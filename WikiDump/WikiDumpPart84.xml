===Overview of integrated approaches to studying and monitoring salt lakes===

Around the world government agencies, researchers &amp; community groups use combined monitoring approaches that measure chemical, physical and biological aspects of a habitat in order to assess the habitat's &quot;health.&quot; Many of these approaches are described online. Well known combined monitoring approaches include protocols for fresh running waters (Barbour ''et al'', 1999), freshwater lakes (Simpson, undated ) and estuaries (Orel &amp; Register, 2002). Protocols for salt lake monitoring are not as easy to locate and so this chapter will endeavour to present several approaches to monitoring salt lakes.


===A basic approach - daily monitoring solar salt-fields for biological health===

Solar saltfields may appear, at first glance to be purely chemical facilities. However they support a distinctive biology that may impact on the production of salt for the benefit, or disadvantage, of the saltfield operator.  Solar saltfield ponds are essentially a series of permanent saline wetlands and as such may exist in a range of ‘stable states’ or ‘ecological regimes’ (Sim ''et al '' 2006, Goldsborough &amp; Robinson 1996)
 
In an ideal situation, the early ponds act as a brine purification wetland, removing nutrients and turbidity while the salinity is increased to the point where crystallisation occurs. At the other extreme the biology of the saltfield, fuelled by nutrients and disturbances, may give rise to an explosion of cyanobacteria that may produce a soluble slime that prevents the salt from crystallising (Coleman and White 1993, Roux 1996).

Monitoring saltfields biology can be a relatively expensive process for smaller operations and monitoring programs are frequently only initiated after a breakdown in field biology. Programs may be cut down, or discontinued, when conditions appear stable. As a result there may not be adequate warning of impending biological catastrophes.

Providing saltfield operators with tools to recognise the outward signs of the main saltfield pond ‘stable states’ can assist them in managing the biology of the field, and may provide them with advance warning that a closer examination of the field biology is called for.

So, which states are the ideal for solar salt production?
Salt crystallises best from low viscosity, clean brines. Such brines are derived from series of ponds that have been maintained, in the majority of cases, in States 1 (lower salinity ponds) and 4a (higher salinity ponds). The image below provides a conceptual diagram that illustrates the visible aspects of each state. Click on the diagram to obtain a larger version.

====What drives the change from one state to another?====

[[File:Saltpondstable2.jpg|centre|thumb|500px|Drivers|centre]]

====Using the drivers as tools====

The simplest tools to manage the biological aspects of a solar saltfield are to assess each pond to determine the most appropriate depth and salinity of brine, and then manage the flow of brine to maintain those two parameters within as narrow a band as possible. This aspect of pond control is an essential part of salt production, and extending the process to include management of the biology is usually relatively simple and economical.

Controlling input of nutrients to the solar saltfield may be simple, or complex. Diversion drains or levees may be needed to ensure surface water runoff from neighbouring agricultural activities does not enter the ponds. Managing the biology to reduce anaerobic events and other disturbances will ensure that nutrient loads are not passed from one pond to another. Where the feed water for the field is eutrophic, there may not be much the saltfield operator can do, other than support efforts of their local authorities to improve the situation.

Finally, biomanipulation may be called for. The three common classes of organisms added to a solar saltfield are herbivores (fish and invertebrates), filter feeders and predators. The first class reduces epiphytic algae and/or macrophyte loads in the ponds, allowing better light penetration and stronger macrophyte growth. Filter feeders such as brine shrimp reduce planktonic turbidity, while predatory fish control herbivore numbers or may be used to reduce the impacts of benthic feeding fish in a field.

====What should saltfield operators look for (monitor)?====

In the lower salinity ponds, the following are good indicators that the pond is maintaining State 1:
#the brine is clear and the pond bottom clearly visible
#extensive beds of seagrasses or widgeon grasses
#the leaves of the seagrasses  are clean with no furry coatings
#there are no, or few, large tangles of fine hair-like green algae growing over the seagrass or widgeon grass beds
#herbivorous birds (e.g. black swans) are feeding on seagrasses and widgeon grasses
#fish eating birds (like pelicans) are actively hunting


In the higher salinity ponds, the following are good indicators that the pond is maintaining State 4a:
#the brine is clear and the pond bottom clearly visible
#any benthic mats are firmly attached to the pond bottom and are not showing signs of breaking up
#there are many brine shrimp visible
#there are flocks of small shorebirds feeding on the brine shrimp

===Other integrated protocols===
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;[More protocols, for specific types of lakes, targeting specific aspects of salt lake health, or looking in greater depth, would be welcome here]&lt;/font&gt;?&lt;br&gt;

==Ingredients==
*1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]], lightly beaten
*2 cups coarsely grated cheddar cheese
*6-8 [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] rashes, chopped
*2 small [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]] finely, chopped
*1 cup self raising [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1 teaspoon of Dijon mustard

==Procedure==
#The first thing to do is combine the milk and egg in a bowl and mix well. Now add cheese, bacon, onions, sifted flour and mustard, then mix until it's MIXED!
#Now drop rounded teaspoons of the mixture onto a tray covered with baking paper.
#Then get some help and or permission to cook them in a hot oven of 200 degrees for about 15 minutes, or until golden.
#Then you can serve them warm or cold and garnished with fresh herbs .</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''externality''' is a cost or benefit incurred by a party's decision or purchase on another, who neither consents, nor is considered in the decision. One example of a negative externality we will consider is pollution.

== Introduction ==

There has been a long-standing interest in the issue of the social or external costs of transportation (see for instance: Keeler et al. 1975 &lt;ref&gt;Keeler, T.E., K. Small and Associates (1975), The Full Costs of Urban Transport, Part III: Automobile Costs and Final Intermodal Cost Comparisons, Monograph No. 212, Institute of Urban and Regional Development, University of California, Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt;, Fuller et al. 1983 &lt;ref&gt;Fuller, John W. et al (1983) Measurements of Highway User Interference Costs and Air Pollution Costs and Noise Damage Costs: Final Report 34 University of Iowa Institute of Urban and Regional Research&lt;/ref&gt;, Mackenzie et al. 1992&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, James, Roger C. Dower, Donald D.T. Chen (1992) The Going Rate: What it Really Costs to Drive World Resources Institute Washington, DC &lt;/ref&gt;,  INRETS 1993 &lt;ref&gt;INRETS (1993) Impact des Transport Terrestres sur L’Environment: Methodes d’evaluation et couts sociaux.  Synthese Inrets No. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;, Miller and Moffet 1993 &lt;ref&gt;Miller, Peter and John Moffet (1993) The Price of Mobility: Uncovering the Hidden Costs of Transportation, National Resources Defense Council&lt;/ref&gt;, IWW/INFRAS 1995 &lt;ref&gt;IWW/INFRAS (1995) The External Effects of Transport for International Union of Railways, Zurich and Karlsruhe&lt;/ref&gt;, IBI 1995 &lt;ref&gt;IBI Group (1995) Full Cost Transportation Pricing Study: Final Report  to Transportation and Climate Change Collaborative.&lt;/ref&gt;). The passions surrounding social costs and transportation, in particular those related to the environment, have evoked far more shadow than light.  At the center of this debate is the question of whether various modes of transportation are implicitly subsidized because they generate externalities, and to what extent this biases investment and usage decisions.  On the one hand,  exaggerations of environmental damages as well as environmental standards formulated without consideration of costs and benefits are used to stop new infrastructure.  On the other hand, the real social costs are typically ignored in financing projects or charging for their use.

Associated with the interest in social and external cost has been a continual definition and re-definition of externalities in transportation systems.  Verhoef (1994)&lt;ref&gt;Verhoef, Erik External Effects and Social Costs of Road Transport Transportation Research A Vol. 28A No. 4 pp. 273-387, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; states “An external effect exists when an actor’s (the receptor’s) utility (or profit) function contains a real variable whose actual value depends on the behavior of another actor (the supplier) who does not take these effects of his behavior into account in this decision making process.”   This definition eliminates pecuniary externalities (for instance, an increase in consumer surplus), and does not include criminal activities or altruism as producers of external benefits or costs.  Rothengatter (1994) &lt;ref&gt;Rothengatter, Werner Do External Benefits Compensate for External Costs of Transport Transportation Research A Vol. 28A No. 4 pp. 321-328, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; presents a similar definition: “an externality is a relevant cost or benefit that individuals fail to consider when making rational decisions.”  Verhoef (1994)  divides external  cost into social, ecological, and intra-sectoral categories, which are caused by vehicles (in-motion or non-in-motion) and infrastructure.  To the externalities we consider (noise, congestion, crashes, pollution), he adds the use of space (e.g. parking) and the use of matter and energy (e.g. the production and disposal of vehicles and facilities).  Button (1994) &lt;ref&gt;Button, Kenneth Alternative Approaches Toward Containing Transport Externalities:  An International Comparison Transportation Research A Vol. 28A No. 4 PP. 289-305, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; classes externalities spatially, considering them to be local (noise, lead, pollution), transboundary (acid rain, oil spills), and global (greenhouse gases, ozone depletion).  Gwilliam and Geerlings (1994) &lt;ref&gt;Gwilliam, Kenneth M. and Harry Geerlings New Technologies and Their Potential to Reduce the Environmental Impact of Transportation Transportation Research A Vol. 28A No. 4 pp. 307-319, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; combines Verhoef’s and Button’s schemes, looking at  a Global, Local, Quality of Life (Social), and Resource Utilization (air, land, water, space, materials) classification.  

Rothengatter (1994) views externalities as occurring at three levels:  individual, partial market, total market, and argues that only the total market level is relevant for checking the need of public interventions.  This excludes pecuniary effects (consumer and producer surplus), activities concerning risk management, activities concerning transaction costs.  Externalities are thus public goods and effects that cannot be internalized by private arrangements. 

Rietveld (1994) &lt;ref&gt;Rietveld, Piet Spatial Economic Impacts of Transport Infrastructure Supply Transportation Research A Vol. 28A No. 4 pp. 329-341, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; identifies temporary effects and non-temporary effects occurring at the demand side and supply side.  Maggi (1994) divides the world by mode (road and rail) and medium (air, water, land) and considers noise, crashes, and community and ecosystem severance.  Though not mentioned among the effects above, to all of this might be added the heat output of transportation. This leads to the “urban heat island” effect -- with its own inestimable damage rate and difficulty of prevention.

Coase (1992) &lt;ref&gt;Coase, R.H. The Problem of Social Cost, and Notes on the Problem of Social Cost reprinted in The Firm, The Market and the Law University of Chicago Press (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the problem is that of actions of firms (and individuals) which have harmful effects on others.  His theorem is restated from Stigler (1966) &lt;ref&gt;Stigler, George 1966 The Theory of Price, 3rd ed. (New York: Macmillan and Col. 1966), 113&lt;/ref&gt; as “... under perfect competition, private and social costs will be equal.”   This analysis extends and controverts the argument of Pigou (1920) &lt;ref&gt;Pigou, A.C. 1920 orig. The Economics of Welfare, 4th ed. (London, Macmillan and Co. 1932)&lt;/ref&gt;, who argued that the creator of the externality should pay a tax or be liable.  Coase suggests the problem is lack of property rights, and notes that the externality is caused by both parties, the polluter and the receiver of pollution.  In this reciprocal relationship, there would be no noise pollution externality if no-one was around to hear.  This theory echoes the Zen question “If a tree falls in the woods and no-one is around to hear, does it make a sound?”.  Moreover, the allocation of property rights to either the polluter or pollutee results in a socially optimal level of production, because in theory the individuals or firms could merge and the external cost would become internal.  However, this analysis assumes zero transaction costs.  If the transaction costs exceed the gains from a rearrangement of activities to maximize production value, then the switch in behavior won’t be made. 

There are several means for internalizing these external costs.  Pigou identifies the imposition of taxes and transfers, Coase suggests assigning property rights, while our government most frequently uses regulation.  To some extent all have been tried in various places and times.  In dealing with air pollution, transferable pollution rights have been created for some pollutants.   Fuel taxes are used in some countries to deter the amount of travel, with an added rationale being compensation for the air pollution created by cars.  The US government establishes pollution and noise standards for vehicles, and requires noise walls be installed along highways in some areas. 
Therefore, a consensus definition might be, “Externalities are costs or benefits generated by a system (in this case transportation, including infrastructure and vehicle/carrier operations,) and borne in part or in whole by parties outside the system.”

== Definitions ==

An [[w:Externality|externality]] is that situation in which the actions of one agent imposes a benefit or cost on another economic agent who is not party to a transaction. 

Externalities are the difference between what parties to a transaction pay and what society pays

* A [[w:Pecuniary externality|pecuniary externality]], increases the price of a resource and therefore involves only transfers, 
* A &lt;i&gt;technical&lt;/i&gt; externality exhibits a real resource effect. A technical externality can be an external benefit (positive) or an external disbenefit (negative).

=== Examples ===

[[w:Externality#Negative|Negative externalities]] (external disbenefits) are air pollution, water pollution, noise, congestion. 

[[w:Externality#Positive|Positive externalities]] (external benefits) include examples such as bees from apiary pollinating fruit trees and orchards supplying bees with nectar for honey.

== Cause ==

The source of externalities is the poorly defined property rights for an asset which is scarce. For example, no one owns the environment and yet everyone does. Since no one has property rights to it, no one will use it efficiently and price it. Without prices people treat it as a free good and do not cost it in their decision making. Overfishing can be explained in the same way.

We want that amount of the externality which is only worth what it costs. Efficiency requires that we set the price of any asset &gt;0 so the externality is internalized. If the price is set equal to the marginal social damages, we will get a socially efficient amount of the good or bad. Economic agents will voluntarily abate if the price is non-zero.

The ''[[w:Coase_theorem|Coase Theorem]]'' states that in the absence of transaction costs, all allocations of property are equally efficient, because interested parties will bargain privately to correct any externality. As a corollary, the theorem also implies that in the presence of transaction costs, government may minimize inefficiency by allocating property initially to the party assigning it the greatest utility.

== Pareto Optimality ==

A change that can make at least one individual better off, without making any other individual worse off is called a Pareto improvement: an allocation of resources is [[w:Pareto efficiency|''Pareto efficient'']] when no further Pareto improvements can be made.

[[Image:TE_SocialCostsDamagesVsProtection.png|thumb|500px|right|Social Costs:  Damages vs. Protection]]
[[Image:TE_SocialCostsSupplyDemand.png|thumb|500px|right|Social Costs: Supply and Demand]]

The tradeoff between benefits and costs is central to most economic analyses. Costs and benefits are both measurable and immeasurable, and a complete analysis must consider transaction and information costs as well as market costs.  Individuals strive to maximize net benefits (benefits after considering costs), society might apply this to social costs as well.  Reducing damages requires increasing protection (defense, abatement, or mitigation) to attenuate the damage.  At some point, the cost of protection outweighs the benefit of reducing residual damages.  This is illustrated in the figure.  Whether this point is at zero damages (no damage is acceptable), zero protection (the damage is so insignificant as to be irrelevant), or somewhere in between is an empirical question.   Total social costs are minimized where the marginal cost of additional damages equals the cost of additional protection.   Whether the marginal costs of damage and of protection are fixed, rising or declining with output, and by how much will be another important empirical question.

The notion of damages and protection is compatible with the idea of supply and demand, as illustrated in the figure to the right.  Here, the change in damages with output (&lt;math&gt;dD/dQ&lt;/math&gt;) is the demand curve (the marginal willingness to pay to avoid damage), and the change in protection (attenuation) with output is the supply curve (marginal cost) and represented as (&lt;math&gt;dA/dQ&lt;/math&gt;).  Again, the slopes of the curves are speculative:

In the next Figure, area A represents the consumer surplus, or the benefit which the community receives from production, and is maximized by producing at qo (marginal cost of protection or attenuation equals the marginal cost of defense).  The shaded area B represents production costs, and is the amount of social cost at the optimal level of production.  Area C is non-satisfied demand, and does not result in any social costs so long as production remains at &lt;math&gt;q_o&lt;/math&gt;.

== Systems ==
[[Image:TE_SocialCostsCauseEffect.png|thumb|500px|right|Social Costs: Causes and Effects. Source:&lt;ref&gt;Button, Kenneth Alternative Approaches Toward Containing Transport Externalities:  An International Comparison Transportation Research A Vol. 28A No. 4 PP. 289-305, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Central to the definition and valuation of exernalities is the definition of the system in question.  The intercity transportation system is open, dynamic, and constantly changing.  Some of the more permanent elements include  airports, intercity highways , and railroad tracks within the state.  The system  also includes the vehicles using those tracks (roads, rails, or airways) at any given time.  Other components are less clear cut - are the roads which access the airports, freeways, or train stations part of the system?  The energy to propel vehicles is part of the system, but is the extraction of resources from the ground (e.g. oil wells) part of the system?  DeLuchi (1991) &lt;ref&gt;DeLuchi, M.A. (1991) Emissions of Greenhouse Gases from the Use of Transportation Fuels and Electricity: Volume 1 Main Text.   Department of Energy: Argonne National Laboratory, Center for Transportation Research, Energy Systems Division. &lt;/ref&gt; analyzes them as part of his life-cycle analysis, but should we?  Where in the energy production cycle does it enter the transportation system?

Any open system influences the world in many ways.  Some influences are direct, some are indirect.  The transportation system is no exception.  Three examples may illustrate the point:

# Cars on roads create noise—this we consider a direct effect.  
# Roads reduce the travel time between two places, which increases the amount of land development along the corridor—this is a less direct effect,  not as immediate or obvious as the first.  Other factors may intervene to cause or prevent this consequence.  
# The new land development along the corridor results in increased demand for public schools and libraries—this is clearly an indirect effect of transportation.  

As can be seen almost immediately, there is no end to the number or extent of indirect effects.  While recognizing that the economy is dynamic and interlinked in an enormous number of ways, we also recognize that it is almost impossible to quantify anything other than proximate, first order, direct effects of the transportation system.  If the degree to which “cause” (transportation) and “effect” (negative externality) are correlated is sufficiently high, then we consider the effect direct; the lower the probability of effect following from cause, the less direct is the effect.  The question of degree of correlation is fundamentally empirical.

On the other hand, this raises some problems.  Automobiles burn fuel that causes pollution directly.  Electric powered high speed rail uses energy from fuel burned in a remote power plant.  If the electricity is fully priced, including social costs, then there is no problem in excluding the power plant.  But, if the social costs of burning fuel in a power plant are not properly priced, then to ignore these costs would be biased.  This is the problem of the ''first best'' and ''second best''.  The idea of the first best solution suggests that we optimize the system under question as if all other sectors were optimal.  The second best solution recognizes that other systems are also suboptimal.  Clearly, other systems are suboptimal to some extent or another.  However, if we make our system suboptimal in response, we lessen the pressure to change the other systems. In so doing we effectively condemn all other solutions to being second best.

Button (1994) develops a model relating ultimate economic causes to negative externalities and their consequences as summarized in the following graphic.  Users and suppliers do not take full account of environmental impacts, leading to excessive use of transport.  Button argues that policy tools are best aimed at economic causes, but in reality measures are aimed at any of four stages.  Here we are considering the middle stage, physical causes and symptoms, and are ignoring feedback effects. 

Another view has the “externalities” as inputs to the production of transportation, along with typical inputs as construction of transportation and the operation and maintenance of the system.  There are multiple outputs, simplified to person trips and freight trips, although of course each person trip is in some respects a different commodity.   This view comports with Becker’s (1965) &lt;ref&gt;Becker, Gary, A Theory of the Allocation of Time - The economic journal, 1965 pp. 493--517  &lt;/ref&gt; view that households use time in the production of commodities -- of which travel might be one.

== Theory ==
[[Image:NegativeExternalityGraphic.png|thumb|500px|right]]

To establish optimal emission levels for pollution, congestion or any other externality consider the following framework. All emissions, damages, and costs are from one or more sources &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, subscripts are omitted for clarity.

&lt;math&gt;C(a)=C(z-e)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;C(a)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the Cost of Abatement function with 
* &lt;math&gt;C(a)' &gt; 0 \,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C(a)'' \ge 0 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt; D = D(e) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;D(e) \,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the Cost of Damages function due to emissions .
* &lt;math&gt;e\,\!&lt;/math&gt;is the actual emission from source.
* &lt;math&gt;z\,\!&lt;/math&gt;  is the  amount of emission at source  in an uncontrolled state.
* &lt;math&gt;a = z - e\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is  the amount of abatement at source.   

Note if &lt;math&gt;a =0 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;,  and thus &lt;math&gt;   z = e\,\!&lt;/math&gt; the actual emissions equal the maximum amount possible.

The solution to the problem is to minimize the sum of damage costs and abatement costs or

&lt;math&gt;\min D(e)+C(z-e)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta D}{ \delta e}=\frac{\delta C}{ \delta a} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

which indicates a constant marginal demand function.


The following is true:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{ \delta D}{ \delta e}=\frac{ \delta C}{ \delta a}\bullet \frac{\partial a}{\partial e} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \therefore \frac{\delta D}{ \delta e}=\frac{ \delta C}{ \delta a} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


This states that the optimal amount of any externality is established by minimizing the sum of damage and abatement costs so we end up with E* amount of aggregate pollution. 

If a profit maximizing firm were faced with an abatement charge they would internalize the externality or abate until the marginal cost of abatement were equal to the price of pollution or the change.

== Government Standards ==

If the government wanted to establish a 'standard' it would require knowledge of:
* level of marginal damages
* Marginal Cost function of polluters

It would therefore appear that there is an informational advantage to pricing.

The solution which has been illustrated above also applies with:
* spatially differentiated damages
* non-linear damage functions
* non-competitive market settings

Standards dominate charged because

* Uncertainty with respect to the marginal damage function.
* Uncertainty with respect to the marginal abatement costs.

=== Uncertainty with respect to marginal damage function ===

Now consider the situation where the MC of abatement has been underestimated so the true MC of abatement lies above the estimated MC of abatement function. Consider a standards scheme. Using the estimated MC of abatement the emission level is set at e instead of e*. Thus, the emission level is too low relative to the optimum. With the level of abatement too high, the damages reduced due to having this lower level of emissions is eAce* but at the cost of much higher abatement costs of eBCe*. The net social loss will be ABC.

[[Image:TE-NegativeExternalities-UncertaintyMDF.png]]

Alternatively, suppose the authority set a sub-optimal emission standard of e because it is using the erroneous MD function. With emissions at e rather than e*, we again end up with a net social loss of ABC. Therefore, uncertainty with respect to the marginal damage function provides NO ADVANTAGE to either scheme; pricing or standards.

=== Uncertainty with respect to marginal abatement costs ===

Now consider the situation where the MC of abatement has been underestimated so the true MC of abatement lies above the estimated MC of abatement function. Consider a standards scheme. Using the estimated MC of abatement the emission level is set at e instead of e*. Thus, the emission level is too low relative to the optimum. With the level of abatement too high, the damages reduced due to having this lower level of emissions is eAce* but at the cost of much higher abatement costs of eBCe*. The net social loss will be ABC

Now consider a pricing scheme. The authority would set the emission charge at EC by setting the MD function equal to the MC of abatement function. This would result in a level of emission of e; thinking this is the correct amount. But with a true MC of abatement at MCT the level of emissions which the charge EC will generate will be e'. 

e' &gt; e* so we have too high a level of emissions. Pollution damages will increase by the amount e*CDe' but the abatement costs will be reduced (because of higher allowed emissions) by e*CEe'. Therefore, the net social loss will be CDE.
Generally, there is no reason to expect CDE = ABC but it has been shown that

&lt;math&gt;WL_{T}=WL_{q}=0.5\left( \frac{EC}{E} \right)\bullet \left( \Delta e \right)^{2}\left( \frac{1}{\varepsilon _{D}}+\frac{1}{\varepsilon _{C}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;WL_{T}&lt;/math&gt; is the welfare loss from pricing
* &lt;math&gt;WL_{q}&lt;/math&gt; is the welfare loss from standards
* &lt;math&gt;\Delta e&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;e'-e&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon _{D}&lt;/math&gt; is the elasticity of the marginal damage function
* &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon _{C}&lt;/math&gt; is the elasticity of the marginal cost of abatement function



The welfare loss from pricing and standards will be equal if 
1.  =  in absolute value
or
2. &lt;math&gt;\Delta e = 0&lt;/math&gt;  or &lt;math&gt;MC_{A} = MC_{T} &lt;/math&gt;

Standards will be preferred to charges when &lt;math&gt;WL_{T} - WL_{q} &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; which occurs when 

&lt;math&gt;\left| \varepsilon _{D} \right|&lt;\left| \varepsilon _{C} \right|&lt;/math&gt;. 

If &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon _{C} &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; charges are preferred while if &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon _{D} &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; standards are preferred.

=== Rationale ===

The rationale for this is:

* if the MD function is steep (e.g. with very toxic pollution) even a slight error in &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; will generate large damages. With uncertainty about costs, the chances of such errors is greater with a charging scheme.

* if the MD function is flat, a charge will better approximate marginal damages. If the damage function is linear, the optimal result is independent of any knowledge about costs.

* if the MC is steep, an ambitious standard could result in excessive costs to abators. A charge places an upper limit on costs.
Therefore, the KEY in this is charges set an upper limit on costs while standards set an upper limit on discharges.




[[Image:TE-NegativeExternalties-UncertaintyMAC.png]]

== Prices ==

Externality prices can take three forms:

1. use to optimize social surplus

2. use to achieve a predetermined standard at least cost]

3. use to induce compliance to a particular standard

Perhaps the best know 'cure' for the congestion externality facing most major cities has been advocated by economists; road pricing. Standards are achieved in this instance by continuing to build roads.



== Measurement ==

The cost of an externality is a function of two equations.  The first relates the physical production of the externality to the amount of transportation output.  The second computes the economic cost per unit of externality.  The amount of an externality produced by transportation is the result of the technology of the transportation, as well as the amount of defense and abatement measures undertaken.  There are several issues of general concern in the physical production of externalities.   They are classified as:  fungibility, geography, life cycle, technology, and point of view.  Each are addressed in turn.

=== Fungibility=== 

“Is the externality fungible?”   In other words, does the externality which is physically produced by the system under question have to be eliminated or paid for, or can something substitute for it.  For example, a car may produce X amount of Carbon Dioxide.  If carbon dioxide were not fungible, then that X would need to be eliminated, or a tax assessed based on the damage that X causes.  However, if it were fungible, then an equivalent amount X could be eliminated through some other means (for instance, by installing pollution control on a factory or by planting trees).  The second option may be cheaper, and this may influence the economic effects of the pollution generated.

=== Geography ===
“Over what area are the externalities considered?”  “Is a cost generated by a project in California which is borne by those outside California relevant?”  This is particularly important in estimating environmental costs, many of which are global in nature.  If we try to estimate damages (rather than the protection costs of defense, abatement, and mitigation), this becomes particularly slippery.  However, if we can assume fungibility, and use the cost of mitigation techniques, the measurement problem becomes much simpler.  Ideally, we would obtain estimates for both protection and damages in order to determine the tradeoffs.

=== Life Cycle=== 

In some respects we would like to view the life-cycle of the transportation system.  But it becomes more difficult to consider the life-cycle of every input to the transportation system.  The stages which may be considered include:  Pre-production, construction, utilization, refurbishing, destruction, and disposal. Ignoring the life-cycle of all inputs may create some difficulties.  Electric power will produce pollution externalities at production in a power plant, before it enters the transportation system.  Thus, modes using electric power (rail, electric cars), would be at an advantage using this decision rule over modes which burn fuel during the transport process (airplanes, gasoline powered cars, diesel trains).  This is true, though to a lesser extent, with other inputs as well.  

=== Technology=== 
The technology involved in transportation is constantly changing.  The automobile fleet on the ground in 2000 will have very different characteristic than that in the year 1900 regarding the number of externalities produced.  Hopefully, cars will be safer, cleaner, and quieter.  Similar progress will no doubt be made in aircraft and trains.  While the analysis will initially assume current technology, sensitivity tests should consider the effect that an improved fleet will have on minimizing externality production.

=== Macro vs. Micro Analysis Scale ===
Estimates for externalities typically come in two forms macro and micro levels of analysis.  Macroscopic analysis uses national (or global) estimates of costs as share of gross domestic product (GDP), such as Kanafani (1983), Quinet (1990), and Button (1994).  The data for microscopic  analysis is far more dispersed.  It relies on numerous engineering and empirical cost-benefit and micro-economic studies.  By and large, this study is a microscopic  analysis, though, on occasion, the macroscopic numbers will be used as benchmarks for comparison and estimates of data where not otherwise available.  This will be true for both the physical production of externalities as well as their economic costs through damages borne or protection/attenuation measures.  
Once cost estimates are produced, they can be expanded to estimate the state-wide social costs of transport as a share of state product (California GDP), which can be compared with other national estimates.

== Issues ==


Two important issues of concern in measuring the economic cost of externalities  are:  the basis over which the output is measured and the consistency of the measurement .  When estimating the full cost of externalities, the amount of externality is not simply the amount of traffic on the road multiplied by some externality rate.  Rather, it must be measured as the difference between what is generated systemwide with and without the facility.  For instance, a new freeway lane will have several effects: diverting existing traffic from current facilities, inducing new traffic on the new facility, and inducing new/different traffic on the old facility.  The amount of this change must be accurately determined with a general equilibrium approach to estimate demand.  In a general equilibrium approach, the travel time/cost used to estimate the amount of demand is equal to the travel time/cost resulting from that demand.  Switching traffic from an older facility to a newer facility may in fact reduce the amount of negative externalities generated.   For instance, the number of accidents or their severity may decline if the new facility is safer than the old.  On the other hand, the induced traffic, while certainly a benefit in that it increases commerce, also imposes new additional costs, more accidents, pollution and noise.  It is the net change which must be considered.

When addressing the costs of externalities, the estimates used across all externalities should be consistent.   Cost estimates contain implicit assumptions, particularly concerning the value of time, life, and safety.  Key questions can be asked of any study:

* Is the value of life and health used in estimating the cost of accidents the same as used in estimating the human effects of pollution? 

* Is the value of time used consistent between congestion costs and   accidents?  With congestion, many are delayed a small time,  crashes (ignoring congestion implications), a few are delayed a long time.

== Cost-Function Estimation Methods ==

Many approaches have been undertaken to estimate the costs of externalities.  The first class of approaches we call “Damage” based methods, the second can be called  “Protection” based methods.   The damage based methods begin with the presumption that there is an externality and it causes X amount of damage through lower property values, quality of life, and health levels.   

The protection methods estimate the cost to protect against a certain amount of the externality through abatement, defense, or mitigation.  One example of a defense measure is thicker windows in a house to reduce noise from the road.  An abatement measure would have the highway authority construct noise walls to reduce noise or require better mufflers on vehicles.  A mitigation measure may only be applicable for certain types of externalities;  e.g. increased safety measures that reduce accidents on one facility also offset the increased number of accidents on another facility.  

Rising marginal costs are expected of protection measures.  The first quantity of externality abated /defended/mitigated is cheaper than the second and so on because the most cost-effective measures are undertaken first.  This is not to say there are no economies of scale in mitigating externalities within a given mitigation technology.  It merely suggests that between technologies, costs will probably rise. 
The mitigation approach can be applied if we consider the externality fungible.  Air pollution from the road may cause as much damage as an equivalent amount of pollution from nearby factories.  The most cost effective approach to eliminating the amount of pollution produced by the road may come from additional scrubbers on the factory.  While it may be prohibitively expensive to eliminate 100% of roadway pollution from the roadway alone, it may be quite reasonable to eliminate the same amount of pollution from the system.  Determining the most effective method of mitigating each system-wide externality requires understanding the nature of its  fungibility.

Neither of these two approaches (Damages or Protection) will necessarily produce a single value for the cost of a facility.  It is more likely that each approach will produce a number of different cost estimates based on how it is undertaken and what assumptions are made.  This reinforces the need for sensitivity analyses and a well-defined “systems” approach.
We divide the techniques of costing into three main categories:  revealed preference, stated preference, and implied preference.  Revealed preference is based on observed conditions and how individuals subject to the externality behave, stated preference comes from surveys of individuals in hypothetical situations, while implied preference looks at the cost which is implied based on legislative, executive, or judicial decisions.

=== Revealed Preference ===
The revealed preference approach attempts to determine the cost of an externality by determining how much damage reduces the price of a good.    

Revealed preference can also be used to estimate the price people pay for various protection (defense/ abatement) measures and the effectiveness of those measures. For instance, insulation costs a certain amount of money and provides a certain amount of effectiveness in reducing noise.  The extent to which individuals then purchase insulation or double-glazed windows may suggest how much they value quiet.  However, individuals may be willing to spend some money (but less than the cost of insulation) if they could ensure quiet by some other means which they do not control - but which may be technically feasible.

'''Hedonic Models:''' The most widely used estimates of the cost of noise are derived from hedonic models.  These assume that the price of a good (for instance a home) is composed of a number of factors: square	footage, accessibility, lot area, age of home, pollution, noise, etc.  Using a regression analysis, the parameters for each of these factors are estimated.  From this, the decline in the value of housing with the increase in the amount of noise can be estimated.  This has been done widely for estimating the social cost of road noise and airport noise on individual homes. In theory, the value of commercial real estate may be similarly influenced by noise.  In our literature review thus far, no study of this sort has been found.  Furthermore, although noise impacts public buildings, this method cannot be used as a measure since public buildings are not sold.  Similarly, when determining some of the costs of noise, one could investigate how much individuals might be willing to pay for vehicles which are quieter.  Like a home, a hedonic model of vehicle attributes could be estimated.  A vehicle is a bundle of attributes (room, acceleration, MPG, smooth ride, quiet, quality of workmanship, accessories) which influence its price, also an attribute. 

'''Unit/Cost Approach:'''  A simple method, the “unit cost (Rate) approach” is used often for allocating costs in transit.  This method assigns each cost element, somewhat arbitrarily, to a single output measure or cost center (for instance, Vehicle Miles Travel, Vehicle Hours Travel, Number of Vehicles, Number of Passengers) based on the highest statistical correlation of the cost with output.  

'''Wage/Risk Study:'''  A means for determining the economic cost of risk to life or health or general discomfort is by analyzing wage/salary differentials based on job characteristics, including risk as a factor. 

'''Time Use Study:'''  This approach measures the time used to reduce some risk by a certain amount.  For instance, seatbelts reduce the risk of injury or using  pedestrian overpass may reduce the risk of being hit by a car. The time saved has a value, which may inform estimates of risk aversion.

'''Years Lost plus Direct Cost:'''  This method estimates the number of years lost to an accident due to death and years lost from non-fatal injuries.  It also  the monetary costs of non-life damages.  However, it defines life in monetary terms.  While it may have some humanistic advantages in that it does not place a dollar value on life, defining life through dollars and sense may have some practical value.  Defining life through dollars and sense may help us assess whether an improvement, with a certain construction cost and life-saving potential, is economically worthwhile.

'''Comprehensive:'''  This accident costing method extends the Years Lost plus 	Direct Cost method by placing a value on human life.  The value is assessed  looking at the tradeoffs people make when choosing to conduct an activity  a certain risk level versus another activity at a different risk, but different  cost/time.   Studies are based both on what people actually pay and what are willing to pay, and use a variety of revealed preference techniques.  This is the preferred method of the US Federal Highway Administration.

'''Human Capital:'''  The Human Capital approach  is an accounting approach which focuses on the accident victim’s productive capacity or potential output, using the discounted present value of future earnings.  To this are added costs such as property damage and medical costs.  Pain and suffering can added as well.  The Human Capital approach can be used for accidents, environmental health, and possibly congestion costs .  It is used in the Australian study Social Cost of Road Accidents (1990) &lt;ref&gt;Australian Bureau of Transport and Communications (1992) Social Cost of Road Accidents in Australia,  Economics Report 79, Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra, Australia &lt;/ref&gt;.  However, Miller (1992) &lt;ref&gt;Miller, Ted (1992) The Costs of Highway Crashes, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA-RD-91-055)&lt;/ref&gt; and others discount the method because the only effect of injury that counts is the out-of-pocket cost plus lost work and housework.  By extension, it places low value on children and perhaps even a negative value on the elderly.  While measuring human capital is a necessary input to the costs of accidents, it cannot be the only input.

=== Stated Preference ===
Stated preference involves using hypothetical questions to determine individual preferences regarding the economic costs of a facility.  There are two primary classes of stated preference studies: Contingent Valuation and Conjoint Analysis.

'''Contingent Valuation:''' Perhaps the most straight-forward way of determining  the cost of an externality is asking the hypothetical questions, “How much you  would a person pay to reduce externality by a certain amount” or “How  would a person pay to avoid the imposition of a certain increment of externality”.  Jones-Lee (1990) &lt;ref&gt;Jones-Lee, Michael The Value of Transport Safety. Oxford Review of Economic Policy, Vol. 6, No. 2, Summer 1990 pp. 39-60&lt;/ref&gt; has been the foremost investigator into this  method for determining the cost of noise.  This method can, in theory, be  applied to any recipient of noise, although it has generally been asked of the  neighbors (or potential neighbors) of a transportation facility.There are several difficulties with this approach.  The first difficulty with any stated preference approach  is that people give hypothetical answers to hypothetical questions.  Therefore, the method should be calibrated to a revealed preference approach (with actual results for similar situations) before being relied upon as a sole source of information.  The second regards the question of “rights”.  For instance, someone who believes he has the right to quiet will not answer this question in the same way as someone who doesn’t.  The third involves individuals who may claim infinite value to some commodity, which imposes difficulties for economic analysis.

'''Conjoint Analysis:'''  To overcome the problems with contingent valuation, conjoint analysis has been used.  Conjoint analysis requires individuals to tradeoffs between one good (e.g. quiet) and another (e.g. accessibility) has been used to better measure the cost of noise, as in Toronto by Gillen (1990) &lt;ref&gt;Gillen, David (1990) The Management of Airport Noise, DWG Research Associates for Transport Development Centre, Transport Canada, July 1990&lt;/ref&gt;.  
 
	
=== Implied Preference ===
There are methods for measuring the costs of externalities which are neither revealed from individual decisions nor stated by individuals on a survey.  These are called implied preference because they are derived from regulatory or court-derived costs.

'''Regulatory Cost:'''  Through government regulation, costs are imposed  society with the aim of reducing the amount of noise or pollution or hazard  is produced.  These regulations include vehicle standards (e.g. mufflers) roadway abatement measures such as noise walls, as well as the many environmental regulations.  By determining the costs and benefits of these regulations, the implicit cost of each externality can be estimated.  This measure assumes that government is behaving consistently and rationally when imposing various standards or undertaking different projects.

'''Judicial Opinion and Negotiated Compensation:'''  Similar to the implicit cost  measure, one can look at how courts (judges and juries) weigh costs and  benefits in cases which come before them.  The cost per unit of noise or life  from these judgments can be determined.  This method is probably more viable  in accident cases.

== Incidence, Cost Allocation, and Compensation ==

This final set of topics deal with incidence (who causes the externality), cost allocation (who suffers from the externality), and compensation (how can the costs be appropriated and compensation paid fairly).

=== Incidence ===

The general model is that the costs can be generated by one of several parties and fall on one of several parties.  The parties in this case are: the vehicle operators and carriers; the road, track, and airport operators; and the rest of society.

* Vehicle Operators and Carriers: bus company, truck company, driver of a car,  railroad, airline
* Road/Track/Airport Operator:  Department of Transportation, railroad, airport  authority
* Society: the citizenry, government, citizens of other states/countries, the  environment

This conceptual model is not concerned with anything smaller than the level of a vehicle. How costs on a vehicle are attributed to passengers in the vehicle, or the costs of freight carriage to the shipper, is not our concern.  Similarly, ownership is not an issue, the operator of a vehicle may not be the owner, in the case, for instance, of a rented car.  Obviously there is some overlap here between vehicle operators and road and track operators.   In the case of American railroads, the firm which operates trains usually owns the track, although often a train will ride on tracks owned by a different railroad.   Moreover, for some means of transportation, but not those considered here, there may be no vehicles (for example pipelines and conveyor belts.)

Costs can be imposed by any party on any party. As an illustration of how this works, we look at noise. Transportation noise is generated by vehicles in motion, and can affect any of the following classes: self, other vehicle users, and local society.  There is noise generated by the roadway or the rail during construction, but this is ignored, and the noise does not actually hurt the road and track operators (except indirectly where they are held responsible for noise generated by vehicles and must build noise walls or other abatement measures.)   A similar situation occurs with airports.  Technically the planes make almost all of the noise, but the airport is held responsible.  That noise is generated by  wheels on pavement and thus depends in some respects on the roadway operator is also ignored. 
* Vehicle operator on self,  on other vehicles.  For instance, one of the attributes of a vehicle (an auto say) is its quietness, this is reflected in the price of the vehicle.  Quietness has two aspects: insulation, which protects the cab from noise generated by the car and other vehicles; and noise generation, which is how noisy the car is to itself and others.  The noise generated by the vehicle and heard within the cab are internal costs, while those generated by the vehicle and heard by others is  external to the vehicle operator, but internal to the transportation system.
* Vehicle operator on society.  The noise generated by a vehicle negatively impacts the usefulness and flexibility of land uses nearby, where the impact declines with distance.  The decline in utility is reflected in land values.  The costs are clearly external to both the operator and the transportation system.

=== Cost Allocation ===
Clearly there are external costs, but it is not always clear who should bear them.   This issue brings about questions of cost allocation.  These include: objectives - for what reason are we allocating costs, methodology - how are we allocating costs, structure - how do we break down costs, and problems - how do we deal with the thorny issues of common and joint costs and cross-subsidies.

The first question that must be asked is what are the objectives of cost allocation.  There are several contenders, which unfortunately are not entirely compatible. These include equity, efficiency,  effectiveness,  and acceptability. 

The first consideration is equity or fairness.  This concept raises a series of question summarized as “equity for whom”.  Depending on how you slice it, different “fair” solutions are possible. The classic divisions are vertical vs. horizontal equity.  Horizontal equity is a fair allocation of costs between users in the same sector, vertical equity is fairness across sectors.  Are the costs allocated “fairly” between users, between facilities, between modes, between economic sectors?  Is the burden for the project shared fairly between the economy and the environment? 
The second consideration is efficiency.  Somewhat clearer than equity, efficiency still raises the same questions of “for whom.”  Is the allocation efficient for the user, the operator, the state, the country?  Does it consider inefficiencies, subsidies and taxes in other sectors of the economy, or other components of the transportation system?  Efficiency can also be stratified into two categories: theoretical and practical..  The first ignores implementation (information and transaction) costs that rise with the number of charges imposed.  Moreover, economists identify three kinds of efficiency: Allocative, which aims for the optimal mix of goods; Productive, which attempts to attain the minimum average cost; and Dynamic, which seeks long term optimal investment or capital rationing. Allocative efficiency may be thought of as congestion pricing, to ensure the optimal use of a transportation facility.  Productive efficiency will attempt to raise enough money to operate and maintain the physical plant at the lowest cost.  Dynamic efficiency will attempt to raise money to finance the facility, proactively or retroactively.  To what extent these goals coincide is unclear.  

Contrasted with efficiency is effectiveness.  While the test of efficiency asks if the system is achieving its goals with minimum effort, the test of effectiveness asks if the system’s goals or output measures are consistent with broader societal goals.  For instance, an efficient road may move traffic through a neighborhood at a high rate of speed, but this may be ineffective in meeting the broader social goal of a higher quality of life in the neighborhood, which the traffic disrupts.  Costs can be allocated which achieve an efficient use of resources, but result in an ineffective or counter-productive system.

Added to this, we will consider the profit motive.  If the facility is constructed by a profit seeking firm, prices will reflect an attempt at profit maximization in either a competitive, monopolistic, or oligopolistic environment.

A last consideration is acceptability.  A system, which may have desirable attributes, if  unimplemented,  serves no-one.  In the political world, tradeoffs and compromises must be made to achieve progress.

Costs can be allocated based on who causes them or by who receives benefit from them.  There are pricing schemes reflecting both.  There is a dichotomy between the methods of cost allocation suggested by economists and the approaches taken by engineers (as well as the official policy of the US government through modal cost allocation studies).  

At least three economic approaches can be taken for allocating costs. The economic top-down approaches take equations of cost and allocate the results to users, these are: average total cost per user,  average variable cost per user,  and marginal cost (short run and long run), the last of which is favored by economists.

On the other hand, engineers working from the bottom-up break the system into components, which are assigned to users.  Each mode or carrier has somewhat different methods for cost allocation.  These are summarized below:
* Fixed Allocation - a set fee is charged based on some previous study
* Industry Agreed Upon (e.g. General Managers Associations Rules - rules allocating costs of freight cars on foreign rails, a pre-established agreement)
* Zero Allocation - user gets free ride on common costs and pays only attributable costs
* Proportional (New Investment/Long Range Pricing) - divides variable and fixed costs to users in proportion to use 
* Minimum Cost of Service: Avoidable Cost Allocation  (hierarchy costs/avoidable costs/separable costs/remaining benefits) - assigns to a beneficiary only the costs which could be avoided if the beneficiary did not use the service
* Minimum Cost of Service: Attributable Cost Allocation - assigns as cost allocation + share of common costs based on use.
* Minimum Cost of Service: Priority of Use Cost Allocation - assigns attributable cost allocation, but charges extra if priority is given to user or discounts if priority is taken from user (e.g. queue jumping)

In addition to the centralized cost allocation methods described above, there are other methods of allocation to users:
* Negotiated contracts - the parties negotiate the charge based on individual circumstances.  This is often used in the rail industry where the trains of one carrier use the tracks of another.
* Arbitration - like a negotiated contract, but where a third party makes ultimate decision on the charge.
* Regulatory finding - A regulatory agency such as the former Interstate  Commerce Commission gathers information and makes a decision as to  appropriate rate.  This is now most widely used in cases of monopoly oligopoly practice.
* Legislative finding - A legislature assumes the role of regulatory agency and  prices and/or conditions of the cost allocation.  An example of this is the adoption of taxes supporting the highway system, where gas taxes, vehicle licenses, and truck charges as well as tolls have to be approved by the state legislature.
* Judicial finding - After some dispute between parties (carrier vs. carrier, carrier vs. government or government vs. government) a court may be called on to make a final decision.
* Ramsey Pricing Rule -  This rule would charge based on the customer’s elasticity of demand.  The more elastic the customer (the more options he has the lower his price.  So long as the short run marginal cost is covered, it may  worthwhile for one firm to use this pricing rule to keep customers using their service rather than a competitors.
* Discriminating Monopolist/Oligopolist  An unregulated monopoly  discriminate among customers to obtain higher revenues (capture the consumer surplus).  There are three classes of monopolistic discrimination: (1st degree, degree, 3rd degree).

The engineering and economic cost allocation discussed above allocate the costs to users.  But there are alternative approaches:
* General Revenue:  If transportation is to be subsidized, then the general 	public (including both users and non-users) can be charged a certain percentage of costs.  This is seen when using general tax revenue for transportation.  
* Value Capture: Similarly, another transfer occasionally used is a “value capture” approach, whereby nearby landowners are taxed based on the increase  property value owing to a new transportation facility, this has been used in Angeles around new transit stations.  In practice, some of each approach may be used.

=== Compensation ===
If individuals and organizations who cause externalities are to be charged, those who receive the unwanted noise, pollution, etc. should be compensated.  To the extent that the recipients are amorphous, such as ''the environment'', the collected funds should be expended in that sector for remediation of damages or their mitigation ahead of time.  Also, the health damages from environmental damage are typically diffuse. On the other hand, it is fairly clear who suffers from noise.  But the externality gets buried in the land price immediately after the opening (or perhaps announcement) of a facility.  Therefore only the land owner at that time should receive compensation.  
Crashes result in damages to several classes of parties: those involved in crashes (and their families and insurance companies), commuters delayed by crashes (though this may be better treated in the congestion section), and society at large.  Those involved are largely covered privately through the insurance sector, and care must be taken to avoid double-counting.  

Congestion is typically divided into two classes: recurring and non-recurring.  Non-recurring congestion is most often caused by incidents (traffic accidents, inclement weather).  The value of time for these may be different, as recurring congestion probably entails less schedule delay since it is already accounted for by most commuters.  Money raised from congestion pricing, in addition to reducing traffic volumes,  can be used to expand capacity further to alleviate congestion.  But this does not compensate those who now take a slower (but cheaper mode of transport) after road pricing is in effect.  A question arises as to whether those individuals have some right to free travel which is being eliminated through pricing, or whether some general subsidies for travel are warranted.  Congestion has further issues concerning pricing, for instance the peak vs. off-peak. When there is more traffic, each additional vehicle has more and more impact, suggesting higher tolls in the peak.  However, the tolls will reduce demand, so an equilibrium solution to the problem is essential.

Social severance and visual impact are also amorphous.  They will be difficult to price.   To some extent for visual impact, the neighbors of a project can be identified and damages defined in terms of lower property values.   In terms of the aesthetic quality of a trip, it may be conceptually possible to compare to parallel routes (a parkway vs. a freeway), one ''prettier'' than the other, and see if there is a difference in traffic volumes other than that explained by a route choice model.   The difference in volume gives an implied choice of the value of the route in terms of additional time (and thus money), which may be significant in tourist areas.  There is also a risk aspect to travel, drivers may choose certain roads which are through ''good areas'', because they do not want to break down in isolated areas or perceived bad neighborhoods. 

The social aspects of disruption of community (after taking into account net change in property value before and after infrastructure accounting for all of accessibility (increase or decrease), noise, and visual impact) is extremely difficult to determine.  A political solution may need to be found to pricing and arranging for compensation.

== Evidence on Pollution ==

Transportation sources in North America contribute approximately 

* 47% of nitrogen oxide emissions (NOx)
* 71% of carbon monoxide emissions (CO) 
* 39% of hydrocarbon emissions (HC)

== Standards vs. Prices ==

To control most pollutants we have opted for [[w:National Ambient Air Quality Standards|standards]] rather than pricing. This is reflected in the 'level of allowed emissions' with catalytic converters on our vehicles.

[[w:Noise pollution|Noise]] is another example where the U.S. has opted for a technological fix to achieve a standard. Europeans have, however, introduced noise charges at some airports for aircraft which exceed a particular noise level.

== Private Cost v. Social Cost ==

The purpose of distinguishing [[w:Cost#Comparing private, external, social, and psychic costs|private]] and [[w:Social cost|social cost]] is to correct for real resource misallocation from economic agents actions which impose a cost (or benefit) on others in the market. The market provides no incentive for agents to take account of their actions.

The difference between private and social cost is that in making a decision a private individual will take account of the costs they face but will not consider the impact of their decision on others which may, in fact. impose a cost upon them. If this occurs an externality will misallocate resources since the economic agents are not forced to pay the cost they impose or does not receive any compensation for the benefits which they confer.

== Full Cost Model ==
Based on: &lt;ref&gt;Levinson, David, David Gillen, and Adib Kanafani (1998) [http://nexus.umn.edu/Papers/SocialCost.pdf A Comparison of the Social Costs of Air and Highway]. Transport Reviews 18:3 215-240.)&lt;/ref&gt;


An essential first step in examining transportation issues and in making sound decisions on transportation systems is to understand the full cost of transportation today, including the social costs of crashes, air pollution, noise, and congestion as well as the internal costs of providing and operating the infrastructure. Furthermore, if cross subsidies between modes, user groups, or areas of the country or states are to be avoided, and if users are to pay the full cost of providing and maintaining the transportation system, then it is important to know what proportion of total costs users currently pay and what proportion is borne by others. Such a complete assessment of the full cost of the different modes of transportation for intercity travel has been lacking. The development of cost models and estimates of the type presented in this research are essential to gauging the true costs of transportation in the different modes, and is a prerequisite to sound investment decisions. 


The full cost calculation includes the cost of building, operating, and maintaining infrastructure, as well as carrier, user,  and social costs. Social costs include noise, air pollution, and accident costs, as well as congestion costs.  User costs include the cost of purchasing, maintaining and operating a vehicle such as a car, and the cost of travel time.  
We begin by developing a taxonomy for representing the full costs of transportation, independent of mode:

* Infrastructure Costs &lt;math&gt;C_I &lt;/math&gt;- including capital costs of construction and debt service, and costs of  maintenance and operating costs as well as service costs to government or private sector;
* Carrier Costs &lt;math&gt;&lt;/math&gt;- aggregate of all payments by carriers in capital costs to purchase a vehicle fleet), and maintain and operate a vehicle fleet (COC), minus those costs (such as usage charges) which are transfers to infrastructure, which we label  Carrier Transfers.
* User Money Costs &lt;math&gt;C_U&lt;/math&gt;- aggregate of all fees, fares and tariffs paid by users in capital costs to purchase a vehicle,  and money spent to maintain and operate the vehicle or to ride on a carrier (UOC); less those costs (such as fares) which are transfers to carriers or infrastructure, and accident insurance, which is considered under social costs, which we label User Transfers&lt;math&gt;T_U&lt;/math&gt;.
* User Travel Time Costs &lt;math&gt;C_T&lt;/math&gt;- the amount of time spent traveling under uncongested conditions multiplied by the monetary value of time.
* User Delay Costs&lt;math&gt;C_D&lt;/math&gt;-  the amount of time spent traveling under congested conditions minus the amount of time spent traveling in uncongested conditions multiplied by the monetary value of time.
* Social Costs - additional net external costs to society due to emissions &lt;math&gt;C_E&lt;/math&gt;, crashes &lt;math&gt;C_A&lt;/math&gt;, and noise &lt;math&gt;C_N&lt;/math&gt;  and are true resource costs used in making and using transportation services;

	The method used to estimate the full cost &lt;math&gt;C_{Full}&lt;/math&gt;  of intercity travel will combine elements from a number of sources. Adding and subtracting the above factors, thereby avoiding double-counting,  we have the following equation, the components of which will be dealt with in turn in the paper:




&lt;math&gt;C_{Full} = (C_U - T_U) + C_I + C_E + C_N + C_A + C_T &lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:TE-NegativeExternalities-Congestion.png]]

==== Valuation ====

The value of time depends on a number of factors (Hensher 1995).   Among them are the mode of travel, the time of day, the purpose (business, non-business) of the trip, the quality or level of service of the trip (including speed), and the specific characteristics of the trip-maker, including income.   Furthermore, the value of time saved probably depends on the amount of time saved - 60 people saving 1 minute may not be worth the same as 1 person saving 60 minutes.  Time in motion is valued differently than time spent waiting.  Similarly schedule delay, the amount of time between when one wants to depart and the next scheduled service (bus, train, plane) also has a value associated with it.   Unexpected delays are more costly than the expected, since those are built into decisions.  All of these factors need to be considered in a detailed operational analysis of the costs of travel time and congestion.   

Value of Time is a function of mode, time of day, purpose, quality of service, trip-maker.  

Wide range, typically $50/hr air, $30/hr car. (Business Trips more valuble than Personal Trips).

On other hand, average hourly PCI rate (40 hour week) gives $10/hr

The principal means for estimating the cost of crashes is to estimate their damage costs.  The method presented here uses a comprehensive approach which includes valuing years lost to the accident as well as direct costs.  Several steps must be undertaken: converting injuries to years of life, developing a value of life, and estimating other costs.  Placing a value on injury requires measuring its severity.  Miller (1993) describes a year of functional capacity (365 days/year, 24 hours/day) as consisting of several dimensions: Mobility, Cognitive, Self Care, Sensory, Cosmetic, Pain, Ability to perform household responsibilities, and Ability to perform wage work.   The following Tables show the percent of hours lost by degree of injury, and the functional years lost by degree of injury.

Central to the estimation of costs is an estimate of the ''value of life'' (or ''value of a statistical life'').  Numerous studies have approached this question from various angles.  Jones-Lee (1988) provides one summary, with an emphasis on British values from revealed and stated preference studies.  The FAA (1989) provides another summary.  He finds the range of value of life to vary by up to two orders of magnitude (a factor of 100).  Miller’s (1991) summary is reproduced below, with numbers updated to 1995 dollars.

High Uncertainty About Valuation

Costs Vary with Usage

Accounting, Difficult, but necessary to avoid double counting.

== Thought Question: Value of Life ==

Suppose there is a road improvement which will save 1 life per year, reducing the number of fatalities from 2 to 1 per year (out of 1000 people using the road). Assume all travelers are identical. What value of life should be used in the analysis?

Normally, we would do the equivalent of trying to compute for each traveler what is the willingness to pay for a 50% reduction in the chance of death by driving (from 2 in 1000 to 1 in 1000), and multiply that by the 1000 people whose chance of dying is reduced.

An alternative approach is to figure out the willingness to pay for the driver whose life is saved. So how much would you pay to avoid dying (with certainty) (i.e. what is your Willingness to Pay)? The answer to the first question is usually taken to be all of your resources (you would pay you everything so I won't kill you).

Alternatively how much can I pay you to allow you to let me kill you (Willingness to Accept)? The answer to this second question is: I would have to pay you an infinite amount of money in order for you to let me kill you.

Both of those sums of money (everything or infinity) likely exceed the willingness to pay to reduce the likelihood of dying with some probability, multiplied by the number of people experiencing it.

In economic terms, we are comparing the area under the demand curve (the consumer's surplus) for life (which has a value asymptotically approaching infinity as the amount of life approaches 0 (death approaches certainty) for a single individual, with the marginal change in the likelihood of survival multiplied by all individuals (i.e. the the quadrilateral between the y-axis of price and the same demand curve, between Pb and Pa) which describes the change in price for a change in survival).

On the one hand, using the marginal change for everyone rather than total change for the one person whose life is saved, we will give a lower value to safety improvements. On the other hand, the value of life to the individual himself is much higher than the value of life of that individual to society at large.

&lt;/div&gt;

      <comment>/* Linearity */ Added details about how the property is derived.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Linearity==
To be linear, &lt;math&gt;\hat{\beta}_1&lt;/math&gt; must be a linear function of &lt;math&gt;Y_i&lt;/math&gt;, as shown below

&lt;math&gt;\hat{\beta}_1 = \sum{k_i Y_i}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, at any given observation 'i'.

===Proof===
From the deviation-from-means form of the solution of the OLS Normal Equation for &lt;math&gt;\hat{\beta}_1&lt;/math&gt;, we have

&lt;math&gt;\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum{x_i y_i}}{\sum{x^{2}_i}} = \frac{\sum{x_i (Y_i - \bar{Y})}}{\sum{x_{i}^2}} = \frac{\sum{x_i Y_i}}{\sum{x_{i}^2}} - \frac{\sum{x_i \bar{Y}}}{\sum{x_{i}^2}} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; = \frac{\sum{x_i Y_i}}{\sum{x_{i}^2}} &lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;{\sum{x_i}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt; = \sum{k_i Y_i}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k_i = \frac{x_i}{\sum{x_i}}&lt;/math&gt;, which is a constant for any given 'i'-value.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are six component parts of DNA: Adenine(A), Guanine(G), Cytosine(C), Thymine(T), phosphate(backbone), and five carbon sugar(ribose). Using these components we can form a Double Stranded DNA molecule. 

As for pairing, A pairs with T forming two hydrogen bonds and G pairs with C forming three hydrogen bonds.

Considering that DNA is not the only Genetic molecule, we must also look at RNA. The other main difference between DNA and RNA, aside from DNA being double stranded and RNA being single stranded is that RNA and another nucleotide that replaces Thymine; this is called Uracil(U).

Genetics describes the inheritance from parents to offspring. An offspring will have the same characteristics such as phenotype and genotype from his parents.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Installing Python==

Python can be downloaded from the official Python website:

http://www.python.org/

If you are running Microsoft&amp;trade; Windows&amp;trade; then you can download a simple installation file from the downloads section of the official Python website and run that. If you are using a Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat etc.) you will most probably already have python installed.

==Running Python==

In Microsoft&amp;trade; Windows&amp;trade; you can run IDLE which is a piece of software called a development environment, by clicking on Start Menu, Python, IDLE. This is a program in which you can write and run Python programs.

In a Linux operating system such as Ubuntu, you can simply use Python in the Terminal. You can write a python program using GEdit and saving the file with the ending '.py', for example;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

As the protection afforded him at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]] will end when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] reaches maturity at age 17, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] elect to move him to an Order safe house. In order to confuse [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], who they believe has infiltrated the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]] is used to create six simulacra of Harry, each of whom sets off for a different safe house. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 4|Attacked]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]], the various groups battle their way to their various safe houses, eventually gathering at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]], where they make plans and grieve their losses.

== Event Details ==

Once [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Aunt Petunia]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] have left the house at Privet Drive, Harry, knowing that he is to be transported to a safe house before his protection runs out, finishes his preparations for departure. A noise in the back garden brings him downstairs, where he finds that many of the members of the Order have arrived, on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|broomsticks]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Thestral|Thestrals]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black's]] flying motorcycle. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]], the leader of the group, explains that Harry's house is being monitored by the Ministry, nominally to prevent anyone from arriving via [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparition]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkeys]], or [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|the Floo network]]. Moody is convinced that the Ministry has been infiltrated by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], and the monitoring is to determine if Harry is departing Privet Drive, and if so with whom and where, so they have chosen to travel by means that are not monitored. Additionally, there will be seven different Harry Potters traveling to seven different Order safe houses. Over Harry's protests, Moody produces a flask of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]] and demands some of Harry's hair. Eventually Harry gives in, and six of the wizards present, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred Weasley, George Weasley]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], drink the prepared potion, becoming Harry Potters. Each one is paired with a protector, and they leave the house.

Almost immediately they come under attack. Harry, with Hagrid, is initially attacked by four Death Eaters. A [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|killing curse]] aimed at Harry misses Harry by inches, killing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig]]. Hagrid uses gadgets that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] has built into the motorcycle to try to defend against the following Death Eaters, but it is only when the motorcycle spits dragon flame that the following Death Eaters are deterred. The dragon flame, however, pushes the motorcycle forwards, straining the connection between it and the sidecar, where Harry is sitting. A second attempt to use the dragon fire causes the sidecar to break off and start falling. Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wingardium Leviosa|Levitates]] the sidecar, but is unable to move it, and so hangs in the air while the three remaining Death Eaters attack. Hagrid manages to swing around and collect Harry out of the side car, but Harry loses everything except his rucksack. Harry, now hanging on to Hagrid's back, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Confringo|destroys]] the sidecar to disable a Death Eater, then notes that of the two left, one is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Stan Shunpike|Stan Shunpike]], clearly under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]]. Not wanting to injure Stan, Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|disarms]] him, whereupon the remaining Death Eater shouts &quot;It's the real one!&quot; and vanishes.

Harry doesn't trust the apparent breaking off of the action by the Death Eaters, so urges Hagrid to use the dragon-fire to speed them to their destination. They are surrounded by Death Eaters, however, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]. Harry feels his wand, on its own, twist and fire a bolt of golden flame, and hears Voldemort's scream of rage as his borrowed wand is destroyed. Hagrid leaps off the motorcycle to attack a Death Eater only feet away. As Harry desperately tries to brake the falling motorcycle, he hears Voldemort demanding a new wand from another Death Eater. Suddenly, all the Death Eaters vanish, and Harry falls into mud. He sees the fallen Hagrid, and crawls towards him, but blacks out.

Harry regains consciousness in the house of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ted Tonks|Ted Tonks]], one of the Order safe houses, where he learns that the reason for the Death Eaters vanishing was that they had run afoul of the Order's protective spells. After nearly jinxing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda Tonks]] under the impression that she is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]], Harry finds Hagrid unwounded, and together they are led to the hairbrush [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkey]] that will take them to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|the Burrow]].

At The Burrow, Harry and Hagrid are greeted by a worried [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]]; two other groups' Portkeys had arrived, but Harry's group is the first to actually get there.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]] now arrives with an injured George; his ear has been severed with the Dark [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sectumsempra|Sectumsempra]] curse by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]]. Now believing that someone in the group had betrayed them, Lupin tests Harry to see if he is who he appears. Reassured by Harry's response, he says that Voldemort probably homed in on Harry because of Harry's use of the disarmament charm. His use of it [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Cemetery Duel|against Voldemort in the cemetery]] had made the Death Eaters consider that something of a signature spell. Lupin urges Harry to use stronger spells in self defence, even if they do result in injury or death of those fighting on the side of the Death Eaters.

Next to arrive are [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kingsley Shacklebolt|Kingsley Shacklebolt]] with Hermione. Kingsley has apparently had the same thought as Lupin, because he immediately tests Lupin the same way that Lupin had tested Harry.

Next to arrive is Arthur Weasley, with Fred, one of the two groups originally scheduled to arrive before Harry. Arthur, frantic with worry, brushes aside the Order members who want to test his identity, to rush to George's side. George, to everyone's relief, regains consciousness and seems to be in good humour.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] and Ron, the other couple originally scheduled to arrive before Harry, now show up, explaining that they had been followed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Tonks' Aunt Bellatrix]], and had quite the battle with her. In the process, they had done some damage to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rodolphus Lestrange|Rodolphus Lestrange]].

Finally, after Shacklebolt has returned to the Muggle Prime Minister's office, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and Fleur arrive, saying that they had been delayed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Auntie Muriel|Auntie Muriel]]. The last pair, Alastor Moody with Mundungus Fletcher, will not be returning. The gathered Order members decide that Voldemort, finding so many Harry Potter simulacra, assumed the one defended by the strongest [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Auror]], Moody, was the real one. Fletcher, finding that he was Voldemort's direct target, had [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Disapparated]] out of the path of a curse, which had then hit Moody and apparently killed him. In his absence, the remaining Order members wonder if Mundungus was the traitor, but decide that he could not be; Voldemort had clearly not been expecting the multiplicity of Harry Potters, and that suggestion had come from Mundungus.

As Bill and Lupin depart to try to find Moody's body, Harry announces that his presence at The Burrow brings danger on everyone there, and says he has to leave as well. He is overruled by the Order members who say there is no way Voldemort could know which of several safe-houses he is in.

== Notable Consequences ==

Voldemort assumes that the most powerful [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Auror]] will be assigned to protect Harry, and so concentrates his efforts initially on Mad-Eye Moody's passenger, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]]. Mundungus, perceiving that he is catching most of the attacks, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Disapparates]], leaving Moody to catch the curse fired at Mundungus. This results in Moody's death.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/George Weasley|George Weasley]] losing an ear to a curse cast by Snape reinforces the Order's belief that Snape has become a Death Eater. It also may foreshadow another loss for the Weasley family.

The Ministry had been told that Harry would be moved on his birthday, but the actual escape had happened a few days earlier. The fact that Death Eaters were ready for the transfer indicates that there is a spy within the Order. The obvious candidate is the underworld element, Mundungus Fletcher; but he had originated a plan element that the Death Eaters were not prepared for, which indicates that it is someone else.

Lupin mentions that Harry's use of the Expelliarmus disarming charm has become a trademark of sorts. Lupin seems to indicate here that Harry is not ruthless enough for the battle he is facing; he certainly encourages Harry to use more destructive spells.

Harry, at the Burrow, is safe for the moment and can look forward to his own birthday and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur's]] wedding. However, he has seen the effort that the Death Eaters are willing to make to capture him, and fears for the safety of the people near him.

In the course of the escape, we get to meet Ted Tonks and Andromeda (Black) Tonks. Andromeda, like Sirius, had rebelled against her pure-blood heritage, but we see here that she looks like her sister Bellatrix.

Sirius' flying motorcycle is destroyed, though we will later learn that Arthur Weasley has recovered the pieces and is trying to reassemble it.

== Analysis ==

The fact that this battle happens quite early in the book, and is so lethal, is a clear indication that with this final book in the series we have entered a new and harsher phase of the epic. Until now, when Harry has faced Voldemort directly, it has been at the culmination of the year's adventures, so that we have been building up to the battle with Voldemort. This book, Voldemort makes himself known within the first few chapters. Apart from signaling to us that Harry's mission this year will be much harder, this also lets us know that Voldemort feels so secure in his power that he is willing to dogfight in the skies above Muggle England, where any Wizard or Muggle could see him and his followers.

One thing that we see mentioned in passing is that Voldemort is flying without a broomstick. We will perceive this again much later in the book when Harry is looking into his mind, and we will also see that Snape has evidently learned it as well. In the earlier part of the series, we were told that no Wizard can fly unassisted. This seems to reinforce our understanding that Voldemort is a wizard of rare power and inventiveness, as well as being evil.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

In what is quite possibly a deliberate parallel with the opening of the first story, Harry is carried out of danger to safety by Hagrid on Sirius' flying motorcycle. In an interview, the author had stated that Hagrid's fate was certain; as he had carried Harry out of the wreckage of his parents' house to Privet Drive, and from the Muggle world of the Dursleys to the Wizarding world behind the Leaky Cauldron, so would he carry Harry out of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] at the end of the story. Hagrid's carrying Harry at this point, though not mentioned by the author in that interview, is clearly another echo of that same pattern.

We will later learn that the plan to have multiple Harry Potters in the escape was a collaborative effort between Snape and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Paintings|portrait]] of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]. In order to stay in Voldemort's confidence, Snape would have to give him the true date of Harry's transfer, so the only way to avoid Harry being singled out and killed was to make a confusing multplicity of targets. Under instruction from Dumbledore, Snape had planted the idea in Mundungus' mind, and then hidden it from Voldemort in his own mind. Although this is never explicitly laid out, the fact that Snape had such easy access to Mundungus leads us to believe that Snape had extracted the information concerning the date of the transfer from Mundungus earlier.

Harry will later retrieve Moody's magical eye from inside the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. No other part of Moody will ever be found, leaving the possibility that he had escaped just ever so slightly open.

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Having determined that a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] is in the hands of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] decide to enter the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] in an attempt to determine where it is being kept. They assume the guise of three Ministry workers and enter as part of the morning arrivals. The three of them are separated, with Hermione ending up in one of the courtrooms acting as scribe for proceedings that Umbridge is chairing. When Harry joins her there, Hermione happens to notice that Umbridge is wearing the locket bearing the Horcrux. Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stuns]] Umbridge and the other Ministry worker there present, Hermione gets the locket away from Umbridge, leaving a replica, and they escape, luckily joining up with Ron. A [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]] is unfortunately dragged along with them by side-along [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparition]] as they attempt to return to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]], and while Hermione is able to force him to let go, he is then on the doorstep of Grimmauld Place. Believing that Grimmauld Place is no longer a safe sanctuary, Hermione Apparates the Trio again, this time to a spot in a forest.

== Event Details ==

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], at the end of the previous year, had retrieved what they thought was a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] from a cave by the sea, only to find out that one ''R. A. B.'' had beaten them to it, replacing the Horcrux, which we learn was a locket, with a locket of his own. Finding that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]]' brother, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Regulus Black|Regulus]], has the same initials, Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] search Regulus' room. The search is fruitless, but Hermione recalls seeing a locket when cleaning up [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]] earlier. Summoned by Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]] admits to having taken the locket, but says that it had later been stolen by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]]. Kreacher is then sent to fetch Mundungus, and returns with him after a few days. Under coercion, Mundungus reports that the locket had been extorted from him, in turn, by a witch that Harry recognizes, from Mundungus' description, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]].

Harry, Hermione, and Ron decide to enter the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], illegally and undercover, in an attempt to find where the real locket is. After several weeks of observation and planning, they waylay and knock out three Ministry employees and use some of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]]'s stock of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]] to impersonate them: Hermione as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mafalda Hopkirk|Mafalda Hopkirk]], Ron as one Reg Cattermole, a maintenance worker, and Harry as a tall wizard whose name he does not know. With magical tokens that they have seen other Ministry workers using, they enter a specific set of public washrooms, and flush themselves into the Ministry.

On arriving at the Atrium, Harry is mildly disgusted to realize that the Fountain of Magical Brethren has been replaced by a sculpture of an apparent Wizarding family seated upon thrones made out of tormented human figures, apparently meant to represent [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggles]]. As the disguised Trio line up for the elevators, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Yaxley|Yaxley]] approaches and tells Ron that it is raining in his office, and that he should fix it. He also makes a threat about Cattermole's wife, who is appearing before the Muggle-born Registration Commission that day. Yaxley then strides off to a lift that is headed downwards. Ron rides upwards to Yaxley's office on Level Two, and with Hermione's whispered advice still in his ears, heads off to try and stop the rain. Harry and Hermione, reaching Level One, are confronted by Minster for Magic [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pius Thicknesse|Pius Thicknesse]], and Dolores Umbridge.

Umbridge immediately assumes that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Travers|Travers]] had sent Mafalda to be her recorder at the day's session of the Muggle-Born Registration Commission, and, taking the disguised Hermione with her, descends, leaving Harry and the Minister. The Minister, addressing Harry as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albert Runcorn|&quot;Albert&quot;]], seems to accept Harry's explanation for being on the first level, and leaves him. Harry now dons his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], and starts searching for Umbridge's office. He finds an open area with pink pages flying about, and a number of witches and wizards who are assembling the pages into pamphlets. Examining an assembled pamphlet under his Cloak, he sees that it is anti-Muggle propaganda. Hearing a rude comment about the wizards' boss, he looks towards the indicated office door and sees [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Moody]]'s magical eye fixedly staring at the ceiling, and a nameplate that reads &quot;''Dolores Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister''&quot;. The Invisibility Cloak will not allow him to open a door undetected, so Harry arms a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Decoy Detonator|Decoy Detonator]]. When it goes off with a great cloud of smoke at the far end of the room, Harry opens the door and enters Umbridge's office.

Once inside, he finds a small telescope fixed to the inside of the door; peering through it, he sees the pamphleteering witches and wizards looking at the Decoy Detonator. Harry wrenches the telescope out of the door, and pockets Moody's eye. He then tries to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Accio|Summon]] the locket, without success.

Searching Umbridge's office, he finds a file on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]], who is listed as a pure-blood, but is likely to be contacted by &quot;Undesirable Number One&quot;, Harry himself. Arthur is also being Tracked. The search is otherwise fruitless, but taking one last look around the office, Harry sees [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] looking at him from a small mirror. Upon closer inspection, the mirror turns out to be the cover of a book: ''The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore'' by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]]. Flipping it open, he sees a picture of two teenagers, but before he can read the caption, the office door opens. Pius Thicknesse enters and writes a note to Umbridge; Harry leaves, passing the pamphlet witches still investigating the Decoy Detonator, and returns to the lift. He must now find Ron, get down to the courtrooms, and collect Hermione; it seems unlikely the locket is here. Luckily, as the lift reaches the second floor, Ron steps on; before they can exchange more than greetings, though, the lift stops again and Arthur Weasley and a blonde witch get on, deep in conversation. Arthur gives Harry a distasteful look, but tells Ron about a spell that might work on Yaxley's office. On the next floor, Ron and the blonde witch get off, but blocked by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy Weasley]] getting on, Harry is unable to follow. Percy looks up from his reading and suddenly realizes his father is there, and gets out on the next floor. Harry again tries to follow, but is blocked by Arthur, who accuses him of planting information about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dirk Cresswell|Dirk Cresswell]]. When Harry tells Arthur that he is being Tracked, Arthur considers it a threat. Arthur exits on the Atrium level, and Harry puts the Invisibility Cloak back on. He will have to extricate Hermione while Ron is stopping the rain in Yaxley's office.

Heading to the courtrooms, Harry recognizes the unnatural chill caused by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]]; the creatures are guarding Muggle-born witches and wizards waiting outside the courtroom. A wizard is led from the courtrooms by two Dementors. Mary Cattermole is then called in by Umbridge, and Harry follows her. Inside, two Dementors are held at bay by a cat [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]], and Umbridge, Hermione (as Mafalda), and Yaxley are examining Cattermole, demanding to know whose wand she stole. As Umbridge leans forward, the Locket around her neck swings out. Hermione takes a chance and asks about it; Umbridge claims the S initial is for Selwyn, a very old Wizarding family she is honoured to be related to. This is too much for Harry, who immediately [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stuns]] Umbridge and Yaxley. Prompted by Hermione, Harry casts a Patronus, just in time to save Mary Cattermole. He [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Diffindo|tries and fails]] to release the chains on Mary, while Hermione [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Geminio|creates a duplicate]] Locket to replace the real one; finally Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Relashio|succeeds]] in releasing Mary. Escorted by Harry and Hermione's Patronuses, the three leave the courtrooms. Gathering the other Muggle-borns, Harry says the new official position is to disguise themselves and leave the country if possible, at the very least stay away from the Ministry; they can leave from the Atrium.

Arriving at the lifts, they are met by Ron; Mary Cattermole runs to hug him, thinking he is her husband, Reg. Ron warns Harry and Hermione that the Ministry knows they are there and work crews are closing off the fireplaces. Harry says they can still get out if they hurry. At the Atrium, Harry orders the crews to stop sealing fireplaces. When one wizard protests. Harry threateningly asks if he wants his family tree examined the way Dirk Cresswell's was. Muggle-borns are sent in pairs through the remaining fireplaces, but the real Reg Cattermole appears from the lifts. Amidst his and Mary Cattermole's confusion, Yaxley appears, demanding that the fireplaces be sealed. Harry points to the wizard who questioned him, saying he was allowing Muggle-borns to escape. As the commotion builds, Ron and Mary Cattermole escape; as the truth dawns on Yaxley, he fires a curse at Harry exiting through the fireplace with Hermione. Arriving in the bathroom, Harry sees Yaxley appear in the cubicle behind him. Grabbing Hermione and Ron, Harry Disapparates. He briefly sees the door of Grimmauld Place, then there is a bang and they are Apparating away.

Ron has been Splinched and is losing blood; Hermione tells Harry to fetch [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dittany|Dittany]] from her beaded bag, and uses that to start him healing. Hermione explains that Yaxley had held on to her arm as they Apparated to Grimmauld Place. She had jinxed him to force him to let go, but because she had brought him to Grimmauld Place, and she is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Fidelius|Secret-Keeper]] since the death of Dumbledore, it was possible that he now knew how to get in. As the house was no longer safe, she had Apparated them away to a forest where she and her family had gone camping once. Harry sets up the tent, and Hermione sets protective spells. They move into the tent to plan and recuperate. Ron requests that they not use [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s name; Harry and Hermione agree to this.

The following morning, Harry gets up before the others, and buries Moody's eye beneath a nearby tree.

== Notable Consequences ==

The primary consequence is the recovery of the Locket Horcrux. This is the third of six Horcruxes that we know about; we have seen the diary and the ring, and believe the others are Hufflepuff's cup, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]], and another, as yet undetermined, artifact of the Founders. We don't yet know how to destroy it, but possession of the Locket is clearly a necessary first step.

Our view and Harry's of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] illuminate the control [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] has taken of Wizarding England. The replacement of the previously-destroyed Fountain of Magical Brethren with a statue of a Wizarding family seated on thrones made of Muggles in torment quite clearly indicates that the Ministry has embraced Voldemort's views on wizarding superiority. The wizard who approaches Harry in the elevator talking about the recently-denounced head of the Goblin Liaison Office quite clearly shows the viciousness of the current administration. The propaganda unit that Harry finds just outside Umbridge's office also shows the extent to which the Ministry now depends on fear, uncertainty, and doubt to maintain its grip on power.

From perusing Umbridge's files, Harry learns that he is now &quot;Undesirable Number One&quot;, and that there is a watch on Arthur Weasley in case Harry tries to contact him. This may prevent Harry later trying to contact Arthur.

Also in Umbridge's office, Harry sees a copy of Rita Skeeter's book about Dumbledore. It is one of the pictures in this book that will give him a clue as to the identity of the fair-haired thief who stole the as yet unknown object from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregorovitch|Gregorovitch]]. 

The recovery of Mad-Eye Moody's magical eye, and its subsequent burial, gives Harry necessary closure regarding Moody and his death.

Harry, as Albert Runcorn, manages to engineer the escape of many of the Muggle-born witches and wizards currently awaiting examination by the Muggle-born Registration Commission. While we do not learn their eventual fate, they at least have a chance, which they did not have before.

In deference to Ron's feelings, Harry and Hermione agree to not use Voldemort's name. This will remain in force for several months; apparently, Hermione and Harry make a habit of using the standard expressions &quot;You-know-who&quot; and &quot;He who must not be named&quot; instead of Voldemort's name, and this habit becomes unconscious.

The Death Eater Yaxley is accidentally Apparated to the doorstep of Number 12, Grimmauld Place. Hermione believes that, having been brought to the house, Yaxley can now let other Death Eaters into the house. The breaking of the secrecy around Grimmauld Place will result in Harry, Ron, and Hermione moving from place to place around the English countryside for the remainder of the year. The loss of the comforts they had come to expect in Grimmauld Place may well put a serious strain on the Trio's relationship; it is likely that Ron, who has been surrounded by a loving household his entire life, will be more affected by the loss of the creature comforts he has come to expect, while Harry, who lived with the Dursleys, and Hermione, who has had at least some prior camping experience, will be better able to deal with the privations of an itinerant lifestyle.

== Analysis ==

For something that has taken so long to plan, it is amazing how quickly this mission falls apart. It should have occurred to one of the three that the workers they were impersonating would have work to do, and could well get hauled off to do that work; it is almost inevitable that they will be separated once they enter the Ministry, and of course they are. They are also almost unprepared for being confronted; Cattermole, for instance, is a maintenance worker, yet Ron is utterly unprepared to do maintenance. One must also wonder what they hoped to accomplish; the locket that they hoped to find information about, being a personal adornment, is unlikely to be in Umbridge's office, so it is uncertain what Harry hoped to find there. The only reason that the plan did not founder immediately was due to extreme good fortune; Umbridge happened to be actually wearing the locket, and revealed it to Harry and Hermione, and Harry was able to Stun her in order to retrieve it. It also helped greatly that Harry, in his disguise as Albert Runcorn, was evidently quite high in the councils of the Ministry.

This failure of planning seems to point up the lack of maturity of our three heroes. They have concocted a flawless, if perhaps overcomplicated, plan to enter the Ministry, and succeed in carrying it off, but having accomplished that step, it seems that the rest of the effort is more than they are prepared for.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Harry does not yet recognize the the two teenage wizards in the picture in Rita's book. He will eventually find out that one of them is Dumbledore, the other being the thief who had stolen the object from Gregorovitch, and will later find out that he is actually [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Gellert Grindelwald]]. He will also become aware that Voldemort is following the same logical path, looking for the object that was stolen from Gregorovitch.

The loss of Grimmauld Place will be one of Hermione's few mistakes. We have learned earlier that with the death of Dumbledore, everyone who was privy to the secret of Grimmauld Place became a Secret-Keeper, able to reveal the secret at will. It is certainly possible that Yaxley, having been shown the doorstep of Grimmauld Place by Hermione, now a Secret-Keeper for the location, will be aware of it; however, as he is not a Secret-Keeper himself, he cannot reveal it to anyone else. We know that Snape was aware of the location of Headquarters, and so would be able to reveal it at will to Death Eaters; in fact, the presence of Death Eaters on the doorstep of Grimmauld Place, but unable to see or enter the building, is evidence of Snape's true loyalty. If, as Harry and we believe at this point, Snape is entirely a Death Eater, Yaxley's becoming aware of Grimmauld Place is only a slight increase in its insecurity. The only reason for the Trio to abandon Grimmauld Place at this point is a belief that Snape is somehow unable to reveal the presence of Grimmauld Place, and so Yaxley, aware of the place, represents a threat by himself. It was mentioned that Moody had set some enchantments on Grimmauld Place with the intent of preventing Snape's mentioning it to anyone else, but while there is an implication that he does not quite trust his jinxes, the Trio don't seem to share it, and remain at Grimmauld Place for a month despite the watching Death Eaters. While the judgement that Snape will not lead Death Eaters into Grimmauld Place is valid, given Snape's actual loyalty, neither we nor the Trio have discovered that, and so the decision to abandon Grimmauld Place seems ill-advised given the very slight increase in risk.

The privations of the life of camping will actually cause Ron to leave the group. While he will think better of it almost immediately, and will try to return, he will run into difficulties that will prevent his return until Harry and Hermione have moved on. This enforced separation will show us two things. First, we will learn immediately the depth of Hermione's feelings for Ron. At their new camp site, once it becomes inevitable that Ron will be unable to find them, Hermione will simply sit on a rock crying, leaving Harry to work the protective spells.

The second, apparently unrelated, thing that we will learn is that objects can be made to react to mention of their owners' name. In particular: Ron had received a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deluminator|Deluminator]] in Dumbledore's will, and the Deluminator started relaying Harry and Hermione's conversation to Ron once Hermione used his name. The Deluminator also was then able to transport Ron to Harry and Hermione.

This sensitivity to names is a very broad hint, which is shortly confirmed by Ron: Voldemort has either enchanted his name, or enchanted devices to respond to it, such that any use of Voldemort's name results in immediate attention from Death Eaters or their associates (&quot;''snatchers''&quot;). It is the use of Voldemort's name in the Tottenham Court Road café that had brought the two Death Eaters to them, before the Trio had gone to Grimmauld Place.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Background==

The foundations of biochemistry can be broken down into cellular foundation, chemical foundation, physical foundation, genetic foundation, and evolutionary foundation. The foundation of biochemistry can be described as a study relating the structure to the properties of biological [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Types of Macromolecules|macromolecules]], as well as understand the function.

Biological foundations can be described as the study of the structures, the properties, and the reactions of biological macromolecules, such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]] and [[Structural Biochemistry/Carbohydrates|carbohydrates]] on a cellular, chemical or physical level. By understanding the structure of these macromolecules, often the properties will be more apparent and the function can be understood. It can also be described in terms of genetics, such as the basis of genetics as the study of the structure of [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]],[[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA|RNA]], and [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]] sequences and how their structure helps to define and give understanding to how they work.

Biological foundations can also be described on an evolutionary basis such as the three domains of life ([[Structural Biochemistry/Three Domains of Life/Archaea|Archaea]],[[Structural Biochemistry/Three Domains of Life/Bacteria|Bacteria]], and [[Structural Biochemistry/Three Domains of Life/Eukarya|Eukarya]]).

The biological basis of structural biochemistry focuses mainly around evolutionary, genetic, and cellular foundations.

== Distinguishing Properties of Living Organisms ==
Living organisms are complex and organized systems composed of many cells. These cells may be highly specialized for different functions. In turn, these cells are composed of sub cellular structures which are then composed of [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Types of Macromolecules|macromolecules]]. These macromolecules are the cellular machinery that allow a cell to complete its tasks. 

=== Anatomical Structure Complements Function ===
Each part of an organism serves a purpose. Each organelle is structured in a way so that it may compensate changes in its environment and allow for many processes to occur. In the microscopic world,  molecules are structured so they can serve functional tasks, such as e[[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzymes]], hormones, or [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]]. In Biology, it is important to relate the structures and organizations to the functional roles they serve in the organism.

=== Systems and Energy Transformation ===
In order to maintain, build, and live, organisms must extract and transform energy from their environments. This energy, which may be extracted from the sun or from food, allows an organism to do mechanical, chemical, osmotic and electrical work to maintain its highly organized structures. In other words, energy and material are used to maintain stability of the organism, a process known as homeostasis.

=== Self Replication ===
Throughout time, organisms reproduce to give nearly identical copies. The most complex molecules are replicated with great accuracy. The genetic material which is responsible for this is deoxyribonucleic acid, or [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]]. This accuracy still has some probability of error and gives rise to evolutionary change. Because of environments which may harm the organism, organisms adapt and may change their structure to accommodate survival.

=== Capacity for evolutionary change ===
An organism has to have a history of evolutionary change. An evolution tree displays the pathways where organisms may have gone through divergent of convergent evolution.

=== Respond to stimuli ===
An organism has to be able to perceive the environment through their senses. They need to be able to respond and adapt to the changes in the environment.

== ''Reader-Centered Approach'' ==

Résumés and cover letters are the two most common types of documents written in the business world that show off a candidates related work experiences, skills, and qualifications. When writing either of these documents, the reader-centered approach is very useful because it keeps the reader and what the reader is looking for in mind at all times.  A writer using the reader-centered approach must constantly think about these three elements:

*The reader's characteristics, goals, expectations, situation, and any other factors that will shape their response to what is said
*The creation of a usable and persuasive communication to the reader
*A focus on how the reader will respond moment by moment while reading the document

It is very important to adopt the reader-centered approach and focus on what the reader wants and why.  They are the ones who will be offering the position, so these career documents need to be tailored to their liking.  

One characteristic about the document that favors the reader is usability. The reader needs to be able to navigate the document quickly and with little effort, understand the needed information easily, and get a sense of who ''you'' are. 

The document also needs to be persuasive. A résumé and cover letter need to persuade the reader and show that you are the best candidate for the job. By grabbing their attention and showing them in the most attractive and persuasive way will help you to stand out in their minds and get you closer to the job.

When writing either a résumé or cover letter, the reader must always be in mind because they are the ones you want to impress.

== ''Reader-Centered Approach to Writing a Résumé'' ==

When writing a résumé, you must always keep in mind what the employer is looking for in a prospective employee, and the easiest way to accomplish this is by thinking about your readers.  Try to answer these questions:

*What will they be looking for?
**How will they look for this information?
*How will they use it when they find it?
**What are their attitudes about the subject?
*What do you want their attitudes and thoughts to be when they have finished reading it?

In order to use the reader-centered approach, you must know who your reader is. Use resources such as current employees, websites, newspapers, magazines and books to learn more information about the company in which you are applying to. This is a very important step in writing a résumé, and doing research on your reader will only aid you in writing one that is more reader-centered. This will also prepare you for a potential interview. You always want to know about the company you are applying for so if any questions or opinions are asked you have the necessary knowledge to answer them correctly.

Once you identify who you are writing to, it is time to determine what qualifications the reader is looking for. Qualifications usually include technical expertise, supporting abilities, and favorable job qualities. You may find out what qualifications are necessary for the job by talking with someone who holds that particular job title.  Make lists to brainstorm possible contents of your résumé. List your accomplishments, areas of knowledge, and related work experiences.  After talking to someone who holds the position you are applying for, you can then return to your lists and find the items that best fit the position.   

Your résumé is a document designed to persuade an employer that you possess the necessary job skills to work at the organization, and you want to provide plenty of examples that show you are the best candidate for the job. Promote &quot;YOU&quot;!

== ''Reader-Centered Approach to Writing a Cover Letter '' == 

A cover letter is an important career document because it allows you to go further into detail about your related work experiences and why you want to work for that specific company. If an employer is reading your cover letter, it means that the reader found your résumé usable and persuasive. It also shows that they found you to be a qualified candidate and want to know more about what you can do for them. It is important to write with a reader-centered approach and to make your cover letter even more usable and persuasive than your résumé. The usability of the cover letter should be based off of the following questions:

*Why do you want to work for me instead of someone else?
**How will you contribute to my organization's success?
*Will you work well with my other employees and the persons with whom we do business?

The persuasive objectives of your cover letter should respond to the employer's questions listed above in ways that make the employer want to hire you. Your cover letter should show enthusiasm, creativity, commitment, and other characteristics that employers value but cannot be communicated easily in your résumé. 

A cover letter is a persuasive letter that is achieved by grabbing the reader's attention. Cover letters should state why an applicant wants to work for an employer and address how the applicant will contribute to the success of the organization. The applicant should answer this question in the cover letter: &quot;What am I able to do for this employer or organization?&quot; This is the time to tell the employer how you stand out compared to others seeking that position. You should also show that you have knowledge about the company or position you are applying to show that you are already interested and committed to the mission statement.

A cover letter will project your personality to the organization that you are applying to. The tone of your letter is important as it indicates your personality. If you know the kind of people that the organization employs, it will help you to set the tone for your cover letter. While some employers want to hire enthusiastic, hard-working employees, other employers may look specifically for critical, confident, or good-tempered employees. How well you know your reader is critical to writing a cover letter with a reader-centered approach.

== ''Other Things to Keep in Mind'' ==

*As always, with professional writing, you should be concise. Be careful to avoid &quot;wordiness&quot; and &quot;extra fluff&quot;
*Address a specific person with your cover letter
*The first paragraph of your cover letter should show your interest in the position, your familiarity of it, and the company
*Put qualifications in the second or third paragraph of the cover letter
*Only list university education on your résumé unless aspects of high school are exceptional 
*Include city and state for schools, companies, and organizations on your résumé
*On your résumé, begin every bullet point with an action verb

==Résumés==

[[Professional and Technical Writing/Career/Resumes|This section]] explains in greater detail what résumés are, different types of résumés, and how to create your résumé.

==Cover Letters==

[[Professional and Technical Writing/Career/Cover Letters|This section]] discusses the functions of a cover letter and how to create one.

* The letters Cc, Qq, Vv, Ww, Yy are generally only used in foreign words in batua, but they may be used more frequently in the dialects, either as non-standard spellings or to denote phonemes that do not exist in batua. In addition, the letter ç may be used, especially in archaic spellings or in foreign words.
* The Zuberoan (Souletin) dialect also makes use of the letter ''ü'', which represents the French ''u'' or the German ''ü'', a sound that doesn't occur in the other dialects nor in batua.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Basque is an ancient language spoken in the Basque country (Spain) and Northern Basque Country (France).  It is spoken as a first language by more than 1 million people.

Unlike all other languages in Europe Basque is an isolated language meaning that it is not related to any other language in the world.  Because of the uniqueness of Basque it can be difficult for people to learn as a second language.

Hi there. You've already stated that you know there is already a [[Japanese|Japanese wikibook]] so I don't have to inform you about that, but I think you should know that there are already plans (and a lot of progress!) for improving the Japanese wikibook. [[User:lastguru|lastguru]] and a few others are creating an [[Japanese:New Lesson Thread|entirely new set of lessons]]. I would recommend you take a look at this and see if you can contribute there. 

When these new lessons are complete (or nearly complete), they will replace the old lessons and the old lessons will be moved to appendices until it is deemed that they are no longer needed (ie, their content has been integrated into the new lessons). Also, we are going to split up the lessons and reference information into different sections to make the book much more useful and easier to foloow. If you are interested, you should sign up to the japanese-wiki mailing list (there are instructions on the [[Japanese/Discussion|Japanese discussion page]].

Finally, I should point out that this book is probably in violation of wikibook policy because it has the same topic, goals and audience as an existing wikibook. I hope you'll think about helping out with the exising Japanese wikibook, because the entire structure of the Japanese wikibook *is* changing.

: &amp;mdash; [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 02:08, 13 September 2005 (UTC)
----

==Good start, but...==

There's some real fundamental issues here.  First of all, the basic course introduces text right off the bat without introducing syllabaries so the learner can learn to read said text.

The book is also geared towards speaking, and yet, having used a similar system and then gone to Japan myself, it's not useful to teach anything besides words and grammar.  It is impossible to start a conversation by talking about the weather unless you have something to follow it up with.

I also would take issue with the romanization system that is proposed (the ''hougen'' page for example).  Using the so-called &quot;Japanese educational&quot; system is rather useless, as no English-language textbooks (and therefore no English speaking learners) are ever going to use it, because it looks odd to English speakers to render ''shi'' as ''si'', etc.  Also, nine times out of ten, the Japanese will shorten long vowels or introduce an h (''Ôno'' becomes '''Ono''' or '''Ohno'''), not use the &quot;email romaji system&quot; of spelling out long vowels in romanization.  This is also 9 times out of 10 out of the 1 time out of a hundred they would actually need to romanize at all. 

Also, on the Japanese Wiki, furigana are generally not used, simply because they are too small to read (which is evident here), and I would suggest not using them, especially in the beginner's section.  Anyone who can read them likely doesn't need a beginner's course anyway. 

So I think some of the structure needs http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Japanese&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1to be reworked in order for this book to do what it is supposed to. [[User:MSJapan|MSJapan]] 18:33, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

:I agree entirely. I think the book should start with an introduction to cultural and general linguistic information rather than simply throwing readers into a lesson (or rather a messy menu). Then talk about pronunciation and introduce the kana, and so forth. Take a look at the [[Chinese]] Wikibook for ideas.
:On a sidenote, I'll point out that ''some'' Japanese textbooks do use that romanization system (''Beginning Japanese'' by Eleanor Harz Jorden and Hamako Ito Chaplin, for example), but I agree that it's not common or useful enough to warrant using it here. I suggest the more common modified Hepburn system, which uses the expected ''shi'' and such, with macrons for long vowels (or you could double them) and an apostrophe after any syllabic ''n'' (ん) that precedes a vowel. --[[User:WurdBendur|WurdBendur]] 02:41, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

:If a person were to try and learn Japanese from this site, they would give up shortly after trying to navigate through it.  A lot of things were merged haphazardly and it's rather difficult to learn much at all.  Some things are stated twice and some pages are vastly different from 'group' pages (like the vocabulary pages.)   It's a discombobulating mess that needs to be heavily edited. I agree about the Furigana, but the modified hepburn system should be very useful as long as the kana is used. [[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] 06:27, 13 August 2006 (UTC)



== Change the approach! ==

You can't teach Japanese to a novice learner by continually referring to different writing scripts, kana, kanji, grammatical jargon, and especially the plain form. 

To write a Japanese textbook, you need to lay down the basics in the です／ます form and ONLY then do you teach plain form structure to assist with grammatical patterns, and the only do you give them enough know-how to converse and write in both styles of the language.

== Romaji is a crutch. ==

Both [[Japanese]] and [[Japanese/Guide]] are excellent and noble beginnings to Japanese learning wikibooks.  However, the kana is a '''crucial''' first step in learning the language.  People that start learning Japanese with romaji typically have a horribly hard time giving it up.  I am completely self-taught, and after speaking to several Japanese teachers, and my brother (14 years of immersive Japanese, and basically fluent), I made the plunge by learning the kana first.  I have several friends that speak (some) Japanese as well, and those that started with romaji end up still using it, even years later, to &quot;write&quot; Japanese things out.  One learned this way in college, and another in the U.S. military, and both constantly fall back on it.  In order for people that want to use these guides to start learning Japanese, the site should offer a kana version, and encourage the kana to be the first step in learning.  

If people have a hard time learning the kana based on the lessons on this site, there is a (relatively) inexpensive alternative.  I cannot say enough good things about the book &quot;Remembering the Kana&quot; by James Heisig (ISBN 4889960724 -- a mere US$10.17 at amazon.com).  I literally learned '''all''' the kana in a single weekend, and my retention is near perfect, even when reading quickly.  Mr. Heisig's method and execution in this book is incredible, and I use his &quot;Remembering the Kanji&quot; series as well to supplement my kanji learning.

'''To all prospective Japanese students... KANA IS CRUCIAL!  Learn it ASAP, and you will thank yourself later!'''  Depending on who you ask, some people seem to think that you can get by in Japan on just romaji, based on the large amount of roman text/english seen everywhere.  However, while you may be able to find the resturaunt with it's nice &quot;english&quot; sign, good luck finding a menu that you can read.  Nearly every western influenced place has the menu written nearly entirely in katakana.  Interestingly enough, many Japanese struggle with romaji, and have to sound things out and then figure out what they are supposed to mean.  For example, when attempting to find my hotel on my last trip, the guidebook had the name and address written in english.  The taxi driver was lost trying to figure out what the address was, but I quickly wrote it down in kana for him, and he caught on immediately (for those wondering why I didn't just say it to him, addresses in Tokyo, where most streets are unnamed, are completely insane and complicated... it was easier to just write it down and hand it to him).

I think the first couple of lessons in japanese should have both romaji and kana. Then by the 3rd or 4th chapter stop using romaji. It will give learners a chance to learn vocabulary words they can try to spell out with hiragana and katakana and make them feel like they are still learning japanese until they get to the point where they can read vocab lists and such without romaji. Once people get a taste for how easy basic japanese grammar is, they will want to learn the writting system. 

Also, I was thinking maybe we should make a workbook to go with the text book. That way there are assignments people can use to practice what they learn in each chapter.

:I agree 100%. Getting to used to romaji is really bad for ones studies. Personally, I used romaji a lot when I learned at home, then I moved to Japan (where I'm currently living) and since then I've never used romaji outside of internet conversations with friends who can't read kana. Romaji is just.. useless, and can even confuse things. - ([[User:Tobberoth|Tobberoth]] 17:18, 5 April 2007 (UTC))

: Agree likewise. This textbook is a farce while using roomaji. [[User:24.60.58.198|24.60.58.198]] 00:49, 29 May 2007 (UTC)

::I totally DISagree! I know several people who can speak Japanese FLUENTLY, but can't read a single kana or kanji. It is very well possible to learn Japanese in roomaji, lots of Japanese course books are written in roomaji only! Moreover, people should make their own choice HOW to learn Japanese. We should NOT force them to study a complicated writing system if they don't want to. I do agree it is much more helpful to also learn the writing system, esp. if you ever want to live in Japan, but it is not up to us or to anybody else for them to decide whether or not they should learn it.
::I think it's best to make the courses in kanji/kana AND in roomaji. Everybody can then decide for themselves to go the 'easy' way or the 'hard' way.

:::If the goal of this book is ''verbal fluency'', then you are absolutely right in saying that the use of romaji does not matter. However, if the goal is ''fluency in all aspects of Japanese'', then I must disagree in saying romaji is okay. You even said, &quot;I know several people who can ''speak'' Japanese FLUENTLY&quot;, so if literacy is not a reader's top priority, it is fine. We could include both  romaji and kana/kanji by hiding romaji inside a collapsible div.--[[User:Balloonguy|Balloonguy]] 23:35, 13 November 2007 (UTC)
::::A collapsible div? That sounds like a good idea. But I am also afraid that contributers will find it difficult to use a div like that. I must say that even I don't know how to do it and I have been around on Wikipedia/Wikibooks (esp. first) for a while now. Moreover, who is going to build in all those divs on the existing pages now? I haven't even got enough time to work on the Japanese itself, though my hands are itchy. ;-) ''Ja ne!''

==PDF and Printable Versions==
I'd like to see pdf versions of this book and printable versions of this book, as they have done in the Chinese wikibook.  Are there plans for this?
: I wouldn't recommend a PDF version of the book until it's heavily cleaned up.  There's no one wanting to take the reins and the last 'drastic' change ended up being stalemated as no one continued or really agreed upon propsed changes. [[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] 09:12, 6 May 2007 (UTC)

== Development? ==

Is there any active development taking place? I want to make sure before I start working on this.--[[User:Balloonguy|Balloonguy]] 15:56, 1 September 2007 (UTC)
: Go for it.  The book is already pretty much fragmented and the yahoo group is pretty much dead. ;) [[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] 05:13, 3 September 2007 (UTC)
:: I would love for this book to be developed, and being a total newbie to the whole wikibooks project thing, i might just like to edit this page every so often as a learning tool for me, and for my friends who are studying japanese. given my limited knowledge about wikibooks, this will be a slow process :)

== Plan ==

I have sort of made a plan concerning the japanese wikibook [[User:Balloonguy/Japanese|here]]. Please give me your comments, changes that need to be made, etc.--

:[[Japanese/Lessons/Introduction/Ii tenki desu ne/Special kana rules|Special kana rules]] should probably be deleted. All of that is already explained before hand in the kana lessons i think. 

:Also I think everything on the [[Japanese/Introduction]] page should be moved onto the [[Japanese/Contents]] page. There is not really a need for such a small page, all of the information can be laid out at the top of the contents under an introduction heading. [[User:Ikarsik|Ikarsik]] 00:02, 4 November 2007 (UTC)

:Commented out link to introduction from this page. Intro is still linked from the getting started heading on contents page, but I moved all the links on introduction page under getting started heading. [[User:Ikarsik|Ikarsik]] 00:22, 4 November 2007 (UTC)
::I agree with all your changes.--[[User:Balloonguy|Balloonguy]] 13:57, 4 November 2007 (UTC)

== Deleting orphans ==

I've found a number of orphans which seem to be remnants of the past, not to be redeemed. How do people feel about deleting these:
# [[Japanese/Lessons/Introduction/Konnichiwa/Parts]]
# [[Japanese/Lessons/Introduction/Wakarimasu yo/Parts]]
# [[Japanese/Grammar Lessons/Introduction/Navbar]]
# [[Japanese/Grammar Lessons/Navbar]]
# [[Japanese/Lessons/Introduction/Ii tenki desu ne/Navbar]]
# [[Japanese/Lessons/Introduction/Konnichiwa/Navbar]]
# [[Japanese/Lessons/Introduction/Konnichiwa/Noun predicates/Navbar]]
# [[Japanese/Lessons/Introduction/Navbar]]
# [[Japanese/Lessons/Introduction/Ogenki desu ka/Navbar]]
# [[Japanese/Lessons/Introduction/Wakarimasu yo/Affirmative and negative forms/Navbar]]
# [[Japanese/Lessons/Introduction/Wakarimasu yo/Navbar]]
# [[Japanese/Lessons/Navbar]]
# [[Japanese/Lessons/Introduction/Amari muzukashikunai desu/Navbar]]
# [[Japanese/Lessons/Introduction/Konnichiwa/Printable version]]
# [[Japanese/Lessons/Introduction/Ogenki desu ka/Printable version]]

They were all created in 2006. The &quot;Introduction/*/Navbar&quot; pages were modified in February 2008 by [[User:Neoptolemus]] to link to the &quot;Lesson n&quot; form, but they still partly link to the old pages. None of these is linked to anywhere but [[User:Hagindaz/Orphans]] and [[User:Everlong/Orphans]].

As none of these has any meaningful content (navigation aids that point to two seperate sets of pages, printable versions of incomplete pages that aren't used any more) they all fit the criteria for speedy deletion. Just wanted to quickly check here first, though. Maybe someone interested in the printables? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 13:31, 10 June 2008 (UTC)

: I vote for '''deleting''' the whole lot.  As you noticed, a lot of them are broken anyways by previous moves, merges, or whatever else.  Add the printable versions once a solid version is accomplished.  A navbar could be made again with relative ease.    [[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 13:57, 10 June 2008 (UTC)

:I vote for deleting them too, its just extra weight thats taking up space on the server and isn't serving any purpose, if any of them Do have anything relevant, then move it over onto another page or put it back in with fixed links [[User:Cysaki|Cysaki]] ([[User talk:Cysaki|talk]]) 01:46, 11 June 2008 (UTC)

: While I have linked the Navbar to the contents page, this was for pure aesthetics.  I just wanted to show that the lesson plan is split into multiple parts.  Additionally, I've sorted out all the sections on the page.  Feel free to move some if you believe they belong elsewhere.  [[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 06:15, 11 June 2008 (UTC)

: I was going to wait another couple of days, but figured this topic has gotten the attention of everyone interested. I've deleted all but the &quot;Parts&quot; pages and the ones Retropunk put on the [[Japanese/Contents]] page. I guess they are useful for now.
: Any of these can be restored, so feel free to speak up if you'd like some of them back. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:27, 15 June 2008 (UTC)

::Sorry to join in here so late. I did a lot of work in the [[Japanese]] book to change colons to slashes in titles (like moving Japanese:Contents to Japanese/Contents and the like), with which I assume my work with these pages was concerned. I never finished the project because I realized I was in way over my head (speaking three words of Japanese, and not understanding the layout of the book), so I stopped. It's still a mess, and I would not object to these navigation aids being deleted.

I went on a spree, weeding out unused and out-dated templates. There are several more that I think should maybe go. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:47, 2 July 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Demand'''

== Individual Demand Functions ==
[[Image:TE-Demand-IndividualDemand.png|thumb|right|400px|Individual demand curve]]
[[Image:TE-Demand-EngelCurve.png|thumb|right|400px|Engel Curve]]
[[Image:TE-Demand-BudgetLinePivots.png|thumb|right|400px|Budget Line Pivots: To get the demand curve, change relative price (say P1). The Budget Line Pivots and the equilibrium solution changes.  Thus consumer demand depends on price and income.  Plot &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; vs. &lt;math&gt;X_1*&lt;/math&gt;, this is the conventional demand curve we began with. ]]

The demand function is a relationship between the quantity of a good/service that an individual will consume at different prices, holding other prices and income constant. Every point on the demand function is a utility maximizing point. In effect, the demand curve is a translation from utility metric space into dollar metric space. Thus, point 'e' in the diagram above is a point on the demand curve.

To construct the demand curve simply vary the price of one good holding the price of other goods and income constant. In graphical terms this is represented as in the diagrams below. Note that the equilibrium points in the upper diagram have their counterparts in 'quantity space' in the lower diagram. Therefore, this shows that prices or expenditure information provides a measure of people's preferences and can be used in making assessments  with respect to valuation.

An Engel curve is also associated with the development of the demand curve from the utility maximizing framework. An Engel curve is the locus of combinations of goods that an individual would consume if they were faced with changes in income holding all prices constant. Pictorially this would mean a parallel shift in the budget constraint either up or down if income rises or falls, respectively. This Engel curve is also known as an income-consumption curve.

* normal goods: the Engel curve is upward sloping
* inferior goods: Engel curve is downward sloping
* perfect substitutes: Engel curve is positively slope with a slope value of &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; 
* perfect complements: Engel curve is positively sloped with a slope equal to &lt;math&gt;P_1 + P_2&lt;/math&gt;


Homothetic Preferences depend only on the ratio of goods in the consumption bundle. This means that homothetic preferences will yield straight line Engel curves which pass through the origin. This has the interpretation that if income goes up by a factor &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; , the demand bundle goes up by a factor &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Log-linear preferences are an example of homothetic preferences but not all homothetic preferences are log-linear.

The demand curve is defined as the relationship between price and quantity in which the quantity demanded is the unknown and the price is the exogenously given variable. The relationship is represented as:
&lt;math&gt;Q=Q(P)&lt;/math&gt;

The inverse demand curve  is simply the monotone transformation of the 'ordinary' demand curve. The inverse demand curve indicates, for each level of demand for good 1, the price which would have to be charged for the consumer to consume a given amount. The inverse demand curve  is represented as:
&lt;math&gt;P=P(Q)&lt;/math&gt;

== Aggregate Demand ==
[[Image:TE-Demand-Aggregate-Private.png|thumb|400 px| left|Aggregation of demand of private goods]]
[[Image:TE-Demand-Aggregate-Public.png|thumb|400 px| right|Aggregation of demand of public goods]]

Moving from individual to aggregate demand requires that we sum individual demands in some way. The level of aggregation is determined by the nature of the issue at hand. Demand functions can be defined over socio-economic groups, cities, states and economy wide. There are numerous issues of 'aggregation' not least of which is how one handles the diversity of consumer preferences while aggregating. 

One of the interesting issues is how to aggregate given the [[Transportation_Economics/Ownership#The_Nature_of_Transportation_as_a_Good_and_Its_Ownership|nature of the good]]. This is an issue in transportation since some people consider transportation infrastructure 'quasi-public' goods. 

&lt;!-- Another interesting issue is how to handle income distribution when aggregating since demand for many goods will depend not simply on the level of income in the group in question but also the distribution of that income. --&gt;



Private goods: if I increase my consumption I reduce the amount available for anyone else, the aggregation from individual to aggregate is to sum horizontally. (Left) This reflects the scarcity of the good. 

Public goods: if I increase my consumption, the amount available remains,  the aggregation from individual to aggregate should be vertical. (Right) P=society’s willingness to pay

== Input Demand Theory ==
[[Image:TE-Demand-IsoqantIsocost.png|thumb|left|400px|Isoquant and Isocost Curves ]]
[[Image:TE-Demand-CostCurve.png|thumb|right|400px|To get the cost curve, change the output level, then the isoquant moves and minimum cost is achieved at different K-L combinations.]]


To date we have looked at demand for consumers.  Demand for firms applies similar ideas.  For instance, a firm may need to choose a trucking company to ship its goods.  It can either approach the problem as cost minimization or profit maximization, which are called Duals of each other, and when solved will produce the same answer.

Cost minimization: given the output level Q', minimize costs.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
An example of this constrained optimization problem just illustrated is:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp; \text{Min C }=\text{ }wL + rK \\ 
 &amp; \text{s}\text{.t}\text{. }F(K,L)=Q' \\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where 
* K = Kapital
* L = Labor
* w = wage rate
* r = interest rate

The Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution (MRTS) = w/r.

&lt;/div&gt;
[[Image:TE-Demand-CostCurve2.png|thumb|right|400px|Plot Q vs. C(Q)]]
In a competitive market, and a whole set of associated assumptions, firms maximize profits by producing when 

Marginal Cost = Marginal Revenue.

Profit &lt;math&gt;\Pi = PQ - C(Q)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Elasticity ==
The utility function is a representation of consumer preferences and a demand function is the mapping of utility (and hence preferences) into quantity space. The elasticity is a summary measure of the demand curve and it is therefore influenced to a great extent by the underlying preference structure. Elasticity is defined as a proportionate change in one variable over the proportionate change in another variable. It, therefore, provides a measure of how sensitive one variable is to changes in some other variable.

For example:
* How sensitive are people to purchasing transit tickets if the fare went up 5%, 10% or 50%? 
* How would the demand for housing change if mortgage rates fell by 30% 
* How would the demand for international air travel change if airfares went up 15%? 

All of these questions are really asking, &quot;what is the elasticity of demand with respect to some variable&quot;?

Price elasticity of demand (PED) can be defined as&lt;ref&gt;Parkin; Powell; Matthews (2002). pp.74-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillespie43&quot;&gt;Gillespie, Andrew (2007). p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gwartney425&quot;&gt;Gwartney, James D.; Stroup, Richard L.; Sobel, Russell S. (2008). p.425.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E_d = \frac{\%\ \mbox{change in quantity demanded}}{\%\ \mbox{change in price}} = \frac{\Delta Q_d/Q_d}{\Delta P/P}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Own-price Elasticity ===
the price elasticity of demand (own price elasticity) is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon _{ii}=\frac{p_{i}\Delta q_{i}}{q_{i}\Delta p_{i}}=\frac{p_{i}\partial q_{i}}{q_{i}\partial p_{i}}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that dq/dp is the slope of the demand function so unless there is a very particular type of demand function the slope is not the same as the elasticity.

In general, own price elasticity is negative.  An increase in &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt; should increase the consumption of &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt;, (all else equal).  However it is often referred to as positive, this is just confusing.  All goods have a price elasticity, however, if the elasticity is less than -1, than the good is called elastic and if the elasticity is between 0 and -1, then the good is inelastic.

This is important when looking at the effect of fuel prices on travel demand.

=== Cross-price Elasticity ===

Cross price elasticity examines how the quantity of good i consumed changes as the price of j changes:


&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon _{ij}=\frac{p_{j}\Delta q_{i}}{q_{i}\Delta p_{j}}=\frac{p_{j}\partial q_{i}}{q_{i}\partial p_{j}}&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;P_j&lt;/math&gt; increases and &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; increases, then &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q_j&lt;/math&gt; are substitutes.
If &lt;math&gt;P_j&lt;/math&gt; decreases and &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; increases, then &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q_j&lt;/math&gt; are complements

This is important in examining modal competition.

=== Income Elasticity ===

&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon _{iY}=\frac{Y\partial q_{i}}{q_{i}\partial Y}&lt;/math&gt;

If Y increases and Qi increases, then Qi is a normal good.
If Y increases and Qi decreases then Qi is an inferior good.

Examples are auto ownership, and the difference between new and used cars.

'''Examining the Metabolic Processes Underpinning Critical Swimming in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) using in vivo &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P NMR Spectroscopy'''

In a recent study, in vivo 31P NMR spectroscopy was used in the examination of the metabolic processes underpinning critical swimming in Atlantic cod Critical swimming speed (Ucrit) is identified as the speed at which a fish can no longer propel itself forward and becomes exhausted. 31P-NMR spectroscopy was used in combination with a Brett-type swim tunnel in order to perform a detailed analysis of the processes occurring during a Ucrit swim test.

The Ucrit swim test was originally intended for analyzing the dependence of salmon fitness on temperature. Brett defined this critical speed as the swimming velocity of a fish that could no longer propel itself forward as a result of exhaustion. Previous analyses of different swimming modes and metabolic processes that fuel muscle contractions in fish have established that red muscle is oxidative and produces slow contractions during subcarangiform swimming, while white muscle is glycolytic and responsible for fast twitch contractions, which produce tail kicks during burst swimming. Increases in inorganic phosphate and acidification of the intracellular milieu were observed during the muscular fatigue that occurs during the critical swimming speed, but the exact processes involved have not been established. However, the products of anaerobic kick-and-glide – fast twitch – bursts leave products to indicate the metabolic state of the fish. These products have allowed researches to examine the relationship between swimming gait and metabolic processes. Although the Ucrit swim test provides information about the swimming performance of Atlantic cod and metabolic products from Atlantic cod muscles during the Ucrit, they do not elaborate on the underlying processes such as the causes of fatigue during this speed.

In vivo 31P NMR spectroscopy has been previously established as an efficient method for non-invasively monitoring intracellular pH changes in muscle and the metabolic statuses of phosphorous based compounds such as ATP, phosphocreatine (PCr) and intracellular phosphate (Pi). Although previous studies were limited to analyzing resting or restrained animals, there have been increasingly developed techniques for non-invasively examining unrestrained fish under resting conditions. In this study, in vivo 31P NMR proved to be a practical and effective method for analyzing the metabolic processes of Atlantic cod during Ucrit tests.

First generation cultured North Eastern Arctic cod Gadus morhua L. were held at 4ºC for a minimum of two weeks prior to being moved to a 10ºC aquarium and were fed to satiation twice a week. Feeding was halted for five to seven days prior to experimentation.

The swim tunnel apparatus comprised three major constituents: A Perspex™ pipe was attached to a circulatory system and was fed through a 40 cm inner diameter Bruker Biospec 47/40 that operated at 4.7 T. When the pipe was closed, seawater was hermetically sealed to measure oxygen consumption. When open, a reservoir of constantly aerated seawater was used to flush the system. Three large taps had been used to alternate between the two circulations. The hermetic seal of the closed system was periodically checked by purging the seawater with nitrogen gas overnight and then monitoring the oxygen content of seawater over a twelve hour period. There were no detected increases in oxygen content, during the course of the experiment. A digital motion camera system was connected to a computer and used to monitor the fish. Circulations were temperature controlled and all swimming speeds were corrected for solid blocking effects.
A substantial amount of pioneer studies in 31P-NMR involved freshwater fish studies. Early studies were conducted exclusively on resting or restrained animals, but recent innovations have allowed for the non-invasive analysis of unrestrained fish under resting conditions, such as the experimental procedures followed in this study.

In vivo 31P-NMR spectra were prominently obtained from white muscle with miniscule contribution from red muscle. Spectra were collected using a 200 μs bp32 pulse with a flip angle of 45º, sweep width of 5000 Hz at 4 k and a repetition time of 0.8 s. A total of 256 scans were collected, which resulted in an overall acquisition time of approximately three minutes. NMR spectra were recorded over a 30 min. time period, for each swimming speed.

Experimental findings indicated that a metabolic transition point occurred as the cod approached Ucrit. This transition was from steady state aerobic metabolism to anaerobic metabolism, which occurred simultaneously as the fish changed gait from subcarangiform to kick-and-glide swimming. Metabolic processes that underpin the swimming transition from slow swimming to kick-and-glide and then to complete fatigue were measured online and established the Ucrit as the point of complete fatigue; as Ucrit was approached, oxygen consumption and tail-beat frequency increased. It was determined that the observed muscular fatigue was a result of ΔG/dξATP dropping to –49.8±0.7•kJ•mol–1. This value appeared to fall below a specific threshold value that was required by transporters to maintain ion gradients and fuel muscles.

It was observed that as Ucrit began, Pi started to increase while the pHi began to acidify. Researchers concluded that determining when the pHi decreased (at or before Ucrit) would be crucial information for evaluating the transition from steady state aerobic metabolism to non-steady state anaerobic metabolism. It had been previously hypothesized that physiological accumulations of Pi are responsible for decreases in power generated in muscles as Pi moves into the sarcoplasmic reticulum to precipitate calcium ions and reduce steady state tension. Mean Pi concentration at Ucrit was elevated, which led to increased force re-development during rapid contraction-relaxation cycles. These results were indicative of kick-and-glide bursts while swimming. In addition, detected drops in pHi resulted in increased excitability of working skinned muscle fibres. It was established that as Pi increased and PCr decreased, cellular energy stores were depleted at Ucrit in order to buffer cellular ATP concentrations. Consequential drops in pHi indicated that anaerobic metabolism was used to maintain ATP levels.

Altogether, researchers concluded that in vivo 31P-NMR spectroscopy combined with a Brett-type swim tunnel was an efficient method for analyzing metabolic traits of Atlantic cod during the critical swimming velocity. With this method, it was determined that as swimming speed increased, and gait was changed from subcarangiform to kick-and-glide swimming prior to the critical swimming speed, intracellular pHi decreased during an exponential increase of oxygen consumption. Simultaneously, PCr levels had dropped while Pi levels increased. These changes had maximized at Ucrit and were restored during recovery. The Gibbs free energy change of ATP hydrolysis was minimal at Ucrit, and was determined to be the most significant factor leading to exhaustion in the cod. This implied that a transition from steady state aerobic metabolism to non-steady state anaerobic metabolism ultimately led to the complete exhaustion of aerobic and anaerobic fuel reserves, at the critical swimming velocity.

'''&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P MR Spectroscopy in Assessment of Response to Antiviral Therapy for Hepatitis C Virus-Related Liver Disease'''

31P MR spectroscopy has been recruited to assess responses to antiviral therapy for hepatitis C virus-related liver disease. The purpose of this study was to assess the implementation of 31P-NMR as a biomarker of response to interferon and ribavirin treatment. Interferon and ribavirin have been proven to eradicate the virus in at least half of recorded cases, preventing progression of HCV infection to cirrhosis. Researchers used 31P-NMR spectroscopy to observe increases in the ratio of phosphomonoester (PME) to phosphodiester (PDE) of the liver with increasing severity of hepatitis C-related disease. 

An estimated 3% of the global population has chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), while approximately four million people are newly infected, each year. In approximately 20% of cases, fibrosis develops into cirrhosis, which leads to hepatocellular cancer in 5% of cases each year. Liver biopsies serve as the reference standards for staging and grading of chronic liver disease. However, this is an invasive procedure with a low mortality rate but high error rate, which is prominently caused by undersampling. This has compelled researchers to develop more effective noninvasive methods for evaluating liver damage. One such technique for characterizing chronic liver disease is 31P-NMR spectroscopy. In the past, this method proved to be an efficient means for determining disease severity.

Forty-seven patients (29 men and 18 women with a mean age of 47.5 years) with biopsy-proven HCV-related liver disease underwent viral eradication treatment with interferon and ribavirin, and were enrolled in routine clinical protocols in the United Kingdom. All patients experienced baseline liver biopsies in order to assess the severity of hepatic inflammation before any decision was made to follow through with antiviral treatment. All patients also underwent baseline pretreatment with 31P MR spectroscopy within three months of commencing viral eradication treatment. After treatment began, all patients underwent repeated imaging every six months for up to eighteen months. All patients were also administered with interferon α and ribavirin or pegylated interferon α and ribavirin treatment for at least twelve weeks.

Hepatic 31P MR spectra were obtained with a 1.5 T MRI unit with an enveloping transmitter coil and separate surface receiver coil. Both coils were double-turned for protons at 64 MHz and phosphorus at 26 MHz. A T1-weighted image confirmed patient positioning and was obtained with the proton signals. Spectra were localized to a centrally placed voxel within the liver with an image-selected in vivo spectroscopy sequence. A voxel location within the right liver and away from major vessels had been used for each patient and was consistent for all baseline and follow-up images. Total examination time lasted forty minutes with ten-minute acquisition periods, for each 31P MR sequence. All imaging was conducted overnight.

Quantitation of 31P signals were recorded with respect to time with the Advanced Method for Accurate, Robust, and Efficient Spectral fitting (AMARES) algorithm. This algorithm was in the Magnetic Resonance User Interface (MRUI) software program. Blinded observers analyzed and rechecked MR spectra in order to assure anonymity. PME, PDE and inorganic phosphate (Pi) peak areas were obtained with respect to total phosphorous signal intensity.

Patients were classified as responders to viral eradication treatment on the basis of sustained viral clearance that was obtained from quantitative HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction studies. Researchers defined a sustained virologic response as repeatedly undetectable HCV RNA measured at least six months after finishing antiviral treatment.

Evaluation and treatment of increasing numbers of patients with HCV infection has developed into a major clinical concern. Although biopsies remain the reference standard for the staging and grading of most cases of HCV-related liver disease, there are still considerable risks for this procedure. It has also become increasingly evident that liver biopsies produce results that are less accurate than those obtained with 31P-NMR methods. One of the more significant advantages of 31P MR spectroscopy over liver biopsies is its noninvasive application and substantially larger sampling of the liver – many times larger than liver biopsy samples. Treatment with interferon-α or pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin was proven to be an efficient form of viral eradication therapy for patients with HCV-related liver disease via 31P MR. Viral clearance with this method occurred in at least half of all patients, but was dependent upon the underlying genotype. 
PME/PDE ratio determinations via 31P MR spectroscopy have proven to be significant indicators of cirrhosis. In this study, a significant decrease in the PME/PDE ratio toward normal was observed in the sustained virologic responder group. However, this ratio remained static or increased in patients who were virologic nonresponders. PME resonance had also contained contributions from cell membrane precursors, while PDE resonance contained contributions from cell membrane degradation complexes. These features allowed the PME/PDE ratio to provide information on liver cell turnover. With this knowledge, researchers were surprised to observe in a reduction of this ratio after effective viral eradication treatment and within three of four responders in the cirrhosis group.

31P MR spectroscopic assessment of PME/PDE ratios was not without faults. Specifically, three patients from this study were discovered to have a PME/PDE ratio reduction, which suggested attenuation of liver disease. This was contrary to findings that revealed these patients to not have any sustained response, based upon results of longer-term follow-up virologic studies. Two patients were also discovered to have worsening PME/PDE ratios, although abatement of the virus was established with longer-term virologic follow-up studies. It seems that the most practical approach to assessing PME/PDE ratios in HCV-related liver disease patients would include long-term virologic follow-up studies. Researchers had also correlated histological findings at least twenty-four months after antiviral treatment, in order to secure the accuracy and reliability of the 31P MR spectroscopic method that was used. Another potential fault in this study could have resulted from excluding correlative serologic biomarkers of fibrosis. This led to difficulty during the follow-up procedures of the patients. To limit experimental error from excluding these biomarkers, a larger group of patients could have been used.

Altogether, it seems that PME/PDE ratio determinations via 31P MR spectroscopy likely serve as significant indicators of responses to antiviral treatment. In addition, 31P MR spectroscopy has proven to be an efficient substitution for liver biopsy in this assessment. Researchers stated that the MR spectroscopic sequence used for this study may be freely added to any standard MR liver imaging protocol. Although the sequence does lengthen the imaging protocol by approximately ten minutes, there is a notable increase in significant data pertinent to the metabolites in patients with hepatitis C.

'''Real-Time Noninvasive Assessment of Pancreatic ATP Levels During Cold Preservation'''

31P-NMR spectroscopy has been used to non-invasively monitor rat and porcine pancreatic ATP:Pi ratios. This method allowed investigators to simultaneously assess the efficacy of existing protocols for cold preservation (CP) in maintaining organ quality. In the rat pancreas model, it was observed that CP with histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution (HTK)/perfluorodecalin two-layer method (TLM) substantially improved ATP:Pi ratio levels when compared to CP in (HTK) exposed to air. When compared to TLM, preservation of rat pancreata in an HTK solution saturated with molecular oxygen resulted in a slightly greater ATP:Pi ratio improvement. As a result, TLM was determined to be effective for improving oxygenation and elevating ATP levels in the rat pancreas model. Although, when the TLM stored porcine pancreata was analyzed, researchers found no recognizable ATP peaks in the NMR spectra. This indicated that TLM was less effective in this model. These results support previous studies that indicate TLM cannot fully oxygenate larger porcine and human pancreata. 

The increase in the ATP:Pi ratio over the first nine hours of CP with the TLM might have reflected reoxygenation dynamics and ATP regeneration that followed ischemia during procurement. In addition, the ATP:Pi ratio reduction after twelve hours of CP was consistent with the decreased isolation yields after eight to nine hours of CP. This was believed to indicate the presence of crucial, additional factors that limit CP. Researchers determined that the noninvasive capability of 31P-NMR to provide real time information allowed it to serve as efficient tool when identifying factors that limit CP as well as gauging and evaluating modern methods of organ preservation.

'''Effects of Lipid Chain Length and Unsaturation on Bicelles Stability: A Phosphorus NMR Study'''

31P NMR has been used to determine the effects of lipid chain length and unsaturation on bicelles stability. The majority of previous studies involving the magnetically alignable system formed by a binary mixture of long- and short-chain lipids were based on the mixture of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (D14PC) and 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (D6PC) lipids. Researchers have recently revealed that a substantial portion of the phase diagrams of this lipid mixture may be understood by considering partial miscibility of long-chain and short-chain lipids when heated above the melting transition temperature (Tm) of the long-chain lipids. When the chain lengths of either one of the two lipids were modified, researchers were capable of controlling their miscibility. This allowed manipulation of the intervals of temperature and composition where spontaneous alignment is observed in a magnetic field. Using 31P-NMR, researchers demonstrated that the unique properties of these binary lipid mixtures are correlated with the tendency for short-chain lipids to diffuse into bilayer regions. Researchers also established that lipid mixtures with comparable properties could be formed with unsaturated lipids such as 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC).

It was determined that the majority of the distinctive bicellular mixture properties are preserved when the lipid chain lengths of the long- and short-chain lipids are modified by one or two carbons. It was also discovered that these same properties were maintained among a large fraction of unsaturated lipids such as 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC). Experimental results indicated that the temperature domain where spontaneous alignment was observed in a magnetic field is contingent upon the lipids used. This temperature contingency was determined to be a result of the miscibility variation between lipids. At a given temperature, it was discovered that this miscibility depends upon mismatched lipid chain lengths, the main transition temperature of the long-chain lipid and the affinity of short-chain lipids for the edge sections. Researchers grasped an understanding of the underlying forces that are responsible for forming alignable lipidic structures. As a result, it is now possible to predict which lipid mixtures will align and to design mixtures that will align within a desired temperature range. These capabilities have proven to be especially useful in biological applications that include partial orientation of soluble proteins, membrane protein incorporation or drug encapsulation.

31P NMR has proven to be an efficient, noninvasive technique for monitoring metabolic systems, profiling the roles of ATP and other phosphorous containing compounds in biological systems, and observing the impact of particular stimuli on biological systems that utilize phosphorous containing compounds. Disease research appears to be a practical, up-and-coming application for 31P-NMR. In particular, 31P-NMR has already been applied to detailing the responses of antiviral therapy for hepatitis C virus-related liver disease and has also been used to profile phosphorous based compound activity in Alzheimer’s and McArdle’s disease. 31P NMR has also been recently applied to food analysis and appears to be a significant future application for profiling levels of phosphorous-based compounds in foods. It is also likely that this technique will have increased usage in future studies of metabolomics, which involves mapping human metabolic processes, the metabolites involved in those processes, and assessing the impact of stimuli on these processes. Current metabolomics research recruits 31P NMR spectroscopy in recording the toxic actions of dinoseb in medaka (Oryzias latipes) embryos. 31P NMR had been used to characterize ATP and phosphocreatine metabolism within the intact embryos.

==What did he do that made him important?==

==What did he do before that?==
Steuben was schooled in Breslau by Jesuits and, by the age of 17, was a Prussian officer in the military. During the Seven Years' War he was a member of an infantry unit but served primarily as a staff officer. By 1761 he had risen to the rank of captain and was serving in the Prussian general headquarters.He trained the Army from 1778 to the end of the war in 1783, and his manual for training was in use until the War of 1812. The army was greatly reduced in size at the end of the war, and Steuben was one of many Prussian officers suddenly without work.

==What did he do after that?==
Steuben eventually settled on a small estate in the vicinity of Utica, New York, on land granted to him for his military service. He later assisted in the founding of the Society of the Cincinnati and was appointed a Regent for what evolved into the State University of New York. He never married and had no children. He is buried at what is now the Steuben Memorial State Historic Site.

==How do we remember him today?==
There are many things named after him including buildings, statues made in his honors, cities, and highschools.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Land use forecasting''' undertakes to project the distribution and intensity of trip generating activities in the urban area.  In practice, land use models are demand driven, using as inputs the aggregate information on growth produced by an aggregate economic forecasting activity.  Land use estimates are inputs to the transportation planning process. 

The discussion of land use forecasting to follow begins with a review of the Chicago Area Transportation Study (CATS) effort.  CATS researchers did interesting work, but did not produce a transferable forecasting model, and researchers elsewhere worked to develop models.  After reviewing the CATS work, the discussion will turn to the first model to be widely known and emulated:  the Lowry model developed by Ira S. Lowry when he was working for the Pittsburgh Regional Economic Study.  Second and third generation Lowry models are now available and widely used, as well as interesting features incorporated in models that are not widely used.

Today, the transportation planning activities attached to metropolitan planning organizations are the loci for the care and feeding of regional land use models. In the US, interest in and use of models is spotty, for most agencies are concerned with short run planning and day-to-day decisions.  Interest is higher in Europe and elsewhere.

Even though there isn’t much use of full blown land use modeling in the US today, we need to understand the subject:  the concepts and analytic tools pretty much define how land use-transportation matters are thought about and handled; there is a good bit of interest in the research community where there have been important developments; and when the next upturn in infrastructure development comes along the present models will form the starting place for work.

== Land Use Analysis at the Chicago Area Transportation Study ==

In brief, the CATS analysis of the 1950s was “by mind and hand” distribute growth.  The product was maps developed with a rule-based process. The rules by which land use was allocated were based on state-of-the art knowledge and concepts, and it hard to fault CATS on those grounds.  The CATS took advantage of Colin Clark’s extensive work on the distribution of population densities around city centers.  Theories of city form were available, sector and concentric circle concepts, in particular.  Urban ecology notions were important at the University of Chicago and University of Michigan.  Sociologists and demographers at the University of Chicago had begun its series of neighborhood surveys with an ecological flavor.  Douglas Carroll, the CATS director, had studied with Amos Hawley, an urban ecologist at Michigan.

[[File:DensityGradient.png|right|350px|Stylized Urban Density Gradient]]

Colin Clark studied the population densities of many cities, and he found traces similar to those in the figure.  Historic data show how the density line has changed over the years.  To project the future, one uses changes in the parameters as a function of time to project the shape of density in the future, say in 20 years. The city spreads glacier-like.  The area under the curve is given by population forecasts.

The CATS did extensive land use and activity surveys, taking advantage of the City work done by the Chicago Planning Commission.  Hock’s work forecasting activities said what the land uses-activities were that would be accommodated under the density curve.  Existing land use data were arrayed in cross section.  Land uses were allocated in a manner consistent with the existing pattern.
	
The study area was divided into transportation analysis zones:  small zones where there was a lot of activity, larger zones elsewhere.  The original CATS scheme reflected its Illinois State connections.  Zones extended well away from the city. The zones were defined to take advantage of Census data at the block and minor civil division levels.  They also strove for homogeneous land use and urban ecology attributes.  

The first land use forecasts at CATS arrayed developments using “by hand” techniques, as stated.  We do not fault the “by hand” technique – the then state of computers and data systems forced it.  It was a rule based land use allocation.  Growth was the forcing function, as were inputs from the economic study.  Growth said that the population density envelope would have to shift.  The land uses implied by the mix of activities were allocated from “Where is the land available?” and “What’s the use now?” Considerations.   Certain types of activities allocate easily: steel mills, warehouses, etc.

Conceptually, the allocation rules seem important.  There is lot of spatial autocorrelation in urban land uses; it’s driven by historical path dependence:  this sort of thing got started here and seeds more of the same.  This autocorrelation was lost somewhat in the step from “by hand” to analytic models.

The CATS procedure was not viewed with favor by the emerging Urban Transportation Planning professional peer group, and in the late 1950s there was interest in the development of analytic forecasting procedures.  At about the same time, similar interests emerged to meet urban redevelopment and sewer planning needs, and interest in analytic urban analysis emerged in political science, economics, and geography.

== Lowry Model ==
[[File:LowryModel.png|right|600px|Flowchart of Lowry Model]]

Hard on the heels of the CATS work, several agencies and investigators began to explore analytic forecasting techniques, and between 1956 and the early 1960s a number of modeling techniques evolved. Irwin (1965) provides a review of the status of emerging models.  One of the models, the Lowry model, was widely adopted.

Supported at first by local organizations and later by a Ford Foundation grant to the RAND Corporation, Ira S. Lowry undertook a three-year study in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.  (Work at RAND will be discussed later.)  The environment was data rich, and there were good professional relationships available in the emerging emphasis on location and regional economies in the Economics Department at the University of Pittsburgh under the leadership of Edgar M. Hoover. The structure of the Lowry model is shown on the flow chart.

The flow chart gives the logic of the Lowry model.  It is demand driven.  First, the model responds to an increase in basic employment.  It then responds to the consequent impacts on service activities.  As Lowry treated his model and as the flow chart indicates, the model is solved by iteration.  But the structure of the model is such that iteration is not necessary.

Although the language giving justification for the model specification is an economic language and Lowry is an economist, the model is not an economic model.  Prices, markets, and the like do not enter.

A review of Lowry’s publication will suggest reasons why his approach has been widely adopted.  The publication was the first full elaboration of a model, data analysis and handling problems, and computations.  Lowry’s writing is excellent.  He is candid and discusses his reasoning in a clear fashion.  One can imagine an analyst elsewhere reading Lowry and thinking, “Yes, I can do that.”

The diffusion of innovations of the model is interesting.  Lowry was not involved in consulting, and his word of mouth contacts with transportation professionals were quite limited.  His interest was and is in housing economics.  Lowry did little or no “selling.”  We learn that people will pay attention to good writing and an idea whose time has come.

The model makes extensive use of gravity or interaction decaying with distance functions.  Use of “gravity model” ideas was common at the time Lowry developed his model; indeed, the idea of the gravity model was at least 100 years old at the time.  It was under much refinement at the time of Lowry’s work; persons such as Alan Voorhees, Mort Schneider, John Hamburg, Roger Creighon, and Walter Hansen made important contributions.  (See Carrothers 1956).

The Lowry Model provided a point of departure for work in a number of places.  Goldner (1971) traces its impact and modifications made.  Steven Putnam at the University of Pennsylvania used it to develop PLUM (Projective Land Use Model) and I(incremental)PLUM.  We estimate that Lowry derivatives are used in most MPO studies, but most of today’s workers do not recognize the Lowry heritage, the derivatives are one or two steps away from the mother logic.

== Penn-Jersey Model ==

[[File:Penn-Jersey.png|right|600 px|Flowchart of Penn-Jersey land use forecasting model]]

The P-J (Penn-Jersey, greater Philadelphia area) analysis had little impact on planning practice.  It will now be discussed, even so, because it illustrates what planners might have done, given available knowledge building blocks.  It is an introduction to some of the work by researchers who are not practicing planners.  

The P-J study scoped widely for concepts and techniques.  It scoped well beyond the CATS and Lowry efforts, especially taking advantage of things that had come along in the late 1950s.  It was well funded and viewed by the State and the Bureau of Public Roads as a research and a practical planning effort.  Its Director’s background was in public administration, and leading personnel were associated with the urban planning department at the University of Pennsylvania.  The P-J study was planning and policy oriented. 

The P-J study drew on several factors &quot;in the air&quot;. First, there was a lot of excitement about economic activity analysis and the applied math that it used, at first, linear programming.  T. J. Koopmans, the developer of activity analysis, had worked in transportation.  There was pull for transportation (and communications) applications, and the tools and interested professionals were available.

There was work on flows on networks, through nodes, and activity location.  Orden (1956) had suggested the use of conservation equations when networks involved intermediate modes; flows from raw material sources through manufacturing plants to market were treated by Beckmann and Jacob Marschak (1955) and Goldman (1958) had treated commodity flows and the management of empty vehicles.

Maximal flow and synthesis problems were also treated (Boldreff 1955, Gomory and Hu 1962, Ford and Fulkerson 1956, Kalaba and Juncosa 1956, Pollack 1964).  Balinski (1960) considered the problem of fixed cost. Finally, Cooper (1963) considered the problem of optimal location of nodes. The problem of investment in link capacity was treated by Garrison and Marble (1958) and the issue of the relationship between the length of the planning time-unit and investment decisions was raised by Quandt  (1960) and Pearman (1974).

A second set of building blocks was evolving in location economics, regional science, and geography.  Edgar Dunn (1954) undertook an extension of the classic von Thünen analysis of the location of rural land uses. Also, there had been a good bit of work in Europe on the interrelations of economic activity and transportation, especially during the railroad deployment era, by German and Scandinavian economists.  That work was synthesized and augmented in the 1930’s by August Lösch, and his The Location of Economic Activities was translated into English during the late 1940s.  Edgar Hoover’s work with the same title was also published in the late 1940s. Dunn’s analysis was mainly graphical; static equilibrium was claimed by counting equations and unknowns.  There was no empirical work (unlike Garrison 1958). For its time, Dunn’s was a rather elegant work.

William Alonso’s (1964) work soon followed.  It was modeled closely on Dunn’s and also was a University of Pennsylvania product.  Although Alonso’s book was not published until 1964, its content was fairly widely known earlier, having been the subject of papers at professional meetings and Committee on Urban Economics (CUE) seminars.  Alonso’s work became much more widely known than Dunn’s, perhaps because it focused on “new” urban problems.  It introduced the notion of bid rent and treated the question of the amount of land consumed as a function of land rent.
	
Wingo (1961) was also available.  It was different in style and thrust from Alonso and Dunn’s books and touched more on policy and planning issues. Dunn’s important, but little noted, book undertook analysis of location rent, the rent referred to by Marshall as situation rent.  Its key equation was:

&lt;math&gt;
R = Y\left( {P - c} \right) - Ytd
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
''R'' = rent per unit of land,			
''P'' = market price per unit of product,			
''c'' = cost of production per unit of product,
''d'' = distance to market, and
''t'' = unit transportation cost.

In addition, there were also demand and supply schedules.

This formulation by Dunn is very useful, for it indicates how land rent ties to transportation cost.  Alonso’s urban analysis starting point was similar to Dunn’s, though he gave more attention to market clearing by actors bidding for space.

The question of exactly how rents tied to transportation was sharpened by those who took advantage of the duality properties of linear programming.  First, there was a spatial price equilibrium perspective, as in Henderson (1957, 1958) Next, Stevens (1961) merged rent and transportation concepts in a simple, interesting paper.  In addition, Stevens showed some optimality characteristics and discussed decentralized decision-making.  This simple paper is worth studying for its own sake and because the model in the P-J study took the analysis into the urban area, a considerable step.

Stevens 1961 paper used the linear programming version of the transportation, assignment, translocation of masses problem of Koopmans, Hitchcock, and Kantorovich.  His analysis provided an explicit link between transportation and location rent.  It was quite transparent, and it can be extended simply. In response to the initiation of the P-J study, Herbert and Stevens (1960) developed the core model of the P-J Study.  Note that this paper was published before the 1961 paper.  Even so, the 1961 paper came first in Stevens’ thinking.

The Herbert-Stevens model was housing centered, and the overall study had the view that the purpose of transportation investments and related policy choices was to make Philadelphia a good place to live.  Similar to the 1961 Stevens paper, the model assumed that individual choices would lead to overall optimization.  

The P-J region was divided into ''u'' small areas recognizing ''n'' household groups and ''m'' residential bundles.  Each residential bundle was defined on the house of apartment, the amenity level in the neighborhood (parks, schools, etc.), and the trip set associated with the site. There is an objective function:

&lt;math&gt;
\max Z = \sum_{k = 1}^u {\sum_{i = 1}^n {\sum_{h = 1}^m {x_{ih}^k \left( {b_{ih}  - c_{ih}^k } \right)} } } \quad x_{ih}^k  \geq 0
&lt;/math&gt;

	
wherein x&lt;sub&gt;ihk&lt;/sub&gt;  is the number of households in group ''i'' selecting residential bundle ''h'' in area ''k''.  The items in brackets are b&lt;sub&gt;ih&lt;/sub&gt;  (the budget allocated by ''i'' to bundle ''h'') and c&lt;sub&gt;ihk&lt;/sub&gt;, the purchase cost of ''h'' in area ''k''.  In short, the sum of the differences between what households are willing to pay and what they have to pay is maximized; a surplus is maximized.  The equation says nothing about who gets the surplus:  it is divided between households and those who supply housing in some unknown way. There is a constraint equation for each area limiting the land use for housing to the land supply available.

&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{i = 1}^n {\sum_{h = 1}^m {s_{ih} x_{ih}^k } }  \leq L^k 
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
s&lt;sub&gt;ih&lt;/sub&gt; = land used for bundle ''h''
L&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = land supply in area ''k''

And there is a constraint equation for each household group assuring that all folks can find housing.

&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{k = 1}^u {\sum_{h = 1}^m {x_{ih}^k } }  = N_i 
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
''N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = number of households in group ''i''

A policy variable is explicit, the land available in areas.  Land can be made available by changing zoning and land redevelopment.  Another policy variable is explicit when we write the dual of the maximization problem, namely:

&lt;math&gt;
\min Z' = \sum_{k = 1}^u {r^k L^k  + \sum_{i = 1}^n {v_i \left( { - N_i } \right)} } 
&lt;/math&gt;

Subject to:

&lt;math&gt;
  s_{ih} r^k  - v_i  \geq b_{ih}  - c_{ih}^k
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
  r^k  \geq 0  
&lt;/math&gt;

The variables are ''r&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' (rent in area ''k'') and ''v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' an unrestricted subsidy variable specific to each household group.  Common sense says that a policy will be better for some than others, and that is reasoning behind the subsidy variable.  The subsidy variable is also a policy variable because society may choose to subsidize housing budgets for some groups.  The constraint equations may force such policy actions.

It is apparent that the Herbert-Stevens scheme is a very interesting one.  Its also apparent that it is housing centered, and the tie to transportation planning is weak.  That question is answered when we examine the overall scheme for study, the flow chart of a single iteration of the model.  How the scheme works requires little study. The chart doesn’t say much about transportation.  Changes in the transportation system are displayed on the chart as if they are a policy matter.  

The word “simulate” appears in boxes five, eight, and nine.  The P-J modelers would say, “We are making choices about transportation improvements by examining the ways improvements work their way through urban development.  The measure of merit is the economic surplus created in housing.”  

Academics paid attention to the P-J study.  The Committee on Urban Economics was active at the time.  The committee was funded by the Ford Foundation to assist in the development of the nascent urban economics field.  It often met in Philadelphia for review of the P-J work.  Stevens and Herbert were less involved as the study went along. Harris gave intellectual leadership, and he published a fair amount about the study (1961, 1962). However, the P-J influence on planning practice was nil.  The study didn’t put transportation up front.  There were unsolvable data problems.  Much was promised but never delivered.  The Lowry model was already available.

== Kain Model ==

[[File:KainModel.png|right|600px|Figure - Causal arrow diagram illustrating Kain’s econometric model for transportation demand]]
About 1960, the Ford Foundation made a grant to the RAND Corporation to support work on urban transportation problems (Lowry’s work was supported in part by that grant).  The work was housed in the logistics division of RAND, where the economists at RAND were housed.  The head of that division was then Charles Zwick, who had worked on transportation topics previously.   

The RAND work ranged from new technology and the cost of tunneling to urban planning models and analyses with policy implications.  Some of the researchers at RAND were regular employees.  Most, however, were imported for short periods of time.  The work was published in several formats:  first in the RAND P series and RM series and then in professional publications or in book form.  Often, a single piece of work is available in differing forms at different places in the literature.

In spite of the diversity of topics and styles of work, one theme runs through the RAND work – the search for economic policy guides.  We see that theme in Kain (1962), which is discussed by de Neufville and Stafford, and the figure is adapted from their book.

Kain’s model dealt with direct and indirect affects.  Suppose income increases.  The increase has a direct effect on travel time and indirect affects through the use of land, auto ownership, and choice of mode. Work supported at RAND also resulted in Meyer, Kain and Wohl (1964).	These parts of the work at RAND had considerable influence on subsequent analysis (but not so much on practice as on policy).  John Meyer became President of the National Bureau of Economic Research and worked to refocus its lines of work.  Urban analysis Kain-style formed the core of a several-year effort and yielded book length publications (see, e.g., G. Ingram, et al., The NBER Urban Simulation Model, Columbia Univ. Press, 1972).  After serving in the Air Force, Kain moved to Harvard, first to redirect the Urban Planning Department.  After a time, he relocated at the Kennedy School, and he, along with José A. Gómez-Ibáñez, John Meyer, and C. Ingram, lead much work in an economic-policy analysis style. Martin Wohl moved on from RAND, eventually, to Carnegie-Mellon University, where he continued his style of work (e.g. Wohl 1984).

==Policy Oriented Gaming ==

The notion that the impact of policy on urban development might be simulated was the theme for a conference at Cornell in the early 1960s; collegiums were formed, several streams of work emerged.  Several persons developed rather simple (from today’s view) simulation games.  Land use development was the outcome of gravitational type forces and the issue faced was that of conflicts between developers and planners when planners intervened in growth.  CLUG and METROPOLIS are two rather well known products from this stream of work (they were the SimCity of their day); there must be twenty or thirty other similar planner vs. developer in the political context games.  There seems to have been little serious attempt to analyze use of these games for policy formulation and decision-making, except for work at the firm Environmetrics.

Peter House, one of the Cornell Conference veterans, established Environmetrics early in the 1960s.  It, too, started with relatively simple gaming ideas.  Over about a ten-year period, the comprehensiveness of gaming devices was gradually improved and, unlike the other gaming approaches, transportation played a role in their formulation.  Environmetrics’ work moved into the Environmental Protection Agency and was continued for a time at the EPA Washington Environmental Studies Center.

A model known as River Basin was generalized to GEM (General Environmental Assessment Model) and then birthed SEAS (Strategic Environmental Assessment Model) and SOS (Son of SEAS).  There was quite a bit of development as the models were generalized, too much to be discussed here.

The most interesting thing to be noted is change in the way the use of the models evolved.  Use shifted from a “playing games” stance to an “evaluate the impact of federal policy” stance.  The model (both equations and data) is viewed as a generalized city or cities.  It responds to the question: What would be the impact of proposed policies on cities?

An example of generalized question answering is LaBelle and Moses (1983) La Belle and Moses implement the UTP process on typical cities to assess the impact of several policies.  There is no mystery why this approach was used.  House had moved from the EPA to the DOE, and the study was prepared for his office.  

== University of North Carolina ==

A group at Chapel Hill, mainly under the leadership of Stuart Chapin, began its work with simple analysis devices somewhat similar to those used in games.  Results include Chapin (1965), Chapin and H. C. Hightower (1966) and Chapin and Weiss (1968). That group subsequently focused on (1) the ways in which individuals make tradeoffs in selecting residential property, (2) the roles of developers and developer decisions in the urban development process, and (3) information about choices obtained from survey research. Lansing and Muller  (1964 and 1967) at the Survey Research Center worked in cooperation with the Chapel Hill Group in developing some of this latter information.

The first work was on simple, probabilistic growth models.  It quickly moved from this style to game-like interviews to investigate preferences for housing.  Persons interviewed would be given “money” and a set of housing attributes – sidewalks, garage, numbers of rooms, lot size, etc.  How do they spend their money? This is an early version of the game The Sims. The work also began to examine developer behavior, as mentioned. (See: Kaiser 1972). 

== Reviews and Surveys ==

In addition to reviews at CUE meetings and sessions at professional meetings, there have been a number of organized efforts to review progress in land use modeling.  An early effort was the May 1965 issue of the Journal of the American Institute of Planners edited by B. Harris.  The next major effort was a Highway Research Board Conference in June, 1967 (HRB 1968) and this was most constructive.  This reference contains a review paper by Lowry, comments by Chapin, Alonso, and others.  Of special interest is Appendix A, which listed several ways that analysis devices had been adapted for use.  Robinson (1972) gives the flavor of urban redevelopment oriented modeling. And there have been critical reviews (e.g. Brewer 1973, Lee 1974).  Pack (1978) addresses agency practice; it reviews four models and a number of case studies of applications.  (See also Zettel and Carll 1962 and Pack and Pack 1977). The discussion above has been limited to models that most affected practice (Lowry) and theory (P-J, etc.) there are a dozen more that are noted in reviews.  Several of those deal with retail and industry location.  There are several that were oriented to urban redevelopment projects where transportation was not at issue.

== Discussion ==

Lowry-derived land use analysis tools reside in the MPOs.  The MPOs also have a considerable data capability including census tapes and programs, land use information of varied quality, and survey experiences and survey-based data.  Although large model work continues, fine detail analysis dominates agency and consultant work in the US. One reason is the requirement for environmental impact statements.  Energy, noise, and air pollution have been of concern, and techniques special to the analysis of these topics have been developed.  Recently, interest has increased in the uses of developer fees and/or other developer transportation related actions.  Perceived shortages for funds for highways and transit are one motive for extracting resources or actions from developers.  There’s also the long-standing ethic that those who occasion costs should pay. Finally, there is a small amount of theoretical or academic work.  Small is the operative word.  There are few researchers and the literature is limited.

The discussion to follow will first emphasize the latter, theory-oriented work.  It will then turn to a renewed interest in planning models in the international arena. Modern behavioral, academic, or theory-based analysis of transportation and land use date from about 1965.  By modern we mean analysis that derives aggregate results from micro behavior.  First models were Herbert-Stevens in character.  Similar to the P-J model, they:

* Treated land as the constraining resource and land use choices given land rent variations as the critical behavior.
* Imagined roles for policy makers.
* Emphasized residential land uses and ignored interdependencies in land uses.
* Used closed system, comparative statics ways of thinking.
* And gave no special attention to transportation.

There have been three major developments subsequently:  
# Consideration of transportation activities and labor and capital inputs in addition to land inputs, 
# Efforts to use dynamic, open system ways of thinking, and 
# Inquiry into how micro choice behavior yields macro results.

The Herbert-Stevens model was not a behavioral model in the sense that it did not try to map from micro to macro behavior.  It did assume rational, maximizing behavior by locators.  But that was attached to macro behavior and policy by assumed some centralized authority that provided subsidies.  Wheaton (1974) and Anderson (1982) modified the Herbert-Stevens approach in different, but fairly simple, ways to deal with the artificiality of the Herbert-Stevens formulation.

An alternative to the P-J, Herbert-Stevens tradition was seeded when Edwin S. Mills, who is known as the father of modern urban economics, took on the problem of scoping more widely. Beginning with Mills (1972), Mills has developed a line of work yielding more publications and follow on work by others, especially his students.  

Using a Manhattan geometry, Mills incorporated a transportation component in his analysis. Homogeneous zones defined by the transportation system were analyzed as positioned x integer steps away from the central zone via the Manhattan geometry.  Mills treated congestion by assigning integer measures to levels of service, and he considered the costs of increasing capacity. To organize flows, Mills assumed a single export facility in the central node.  He allowed capital-land rent trade offs yielding the tallest buildings in the central zones.

Stating this in a rather long but not difficult to understand linear programming format, Mills’ system minimizes land, capital, labor, and congestion costs, subject to a series of constraints on the quantities affecting the system.  One set of these is the exogenously gives vector of export levels. Mills (1974a,b) permitted exports from non-central zones, and other modifications shifted the ways congestion is measured and allowed for more than one mode of transport.  

With respect to activities, Mills introduced an input-output type coefficient for activities; aqrs, denotes land input q per unit of output r using production technique s. T.J. Kim (1979) has followed the Mills tradition through the addition of articulating sectors. The work briefly reviewed above adheres to a closed form, comparative statics manner of thinking.  This note now will turn to dynamics.

The literature gives rather varied statements on what consideration of dynamics means.  Most often, there is the comment that time is considered in an explicit fashion, and analysis becomes dynamic when results are run out over time.  In that sense, the P-J model was a dynamic model.  Sometimes, dynamics are operationalized by allowing things that were assumed static to change with time.  Capital gets attention.  Most of the models of the type discussed previously assume that capital is malleable, and one considers dynamics if capital is taken as durable yet subject to ageing – e.g., a building once built stays there but gets older and less effective.  On the people side, intra-urban migration is considered.  Sometimes too, there is an information context.  Models assume perfect information and foresight.  Let’s relax that assumption.

Anas (1978) is an example of a paper that is “dynamic” because it considers durable capital and limited information about the future.  Residents were mobile; some housing stock was durable (outlying), but central city housing stock was subject to obsolescence and abandonment.

Persons working in other traditions tend to emphasize feedbacks and stability (or the lack of stability) when they think “dynamics,” and there is some literature reflecting those modes of thought.  The best known is Forester (1968), which set off an enormous amount of critique and some follow on thoughtful extensions (e.g., Chen (ed), 1972) 

Robert Crosby in the University Research Office of the US DOT was very much interested in the applications of dynamics to urban analysis, and when the DOT program was active some work was sponsored (Kahn (ed) 1981). The funding for that work ended, and we doubt if any new work was seeded.

The analyses discussed use land rent ideas.  The direct relation between transportation and land rent is assumed, e.g., as per Stevens.  There is some work that takes a less simple view of land rent.  An interesting example is Thrall (1987).  Thrall introduces a consumption theory of land rent that includes income effects; utility is broadly considered.  Thrall manages both to simplify analytic treatment making the theory readily accessible and develop insights about policy and transportation.

Wachs&lt;ref&gt;Wachs, Martin (1994) Keynote Address:  Evolution and Objectives of the Travel Model
Improvement Program in Travel Model Improvement Program Conference Proceedings
August 14-17, 1994, edited by Shunk, Gordon and Bass, Patricia http://ntl.bts.gov/DOCS/443.html &lt;/ref&gt; summarizes Lee's (1973) &quot;Requiem for Large Scale Models.&quot;  &lt;ref&gt;Lee, Douglass (1974) &quot;Requiem for Large Scale Models.&quot; Journal of the American Institute of Planners. 39(3) 163--178&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|
Lee couched his argument, as many of you will recall, in terms of what he called the seven deadly sins of modeling. The seven sins were:
&lt;p&gt;
1) Hypercomprehensiveness:  Meaning that the models tried to replicate too complex a system in a single shot, and were  expected to serve too many different purposes at the same time.
&lt;p&gt;
2) Grossness:  In a way, the converse of hypercomprehensiveness.   Even though they tried to do too much and serve too many  purposes, their results or outputs were too coarse and  aggregate, too simplistic to be useful for complicated and    sophisticated policy requirements.
&lt;p&gt;
3) Data Hungriness:  Even to produce, gross outputs (a few  variables), the models required us to input many variables for   many geographic units, and from at least several time periods in      order to produce approximate projections, and very often we          could not afford the data collection efforts needed to run the models. In other instances, data simply didn't exist at the          levels of specificity which would be appropriate to run them. 
&lt;p&gt;
4) Wrongheadedness:  Lee meant that the models suffered from      substantial and largely unrecognized deviations between the          behavior claimed for them and the variables and equations which      actually determined their behavior.  As an example, when      regional averages were used to calibrate models, but forecasts       were made for local areas, the models deviated from reality      because of specification errors which were often not even      recognized by their users.
&lt;p&gt;
5) Complicatedness:  Even though when you looked at them through one set of lenses the models seemed terribly simplistic, when looked at through another set of lenses they were outrageously      complex.  Too simplistic in replicating urban economic and   social processes, the models were too complex in their      computational algorithms.  Errors were multiplied because   there were so many equations, spatial units, and time periods.  Even the theoretical notion of the model or its representation of    an urban process was grossly simplistic compared with reality.       Often, the user didn't know how the errors were propagated   through  series of sequential operations; and sometimes we needed   to use systematic adjustments or &quot;correction factors&quot; to make the  models more realistic even though we did not completely comprehend the sources of all the errors and could not interpret the  correction  factors in real-world terms.
&lt;p&gt;
6) Mechanicalness: Lee meant that we routinely went through many steps  in a modeling process without completely understanding why we did  so, and without fully comprehending the consequences in terms of     validity or error magnification.  He stated, for example, that even   rounding errors could be compounded beyond reasonable bounds by  mechanical steps taken to calibrate and apply many models without    the user's knowledge.
&lt;p&gt;
7) Expensiveness: The costs of the models, derived from their   grossness, data hungriness, complicatedness, and so on, placed them beyond the financial means of many agencies, or depleted the   resources of agencies so much that the very use of models precluded  having the resources available to improve them or to fine tune them to make them appropriate to their applications.
&lt;p&gt;
Lee argued in 1973 that the models should be improved in four ways:
&lt;p&gt;
1) Models should be made more transparent to users and  policymakers.
&lt;p&gt;
2) Models should combine strong theoretical foundations, objectives     information, and wisdom or good judgment.  Without these elements, they remain exercises in empty-headed empiricism,      abstract theorizing, or false consciousness of what is    actually going on in our urban areas.
&lt;p&gt;
3) We should start with problems and match our methods to the needs of particular situations, gathering no more information and  using no more modeling complexity than is really needed.
&lt;p&gt;
4) We should build the simplest models possible, since complex models do not work well, and certainly are unlikely to be understood by those who are asked to act on the basis of the  model outputs.

John Landis&lt;ref&gt;from PRSCO conference June 2001&lt;/ref&gt;, has responded about seven challenges facing large scale models:
# Models - microbehavioral (actors and agents) ... Social Benefit/Social Action
# Simulation - multiple movies/scenarios
# Respond to constraints and investments
# Nonlinearity - path dependence in non-artifactual way (structure and outcomes, network effects)
# spatial vs. real autocorrelation, emergence - new dynamics, threshold network effects
# preference utility diversity and change over time
# Useful beyond calibration periods.  Embed innovators and norming agents.  Strategic and response function.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Chemistry is the study of composition, structure and properties of matter. This includes studying changes that are observed when undergoing various chemical reactions or understanding the basic structure of complex macromolecules. It provides an understanding for atoms, molecules, crystals which make up everything in this world, while incorporating the concepts of energy and [[Structural Biochemistry/Entropy|entropy]].

==Chemical Foundations of Biochemistry==
[[File:Organicelements.GIF|3d Lewis representation of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and carbon to use as organic building blocks|right|thumb]]
Chemistry is always interconnected with the other sciences, such as astronomy, physics, material science, and biology.  In terms of biochemistry,  it strives to find chemical explanations to biological form and function.  Chemistry shows that all forms of life share common origins through the similarity of various chemical pathways between different organisms.  For example, all living cells have the common molecules of [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Proteins|amino acids]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Carbohydrates|carbohydrates]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Lipids|lipids]], and [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Nucleic Acids (DNA)|nucleic acids]] which all perform the same functions in every cell.

Nature is predominantly made of four elements: Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), Nitrogen (N), and Carbon (C).  Together the make up over 99% of all living cells.  These elements are the lightest atoms that are capable of making up to four stable and strong bonds.  There are other elements that are also essential to living organisms such as Sodium (Na), Potassium (K), Calcium (Ca), and Sulfur (S).  These are called trace elements and usually are needed to help specific proteins to function.&lt;ref&gt;Principles of Biochemistry by Lehninger&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organic Chemistry as the Backbone of Biochemistry===

[[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry|Organic chemistry]] is the study of the structures, properties, synthesis, and reactions of chemical compounds consisting of mainly carbon and hydrogen atoms. It is the backbone science that explains many of the interactions that occur in a cell at the most basic level. The majority of biochemistry, from a chemical point of view, involves the [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding|interactions]] between organic molecules that exist in organisms and how they are utilized in a versatile fashion at a cellular level. The arrangement of bonds within a molecule determines its overall shape, conformation, and the molecules ability to perform specific functions within a cell. Organic compounds that are of particular interest in biochemistry are [[Structural Biochemistry/Carbohydrates|carbohydrates]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid|nucleic acids]], and [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]].

Carbon is unique from the other essential elements for it has the capability to form four stable, covalent bonds and stable double and triple bonds.  Carbon can bond with other carbons to create long chains with or without branches or cyclic structures allowing the formation of an endless array of molecules with different shapes, sizes, and compositions.  Replacing hydrogen with other elements or functional groups gives the organic molecule different properties such as polarity.

==Importance of Chemical Structure==

[[File:Mecoprop-racemic-dimer-from-xtal-labelled-3D-balls.png|thumb|left]]
Biochemistry chemistry is sterospecific meaning that the 3-D orientation of a molecules matters and only specific arrangements will interact properly.  Stereoisomers are molecules that have the same chemical bonds but have a different spatial arrangement.  They may look very similar but they cannot be the same molecule with out breaking any of the covalent bonds.

[[File:Chirality with hands.jpg|Human hands are mirror images of each other just like enantiomers.|thumb|right]]
There are many places where there can be varying spatial configuration.  A molecule can have a chiral center which means that an atom (usually carbon) that is attached to four different substituents.  These four can arrange themselves any way they want to around the carbon but if the arrangements are not exactly the same then they are stereoisomers.  One example is if the molecule is a mirror image of itself.  No matter how you rotate the molecule it will never superimpose on to its original form.  This specific type of stereospecificity is called enantiomers.  If they are not mirror images of each other they are called diastereomers.

Another way is to have a double bond.  Double bonds, unlike single bonds, are stiff and do not rotate freely.  The four substituents that surround the bond can form either trans, where the two highest ranked substituents are opposite sides of the bond, or cis, where the highest ranked are on the same side of the bond, relationships.  This is called either geometric isomers or cis-trans isomers.

While enantiomers have almost the same chemical properties only the specific orientation will have the desired effect in a biological system.  In nature, chiral compounds are usually found in only one orientation.  For example, in carbohydrates the second to last carbon always has a &quot;D&quot; orientation and amino acid's chiral carbon is always in an &quot;L&quot; orientation.  Enzymes can discriminate between enantiomers therefore is essential to have the right configuration.

===Water and its Effects on Structure===
The field of biochemistry also encompasses the special properties of [[Structural Biochemistry/Water|water]]. Because all living organisms have cells that interact with aqueous solutions, the properties of water are fundamental to the environment in which biochemical reactions occur. The structure of a molecule determines whether it is hydrophilic or hydrophobic. Its interaction in water determines how these molecules function in a cell, one example being the lipid bi-layer in the [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Biological Membranes|cell membrane]] and how its chemical properties determines its function in the cell (in this case acting as a barrier in a cell). Water also has unique features such as high boiling and melting points. Its liquid form is also more dense than its solid form which allows marine life. An important feature of water in regards to biochemistry is its ability to form [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrogen bonds|hydrogen bonds]].

==INTRODUCTION==

===What is KiCad?===

KiCad is an open source, multi-platform EDA (Electronic Design Automation) package. It will capture your schematics, build your parts libraries and lay out your PCBs. It runs under Windows, various flavors of Linux and has been ported to the Mac OSX.

===What is the official name for KiCad EDA?===
&quot;The official name I prefer is KiCad&quot;

Jean-Pierre CHARRAS

===How is it pronounced?  Is it &quot;KEY-cad&quot;, &quot;KYE-cad&quot; OR &quot;kay-EYE-cad&quot;?===

===Where can I get KiCad?===

Please look at the [http://www.kicad-pcb.org/display/KICAD/Download+Kicad | Download KiCad] page. There are still some older versions at 
[http://iut-tice.ujf-grenoble.fr/kicad/ Jean-Pierre CHARRAS' KiCad website].

===Where can I find a KiCad tutorial?===

The ''KiCad Tutorial'' can be found in the ''doc'' folder (or the ''tutorial'' folder for older versions) of the installed KiCad tree or in the [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=145591&amp;package_id=160171 kicad-doc] package.

Please look at the English version of the [[Mini_tutorial]].

Renie S. Marquet created a mini tutorial with a simple RS232 adapter on [http://www.reniemarquet.cjb.net/kicad.htm his site]. This is only in Portuguese but, it has many pictures, including the tools to use. Perhaps it will help you.

Renie's tutorial is basic, but covers all steps from zero to creating the schema and pcb.

There is another tutorial available from an enthusiast at [http://kicadhowto.wikidot.com KiCadHowTo.wikidot.com]

===Where can I get the documentation in my native language?===

Please take a look at [[Docs]] page.

===Is this the official KiCad wiki?===
No, this FAQ copied from the Official [http://kicad.sourceforge.net International '''KiCad''' wiki].

[[User:bokeoa|Bryan Stillwell]] originally set up a
[http://kicad.bokeoa.com/wiki/ wiki]
on November 23, 2005 but it has been recently moved to http://kicad.sourceforge.net/ .

===Can I help with KiCad development?===

Of course you can. Here is KiCad developers mailing list:

*[mailto:kicad-developers@lists.launchpad.net Developers]
*[https://launchpad.net/~kicad-developers Developers Archive]

If you're interested in helping out with the programming behind KiCad, join this new group and look at [[Download#You can help with the project! | this page]].

===Why does KiCad try to connect to the internet?===

KiCad does not connect to the internet.  It uses sockets for client-server communications from eeschema to pcbnew.  Some firewalls misinterpret socket access as internet access.

ie.  When you click on a pin in eeschema, the corresponding net is highlighted on the board.


Jean-Pierre CHARRAS


==PROJECT MANAGER==

If my product uses a stack of 2 PCBs, should I put each PCB in its own &quot;project&quot; folder, or put them both in a single &quot;project&quot; folder?

==EESCHEMA==

=== How do I output other netlist formats? ===

Such as the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDIF standard EDIF netlist format]?

eeschema have a NetList plugin system. eeschema creates a generic (intermediate)  NetList output (generic list of components, list of pins and list of nets). The plugin reads this generic file and creates the new NetList format, and eeschema can run automatically this plugin. This plugin is very easy to create because the  generic NetList output is designed to make such a plugin straightforward. A sample is given, with comments to create new plugins. Currently this sample creates a PADS-PCB NetList format. (Note, this format is not very well tested.)

The new eeschema NetList tool had up to 8 user programmables entries to launch these plugins. The first time you use it, you must open the NetList dialog box, open the blank page (the last entry) and :
* give a title (ex: PADS-PCB)
* give the command line to launch the plugin (e.g. ''/usr/lib/kicad/plugins/netlist_form_pads-pcb'' or ''d:/kicad/bin/plugins/netlist_form_pads-pcb.exe'')
* run the NetList generator (like the other formats).

This version is unstable because the user interface may be modified, and the documentation is not yet updated.

If you use this feature, please report any problems.

Another work-around is the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/edif2kicad/ Edif to KiCad translator].

=== How do I copy and paste from one schematic to another? ===

To copy a block from a schematic, open your previous schematic, select the block to copy and in pop-up menu (right click), and choose Save Block (or delete block but DO NOT SAVE YOUR OLD SCHEMATIC).

Within the same window, use the menu to open the new schematic and press the Paste button
(tool bar). The block will be pasted into your new schematic.

To copy components from a schematic, select the components you want to copy/cut using the right mouse button to select copy/paste from the pop up menu, and then press the escape key. That will return the selected components to the starting point. Switch to the other schematic and paste the component.

If you want to copy icons, you must deactivate the &quot;auto pan&quot; option in preference menu.

As an alternate option, you can enter the block command with holding the
shift key (copy) or shift+ctrl keys (delete) ( See doc eeschema 2.2.2)

===How to update a part with new modifications from the library===
There is a bug (in Release: 2006-08-28) that keeps the fields from getting updated - best to delete the part and re-add it at this time if you use fields. 


=== Non-homogeneous multi-part modules? ===

Part-A is the default. Load the part, right click on it, select edit-&gt;unit, and change the part-A to part-X

For  Non-homogeneous multi-part components, do not forget to check (in library editor) the &quot;Parts are Locked&quot; option for these components.With this option, Eeschema does not change the part selection when annotates the schematic.

Jean-Pierre CHARRAS

=== What are Markers in the Locate dialog? ===
Markers are from the ERC - and show where there is an error.

=== How does one import the .stf file into a schematic and what does it do? ===
.stf files are generated by CVPCB (stuff file). It consists of a line for each component, giving the name of the footprint according to its reference. 

Example:

If the U3 component was assigned the footprint 14DIP300, the generated line is
 comp “U3” = module “14DIP300”

In EEschema svn version (r1064) a button was added to back-annotate Footprints from a &quot;Stuff File&quot; to the schematic.

Use case: The process for keeping the schematic up to date would be:

eeschema:
* enter starting schematic
* output initial netlist annotated with ref designators

cvpcb:
* read initial netlist
* add missing footprint info
* output modified netlist &amp; stuff list (with footprint info)

pcbnew:
* the modified netlist could be used to start initial placement
* save working pcb

eeschema:
* back-annotate footprint info from &quot;stuff file&quot;
* modify schematic if desired, maybe change a few footprints
* output updated netlist (containing footprints)

pcbnew:
* import updated netlist with new components, optionally removed unused parts no longer in netlist
* place new components

=== libedit ===
Schematic symbol creation and editing.

===== There are two ways to save the part - one to RAM and the other to the library. What is the use of this? =====

If you save your modifications into RAM, you can go back to your schematics and see the result of it.  If you don't like it, you can still &quot;roll back&quot; to the previous situation.
If you save your part into the library, there's no way back any more.

===== If you change a part in the library - what do you have to do to update a part in a schematic? =====

In fact, it's done automatically for you, when you press the button to save the modified part into RAM.  The only thing which apparently doesn't work yet (release 2006-08-28) is the update of the fields.
But you ''will'' see your modified drawings at least.

===== How do I create a new parts library? =====

In EESchema select the icon &quot;Go to library editor&quot;. It opens with a clear view and Libedit: No Lib header. Then select &quot;New Part&quot; icon ... go through simple questions and you are ready to draw your own part.

Once you've created it - use &quot;Create a new library and save current part into&quot;. Than select location and give a filename. For example, I made my own directory at /home/xtc/kicad/libs_xtc - where I save all my personal lib files.

When You finish editing our part - save and close. Then in EESchema you have to add this new library to library list. You do this in &quot;Preferences &gt; Libs&amp;Dir &gt; ADD (button)&quot; - browse to find your library and it will be added to list. From now on - your part will be visible in place_part dialog list.

=== libbrowse ===

This allows the user to see which parts are contained in each library of schematic symbols. This can speed up the creation of a schematic project by allowing the user to directly load a library and go directly to a specific part. If the part needed can not be found in a library it can be created in LibEdit (described above) or look for libraries on the internet.

=== Power Port in Hierarchical Sheets? global or only local to the specific sheet? ===

A single power flag is used for each power rail. It is global across the design, so you would have one power flag on VCCA for the whole design. A power port is global in that a VCCA port on one sheet is connected to a VCCA port on another sheet.&lt;ref&gt;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/kicad-users/message/14434&lt;/ref&gt;

==CVPCB==
CVPCB is for associating footprints (modules) with schematic parts.

If you create a new component in LibEditor and you immediately assign a footprint to it (Icon &quot;Edit component properties -&gt; Footprint filter -&gt; Add), then CvPcb will automatically filter the footprints.  For example, enter &quot;14*&quot; in Libedit will make CVPCB propose to you 14DIP-ELL30 and 14dip300 (assuming you have selected &quot;Display the filtered footprint list for the current component&quot;).


==PCBNEW==

=== How can I use relative coordinates? ===
Press the SPACE-key at the position where you want your relative coordinates origin.
Now you can read the relative coordinates at the status bar, at the right of the absolute coordinates.

=== How do I manually route a PCB? ===

Manual routing is straight forward. You don't even need to have a schematic. Start a new project then select PcbNew. Right click in the drawing area and select Select Working Layer. Set working layer to edges PCB. Select Line tool from RHS and draw PCB outline.

Now right click and select working layer copper. Select Add Tracks and Vias tool from RHS toolbar. Draw your tracks. You can place a via by pressing the V-key.

To change track size you need to create a new track type. From the main menu select Dimensions then Tracks &amp; Vias. Fill in the values for your new track size and press OK. Your new track type is now in the tracks drop down box.

If you have a schematic then start Pcbnew as normal. Choose the Add Tracks and Vias tool from the RHS toolbar and click on a ratnest. Be sure you are working on the components layer for single sided PCB with SMD components. If you are using default colors all tracks should be red. If you get green tracks, you are working on the copper layer.

See also: [[Manual_Routing_Notes]]

=== How do I unroute a PCB? ===

In Pcbnew select the Edit/Global Deletions menu and in the dialog that
pops up check the 'delete tracks' option then click the Accept button.

=== How do I connect a copper fill to a net? ===

One method is while in the fill zone mode you move the pointer inside
the track, right click and choose &quot;select net&quot;. Then you can do &quot;fill
zone&quot; from anywhere outside the track.

You could also use the 'net highlight' tool. This took me forever to
figure out actually. I would expect some option in the Fill dialog to
select a net to connect to.



=== How I can move SMT components to the solder side ===
With &quot;flip module&quot; in the pop-up menu. You can also press the &quot;F&quot; key to do the same thing.

=== How do I change the grid size inside the library editor? ===

Right click and choose grid select.
 

=== What's the difference between printing and plotting PCB layouts? ===

New in pcbnew, in the print menu, is a new scale option:
&quot;Accurate scale 1&quot;, which prints the board at scale 1.00, but does not keep
exactly the board position in page.
The Approx. scale 1 (old option) keeps the board position in page and is
intended to produce documents for users. The real scale depends on
printer, margins, pcbnew page size and real paper size, and is intended primarily for documentation purposes.

There is also a change in page margin management, both in eeschema and pcbnew. Margins reduce the user drawing area for 0.4 inch (10mm) on left, right, top and bottom sides. In older versions, there was no margin, and the schematic drawings were drawn at reduced scale (smaller than scale 1), to fit in page + margins. In the new version the scale is near scale 1, and the page setup in the print dialog window is removed.

There are two reasons for this:

1 - The  print dialog window page setup option is buggy under Windows
(this is a wxWidget problem, not a KiCad problem). Therefore, the user could not really change the margins values, or the printer paper size.

2 - Boards now can be printed at exact scale 1, and the necessary
margins reduce the user drawing area. (old versions drew the board at nearly 0.95 scale mainly to fit in the usable paper area, which is the paper size - margins).

The margin setup dialog is not currently available (currently, margin values
are hard coded), but i hope i put this feature in a next release of KiCad.

=== How can I print a PCB mirrored? ===

There are two ways to do it:

First, Pcbnew has a mirror option in File/Plot menu (Postscript format).
Secondly, modify the board by the &quot;Flip block&quot; command ( Block command: select the whole board, right click and select flip bock).

=== How do I make PCB mounting holes? ===

A hole can be seen as a footprint, with only one pad. You can add one (or many) footprint (right toolbar, button &quot;add module&quot;)  like the &quot;1pin&quot; footprint existing in library. Edit the pad in order to have the correct size (pad diameter and drill value).

=== How do I make a ground or power plane? ===

*Select Add Zones icon
*Trace the limit of the zone. You do not need this step if you have defined the edges of the board on the edges Pcb layer and if your zone is going to follow these edges.
*Place the cursor on a pad belonging to the net you want for the plane,  (GND or any other)
*Click right on the zone an select fill zone

Note that the pads belonging to this network must already be connected by tracks, else the design rule test will see them not connected. The addition of the zone must therefore be done at the end.

''NOTE: Can anyone explain &quot;You do not need this step if you have defined the edges of the board on the edges Pcb layer and if your zone is going to follow these edges.&quot; any better? Is it really possible to have a zone in PcbNew automatically fill the Pcb Edges? How exactly do you do it?'' &lt;-- It seems you actually still need to trace the limit of the zone if you want the zone to extend to the edge of the PCB but it is sufficient to just draw the zone around the whole PCB. If you have a circular PCB, for example, then you draw a square outside the edges of the PCB limits. Then when you fill the zone only the area inside the PCB edge will be filled.

=== How do I add vias to a zone? ===

To make a via connecting two zones (for instance joining ground or power planes between layers) the via needs to be connected to a net: 

# Select the option 'Add tracks and vias'
# Left click on an existing pad or track in the zone where you want the via. The pad or track should be on the same net as the zone (ie if the zone is a ground plane then choose a nearby ground pin.)
# Click again where you want the via, to create a track.
# Without moving the mouse, right click and select 'Place Via'
# Without moving the mouse, right click again and select 'End Track'

Now you have a via...

The track you created will be covered by the zone, so it serves no actual purpose except to assign the via to a net. It's needed because of an outstanding bug/limitation in Kicad ([https://bugs.launchpad.net/kicad/+bug/593923 bug report]/[https://lists.launchpad.net/kicad-developers/msg07434.html developer discussion]) where unconnected tracks/vias lose their net association after the board is reloaded or DRC is run.

=== How do I rotate a footprint by a specific angle (e.g. 45 degrees)? ===

''Tested with pcbnew SVN r890''

# Right click on the module you want to rotate
# Select ''Footprint ... (Component) -&gt; Edit'' to open the ''Module Properties'' dialog
# Here, in the ''Properties'' tab, select ''User'' in the ''Orient'' section
# Now you can enter an arbitrary angle in the ''Orient (0.1 deg)'' box. You have to multiply your angly by 10, e.g. enter ''450'' for 45°


=== How do I make coils for planar cores? ===

I make Switch Mode Power Supplies. I use a sandwich of two ferrite cores around one ore more PCBs to make a transformer. How do I make make arc tracks and spiral coils ?

=== Does Pcbnew have an autosave facility? ===

This function exists in PCB editor. Better consider buying UPS.

I don't know if it's a good feature since there is no undo-redo
mechanism and conscious saving looks like the only way to go back in editing.

XTC

=== How can I make my own default footprints? ===

A convenient method is to create .equ files and use the automatic association command with cvpcb. This is because for many components, the &quot;standard default footprint&quot; depends on the value. Diodes, Polarized Capacitors are an example. For most of the components you can use an SMD version for a project and later the &quot;standard&quot; version for another project.

With a .equ file you can have a &quot;standard default footprint&quot; which solves this because the .equ files can be specific to a project.

here is an example ( see kicad/modules/devices.equ)
'680K'      'R4'
'1M'    'R4'
'2,2PF'      'C1'
'3,3PF'      'C1'
'74HC00'        '14DIP300'
'74LS00'        '14DIP300'
'74HCT00'         '14DIP300'


* .equ file gives the standard default footprint from the component value and can be created by your favorite editor. The editor replace command can very quickly change the 14DIP300 to SO14E for a SMD based project...

In kicad/modules/ you can find some  .equ files.

Do not forget to configure cvpcb to select the .equ files you want.


=== Why the 3D viewer doesn't  work? ===

You must ensure the color depth of your graphics card is set to 24 or 32 bits.

In Linux you can edit /etc/X11/XF86Config-4

and change the line

DefaultDepth 24


=== Module editor ===

PCBnew also contains the module (foot-print decal) editor where you can change and create modules.

===== There are two default text strings on a new decal; What are they called and what are they for? =====

===== Under Module properties there are attributes (normal, Normal+Insert, and Virtual) what are they for? =====

===== How do I place vias in the module editor? =====
Some packages, such as QFN, require thermal vias in a particular arrangement.
How do I do that with KiCad?

===== What do the different numbers mean in the gridding drop-down. i.e. the &quot;10&quot; in &quot;Grid 10.0&quot; and &quot;100&quot; in &quot;Grid 100.0&quot; =====
By default, KiCad operates in inches (see the I and mm buttons along the lefthand side toolbar to switch to mm). When the grid is set to 100, it is using a spacing of 100 mils, or 100 thousandths of an inch - .1&quot; , at Grid 10, it is .01&quot;. Make sure the grid in your work field is visible by clicking the grid button on the left hand toolbar. 

The Grid 100 spacing of .1&quot; is convenient as .1&quot; is also the spacing for pins of a standard DIP package as well as many other components. The distance between rows is usually .3&quot;. In metric it would be 2.54mm between pins and 7.62mm between rows. Of course there are also variations with different package types.

=== Auto router ===
====How can I force the autorouter to work on only one layer?====

I have discovered I can force the autorouter to work only on the copper side by selecting copper for both layers in the Select Layer Pairs dialog.-

NB: This possibility was inopportunely forgotten in certain versions, but should be restored soon (version of June 2008).

The other way is to first create a keepout area in either one layer and then use autorouter, thus the autorouter will be forced to use only the other copper area for routing.

==== MUCS-PCB Autorouter ====

This is not actually part of kicad - but has been recommended as a better auto router than the one that comes with kicad.

But be aware, that Jean-Pierre Charras, the author of Kicad, [http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/kicad-users/message/14 wrote] in Sep 5, 2005:

: I know this autorouter, and I have written an implementation for pcbnew, but i do not released it.
: This is because unfortunately, there are some problems:
: - Some (many?) bugs.
: - The *main* problem is the router do no know the 45° for tracks and pcb edges. This is very hard to change because the code is *very* optimized to handle only 90° tracks and edges.

: I believe DJ Delories has solved some of theses problems ( mainly for the free software &quot;PCB&quot;), but I do not know this patched version.

=== Steps to Produce Gerber output files ===

== Library maintenance ==

=== Where can I get other component libraries? ===

There is a library folder in the files section of the group for just this purpose. Feel free to create your own sub folders and contribute your work.

=== How do I import libraries from other PCB programs? ===

Eagle

I just uploaded &quot;exp-kicad-lib.ulp&quot; under the rm_sharkey_libs folder in the
files section of the group. This is a ULP script to export EAGLE PCB parts to KiCad. To use, open EAGLE PCB, load the library you're interested in, into the library editor, and then run this ULP script.

It has one bug that I have not gotten around to fix yet (I did not write this script). The bug is in selecting the correct layer for the pads. However, even in it's current state, you can manually edit the KiCad output and touch up the pads using search and replace, just compare with a similar &quot;good&quot; KiCad lib and you'll see what has to be modified. Aside from that, it does a pretty good job of exporting.....maybe if someone has some time they could tweak this script a bit to make it work better.

(Mike Sharkey)

I've wrote a simple script for exporting pcbnew libs from Eagle CAD libraries but don't know what kind of restrictions eagle's librarians apply to their libraries. I've uploaded about 200 converted libs on our ftp server and using them now. Please look at it and say me what are you thinking about. I think it will be good if that libs be available to all KiCad users.

Link: http://www.openhardware.ru/people/dmitri_s/converter/ {{dead link}}

(Dmitri N. Sytov)

==== Large Converted Library ====

A large number of symbols and footprint converted from an Eagle Library can be found:

Link: http://library.oshec.org/  (Download All)

User beware that compatibility with KiCad should to be verified: long pins names, valid file names, geometry, pin assignments, etc

''In particular, KiCad chokes on the &quot;m-pad-2.1.mod&quot; file merely because of its file name. Work-around: rename to &quot;m-pad-2-1.mod&quot;; then that library works fine with KiCad.''

=== How can I generate an array of pads fast? ===

I've uploaded one perl script I made to the yahoo files section.
(jpdborgna folder). I append the readme file of that.

The function of this simple script is to generate pad arrays, the symbol and the module, for using with KiCad. These arrays can be used for pins connectors, for prototyping areas or for any other component which requires many pads uniformly distributed. Given the simplicity it can be easily modified to make other functions.

== Import Methods ==

=== PCB ===
* [http://sourceforge.net/projects/xml4pcb XML4PCB - PCB123 XML out to KiCad's pcbnew converter]


== ECO ==


=== What are the steps involved in making a change ([[Circuit_board_CAD_Terms#ECO | ECO]]) in a design?===
There is more going on that just creating a new netlist and importing it -:
the .stf file may be involved - how are changes to the footprint handled? This dosn't quite work as documented in (2006-08-28)

Is there a forward and backward eco process going on? Is there inter process communication going on between eeschema and pcbnew? I read that there was - but what is it doing?

==MISCELLANEOUS==

===Links to other KiCad related sites.===

I created a page on my site about KiCad in Portuguese Brazil (sorry!
my English is poor!) named Espaço KiCad!

Have tricks in use of KiCad and many components:

  - 162 new 3D components

  - 21 new modules (footprint)

  - 8 new components for eeschema.

Yours visits will be welcome!

http://www.reniemarquet.cjb.net

Ktechlab (http://ktechlab.org/)

This program is in the very early stages of development, but it would fit in nicely with KiCad. It provides a schematic capture, simulation and code creation IDE for microcontroller projects. It seems to be written in C++, but doesn't use wxWidgets. It uses SDCC (small device C compiler) as it expands the range of microcontrollers that can be used.

===Posting Guidelines===

The group is very young so there is as yet no group policy for posting guidelines., However, as a start I recommend we adopt the standard netiquette guidelines in Section 3 of RFC 1855 which can be found here:

Where is the submission link?
Is it best to submit the additions/changes individually, or to integrate them into the appropriate pre-existing library?

=== How do I draw schematic dotted lines? ===

How do I draw dotted lines on the schematic page?
How do draw dotted lines in a schematic symbol in a library?

The &quot;place graphic lines or polygons&quot; tool in the right toolbar
appears to be dotted.
I can change the color of all lines drawn with that tool using
Preferences &gt;&gt; Colors &gt;&gt; Notes.

But all the lines it draws are solid -- do you really expect me to draw hundreds of individual little dashes?

The KiCad project is open source. Feel free to add &quot;dotted&quot; line styles to the &quot;graphic polyline&quot; tool.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here is a summary for the primary structure of a protein:
I.	Primary Structure:
1.	It is a sequence of amino acids.
2.	It is a linear polymer: linking the alpha-cacboxyl group of one amino acid to the alpha amino group of another amino acid =&gt; PEPTIDE BOND (covalent bond).
3.	In some proteins, the linear polypeptide chain is cross-linked: Disulfide bonds.

The primary structure is a polypeptide, in which:
      + each amino acid in the peptide is a residue. 
      + there is a regularly repeating segment called the main chain or backbone,and a variable part, comprised of the side chain.

==Primary Structure==

The primary structure of a protein is a linear polymer with a series of [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]]. These amino acids are connected by C-N bonds, also known as [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Important Organic Reactions in Biochemistry/Peptide Bonding|peptide bonds]]. The formation of peptide bonds produce [[Structural Biochemistry/Water|water]] molecules as a by-product when an amino terminal residue (N-terminal) loses an oxygen from the alpha-carboxyl group while the other amino acid loses two of its hydrogens from its alpha-amino group. Thus, polypeptide, or polypeptide chain, is a term that describes the multiple connected peptide bonds between numerous amino acids. Each amino acid in a polypeptide chain is a unit, commonly known as a '''residue'''. These chains have a planar backbone, as the peptide bonds have double bond characteristics due to the existence of resonance between the [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Organic Functional Group/Carbonyl|carbonyl]] carbon and the nitrogen where the peptide bonds form. The primary structure of each protein has been precisely determined by the specific genes. The C-N bond in an amino acids chain has the character of a double bond. This bond has a short length and stable. It cannot be rotated. This double-bond character can be explained structurally, in that the R groups in amino acid chains avoid steric clash.

Amino acids are linked by peptide bonds to form polypeptide chain; each amino acid unit is known as a residue; a polypeptide chain constructed by the same unit is known as the main chain or backbone and a changing R group, side chains.

=== Forces that stabilize Protein Structure ===
Protein structures are governed primarily by hydrophobic effects and by interactions between polar residues and other types of bonds. The hydrophobic effect is the major determination of original [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]] structure. The aggregation of nonpolar side chains in the interior of a protein is favored by the increase in [[Structural Biochemistry/Entropy|Entropy]] of the water molecules that would otherwise form cages around the hydrophobic groups. Hydrophobic side chains give a good indication as to which portions of a polypeptide chain are inside, out of contact with the aqueous solvent. 
Hydrogen bonding is a central feature in protein structure but only make minor contributions to protein stability. Hydrogen bonds fine tune the tertiary structure by selecting the unique structure of a protein from among a relatively small number of hydrophobically stabilized conformations. 
Disulfide bonding can form within and between polypeptide chains as proteins fold to its native conformation. Metal ions may also function to internally cross link proteins.

===Factors that cause denaturing ===
1)Temperature

2) pH

Extreme temperatures will result in the unfolding of a polypeptide chain leading to a change in structure and often a loss of function. If the protein functioned as an enzyme denaturing will cause that protein to lose its enzymatic activity. As the temperature of a solution containing the protein is raised, the extra heat causes twisting and bending of bonds. As proteins begin to denature the secondary structure of the protein is lost and adopts a random coil configuration. Covalent interaction between amino acid side chains such as disulfide bonds are also lost.

At high or low pH levels the protein will denature due to the lose or gain of a proton and, therefore, will lose their charge or become charged, depending on which way the pH is changed and by how much. This will eliminate many of the ionic interactions that were necessary for maintenance of the folded shape of the protein. As a result the change in structure will cause a change or loss of function.

=== Determination of Primary Structure: Amino Acid Sequencing ===

After the polypeptide has been purified, the composition of the polypeptide should be established. To determine which amino acid and how much of each is present, the entire strand is degreaded by amide hydrolysis (6N HCl, 110&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;C, 24hr) to produce a mixture of all free amino acid residues. The mixture is separated and its composition recorded by amino acid analyzer. The amino acid analyzer establishes the composition of a polypeptide by giving a chromatogram, which records the peaks of each amino acid presents in the sequence. However, the amino acid analyzer can only give the composition of a polypeptide, not the order in which the amino acids are bound to one another.

To determine the amino acid sequence, it usually starts from the determination of the amino terminal of the polypeptide. The procedure is known as Edman degradation, and the reagent employed is phenyl isothiocyanate.

[[Image:phenyliso.jpg|thumb|Phenyl isothiocyanate]]

In Edman degradation, the terminal amino group adds to the isothiocyanate reagent to produce a thiourea derivative. Treating with mild acid, the tagged amino acid is turned into a phenylthiohydantoin, and the remainder of polypeptide is unchanged. Since the phenylthiohydantoins of all amino acid are known, the amino terminal of the original polypeptide can be identified easily. However, Edman degradation can only be used to identify the amino end of the polypeptides; therefore, for polypeptides that are made up by hundreds of amino acids, it is not a practical method in general. In addition, multiple degradation rounds will build up impurities which will seriously affect the yield of peptide. High yield means not completely quantitative, and with each step of degradation, incompletely reacted peptide will mix with the new peptide, resulting in a intractable mixture.

[[File:Aasequencedirection**.png]]

In other words, secondary structure refers to the spatial arrangement of amino acid residues that are nearby in the sequence. The alpha helix, and beta strands are elements of secondary structure.
==Secondary Structure==

Secondary structures of proteins are typically very regular in their conformation. They are the spacial arrangements of primary structures. Alpha Helices and Beta Pleated Sheets are two types of regular structures. An interesting bit of information is that certain amino acids making up the polypeptide will actually prefer certain folding structures. The Alpha Helix seems to be the default but due to interactions such as sterics, certain amino acids will prefer to fold into Beta pleated sheets and so on. For example, amino acids such as Valine, Isoleucine, and Threonine all have branching at the beta carbon, this will cause steric clashes in an alpha helix arrangement. Glycine is the smallest amino acid and can fit into all structures so it does not favor the helix formation in particular. Therefore, these amino acids are mostly found where their side chains can fit nicely into the beta configuration.  

The structure of polypeptide main chains is mostly of hydrogen-bonding; each residue has a carbonyl group that is a good hydrogen- bond acceptor; nitrogen- hydrogen group, a good hydrogen- bond donor.

===Alpha Helix===
====Structure====

The general physical properties of an alpha helix are:

[[Image:Helix 1.png‎|thumb|Alpha helix project outward in helical array]]

[[Image:Helix 2.png‎|thumb|Ribbon displaying the backbone of the alpha helix]]

*3.6 residues per turn
*Translation (rise) of 1.5 A
*Rotation of 100 degrees
*Pitch (or height) of 5.4A (1.5A*3.6 residues)

[[Image:Hydrogen bond.png|thumb|Alpha helix with hydrogen bonds]]

*Screw sense = clockwise (usually) because it would be less sterically hindered
*Inside the helix consist of the coiled backbone and the side chains project outward in helical array
*Hydrogen bonding between the 1st carbonyl to the hydrogen on the 5th amino
*The shorthand drawing of the alpha helix is a ribbon or rod

[[Image:Helix ribbon.png‎|thumb|Ribbon shorthand notation for the alpha helix]]

[[Image:alpha helix.JPG‎|thumb|Ramachandran diagram]]

*Alpha helix falls within quadrant 1  (left-handed helix) and 3 (right-handed helix) in the Ramachandran diagram

====Supersecondary Structure of Alpha Helix====
=====[[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Fibrous Proteins|Fibrous Proteins]]=====
I. COILED-COIL (α-keratin)

An alpha coiled coil consists of two or more alpha helices intertwined, creating a stable structure.  This structure provides support to tissues and cell, contributing to the cell cytoskeleton and muscle proteins such as myosin and tropomyosin.  Alpha keratin consists of heptad repeats (imperfect repeats of 7 amino acid sequences).  This facilitates bonding between the two or more helices.

II. COLLAGEN

Collagen is another type of fibrous protein that consists of three helical polypeptide chains.  It is the most abundant protein found in mammals, making up a large component of skin, bone, tendon, cartilage, and teeth.  Wrinkles are also caused by the degradations of this protein.  In the structure of collagen, every third residue in the polypeptide is glycine because it is the only residue that is small enough to fit in the interior position of the superhelical cable.  Unlike normal alpha helices, each collagen helix is stabilized by steric repulsion of the pyrrolidine rings of the praline and hydroxyproline residues.  However, the three strands intertwined are stabilized by [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrogen bonds|hydrogen bonding]].

====Alpha Tertiary====
I. MOTIFS

Motifs are simple combinations of the secondary structure such as the helix-turn-helix, which consist of two helices separated by a turn.  The helix-turn-helix motif are usually found in [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]]-binding proteins.

II.  DOMAINS (GLOBULAR)

Domains, or compact globulars, consist of multiple motifs.They are polypeptide chains folded into two or more compact regions connected by turns or loops.  Their structure is spherical, which is beneficial for the protein because it conserves space.  Generally, inside the globular protein consist of hydrophobic amino acids such as leucine, valine, methionine, and phenylalanine.  The outside consists of amino acids with hydrophilic tendencies such as aspartate, glutamate, lysine, and arginine.  An example of a globular protein is myoglobin, which is the oxygen carrier in muscle.  It is an extremely compact molecule made of only alpha helices (70%) except for loops and turns (30%).

====Transmembrane and Non-Transmembrane Hydrophobic Helix====
Studying the topography of transmembrane and non-transmembrane helix have helped answer many questions about membrane protein insertion. Specifically, studying the sequence and lipid dependence of the topography provide insights into post-translational topography changes. Furthermore, studying topography has lead to the design of hydrophobic helices that have biomedical applications. For example, a tumor marker called pHLIP peptide has been designed.

Different tests have been used to show the various effects on the hydrophobic helices. For example, hydrophilic residues such as tryptophan and tyrosine destabilize the transmembrane state. The hydrophilic domains cannot cross the membrane so it blocks any transmembrane and non-transmembrane equilibration. Furthermore, charged ionized residues also destabilize the transmembrane state. Stabilization of the transmembrane is also achieved in helix-helix interaction. Moreover, anionic lipids promote membrane binding of hydrophobic peptides and proteins.

Alpha helices, beta strands, and turns are formed by a regular pattern of hydrogen bonds between the peptide N-H and C=O groups of amino acids that are NEAR ONE ANOTHER IN THE LINEAR SEQUENCE.  Such folded segments are called secondary structure. 

'''====Summary====
The alpha-helix consists of a single polypeptide chain in which the amino group (N-H) hydrogen bonds to a carboxyl group (C=O) 4 residues away. The alpha - helix is a rod-like structure. The tightly coiled backbone of the chain forms the inner part of the rod and the side chains extend outward in a helical array. This results in a clockwise coiled structure, which is known as a &quot;right handed&quot; screw sense. This folding pattern, along with the beta-pleated sheets were actually proposed by Linus Pauling and Robert Corey half a decade before people could actually see it. Most of the alpha strands are located in the lower left corner or upper right corner of the Ramachandran diagram . Essentially, most of the alpha helices are found in the right-hand helices area. An alpha helix is especially suited for cross-membrane proteins because all of the amino hydrogen and carbonyl oxygen atoms of the peptide backbone can interact to form intrachain hydrogen bonds while its aliphatic side chains can stabilize in hydrophobic environment of cell membrane.

Alanine, leucine and glutamic acid (existed as glutamate as physiological pH) are the most common residues present in alpha-helices.

The alpha-helix content of protein ranges widely, from none to almost 100%.

In general, the alpha helix is the &quot;normal&quot; shape of a polypeptide chain; however, features of certain amino acids disrupt alpha helix formation and instead favor beta strand formation.  Amino acids with branching at the beta carbon (i.e. valine, threonine, and isoleucine) are problematic because they crowd the peptide backbone.  H-bond accepting/donating groups attached to the beta carbon (i.e. serine, asparagine, and aspartate) can bond with backbone amine and carboxyl groups, again interfering with alpha helix formation. 

While individual amino acids may favor one form or another, predicting the 2° structure of even a short (&lt;7 amino acid) peptide strand is only 60-70% accurate. Such variability suggests other factors, like tertiary interactions with amino acids further down the chain, influence the folding into its observed 3° structure.

Beta-strand is: 
1.	It is around ʊ = 120 and ϕ = -120
2.	You have the angle, and you form the zigzag. The zigzag have the distance between amino acids is 3.5 Angstron

===Beta Pleated Sheet===

In contrast to the alpha helical structure, Beta Sheets are multiple strands of polypeptides connected to each other through hydrogen bonding in a sheet-like array. Hydrogen bonding occurs between the NH and CO groups between two different strands and '''not within one strand''', as is the case for an alpha helical structure.  Due to its often rippled or pleated appearance, this secondary structure conformation has been characterized as the beta pleated sheet. The beta strands can be arranged in a parallel, anti-parallel, or mixed (parallel and anti-parallel) manner. 

[[Image:Anti-parallel Beta Sheet.JPG|thumb|Anti-parallel Beta Strand]]

The anti-parallel configuration is the simplest. The N and C terminals of adjacent polypeptide strands are opposite to one another, meaning the N terminal of one peptide chain is aligned with the C terminal of an adjacent chain. In the anti-parallel configuration, each amino acid is bonded linearly to an amino acid in the adjacent chain. 

[[Image:Parallel Beta Strand.jpg|thumb|Parallel Beta Strand]]

The parallel arrangement occurs when neighboring polypeptide chains run in the same direction, meaning the N and C terminals of the peptide chains align. As a result, an amino acid cannot bond directly to the complementary amino acid in an adjacent chain as in the anti-parallel configuration. Instead, the amino group from one chain is bonded to a carbonyl group on the adjacent chain.  The carbonyl group from the initial chain then hydrogen bonds to an amino group two residues ahead on the adjacent chain.  The distortion of the hydrogen bonds in the parallel configuration affects the strength of the hydrogen bond because hydrogen bonds are strongest when they are planar. Therefore, due to this distortion of hydrogen bonds, parallel beta sheets are not as stable as anti-parallel beta sheet (exp: formation of parallel beta sheet with less than 5 residues is very uncommon). 

The side chains of beta strands are arranged alternately on opposite sides of the strand. The distance between amino acids in a beta strand is 3.5A which is longer in comparison to the 1.5A distance in alpha strands. Because of this, beta sheets are more flexible than alpha helices and can be flat and somewhat twisted. The average length of beta sheets in a protein is 6 amino acid residues. The actual length ranges from 2 to 22 residues. 

[[Image:Ramachandran Plot.jpg|thumb|Ramachandran Plot: Beta strands are found in the purple region]]

Beta sheets are graphically found in the upper left quadrant of a Ramachandran plot.  This corresponds to ψ angles of 0 to 180 and Φ angles of -180 to 0.

[[Image:The schematic model of beta sheets.JPG‎|thumb|The schematic model of beta sheets]]

Visual representations in 3D models for beta sheets are traditionally denoted by a flat arrow pointing in the direction of the strand.

Loop is everything, but what is alpha helix and beta-strand does. It is related to SECONDARY structure of protein.

===Turn and Loop===

Polypeptide chains can change direction by making reverse turns and loops.  Alpha helices and beta strands are connected by these turns and loops.  Most proteins have compact, globular shape owing to reversals in the direction of their polypeptide chains, which allows the polypeptide to create folds back onto itself. In many reverse turns, the CO group of residue i of a polypeptide is hydrogen bonded to the NH group of residue i+3. A turn helps to stabilize abrupt directional changes in the polypeptide chain.  Loops are more elaborate chain reversal structures that are rigid and well defined. Loops and turns generally lie on the surfaces of proteins so they often participate in interactions between proteins and other molecules. In a loop, there are no regular structures as can be found in helices or beta strands.

Two hypotheses have been proposed for the role of turns in [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Protein Folding|protein folding]]. In one view, turns play a critical role in folding by bringing together interactions between regular secondary structure elements. This view is supported by mutagenesis studies indicating a critical role for particular residues in the turns of some proteins. Also, nonnative isomers of X-Proline peptide bonds in turns can completely block the conformational folding of some proteins. In the opposing view, turns play a passive role in folding. This view is supported by the poor amino-acid conservation observed in most turns. Also, non-native isomers of many X-Pro peptide bonds in turns have little or no effect on folding.

===Beta Hairpin Turns===

A motif is when secondary structure elements combine in specific geometric arrangements. Beta hairpin turns are one type of arrangement; they are one of the simplest structures and then are found in globular proteins. Upon turning, the antiparallel strand can bind effectively through hydrogen bonding between the carbonyl carbon and the peptide backbone nitrogen. It has been shown that 70% of beta-hairpins are less than  seven residues long; the majority being 2 residues long. There are two types of two-residue beta hairpin turns. The first, Type I, forms a left-handed alpha-helical conformation. This left-handed conformation has a positive phi angle due to the properties of the aforementioned amino acids. Glycine does not have a side chain to sterically interfere with the turned amino acid sequence. Asparagine and aspartate both readily form hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen as a hydrogen bond acceptor. The second amino acid in the Type I turn is usually glycine due to steric hindrance that would result using any amino acid with a side chain. In a Type II beta hairpin turn, the first residue can only be glycine due to steric hindrance. However, the second residue is usually polar, such as serine or threonine.

===Fibrous proteins===
Fibrous protein such as alpha-keratin and collagen consist of two right handed alpha helix intertwined to form a type of left handed super-helix called an alpha coiled coil. 
The two helices in this type of protein usually cross-linked by weak interaction such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Van der Waals interaction|Van der Waals forces]] force and [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Ionic interaction|ionic]] interaction. The side chain interaction can be repeat every seven residues, forming heptad repeats. Another form of fibrous protein, that of collagen, exists as three helical polypeptide chains. These chains are relatively long, ~1000 residues, and because of overcrowding, glycine appears once every three residues. While the helix is stabilized by the steric repulsions, the three strands are stabilized by hydrogen bonding.
These protein usually serve structural roles in organisms, alpha-keratin is commonly found in the cytoskeleton of a cell, as well as certain muscle proteins. Collagen is often found in teeth, skin, and tendons.

===Secondary Structure Prediction===
The science of predicting what polypeptide chain will conform to which secondary structure group (alpha-helix, beta-sheet/strand or turns/loops) is not particularly exact. However, various frequencies of secondary structure formation of certain amino acids have been recorded in actual scientific experimentation, and these values can allow scientists to predict the folding of a protein based on its amino acid composition with about 60-70% accuracy. Stretches of six or less residues can usually be predicted with this accuracy. Although, certain amino acids tend to fold in its preferred conformation, there are of course exceptions and so secondary structure prediction is not always accurate. Tertiary interactions, interactions with residues further apart from each other, can also determine the folding structures. Each amino acid has a preference for either secondary structure, but it normally is only a small preference towards one in comparison to another, therefore, this unfortunately does not mean much. Amino acids can appear in an alpha-helix in one protein and also in a beta-sheet in another. Due to the unpredictability of the secondary structure based on the sequence of amino acids, secondary structures are being analyzed and predicted in relations to a similar family of sequences.  

Various techniques have risen throughout history in the study of secondary structural prediction. With the aid of computers, prediction has been a pursued research topic in bioinformatics and many approaches continue to be proposed. After Linus Pauling and Robert Corey discovered the periodic alpha helix and beta sheet structures within proteins in 1951, further elucidation of protein structure prediction began to grow. A major method in secondary structure prediction was the [[w:Chou-Fasman method|Chou-Fasman method]]; it yielded a 50-60% accuracy. This method based its predictions on assigning a set of prediction values to a certain amino acid residue and then applied an algorithm to that value. Shortly after, further improvements were made on this method, the [[w:GOR method|GOR method]], which was developed in the late 1970s and utilized [[w:|information theory|entropy and information concepts]] for secondary structure prediction. When devised, the method was about 65% accurate, however, improvements have also been made to it. There are deductive techniques in which similar sequences are found in already identified proteins. This method is accomplished by having computer software search databases of identified proteins. Opposite of that would be the ''Ab initio'' method, which builds 3-dimensional models without looking at similar residue sequences. This method is based on hydrogen bonding principals and localization. 

Other methods and factors of folding prediction include analyzing the basic chemical tendencies of the side chains of amino acids to determine its preference in secondary structure. The alpha-helix is taken as the default structure, thus amino acids that destabilize alpha-helices are often found in beta-pleated sheets or loops and turns. For instance, valine, threonine, and isoleucine will often destabilize the helix because of branching of the beta carbon. These three amino acid residues are more often found in beta-pleated sheets, where their side chains will lie in a separate plane than the main chain. There are also amino acid residues that prefer neither alpha-helices nor beta-pleated sheets, for example, Proline has a restricted phi angle of ~60 degrees and no NH group, all due to the fact that it is cyclic. This will disrupt both alpha-helices and beta-pleated sheets, thus is found mostly in loops and turns. A counter-intuitive example is glycine which, according to its small size, theoretically can fit in any structure easily, but in reality it tends to avoid alpha-helices and beta-sheets also. The folding definitely also relies on chemical interactions between the side chains so the surrounding amino group interactions also affect the tendency of folding. These tendencies are reflected in the frequencies of secondary structure for individual amino acids.

The relative tendencies of secondary structures for particular amino acids are listed below:

alpha-helix:     Glu, Ala, Leu, Met, Lys, Arg, Gln, His

beta-sheet:      Val, Ile, Tyr, Cys, Trp, Phe, Thr

turns and loops: Gly, Asn, Asp, Pro, Ser

====Torsion Angles====
Torsion angles are also called dihedral angles. The torsion angle is the measure in degrees in bonds between atoms. Folding of proteins are influenced by the degree of rotation amino bonds can hold. There are two different types of torsion angles existing in polypeptide bonds. ''Psi, ψ'' is the angle between the α-carbon and the nitrogen atom of a peptide bond. The other bond is called ''phi, φ'' which is the angle between the α-carbon and the carbonyl group. To measure φ, one must look from the nitrogen atom towards the α-carbon to measure if the angle is negative or positive. The angle is negative if the α-carbon rotates counterclockwise and vice versa. Furthermore, to measure ψ, one must look from the nitrogen atom towards the carbonyl group. Likewise, the angle is negative if the carbonyl group rotates counterclockwise and vice versa.

====Ramachandran Diagram====
The Ramachandran Diagram, created by Gopalasamudram Ramachandran, helps to determine if amino acids will form alpha helices, beta strands, loops or turns.  The Ramachandran Diagram is separated into four quadrants, with angle ϕ as the x axis and angle ψ as the y axis.  The combinations of torsion angles will put the amino acids in specific quadrants, which determine whether it will form an alpha helix, beta strand, loop, or turn.  Those that fall in quadrants 1 and 3 a few times in a row form alpha helices, and those that repeat in quadrant 2 form beta strands.  Quadrant 4 is generally disfavored because of steric hindrance.  Also, it is mostly impossible because the different torsion angles combinations in quadrant 4 can't exist because they cause collisions between the atoms of the amino acids.  If the amino acids land in the different quadrants, with no repeats, then they become loops or turns. Furthermore, the principle of steric exclusion states that two atoms cannot occupy the same place simultaneously.

MYOGLOBIN is one of example of tetriary structrue. It is oxygen carrier in muscle is a single polypeptide chain of 153 amino acids. The capacity of myoglobin to bind oxygen depends on the presence of HEME, a nonpolypeptide PROSTHETIC group consisting of protoporhyrin IX and a central iron atom. Myoglobin is an extremely compact molecule. 

==Tertiary Structure==

The tertiary structure of a protein is the three-dimensional structure of the protein. This three-dimensional structure is mostly determined by the amino acid sequence, which is denoted by the primary structure of the protein, however the amino acid sequence cannot entirely predict on how the three-dimensional structure is formed. Another contributing factor to the final shape of the tertiary structure is based on the environment in which the protein is synthesized. The tertiary structure is stabilized by the sequence of hydrophobic amino acid residues in the backbone of the protein. The interior consists on hydrophobic side chains while the surface consists of hydrophilic amino acids that interact with the aqueous environment.

Tertiary structure is formed by interactions between side chains of various amino acids - in particular disulfide bonds formed between to cysteine groups. At this stage, some proteins are complete, while other proteins incorporate multiple polypeptides subunits which creates the quaternary structure. 

Nucleation-condensation model- The tertiary folding process is very structured with key intermediates. When a protein starts to fold, localized areas of the protein first begin folding. Then, the individual localized folds come together to complete the tertiary structure. The key concept is that when a correct fold is achieved, that fold is retained until all other parts of the protein are also correctly folded. This folding process follows reason because a random trial and error folding process would not only take much more time to complete, but also would require much more input energy.

Tertiary structure refers to the spatial arrangement of amino acid residues that are far apart in the sequence and to the pattern of disulfide bonds. Tertiary structure is also the most important protein structure that is used in determining the enzymatic activity of proteins. 

=== Structure ===

[[Image:Lobster1.jpg|thumb|A lobster's exoskeleton is an example of keratin.]]
[[Image:Alfie.jpg|thumb|A dog's fur is also an example of keratin.]]
Cysteine, an amino acid containing a thiol group, is responsible for the disulfide bonds that hold a tertiary structure together. In the tertiary structure, when two helices come together, they may be linked by these disulfide bonds. A tertiary structure with fewer disulfide bonds form less rigid structures that are flexible, but still strong and can resist breakage such as hair and wool. While tertiary structures that contain more crossed disulfide bonds, formed by cysteine residues, lead to stronger, stiffer and harder structures such has exoskeletons. Others examples of protein that contain more disulfide bonds include claws, nails, and horns.

A structure made of two a-helices such as keratin can be found in living organisms. Immunoglobulin, also known as [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein function/Antibodies|antibodies]], is an example of an all beta-sheet protein fold. It consists of approximately 7 anti-parallel beta-strands arranged in 2 beta-sheets. For instance, if a cysteine is mutated to another amino acid it can code to a different protein which would lead to incorrect folding.

=== Domains ===
Some polypeptide chains fold into several compact regions. These regions in a polypeptide chain are called domains and generally range from 30 to 400 amino acids. On average, domains contain roughly 100 amino acids.  Each domain forms its own tertiary structure which contributes to the overall tertiary structure of the protein. These domains are independently stable.  Stabilization is caused by metal ions or disulfide bridges that cause the folding of polypeptide chains. Different proteins may have the same domains even if the overall tertiary structure is different.

There are four types of domains:

*All-α domains - Domains made purely from α-helices.

*All-β domains - Domains made purely from β-sheets.

*α+β domains - Domains made both of α-helices and β-sheets.

*α/β domains - Domains made from both α-helices and β-sheets layered in a β,α,β fashion with a α-helix sandwiched in between 2 β-sheets.

=== Mutations ===

In order for a protein to be functional (except in food), it must have an intact tertiary structure. If a tertiary structure of a protein is disrupted, it is said to be denatured. Once a protein is denatured, it will not be able to perform its intended or original function. A primary cause for an alteration of the tertiary structure is a mutation in the gene encoding a protein. The mutation in the gene can cause a domino effect that will lead to the degradation of the tertiary structure. Degradation can cause several diseases, one of which is called cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is brought about by a mutation of a [[Structural Biochemistry/Genetic code|genes]] called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). This disease causes the exocrine glands to overproduce mucus. Most commonly, CF patients suffer from lung failure by the age of early 20-30. Diabetes insipidus, familial, hypercholesterolemia, and Osteogenesis imperfecta are also diseases that originate from degraded proteins. A mutation in the tertiary structure itself, rather than from a mutation in the nucleotide sequence can also lead to diseases. Such mutated proteins can also aggregate and become insoluble deposits called amyloids, and therefore lose the ability to function. A common mutation is when a hydrophobic R group folds in, rather than out, in a hydrophobic environment. The inherited form of Alzheimer's disease is one disease that is caused by mutated tertiary structure. Another disease is &quot;mad cow&quot; disease, which is caused due to a-helix (which are soluble) mutating into b-sheets (which are insoluble and cause amyloid deposits).

=== Folding ===

The folding of a protein is dependent on the amino acid sequence laid out in the primary structure. It is also dependent on the environment in which the folding occurs. In a hydrophobic environment, the hydrophobic side chains of the amino acids of the protein fold out while the hydrophilic side chains fold in and vice versa for a hydrophilic environment. An example of a protein that is folded in a hydrophobic environment is Porin. Its hydrophilic side chains are folded in which creates a channel for water to pass through. Amino acids that have nonpolar/hydrophobic side chains such as leucine, valine, methionine, phenylalanine, and isoleucine would be folded out in the folding of the protein in a hydrophobic environment. Likewise, in a hydrophilic environment, amino acids with polar side chains such as glutamine and asparagine fold outwards and the hydrophobic side chains would fold inwards.

=== Determination of Tertiary Structure ===

The tertiary structure of a protein is determined through [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/X-ray Crystallography|X-Ray Crystallography]] and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ([[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/NMR Spectroscopy|NMR]]) Spectroscopy. X-ray Crystallography was the first method used to determine the structure of proteins.  X-ray crystallography is one of the best methods because the wavelength of an x-ray is similar to that of covalent bonds found throughout proteins, creating a clearer visualization of a molecule's structure. The scattering of x-rays by electrons is analyzed to determine the structure of proteins.  In order to use x-ray crystallography, the protein in question must be in crystal form. Some proteins crystallize readily, while others do not. For those proteins that do not crystallize readily, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy must be used to determine its structure. NMR spectroscopy uses the spin of nuclei with a magnetic dipole and chemical shifts to determine a molecule’s relative position.

Hemoglobin is one of example of quaternary structure. 
HEMOGLOBIN: the oxygen-carrying protein in blood, consists of two subunits of one type (designated alpha) and two subunits of another (designated beta).

==Quaternary Structure==
[[Image:10 large subunit.gif|px 160‎|thumb|Atomic structure of the 50S Subunit from Haloarcula marismortui. Proteins are shown in blue and the two RNA strands in orange and yellow.[11] This is an example of the tertiary structure of the large unit of a ribosome]]

A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_structure quaternary structure] refers to two or more [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypeptide_chains polypeptide chains] held together by intermolecular interactions to form a multi-subunit complex. The interactions that hold together these folded protein molecules include disulfide bridges, [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrogen bonds|hydrogen bonding]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrogen bonds|hydrogen bonding]] interactions, [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrophobic interaction|hydrophobic interactions]] interactions and London forces. These forces are usually conveyed by the side chains of the peptides. 

These polypeptide chains are the subunits of a protein, capable of taking part in a variety of functions such as serving as '''enzymatic catalysts''', providing structural support in the '''cytoskeletons''' of cells, and even composing the hair on our heads.

The peptides of the [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]] can be identical or different. '''Insulin''' is a dimer consisting of two identical peptides, while [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|'''Hemoglobin''']] is a tetramer consisting of two identical alpha subunits and two identical beta subunits.

===Naming Quaternary Structures===
In naming quaternary structures, the number of subunits (tertiary structure) and the suffix -mer (Greek for &quot;part, subunit&quot;)are used: 
*1 subunit = [[w:Monomer|Monomer]]
*2 subunits = [[w:Dimer|Dimer]]
*3 subunits = Trimer (These are sometimes viewed as cyclic trimers. For example: aliphatic and cyanic acids)
*4 subunits = Tetramer
The pattern continues with pent-, hex-, hept-, oct-, and so forth.

===Dimers===
[[Image:InsulinHexamer.jpg|thumb|Computer-generated image of insulin hexamers highlighting the threefold symmetry, the zinc ions holding it together, and the [[w:Histidine|histidine]] residues involved in zinc binding.]]

*&lt;u&gt;'''Insulin'''&lt;/u&gt;
**Dimer – alpha chain and beta chain
**Linked by 2 disulfide bridges
*&lt;u&gt;'''HIV Protease&lt;/u&gt;'''
**Dimer
**Composed of identical subunits

===Trimer===
*&lt;u&gt;'''Collagen&lt;/u&gt;'''
**Composed of 3 helical polypeptide chains
**'''Glycine''' appears at every third residue because there is no space in center of the helix
**Stabilized by steric repulsion of the pyrrolidine rings of the proline and hydroxylproline residues
**'''Hydrogen bonds''' hold together the strands of the collagen fibers

===Tetramer===

From [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Data_Bank PDB] [http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1GZX 1GZX] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteopedia Proteopedia] [http://proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/Hemoglobin Hemoglobin]]]

*'''&lt;u&gt;Hemoglobin'''&lt;/u&gt;
**Consists of 2 alpha and 2 beta groups
**Has a globular shape
**Has reverse turns that contribute to circular shape of the protein
*'''&lt;u&gt;Aquaporin'''&lt;/u&gt;
**Made of 6 alpha helices
**Form hydrophobic loops
**Forms tetramers in the cell membrane with each monomer acting as water channels

===Breaking Apart the Quaternary Structure===
The quaternary structure of a protein can be denatured by breaking the [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Covalent bonds|covalent]] and non-covalent forces that keep it together. Heat, '''urea''' or '''guanidinium chloride''' will '''denature a protein''' by disrupting the '''non-covalent forces''', while &lt;u&gt;beta-mercaptoethanol&lt;/u&gt; will break &lt;u&gt;disulfide bridges&lt;/u&gt; by reducing the bridges.

===Protein Folding===

[[Image:Protein Folding 2.JPG|thumb|A protein is never &quot;half folded&quot;, at the point where the concentration of the denaturant is in between that of the folded and unfolded form of the protein, there are two structures that exist. Folded and Unfolded, at a ratio of 1:1]]

Proteins are either folded, or not. There '''does not exist''' a stage where a protein is &quot;'''half-folded'''&quot;. This can be observed by slowly adding denaturant to a protein. This will result in a '''sharp transition''', from the folded state to the unfolded state, suggesting there only exist these two forms. This is a result of '''cooperative transition'''. 

For instance, if a protein is put in a denaturant where only one part of the protein is unstable, '''the entire protein will unfold'''. This is due to the domino effect where '''destabilizing one part''' of the protein will in turn '''destabilize the remainder of the structure'''. When a protein is in conditions which correspond to the middle of the transition between folded and unfolded, there is a '''50/50''' mixture of folded and unfolded protein, instead of 'half-folded' protein. 

After all is said about being in one structure or the other, there must be something in between them on an atomic level. Unfortunately, this is an area that is still under development, and much research is still being done. Theories such as the condensation Nucleation Principle are concerned with this area of protein folding.

The properties of quaternary structure are: 
1.	Polypeptide chains can assemble into multisubunit structure.
2.	It refers to the spatial arrangement of subunits and the nature of their interactions.

===Analogy===
If one takes each '''student''' in a class to be a different '''amino acid''', each &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;right hand&lt;/font&gt; to be an &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;alpha-carboxyl&lt;/font&gt; group, each &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;left hand&lt;/font&gt; to be an &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;alpha-amino&lt;/font&gt; group, and the &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;head&lt;/font&gt; to be the &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;R group&lt;/font&gt;; then by joining right hands to left hands, the class will form a '''polypeptide'''. The &quot;bonds&quot; joining the hands will be [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Important Organic Reactions in Biochemistry/Peptide Bonding|peptide bonds]]. 
This can be considered the &lt;u&gt;primary structure&lt;/u&gt; of a protein. 

If one then takes students and &quot;attract&quot; them to other students 4 &quot;bonds&quot; away, this structure will then fold into a &lt;u&gt;secondary structure&lt;/u&gt;; namely the '''alpha-helix'''. If the students were put into lines and were attracted to respective students in another line, they would form a '''beta-pleated sheet'''.

Now imagine that the heads, or R groups, vary in areas such as personalities, or polarity, like will attract like. The people who are more compatible will then gather together, for instance, '''hydrophobic''' areas will usually gather together in the center while surrounded by '''hydrophilic''' areas. This makes up the &lt;u&gt;tertiary structure&lt;/u&gt;.

Now add in a different class, the people from the new class would have their own tertiary structure, these new people will then come in and react with the original class to form &lt;u&gt;quaternary structures&lt;/u&gt;.

===Human attempt to manipulate protein assemblies (Quaternary Structures)===
Controlling the quaternary structures is currently catching more and more interest in academics. There are many advantages in manipulating protein assemblies. Firstly, people are able to grow/synthesize enzymes that are beneficial to human. Yet, to get these enzymes to work is the hard part. For example, nitrogenase, the enzyme that can fix nitrogen gas to yield ammonia, can only work under aerobic environment and coupled with ATP as energy source. In addition, researchers have revealed that nitrogenase is compose of two proteins, one for ATP coupling&amp;electron source and the other is the reactive center for nitrogen fixation. The two protein assemble to work as a whole. Recently, scientists remove the ATP coupling protein and replace it with a Ruthenium complex. It turned out that Ruthenium complex can provide electrons with light exposure. Now scientists don't have to deal with the complicate chemistry of coupling ATP, but just shine lights on engineered nitrogenase to get it work! Secondly, protein assemblies can have a lot of clinical/material applications. Ferritin is a family of high-order protein assembly family, usually 12mers or 24mers. Previous researches showed it can absorb large amount of Fe ion. Many researchers are working to control the association and disassociation of Ferritins, seeking for solutions of drug delivery, gas storage, metal harvest and etc. Many approaches have been developed to control protein assembling. Following are some of them.

1. Transition metal-directed. Metal centers in protein are important, not only because they are reactive centers, but also they help stabilize the shape of protein by coordination. Many amino acids are ligands by themselves. Cysteine, Histidine, lysine are the common ones. Plus, researchers can engineer inorganic ligands onto proteins by cysteine substitution. Thus, introducing inorganic ligands much broaden the horizon of protein assemblies.
[[Image:phen.jpg|thumb|the structure of Phenanthroline (inorganic ligand).]]
[[Image:terpy.jpg|thumb|the structure of Terpyridine (inorganic ligand).]]
Metal-ligand bonding has several properties. Most obviously, it is a strong interaction. It is stronger than hydrogen bond and weaker than colvant bond. Therefore metal-ligand bond is strong yet not so strong that it is still reversible. Spatially speaking, metals have its coordination orientation, mostly, octahedral and tetrahedral. This property provides human great convenience in arranging proteins spatially. 
[[Image:bisterpy.jpg|thumb|shown is the cartoon model of a dimer of two terpyridine-labeled proteins.]]

[[Image:triphen.jpg|thumb|shown is the cartoon model of a trimer of three phenanthroline-labeled proteins.]]

2. Hydrophobic interaction. In aqueous environment, amino acid with hydrophobic side chains tend to aggregate together to minimize the exposure to water. Researchers utilize this character and engineer certain matching pair of non-polar amino acids onto proteins to obtain protein oligomers in water solution.

3. Salt bridges. It is well known that amino acids have different pI's. So at certain pH, some amino acids are negatively charged, some are positively charged. If an area on a protein is occupied by mostly negatively charged amino acid and another area is occupied by positively charged amino acids, proteins can aggregate by electrostatic attraction. However, this technique is usually not so selective.

More technique to direct protein assemblies are being investigated, such as coiled-coil. Human's ability to control quaternary structures is promising.

==Federalist No. 71==
Federalist No. 71 is titled ''&quot;The Duration in Office of the Executive&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton.

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''DURATION in office has been mentioned as the second requisite to the energy of the Executive authority. This has relation to two objects: to the personal firmness of the executive magistrate, in the employment of his constitutional powers; and to the stability of the system of administration which may have been adopted under his auspices. With regard to the first, it must be evident, that the longer the duration in office, the greater will be the probability of obtaining so important an advantage. It is a general principle of human nature, that a man will be interested in whatever he possesses, in proportion to the firmness or precariousness of the tenure by which he holds it; will be less attached to what he holds by a momentary or uncertain title, than to what he enjoys by a durable or certain title; and, of course, will be willing to risk more for the sake of the one, than for the sake of the other. This remark is not less applicable to a political privilege, or honor, or trust, than to any article of ordinary property. The inference from it is, that a man acting in the capacity of chief magistrate, under a consciousness that in a very short time he MUST lay down his office, will be apt to feel himself too little interested in it to hazard any material censure or perplexity, from the independent exertion of his powers, or from encountering the ill-humors, however transient, which may happen to prevail, either in a considerable part of the society itself, or even in a predominant faction in the legislative body. If the case should only be, that he MIGHT lay it down, unless continued by a new choice, and if he should be desirous of being continued, his wishes, conspiring with his fears, would tend still more powerfully to corrupt his integrity, or debase his fortitude. In either case, feebleness and irresolution must be the characteristics of the station.''

''There are some who would be inclined to regard the servile pliancy of the Executive to a prevailing current, either in the community or in the legislature, as its best recommendation. But such men entertain very crude notions, as well of the purposes for which government was instituted, as of the true means by which the public happiness may be promoted. The republican principle demands that the deliberate sense of the community should govern the conduct of those to whom they intrust the management of their affairs; but it does not require an unqualified complaisance to every sudden breeze of passion, or to every transient impulse which the people may receive from the arts of men, who flatter their prejudices to betray their interests. It is a just observation, that the people commonly INTEND the PUBLIC GOOD. This often applies to their very errors. But their good sense would despise the adulator who should pretend that they always REASON RIGHT about the MEANS of promoting it. They know from experience that they sometimes err; and the wonder is that they so seldom err as they do, beset, as they continually are, by the wiles of parasites and sycophants, by the snares of the ambitious, the avaricious, the desperate, by the artifices of men who possess their confidence more than they deserve it, and of those who seek to possess rather than to deserve it. When occasions present themselves, in which the interests of the people are at variance with their inclinations, it is the duty of the persons whom they have appointed to be the guardians of those interests, to withstand the temporary delusion, in order to give them time and opportunity for more cool and sedate reflection. Instances might be cited in which a conduct of this kind has saved the people from very fatal consequences of their own mistakes, and has procured lasting monuments of their gratitude to the men who had courage and magnanimity enough to serve them at the peril of their displeasure.''

''But however inclined we might be to insist upon an unbounded complaisance in the Executive to the inclinations of the people, we can with no propriety contend for a like complaisance to the humors of the legislature. The latter may sometimes stand in opposition to the former, and at other times the people may be entirely neutral. In either supposition, it is certainly desirable that the Executive should be in a situation to dare to act his own opinion with vigor and decision.''

''The same rule which teaches the propriety of a partition between the various branches of power, teaches us likewise that this partition ought to be so contrived as to render the one independent of the other. To what purpose separate the executive or the judiciary from the legislative, if both the executive and the judiciary are so constituted as to be at the absolute devotion of the legislative? Such a separation must be merely nominal, and incapable of producing the ends for which it was established. It is one thing to be subordinate to the laws, and another to be dependent on the legislative body. The first comports with, the last violates, the fundamental principles of good government; and, whatever may be the forms of the Constitution, unites all power in the same hands. The tendency of the legislative authority to absorb every other, has been fully displayed and illustrated by examples in some preceding numbers. In governments purely republican, this tendency is almost irresistible. The representatives of the people, in a popular assembly, seem sometimes to fancy that they are the people themselves, and betray strong symptoms of impatience and disgust at the least sign of opposition from any other quarter; as if the exercise of its rights, by either the executive or judiciary, were a breach of their privilege and an outrage to their dignity. They often appear disposed to exert an imperious control over the other departments; and as they commonly have the people on their side, they always act with such momentum as to make it very difficult for the other members of the government to maintain the balance of the Constitution.''

''It may perhaps be asked, how the shortness of the duration in office can affect the independence of the Executive on the legislature, unless the one were possessed of the power of appointing or displacing the other. One answer to this inquiry may be drawn from the principle already remarked that is, from the slender interest a man is apt to take in a short-lived advantage, and the little inducement it affords him to expose himself, on account of it, to any considerable inconvenience or hazard. Another answer, perhaps more obvious, though not more conclusive, will result from the consideration of the influence of the legislative body over the people; which might be employed to prevent the re-election of a man who, by an upright resistance to any sinister project of that body, should have made himself obnoxious to its resentment.''

''It may be asked also, whether a duration of four years would answer the end proposed; and if it would not, whether a less period, which would at least be recommended by greater security against ambitious designs, would not, for that reason, be preferable to a longer period, which was, at the same time, too short for the purpose of inspiring the desired firmness and independence of the magistrate.''

''It cannot be affirmed, that a duration of four years, or any other limited duration, would completely answer the end proposed; but it would contribute towards it in a degree which would have a material influence upon the spirit and character of the government. Between the commencement and termination of such a period, there would always be a considerable interval, in which the prospect of annihilation would be sufficiently remote, not to have an improper effect upon the conduct of a man indued with a tolerable portion of fortitude; and in which he might reasonably promise himself, that there would be time enough before it arrived, to make the community sensible of the propriety of the measures he might incline to pursue. Though it be probable that, as he approached the moment when the public were, by a new election, to signify their sense of his conduct, his confidence, and with it his firmness, would decline; yet both the one and the other would derive support from the opportunities which his previous continuance in the station had afforded him, of establishing himself in the esteem and good-will of his constituents. He might, then, hazard with safety, in proportion to the proofs he had given of his wisdom and integrity, and to the title he had acquired to the respect and attachment of his fellow-citizens. As, on the one hand, a duration of four years will contribute to the firmness of the Executive in a sufficient degree to render it a very valuable ingredient in the composition; so, on the other, it is not enough to justify any alarm for the public liberty. If a British House of Commons, from the most feeble beginnings, FROM THE MERE POWER OF ASSENTING OR DISAGREEING TO THE IMPOSITION OF A NEW TAX, have, by rapid strides, reduced the prerogatives of the crown and the privileges of the nobility within the limits they conceived to be compatible with the principles of a free government, while they raised themselves to the rank and consequence of a coequal branch of the legislature; if they have been able, in one instance, to abolish both the royalty and the aristocracy, and to overturn all the ancient establishments, as well in the Church as State; if they have been able, on a recent occasion, to make the monarch tremble at the prospect of an innovation attempted by them, what would be to be feared from an elective magistrate of four years' duration, with the confined authorities of a President of the United States? What, but that he might be unequal to the task which the Constitution assigns him? I shall only add, that if his duration be such as to leave a doubt of his firmness, that doubt is inconsistent with a jealousy of his encroachments.''

''To the People of the State of New York:''

''THE administration of government, in its largest sense, comprehends all the operations of the body politic, whether legislative, executive, or judiciary; but in its most usual, and perhaps its most precise signification. it is limited to executive details, and falls peculiarly within the province of the executive department. The actual conduct of foreign negotiations, the preparatory plans of finance, the application and disbursement of the public moneys in conformity to the general appropriations of the legislature, the arrangement of the army and navy, the directions of the operations of war, these, and other matters of a like nature, constitute what seems to be most properly understood by the administration of government. The persons, therefore, to whose immediate management these different matters are committed, ought to be considered as the assistants or deputies of the chief magistrate, and on this account, they ought to derive their offices from his appointment, at least from his nomination, and ought to be subject to his superintendence. This view of the subject will at once suggest to us the intimate connection between the duration of the executive magistrate in office and the stability of the system of administration. To reverse and undo what has been done by a predecessor, is very often considered by a successor as the best proof he can give of his own capacity and desert; and in addition to this propensity, where the alteration has been the result of public choice, the person substituted is warranted in supposing that the dismission of his predecessor has proceeded from a dislike to his measures; and that the less he resembles him, the more he will recommend himself to the favor of his constituents. These considerations, and the influence of personal confidences and attachments, would be likely to induce every new President to promote a change of men to fill the subordinate stations; and these causes together could not fail to occasion a disgraceful and ruinous mutability in the administration of the government.''

''With a positive duration of considerable extent, I connect the circumstance of re-eligibility. The first is necessary to give to the officer himself the inclination and the resolution to act his part well, and to the community time and leisure to observe the tendency of his measures, and thence to form an experimental estimate of their merits. The last is necessary to enable the people, when they see reason to approve of his conduct, to continue him in his station, in order to prolong the utility of his talents and virtues, and to secure to the government the advantage of permanency in a wise system of administration.''

''Nothing appears more plausible at first sight, nor more ill-founded upon close inspection, than a scheme which in relation to the present point has had some respectable advocates, I mean that of continuing the chief magistrate in office for a certain time, and then excluding him from it, either for a limited period or forever after. This exclusion, whether temporary or perpetual, would have nearly the same effects, and these effects would be for the most part rather pernicious than salutary.''

''One ill effect of the exclusion would be a diminution of the inducements to good behavior. There are few men who would not feel much less zeal in the discharge of a duty when they were conscious that the advantages of the station with which it was connected must be relinquished at a determinate period, than when they were permitted to entertain a hope of OBTAINING, by MERITING, a continuance of them. This position will not be disputed so long as it is admitted that the desire of reward is one of the strongest incentives of human conduct; or that the best security for the fidelity of mankind is to make their interests coincide with their duty. Even the love of fame, the ruling passion of the noblest minds, which would prompt a man to plan and undertake extensive and arduous enterprises for the public benefit, requiring considerable time to mature and perfect them, if he could flatter himself with the prospect of being allowed to finish what he had begun, would, on the contrary, deter him from the undertaking, when he foresaw that he must quit the scene before he could accomplish the work, and must commit that, together with his own reputation, to hands which might be unequal or unfriendly to the task. The most to be expected from the generality of men, in such a situation, is the negative merit of not doing harm, instead of the positive merit of doing good.''

''Another ill effect of the exclusion would be the temptation to sordid views, to peculation, and, in some instances, to usurpation. An avaricious man, who might happen to fill the office, looking forward to a time when he must at all events yield up the emoluments he enjoyed, would feel a propensity, not easy to be resisted by such a man, to make the best use of the opportunity he enjoyed while it lasted, and might not scruple to have recourse to the most corrupt expedients to make the harvest as abundant as it was transitory; though the same man, probably, with a different prospect before him, might content himself with the regular perquisites of his situation, and might even be unwilling to risk the consequences of an abuse of his opportunities. His avarice might be a guard upon his avarice. Add to this that the same man might be vain or ambitious, as well as avaricious. And if he could expect to prolong his honors by his good conduct, he might hesitate to sacrifice his appetite for them to his appetite for gain. But with the prospect before him of approaching an inevitable annihilation, his avarice would be likely to get the victory over his caution, his vanity, or his ambition.''

''An ambitious man, too, when he found himself seated on the summit of his country's honors, when he looked forward to the time at which he must descend from the exalted eminence for ever, and reflected that no exertion of merit on his part could save him from the unwelcome reverse; such a man, in such a situation, would be much more violently tempted to embrace a favorable conjuncture for attempting the prolongation of his power, at every personal hazard, than if he had the probability of answering the same end by doing his duty.''

''Would it promote the peace of the community, or the stability of the government to have half a dozen men who had had credit enough to be raised to the seat of the supreme magistracy, wandering among the people like discontented ghosts, and sighing for a place which they were destined never more to possess?''

''A third ill effect of the exclusion would be, the depriving the community of the advantage of the experience gained by the chief magistrate in the exercise of his office. That experience is the parent of wisdom, is an adage the truth of which is recognized by the wisest as well as the simplest of mankind. What more desirable or more essential than this quality in the governors of nations? Where more desirable or more essential than in the first magistrate of a nation? Can it be wise to put this desirable and essential quality under the ban of the Constitution, and to declare that the moment it is acquired, its possessor shall be compelled to abandon the station in which it was acquired, and to which it is adapted? This, nevertheless, is the precise import of all those regulations which exclude men from serving their country, by the choice of their fellow citizens, after they have by a course of service fitted themselves for doing it with a greater degree of utility.''

''A fourth ill effect of the exclusion would be the banishing men from stations in which, in certain emergencies of the state, their presence might be of the greatest moment to the public interest or safety. There is no nation which has not, at one period or another, experienced an absolute necessity of the services of particular men in particular situations; perhaps it would not be too strong to say, to the preservation of its political existence. How unwise, therefore, must be every such self-denying ordinance as serves to prohibit a nation from making use of its own citizens in the manner best suited to its exigencies and circumstances! Without supposing the personal essentiality of the man, it is evident that a change of the chief magistrate, at the breaking out of a war, or at any similar crisis, for another, even of equal merit, would at all times be detrimental to the community, inasmuch as it would substitute inexperience to experience, and would tend to unhinge and set afloat the already settled train of the administration.''

''A fifth ill effect of the exclusion would be, that it would operate as a constitutional interdiction of stability in the administration. By NECESSITATING a change of men, in the first office of the nation, it would necessitate a mutability of measures. It is not generally to be expected, that men will vary and measures remain uniform. The contrary is the usual course of things. And we need not be apprehensive that there will be too much stability, while there is even the option of changing; nor need we desire to prohibit the people from continuing their confidence where they think it may be safely placed, and where, by constancy on their part, they may obviate the fatal inconveniences of fluctuating councils and a variable policy.''

''These are some of the disadvantages which would flow from the principle of exclusion. They apply most forcibly to the scheme of a perpetual exclusion; but when we consider that even a partial exclusion would always render the readmission of the person a remote and precarious object, the observations which have been made will apply nearly as fully to one case as to the other.''

''What are the advantages promised to counterbalance these disadvantages? They are represented to be: 1st, greater independence in the magistrate; 2d, greater security to the people. Unless the exclusion be perpetual, there will be no pretense to infer the first advantage. But even in that case, may he have no object beyond his present station, to which he may sacrifice his independence? May he have no connections, no friends, for whom he may sacrifice it? May he not be less willing by a firm conduct, to make personal enemies, when he acts under the impression that a time is fast approaching, on the arrival of which he not only MAY, but MUST, be exposed to their resentments, upon an equal, perhaps upon an inferior, footing? It is not an easy point to determine whether his independence would be most promoted or impaired by such an arrangement.''

''As to the second supposed advantage, there is still greater reason to entertain doubts concerning it. If the exclusion were to be perpetual, a man of irregular ambition, of whom alone there could be reason in any case to entertain apprehension, would, with infinite reluctance, yield to the necessity of taking his leave forever of a post in which his passion for power and pre-eminence had acquired the force of habit. And if he had been fortunate or adroit enough to conciliate the good-will of the people, he might induce them to consider as a very odious and unjustifiable restraint upon themselves, a provision which was calculated to debar them of the right of giving a fresh proof of their attachment to a favorite. There may be conceived circumstances in which this disgust of the people, seconding the thwarted ambition of such a favorite, might occasion greater danger to liberty, than could ever reasonably be dreaded from the possibility of a perpetuation in office, by the voluntary suffrages of the community, exercising a constitutional privilege.''

''There is an excess of refinement in the idea of disabling the people to continue in office men who had entitled themselves, in their opinion, to approbation and confidence; the advantages of which are at best speculative and equivocal, and are overbalanced by disadvantages far more certain and decisive.''

==Federalist No. 73==
Federalist No. 73 is titled ''&quot;The Provision For The Support of the Executive, and the Veto Power&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton.

===Text===
To the People of the State of New York:''

''THE third ingredient towards constituting the vigor of the executive authority, is an adequate provision for its support. It is evident that, without proper attention to this article, the separation of the executive from the legislative department would be merely nominal and nugatory. The legislature, with a discretionary power over the salary and emoluments of the Chief Magistrate, could render him as obsequious to their will as they might think proper to make him. They might, in most cases, either reduce him by famine, or tempt him by largesses, to surrender at discretion his judgment to their inclinations. These expressions, taken in all the latitude of the terms, would no doubt convey more than is intended. There are men who could neither be distressed nor won into a sacrifice of their duty; but this stern virtue is the growth of few soils; and in the main it will be found that a power over a man's support is a power over his will. If it were necessary to confirm so plain a truth by facts, examples would not be wanting, even in this country, of the intimidation or seduction of the Executive by the terrors or allurements of the pecuniary arrangements of the legislative body.''

''It is not easy, therefore, to commend too highly the judicious attention which has been paid to this subject in the proposed Constitution. It is there provided that &quot;The President of the United States shall, at stated times, receive for his services a compensation WHICH SHALL NEITHER BE INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED DURING THE PERIOD FOR WHICH HE SHALL HAVE BEEN ELECTED; and he SHALL NOT RECEIVE WITHIN THAT PERIOD ANY OTHER EMOLUMENT from the United States, or any of them.&quot; It is impossible to imagine any provision which would have been more eligible than this. The legislature, on the appointment of a President, is once for all to declare what shall be the compensation for his services during the time for which he shall have been elected. This done, they will have no power to alter it, either by increase or diminution, till a new period of service by a new election commences. They can neither weaken his fortitude by operating on his necessities, nor corrupt his integrity by appealing to his avarice. Neither the Union, nor any of its members, will be at liberty to give, nor will he be at liberty to receive, any other emolument than that which may have been determined by the first act. He can, of course, have no pecuniary inducement to renounce or desert the independence intended for him by the Constitution.''

''The last of the requisites to energy, which have been enumerated, are competent powers. Let us proceed to consider those which are proposed to be vested in the President of the United States.''

''The first thing that offers itself to our observation, is the qualified negative of the President upon the acts or resolutions of the two houses of the legislature; or, in other words, his power of returning all bills with objections, to have the effect of preventing their becoming laws, unless they should afterwards be ratified by two thirds of each of the component members of the legislative body.''

''The propensity of the legislative department to intrude upon the rights, and to absorb the powers, of the other departments, has been already suggested and repeated; the insufficiency of a mere parchment delineation of the boundaries of each, has also been remarked upon; and the necessity of furnishing each with constitutional arms for its own defense, has been inferred and proved. From these clear and indubitable principles results the propriety of a negative, either absolute or qualified, in the Executive, upon the acts of the legislative branches. Without the one or the other, the former would be absolutely unable to defend himself against the depredations of the latter. He might gradually be stripped of his authorities by successive resolutions, or annihilated by a single vote. And in the one mode or the other, the legislative and executive powers might speedily come to be blended in the same hands. If even no propensity had ever discovered itself in the legislative body to invade the rights of the Executive, the rules of just reasoning and theoretic propriety would of themselves teach us, that the one ought not to be left to the mercy of the other, but ought to possess a constitutional and effectual power of self defense.''

''But the power in question has a further use. It not only serves as a shield to the Executive, but it furnishes an additional security against the enaction of improper laws. It establishes a salutary check upon the legislative body, calculated to guard the community against the effects of faction, precipitancy, or of any impulse unfriendly to the public good, which may happen to influence a majority of that body.''

''The propriety of a negative has, upon some occasions, been combated by an observation, that it was not to be presumed a single man would possess more virtue and wisdom than a number of men; and that unless this presumption should be entertained, it would be improper to give the executive magistrate any species of control over the legislative body.''

''But this observation, when examined, will appear rather specious than solid. The propriety of the thing does not turn upon the supposition of superior wisdom or virtue in the Executive, but upon the supposition that the legislature will not be infallible; that the love of power may sometimes betray it into a disposition to encroach upon the rights of other members of the government; that a spirit of faction may sometimes pervert its deliberations; that impressions of the moment may sometimes hurry it into measures which itself, on maturer reflection, would condemn. The primary inducement to conferring the power in question upon the Executive is, to enable him to defend himself; the secondary one is to increase the chances in favor of the community against the passing of bad laws, through haste, inadvertence, or design. The oftener the measure is brought under examination, the greater the diversity in the situations of those who are to examine it, the less must be the danger of those errors which flow from want of due deliberation, or of those missteps which proceed from the contagion of some common passion or interest. It is far less probable, that culpable views of any kind should infect all the parts of the government at the same moment and in relation to the same object, than that they should by turns govern and mislead every one of them.''

''It may perhaps be said that the power of preventing bad laws includes that of preventing good ones; and may be used to the one purpose as well as to the other. But this objection will have little weight with those who can properly estimate the mischiefs of that inconstancy and mutability in the laws, which form the greatest blemish in the character and genius of our governments. They will consider every institution calculated to restrain the excess of law-making, and to keep things in the same state in which they happen to be at any given period, as much more likely to do good than harm; because it is favorable to greater stability in the system of legislation. The injury which may possibly be done by defeating a few good laws, will be amply compensated by the advantage of preventing a number of bad ones.''

''Nor is this all. The superior weight and influence of the legislative body in a free government, and the hazard to the Executive in a trial of strength with that body, afford a satisfactory security that the negative would generally be employed with great caution; and there would oftener be room for a charge of timidity than of rashness in the exercise of it. A king of Great Britain, with all his train of sovereign attributes, and with all the influence he draws from a thousand sources, would, at this day, hesitate to put a negative upon the joint resolutions of the two houses of Parliament. He would not fail to exert the utmost resources of that influence to strangle a measure disagreeable to him, in its progress to the throne, to avoid being reduced to the dilemma of permitting it to take effect, or of risking the displeasure of the nation by an opposition to the sense of the legislative body. Nor is it probable, that he would ultimately venture to exert his prerogatives, but in a case of manifest propriety, or extreme necessity. All well-informed men in that kingdom will accede to the justness of this remark. A very considerable period has elapsed since the negative of the crown has been exercised.''

''If a magistrate so powerful and so well fortified as a British monarch, would have scruples about the exercise of the power under consideration, how much greater caution may be reasonably expected in a President of the United States, clothed for the short period of four years with the executive authority of a government wholly and purely republican?''

''It is evident that there would be greater danger of his not using his power when necessary, than of his using it too often, or too much. An argument, indeed, against its expediency, has been drawn from this very source. It has been represented, on this account, as a power odious in appearance, useless in practice. But it will not follow, that because it might be rarely exercised, it would never be exercised. In the case for which it is chiefly designed, that of an immediate attack upon the constitutional rights of the Executive, or in a case in which the public good was evidently and palpably sacrificed, a man of tolerable firmness would avail himself of his constitutional means of defense, and would listen to the admonitions of duty and responsibility. In the former supposition, his fortitude would be stimulated by his immediate interest in the power of his office; in the latter, by the probability of the sanction of his constituents, who, though they would naturally incline to the legislative body in a doubtful case, would hardly suffer their partiality to delude them in a very plain case. I speak now with an eye to a magistrate possessing only a common share of firmness. There are men who, under any circumstances, will have the courage to do their duty at every hazard.''

''But the convention have pursued a mean in this business, which will both facilitate the exercise of the power vested in this respect in the executive magistrate, and make its efficacy to depend on the sense of a considerable part of the legislative body. Instead of an absolute negative, it is proposed to give the Executive the qualified negative already described. This is a power which would be much more readily exercised than the other. A man who might be afraid to defeat a law by his single VETO, might not scruple to return it for reconsideration; subject to being finally rejected only in the event of more than one third of each house concurring in the sufficiency of his objections. He would be encouraged by the reflection, that if his opposition should prevail, it would embark in it a very respectable proportion of the legislative body, whose influence would be united with his in supporting the propriety of his conduct in the public opinion. A direct and categorical negative has something in the appearance of it more harsh, and more apt to irritate, than the mere suggestion of argumentative objections to be approved or disapproved by those to whom they are addressed. In proportion as it would be less apt to offend, it would be more apt to be exercised; and for this very reason, it may in practice be found more effectual. It is to be hoped that it will not often happen that improper views will govern so large a proportion as two thirds of both branches of the legislature at the same time; and this, too, in spite of the counterposing weight of the Executive. It is at any rate far less probable that this should be the case, than that such views should taint the resolutions and conduct of a bare majority. A power of this nature in the Executive, will often have a silent and unperceived, though forcible, operation. When men, engaged in unjustifiable pursuits, are aware that obstructions may come from a quarter which they cannot control, they will often be restrained by the bare apprehension of opposition, from doing what they would with eagerness rush into, if no such external impediments were to be feared.''

''This qualified negative, as has been elsewhere remarked, is in this State vested in a council, consisting of the governor, with the chancellor and judges of the Supreme Court, or any two of them. It has been freely employed upon a variety of occasions, and frequently with success. And its utility has become so apparent, that persons who, in compiling the Constitution, were violent opposers of it, have from experience become its declared admirers.''

''I have in another place remarked, that the convention, in the formation of this part of their plan, had departed from the model of the constitution of this State, in favor of that of Massachusetts. Two strong reasons may be imagined for this preference. One is that the judges, who are to be the interpreters of the law, might receive an improper bias, from having given a previous opinion in their revisionary capacities; the other is that by being often associated with the Executive, they might be induced to embark too far in the political views of that magistrate, and thus a dangerous combination might by degrees be cemented between the executive and judiciary departments. It is impossible to keep the judges too distinct from every other avocation than that of expounding the laws. It is peculiarly dangerous to place them in a situation to be either corrupted or influenced by the Executive.''

Federalist No. 74 is titled ''&quot;The Command of the Military and Naval Forces, and the Pardoning Power of the Executive&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton.

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''THE President of the United States is to be &quot;commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several States WHEN CALLED INTO THE ACTUAL SERVICE of the United States.&quot; The propriety of this provision is so evident in itself, and it is, at the same time, so consonant to the precedents of the State constitutions in general, that little need be said to explain or enforce it. Even those of them which have, in other respects, coupled the chief magistrate with a council, have for the most part concentrated the military authority in him alone. Of all the cares or concerns of government, the direction of war most peculiarly demands those qualities which distinguish the exercise of power by a single hand. The direction of war implies the direction of the common strength; and the power of directing and employing the common strength, forms a usual and essential part in the definition of the executive authority.''

''&quot;The President may require the opinion, in writing, of the principal officer in each of the executive departments, upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective officers.&quot; This I consider as a mere redundancy in the plan, as the right for which it provides would result of itself from the office.''

''He is also to be authorized to grant &quot;reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, EXCEPT IN CASES OF IMPEACHMENT.&quot; Humanity and good policy conspire to dictate, that the benign prerogative of pardoning should be as little as possible fettered or embarrassed. The criminal code of every country partakes so much of necessary severity, that without an easy access to exceptions in favor of unfortunate guilt, justice would wear a countenance too sanguinary and cruel. As the sense of responsibility is always strongest, in proportion as it is undivided, it may be inferred that a single man would be most ready to attend to the force of those motives which might plead for a mitigation of the rigor of the law, and least apt to yield to considerations which were calculated to shelter a fit object of its vengeance. The reflection that the fate of a fellow-creature depended on his sole fiat, would naturally inspire scrupulousness and caution; the dread of being accused of weakness or connivance, would beget equal circumspection, though of a different kind. On the other hand, as men generally derive confidence from their numbers, they might often encourage each other in an act of obduracy, and might be less sensible to the apprehension of suspicion or censure for an injudicious or affected clemency. On these accounts, one man appears to be a more eligible dispenser of the mercy of government, than a body of men.''

''The expediency of vesting the power of pardoning in the President has, if I mistake not, been only contested in relation to the crime of treason. This, it has been urged, ought to have depended upon the assent of one, or both, of the branches of the legislative body. I shall not deny that there are strong reasons to be assigned for requiring in this particular the concurrence of that body, or of a part of it. As treason is a crime levelled at the immediate being of the society, when the laws have once ascertained the guilt of the offender, there seems a fitness in referring the expediency of an act of mercy towards him to the judgment of the legislature. And this ought the rather to be the case, as the supposition of the connivance of the Chief Magistrate ought not to be entirely excluded. But there are also strong objections to such a plan. It is not to be doubted, that a single man of prudence and good sense is better fitted, in delicate conjunctures, to balance the motives which may plead for and against the remission of the punishment, than any numerous body whatever. It deserves particular attention, that treason will often be connected with seditions which embrace a large proportion of the community; as lately happened in Massachusetts. In every such case, we might expect to see the representation of the people tainted with the same spirit which had given birth to the offense. And when parties were pretty equally matched, the secret sympathy of the friends and favorers of the condemned person, availing itself of the good-nature and weakness of others, might frequently bestow impunity where the terror of an example was necessary. On the other hand, when the sedition had proceeded from causes which had inflamed the resentments of the major party, they might often be found obstinate and inexorable, when policy demanded a conduct of forbearance and clemency. But the principal argument for reposing the power of pardoning in this case to the Chief Magistrate is this: in seasons of insurrection or rebellion, there are often critical moments, when a welltimed offer of pardon to the insurgents or rebels may restore the tranquillity of the commonwealth; and which, if suffered to pass unimproved, it may never be possible afterwards to recall. The dilatory process of convening the legislature, or one of its branches, for the purpose of obtaining its sanction to the measure, would frequently be the occasion of letting slip the golden opportunity. The loss of a week, a day, an hour, may sometimes be fatal. If it should be observed, that a discretionary power, with a view to such contingencies, might be occasionally conferred upon the President, it may be answered in the first place, that it is questionable, whether, in a limited Constitution, that power could be delegated by law; and in the second place, that it would generally be impolitic beforehand to take any step which might hold out the prospect of impunity. A proceeding of this kind, out of the usual course, would be likely to be construed into an argument of timidity or of weakness, and would have a tendency to embolden guilt.''

Though this provision has been assailed, on different grounds, with no small degree of vehemence, I scruple not to declare my firm persuasion, that it is one of the best digested and most unexceptionable parts of the plan. One ground of objection is the trite topic of the intermixture of powers; some contending that the President ought alone to possess the power of making treaties; others, that it ought to have been exclusively deposited in the Senate. Another source of objection is derived from the small number of persons by whom a treaty may be made. Of those who espouse this objection, a part are of opinion that the House of Representatives ought to have been associated in the business, while another part seem to think that nothing more was necessary than to have substituted two thirds of ALL the members of the Senate, to two thirds of the members PRESENT. As I flatter myself the observations made in a preceding number upon this part of the plan must have sufficed to place it, to a discerning eye, in a very favorable light, I shall here content myself with offering only some supplementary remarks, principally with a view to the objections which have been just stated.

With regard to the intermixture of powers, I shall rely upon the explanations already given in other places, of the true sense of the rule upon which that objection is founded; and shall take it for granted, as an inference from them, that the union of the Executive with the Senate, in the article of treaties, is no infringement of that rule. I venture to add, that the particular nature of the power of making treaties indicates a peculiar propriety in that union. Though several writers on the subject of government place that power in the class of executive authorities, yet this is evidently an arbitrary disposition; for if we attend carefully to its operation, it will be found to partake more of the legislative than of the executive character, though it does not seem strictly to fall within the definition of either of them. The essence of the legislative authority is to enact laws, or, in other words, to prescribe rules for the regulation of the society; while the execution of the laws, and the employment of the common strength, either for this purpose or for the common defense, seem to comprise all the functions of the executive magistrate. The power of making treaties is, plainly, neither the one nor the other. It relates neither to the execution of the subsisting laws, nor to the enaction of new ones; and still less to an exertion of the common strength. Its objects are CONTRACTS with foreign nations, which have the force of law, but derive it from the obligations of good faith. They are not rules prescribed by the sovereign to the subject, but agreements between sovereign and sovereign. The power in question seems therefore to form a distinct department, and to belong, properly, neither to the legislative nor to the executive. The qualities elsewhere detailed as indispensable in the management of foreign negotiations, point out the Executive as the most fit agent in those transactions; while the vast importance of the trust, and the operation of treaties as laws, plead strongly for the participation of the whole or a portion of the legislative body in the office of making them.

However proper or safe it may be in governments where the executive magistrate is an hereditary monarch, to commit to him the entire power of making treaties, it would be utterly unsafe and improper to entrust that power to an elective magistrate of four years' duration. It has been remarked, upon another occasion, and the remark is unquestionably just, that an hereditary monarch, though often the oppressor of his people, has personally too much stake in the government to be in any material danger of being corrupted by foreign powers. But a man raised from the station of a private citizen to the rank of chief magistrate, possessed of a moderate or slender fortune, and looking forward to a period not very remote when he may probably be obliged to return to the station from which he was taken, might sometimes be under temptations to sacrifice his duty to his interest, which it would require superlative virtue to withstand. An avaricious man might be tempted to betray the interests of the state to the acquisition of wealth. An ambitious man might make his own aggrandizement, by the aid of a foreign power, the price of his treachery to his constituents. The history of human conduct does not warrant that exalted opinion of human virtue which would make it wise in a nation to commit interests of so delicate and momentous a kind, as those which concern its intercourse with the rest of the world, to the sole disposal of a magistrate created and circumstanced as would be a President of the United States.

To have entrusted the power of making treaties to the Senate alone, would have been to relinquish the benefits of the constitutional agency of the President in the conduct of foreign negotiations. It is true that the Senate would, in that case, have the option of employing him in this capacity, but they would also have the option of letting it alone, and pique or cabal might induce the latter rather than the former. Besides this, the ministerial servant of the Senate could not be expected to enjoy the confidence and respect of foreign powers in the same degree with the constitutional representatives of the nation, and, of course, would not be able to act with an equal degree of weight or efficacy. While the Union would, from this cause, lose a considerable advantage in the management of its external concerns, the people would lose the additional security which would result from the co-operation of the Executive. Though it would be imprudent to confide in him solely so important a trust, yet it cannot be doubted that his participation would materially add to the safety of the society. It must indeed be clear to a demonstration that the joint possession of the power in question, by the President and Senate, would afford a greater prospect of security, than the separate possession of it by either of them. And whoever has maturely weighed the circumstances which must concur in the appointment of a President, will be satisfied that the office will always bid fair to be filled by men of such characters as to render their concurrence in the formation of treaties peculiarly desirable, as well on the score of wisdom, as on that of integrity.

The remarks made in a former number, which have been alluded to in another part of this paper, will apply with conclusive force against the admission of the House of Representatives to a share in the formation of treaties. The fluctuating and, taking its future increase into the account, the multitudinous composition of that body, forbid us to expect in it those qualities which are essential to the proper execution of such a trust. Accurate and comprehensive knowledge of foreign politics; a steady and systematic adherence to the same views; a nice and uniform sensibility to national character; decision, SECRECY, and despatch, are incompatible with the genius of a body so variable and so numerous. The very complication of the business, by introducing a necessity of the concurrence of so many different bodies, would of itself afford a solid objection. The greater frequency of the calls upon the House of Representatives, and the greater length of time which it would often be necessary to keep them together when convened, to obtain their sanction in the progressive stages of a treaty, would be a source of so great inconvenience and expense as alone ought to condemn the project.

The only objection which remains to be canvassed, is that which would substitute the proportion of two thirds of all the members composing the senatorial body, to that of two thirds of the members PRESENT. It has been shown, under the second head of our inquiries, that all provisions which require more than the majority of any body to its resolutions, have a direct tendency to embarrass the operations of the government, and an indirect one to subject the sense of the majority to that of the minority. This consideration seems sufficient to determine our opinion, that the convention have gone as far in the endeavor to secure the advantage of numbers in the formation of treaties as could have been reconciled either with the activity of the public councils or with a reasonable regard to the major sense of the community. If two thirds of the whole number of members had been required, it would, in many cases, from the non-attendance of a part, amount in practice to a necessity of unanimity. And the history of every political establishment in which this principle has prevailed, is a history of impotence, perplexity, and disorder. Proofs of this position might be adduced from the examples of the Roman Tribuneship, the Polish Diet, and the States-General of the Netherlands, did not an example at home render foreign precedents unnecessary.

To require a fixed proportion of the whole body would not, in all probability, contribute to the advantages of a numerous agency, better than merely to require a proportion of the attending members. The former, by making a determinate number at all times requisite to a resolution, diminishes the motives to punctual attendance. The latter, by making the capacity of the body to depend on a PROPORTION which may be varied by the absence or presence of a single member, has the contrary effect. And as, by promoting punctuality, it tends to keep the body complete, there is great likelihood that its resolutions would generally be dictated by as great a number in this case as in the other; while there would be much fewer occasions of delay. It ought not to be forgotten that, under the existing Confederation, two members MAY, and usually DO, represent a State; whence it happens that Congress, who now are solely invested with ALL THE POWERS of the Union, rarely consist of a greater number of persons than would compose the intended Senate. If we add to this, that as the members vote by States, and that where there is only a single member present from a State, his vote is lost, it will justify a supposition that the active voices in the Senate, where the members are to vote individually, would rarely fall short in number of the active voices in the existing Congress. When, in addition to these considerations, we take into view the co-operation of the President, we shall not hesitate to infer that the people of America would have greater security against an improper use of the power of making treaties, under the new Constitution, than they now enjoy under the Confederation. And when we proceed still one step further, and look forward to the probable augmentation of the Senate, by the erection of new States, we shall not only perceive ample ground of confidence in the sufficiency of the members to whose agency that power will be entrusted, but we shall probably be led to conclude that a body more numerous than the Senate would be likely to become, would be very little fit for the proper discharge of the trust.''

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''THE President is &quot;to NOMINATE, and, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the United States whose appointments are not otherwise provided for in the Constitution. But the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers as they think proper, in the President alone, or in the courts of law, or in the heads of departments. The President shall have power to fill up ALL VACANCIES which may happen DURING THE RECESS OF THE SENATE, by granting commissions which shall EXPIRE at the end of their next session.&quot;''

''It has been observed in a former paper, that &quot;the true test of a good government is its aptitude and tendency to produce a good administration.&quot; If the justness of this observation be admitted, the mode of appointing the officers of the United States contained in the foregoing clauses, must, when examined, be allowed to be entitled to particular commendation. It is not easy to conceive a plan better calculated than this to promote a judicious choice of men for filling the offices of the Union; and it will not need proof, that on this point must essentially depend the character of its administration.''

''It will be agreed on all hands, that the power of appointment, in ordinary cases, ought to be modified in one of three ways. It ought either to be vested in a single man, or in a SELECT assembly of a moderate number; or in a single man, with the concurrence of such an assembly. The exercise of it by the people at large will be readily admitted to be impracticable; as waiving every other consideration, it would leave them little time to do anything else. When, therefore, mention is made in the subsequent reasonings of an assembly or body of men, what is said must be understood to relate to a select body or assembly, of the description already given. The people collectively, from their number and from their dispersed situation, cannot be regulated in their movements by that systematic spirit of cabal and intrigue, which will be urged as the chief objections to reposing the power in question in a body of men.''

''Those who have themselves reflected upon the subject, or who have attended to the observations made in other parts of these papers, in relation to the appointment of the President, will, I presume, agree to the position, that there would always be great probability of having the place supplied by a man of abilities, at least respectable. Premising this, I proceed to lay it down as a rule, that one man of discernment is better fitted to analyze and estimate the peculiar qualities adapted to particular offices, than a body of men of equal or perhaps even of superior discernment.''

''The sole and undivided responsibility of one man will naturally beget a livelier sense of duty and a more exact regard to reputation. He will, on this account, feel himself under stronger obligations, and more interested to investigate with care the qualities requisite to the stations to be filled, and to prefer with impartiality the persons who may have the fairest pretensions to them. He will have FEWER personal attachments to gratify, than a body of men who may each be supposed to have an equal number; and will be so much the less liable to be misled by the sentiments of friendship and of affection. A single well-directed man, by a single understanding, cannot be distracted and warped by that diversity of views, feelings, and interests, which frequently distract and warp the resolutions of a collective body. There is nothing so apt to agitate the passions of mankind as personal considerations whether they relate to ourselves or to others, who are to be the objects of our choice or preference. Hence, in every exercise of the power of appointing to offices, by an assembly of men, we must expect to see a full display of all the private and party likings and dislikes, partialities and antipathies, attachments and animosities, which are felt by those who compose the assembly. The choice which may at any time happen to be made under such circumstances, will of course be the result either of a victory gained by one party over the other, or of a compromise between the parties. In either case, the intrinsic merit of the candidate will be too often out of sight. In the first, the qualifications best adapted to uniting the suffrages of the party, will be more considered than those which fit the person for the station. In the last, the coalition will commonly turn upon some interested equivalent: &quot;Give us the man we wish for this office, and you shall have the one you wish for that.&quot; This will be the usual condition of the bargain. And it will rarely happen that the advancement of the public service will be the primary object either of party victories or of party negotiations.''

''The truth of the principles here advanced seems to have been felt by the most intelligent of those who have found fault with the provision made, in this respect, by the convention. They contend that the President ought solely to have been authorized to make the appointments under the federal government. But it is easy to show, that every advantage to be expected from such an arrangement would, in substance, be derived from the power of NOMINATION, which is proposed to be conferred upon him; while several disadvantages which might attend the absolute power of appointment in the hands of that officer would be avoided. In the act of nomination, his judgment alone would be exercised; and as it would be his sole duty to point out the man who, with the approbation of the Senate, should fill an office, his responsibility would be as complete as if he were to make the final appointment. There can, in this view, be no difference between nominating and appointing. The same motives which would influence a proper discharge of his duty in one case, would exist in the other. And as no man could be appointed but on his previous nomination, every man who might be appointed would be, in fact, his choice.''

''But might not his nomination be overruled? I grant it might, yet this could only be to make place for another nomination by himself. The person ultimately appointed must be the object of his preference, though perhaps not in the first degree. It is also not very probable that his nomination would often be overruled. The Senate could not be tempted, by the preference they might feel to another, to reject the one proposed; because they could not assure themselves, that the person they might wish would be brought forward by a second or by any subsequent nomination. They could not even be certain, that a future nomination would present a candidate in any degree more acceptable to them; and as their dissent might cast a kind of stigma upon the individual rejected, and might have the appearance of a reflection upon the judgment of the chief magistrate, it is not likely that their sanction would often be refused, where there were not special and strong reasons for the refusal.''

''To what purpose then require the co-operation of the Senate? I answer, that the necessity of their concurrence would have a powerful, though, in general, a silent operation. It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the President, and would tend greatly to prevent the appointment of unfit characters from State prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment, or from a view to popularity. In addition to this, it would be an efficacious source of stability in the administration.''

''It will readily be comprehended, that a man who had himself the sole disposition of offices, would be governed much more by his private inclinations and interests, than when he was bound to submit the propriety of his choice to the discussion and determination of a different and independent body, and that body an entire branch of the legislature. The possibility of rejection would be a strong motive to care in proposing. The danger to his own reputation, and, in the case of an elective magistrate, to his political existence, from betraying a spirit of favoritism, or an unbecoming pursuit of popularity, to the observation of a body whose opinion would have great weight in forming that of the public, could not fail to operate as a barrier to the one and to the other. He would be both ashamed and afraid to bring forward, for the most distinguished or lucrative stations, candidates who had no other merit than that of coming from the same State to which he particularly belonged, or of being in some way or other personally allied to him, or of possessing the necessary insignificance and pliancy to render them the obsequious instruments of his pleasure.''

''To this reasoning it has been objected that the President, by the influence of the power of nomination, may secure the complaisance of the Senate to his views. This supposition of universal venality in human nature is little less an error in political reasoning, than the supposition of universal rectitude. The institution of delegated power implies, that there is a portion of virtue and honor among mankind, which may be a reasonable foundation of confidence; and experience justifies the theory. It has been found to exist in the most corrupt periods of the most corrupt governments. The venality of the British House of Commons has been long a topic of accusation against that body, in the country to which they belong as well as in this; and it cannot be doubted that the charge is, to a considerable extent, well founded. But it is as little to be doubted, that there is always a large proportion of the body, which consists of independent and public-spirited men, who have an influential weight in the councils of the nation. Hence it is (the present reign not excepted) that the sense of that body is often seen to control the inclinations of the monarch, both with regard to men and to measures. Though it might therefore be allowable to suppose that the Executive might occasionally influence some individuals in the Senate, yet the supposition, that he could in general purchase the integrity of the whole body, would be forced and improbable. A man disposed to view human nature as it is, without either flattering its virtues or exaggerating its vices, will see sufficient ground of confidence in the probity of the Senate, to rest satisfied, not only that it will be impracticable to the Executive to corrupt or seduce a majority of its members, but that the necessity of its co-operation, in the business of appointments, will be a considerable and salutary restraint upon the conduct of that magistrate. Nor is the integrity of the Senate the only reliance. The Constitution has provided some important guards against the danger of executive influence upon the legislative body: it declares that &quot;No senator or representative shall during the time FOR WHICH HE WAS ELECTED, be appointed to any civil office under the United States, which shall have been created, or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased, during such time; and no person, holding any office under the United States, shall be a member of either house during his continuance in office.&quot;''

''To the People of the State of New York:''

''IT HAS been mentioned as one of the advantages to be expected from the co-operation of the Senate, in the business of appointments, that it would contribute to the stability of the administration. The consent of that body would be necessary to displace as well as to appoint. A change of the Chief Magistrate, therefore, would not occasion so violent or so general a revolution in the officers of the government as might be expected, if he were the sole disposer of offices. Where a man in any station had given satisfactory evidence of his fitness for it, a new President would be restrained from attempting a change in favor of a person more agreeable to him, by the apprehension that a discountenance of the Senate might frustrate the attempt, and bring some degree of discredit upon himself. Those who can best estimate the value of a steady administration, will be most disposed to prize a provision which connects the official existence of public men with the approbation or disapprobation of that body which, from the greater permanency of its own composition, will in all probability be less subject to inconstancy than any other member of the government.''

''To this union of the Senate with the President, in the article of appointments, it has in some cases been suggested that it would serve to give the President an undue influence over the Senate, and in others that it would have an opposite tendency, a strong proof that neither suggestion is true.''

''To state the first in its proper form, is to refute it. It amounts to this: the President would have an improper INFLUENCE OVER the Senate, because the Senate would have the power of RESTRAINING him. This is an absurdity in terms. It cannot admit of a doubt that the entire power of appointment would enable him much more effectually to establish a dangerous empire over that body, than a mere power of nomination subject to their control.''

''Let us take a view of the converse of the proposition: &quot;the Senate would influence the Executive.&quot; As I have had occasion to remark in several other instances, the indistinctness of the objection forbids a precise answer. In what manner is this influence to be exerted? In relation to what objects? The power of influencing a person, in the sense in which it is here used, must imply a power of conferring a benefit upon him. How could the Senate confer a benefit upon the President by the manner of employing their right of negative upon his nominations? If it be said they might sometimes gratify him by an acquiescence in a favorite choice, when public motives might dictate a different conduct, I answer, that the instances in which the President could be personally interested in the result, would be too few to admit of his being materially affected by the compliances of the Senate. The POWER which can ORIGINATE the disposition of honors and emoluments, is more likely to attract than to be attracted by the POWER which can merely obstruct their course. If by influencing the President be meant RESTRAINING him, this is precisely what must have been intended. And it has been shown that the restraint would be salutary, at the same time that it would not be such as to destroy a single advantage to be looked for from the uncontrolled agency of that Magistrate. The right of nomination would produce all the good of that of appointment, and would in a great measure avoid its evils. Upon a comparison of the plan for the appointment of the officers of the proposed government with that which is established by the constitution of this State, a decided preference must be given to the former. In that plan the power of nomination is unequivocally vested in the Executive. And as there would be a necessity for submitting each nomination to the judgment of an entire branch of the legislature, the circumstances attending an appointment, from the mode of conducting it, would naturally become matters of notoriety; and the public would be at no loss to determine what part had been performed by the different actors. The blame of a bad nomination would fall upon the President singly and absolutely. The censure of rejecting a good one would lie entirely at the door of the Senate; aggravated by the consideration of their having counteracted the good intentions of the Executive. If an ill appointment should be made, the Executive for nominating, and the Senate for approving, would participate, though in different degrees, in the opprobrium and disgrace.''

''The reverse of all this characterizes the manner of appointment in this State. The council of appointment consists of from three to five persons, of whom the governor is always one. This small body, shut up in a private apartment, impenetrable to the public eye, proceed to the execution of the trust committed to them. It is known that the governor claims the right of nomination, upon the strength of some ambiguous expressions in the constitution; but it is not known to what extent, or in what manner he exercises it; nor upon what occasions he is contradicted or opposed. The censure of a bad appointment, on account of the uncertainty of its author, and for want of a determinate object, has neither poignancy nor duration. And while an unbounded field for cabal and intrigue lies open, all idea of responsibility is lost. The most that the public can know, is that the governor claims the right of nomination; that TWO out of the inconsiderable number of FOUR men can too often be managed without much difficulty; that if some of the members of a particular council should happen to be of an uncomplying character, it is frequently not impossible to get rid of their opposition by regulating the times of meeting in such a manner as to render their attendance inconvenient; and that from whatever cause it may proceed, a great number of very improper appointments are from time to time made. Whether a governor of this State avails himself of the ascendant he must necessarily have, in this delicate and important part of the administration, to prefer to offices men who are best qualified for them, or whether he prostitutes that advantage to the advancement of persons whose chief merit is their implicit devotion to his will, and to the support of a despicable and dangerous system of personal influence, are questions which, unfortunately for the community, can only be the subjects of speculation and conjecture.''

''Every mere council of appointment, however constituted, will be a conclave, in which cabal and intrigue will have their full scope. Their number, without an unwarrantable increase of expense, cannot be large enough to preclude a facility of combination. And as each member will have his friends and connections to provide for, the desire of mutual gratification will beget a scandalous bartering of votes and bargaining for places. The private attachments of one man might easily be satisfied; but to satisfy the private attachments of a dozen, or of twenty men, would occasion a monopoly of all the principal employments of the government in a few families, and would lead more directly to an aristocracy or an oligarchy than any measure that could be contrived. If, to avoid an accumulation of offices, there was to be a frequent change in the persons who were to compose the council, this would involve the mischiefs of a mutable administration in their full extent. Such a council would also be more liable to executive influence than the Senate, because they would be fewer in number, and would act less immediately under the public inspection. Such a council, in fine, as a substitute for the plan of the convention, would be productive of an increase of expense, a multiplication of the evils which spring from favoritism and intrigue in the distribution of public honors, a decrease of stability in the administration of the government, and a diminution of the security against an undue influence of the Executive. And yet such a council has been warmly contended for as an essential amendment in the proposed Constitution.''

''I could not with propriety conclude my observations on the subject of appointments without taking notice of a scheme for which there have appeared some, though but few advocates; I mean that of uniting the House of Representatives in the power of making them. I shall, however, do little more than mention it, as I cannot imagine that it is likely to gain the countenance of any considerable part of the community. A body so fluctuating and at the same time so numerous, can never be deemed proper for the exercise of that power. Its unfitness will appear manifest to all, when it is recollected that in half a century it may consist of three or four hundred persons. All the advantages of the stability, both of the Executive and of the Senate, would be defeated by this union, and infinite delays and embarrassments would be occasioned. The example of most of the States in their local constitutions encourages us to reprobate the idea.''

''The only remaining powers of the Executive are comprehended in giving information to Congress of the state of the Union; in recommending to their consideration such measures as he shall judge expedient; in convening them, or either branch, upon extraordinary occasions; in adjourning them when they cannot themselves agree upon the time of adjournment; in receiving ambassadors and other public ministers; in faithfully executing the laws; and in commissioning all the officers of the United States.''

''Except some cavils about the power of convening EITHER house of the legislature, and that of receiving ambassadors, no objection has been made to this class of authorities; nor could they possibly admit of any. It required, indeed, an insatiable avidity for censure to invent exceptions to the parts which have been excepted to. In regard to the power of convening either house of the legislature, I shall barely remark, that in respect to the Senate at least, we can readily discover a good reason for it. AS this body has a concurrent power with the Executive in the article of treaties, it might often be necessary to call it together with a view to this object, when it would be unnecessary and improper to convene the House of Representatives. As to the reception of ambassadors, what I have said in a former paper will furnish a sufficient answer.''

''We have now completed a survey of the structure and powers of the executive department, which, I have endeavored to show, combines, as far as republican principles will admit, all the requisites to energy. The remaining inquiry is: Does it also combine the requisites to safety, in a republican sense, a due dependence on the people, a due responsibility? The answer to this question has been anticipated in the investigation of its other characteristics, and is satisfactorily deducible from these circumstances; from the election of the President once in four years by persons immediately chosen by the people for that purpose; and from his being at all times liable to impeachment, trial, dismission from office, incapacity to serve in any other, and to forfeiture of life and estate by subsequent prosecution in the common course of law. But these precautions, great as they are, are not the only ones which the plan of the convention has provided in favor of the public security. In the only instances in which the abuse of the executive authority was materially to be feared, the Chief Magistrate of the United States would, by that plan, be subjected to the control of a branch of the legislative body. What more could be desired by an enlightened and reasonable people?''

==Federalist No. 78==
Federalist No. 78 is titled ''&quot;The Judiciary Department&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton.

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:

''WE PROCEED now to an examination of the judiciary department of the proposed government.''

''In unfolding the defects of the existing Confederation, the utility and necessity of a federal judicature have been clearly pointed out. It is the less necessary to recapitulate the considerations there urged, as the propriety of the institution in the abstract is not disputed; the only questions which have been raised being relative to the manner of constituting it, and to its extent. To these points, therefore, our observations shall be confined.''

''The manner of constituting it seems to embrace these several objects: 1st. The mode of appointing the judges. 2d. The tenure by which they are to hold their places. 3d. The partition of the judiciary authority between different courts, and their relations to each other.''

''First. As to the mode of appointing the judges; this is the same with that of appointing the officers of the Union in general, and has been so fully discussed in the two last numbers, that nothing can be said here which would not be useless repetition.''

''Second. As to the tenure by which the judges are to hold their places; this chiefly concerns their duration in office; the provisions for their support; the precautions for their responsibility.''

''According to the plan of the convention, all judges who may be appointed by the United States are to hold their offices DURING GOOD BEHAVIOR; which is conformable to the most approved of the State constitutions and among the rest, to that of this State. Its propriety having been drawn into question by the adversaries of that plan, is no light symptom of the rage for objection, which disorders their imaginations and judgments. The standard of good behavior for the continuance in office of the judicial magistracy, is certainly one of the most valuable of the modern improvements in the practice of government. In a monarchy it is an excellent barrier to the despotism of the prince; in a republic it is a no less excellent barrier to the encroachments and oppressions of the representative body. And it is the best expedient which can be devised in any government, to secure a steady, upright, and impartial administration of the laws.''

''Whoever attentively considers the different departments of power must perceive, that, in a government in which they are separated from each other, the judiciary, from the nature of its functions, will always be the least dangerous to the political rights of the Constitution; because it will be least in a capacity to annoy or injure them. The Executive not only dispenses the honors, but holds the sword of the community. The legislature not only commands the purse, but prescribes the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated. The judiciary, on the contrary, has no influence over either the sword or the purse; no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society; and can take no active resolution whatever. It may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.''

''This simple view of the matter suggests several important consequences. It proves incontestably, that the judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the three departments of power; that it can never attack with success either of the other two; and that all possible care is requisite to enable it to defend itself against their attacks. It equally proves, that though individual oppression may now and then proceed from the courts of justice, the general liberty of the people can never be endangered from that quarter; I mean so long as the judiciary remains truly distinct from both the legislature and the Executive. For I agree, that &quot;there is no liberty, if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers.&quot; And it proves, in the last place, that as liberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary alone, but would have every thing to fear from its union with either of the other departments; that as all the effects of such a union must ensue from a dependence of the former on the latter, notwithstanding a nominal and apparent separation; that as, from the natural feebleness of the judiciary, it is in continual jeopardy of being overpowered, awed, or influenced by its co-ordinate branches; and that as nothing can contribute so much to its firmness and independence as permanency in office, this quality may therefore be justly regarded as an indispensable ingredient in its constitution, and, in a great measure, as the citadel of the public justice and the public security.''

''The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited Constitution. By a limited Constitution, I understand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority; such, for instance, as that it shall pass no bills of attainder, no ex-post-facto laws, and the like. Limitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of courts of justice, whose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the Constitution void. Without this, all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing.''

''Some perplexity respecting the rights of the courts to pronounce legislative acts void, because contrary to the Constitution, has arisen from an imagination that the doctrine would imply a superiority of the judiciary to the legislative power. It is urged that the authority which can declare the acts of another void, must necessarily be superior to the one whose acts may be declared void. As this doctrine is of great importance in all the American constitutions, a brief discussion of the ground on which it rests cannot be unacceptable.''

''There is no position which depends on clearer principles, than that every act of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of the commission under which it is exercised, is void. No legislative act, therefore, contrary to the Constitution, can be valid. To deny this, would be to affirm, that the deputy is greater than his principal; that the servant is above his master; that the representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves; that men acting by virtue of powers, may do not only what their powers do not authorize, but what they forbid.''

''If it be said that the legislative body are themselves the constitutional judges of their own powers, and that the construction they put upon them is conclusive upon the other departments, it may be answered, that this cannot be the natural presumption, where it is not to be collected from any particular provisions in the Constitution. It is not otherwise to be supposed, that the Constitution could intend to enable the representatives of the people to substitute their WILL to that of their constituents. It is far more rational to suppose, that the courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature, in order, among other things, to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority. The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body. If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two, that which has the superior obligation and validity ought, of course, to be preferred; or, in other words, the Constitution ought to be preferred to the statute, the intention of the people to the intention of their agents.''

''Nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of the judicial to the legislative power. It only supposes that the power of the people is superior to both; and that where the will of the legislature, declared in its statutes, stands in opposition to that of the people, declared in the Constitution, the judges ought to be governed by the latter rather than the former. They ought to regulate their decisions by the fundamental laws, rather than by those which are not fundamental.''

''This exercise of judicial discretion, in determining between two contradictory laws, is exemplified in a familiar instance. It not uncommonly happens, that there are two statutes existing at one time, clashing in whole or in part with each other, and neither of them containing any repealing clause or expression. In such a case, it is the province of the courts to liquidate and fix their meaning and operation. So far as they can, by any fair construction, be reconciled to each other, reason and law conspire to dictate that this should be done; where this is impracticable, it becomes a matter of necessity to give effect to one, in exclusion of the other. The rule which has obtained in the courts for determining their relative validity is, that the last in order of time shall be preferred to the first. But this is a mere rule of construction, not derived from any positive law, but from the nature and reason of the thing. It is a rule not enjoined upon the courts by legislative provision, but adopted by themselves, as consonant to truth and propriety, for the direction of their conduct as interpreters of the law. They thought it reasonable, that between the interfering acts of an EQUAL authority, that which was the last indication of its will should have the preference.''

''But in regard to the interfering acts of a superior and subordinate authority, of an original and derivative power, the nature and reason of the thing indicate the converse of that rule as proper to be followed. They teach us that the prior act of a superior ought to be preferred to the subsequent act of an inferior and subordinate authority; and that accordingly, whenever a particular statute contravenes the Constitution, it will be the duty of the judicial tribunals to adhere to the latter and disregard the former.''

''It can be of no weight to say that the courts, on the pretense of a repugnancy, may substitute their own pleasure to the constitutional intentions of the legislature. This might as well happen in the case of two contradictory statutes; or it might as well happen in every adjudication upon any single statute. The courts must declare the sense of the law; and if they should be disposed to exercise WILL instead of JUDGMENT, the consequence would equally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative body. The observation, if it prove any thing, would prove that there ought to be no judges distinct from that body.''

''If, then, the courts of justice are to be considered as the bulwarks of a limited Constitution against legislative encroachments, this consideration will afford a strong argument for the permanent tenure of judicial offices, since nothing will contribute so much as this to that independent spirit in the judges which must be essential to the faithful performance of so arduous a duty.''

''This independence of the judges is equally requisite to guard the Constitution and the rights of individuals from the effects of those ill humors, which the arts of designing men, or the influence of particular conjunctures, sometimes disseminate among the people themselves, and which, though they speedily give place to better information, and more deliberate reflection, have a tendency, in the meantime, to occasion dangerous innovations in the government, and serious oppressions of the minor party in the community. Though I trust the friends of the proposed Constitution will never concur with its enemies, in questioning that fundamental principle of republican government, which admits the right of the people to alter or abolish the established Constitution, whenever they find it inconsistent with their happiness, yet it is not to be inferred from this principle, that the representatives of the people, whenever a momentary inclination happens to lay hold of a majority of their constituents, incompatible with the provisions in the existing Constitution, would, on that account, be justifiable in a violation of those provisions; or that the courts would be under a greater obligation to connive at infractions in this shape, than when they had proceeded wholly from the cabals of the representative body. Until the people have, by some solemn and authoritative act, annulled or changed the established form, it is binding upon themselves collectively, as well as individually; and no presumption, or even knowledge, of their sentiments, can warrant their representatives in a departure from it, prior to such an act. But it is easy to see, that it would require an uncommon portion of fortitude in the judges to do their duty as faithful guardians of the Constitution, where legislative invasions of it had been instigated by the major voice of the community.''

''But it is not with a view to infractions of the Constitution only, that the independence of the judges may be an essential safeguard against the effects of occasional ill humors in the society. These sometimes extend no farther than to the injury of the private rights of particular classes of citizens, by unjust and partial laws. Here also the firmness of the judicial magistracy is of vast importance in mitigating the severity and confining the operation of such laws. It not only serves to moderate the immediate mischiefs of those which may have been passed, but it operates as a check upon the legislative body in passing them; who, perceiving that obstacles to the success of iniquitous intention are to be expected from the scruples of the courts, are in a manner compelled, by the very motives of the injustice they meditate, to qualify their attempts. This is a circumstance calculated to have more influence upon the character of our governments, than but few may be aware of. The benefits of the integrity and moderation of the judiciary have already been felt in more States than one; and though they may have displeased those whose sinister expectations they may have disappointed, they must have commanded the esteem and applause of all the virtuous and disinterested. Considerate men, of every description, ought to prize whatever will tend to beget or fortify that temper in the courts: as no man can be sure that he may not be to-morrow the victim of a spirit of injustice, by which he may be a gainer to-day. And every man must now feel, that the inevitable tendency of such a spirit is to sap the foundations of public and private confidence, and to introduce in its stead universal distrust and distress.''

''That inflexible and uniform adherence to the rights of the Constitution, and of individuals, which we perceive to be indispensable in the courts of justice, can certainly not be expected from judges who hold their offices by a temporary commission. Periodical appointments, however regulated, or by whomsoever made, would, in some way or other, be fatal to their necessary independence. If the power of making them was committed either to the Executive or legislature, there would be danger of an improper complaisance to the branch which possessed it; if to both, there would be an unwillingness to hazard the displeasure of either; if to the people, or to persons chosen by them for the special purpose, there would be too great a disposition to consult popularity, to justify a reliance that nothing would be consulted but the Constitution and the laws.''

''There is yet a further and a weightier reason for the permanency of the judicial offices, which is deducible from the nature of the qualifications they require. It has been frequently remarked, with great propriety, that a voluminous code of laws is one of the inconveniences necessarily connected with the advantages of a free government. To avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is indispensable that they should be bound down by strict rules and precedents, which serve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that comes before them; and it will readily be conceived from the variety of controversies which grow out of the folly and wickedness of mankind, that the records of those precedents must unavoidably swell to a very considerable bulk, and must demand long and laborious study to acquire a competent knowledge of them. Hence it is, that there can be but few men in the society who will have sufficient skill in the laws to qualify them for the stations of judges. And making the proper deductions for the ordinary depravity of human nature, the number must be still smaller of those who unite the requisite integrity with the requisite knowledge. These considerations apprise us, that the government can have no great option between fit character; and that a temporary duration in office, which would naturally discourage such characters from quitting a lucrative line of practice to accept a seat on the bench, would have a tendency to throw the administration of justice into hands less able, and less well qualified, to conduct it with utility and dignity. In the present circumstances of this country, and in those in which it is likely to be for a long time to come, the disadvantages on this score would be greater than they may at first sight appear; but it must be confessed, that they are far inferior to those which present themselves under the other aspects of the subject.''

''Upon the whole, there can be no room to doubt that the convention acted wisely in copying from the models of those constitutions which have established GOOD BEHAVIOR as the tenure of their judicial offices, in point of duration; and that so far from being blamable on this account, their plan would have been inexcusably defective, if it had wanted this important feature of good government. The experience of Great Britain affords an illustrious comment on the excellence of the institution.''

===Analysis===
This Federalist Paper was written to explicate and justify the structure of the judiciary under the proposed Constitution; it is the first of six essays by Hamilton on this issue. In particular, it addresses concerns by the Anti-Federalists over the scope and power of the federal judiciary, which would have comprised unelected, politically insulated judges that would be appointed for life.

Hamilton says that the Judiciary branch of the proposed government would be the weakest of the three. Hamilton believed that because the judiciary had neither &quot;FORCE nor WILL&quot; to enforce its judgments, there was little concern that the judiciary would be able to overpower the political branches. The political branches have the institutional capacity to make and enforce the law: Congress controls the money flow and the President controls the military. Courts, on the other hand, do not have the same clout from a constitutional design standpoint. The judiciary depends on the political branches to uphold its judgments. Legal academics often argue over Hamilton's description of the judiciary as the &quot;least dangerous&quot; branch. Hamilton also explains how federal judges should retain life terms as long as those judges exhibit good behavior.

''To the People of the State of New York:''

''NEXT to permanency in office, nothing can contribute more to the independence of the judges than a fixed provision for their support. The remark made in relation to the President is equally applicable here. In the general course of human nature, A POWER OVER A MAN's SUBSISTENCE AMOUNTS TO A POWER OVER HIS WILL. And we can never hope to see realized in practice, the complete separation of the judicial from the legislative power, in any system which leaves the former dependent for pecuniary resources on the occasional grants of the latter. The enlightened friends to good government in every State, have seen cause to lament the want of precise and explicit precautions in the State constitutions on this head. Some of these indeed have declared that PERMANENT salaries should be established for the judges; but the experiment has in some instances shown that such expressions are not sufficiently definite to preclude legislative evasions. Something still more positive and unequivocal has been evinced to be requisite. The plan of the convention accordingly has provided that the judges of the United States &quot;shall at STATED TIMES receive for their services a compensation which shall not be DIMINISHED during their continuance in office.&quot;''

''This, all circumstances considered, is the most eligible provision that could have been devised. It will readily be understood that the fluctuations in the value of money and in the state of society rendered a fixed rate of compensation in the Constitution inadmissible. What might be extravagant to-day, might in half a century become penurious and inadequate. It was therefore necessary to leave it to the discretion of the legislature to vary its provisions in conformity to the variations in circumstances, yet under such restrictions as to put it out of the power of that body to change the condition of the individual for the worse. A man may then be sure of the ground upon which he stands, and can never be deterred from his duty by the apprehension of being placed in a less eligible situation. The clause which has been quoted combines both advantages. The salaries of judicial officers may from time to time be altered, as occasion shall require, yet so as never to lessen the allowance with which any particular judge comes into office, in respect to him. It will be observed that a difference has been made by the convention between the compensation of the President and of the judges, That of the former can neither be increased nor diminished; that of the latter can only not be diminished. This probably arose from the difference in the duration of the respective offices. As the President is to be elected for no more than four years, it can rarely happen that an adequate salary, fixed at the commencement of that period, will not continue to be such to its end. But with regard to the judges, who, if they behave properly, will be secured in their places for life, it may well happen, especially in the early stages of the government, that a stipend, which would be very sufficient at their first appointment, would become too small in the progress of their service.''

''This provision for the support of the judges bears every mark of prudence and efficacy; and it may be safely affirmed that, together with the permanent tenure of their offices, it affords a better prospect of their independence than is discoverable in the constitutions of any of the States in regard to their own judges.''

''The precautions for their responsibility are comprised in the article respecting impeachments. They are liable to be impeached for malconduct by the House of Representatives, and tried by the Senate; and, if convicted, may be dismissed from office, and disqualified for holding any other. This is the only provision on the point which is consistent with the necessary independence of the judicial character, and is the only one which we find in our own Constitution in respect to our own judges.''

''The want of a provision for removing the judges on account of inability has been a subject of complaint. But all considerate men will be sensible that such a provision would either not be practiced upon or would be more liable to abuse than calculated to answer any good purpose. The mensuration of the faculties of the mind has, I believe, no place in the catalogue of known arts. An attempt to fix the boundary between the regions of ability and inability, would much oftener give scope to personal and party attachments and enmities than advance the interests of justice or the public good. The result, except in the case of insanity, must for the most part be arbitrary; and insanity, without any formal or express provision, may be safely pronounced to be a virtual disqualification.''

''The constitution of New York, to avoid investigations that must forever be vague and dangerous, has taken a particular age as the criterion of inability. No man can be a judge beyond sixty. I believe there are few at present who do not disapprove of this provision. There is no station, in relation to which it is less proper than to that of a judge. The deliberating and comparing faculties generally preserve their strength much beyond that period in men who survive it; and when, in addition to this circumstance, we consider how few there are who outlive the season of intellectual vigor, and how improbable it is that any considerable portion of the bench, whether more or less numerous, should be in such a situation at the same time, we shall be ready to conclude that limitations of this sort have little to recommend them. In a republic, where fortunes are not affluent, and pensions not expedient, the dismission of men from stations in which they have served their country long and usefully, on which they depend for subsistence, and from which it will be too late to resort to any other occupation for a livelihood, ought to have some better apology to humanity than is to be found in the imaginary danger of a superannuated bench.''

===Analysis===
This Federalist Paper is the second in a series of six essays discussing the powers and limitations of the judicial branch. In Federalist No. 78, Hamilton argued that &quot;permanence in office,&quot; as enshrined in lifelong appointments, was the most important guarantee of the independence of the judiciary. In this paper he states that the other main guarantee of that independence is the provision in the proposed Constitution of the United States for the financial independence of judges. Hamilton also argues that the ability of Congress to impeach judges provides protection against their misconduct despite their relative independence.

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''To JUDGE with accuracy of the proper extent of the federal judicature, it will be necessary to consider, in the first place, what are its proper objects.''

''It seems scarcely to admit of controversy, that the judiciary authority of the Union ought to extend to these several descriptions of cases: 1st, to all those which arise out of the laws of the United States, passed in pursuance of their just and constitutional powers of legislation; 2d, to all those which concern the execution of the provisions expressly contained in the articles of Union; 3d, to all those in which the United States are a party; 4th, to all those which involve the PEACE of the CONFEDERACY, whether they relate to the intercourse between the United States and foreign nations, or to that between the States themselves; 5th, to all those which originate on the high seas, and are of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction; and, lastly, to all those in which the State tribunals cannot be supposed to be impartial and unbiased.''

''The first point depends upon this obvious consideration, that there ought always to be a constitutional method of giving efficacy to constitutional provisions. What, for instance, would avail restrictions on the authority of the State legislatures, without some constitutional mode of enforcing the observance of them? The States, by the plan of the convention, are prohibited from doing a variety of things, some of which are incompatible with the interests of the Union, and others with the principles of good government. The imposition of duties on imported articles, and the emission of paper money, are specimens of each kind. No man of sense will believe, that such prohibitions would be scrupulously regarded, without some effectual power in the government to restrain or correct the infractions of them. This power must either be a direct negative on the State laws, or an authority in the federal courts to overrule such as might be in manifest contravention of the articles of Union. There is no third course that I can imagine. The latter appears to have been thought by the convention preferable to the former, and, I presume, will be most agreeable to the States.''

''As to the second point, it is impossible, by any argument or comment, to make it clearer than it is in itself. If there are such things as political axioms, the propriety of the judicial power of a government being coextensive with its legislative, may be ranked among the number. The mere necessity of uniformity in the interpretation of the national laws, decides the question. Thirteen independent courts of final jurisdiction over the same causes, arising upon the same laws, is a hydra in government, from which nothing but contradiction and confusion can proceed.''

''Still less need be said in regard to the third point. Controversies between the nation and its members or citizens, can only be properly referred to the national tribunals. Any other plan would be contrary to reason, to precedent, and to decorum.''

''The fourth point rests on this plain proposition, that the peace of the WHOLE ought not to be left at the disposal of a PART. The Union will undoubtedly be answerable to foreign powers for the conduct of its members. And the responsibility for an injury ought ever to be accompanied with the faculty of preventing it. As the denial or perversion of justice by the sentences of courts, as well as in any other manner, is with reason classed among the just causes of war, it will follow that the federal judiciary ought to have cognizance of all causes in which the citizens of other countries are concerned. This is not less essential to the preservation of the public faith, than to the security of the public tranquillity. A distinction may perhaps be imagined between cases arising upon treaties and the laws of nations and those which may stand merely on the footing of the municipal law. The former kind may be supposed proper for the federal jurisdiction, the latter for that of the States. But it is at least problematical, whether an unjust sentence against a foreigner, where the subject of controversy was wholly relative to the lex loci, would not, if unredressed, be an aggression upon his sovereign, as well as one which violated the stipulations of a treaty or the general law of nations. And a still greater objection to the distinction would result from the immense difficulty, if not impossibility, of a practical discrimination between the cases of one complexion and those of the other. So great a proportion of the cases in which foreigners are parties, involve national questions, that it is by far most safe and most expedient to refer all those in which they are concerned to the national tribunals.''

''The power of determining causes between two States, between one State and the citizens of another, and between the citizens of different States, is perhaps not less essential to the peace of the Union than that which has been just examined. History gives us a horrid picture of the dissensions and private wars which distracted and desolated Germany prior to the institution of the Imperial Chamber by Maximilian, towards the close of the fifteenth century; and informs us, at the same time, of the vast influence of that institution in appeasing the disorders and establishing the tranquillity of the empire. This was a court invested with authority to decide finally all differences among the members of the Germanic body.''

''A method of terminating territorial disputes between the States, under the authority of the federal head, was not unattended to, even in the imperfect system by which they have been hitherto held together. But there are many other sources, besides interfering claims of boundary, from which bickerings and animosities may spring up among the members of the Union. To some of these we have been witnesses in the course of our past experience. It will readily be conjectured that I allude to the fraudulent laws which have been passed in too many of the States. And though the proposed Constitution establishes particular guards against the repetition of those instances which have heretofore made their appearance, yet it is warrantable to apprehend that the spirit which produced them will assume new shapes, that could not be foreseen nor specifically provided against. Whatever practices may have a tendency to disturb the harmony between the States, are proper objects of federal superintendence and control.''

''It may be esteemed the basis of the Union, that &quot;the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens of the several States.&quot; And if it be a just principle that every government OUGHT TO POSSESS THE MEANS OF EXECUTING ITS OWN PROVISIONS BY ITS OWN AUTHORITY, it will follow, that in order to the inviolable maintenance of that equality of privileges and immunities to which the citizens of the Union will be entitled, the national judiciary ought to preside in all cases in which one State or its citizens are opposed to another State or its citizens. To secure the full effect of so fundamental a provision against all evasion and subterfuge, it is necessary that its construction should be committed to that tribunal which, having no local attachments, will be likely to be impartial between the different States and their citizens, and which, owing its official existence to the Union, will never be likely to feel any bias inauspicious to the principles on which it is founded.''

''The fifth point will demand little animadversion. The most bigoted idolizers of State authority have not thus far shown a disposition to deny the national judiciary the cognizances of maritime causes. These so generally depend on the laws of nations, and so commonly affect the rights of foreigners, that they fall within the considerations which are relative to the public peace. The most important part of them are, by the present Confederation, submitted to federal jurisdiction.''

''The reasonableness of the agency of the national courts in cases in which the State tribunals cannot be supposed to be impartial, speaks for itself. No man ought certainly to be a judge in his own cause, or in any cause in respect to which he has the least interest or bias. This principle has no inconsiderable weight in designating the federal courts as the proper tribunals for the determination of controversies between different States and their citizens. And it ought to have the same operation in regard to some cases between citizens of the same State. Claims to land under grants of different States, founded upon adverse pretensions of boundary, are of this description. The courts of neither of the granting States could be expected to be unbiased. The laws may have even prejudged the question, and tied the courts down to decisions in favor of the grants of the State to which they belonged. And even where this had not been done, it would be natural that the judges, as men, should feel a strong predilection to the claims of their own government.''

''Having thus laid down and discussed the principles which ought to regulate the constitution of the federal judiciary, we will proceed to test, by these principles, the particular powers of which, according to the plan of the convention, it is to be composed. It is to comprehend &quot;all cases in law and equity arising under the Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority; to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to controversies to which the United States shall be a party; to controversies between two or more States; between a State and citizens of another State; between citizens of different States; between citizens of the same State claiming lands and grants of different States; and between a State or the citizens thereof and foreign states, citizens, and subjects.&quot; This constitutes the entire mass of the judicial authority of the Union. Let us now review it in detail. It is, then, to extend:''

''First. To all cases in law and equity, ARISING UNDER THE CONSTITUTION and THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. This corresponds with the two first classes of causes, which have been enumerated, as proper for the jurisdiction of the United States. It has been asked, what is meant by &quot;cases arising under the Constitution,&quot; in contradiction from those &quot;arising under the laws of the United States&quot;? The difference has been already explained. All the restrictions upon the authority of the State legislatures furnish examples of it. They are not, for instance, to emit paper money; but the interdiction results from the Constitution, and will have no connection with any law of the United States. Should paper money, notwithstanding, be emited, the controversies concerning it would be cases arising under the Constitution and not the laws of the United States, in the ordinary signification of the terms. This may serve as a sample of the whole.''

''It has also been asked, what need of the word &quot;equity What equitable causes can grow out of the Constitution and laws of the United States? There is hardly a subject of litigation between individuals, which may not involve those ingredients of FRAUD, ACCIDENT, TRUST, or HARDSHIP, which would render the matter an object of equitable rather than of legal jurisdiction, as the distinction is known and established in several of the States. It is the peculiar province, for instance, of a court of equity to relieve against what are called hard bargains: these are contracts in which, though there may have been no direct fraud or deceit, sufficient to invalidate them in a court of law, yet there may have been some undue and unconscionable advantage taken of the necessities or misfortunes of one of the parties, which a court of equity would not tolerate. In such cases, where foreigners were concerned on either side, it would be impossible for the federal judicatories to do justice without an equitable as well as a legal jurisdiction. Agreements to convey lands claimed under the grants of different States, may afford another example of the necessity of an equitable jurisdiction in the federal courts. This reasoning may not be so palpable in those States where the formal and technical distinction between LAW and EQUITY is not maintained, as in this State, where it is exemplified by every day's practice.''

''The judiciary authority of the Union is to extend:''

''Second. To treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, and to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls. These belong to the fourth class of the enumerated cases, as they have an evident connection with the preservation of the national peace.''

''Third. To cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. These form, altogether, the fifth of the enumerated classes of causes proper for the cognizance of the national courts.''

''Fourth. To controversies to which the United States shall be a party. These constitute the third of those classes.''

''Fifth. To controversies between two or more States; between a State and citizens of another State; between citizens of different States. These belong to the fourth of those classes, and partake, in some measure, of the nature of the last.''

''Sixth. To cases between the citizens of the same State, CLAIMING LANDS UNDER GRANTS OF DIFFERENT STATES. These fall within the last class, and ARE THE ONLY INSTANCES IN WHICH THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION DIRECTLY CONTEMPLATES THE COGNIZANCE OF DISPUTES BETWEEN THE CITIZENS OF THE SAME STATE.''

''Seventh. To cases between a State and the citizens thereof, and foreign States, citizens, or subjects. These have been already explained to belong to the fourth of the enumerated classes, and have been shown to be, in a peculiar manner, the proper subjects of the national judicature.''

'''From this review of the particular powers of the federal judiciary, as marked out in the Constitution, it appears that they are all conformable to the principles which ought to have governed the structure of that department, and which were necessary to the perfection of the system. If some partial inconveniences should appear to be connected with the incorporation of any of them into the plan, it ought to be recollected that the national legislature will have ample authority to make such EXCEPTIONS, and to prescribe such regulations as will be calculated to obviate or remove these inconveniences. The possibility of particular mischiefs can never be viewed, by a well informed mind, as a solid objection to a general principle, which is calculated to avoid general mischiefs and to obtain general advantages.''

''PUBLIUS.''

== '''Appreciating Different Cultures&lt;/big&gt;''' ==


Today, the majority of workplaces are multicultural. Employees in the workplace are more likely to come from different backgrounds including cultural environments and different parts of the world. The textbook, Technical Communication by Paul V. Anderson, makes a point to emphasize cultural differences. It is important to take into account who a document will be read by.    

The following characteristics show differences between cultures and should be considered by effective writers:

*'''Amount of Detail Expected''' - High-context cultures such as Japan, China, and France provide little details in their writing. A high-context culture is based on fewer, deeper relations with people; there are many unspoken social rules and understandings within the culture. People in these cultures expect readers to have enough knowledge about the communication before they begin reading. In areas such as instructions, for example, it is assumed that readers have enough background knowledge or experience that there is no need to explain different tools used or walk the reader through any steps. People in low-context cultures such as the United States, Great Britain, and Germany assume readers know very little before they begin reading. Low-context cultures have a greater number of surface-level relations; rules are more explicitly defined so others know how to behave. People in low-context cultures expect detailed writing that explains the entire process. Writers should consider the cultural audience of their writing so that readers are not insulted by an excess or lack of information.

*'''Distance Between the Top and Bottom of Organizational Hierarchies''' - Many organizations in the United States and Western Europe have great distances with many layers between top-level management and low-level workers. When the distance is large, writing to employees above and below tends to be more formal. In cultures where companies are more flatly organized, communication between layers tends to be less formal.

*'''Individual versus Group Orientation''' - Many Asian and South American cultures are collectivist, meaning people pursue group goals and pay attention to the needs of the group. In individualistic cultures such as the United States and Northern Europe, people are more interested in personal achievement. Writers should know if they are writing to an audience that is &quot;me-oriented&quot; or one that is &quot;we-oriented.&quot;

*'''In-person Business Communications''' - There are several differences that one should be aware of when meeting a colleague with a different cultural background. For instance, some cultures stand very close to each other when talking and some prefer to have distance. Some cultures make eye contact with each other and some find it disrespectful. There are also certain cultures where an employee will not disagree or give feedback to their superior. It is seen as disrespectful. In these cultures, it is usually unacceptable to ask questions. 

*'''Preference for Direct or Indirect Statements''' - People in the United States and Northern Europe prefer direct communications, while people in Japan and Korea typically prefer indirect communications. When denying a request in the U.S., a writer will typically apologize, but firmly state that request was denied. In Japan, that directness may seem rude. A Japanese writer may instead write that the decision has not yet been made, delaying the answer with the expectation that the requester will not ask again. In Japan, this is viewed as more polite than flatly denying someone; however, in the United States this may give false hope to the requester, and the requester may ask again. 

*'''Basis of Business Decisions''' - In the United States and Europe, business decisions are typically made objectively with consideration given to cost, feasibility, timeliness, etc. In Arab cultures, business decisions are often made on the basis of personal relationships. Writers should know if a goal-oriented approach is best, or if a more personable communication would be preferred.

*'''Interpretation of Images, Gestures, and Words''' - Words, images, and gestures can mean different things in different cultures.  Knowing how images will be interpreted in another culture is crucial before sending documents to unfamiliar audiences. For example, hand gestures are interpreted differently around the world, and graphics showing hands should generally be avoided. Also, religiously affiliated wording can cause offense by readers. &quot;I've been blessed to work with you&quot; and comments that lend themselves to religious references should be avoided in the business setting.

== '''Gaining Knowledge about Intercultural Readers''' ==
It is often difficult to determine who will be reading your documents. It is important to distinguish your audience before writing. When writing to a wide variety of people, knowing their cultural biases, assumptions, and customs are essential.  There are a variety of resources online that provide cultural information about countries around the world. Understanding differences reduces the amount of miscommunication when doing global business. As an example, in the United States many times the date is written Month, Day, Year, but in other countries they write a date Day, Month, Year. Knowing this can reduce the confusion of when things are sent, due, and timelines. Learning information about other nationalities helps you relate to your readers as well as prepare you for the future. Readers will appreciate your knowledge about their customs. 

=== '''Online Sources''' ===
====[http://www.geert-hofstede.com Geert Hofstede Cultural Dimensions]====
Professor Geert Hofstede analyzed data from 50 countries provided by IBM. The study was one of the most comprehensive studies  ever conducted about cultures around the world. Professor Hofstede ranks cultures on Power Distance, Individualism, Masculinity, Uncertainty Avoidance, and Long-Term Orientation. The information gives insights into different cultures, allowing intercultural writing to be more effective.

====[http://www.cyborlink.com Cyborlink]====
Cyborlink provides information about international business etiquette and manners. Cyborlink is organized by country, allowing writers to quickly find their target audience. Cyborlink's information draws heavily on the studies performed by Professor Hofstede. Each country page provides information about appearances (clothing and gestures), behavior (dining, gift-giving, meetings, customs, and negotiations), and communication (greetings, introductions, and conversation guidelines) as well as country facts, additional resources, and analysis from Professor Hofstede.

====[http://globaledge.msu.edu/ globalEDGE]==== 
globalEDGE gathers information about international business from a wide variety of sources. The site was created by the International Business Center at Michigan State University and is partially funded by the U.S. Department of Education. The site is broken into several categories. The Resource Desk collects thousands of resources organized by topics in international business. It provides research, news, and reference material as well as glossary of terms used in international business. The Country Insights section provides data on 199 different countries. It includes statistics, economic and political conditions, and a brief country history. The culture section is useful for people writing to a multicultural audience; it provides information on business etiquette for each of the countries.

=== '''Other Sources'''===
Coworkers are a great source of intercultural information. People familiar with you and the company provide the best information about the expectations of your audience. If coworkers have previously written to your audience, they may be able to offer insight as to how your writing will be interpreted.

Previous communications kept by your company can also be a useful tool for determining how to write to another culture. If the writing was well received, you will able to look for clues as to how to structure your writing. Writing that resulted in a new partnership or a completed sale may be the best indicator of how to structure your writing.

=== '''Unknown Readers''' ===
It is not always possible to know who your reading audience may be. Many emails or memos written to your intended audience may go through numerous people. Although you may be targeting one type of audience, it is important to not forget about the &quot;phantom,&quot; &quot;future,&quot; and &quot;complex&quot; readers.

'''Phantom readers'''-
Real but unnamed readers are phantom readers. They are &quot;behind the scenes&quot; and their presence is usually unknown to a writer. Phantom readers are included in communications that require a decision. A clue to phantom readers presence is that the person written to is not high enough in organizational hierarchy to make a decision. It is important to meet the needs of the phantom readers because they may be the most important reader. 

'''Future Readers'''-
Written communications may still be used weeks, months or even years after being written. Every company document is considered a legal document, so lawyers and judges could be future readers. Future readers can also be employees who retrieve old communications for information or ideas. Writing communications with future readers in mind will save time and give documents an appeal that will please a wide range of readers.

'''Complex Audiences'''-
Addressing a group of people who will be reading from many perspectives is a complex audience. Focusing on writing to complex audiences will allow you to relate to people from many different backgrounds. It is important to relate to each reader while not taking away from your overall communication.


==='''Mindful Tips When Writing'''===

*'''Never Use Racial Profiling''': Racial slurs, profiling or any other form in a professional document are unacceptable in every instance. NO matter how comfortable you are with your audience. If the document were to come in the possession of unintended hands it could look highly negative upon you. The professional world on no level tolerates writing like this. Save it for your personal or individual writing.

*'''Never Use Profanity''': Again, this is not accepted in the professional world on any level. Even writing between co-workers, this can offend and look negatively upon you.

*'''Be Mindful and Respectful of Religious Beliefs''': Avoid words like ''bless, god, covet, bible, or any other religious connotations''. Avoid mentioning holiday names, for example; ''&quot;During the Christmas Season...&quot;'', but rather ''&quot;During this holiday season...&quot;''. This will ensure no one group feels excluded or discriminated against. Again, writing in this way is just professional courtesy.

*'''Avoid Slang''': This is a general tip for all writing, but avoiding slang terms will ensure your words are not misconstrued and taken other then what your intended meaning.

*'''Write As if the World is Reading''': Once you have written your ideas on any medium; computer, email, paper, etc., everyone has access to it. Remember your writing is becoming public knowledge. You have no idea who will run across your document, so ensure there is no compromising information.</text>

=Fischer Defense=
Fischer called 3... d6 &quot;a high-class waiting move.&quot; The idea of it is to avoid the Kieseritzky Gambit (1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 g5 4.h4 g4 5.Ne5) and free the queen's bishop, as well as giving an extra space for the king to run to if necessary.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Significance==
The Battle of Ballinamuck marked the defeat of the main force of the French incursion during the 1798 Rebellion in Ireland.

== victory of General Humbert ==

The victory of General Humbert at Castlebar, despite gaining him c. 5,000 Irish recruits had not led to a renewed outbreak of the rebellion as hoped. A massive British army of some 26,000 men was assembled under the new Viceroy Lord Cornwallis and was steadily moving towards his forces. Abandoning Castlebar, Humbert moved towards Ulster with the apparent intention of igniting a rising there but after defeating a blocking force of British troops at Collooney in Sligo he altered course following reports that rebellions had broken out in Westmeath and Longford.

17 French soldiers were killed in the brief fight, 96 French officers and 748 men were taken. British losses were initially reported as 3 killed and 16 wounded or missing, but the number of killed was later reported as 12. Approximately 500 Irish lay dead on the field, 200 prisoners were taken in the mopping up operations, almost all of whom were later hanged, including Matthew Tone, brother of Wolfe Tone. The prisoners were moved to Carrick-on-Shannon, St Johnstown, today's Ballinalee, where most were executed in what is known locally as Bullys Acre.

Humbert and his men were taken by canal to Dublin and repatriated. The British army then spread out into rebel held Mayo in a brutal campaign of killing and house burning which reached its climax on 23 September when Killala was stormed and retaken with much slaughter. Members of the French inspired &quot;Republic of Connaught&quot; such as George Blake, were hunted down and hanged with many other suspected insurgents.

The catastrophe at Ballinamuck left a strong imprint on social memory and featured strongly in local folklore. Numerous oral traditions were later collected about this episode, principally in in the 1930s by the historian Richard Hayes and by the Irish Folklore Commission.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Battle of Ballinalee was an engagement of the Irish War of Independence, fought by British soldiers and auxiliaries, against Seán Mac Eoin's North Longford Flying Column of the Irish Republican Army. The engagement took place in 1920, at the centre of Ballinalee village, County Longford, Ireland. The approx 100 British troops in 11 lorries hoped to burn the town as a reprisal, but were repulsed by approx 100 Irish (including those who occupied all roads leading into Ballinalee. The village was the only one in all of Ireland to repel the English outright.

:{{del}} I agree that in this case having duplicated materials is not a good idea. The current [[Basic HTML]] book is in terrible shape and new authors are going to look at it and say to themselves &quot;this book is terrible and I dn't want to deal with it.&quot; If we delete it, at least there will be a blank slate for a new author to start a new book about HTML at the basic-level. Having multiple HTML books targeted at different audiences is certainly acceptable, but this &quot;book&quot; isn't a good start for that. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:58, 12 September 2008 (UTC)

The '''Georgian&amp;ndash;Ossetian conflict''' refers to the ethno-political conflict in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia's]] former [[autonomous region]] of [[South Ossetia]], which evolved in [[1989]] and developed into a [[South Ossetian War|civil war]] in [[1991]]&amp;ndash;[[1992]]. Despite a declared [[ceasefire]] and numerous peace efforts, the conflict remains unresolved, minor armed incidents persist and a large part of the region is still out of control of the central [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] government. In [[2007]], the Georgian government held its first state commission to define South Ossetia's status within the Georgian state. In August the same year, diplomatic tensions between Georgia and [[Russia]] heightened as two [[Russia]]n fighter aircraft were accused of violating Georgian airspace, with one firing an [[anti-radiation missile]] onto Georgian territory south of the Ossetian conflict zone.

==Origins of the conflict==
{{Georgia-Russia}}
The [[South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast]] was created in 1922 after the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|Soviet occupation of Georgia]] in the part of historical Georgian province [[Shida Kartli]]. Generally speaking, [[Georgians]] and [[Ossetians]] have been living in peace with each other [[Georgian-Ossetian conflict (1918-1920)|except for the episodes in 1918&amp;ndash;1920]]. Both [[ethnicity|ethnicities]] have had a high level of interaction and a high rate of [[intermarriage]]s.

In the late 1980s, rising [[nationalism]] in the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (SSR) and country’s movement towards independence were opposed by the Ossetian nationalistic organization, [[Ademon Nykhas]] (Popular Front), which demanded greater autonomy for the region and finally, unification with Russia’s North Ossetia. On [[November 10]] [[1989]], the South Ossetian [[Supreme Soviet]] approved a decision to unite South Ossetia with the [[North Ossetian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]], part of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]]. However, a day later, the Georgian SSR Supreme Soviet revoked the decision and on 23 November, thousands of Georgian nationalists led by [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] and other opposition leaders marched to [[Tskhinvali]], the South Ossetian capital, to hold a meeting there. The Ossetians mobilized blocking the road and only the interference of [[Soviet Army]] units could avoid the clash between the two demonstrations. The Soviet commanders made Georgian demonstrators turn back. However, several people were wounded in subsequent clashes between Georgians and Ossetians.

On [[20 September]] [[1990]], the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast declared independence as the South Ossetian Democratic Soviet Republic, appealing to [[Moscow]] to recognise it as an independent subject of the [[Soviet Union]]. When the election of the Georgian Supreme Council took place in October 1990, it was boycotted by the South Ossetians. On [[December 10]] [[1990]], [[South Ossetia]] held its own elections, declared illegal by Georgia. A day later, Georgian Supreme Soviet canceled the results of the Ossetian elections and abolished South Ossetian autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972214,00.html Hastening The End of the Empire], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', January 28, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[December 11]] [[1990]], several bloody incidents occurred in and around [[Tskhinvali]]. Georgian government declared a [[state of emergency]] in the districts of [[Tskhinvali]] and [[Java, Georgia|Java]] on [[December 12]]. Georgian police and National Guards units were dispatched in the region to disarm Ossetian armed groups.

It should be noted that at the time of the [[dissolution of the USSR]], the [[United States]] government [[Stimson Doctrine|recognized as legitimate]] the pre-[[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] [[1933]] borders of the country (the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] government established diplomatic relations with the Kremlin at the end of that year&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,746345,00.html &quot;Pretty Fat Turkey&quot;], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', November 27, 1933 &lt;/ref&gt;). Because of this, the [[George H. Bush]] administration openly supported the restoration of independence of the [[Baltic countries|Baltic SSRs]], but regarded the questions related to the independence and territorial conflicts of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and the rest of the [[Transcaucasus]] — which were integral part of the USSR with international borders unaltered since the 1920s — as internal Soviet affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973116,00.html America Abroad], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', June 10, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==The conflict and tensions timeline==
===The 1991–1992 South Ossetia War===
{{main|1991–1992 South Ossetia War}}
{{expand section}}
The Ossetian&amp;ndash;Georgian tensions escalated into a 1991&amp;ndash;1992 war which killed some 3,000 people.
[[Image:SO2.jpg|thumb|left|300px| South Ossetia zones of control (according to Georgia)]]

===The ceasefire===
Georgian and [[Ossetian]] sides began [[Russia]]n and [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]]-mediated negotiations on peaceful regulation of the conflict on [[October 30]] [[1995]]. The major break through in negotiation happened in May 1996 when the two sides signed a 'Memorandum on measures for providing security and joint confidence' in which the two sides renounced the use of force. This was followed up by several meetings between then-President of Georgia, [[Eduard Shevardnadze]], and de facto President of [[South Ossetia]] [[Ludwig Chibirov]], and their respective heads of governments.

Refugees resettled in the zone of conflict but still only in small numbers, the major obstacle being the economic situation in the region. Numerous small steps of co-operation between Georgians and Ossetians took place.

The absence of central control over the region,{{Fact|date=August 2008}} the loose authority of the South Ossetian government,{{Fact|date=August 2008}} and the region’s contiguity to the Russian Federation, through North Ossetia,{{Fact|date=August 2008}} have made it a haven for organised criminal activity,{{Fact|date=August 2008}} specifically smuggling.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} The [[Ergneti, Georgia|Ergneti]] market on the outskirts of [[Tskhinvali]] was the main economic black hole{{Fact|date=July 2008}} into which vast amounts{{Fact|date=July 2008}} of Russian contraband{{Fact|date=July 2008}} fuel, cigarettes, alcohol and wheat flour were pouring{{Fact|date=July 2008}} – robbing Georgia of revenues{{Fact|date=July 2008}} and propping up{{Fact|date=July 2008}} the breakaway region.

=== The 2004 flare-up ===
{{verify section}}
[[Image:SouthOssetia region detailed map.JPG|thumb|Detailed map of South Ossetia showing the secessionist and Georgian-controlled territories.]]
In May 2004, following the success in another poorly-controlled province of [[Ajara]], President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]]’s government turned their attention to [[South Ossetia]]. Saakashvili offered humanitarian aid to both the Georgian and [[Ossetian]] population and promised to give the region broad autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4209243.stm ''Georgia unveils settlement offer''], The [[BBC News]], [[January 25]], [[2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-June, Georgian police shut down the Ergneti market, which was a major trading point for tax-free goods from [[Russia]].  They established strong measures to combat smuggling, the mainstay of the local economy.{{cn}}

These Georgian actions made the situation more tense. In retaliation, South Ossetian forces closed the highway between Russia and Georgia for several days. Georgia's regional administration began to restore the roads between Georgian-populated Patara Liakhvi and Didi Liakhvi gorges by-passing separatist-controlled capital [[Tskhinvali]] and dispatched military patrols to control them.
On July 7, Georgian peacekeepers intercepted a [[Russia]]n convoy carrying military equipment, including missiles, which led to tensions between [[Tbilisi]] and [[Moscow]]. The next day, around 50 Georgian peacekeepers were disarmed and detained by the [[South Ossetia]]n militias.
In retaliation, Saakashvili refused to attend peace talks. Large numbers of Georgian and Ossetian forces moved into the border areas, and there was frequent shooting for several days. The Georgian soldiers captured were all released on [[July 9]], with three exceptions.
[[Image:Georgian_sniper_during_South_Ossetia_war.jpg|left|thumb|A Georgian sniper takes aim at Ossetian rebels.]]

Tensions between [[Tbilisi]] and [[Moscow]] continued to worsen when the Russian [[Duma]] passed a resolution supporting the [[South Ossetia]]n secessionists. The fellow unrecognized states [[Abkhazia]] and [[Transnistria]], [[Cossack]] communities of Russia and the North Ossetians promised to support South Ossetia if Georgia attacked. Hundreds of Russian volunteers, mainly [[Cossacks]], arrived in South Ossetia to defend the separatist government.

A ceasefire deal was reached on August 13, after three nights of gun and mortar fire. The agreement was signed by Georgian Prime Minister [[Zurab Zhvania]] and South Ossetian de facto President [[Eduard Kokoity]]. However, the agreement was violated shortly after the signing. The bloodiest clashes occurred on August 18 and [[August 19. On August 19, after the overnight fighting with several killed and wounded on the both sides, Georgian forces seized a strategic hill near the Ossetian village of Trianakhana, from which the South Ossetian militias and volunteers were shelling Georgian villages. However, shortly after the successful operation, President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] announced that Georgia will give “a last chance for peace” to the South Ossetians and added that [[Tbilisi]] will pullout its non-peacekeeping troops from the conflict zone in exchange of peace. Georgian troops handed over strategic hilltops in the conflict zone to the joint peacekeeping forces late on the same day.  As reported, 16 Georgians and dozens of Ossetian and Russian volunteers died during the August fighting.

At a high level meeting between Georgian Prime Minister [[Zurab Zhvania]] and South Ossetian leader [[Eduard Kokoity]] on [[5 November]] in [[Sochi]], [[Russia]], an agreement on demilitarisation of the conflict zone was signed. Some exchange of fire continued in the zone of conflict, apparently primarily initiated by the Ossetian side.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/UNTC/UNPAN019224.pdf ''Georgia: Avoiding War in South Ossetia''], [[International Crisis Group]] Report N&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;159, [[26 November]], [[2004]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===New peace efforts===
Georgian President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] presented a new vision for resolving the South Ossetian conflict at the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] (PACE) session in [[Strasbourg]], on [[January 26]] [[2005]]. His proposal included broader forms of autonomy, including a constitutional guarantee of free and directly elected local self-governance. Saakashvili stated that South Ossetia's parliament would have control over issues such as culture, education, social policy, economic policy, public order, organization of local self-governance and environmental protection. At the same time [[South Ossetia]] would have a voice in the national structures of government as well, with a constitutional guarantee of representation in the judicial and constitutional-judicial branches and in the Parliament. Georgia would commit to improving the economic and social conditions of South Ossetian inhabitants. Saakashvili proposed a transitional 3-year conflict resolution period, during which time mixed Georgian and Ossetian police forces, under the guidance and auspices of international organizations, would be established and Ossetian forces would gradually be integrated into a united Georgian Armed Forces. Saakashvili also said that the international community should play a more &quot;significant&quot; and &quot;visible&quot; role in solving this conflict.

As hostage incidents, minor skirmishes and organized criminal activities continued to plague the region,{{cn}} Georgia insisted that the Russian-led peacekeeping operation and the format of negotiations had exhausted their potential.  They believed the U.S. and the OSCE ought to play a more active role in the resolution of the conflict. Saakashvili's government intensified international efforts on the South Ossetian problem. On [[October 27]] [[2005]], Prime Minister [[Zurab Nogaideli]] presented a Georgian action plan at the OSCE Permanent Council at [[Vienna]]; the U.S. government and the OSCE expressed their support.  On [[December 6]], [[2005]], the OSCE Ministerial Council in [[Ljubljana]] unanimously adopted a resolution supporting the Georgian peace plan for South Ossetia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===2006 attack on a Georgian helicopter===
On [[September 3]], [[2006]], the South Ossetian forces opened fire at a Georgian [[Mil Mi-8|MI-8]] helicopter carrying Defense Minister of Georgia, [[Irakli Okruashvili]], and the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Georgian armed forces, when it flew over the separatist-held territory. Although the South Ossetian authorities reported that the Georgian helicopter was &quot;shot down&quot;, it was only slightly damaged and landed safely in Georgian government-controlled territory. Later, the South Ossetian officials confirmed their troops were responsible for the attack, alleging that the helicopter had entered their air space, but rejected the claim that the aircraft was targeted because of prior intelligence that Okruashvili was on board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/EKOI-6TJ87B?OpenDocument Georgia-South Ossetia: Helicopter attack sparks hostile words].

===2006 October incident===
[[Image:Saboteurs1.jpg|thumb|left|Islamic literature allegedly seized from the militants.]]
[[Image:Saboteurs2.jpg|thumb|right|Weapons seized from the militants.]]
On [[October 31]], [[2006]], the South Ossetian police reported a skirmish in the [[Java, Georgia|Java]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] district in which they killed a group of 4 men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.com/p718122/r_527/South_Ossetia_Militants_Talks/ ''South Ossetia Announces Thwarting a Terrorist Plot''], Kommersant, [[November 1]], [[2006]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://euronews.net/create_html.php?page=detail_info&amp;article=388244&amp;lng=1#/ ''Four Chechen gunmen killed in South Ossetia''], [[EuroNews]], [[November 1]], [[2006]].&lt;/ref&gt; The weapons seized from the group included assault rifles, guns, grenade launchers, grenades and explosive devices. Other items found in the militants' possession included extremist Islamic literature, maps of Java district and sets of Russian peacekeeping uniforms. Those findings led the South Ossetian authorities to conclude that the militants were planning to carry out acts of sabotage, thus raising tensions ahead of the [[South Ossetian independence referendum, 2006|independence referendum]] scheduled for [[November 12]] , [[2006]]. The South Ossetian authorities identified the men as [[Kist people|Kist]] Chechens, many of whom live in Georgia's [[Pankisi Gorge]]. South Ossetia has accused Georgia of hiring the Chechen mercenaries to carry out terrorist attacks in the region. Russia has previously accused Georgia of harbouring Chechen separatists in the gorge.{{cn}}

The Georgian side flatly denied its involvement in the incident. Shota Khizanishvilia, a spokesperson for the Georgian Interior Ministry, supposed that the incident could be connected to &quot;internal conflicts in South Ossetia&quot;.{{cn}}

===Rival elections of 2006===
{{verify section}}
On [[November 12]], [[2006]], two rival elections and simultaneous referendums were held in South Ossetia. The separatist-controlled part of the region reelected [[Eduard Kokoity]] as de facto president and voted for independence from Georgia. In the areas under Georgia's control, the Ossetian opposition, with unofficial backing from Tbilisi, organized rival polls electing [[Dmitry Sanakoyev]], the former premier in the secessionist government, as an &quot;alternative president&quot; and voted for negotiations with Georgia on a future federal agreement. Both Tskhinvali and Moscow denounced the move as Georgia's attempt to install &quot;a puppet government&quot; in the conflict zone. The alternative government quickly organized a civic movement involving both Georgians and Ossetians (including the Ossetian NGOs active in Tbilisi and elsewhere in Georgia), with the declared aim of restoring peace in the region and reintegrating South Ossetia into Georgia on the basis of broad autonomy.

===Georgia's new initiative===
On [[May 10]] [[2007]], Dmitry Sanakoyev was appointed as Head of the South Ossetian Provisional Administrative Entity by the [[President of Georgia]]. The next day, Sanakoyev addressed the [[Parliament of Georgia]] in [[Ossetic language|Ossetic]], outlining his vision of the conflict resolution plan ([http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=15101see full text]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=15100 Head of S.Ossetia Administration Addresses Georgian Parliament]. ''Civil Georgia''. [[May 11]] [[2007]]. Retrieved on [[May 12]], [[2007]].&lt;/ref&gt; This move earned approval from the [[United States]] [[State Department]],{{cn}} but alarmed the de facto authorities in Tskhinvali.{{cn}}  The South Ossetian separatists ordered that traffic to ethnic Georgian villages be blocked, and threatened to oust Sanakoyev’s government by force.{{cn}}  However, this met with Russia's disapproval.{{clarify-inline}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.com/p764705/Ossetia/ Eduard Kokoity Makes Siege Mistake]. ''[[Kommersant]]''. Retrieved on [[May 12]], [[2007]].&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[July 24]] [[2007]], Tbilisi held its first state commission to define South Ossetia's status within the Georgian state. Chaired by Georgian Prime Minister [[Zurab Noghaideli]], the commission included ruling National Movement Party lawmakers, an opposition party member, civil society advocates, Dmitry Sanakoyev, and representatives of the Ossetian community in Georgia. Georgian officials announced that they would welcome the involvement of Kokoity's envoys, but the Tskhinvali government refused to participate. In response, Sanakoyev's supporters launched a campaign &quot;Kokoity Fanderast&quot; or &quot;Kokoity Farewell&quot; in Ossetian.

In [[August 2007]], the Georgian government and the provisional administration initiated a major plan to rehabilitate the conflict zone: throughout Georgian-controlled areas of South Ossetia, they resurfaced roads, and began constructing a cinema, discotheque, electronics store, 25-bed hospital, secondary school, sports center, bank, children’s amusement park, swimming pool, two gas stations, and gas and water lines.{{update-inline}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tol.cz/look/TOL/article.tpl?IdLanguage=1&amp;IdPublication=4&amp;NrIssue=229&amp;NrSection=1&amp;NrArticle=18873 Power Struggle Simmers On], by Paul Rimple. ''Transitions Online'', [[August 1]] [[2007]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tsitelubani missile incident 2007===
{{main|2007 Georgia missile incident}}

On [[August 7]], [[2007]], a missile landed, but did not explode, in the Georgian-controlled village of [[Tsitelubani]], some 65&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Tbilisi]]. Georgian officials said that two Russian fighter jets violated its airspace and fired a missile, targeting a nearby Georgian radar outpost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://civil.ge/eng/detail.php?id=15579 Report Gives Some Details on Missile Strike]. ''Civil Georgia''. [[August 9]], [[2007]].&lt;/ref&gt; Russian and South Ossetian authorities accused Georgia of staging a [[false flag operation]] in order to provoke tension in the region.  Two investigative groups from [[NATO]] countries reported that the jet entered Georgian airspace from Russia, but Russian officials rejected this conclusion, citing their own investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===2008 clashes===
[[Image:040 South Ossetia war.JPG|thumb|250px|Men from the 113th elite bataillon from the Georgian army are charging up a hill where Ossetian rebels are entrenched. They are shooting from their positions on top on that hill.]]
On the night of [[June 14]] into the early morning of [[June 15]] [[2008]], mortar fire and an exchange of gunfire were reported between South Ossetian and Georgian forces. South Ossetia reported that mortar fire was launched from Georgian-controlled villages on Tshinkvali, the South Ossetian capital, and that their forces came under fire from Georgian forces on the outskirts of the capital. Georgia denies firing the first shot claiming instead that South Ossetia had attacked the Georgian-controlled villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=18548|title=One Dies, Four Injured in S.Ossetia Shootout|publisher=Civil Georgia|date=[[2008-06-16]]|accessdate=2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian, Georgian, and North Ossetia peacekeepers as well as [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] monitors went to the site of the clashes, but it was not determined who fired the first shot. One person was killed and four wounded during the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jyl-ia34FGB728ru_85p2zz_v8IQ|title=Crossfire kills one in Georgian breakaway region|publisher=Agence France-Presse|date=[[2008-06-15]]|accessdate=2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A South Ossetian police official was killed in a bomb attack on [[July 3]], 2008 and this was followed by an intense exchange of gun fire. Later a convoy carrying the leader of the Tbilisi-backed South Ossetian provisional administration, Dimitri Sanakoev, was attacked and three of his security guards injured. On [[July 4]], [[2008]] two people were killed as a result of shelling and shooting in Tskhinvali and some villages in South Ossetia. The South Ossetian Press and Information Committee reported that a South Ossetian militiaman had been killed and another injured in an attack on a police post in the village of Ubia and this was followed by the shelling of Tskhinvali, which resulted in the death of one man. The shelling reportedly involved the use of mortars and grenade launchers. Georgia claimed it had opened fire in response to the shelling by South Ossetian militiamen of Georgian-controlled villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=18677|title=Two Killed in Overnight Shelling in S.Ossetia|publisher=Civil Georgia|date=[[2008-07-04]]|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Ossetia called up military reservists and put its security forces on alert in response to the clashes. The head of Russia's peacekeeping troops in the region was quoted as saying extra soldiers could be deployed if the stand-off worsened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080704.wgeorgia0704/BNStory/International/home|title=Russia accuses Georgia of open aggression|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=[[2008-07-04]]|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Ossetia warned it would move heavy weaponry into the conflict zone with Georgia if attacks on the republic were not stopped.

The Georgian Ministry of Defense said on [[July 7]] [[2008]] a group of up to ten militiamen were apparently prevented from placing mines on a Georgian-controlled by-pass road linking the Georgian villages in the north of Tskhinvali with the rest of Georgia. The Georgian side opened fire and the group was forced to retreat towards the nearby South Ossetian-controlled village. On [[July 8]], 2008 South Ossetia reported that it had detained four “officers from the artillery brigade of the Georgian Ministry of Defense” close to the village of Okona in the Znauri district at the administrative border the night before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=18718|title=S.Ossetia Claims it Holds Four Georgian Soldiers|publisher=Civil Georgia|date=[[2008-07-08]]|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili told police to prepare an operation to free the four soldiers, but they were released before an operation was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/asiaCrisis/idUSL08676780|title=Georgia plans operation to free detained soldiers|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=[[2008-07-08]]|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian military jets flew into Georgian airspace through South Ossetia on [[July 9]] [[2008]] and then returned to Russia. The next day, the Russian authorities confirmed the flight and said, in an official statement, that the fighters were sent to prevent Georgia from launching an operation to free the four soldiers detained by South Ossetia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.messenger.com.ge/issues/1646_july_11_2008/1646_russia_overflights.html|title=Russia says it sent warplanes over South Ossetia to ‘prevent bloodshed’|publisher=The Messenger|date=[[2008-07-11]]|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Georgia recalled its ambassador to Moscow &quot;for consultations&quot;, stating that it was &quot;outraged by Russia's agressive policies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=18751 Georgia Recalls Ambassador from Moscow]. Civil Georgia. [[2008-07-10]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident coincided with the visit of the [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] to Tbilisi where she pledged the U.S. support for Georgia's bid to join [[NATO]]. She said that granting [[NATO Membership Action Plan]] to Georgia would help resolve the Abkhaz and South Ossetian problems. The statement caused a negative outcry in Moscow: the Russian foreign minister [[Sergey Lavrov]] responded, during his meeting with the de facto Abkhaz president [[Sergey Bagapsh]], that Georgia’s NATO integration process &quot;may undermine the conflict resolution&quot; process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=18749 May Undermine Conflict Resolution]. Civil Georgia. [[2008-07-10]].&lt;/ref&gt; On [[July 11]], [[2008]], Georgian Deputy Foreign Minister [[Grigol Vashadze]] called for an urgent UN Security Council meeting on the conflict zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gs9VScoLa74Nu8tNFmB4QOXKJ42Q|title=Georgia seeks urgent UN meeting on tension with Russia|publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]]|date=[[2008-07-12]]|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A South Ossetian envoy on July 11, 2008 declared that South Ossetia was capable of repelling any attack by Georgia without help from Moscow and also said the mainly Russian peacekeeping contingent in the Georgian-South Ossetian conflict zone should be increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20080711/113784564.html|title=S.Ossetia could repel Georgia attack without Russian help - envoy|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|date=[[2008-07-11]]|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian Ministry of Defense said in a statement the same day that measures have been taken “to increase combat readiness” of the Russian peacekeeping forces stationed in Abkhazia. It also said that security had been tightened at the Russian peacekeepers’ base camps, observation posts and checkpoints, and “additional training” of the peacekeeping personnel had been conducted “to explain regulations of use of firearm while on duty.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=18758|title=Russian MoD: Troops on Combat Readiness in Abkhazia|publisher=Civil Georgia|date=[[2008-07-11]]|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nika Rurua, Deputy Head of the Parliament’s Security and Defense Committee, warned that Georgia would shoot down Russia’s military aircraft in case they appear in its airspace again and an initiative was considered to this effect, but decided instead to appeal to the world community on the matter. Media reports published information about Russia’s alleged plans to seize the Kodori Gorge specifying that the details of the operation were worked out by Russian high-ranking military officials, with Abkhazia’s President Sergey Bagapsh. Russia is reportedly planning to respond by revealing the details of a planned military invasion of South Ossetia by Georgia to release their detained officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kommersant.com/p911803/Georgia_and_Russia_are_teetering_on_the_brink_of_war/|title=“Georgia Is Able to Shoot Down Violators”|publisher=[[Kommersant]]|date=[[2008-07-12]]|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[July 14]], [[2008]] Georgia's deputy defense minister Batu Kutelia said Georgia plans to expand its military more than 15 percent to 37,000 soldiers following events in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The additional manpower would be used to defend Georgia's airspace and the Black Sea coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&amp;sid=a3AYHBQLQAt4&amp;refer=europe|title=Georgia to Expand Military to Counter Russian Threat in Regions |publisher=[[Bloomberg]]|date=[[2008-07-14]]|accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[July 15]], [[2008]] the U.S. and Russia both began exercises in the Caucasus though Russia denies the timing was intentional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hl2IaaI7mzhpleTStjpbg4qAxt2A|title=Russia, US hold rival war games in restive Caucasus: officials|publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]]|date=[[2008-07-15]]|accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian exercises included training to support peacekeepers in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

According to media reports, on [[July 19]], [[2008]] a Georgian police post was attacked by Abkhaz militias using grenades, one of the militiamen died from a grenade exploding accidentally. Abkhaz officials condemned the reports as false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=18818|title=Georgian TV Reports: Police Post Attacked on Abkhaz Border|publisher=Civil Georgia|date=[[2008-07-20]]|accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgian media also reported on July 19 that a battalion of Russian troops had moved into the lower Kodori Gorge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewiStockNews+articleid_2413551~title_Georgian-TV-Company.html|title=Georgian TV Company Alleges Russian Battalion Brought into Abkhazia|publisher=iStockAnalyst|date=[[2008-07-19]]|accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia's Defense Ministry claimed Russian troops encroached on Mamison and Roksky passes in Abkhazia and South Ossetia respectively and are in combat alert. Abkhazia's Foreign Minister said no new troops were brought in over the quota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kommersant.com/p914485/Georgia_Troops_Russia/|title=Georgia Raises Alarm|publisher=[[Kommersant]]|date=[[2008-07-21]]|accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A U.N. report issued [[July 23]], [[2008]] on the period between April and July 2008 noted discrepancies with the Georgian attack of a shooting in Khurcha on the day of Georgian elections. In particular the report noted the way the incident was filmed suggested the attack was anticipated. The report said reconnaissance flights by Georgia were a violation of the ceasefire, but said the shooting down of those fights also constituted a breach of the ceasefire. Concerning a military buildup by Georgia the UN report said it found no evidence of a buildup but noted observers were denied access to certain areas of Abkhazia controlled by Georgia including the Kvabchara Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=18857|title=UN Observers on Polling Day Abkhaz Shooting|publisher=Civil Georgia|date=[[2008-07-29]]|accessdate=2008-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[July 28 ]], [[2008]]  a spokesman for the Russian peacekeepers in South Ossetia said South Ossetian forces had blocked peacekeepers and OSCE observers from the village of Cholibauri which is close to where Georgia says South Ossetia is building fortifications.&lt;ref name=Georgia&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=18854|title=Georgians fire on South Ossetian villages - S.Ossetian president|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|date=[[2008-07-29]]|accessdate=2008-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[July 29]], [[2008]] South Ossetia said two South Ossetian villages had been fired on by Georgian forces in response to South Ossetia reinforcing its positions on the perimeter of the conflict zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20080729/115197261.html|title=Georgia reports Shootout in S.Ossetia|publisher=Civil Georgia|date=[[2008-07-29]]|accessdate=2008-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia said the same day that Georgian posts on the Sarabuki heights were attacked by South Ossetian forces with no injuries reported.&lt;ref name=Georgia /&gt;

=== August 2008 flare-up in violence ===
{{Main|War in South Ossetia (2008)}}
Six Ossetians were reportedly killed and 21 injured as a result of one of an intensive shootout in the South Ossetian conflict zone, late on [[August 1]] and overnight on [[August 2]]. Both sides have blamed each other for opening fire first.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=18871&lt;/ref&gt;

Sporadic fighting countinued every day and on August 6, there were further shootouts and Georgia acknowledged it had lost an [[APC]] during the clashes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=18924&lt;/ref&gt; After a night of gunfire in which four people died, shelling resumed at daybreak on August 7. Residents were on the move, evacuating vulnerable areas of the South Ossetian capital.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.russiatoday.ru/news/news/28607&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia was reportedly moving tanks, artillery and troops to the border with South Ossetia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.russiatoday.ru/news/news/28601&lt;/ref&gt;

However, at the end of the day, Mikhail Saakashvili ordered an unilateral cease-fire. “A sniper war is ongoing against residents of the villages [in the South Ossetian conflict zone] and as I speak now intensive fire is ongoing from artillery, from tanks, from self-propelled artillery systems – which have been brought in the conflict zone illegally – and from other types of weaponry, including from mortars and grenade launchers,” Saakashvili said in a live televised address made at 7:10pm local time on August 7.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=18931&lt;/ref&gt;

The ceasefire was broken hours later. Georgia said Separatist forces had been attacking Georgian villages despite of the ceasefire announcement, with several casualties reported. Thus it was beginning an operation to &quot;restore constitutional order in the whole region.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/news/international/Georgia_starts_operation_in_South_Ossetia.html?siteSect=143&amp;sid=9444482&amp;cKey=1218143244000&amp;ty=ti&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgia started a full-scale attack on the breakaway republic overnight, using tanks, aircraft, heavy artillery and infantry.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.rian.ru/russia/20080808/115890817.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgian military attacked a Russian base in Tshinval with artillery and missiles on August 8.{{Cn}} Several Russian soldiers were reported dead or wounded.&lt;ref&gt;http://rian.ru/defense_safety/20080808/150187374.html&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia argued that the Russian peacekeepers were not a neutral force, supporting this with claims that 60% of South Ossetian funding comes from Moscow.{{Cn}}

Georgian military forces attacked suddenly with the strong support of the heavy artillery ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BM-21 122mm] and 152mm), tanks and aircrafts. Within the first 2 hours main Ossetian bunkers were completly destroyed. Most of Tshinval (the main strategic point) communications and facilities were also heavy damaged. Central hospital, University and some schools were also among them. After the third artillery wave, two Georgian heavy tanks regiments begun their attack in converging directions around Tshinval and almost complete planned encirclement. It was only Russian peacemakers who could withstood upon Georgian main attack forces and saved several bunkers. There were several testimonies, as reported by the Russian side, that Georgian soldiers finished off some peacemakers and civilians that were unconscious or injured during Georgia artillery firing.

As a respond for unexpected attack on the peacemakers (which costs 15 killed and 150 injured) Russia engaged a part of 58th Army (150 tanks) into Ossetia and forced Georgian attack battalions to withdraw into their initial positions.{{fact}}

=Back Matter: Appendices, Glossaries and More=

Back Matter is an important part of a professional business document, and any other long document. It may contain one or more of the following: appendices, bibliography, works cited, reference list, end notes, glossary, list of symbols, or indices. These elements are used for citing sources, giving definitions to uncommon words, and giving the reader a list of topics and where they are in the document. All may not be read by every reader, but they are still important parts to include. Back Matter is for the reader that wants to know more. You may decide to add more or less to a document depending on the situation. 

How back matter strengthens a document:
*Guides readers to the information they need
*Expands on the information in the document
*Leads readers to other documents on the topic

==Appendices==

Appendices are used to give more detailed information about a specific topic that was not included in the main body of the paper. Appendices are for giving extra information to your reader that doesn't need to be in the main body of the document. This is not necessary information, but some readers may find it interesting or useful depending on their profession or context for reading your report. In the body of the documents there will be a reference that will lead interested reader's to the added information.  Appendices can also be an easy way to find reference materials in a more direct fashion. A series of titles that correspond to the references in the body are listed at the back of the document. Other uses of an appendix sometimes accompanies a figure located the paper. Also, appendices may contain calculations used for derivations given in the body of the document.

The appendix should be given its own section in a document and should be labeled &quot;Appendix&quot; at the top. Each appendix should be included in the table of contents. If there are multiple appendices they should be arranged in such a way that they correspond with the order they appear in the text of the paper. Each new appendix should start on a new page. The appendices should also be labeled in a way that shows order. For example, they can be labeled: Appendix A, Appendix B, Appendix C or Appendix I, Appendix II, Appendix III, also Arabic numerals are acceptable. This way, when finding information, it should be easy to navigate from the body of the paper to the appendix, and vice versa.

Example of what can be found in an appendix:
*Calculations
*Data analysis
*Graphs 
*Figures
*Photographs
*Maps
*Surveys
*Personal reflection
*Interviews

==Reference List, Endnotes, Bibliography==

These elements are used to cite the information used to write the document. It is very important to always cite initial sources of information. Books, magazine articles, authored web pages, and other print materials are most commonly used to gather information. The reference list, endnotes, and bibliography are put at the very end of a document.

===Bibliography===
Bibliographies are used to reference the sources used in document. They are found at the end of any document. Any reference used in the document should be documented in the bibliography. They are written in the form of a list, some being numbered while others are in alphabetical order. This allows readers to look up more information on the topic and shows that the information used is credible. All types of work can be in a bibliography, including: websites, books, articles, magazine, newspapers, speeches, interviews, videos, blogs, and many more.

There are many different formats that can be used when creating a bibliography. One of the most common styles used in scientific documents is APA, which is discussed later on this page. However, all documentation styles require some of the same information. Bibliography citations should include:
*Author
*Title
*Publisher
*Date of publication

Citations can be easily inserted into documents with the reference tool included in Microsoft Word and many other word processors. This tool allows you to insert information about a source into a simple form and insert a bibliography. The tool will automatically format the information according to the style chosen by the user.

===Endnotes===
Endnotes must be listed numerically both in your document and in your endnote citation. Each endnote should have a new number, even if you had previously listed that same citation earlier in the document. Endnote numbers must be superscripted. In your text, add a superscripted number immediately after the quote or reference cited with no space. Endnotes must be added on a separate Endnotes or Notes page at the end of your document just before the Works Cited or Bibliography page. Here is an example of a text with endnotes and the endnote citation:

====Text Example====
The Many Facets of Taboo:
The World Book Encyclopedia defines Taboo as &quot;an action, object, person, or place forbidden by law or culture.&quot;1 An encyclopedia of the occult points out that taboo is found among many other cultures including the ancient Egyptians, Jews and others.2 Mary Douglas has analyzed the many facets and interpretations of taboos across various cultures. She points out that the word &quot;taboo&quot; originates from the Polynesian languages meaning a religious restriction.3 She finds that &quot;taboos flow from social boundaries and support the social structure.&quot;4 In reference to Freak Shows at circuses, Rothenberg makes the observation that people who possess uncommon features and who willingly go out in public to display such oddities to onlookers are acting as &quot;modern-day taboo breakers&quot; by crossing the &quot;final boundary between societal acceptance and ostracism.&quot;5 In traditional British East Africa, between the time of puberty and marriage, a young Akamba girl must maintain an avoidance relationship with her own father.6 Looking at taboo in a modern society, Marvin Harris gives an interesting example of the application of cultural materialism to the Hindu taboo against eating beef.7

===Reference List===

The reference list should appear at the end of a paper. It provides the information necessary for a reader to locate and retrieve any sources cited in the body of the paper. Each source cited in the paper must appear in your reference list; likewise, each entry in the reference list must be cited in your text.

References should begin on a new page separate from the text of the essay; label this page &quot;References&quot; centered at the top of the page (do NOT bold, underline, or use quotation marks for the title).

Basic Rules according to the APA style:

•All lines after the first line of each entry in your reference list should be indented one-half inch from the left margin. This is called hanging indentation. 

•Authors' names are inverted (last name first); give the last name and initials for all authors of a particular work if it has three to seven authors. If the work has more than seven authors, list the first six authors and then use elipses after the sixth author's name. After the ellipses, list the last author's name of the work. 

•Reference list entries should be alphabetized by the last name of the first author of each work. 

•If you have more than one article by the same author, single-author references or multiple-author references with the exact same authors in the exact same order are listed in order by the year of publication, starting with the earliest. 

•When referring to any work that is NOT a journal, such as a book, article, or Web page, capitalize only the first letter of the first word of a title and subtitle, the first word after a colon or a dash in the title, and proper nouns. Do not capitalize the first letter of the second word in a hyphenated compound word. 

•Capitalize all major words in journal titles. 

•Italicize titles of longer works such as books and journals. 

•Do not italicize, underline, or put quotes around the titles of shorter works such as journal articles or essays in edited collections.

==Glossary or List of Symbols==

===Glossary===
In writing, especially professional documents, you will be using words that are unfamiliar with your reader. If an unfamiliar word in your text is used a minimal amount of times you can describe the meaning right next to the usage. When you use unfamiliar words throughout the entire text, you must place a definition in the glossary because it can get quite repetitious to continue to state the definition throughout the entire text.  In professions, ie: the sciences, your readers may not understand the definition to fancy scientific terms. By using glossary's, it enables you to provide a definition where readers can easily locate it if they need to.

===List of Symbols===
Similar to unfamiliar words, they are unfamiliar symbols used in professional writing. If the symbols are used throughout the whole document a list of symbols should be put in the back of the document. When creating a list of symbols, it should be easy to navigate through. Some ways to promote easy navigation is by listing the symbols in alphabetical order. Also you want to create the list of symbols in two columns, the left column should be the symbol and on the right column should correspond to the letter and be the definition or meaning of the symbol.

==Index==

An index is a useful communication technique used when your writing is too long for your readers to skim through quickly.  An index gives your readers a quick path to certain words or phrases that are easily accessible. When creating an index for a professional document, identify the kind of information that your readers will want to locate. This may also require you to look up words that mean the same thing. This work is compared to that of search queries online. These search queries provide results for a number of search able words. For example, if two people from different backgrounds are looking in the index for an answer, you must take into account that the people may be looking under different words. Indexes need to take into account its readers and the words choices they may be looking for.

Desktop publishing programs also can help you create an index by making a alphabetized list of words used throughout your publication. From these lists, you can see commonly used words and provide other words alternatives that your reader may be searching for.

=Usability Testing of Technical Communications=

'''What is Usability Testing?
'''

Usability testing is a tool used to evaluate a set of instructions or product.  It tests to see if these instructions or product do what it is designed to do. Usability tests are a necessary part of the process of writing instructions or developing a product.   

'''What is the Purpose of Usability Testing?'''

Usability testing involves test readers who read and/or use a draft in a similar situation as the intended audience would be in. After the test, you gather important information by observing and questioning the test reader. This allows you to get a good sense of the overall response of your draft so you can revise areas that need improvement. Usability testing can be simple or complex depending on the situation and importance.


'''Why is usability testing such a big deal and who uses it?'''

You may think your writing is easy to understand but more importantly, does your reader? Does your draft work the way it is intended to? The only accurate way to answer this question is to have a test subject read and evaluate your draft. Primary draft testing is the best method to increase the quality of a final draft that will be read and studied by thousands of people. Test materials range from drafts of websites, to print instructions, to informational documents.

Everybody from fortune 500 companies to college students use usability testing in order to improve the efficiency of their final draft. Big corporations treat testing as such a big deal that they build special buildings for the sole purpose of usability testing. These special facilities can be equipped with video cameras, monitored computers, as well as one-way mirrors so testing specialist employees can observe customers' responses to drafts. College students can use this strategy with a roommate or classmates. Whatever the situation, usability testing is proven to be a valuable tool in the writing world.

==Preparing for Usability Testing==

'''Establish your test objectives'''
Create questions or concerns that you want answered as a result of your usability testing. Be prepared however, often times questions arise during the testing process. Pay close attention to what your tester is telling you, this is valuable information to help improve your instructions. Make sure to annotate these questions/concerns in your observations, because this should be red flag that issues exist in a particular section that '''must''' be addressed. Once you realize what you want to learn, you can customize the test so it evaluates and gives you the specific information you are looking to obtain. The two most general questions usability testing seeks to answer are:

* How can my draft be improved?
* Is my communication sufficient?

Other examples of more specific question are:

* How well is the page formatted? 
* Does the draft influence the test readers’ attitude the way I intended it to?
* Are my tasks easy to follow?

To help evaluate this criterion you may create measurable criteria. Measurable criteria can involve having a test reader read an informative draft and having him answer questions. Make sure the criteria is highly specific to your objectives. Criteria that is too broad will prove to be invaluable when assessing the problem later on. If he gets a certain percentage correct, the draft is adequate. It can also be time related. For instance, can the test reader navigate to the website link I provided within twenty seconds?

'''Pick suitable target readers that fit with the testing situation'''
This is a very important part of the testing because if a test reader is not a part of the target audience, then they may influence you to make ineffective adjustments to your paper. A vital rule for most cases is to pick a dentist for dentistry or an electrician for electrical instructions. Furthermore, the knowledge levels of your target readers on the subject you want to test them on should varied according to the the objective of your testing. For example, you are constructing an origami instruction for individuals with intermediate origami level, and you want to test the clearly of your instruction with a usability testing. If you select test readers with no origami experience, your instructions will seen overly complicated to the readers and the outcome of the usability testing will send you a message that additional clarification is needed where in actuality your the amount of information/explanation in your instruction might just be sufficient for your target audience. Similarly, testing the clearly of your instruction with test readers in advanced origami can lead you to over simplify your instruction. This is to say that you have to make sure the test reader is not too familiar with the subject so that he already knows what to expect. If the reader is already familiar with the project, he may not have any difficulty understanding it, but your target audiences may be perplexed by how complex the writing is. The number of test readers used can range and play a role in determining the usability of your final draft. The number of test readers used depends on the type of draft and the availability of test subjects. For example, sometimes ten or more test readers are needed in testing the overall comprehension of a draft. The purpose of needing more test readers is that each test reader have a unique perspective, and thus can contribute different opinions and ideas. On the other hand, in case of a more structured drafts such as the step-by-step instructions, fewer testers are needed because all you need from them is for them to test for you the clearly of your instruction. The key here is to make sure that your test readers use your draft the same way your users will.

'''Major categories for readers' tasks'''
Generally speaking, the tasks done by the test readers can be categorized into three categories. 
*Perform a procedure (i.e. performance test), such as going through a step-by-step instruction.
*Locate information (i.e. location test), such as finding information in a Reference Manual.
*Understand and remember content (i.e. understandability test), such as learning something through reading.
In case of testing for a newly designed website, all three categories are needed to ensure accurate results.

==Testing==

There are three main types of usability tests:

'''Performance Test'''

A performance draft is also known as instructions. It is writing in order to help the reader perform an action. The way to test a performance draft is to give the draft to tester in an environment that has the same tools, information, and references as your target audience would have. As they read the instructions, observe them without interference in order to see if they can perform the process as smooth as possible without any complications.

Here are the four major elements of performance tests:
*Tasks: Ask testers to perform the same tasks your readers will perform.
*Location: Use the same setting for testing that your readers would use.
*Resources: Provide testers with the same tools, equipment, and other resources that your readers will have but not additional ones.
*Information Gathering: Gather information in ways that will enable you to observe the details of the testers' experiences without interfering in their testing of your draft.

'''Location Tests'''

Location tests ask readers to locate information in reference manuals or websites. One way to test how valuable the layout of your writing is is to ask the test readers questions and have them locate information in the text as fast as they can. This type of test is very valuable in terms of how good your headings, topic sentences, front matter, back matter, and links are at guiding a reader through the text or website.

'''Understandability Tests'''

Understandability tests are extremely important just for the fact that if your reader does not understand or comprehend what you are communicating then the writing is useless to them. Understandability testing should be utilized in every writing test. The main way to conduct understandability tests is to have the test reader read the information and then answer strategic questions in order to get responses that will help guide your editing process.

*Note: Conducting many small usability test drafts is far more efficient than conducting one large test after the finished draft is complete. If you are testing a web page, sketch the design on paper to be tested so you get a sense of what is needed before starting the website creation. Testing drafts more frequently will allow for many small easier revisions instead of one big overhaul of the draft.

==After Usability Testing==

After the test subject reads and uses your draft, the first step is to interview the person. This is used to gain more crucial information in addition to the information you observed during the testing. The questions vary according to the type of draft and the criterion of the usability test, but here are some general questions that could be asked:

* What was the biggest problem you encountered in the draft?
* What do you suggest?
* What did you like about the draft?
* Was the format user friendly?

After usability testing, the second step would be to analyze the data you collected. A very helpful way to analyze data is to input your raw data into an application such as Microsoft Excel from which graphs and tables can be constructed. From the test and the interview, you should be able to determine specific areas of your draft that need improvement or revamping. Examples could be anything from simply rewording to make more sense or possibly even a complete revamping of your draft. For this reason, usability testing is a great tool for determining the effectiveness of your draft. 

The third step would be to implement the necessary changes to your draft. After the changes are made, further testing is often carried out to see whether or not the changes  worked.''' It is important to realize that your first draft of instructions are usually not perfect and multiple revisions and testings are often necessary.
'''
==How to Make Usability Testing More Effective==
Usability testing can often be a lengthy process. For this reason you want it to be as effective as possible. Listed here are some ideas to make your usability testing more effective.
*Make sure you are prepared to take notes on your testing. Have documents with charts that can be filled with text during the testing process to make data more easy to analyze 
*Ensure testers are part of your target audience. 
**ex. If you have a set of instructions designed for adolescent men, do not perform usability testing on women or men outside the specified age group
*Have all the materials for the tester be within reach, or easily available
*Since you will be testing multiple people on a given day, bring enough testing material so you can perform all the tests you wanted to do
*Be sure be descriptive about what criteria you will be recording. You can make a number system to rank experience or possibly overall clarity of whatever is being tested.
*Also leave room for a short descriptive interview at the end of the usability sheet to get the users thoughts and concerns. This will be valuable when you are revising your document to ensure it is of the highest quality and free of complications.

==Avoiding Bias in the Testing Process==

Avoiding bias is a big thing that can help save a lot of time spent revising. Test readers' responses need to be natural and must be similar to how the target audience would see the draft. Five simple things can minimize biased test results are:

# Downplay the fact that the writing is yours. This will allow the test readers to be more honest because they will not be afraid of offending or criticizing you. Do not show expression when the tester is critiquing the draft because the tester may not be as honest if they see that the work is yours.
# Pay attention to how you phrase questions. Make the questions so the reader has an open path to answer either way. If the format of your questions creates pressure to pick the ideal answer for the test reader, your results could be considered biased.
# Only intervene into the testing phase if it is absolutely necessary. Letting the test reader struggle through issues in the draft himself will allow for pure results that are unbiased. Of course, intervention should be used if the test reader is in danger of injury.
# Make sure the environment is as distraction-free as possible for the test reader. Keep your distance! You do not want to impede in the testing process distracting the subject. 
# Ideally, if possible, watch the test from a video camera, one-way mirror, or afar while somebody else conducts the test. However, if this person conducts the interview also, he probably will not summarize the answers the same way you would.

==Cross Cultural Testing==

If you are going to have your writing read by people around the world or in different cultures, you are going to have some extra issues to consider. This is because every culture has different beliefs and norms. Writing in one culture that is clear and simple can be complex and inappropriate in another culture, unless special measures are taken when conducting usability testing. For example, when Breathe Right(R) nasal strips were going global, their box contained dark coloring because the product was suppose to be used to clear up the nasal passage during the night time. However, this dark package theme did not work well in Europe. They saw it as dark and gloomy and they wanted the package to be light and clear. The key to obtaining global technical communication is to  '''have usability testers from that culture'''. 

==Ethics in Usability Testing==  

Due to the fact that technical communication is lawsuit prone, appropriate measures should be taken even when usability testing is used. Technical writing testing has the same loose guidelines as research in medicine and psychology:

# The volunteer must be informed and fully aware of the process.
# The volunteer must have agreed and given approval to participate in the testing.

For some types of tests, this is only an ethical issue. However, there are situations where there are legal restrictions for the researcher to inform the volunteer of the situation in writing.

      <comment>This attempts to clarify who is external and who is the decision maker in the definition of externality.  It also clarifies that solely considering is insufficient to eliminate the externality, but must be done in a manner that fairly address said party.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Remember, an '''externality''' is a cost or benefit incurred by a party due to the decision or purchase of another, who neither obtains the consent of the said party, nor effectively considers the costs and/or benefits to the said party in the decision.

==Positive and Negative Feedback: A Systems Approach==

=== Equilibrium in a Negative Feedback System ===
[[Image:NegativeFeedback.png|thumb|left|Negative feedback loop]]
[[Image:TransportationSupplyAndDemand.png|thumb|right|Illustration of equilibrium between supply and demand]]

Supply and Demand comprise the economist's view of transportation systems.  They are equilibrium systems.  What does that mean?

Transportation costs both time and money. These costs are represented by a supply curve, which rises with the amount of travel demanded. As described above, demand (e.g. the number of vehicles which want to use the facility) depends on the price, the lower the price, the higher the demand. These two curves intersect at an equilibrium point. In the example figure, they intersect at a toll of $0.50 per km, and flow of 3000 vehicles per hour. Time is usually converted to money (using a Value of Time), to simplify the analysis.

Costs may be ''variable'' and include users' time, out-of-pockets costs (paid on a per trip or per distance basis) like tolls, gasolines, and fares, or ''fixed'' like insurance or buying an automobile, which are only borne once in a while and are largely independent of the cost of an individual trip.


It means the system is subject to a negative feedback process:

An increase in ''A'' begets a decrease in ''B''.  An increase ''B'' begets an increase in ''A''.




=== Disequilibrium ===
[[Image:PositiveFeedbackVirtuous.png|thumb|left|Positive feedback loop (virtuous circle)]]
[[Image:PositiveFeedbackVicious.png|thumb|right|Positive feedback loop (vicious circle)]]

However, many elements of the transportation system do not necessarily generate an equilibrium. Take the case where an increase in ''A'' begets an increase in ''B''.  An increase in ''B'' begets an increase in ''A''. An example where ''A'' an increase in Traffic Demand generates more  Gas Tax Revenue (''B'') more Gas Tax Revenue generates more  Road Building, which in turn increases traffic demand. (This example assumes the gas tax generates more demand from the resultant road building than  costs in sensitivity of demand to the price, i.e. the investment is worthwhile). This is dubbed a positive feedback system, and in some contexts a &quot;Virtuous Circle&quot;, where the &quot;virtue&quot; is a value judgment that depends on your perspective. 

Similarly, one might have a &quot;Vicious Circle&quot; where a decrease in ''A'' begets a decrease in ''B'' and a decrease in ''B'' begets a decrease in ''A''. A classic example of this is where (''A'') is Transit Service and (''B'') is Transit Demand. Again &quot;vicious&quot; is a value judgment. Less service results in fewer transit riders, fewer transit riders cannot make as a great a claim on transportation resources, leading to more service cutbacks. 

These systems of course interact: more road building may attract transit riders to cars, while those additional drivers pay gas taxes and generate more roads. 

One might ask whether positive feedback systems converge or diverge. The answer is &quot;it depends on the system&quot;, and in particular where or when in the system you observe. There might be some point where no matter how many additional roads you built, there would be no more traffic demand, as everyone already consumes as much travel as they want to. We have yet to reach that point for roads, but on the other hand, we have for lots of goods. If you live in most parts of the United States, the price of water at your house probably does not affect how much you drink, and a lower price for tap water would not increase your rate of ingestion. You might use substitutes if their prices were lower (or tap water were costlier), e.g. bottled water. Price might affect other behaviors such as lawn watering and car washing though.

=== Examples of Feedback Systems ===

We explore a few examples related to urban growth, accessibility, electric vehicle adoption, and urban transit.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;

'''Traffic congestion and Travel Demand''' ('''-''')
An example of a negative feedback system is  Traffic Congestion and  Traffic Demand. More congestion limits demand, but more demand creates more congestion. 

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;

'''Bus Bunching''' ('''+''')
An example of a positive feedback system is  [[w:Bus_bunching|Bus bunching]]. Buses operating with high frequency tend to bunch. A lead bus picks up passengers, each passenger makes the bus slower. As the bus approaches the next stop, there are more passengers waiting. The following bus in contrast gets faster as there are fewer and fewer passengers waiting at each stop, since the previous bus is later and gets more boardings. Eventually the buses bunch together. [http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/~daganzo/Simulations/Bus_Bunching.html This simulation] illustrates and explains the phenomenon.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;

'''Agglomeration Economies and City Growth''' ('''+''')
Economists have sought to understand why cities grow and why large cities seem to be at an advantage relative to others.  One explanation that has received much attention emphasizes the role of [[w:Economies of agglomeration|agglomeration economies]] in facilitating and sustaining city growth.  The clustering of firms and workers in cities generates positive externalities by allowing for labor market pooling, input sharing, and [[w:Knowledge spillover|knowledge spillovers]].  (Rosenthal &amp; Strange 2004)
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
'''Accessibility and Land Value''' ('''+''')

Accessibility and land value comprise a positive feedback system. Where land is expensive, it is developed more intensively. Where it is more intensively developed, there are more activities and destinations that can be reached in a given time. Where there are more activities, accessibility is higher. Where accessibility is higher, land is more expensive.

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
[[Image:GasTax.jpg|thumb|Gas tax and electric vehicle usage]]
'''Gas Tax and Electric Vehicle Usage''' ('''+''')
Imagine all gasoline vehicle users pay for all transportation costs. Imagine total expenses are $100,000,000 and the total number of users are 1,000,000, traveling 10,000 miles per year (for a total travel of 10,000,000,000 miles per year, at a cost of $0.01/mile), and all gasoline powered cars get 30 MPG. In that case, if all vehicles are gasoline powered, the gas tax will be $0.30/gallon (or $0.01/mile), in line with current costs. Now imagine, only half of all cars pay the gas tax, the tax jumps to $0.60 to cover costs, still quite tolerable, but as the gas tax rises, the number of gasoline powered cars should be expected to fall. The following image shows the expected gas tax based on the above assumptions with a varying number of gasoline powered cars on the road. Note especially this is a log-log scale. At 50,000 cars with gasoline engines (95% non-gasoline powered), the tax jumps to $6.00 per gallon (above European levels), but the last car has to pay $300,000 per gallon. The move away from the gas tax is a positive feedback system that will accelerate. A replacement may be required.


&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
'''Urban Transit (The &quot;Mohring Effect&quot;) ''' ('''+''')
Fixed-route urban transit networks also have the potential to exhibit characteristics of a positive feedback system through a process known as the [[w:Mohring effect|&quot;Mohring effect&quot;]].  Since the costs facing users of public transit services include elements such as the user's time, which has a fixed component to account for time spent waiting for a bus or train, it can be shown that at higher levels of demand waiting times decrease due to more frequent service.  This, in turn, makes public transit more attractive.  Thus, the setting of marginal cost fares should take into account relevant user time costs in order to achieve optimality.  The Mohring effect may provide an efficiency rationale for the subsidization of some urban transit services.  

The Mohring effect may arise through the provision of more frequent service on a single route, as described above, and also in a network setting.  For example, if the density of routes in a network are increased, the time costs faced by users in accessing the nearest stop will decrease, again reducing the total cost of a trip.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
[[Image:TE-Positive-Mogridge1.png|thumb|left]]
[[Image:TE-Positive-Mogridge2.png|thumb|right]]
'''Mode Choice and the Mogridge hypothesis''' ('''+''')
''(see Mogridge, M.J.H., D.J. Holden, J. Bird and G.C. Terzis, 1987, The Downs/Thomson Paradox and the Transportation Planning Process, ''International Journal of Transport Economics'', 14(3): 283-311.)''


Why did the automobile take-off? Because at all values of auto-mode share, the automobile has a faster travel speed than transit, even though  the city might be better off as a whole (have an overall faster speed) if the congestion from autos was avoided altogether and everyone rode the bus.  Mogridge&lt;ref name=Mogridge1987&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Mogridge | first1=Martin J.H. | last2=Holden | first2=D.J. | last3=Bird | first3=J. | last4=Terzis | first4=G.C. | year=1987 | month=October | title=The Downs/Thomson paradox and the transportation planning process | journal=International Journal of Transport Economics | volume=14 | issue=3 | pages=283-311}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others have hypothesized that this is indeed how congested transportation systems work in the absence of charges for road access.  &lt;ref name=Mogridge1987/&gt;

Is the left figure correct?  Or does the second figure (right) more accurately reflect the empirical evidence?  The best collection of evidence to date has been compiled in a review by Mogridge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Mogridge | first=Martin J.H. | year=1997 | month=January | title=The self-defeating nature of urban road capacity policy:  a review of theories, disputes and available evidence | journal=Transport Policy | volume=4 | issue=1 | pages=5-23 | doi=10.1016/S0967-070X(96)00030-3 | accessdate=07-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

&lt;!-- One example of a negative feedback cycle is the equilibrium between auto and transit mode choice.  Assuming a fixed level of demand, an improvement to a congested road link (providing an increase in the utility of the auto mode) might result in a decrease in the demand for transit, as the auto mode becomes more attractive relative to the transit mode (although reducing travel time might also slightly improve the utility of the transit mode in &lt;i&gt;absolute&lt;/i&gt; terms.  The result would be an equilibrium in which more travelers chose the auto mode and fewer used transit.  This is the outcome predicted by the &lt;i&gt;Mogridge Hypothesis&lt;/i&gt;, as described in a subsequent section.  This dynamic feedback relationship may have important implications for planning, especially if the new equilibrium results in higher social costs (perhaps due to increased congestion in the long run).

&lt;/div&gt;

== Network Externalities ==
The idea underlying [[w:Network effect|network externalities]] is that a network is more valuable the more people (destinations) who are on (served by) it.  

=== Examples of networks ===
Examples of networks from communications include:
*	telegraph, 
*	telephone, 
*	fax, 
*	email, 
*	World Wide Web, 
*	automated teller machines, and 
*	the English language.

In transportation, networks examples include:
*	railroads, 
*	highways, 
*	airports, 
*	shipping containers.  

=== Examples of network externalities ===
Non-transportation  examples of network externalities include 
*	the typewriter keyboard, 
*	electrical sockets, 
*	nuts and bolts, 
*	weights and measures (SI or the metric system)

and anything else that has been standardized.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #02D4EE; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
'''Exercise'''
Identify four technologies (related in some way to transportation) in which network externalities exist (that have inter-organizational standards). […]
&lt;/div&gt;

=== Terms ===
Terms that are often used in describing network externalities: 
*	[[w:Lock-in (decision-making)|Lock-in]]
*	[[w:Path dependence|Path Dependence]]
*	[[w:Critical mass (sociodynamics)|Critical Mass]]
*	[[w:Returns to scale|Increasing Returns]]
*	[[w:Economies of agglomeration|Agglomeration Economies]]
*	[[w:Bandwagon effect|Bandwagon effect]]
*	[[w:Metcalfe's law|&quot;Metcalfe's Law&quot;]]: The value of a network increases with the square of the number of members.

== Agglomeration Economies ==
The idea of agglomeration economies has been long considered in urban economics. Transportation of one form or another drives these agglomeration economies. 


The spatial economics literature observes: Specialized and diversified cities co-exist. Larger cities tend to be more diversified. The distribution of city-sizes and specializations tend to be stable over time. City growth is related to specialization and diversity. Relocations are from diversified to specialized cities. Assumptions include: crowding, agents, labour mobility, (endogenous) self-organisation, path-dependency, systems of cities (policentricity).

The following are some quotes about agglomeration:


* “My purpose is to show that cities are primary economic organs” (Jacobs 1969, p.6).
* “Development is a process of continuously improving in a context that makes injecting improvisations feasible. Cities create that context. Nothing else does” (Jacobs 1984, p.155).
* “The city is not only the place where growth occurs, but also the engine of growth itself” (Duranton 2000, p.291-292).
* “Large cities have been and will continue to be an important source of economic growth” (Quigly 1998, p.137).
* “Agglomeration can be considered the territorial counterpart of economic growth” (Fujita and Thisse 2002, p.389).

Agglomeration, productivity and (urban) scale in a knowledge driven economy

* &quot;City-regions are locomotives of the national economies within which they are situated, in that they are the sites of dense masses of interrelated economic activities that also typically have high levels of productivity by reason of their jointly-generated agglomeration economies and their innovative potentials &quot; Scott and Storper, 2003

* &quot;Metropolitan spaces are becoming, more and more, the adequate ecosystems of advanced technology and economy…. [T]he decrease of communication costs does not by itself lead to a spreading and diffusion of wealth and power; on the contrary, it entails their polarization.&quot; Veltz, 2005

The following table enumerates different types of scale (intra-firm) and agglomeration (inter-firm) scale economies.

== Standardization and Coordination Externalities ==

[[Image:Numpad calc.png|right|thumb|100px|Image of Calculator Keypad: 0, 1, 2, 3 increasing from bottom to top.]]
[[Image:Telephone-keypad.png|right|thumb|100px|Image of Telephone Keypad: 1, 2, 3 increasing from top to bottom, with 0 at bottom.]]

A typical remote control for Cable TV in the first part of the 21st century has up and down arrows to adjust channels. Pushing the up (plus) button will move you away from channel 0, while the down button will move you toward channel 0 (although if you reach the final channel, you will return to home). But remote controls also have a navigation for the onscreen guide - these have an up, down, left, and right arrow. The up arrow moves you through the onscreen guide, but here up move you toward channel 0, while down moves you away from 0. The left and right arrows move you forward or backward through time. 

These remote controls have a further set of controls to operate an auxiliary device like a DVD or an inbuilt device like a personal video recorder. The left arrow, following the convention from tape recorders, plays (forward in time), while the double left arrow (on the right-most side) is fast forward and the double right-pointing arrow (on the left side) moves you in reverse (rewind). Other buttons do other things. 

Complaints about the complexity of modern remote controls are hardly unique&lt;ref&gt;Nielson, J. (2004), ‘Remote Control Anarchy’.&lt;/ref&gt; . Each remote is custom for a particular box, so as people accumulate boxes attached to TVs, the number of remotes increases accordingly. The utopia of the universal remote remains unreached; one hopes the situation will not sustain for another few decades before standardization moves in, or some other interface becomes widespread. 

Like remote controls, keypads are another area where conventions may confuse. 

Keypads on telephones and calculators represent the same ten digits, however they have different layouts. The telephone keypad, introduced with the advent of Touch Tone dialing by the Bell System in the 1960s places ''0'' (or ''O'' for operator, it is not always clear on telephones) at the bottom, and then numbers digits 1 - 9 in three rows of three columns each from the top. A calculator keypad (also used on computer keyboards) on the other hand, while it places 0 at the bottom, numbers 1 to 9 also in three rows of three columns, but in this case beginning at the bottom, as shown in Figure. These conventions have carried over to computers, which could array numbers in any random way, but use the different conventions to represent the different devices. Newer devices, such as television remote controls, could use either, but typically follow the telephone layout (though some have original layouts themselves, e.g. going from 1 to 4 on the first row, 5 to 8 on the second row, and 9 and 0 on the third row).

For operating a television, rarely an urgent activity, the additional cognitive load of a poorly-designed or non-standard interface is annoying, but not dangerous. With the case of election ballots, such confusion and resulting error may change the outcomes (such as the odd butterfly ballot used in West Palm Beach, Florida in the 2000 Presidential election, resulting in a disproportionate (compared to other jurisdictions) number of votes for Pat Buchanan, and likely giving the state of Florida, and thus the United States electoral college and the presidency to George W. Bush).

American travelers trying to write emails in some European countries may note that the standard ''QWERTY keyboard'' found in the English speaking world (so-named for the keys on the top-row of letters) has been replaced by a keyboard, which mainly swaps the Y and Z, but has some minor changes, dubbed the ''QWERTZ kezboard''. This is just enough to throw off touch-tzpists (er, typists). I am sure the confusion is two-way. 

For driving cars in the United States, many functions have been fortunately standardized. The brake foot pedal is on the left, the accelerator on the right. The steering wheel itself usually performs as expected. Less critical functions remain confusing, especially when switching cars, or driving an unfamiliar vehicle, such as a rental car, the difficulty compounds as this is usually done in an unfamiliar place. Where is the windshield wiper? The light switch? The brights? The transmission control? The radio? The environmental controls? The locks? The window controls? The rear-view window control? The unlock for the trunk? The unlock for the gas tank? Where is the gas tank - driver or passenger side? All vary with make, model, and year of vehicle.

[[w:Right-_and_left-hand_traffic|Driving on the left of the right]] is standardized locally, but not globally.  As any traveler from continental Europe, North America, or South America knows, things differ on the islands of Great Britain, New Zealand, Japan, the Caribbean, and even the island-continent of Australia and the Indian subcontinent.

Traffic signals usually report red on top and green on bottom. What does it mean when the light is simultaneously red and green? Or red and yellow (amber), or green and yellow? Or the green light flashes? All of these patterns are local, but not global standards.

== Construction of Revealed Demand (Fulfilled Expectation) Curve with Positive Network Externalities ==
[[Image:TE-Positive-RevealedExternalities.png|thumb|right|500px|Construction of Revealed Demand (Fulfilled Expectation) Curve with Positive Network Externalities]]
''(based on Economides, Nicholas (1996) [http://www.stern.nyu.edu/networks/top.html The Economics of Networks]. ''Journal of Industrial Organization'', Vol. 14, no. 6, pp. 673-699 October 1996)''

A demand curve for a typical good is downward sloping, the more it costs, the less that will be consumed. However, the demand for a network good rises with the number of members of the network (Economides 1996). Each user of the network creates a positive externality for other users. Thus, networks exhibit a seemingly upward sloping demand curve, self-limiting at saturation, with perfectly inelastic demand.



=== Rationale ===
Figure 1 constructs the revealed demand curves for positive network externalities. Let &lt;math&gt;P(n; n_e )&lt;/math&gt; be the willingness to pay for the nth unit of the good when n&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; units are expected to be sold (assume each consumer purchases only one unit of the good). The network is more valuable the more units are sold. With only one consumer, (&lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;), the network is not particularly valuable, so the implicit demand at &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;D_1&lt;/math&gt;) is low, lower than at &lt;math&gt;D_2&lt;/math&gt;, which is lower than &lt;math&gt;D_3&lt;/math&gt;, etc.  Drawing a line between the number of consumers (&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;) and the implicit demand curve at that number (&lt;math&gt;D_n&lt;/math&gt;) traces out an approximately parabolic shape, &lt;math&gt;P(n, n)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Conditions ===
&lt;math&gt;P(n, n)&lt;/math&gt; is the equilibrium price where the demand curve for a network of size &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;D_e&lt;/math&gt;) intersects the vertical projection of the network size when the number of consumers (network size) is &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;P(n, n)&lt;/math&gt; is thus the fulfilled expectations (or revealed demand) curve, the set of prices that the nth consumer would actually pay to join the network which would sustain n-consumers. The fulfilled expectations demand is increasing for small &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; if any one of three conditions hold: 
# “The utility of every consumer in a network of zero size is zero, or  
# there are immediate and large external benefits to network expansion for very small networks, or  
#  there is a significant density of high-willingness-to-pay consumers who are just indifferent on joining a network of approximately zero size.” 

=== Saturation ===
While demand rises with the number of members, thereby exhibiting positive critical mass under perfect competition, there is a saturation point, such that increasing the number of members does not add value.  Such a system exhibits multiple equilibria (the largest of which is stable), and under perfect competition, the amount of network may be under-supplied because the positive externalities cannot be internalized to the producing firms.

=== Intersection with U-shaped cost curves ===
[[File:NetExt-A.png|thumb|left|250px| A - supply intersects demand twice: when cost is decreasing and demand is increasing, and when cost is increasing and demand is decreasing]]
[[File:NetExt-B.png|thumb|right|250px| B  - supply intersects demand twice: when cost is decreasing and demand is decreasing, and when cost is increasing and demand is decreasing]]
[[File:NetExt-C.png|thumb|left|250px| C - supply intersects demand twice: when cost is decreasing and demand is increasing, and when cost is increasing and demand is increasing]]
[[File:NetExt-D.png|thumb|right|250px| D - supply does not intersect demand]]

We might then think about intersecting our parabolic demand curve with our U-shaped supply curve. Ignoring tangencies, four key outcomes are possible, as shown in the figures below. In the three cases (A,B,C) where the curves intersect, the intersection on the right side, denoted Q*, would be a stable equilibrium.  However, to get to the intersection on the right, one might have to pass through the intersection on the left.

=== Analogy between Scale and Scope economies on the cost side ===

In the chapter on costs we noted that there exist scale and scope economies on the cost side. Scale economies indicate it is cheaper to produce a given amount if more units are being produced (as a fixed cost can be spread over more units) and scope economies indicate it is cheaper to produce multiple goods together rather than separately.

On the demand side, we noted above network externalities, which are analogous to scale economies, it is more valuable to consume the more consumers there are. Goods may also be more valued if consumed together rather than separately (e.g. complements) or because variety is preferred to monotony. These ''Variety'' or ''Inter-technology'' externalities are analogous to economies of scope.




== Other Concepts Related to Positive Feedback Systems ==

=== Companion-Innovation ===
''(based on Garrison W, Souleyrette R, (1996), &quot;Transportation, Innovation and Development: The Companion Innovation Hypothesis&quot;, ''Logistics and Transportation Review'', vol. 32, pp. 5-38).''

The economy is a series of [[Transportation Economics/Supply chains|linked markets]]. The &quot;companion innovation&quot; hypothesis  suggests that improvements in transport energize other sectors of the economy.

Does the demand curve include those positive externalities?

How smart are markets?

Does willingness to pay change over time at a rate greater than the discount rate?

[[Image:TE-Positive-Demand.png]]

The reorganization and innovation lead to productivity growth, which should be captured from a macro-economic perspective (see the lecture on transportation and productivity). If positive externalities are not captured (and negative are), there is clearly underinvestment.

=== Learning Curves ===

Average variable costs decline with output and time as processes get more efficient (people get smarter).  Research and Development is a function of market size, which helps explain the process.

[[Image:TE-Positive-AVC.png]]

=== Consumption Economies ===


Average fixed costs decline with market size.

[[Image:TE-Positive-AFC.png]]

In markets with large fixed costs that have cost recovery as an aim (public infrastructure as an example), this can be very important. As the market grows, the cost per user drops.  This of itself should increase demand – and can be seen as a positive consumption scale externality

=== S-Curves and Linked S-Curves ===

[[Image:TE-Positive-SCurve.png|Schematic of Logistic Growth Curve (S-Curve) ]]

[[Image:TE-Positive-Coupling.png|Coupling]]



=== Increasing and Decreasing Returns and Equilibrium ===

''(see Arthur, Brian (1990) ''Increasing Returns and Path Dependence in the Economy.'' The University of Michigan Press.)''

[[Image:TE-Positive-Arthur1.png|Increasing Returns, Decreasing Returns, and Combination, Ref. Arthur (1990) The probability that a ball is red as the number of balls picked increases from 0 to 100.]]

== How Networks Grow ==


To start, a network must have value to some network members at a minimal size (exceeding the cost of joining), or it must be subsidized. Success conditions for a new network suggest 

#	it must either be compatible with existing networks (i.e. not really so new), or 
#	be significantly more valuable to get people to adopt it. 

For instance, the interstate highways were compatible with the existing vehicle highway system, interchanges were built, and the same cars could use both.  Railroads on the other hand were very valuable compared with canals and animal led carts against which they were initially competing, enabling their success despite the incompatibility of the technologies.  In short, if compatibility has costs, it can limit the market because of the extra handling costs, additional waiting time, or an additional layer of processing (such as software) required to decode things. 

Thomas Hughes said &quot;Mature systems suffocate nascent ones&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Thomas Parke  (2004) ''American genesis: a century of invention and technological enthusiasm 1870-1970'' p. 461 &lt;/ref&gt; This means that well-developed technologies occupying a particular niche make it very hard for a new technology to move into that niche, since it does not have all of the compatible infrastructure and correlated compatible technologies.



=== Where Does Intelligence Lie ===
* Smart Networks, Dumb Packets/Vehicles (Railroads, Telephone)
* Smart Packets/Vehicles, Dumb Networks (Roads, Internet)

Important to resolve this in network design

=== Network Design vs. Network Growth ===

Network Design Problem (NDP) tries to determine “optimal” network according to some criteria (Z). - Normative

E.g. Maximize Z, subject to some constraints.

Network Growth Problem tries to predict actual network according to observed or hypothesized behaviors. - Positive

=== Questions ===
* Why do networks expand and contract?
* Do networks self-organize into hierarchies?
* Are roads an emergent property?
* Can investment rules predict location of network expansions and contractions?
* How can this improved knowledge help in planning transportation networks?
* To what extent do changes in travel demand, population, income and demographic drive changes in supply?
* Can we model and predict the spatially specific decisions on infrastructure improvements?


=== Network Growth ===
* Depends on existing and forecast transportation demand
* Depends on existing transportation supply
* Network can be viewed as output of a production function: N = f( D, S)

Over the long term, we expect networks to grow in the fashion of an S-Curve as discussed in the Lesson on [[Transportation Economics/Positive Externalities|Positive Externalities]]



=== How networks change with time ===
* Nodes: Added, Deleted, Expanded, Contracted
* Links: Added, Deleted, Expanded, Contracted
* Flows: Increase, Decrease

=== The Node Formation Problem ===

* Christaller’s Central Place Theory (CPT) sought to answer: How are urban settlements spaced, more specifically, what rules determine the size, number and distribution of towns? Christaller’s model made a number of idealizing assumptions, especially regarding the ubiquity of transport services, in essence, assuming the network problem away. His world was a largely undifferentiated plain (purchasing power was spread equally in all directions), with central places (market towns) that served local needs. The plain was demarcated with a series of hexagons (which approximated circles without gaps or overlaps), the center of which would be a central place.  However some central places were more important than others because those central places had more activities.  Some activities (goods and services) would be located nearer consumers, and have small market areas (for example a convenience store) others would have larger market areas to achieve economies of scale (such as warehouses).

=== Central Place &amp; Network Hierarchy ===
Network Hierarchy is much like Central Places (Downtown Minneapolis, Suburban Activity Centers (e.g. Bloomington, Edina, Eden Prarie), Local Activity Centers (e.g. Dinkytown, Stadium Village, Midway), Neighborhood Centers (4th Avenue &amp; 8th Street SE).  

Central Places occur both within and between cities.
Hierarchy: Minneapolis-St. Paul; Duluth, St. Cloud, Rochester; Morris, Brainerd, Marshall, etc.; International Falls, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Productivity'''
         
== What is Productivity? ==
The question of what is productivity in transportation has several interpretations.  One line of research, beginning with research by Aschauer (1988) &lt;ref&gt;Aschauer, D.A. (1988) &quot;Is Public Expenditure Productive?&quot; Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; and continuing through Boarnet (1998) &lt;ref&gt;Boarnet, M.G. (1998) &quot;Spillovers and the Locational Effects of Public Infrastructure&quot; ''Journal of Regional Science'' 38(3) 381-400.&lt;/ref&gt; and Nadiri (1996) &lt;ref&gt;Nadiri, M.I. and Mamuneas, T.P. (1996) ''Contribution of Highway Capital to Industry and National Productivity Growth'' Federal Highway Administration.   Office of Policy Development.&lt;/ref&gt; examines how transportation investment affects the economy at large.  These papers tend to treat transportation (or highways) as a black box, and make no distinctions between different kinds of transportation investment.  

The input is state or national investment in transportation, and output is gross domestic product.   While this research, which we refer to as '''macroscopic productivity''' provides useful rhetorical tools (transportation investments provides an X% return, compared with Y% for other investments) important for large budget debates, it provides no assistance in actually making management decisions, which requires an understanding of ''' microscopic productivity'''.
 

== Macroscopic Productivity ==

=== Theory ===

&lt;math&gt;GDP = f(K, L, T)&lt;/math&gt;
Where:

*&lt;math&gt;GDP&lt;/math&gt; - Gross Domestic Product
* &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; - Kapital
* &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; - Labor
* &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; - Transportation Investment

=== Evidence ===

Nadiri's research claims that &quot;the average cost elasticity with respect to total highway capital for the U.S. economy during the period 1950- to 1991 is about -0.08.  &quot;  That is, increasing highway investment by 1% will reduce costs by -0.08%.  The average net rate of return from highway capital fell from 54% in the 1960 to 27% in the 1970s to 16% in the 1980s, the last number is close to the private rate of return, indicating a near optimal level of highway investment. Does this indicate declining productivity  or an infrastructure shortfall? Nadiri suggests declining productivity of new investment. Aschauer argues that we are dramatically underinvested.

=== Thought Questions ===

* Which one is right? 
* What do what we know about  S-Curves have to say about this? 


== Microscopic Productivity ==
''(based on Levinson, D. (2003a) [http://nexus.umn.edu/Papers/Perspectives.pdf Perspectives on Efficiency in Transportation]. ''International Journal of Transport Management.'' 1 pp.145-155)

Firms try to maximize profit, society attempts to maximize overall welfare.  In determining whether to build a project, select a policy, implement a system, or provide a service, it is possible to estimate the net present value of the future stream of profit or welfare with a cost/benefit analysis.  However, those estimates depend on assumptions about demand and supply that may or may not pan out.  For instance, the number of customers (passengers or trips, for example) depends on the money and time costs of a service, user preferences, competition or alternatives available, the availability and quality of complementary services, and other quality attributes.  Money and time costs themselves depend in part on demand.  User preferences and attitudes can be shaped for the better or worse depending on the service quality and number of alternatives.  Competitors will emerge to provide services that replace previous needs with new ones, depending on the market strength of existing services.


Imagine a world where the only instrument your doctor had was a thermometer. He could diagnose fever, but not much else. Would you stay with him or change doctors? This is analogous to having only one Measure of Effectiveness (Consumers surplus, Benefit/Cost ratio, Volume/Capacity ratio, etc.) to understand a complex system like transportation.

=== Beyond Benefit/Cost ===

So while a benefit/cost analysis may be necessary to make good decisions, it may not be sufficient to manage a complex system such as a transportation network.   Thus there is a desire to monitor the transportation network on multiple dimensions, to understand how well it is performing (and how thus accurate were previous projections), and to steer future decisions.  These measures can be made at the level of a road segment or a particular transit route, or they can be appraised at the level of the local highway or transit network or technology deployed systemwide, or they can even be assessed statewide or nationally.  

These metrics might assess how efficiently labor or capital is employed and change in the system (to gauge where future labor or capital will be employed). They might consider market share against competitors, the state of complementary services (for instance, access to transit or parking in the case of a transit system) or the satisfaction of customers and vendors (to gauge future market share and the price and quality of inputs).    


=== Gauges ===
All of these gauges are important to monitor, but transportation in the public sector is only at the early stages of implementing such a complete management system.  The most basic efficiency criteria are not routinely collected or analyzed, much less used for decisions or process improvements. While the ultimate objective in the public sector is to improve overall welfare, the difficulty is in its measurement.  Things that are easily measured (flow and speed on isolated links) do not provide an unambiguous indicator of overall welfare.  Better measures require much more complete (and expensive data), or models to estimate them.  These better data include travel surveys, typically undertaken at most once a decade. 

=== Definition ===
Productivity is a measure of output divided by input.  

The larger this ratio, the more productive the system is.   So either increasing output or decreasing input can increase productivity.   This performance measure that can indicate the direction in which welfare is moving.  
All else equal, if productivity is increasing, welfare should be improving.  

=== Example Measures ===
Looking at productivity in other industries may provide some guidance.  Industrial productivity is an output divided by an input, for instance labor productivity would be measured as widgets per hour of labor.  All else equal, a firm that produces more widgets per hour of labor will be more profitable than one which produces less.  In examining a trucking firm, we may look for miles (kilometers) moved per driver-hour, basically a speed measure.  Or we may want to multiply the miles (kilometers) by tons (ton-miles (kilometers)) or value (dollars).   Or we may want a different denominator to get a measure of capital rather than labor productivity (number of vehicles operated).

=== Defining Inputs and Outputs ===

So the key question in measuring productivity are determining the outputs and inputs.  This differs depending on what is examined.  For instance, if we are considering a private bus system, then the cost of highways is paid for in taxes and fees.  However if we are considering highways, we must examine the infrastructure more closely.

==== Inputs ====
Beginning with the inputs, we have, broadly, capital and labor. 

* Labor includes all the workers required to produce a service paid directly by the agency, which produces that service.  So when considering the productivity of transit service, labor inputs are the employees of the transit agency, including bus drivers, mechanics, managers, and accountants among others.  
* Capital includes all the buildings and equipment needed to operate the service (buses, garages, offices, computers, etc).  

While labor may go into each of the capital components, to the agency it is viewed as capital (the labor required to build the bus is considered in the labor productivity of the manufacturer of the bus, but not the operator).   

Labor productivity (&lt;math&gt;P_{L}&lt;/math&gt;) can be measured with hours of labor input (H) and an output measure (O) as:

&lt;math&gt;P_{L} =\frac{O}{H} &lt;/math&gt;

A related measure, unit labor costs (ULC) is calculated using dollars per hour, or labor compensation (C) per unit of output, represented as:

&lt;math&gt;U_{LC} = \frac{(\frac{C}{H})}{(\frac{O}{H})} &lt;/math&gt;

For instance, the annualized labor productivity would measure output over the year divided by total hours worked per year.  The appropriate timespan depends on the case analyzed and the available data.  

Similarly, capital productivity (PK) can be defined as output measure divided by the capital (K) in money terms that is required to produce that output.

&lt;math&gt;P_{K} = \frac{O}{K}	&lt;/math&gt;

Capital is somewhat trickier than labor in that capital is often a stock, while output and labor are flows.  For example, if it costs one million dollars to build a road section with a multi-year life, we can’t measure the productivity of capital as simply annual output divided by that one million dollars.   Rather, that stock needs to be converted to a flow, as if the highway department were renting the road.  This conversion depends on the interest rate and the lifespan of the facility.

Looking at either the productivity of labor or capital to the exclusion of the other is insufficient.  Some investments can improve labor productivity at the expense of capital productivity.  Total factor productivity measures can be used to combine labor and capital productivity.  These require weights for each measure (and any submeasures which comprise a measure) proportional to the share of that measure in total costs.  This issue becomes more complex when examining changes in productivity between time periods, as both inputs and outputs (and thus shares) change.

=== Outputs ===

To this point, we have been intentionally vague as to what is output in our productivity measures. What happens when a particular investment is made in transportation that actually increases overall output?

In freight, output is typically measured by something like ton-miles (kilometers) shipped.  So an improvement which increases the number of ton-miles (kilometers) which can be shipped with the same resources increases productivity.  

These improvements are usually timesavings (cutting distance or increasing travel speed) which enable the same truck to be used on more shipments.  But they may also be the ability to ship more weight per trip or driver (for instance hauling two trailers with one tractor, or the elimination of a weight restriction because of a bridge strengthening). 

==== Paradox  ? ====

It might be noted that a link that shortened the network distance traveled might not increase productivity when output is defined as ton-miles (kilometers) shipped on the network.   Two effects take place.  First, there is a shortening of distance, reducing ton-miles (kilometers).  But there is also a shortened travel time, which may induce more trips (and thus more ton-miles (kilometers)).  This paradox can be obviated by looking at point to point distance rather than network distance as the basis.

A firm relocating to be nearer its suppliers will reduce point-to-point distances. A consequence is that while total travel time may reduce, it may not reduce as fast as distance (i.e. speed may drop). Again productivity (user speed in this case) may drop, though the system is better off. Examining [[w:accessibility|accessibility]] may be useful in this case.

=== Behavioral Shifts ===

In passenger travel, when travel times are reduced, people either travel more (either more trips or longer trips or both) or do something else with the time saved, or some combination of both.  Furthermore, activity patterns may shift so trips can be taken at more convenient times of the day or by more suitable modes.  Over the medium to long term, the locations of those activities may shift as well as individuals change first where they perform non-work, non-home activities such as shopping, and later may switch jobs or move homes.  Trips are not goods in and of themselves, but they indicate the activities at their ends.  So a new link, for instance, may increase or decrease total vehicle miles (kilometers) traveled, or total vehicle minutes of travel, but will surely result in more or different and better activities being pursued.   In general, more activities can be correlated with more trip ends, though trip chaining may complicate this.


=== Transit ===
From the point of view of a transit operator, output can be measured by passenger trips or passenger miles (kilometers) carried.  Which an operator desires depends on its fare structure (flat or distance based).  An operator with a flat fare structure may wish (to maximize revenue, at least in the short run) to have many short trips, while with a distance-based fare structure, the operator is rewarded for longer trips.  Transit operators are in many ways similar to freight haulers in the productivity sense.  

=== Highway ===
A highway, on the other hand, is not so similar.  Especially in the absence of link based road pricing, it is ambiguous as to what a highway operator wants to encourage to maximize overall social welfare.  However, from the point of view of a link, maximizing throughput, person trips using a link or flow past a point, seems a reasonable output measure. All else equal, a link is more productive if it can serve more person trips or do so at a lower cost.  Throughput cannot be maximized if service quality (travel speed) deteriorates as congestion sets in.  Since the link is of a fixed length, for a given link, flow and person miles (kilometers) traveled are equivalent. 

However it is important that the input and output be measured consistently.  It is very hard to determine the labor required for a given link, as many services are provided network wide.  If we want to consider a network, then an output measure of person miles (kilometers) traveled is necessary to allow for aggregation.  An input measure of person hours traveled is useful for private time productivity. .  However one element of labor that is often not considered is the time of the driver and passengers.  This is especially important when we realize that the time costs to drivers and passengers dwarf those of the highway agency

=== Partial Productivity ===

Four basic partial productivity measures can thus be considered for transportation (only the first three are meaningful for transit). 

Productivity of Public Labor (PGL) 
&lt;math&gt;P_{GL} = \frac{T}{H}&lt;/math&gt;

Productivity of Private Labor (PPL)
&lt;math&gt;P_{PL} = \frac{T}{D}&lt;/math&gt;

Productivity of Public Capital (PGK)
&lt;math&gt;P_{GK} = \frac{T}{K}&lt;/math&gt;

Productivity of Private Capital (PPK)
&lt;math&gt;P_{PK} = \frac{T}{V}&lt;/math&gt;


Transportation planning models, such as those used by metropolitan planning organizations and others, provide data that can be used to measure productivity.  In particular, over a given network, person distance traveled, person hours traveled, and dollars spent for vehicle operating costs can be estimated.  Agency labor and capital costs will still need to be collected separately.  But the network data can be aggregated to give us the partial private productivity measures  (&lt;math&gt;P_{PL}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_{PK}&lt;/math&gt;), and with the other agency data, the partial public productivity measures (&lt;math&gt;P_{GL}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_{GK}&lt;/math&gt;).

Productivity of Public Labor (&lt;math&gt;P_{GL}&lt;/math&gt;) 	&lt;math&gt;
P_{GL}  = \frac{{\sum\limits_l {T_l } }}{{\sum\limits_l {H_l } }}
&lt;/math&gt;

Productivity of Private Labor (&lt;math&gt;P_{PL}&lt;/math&gt;) &lt;math&gt;
P_{PL}  = \frac{{\sum\limits_l {T_l } }}{{\sum\limits_l {D_l } }}
&lt;/math&gt;

Productivity of Public Capital (&lt;math&gt;P_{GK}&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;math&gt;
P_{GK}  = \frac{{\sum\limits_l {T_l } }}{{\sum\limits_l {K_l } }}
&lt;/math&gt;

Productivity of Private Capital (&lt;math&gt;P_{PK}&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;math&gt;
P_{PK}  = \frac{{\sum\limits_l {T_l } }}{{\sum\limits_l {V_l } }}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Partial Factor Productivity ===
PFP is defined as total output / factor i. For example, a measure of PFP for labor would be Q/L where Q is total output and L is some measure of labor input such as person-hours or number of workers [note that the former measure is better since the latter assumes an equal number of hours per worker as well as equal quality of worker]. 


Use of PFP
&lt;br&gt;The PFP measure is used quite frequently in business, particularly to measure the productivity or contribution of labor. 
A glance through Annual Reports from any number of industries will yield lots of evidence including those of airlines. 
Airports will, for example, provide measures of labor productivity of # of aircraft movements/employee or # of passengers/employee. 
This, perhaps, provides an excellent example of why the PFP measure is flawed; it fails to take into account other inputs such as capital which are used in the production process.

=== Total Factor Productivity ===

Total Factor Productivity (TFP) was developed to overcome the problems associated with the PFP measure. TFP takes all factor inputs into account in calculating productivity. TFP is defined as the aggregate of output over the aggregate of input. It differs from PFP in two important respects; first, it recognizes that there may be more than one output and, it recognizes all inputs in the production process.

TFP has been defined as:

&lt;math&gt;\ln \left( \frac{TFP_{K}}{TFP_{L}} \right)=\sum\limits_{i}{\left( \frac{R_{ik}+R_{il}}{2} \right)}\ln \left( \frac{Y_{ik}}{Y_{il}} \right)-\sum\limits_{i}{\left( \frac{S_{ik}+S_{il}}{2} \right)}\ln \left( \frac{X_{ik}}{X_{il}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;


where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; are adjacent time periods, the &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;'s are output indices, and the &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;'s are input indices, the &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;'s are output revenue shares, the &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;'s are input cost shares and the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'s denote the individual inputs or outputs. It has been shown that this equation is an exact index number to a homogeneous translog production or transformation function.

==== Panel Data ====
This definition of TFP lacks particular desirable properties if a time-series-cross sectional comparison is to be made. Since many transportation data sets form a panel (combination cross-section &amp; time series) an alternative procedure is proposed. It is constructed in such a way as to make all bilateral comparisons both firm and time invariant. This form of TFP has been the term the &quot;multilateral TFP index&quot; and has been used extensively in both transportation and other industry studies to compare the performance of firms over time and against competitors. Robert Windle dealing with international comparisons of TFP used the following: 

==== Comparing TFP ====

&lt;math&gt;\ln \left( \frac{TFP_{K}}{TFP_{L}} \right)=\sum\limits_{i}{\left( \frac{R_{ik}+\overline{R_{i}}}{2} \right)}\ln \left( \frac{Y_{ik}}{\overline{Y_{i}}} \right)-\sum\limits_{i}{\left( \frac{R_{il}+\overline{R_{i}}}{2} \right)}\ln \left( \frac{Y_{il}}{\overline{Y_{i}}} \right)-\sum\limits_{i}{\left( \frac{S_{ik}+\overline{S_{i}}}{2} \right)}\ln \left( \frac{X_{ik}}{\overline{X_{i}}} \right)-\sum\limits_{i}{\left( \frac{S_{il}+\overline{S_{i}}}{2} \right)}\ln \left( \frac{X_{il}}{\overline{X_{i}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

An important additional issue in TFP analysis is attribution of TFP. One approach has been to decompose TFP into scale effect, pricing effect and pure technological change. These are important because scale effect is due to market opportunities or managerial decisions. Pricing is also a market or managerial decision while the pure technological change effect is exogenous to the firm.  Another way of attributing TFP is to take the calculated TFP index and regress it on a set of variables which describe the characteristics of the firm. An example of this procedure is contained in Gillen, Oum and Tretheway.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Improvisation is a skill that requires the musician to take melodic ideas that they've learned and to then spontaneously and artistically construct the melodic lines in a way the expresses a mood or feeling.  Often, musicians will find a favorite solo from a song to transcribe and then transpose into different keys.  The process of doing this serves to enhance a musician's &quot;melodic vocabulary&quot;.  By learning someone else's solo, such John Coltrane or Michael Brecker, the musician can now dissect the melodic ideas and re-arrange the ideas in a way they can best express themselves.  

When first learning to improvise, most musicians begin with learning both the major and minor pentatonic scales.  Lets begin with the major pentatonic scale.  The C major pentatonic scale, for example, is obtained from playing specific notes from the C major diatonic scale.  Simply remove the 4th and 7th note of any Major diatonic scale and then you have the Major pentatonic scale.

C Major Scale 
C D E F G A B C
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8(1)

C Pentatoic Scale
C D E &lt;s&gt;F&lt;/s&gt; G A &lt;s&gt;B&lt;/s&gt; C
1 2 3 &lt;s&gt;4&lt;/s&gt; 5 6 &lt;s&gt;7&lt;/s&gt; 8(1)

As well, the Minor pentatonic scale is constructed from eliminating notes from the Minor diatonic scale.  For example, the C Minor pentatoic scale is created by removing the 2nd and 6th note of the C Minor diatonic scale

C Minor diatonic scale
C D Eb F G A Bb C
1 2 3  4 5 6 7  8(1)

C Minor pentatonic scale
C &lt;s&gt;D&lt;/s&gt; Eb F G &lt;s&gt;Ab&lt;/s&gt; Bb C
1 &lt;s&gt;2&lt;/s&gt; 3  4 5 &lt;s&gt;6&lt;/s&gt;  7  8(1)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Space weather is a general term that applies to the environmental conditions in space imposed largely by solar activity such as the &quot;wind&quot; of subatomic particles that constantly flows from the Sun. This '''Solar wind''' sometimes rages into a &quot;storm&quot; of charged particles (mostly electrons and protons) that can affect, disturb or even incapacitate satellites in orbit, disrupt communications, and pose radiation danger to unprotected astronauts. 

The best known aspect of space weather is the '''aurora''', commonly known as the &quot;Northern Lights&quot; in the Northern Hemisphere, with the corresponding &quot;Southern Lights&quot; in the Southern Hemisphere. These are formally known as the '''Aurora Borealis''' and '''Aurora Australis''', respectively. they occur when large masses of the charged solar wind particles are attracted to the polar regions by Earth's magnetic field. As they spiral down through the atmosphere, they collide and interact with molecules in the atmosphere, most notably nitrogen and oxygen, which causes the emission of light seen as the aurora. The process is similar to that in an fluorescent light.

During particularly intense solar wind storms, electrical charges can collect on electrical transmission lines on Earth, sometimes causing an overload and blackouts (such as in Quebec in 1989). In addition to affecting the radio characteristics of the upper atmosphere, the solar wind charges also collect on orbiting communications satellites and can disable them unless precautions are taken. It is estimated that a solar storm of the intensity of the one in 1859 were to strike it could cause up to 2 trillion dollars damage.

Potentially more deadly are X and Gamma rays that can harm astronauts on flights well away from Earth, such as to the Moon or Mars. Space Shuttle and International Space Station astronauts are at only moderate danger since the Earth's magnetic field provides some partial protection for astronauts in low-Earth orbits (as both the space shuttle an ISS are).

      <comment>/* Evaluating Revenue Sources */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Revenue and Financing'''

Governments, private firms, and other types of organizations that provide transportation must raise large amounts of revenue in order to pay for the construction, operation, and maintenance of transportation networks.  What types of revenue sources do these organizations have available?  Why are some more frequently used than others?  What criteria should be used to evaluate different revenue sources?  This chapter will examine these issues in more detail.

It will be useful in the discussion that follows to make a distinction between the ''funding'' and ''financing'' of transportation.  These two terms are often used interchangeably in discussions though there are subtle, yet important, differences.  ''Funding'' generally refers to the sources of revenue that are drawn upon to pay for transportation infrastructure and services, whereas ''financing'' tends to deal with the budgetary issues associated with matching revenues and expenditures in the provision of transportation.  Most transportation infrastructure is long-lived, making the use of [[w:Government debt|debt financing]] attractive since it allows for the conversion of one-time, fixed costs into a series of payments over time.

== Revenue Sources ==
Over the course of history, several different types of financing mechanisms have been employed in the provision of transportation infrastructure.  The following is a short, but by no means exhaustive list.

#  Direct User Charges
## Tolls
## User fees (e.g. Gas taxes, Airport facility charges, etc.)
# Land-based Taxes
## Property Taxes
## Assessments on adjacent property
## Value Capture
# General Revenue Sources
## Income taxes
## Statute labor, or the [[w:Corvee|corvee]], working out the road tax (a form of Poll Tax)
## Fines for failure to perform statute labor
## Sales taxes
# Voluntary Revenue Sources
## Donations
## Private subscriptions (stock and bond sales)
## Public lotteries
# Other Revenue Sources
## Public land sales
## Military Funds


Governments have many types of policy instruments at their disposal to finance and build (or encourage the development of) transportation infrastructure.  There are three classes of instruments that governments typically use to accomplish this task.  The first type of instrument is direct [[w:Tax|taxation]] or the imposition of [[w:User charge|user charges]] to finance infrastructure.  The second and third describe, respectively, financial or regulatory incentives toward the provision of infrastructure and alternative ownership arrangements that may facilitate the private provision of infrastructure.

=== Direct User Charges ===

Taxes and tolls have played an important role in the history of transportation network development.  Toll roads and bridges have a long history of use, both in North America and in Europe.

==== Tolls ====
In the 1790s, [[w:Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike|Lancaster Pike]] was the first significant [[w:Toll road|turnpike]] in the US. In 1808, [[w:Albert Gallatin|Albert Gallatin]] posited that it was legitimate for government to finance roads and developed a plan for a national network of road and canal routes linking the states of the early republic.  Only roads with reasonable returns should be built, but effective transportation was seen as vital to the national defense and to national trade.  On the basis of these principles, Congress had previously funded lighthouses, harbors and buoys in coastal states to facilitate trade, and authorized certain road projects, such as the [[w:National Road|National (Cumberland) Road]]&lt;ref name=Baker2002&gt;{{cite journal | last=Baker | first=Pamela L. | title=The Washington National Road Bill and the struggle to adopt a federal system of internal improvement | journal=Journal of the Early Republic | volume=22 | issue=3 | pages=437-464 | year=2002 | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3124811 | accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  While the Cumberland Road Act was passed by Congress in 1806 and approved by Jefferson, authorizing the construction of a road connecting Washington, D.C. and Wheeling, Virginia (now West Virginia) on the Ohio border (thus linking the Ohio and Potomac Rivers), it largely passed because it did not present any conflict between state and federal jurisdiction.  This was because the original compact, which was made with a territory, was an undisputed federal power&lt;ref name=Baker2002/&gt;.  Later road bills which sought to increase the scope of federal activity encountered stronger resistance as they were seen as superseding state's rights.  This resistance was expressed in the debate over legislation authorizing the construction of a 1,500-mile national road linking Buffalo, New York and New Orleans, Louisiana via Washington, D.C. (which was ultimately defeated) and reaffirmed when a successive piece of legislation authorizing federal purchase of stock in a turnpike in Kentucky (the &quot;Maysville Road&quot;) was [[w:Maysville Road veto|vetoed]] by then-president Andrew Jackson shortly thereafter.  These events solidified the notion that transportation infrastructure provision should be left to the states and the private sector until the early 20th century.

While the federal government played a comparatively small role in the development of early road networks, private individuals and associations were instrumental in financing and providing roads throughout the 19th century.  Until the end of the 18th century, many roads in the early U.S. states were built and maintained by towns and counties&lt;ref name=Klein1990&gt;{{cite journal | last=Klein | first=Daniel B. | year=1990 | month=October | title=The voluntary provision of public goods?  The turnpike companies of early America | journal=Economic Inquiry | volume=28 | issue=4 | pages=788-812 | doi=10.1111/j.1465-7295.1990.tb00832.x | accessdate=2010-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Westward expansion and growth within existing urban centers brought pressure for improved trade routes, many of which were financed through the formation of turnpike companies, which collected tolls from road users.  Klein&lt;ref name=Klein1990/&gt; notes that many of the early turnpike companies were either marginally profitable or unprofitable, but nonetheless attracted private investment from many local residents.  He speculates that, in many cases, the purchase of stock in turnpike companies was seen as a form of voluntary contribution toward the provision of a public good, rather than a rational investment decision.  Many residents in smaller towns and cities willingly contributed and encouraged their neighbors to do likewise through the use of [[Transportation Economics/Regulation#Moral suasion|moral suasion]], thus avoiding the [[w:Free rider problem|free rider problem]].

While turnpike companies developed networks consisting of both trunk and branch line service during the period from 1800 to 1830, the emergence of canals and railroads in subsequent decades pushed turnpikes out of the market for much long-distance travel and forced them to reorient themselves toward shorter distance travel, linking smaller towns and cities to major waterways and rail hubs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Baer | first1=Christopher T. | last2=Klein | first2=Daniel B. | last3=Majewski | first3=John | year=1993 | title=From trunk to branch:  toll roads in New York, 1800-1860 | journal=Essays in Economic and Business History | volume=11 | pages=191-209 | url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=484602 | accessdate=2010-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  During the 1840s and early 1850s, there was also a boom in the construction of [[w:Plank road|plank roads]].  Plank roads were financed by residents of declining rural townships, again primarily through private subscriptions to turnpike companies, and were seen as a means of connecting these places to larger markets via canal and rail networks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Majewski | first1=John | last2=Baer | first2=Christopher T. | last3=Klein | first3=Daniel B. | year=1993 | title=Responding to relative decline:  the plank road boom of antebellum New York | journal=Journal of Economic History | volume=53 | pages=106-122 | doi=10.1017/S0022050700012407 | accessdate=2010-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  While plank roads appeared as a less costly alternative to railroads and conventional macadam roads, the wooden planks that were used to construct them wore out after only a few years, prompting expensive reconstruction projects for the turnpike companies who owned them.  Rather than reconstruct the plank roads, many companies simply chose to abandon them or reconstruct them without planking.

The popularity of toll roads began to decline during the 1880s, coinciding with the rise of the [[w:Good Roads Movement|Good Roads Movement]].  The Movement, initially championed by bicyclists, sought to promote improvement of the condition of roads throughout the US.   European countries were often cited as examples by promoters, who saw the construction and maintenance of roads there by national and local governments as a desirable practice to be adopted in the US.  The movement gained in popularity in the following decades, culminating in the passage of the Federal Road Aid Act of 1916, which established a major federal role in the financing of road improvements.

The decline of toll roads in the US was further promoted by the federal government when, during the late 1930s, the Bureau of Public Roads (precursor to the Federal Highway Administration) developed initial plans for the Interstate Highway System.  Based on the findings of a 1939 report entitled ''Toll Roads and Free Roads'' authored by the BPR's Division of Information chief Herbert Fairbank, the decision was made to develop the system as a network of untolled highways.  Despite this decision, some parts of the Interstate system were initially built by states as toll roads and continued to operate as toll facilities, especially in the northeastern US.

In recent years, toll roads have begun to re-emerge as an important source of revenue for transportation networks.  Declines in the cost of toll collection, due to the introduction of [[w:Electronic toll collection|electronic toll collection systems]] have made tolling a more efficient method of revenue collection than the previous generation of manual toll collection systems.  Furthermore, the rapid growth of cities in Sunbelt states like California, Florida and Texas has led to an increase in toll road development to help meet increasing demand for urban travel.  Most of these toll roads have been owned and operated by public or quasi-public organizations, though there are some limited examples of [[Transportation Economics/Ownership#Reluctance|private toll roads]] in the US.

==== Gas Tax ====

The [[w:Federal Aid Road Act of 1916|Federal Aid Road of Act of 1916]] was the first piece of legislation to authorization ongoing federal support for the construction of a network of highways.  The Act responded to issues of growth in automobile ownership and poor road conditions which inhibited the transport of agricultural goods to market, as well as timely delivery of mail to rural areas on [[w:Post roads|post roads]].  Since the improvement of rural road conditions was an important focus of the program, it was initially carried out under the auspices of the Secretary of Agriculture.  The matter of federal jurisdiction over the provision of interstate roads was upheld under the Interstate Commerce Clause of the US Constitution in the case of &lt;i&gt;Wilson v. Shaw&lt;/i&gt; in 1907.  The importance of the 1916 Act stemmed from the fact that it established several important components of the current federal financing system, including formula funding, the state highway organization, and the relative roles of government.

Originally, federal highway aid was paid for out of general tax revenues.  In 1932 the first federal [[w:Fuel taxes in the United States|fuel tax]] was imposed at a rate of one cent per gallon, with the revenues deposited in the General Fund.  States had preceded the federal government in adopting fuel excise taxes, with Oregon imposing the first state-level fuel tax of one cent per gallon in 1919.  Other states quickly followed Oregon's lead, with all 48 states plus the District of Columbia adopting a state-level fuel tax in the following decade.  State and federal fuel taxes formed the foundation of the early highway financing system, and have since remained an important part the system of transportation finance in the US.  In order to fund the construction of the Interstate Highway System, Congress passed the 1956 Highway Revenue Act which established the [[w:Highway Trust Fund|Highway Trust Fund]].  Since 1956, federal fuel taxes have been directed into the Trust Fund and allocated to the states in the form of grants, rather than channeled through the General Fund.  Originally the funds were dedicated to highway construction and maintenance, though more recently there have been some modifications to how the funds are distributed.  The federal fuel tax has been periodically increased&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2008/fe101a.cfm | title=Highway Statistics 2008:  Federal tax rates on motor fuels and lubricating oil | publisher=Federal Highway Administration | date=October 2009 | accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; over time in order to keep up with the growing demand for travel.

Currently, federal fuel taxes are set at 18.4 cents per gallon, with the revenues distributed to three separate accounts.  One account is dedicated to the remediation of leaky underground storage tanks at gas stations and receives 0.1 cent per gallon of the tax.  The Mass Transit Account receives 2.86 cents per gallon from the tax, with the revenues used to provide grants to state and local public transit providers.  The remainder of the revenues flow into the Trust Fund's Highway Account and are distributed to the states as federal highway aid.  In 2008, the federal tax on gasoline raised more than $25 billion in revenue for the Highway Trust Fund.  Taxes on diesel and other special fuels raised an additional $10 billion.  The remaining $3 billion in revenue was collected from various other excise taxes.  States also levy fuel taxes, ranging from a low of eight cents per gallon in Alaska to over 48 cents per gallon in California, with an average of 29 cents per gallon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.api.org/statistics/fueltaxes/ | title=State gasoline tax reports | publisher=American Petroleum Institute | date=April 2010 | accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  While all states levy [[w:Excise|excise taxes]] on motor fuels, 35 of the 50 states also subject the sale of motor fuels to state [[w:Sales tax|sales taxes]], though in some states motor fuels (especially gasoline) that are subject to excise taxes are exempt from sales taxation.

A practice in transportation finance that is relatively unique to the United States is the '''[[w:Hypothecation (taxation)|hypothecation]]''' (or [[w:Earmark (finance)|&quot;earmarking&quot;]]) of revenues from transportation taxes for the provision of transportation.  In the US, revenues from federal taxes on motor fuels are dedicated to the Highway Trust Fund, where they are distributed by formula to states in the form of grants for highways, public transit, and environmental remediation.  Many state and local governments in the US also apply this practice to the taxes they raise to pay for transportation services.  This practice stands in contrast to many European countries, where most transportation spending is financed through general revenues and taxes on motor fuel or vehicle ownership are directed into countries' respective general funds.
&lt;/div&gt;

=== Land-Based Taxes ===
An alternative to levying charges based on the use of transportation networks is to impose charges on the value of land or as a condition of approval to develop land.  Particularly in urban areas, transportation networks provide [[w:Accessibility#Transportation|accessibility]] which is valued by property owners.  Locations with high levels of accessibility, such as [[w:Central business district|central business districts]], tend to command a premium in terms of land value.  Thus, by levying charges based on the value of urban land, governments can &quot;capture&quot; some of the land value that flows from publicly-provided transportation networks.  The set of financing mechanisms that follow this practice are often collectively referred to as [[w:Value capture|value capture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Iacono | first1=Michael J. | last2=Levinson | first2=David M. | last3=Zhao | first3=Zhirong | last4=Lari | first4=Adeel Z. | title=Value Capture for Transportation Finance:  Report to the Minnesota Legislature | year=2009 | month=June | publisher=Center for Transportation Studies (University of Minnesota) | location=Minneapolis, MN | url=http://www.cts.umn.edu/Research/Featured/ValueCapture/index.html | accessdate=2010-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Batt | first=H. William | year=2001 | month=January | title=Value capture as a policy tool in transportation economics:  an exploration in public finance in the tradition of Henry George | journal=American Journal of Economics and Sociology | volume=60 | issue=1 | pages=195-228 | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3487951 | accessdate=2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Value capture mechanisms may be particularly well-suited for use by local governments (cities, counties and some special-purpose districts), since they already make extensive use of land-based taxes for a large share of their revenue.  [[w:Property tax|Property taxes]] may be considered a type of value capture mechanism, since they are able to capture a share of the value of real property related to land.  However, a more pure value capture instrument would be to adopt a [[w:Land value tax|land value tax]], where the base of the tax was entirely dependent upon the value of land, as opposed to both the land and the buildings or other improvements built upon it.  While pure land value taxes are rare (some examples are listed [[w:Land value tax#Existing tax systems|here]], some jurisdictions in the US and elsewhere have adopted a hybrid version of the tax, known as a [[w:Land value tax in the United States#Usage|split-rate property tax]].  Some of the larger cities in the state of Pennsylvania, such as Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, and Scranton, have experimented with a split-rate tax, in which the rate of the tax on land is set higher than on improvements.

Other types of value capture mechanisms include [[w:Special assessment tax#Special Assessment District|special assessment districts]], where a charge is levied on landowners within a specified geographic area near an infrastructure improvement in order to assign a share of the costs of the improvement in proportion to those who benefit.  A related concept is the use of [[w:Tax increment financing|tax increment financing]] (TIF), where a local government issues [[w:Bond (finance)|bonds]] in order to finance a capital improvement, then recovers the cost of the debt over time from the increment in property taxes collected on the value of the improved property.  TIF has historically been used more as a tool to promote redevelopment in economically distressed locations, but could easily be adapted for use in the context of transportation network improvements.

Value capture mechanisms may be particularly well-suited for use by public transit operators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Smith | first1=Jeffery J. | last2=Gihring | first2=Thomas A. | year=2006 | month=July | title=Financing transit systems through value capture:  an annotated bibliography | journal=American Journal of Economics and Sociology | volume=65 | issue=3 | pages=751-786 | doi=10.1111/j.1536-7150.2006.00474.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Since the structure of public transit networks (and particularly rail networks) is such that nodes emerge in high-accessibility locations, serving as focal points for development, the increment in property value generated by the network at or near stations can be used to fund operations and perhaps some portion of capital costs.  Value capture mechanisms designed around transit networks could take the form of joint development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Cervero | first=Robert | year=1994 | title=Rail transit and joint development:  land market impacts in Washington, D.C. | journal=Journal of the American Planning Association | volume=60 | issue=1 | pages=83-94 | url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a787373141&amp;db=all | doi=10.1080/01944369408975554 | accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; at stations, through which a private developer will either share some of the revenues from its operations or contribute toward the cost of a capital improvement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Landis | first1=John | last2=Cervero | first2=Robert | last3=Hall | first3=Peter | year=1991 | title=Transit joint development in the USA:  an inventory and policy assessment | journal=Environment and Planning C:  Government and Policy | volume=9 | issue=4 | pages=431-452 | url=http://envplan.com/abstract.cgi?id=c090431 | doi=10.1068/c090431 | accessdate=2010-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or the sale or lease of [[w:Air rights|air rights]] above them.  Some joint development agreements require developers to pay a connection charge in order to connect their proposed development to a transit station.  Value capture could also take the form of special assessment or &quot;benefit assessment&quot; districts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stopher | first=Peter R. | year=1993 | month=September | title=Financing urban rail projects:  The case of Los Angeles | journal=Transportation | volume=20 | issue=3 | pages=229-250 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/j631vx2469u22645/ | doi=10.1007/BF01098928 | accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; encompassing properties near stations that receive some special benefit.

The historical use of value capture in the United States is quite well documented and can help explain historical development patterns across the country, especially those driven by the development of railroad networks during the 19th century.  The settlement of the American West was facilitated by the development of the [[w:First Transcontinental Railroad|Transcontinental Railroad]], which was aided by the passage of the [[w:Pacific Railway Acts|Pacific Railway Acts]] in the 1860s.  Among other provisions, the laws authorized land grants to be made to the private railroads near stations in unsettled territories.  The development potential of these parcels due to the increased accessibility provided by the extended rail network generated large rents for the railroads.  The checkerboard pattern of development observed across the American West during this period was largely a result of the land grant policy.

==== Development Regulation and Taxes ====
Local governments may also use the land development process as an opportunity to collect revenues in order to pay for transportation networks.  New real estate development typically requires an extension of existing infrastructure networks or improvements in capacity.  As a matter of efficiency and equity, it makes sense to allocate the costs associated with this new development proportionately to those who benefit from it.  Developers are often asked to contribute toward the provision new infrastructure through [[w:Impact fee|impact fees]] or [[w:Exaction|exactions]].  Impact fees are typically structured to recover the costs of off-site infrastructure and are often set by an explicit formula designed to estimate the costs associated with an additional resident, while exactions tend to relate to the provision of on-site infrastructure (abutting streets, etc.) and are more frequently determined through informal negotiations between a developer and the local jurisdiction responsible for development approval.  Exactions can take the form of developer payments to a local government or in-kind contributions.

There are several reasons why local governments might adopt impact fees or other related taxes to recover development-related infrastructure costs.  First, the imposition of impact fees to recover off-site infrastructure costs is technically straight-forward.  Local governments typically set impact fees by allocating a share of the cost of off-site infrastructure to new development and estimating an &quot;average cost&quot; for each unit of new development.  Second, the use of impact fees promotes cost sharing for infrastructure, enabling developers to share costs among several developments and thus realize whatever scale economies may exist.  Third, the use of impact fees helps to minimize the costs developers face during the development process.  It allows them to contribute toward the costs of development-related infrastructure they might not be able to finance on their own, but additionally it lowers development-related risk by providing an explicit process with appropriate prices to help guide developers through the approval process.  Developers understand the conditions under which approval will take place, and can thus plan development schedules accordingly, with less risk of unexpected regulatory delay.  This type of argument echoes the [[w:Transaction cost|transaction cost]] rationale for urban land use planning activities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Buitelaar | first=Edwin | year=2004 | month=December | title=A transaction-cost analysis of the land development process | journal=Urban Studies | volume=41 | issue=13 | pages=2539-2553 | doi=10.1080/0042098042000294556 | accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Impact fees tend to be limited in use to the provision of basic infrastructure and services.  Their scope is limited in practice by the legal underpinnings of their constitutionality.  Legal challenges to the use of impact fees have resulted the establishment of a legal rule-of-thumb that there needs to be a &quot;rational nexus&quot; between the level of the impact fee and the burden of infrastructure cost imposed by new development.  

A variation on the impact fee concept is the formation of &lt;i&gt;development districts&lt;/i&gt;, where developers are given permission to develop upon the condition that they pay into a fund that prospectively covers the cost of all needed infrastructure&lt;ref name=Levinson2005&gt;{{cite journal | last=Levinson | first=David M. | year=2005 | month=September | title=Paying for the fixed costs of roads | journal=Journal of Transport Economics and Policy | volume=39 | issue=3 | pages=279-294 | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20053969 | accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Montgomery County, Maryland is experimenting with the development district concept as part of a revision of its zoning codes.  In an attempt to encourage redevelopment at higher densities, particularly near public transit stations, the county is proposing to set up a development district near the [[w:White Flint (Washington Metro)|White Flint]] metro station.  The district would be partly funded by the county and partly by developers, and would cover the costs of urban services such as roads, sidewalks, and parks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Spivack | first=Miranda S. | title=Montgomery, Md., council approves new zoning rules for White Flint area | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/02/AR2010030201791.html | newspaper=The Washington Post | location=Washington, D.C. | date=2 March 2010 | accessdate=2010-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In the case of Montgomery County, the development district is coupled with the incentive of a &lt;i&gt;density bonus&lt;/i&gt; for developers who agree to build more densely near transit stations or to voluntarily provide other goods, such as low-cost housing.  Both the development district and the density bonus provide incentives to develop more densely than existing zoning regulations allow.  Thus, they may be seen as an example of &lt;i&gt;regulation with loopholes&lt;/i&gt; to promote the provision of infrastructure by developers.  

Developers may also choose to provide certain infrastructure improvements through [[w:Proffer|proffers]], which are essentially voluntary developer contributions toward infrastructure related to a proposed development.  A developer may offer to pay for such improvements (or provide them directly) if he or she believes that the proffer will help the proposed development obtain approval more quickly.  Alternatively, if the infrastructure required to serve a new development is expensive and exceeds the ability of an individual developer to finance it, multiple developers may organize a &quot;road club&quot;, in which the developers cooperatively agree to provide the infrastructure.  Typically, this involves the parties in the road club signing an agreement with the relevant jurisdiction to provide the infrastructure in exchange for collective permission to develop&lt;ref name=Levinson2005/&gt;.

=== General Revenue Sources ===

==== Income Taxes ====
Some jurisdictions use revenues from income taxes to provide transportation services.  For example, New York City's Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA), the city's primary bus and rail transit provider, used more than $1 billion in dedicated state sales taxes to fund its operations in 2008. 

==== Statute Labor ====
Some of these mechanisms, such as statute labor, date back several centuries.  In Medieval Europe, the statute labor/corvee system was commonly employed under [[w:feudalism|feudal]] systems.  Feudal subjects (vassals) working in a particular fiefdom were often compelled to contribute statutory labor each year toward the construction and maintenance of road networks.  The statute labor can be considered as a general revenue source in which the payments are in-kind (a crude form of the [[w:Community Charge|poll tax]]), rather than in the form of money. 

==== Fines for Failure to Perform Statute Labor ====
Those who did not perform the requisite labor were often fined.  Wealthier subjects could and often did pay a tax in lieu of contributing their own labor.

==== Sales Tax ====
Sales taxes are a commonly-used revenue source for transportation, especially at the local level.  They are a particularly important source of revenue for local public transit systems in the US.  California is a state that has extensively used sales taxes for transportation at the county level, as part of an agreement to devolve some authority over the provision of transportation to the counties.  Most counties in California that have adopted sales taxes for transportation have done so through the local option process.

=== Voluntary Revenue Sources ===

==== Donations ====

==== Private Subscriptions ====

Railroads have been financed with revenues from [[w:Private investment capital subscription|private subscriptions]], passenger fares and freight charges (the equivalent of tolls), public lotteries and land sales.   The use of land-based finance mechanisms such as land sales and assessments on private property set an important precedent, as some interest in using these types of charges is returning under the concept of value capture, which will be discussed in a subsequent section.

==== Lotteries ====
In early US history, lotteries were a common means of raising revenues for public and private projects such as roads, bridges, canals, libraries and colleges.  In 1768, George Washington unsuccessfully attempted to use the proceeds from the [[w:Mountain Road Lottery|Mountain Road Lottery]] to build a road through the Allegheny Mountains in Virginia and to built a resort near Hot Springs, Virginia.

=== Incentives to build infrastructure ===
In addition to directly financing and building infrastructure, the public sector can offer incentives to private parties to aid in the provision of infrastructure.  As mentioned previously, governments make extensive use of debt financing to pay for infrastructure.  In order to make their debt more attractive to private investors, governments are able to issue many types of bonds as [[w:Municipal bond#Characteristics of municipal bonds|tax-exempt bonds]], with the income from the bonds being exempt from federal taxation.  This provision raises the after-tax yield of the bonds, making them more attractive to investors.  In 2009, the US federal government enabled the use of [[w:Build America Bonds|Build America Bonds]] by state and local governments as part of the [[w:American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|ARRA (stimulus bill)]].  The bonds are a form of taxable municipal bond that offer a combination of tax credits and federal subsidies for issuers and bondholders.  Their intended purpose is to lower the cost of borrowing for state and local governments so that they can initiate a large number of new construction projects designed to provide a [[w:Fiscal policy|fiscal stimulus]].  

Other types of financing incentives include &lt;i&gt;government-backed bonds&lt;/i&gt;, where a unit of government guarantees the issuance of debt by a private entity, thus making it easier for that entity to obtain financing for a project on reasonable terms.  Some private projects may be financed with [[w:Private Activity Bond|private activity bonds]], especially those where some element of public benefit may be determined.  Private activity bonds that are qualified carry some of the same tax advantages as tax-exempt municipal bonds.

The provision of infrastructure often requires the purchase of land for right-of-way on which to build a facility.  In the process of acquiring land, governments in the United States are enabled to use their powers of [[w:Eminent domain|eminent domain]] when landowners will not willingly sell their land.  Governments in many other countries have similar sets of powers, though they often use different terminology (e.g. &quot;compulsory purchase&quot; in the UK, New Zealand and Ireland).  Eminent domain can serve as a powerful incentive to expedite the process of infrastructure development.  Private toll roads are rare in the US, at least in part due to the difficulty of assembling contiguous parcels in developing areas.  One exception was the [[w:Virginia State Route 267#Dulles Greenway|Dulles Greenway]] in northern Virginia, where local landowners and governments worked cooperatively with the private developers of the road to ensure the preservation of a right-of-way over the course of the route.  In contrast, most publicly-owned highways typically involve the purchase of land for right-of-way well in advance of the full development of land in a particular location.  Governments seeking to accelerate the development of a new road, public or private, can use eminent domain powers to reduce delays in land acquisition.

=== Alternative Private Ownership of Infrastructure ===
In some cases it may desirable for government to encourage the private provision and ownership of infrastructure.  One way to do this is to allow the private development of [[w:Toll road|toll roads]].  Another is to allow for the private ownership and maintenance of local roads in [[w:Private community|private communities]].  Both of these examples are discussed in more detail in the chapter on [[Transportation Economics/Ownership|ownership]] of transportation.

=== Other Revenue Sources ===
* Local Option Gas Tax, (Cooper and DePasquale 1989)
* Toll Roads, (Orange County, CA is building network)

Some other financial tools merit attention, either because they are currently in use in a number of locations or have been extensively studied and may have a larger impact on transportation finance in the future.  One set of revenue sources that has significantly grown in use recently has been the adoption of [[w:Local Option|local option]] taxes.  As applied to transportation, Goldman and Wachs&lt;ref name=Goldman2003&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Goldman | first1=Todd | last2=Wachs | first2=Martin | year=2003 | title=A quiet revolution in transportation finance:  the rise of local option transportation taxes | journal=Transportation Quarterly | volume=57 | issue=1 | pages=19-32 | url=http://www.uctc.net/research/papers/644.pdf | format=pdf | accessdate=2010-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; define local option taxes as &lt;i&gt;&quot;a tax that varies within a state, with revenues controlled at the local or regional level, and earmarked for transportation-related purposes&quot;&lt;/i&gt;.  They identify several types of local option taxes that are applied to transportation including fuel taxes, vehicle licensing and registration taxes, general sales taxes, and income or payroll taxes.  Goldman and Wachs also note the frequent association of the use of local option taxes with the adoption of [[w:Direct democracy|direct democracy]] practices (e.g. initiative and referendum) and express concern over the subjugation of metropolitan transportation planning practices to popular political pressure focused on a limited set of objectives&lt;ref name=Goldman2003/&gt;.

In the longer term, it may be desirable adopt revenue sources that are not reliant on fuel consumption as a tax base, considering the possibility of higher future energy prices and concern over environmental outcomes.  One particular alternative that has received increasing attention and is anticipated to play a larger role in the future of transportation is a tax on [[w:Vehicle miles traveled tax|vehicle miles traveled (VMT)]].  As its name implies, the tax would be assessed at a specific rate and vary with the number of vehicle-miles driven.  VMT taxes are envisioned as serving as a form of direct [[w:Road pricing|road pricing]], with global positioning system (GPS) technology enabling the tracking of distance driven.  Longer-term proposals for the VMT tax would attempt to differentiate the tax rate by the type of road used, by jurisdiction, and perhaps even by time of day, thus allowing for some internalization of congestion costs and making the VMT tax a closer approximation to [[Transportation Economics/Pricing#Marginal Cost Pricing|marginal cost pricing]].  

The widespread adoption of a VMT tax has been limited by some political and practical considerations.  Politically, there has been continued popular suspicion of the VMT tax on the grounds that it raises privacy concerns due to the use of a GPS-based system to track distance traveled.  Proponents have countered this claim by mentioning that information on location does not need to be recorded and transmitted as part of the billing process.  A larger issue that needs to be overcome in the development of a VMT tax, which will be discussed in the next section, is the issue of feasibility.  Specifically, the collection costs for a VMT-based charging system would be high relative to existing revenue sources like motor fuels taxes.  Each vehicle would need to be outfitted with a GPS unit in order to record distance and impose the appropriate charge.  In the US, the vehicle fleet already numbers of in the hundreds of millions, placing the potential cost of this element of the system alone in the tens of billions of dollars.

==== Military Funds ====
The use of military funds to finance road networks was also a common occurrence in earlier civilizations (and remains to some extent today in some countries with more authoritarian regimes).  Since effective road networks were often seen as a key element in the maintenance and expansion of empires (for example, the [[w:Roman Empire|Roman Empire]]), large amounts of resources were often directed toward road provision under the auspices of military spending (see, for example, Berechman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Berechman | first=Joseph | year=2003 | title=Transportation--economic aspects of Roman highway development:  the case of Via Appia | journal=Transportation Research Part A | volume=37 | pages=453-478 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VG7-47YH3T4-1&amp;_user=616288&amp;_coverDate=06%2F30%2F2003&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1294088407&amp;_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&amp;_acct=C000032378&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=616288&amp;md5=9a2986b18122496134c6db5c2e946eee | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Financing Programs ==

The terms financing and funding are sometimes used synonymously; however in much usage, financing differs from funding revenue sources in that it is about finding money up front which will be paid back over time. When you finance a road, you may borrow funds from a source, but these funds must be paid back from a real revenue source (e.g. user fees, tolls, taxes, etc.). Traditionally in the US, municipal bonds have been used to finance infrastructure. In the US [[w:Municipal bond|municipal bonds]] have the advantage of being free of Federal Income Tax. However, that is no advantage to tax exempt organizations such as pensions and foreign governments. The United States Federal Government in recent years has developed a series of other &quot;financing tools&quot; in addition to municipal bonds. Some of these are like municipal bonds, but present a subsidy in lieu of tax exemption (which is an implicit subsidy from the tax code). A few programs a listed below&lt;ref&gt;Orski, Ken, (2010) Innovation NewsBriefs &quot;Transportation Funding in a Changing Political Environment&quot; Vol. 21, No. 22&lt;/ref&gt;:


* [http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ipd/tifia/  Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act] (TIFIA) provides Federal credit assistance in the form of direct loans, loan guarantees, and standby lines of credit to finance surface transportation projects of national and regional significance.  
* [http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ipd/finance/tools_programs/federal_debt_financing/garvees/index.htm  Grant Anticipation Revenue Vehicles] (GARVEEs) are type of anticipation vehicle, which are securities (debt instruments) issued when moneys are anticipated from a specific source to advance the upfront funding of a particular need. In the case of transportation finance the anticipation vehicles' revenue source is expected Federal-aid grants.
* [http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ipd/finance/tools_programs/federal_debt_financing/private_activity_bonds/index.htm  Private Activity Bonds] (PAB) are tax-exempt bonds issued by state and local governments to aid in financing privately funded transportation projects.
* [http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ipd/finance/tools_programs/federal_debt_financing/other_bonding_debt_instruments/build_america.htm Build America Bonds] (BAB) are tax credit bonds introduced as part of the February 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) and are administered by the Treasury Department. A Build America Bond (BAB) is a bond issued prior to January 1, 2011 by a state or local entity for governmental purposes (non-private activity purposes) and for which the issuer elects to have the interest on the bond be taxable in return for a federal interest subsidy. 
* [http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ipd/finance/tools_programs/federal_credit_assistance/sibs/index.htm State Infrastructure Banks] (SIBs) State Infrastructure Banks are revolving infrastructure investment funds for surface transportation that are established and administered by states.

There has also been proposed an ''[[w:National Infrastructure Reinvestment Bank|National Infrastructure Bank]]'', which would lend money to projects (at a subsidized rate). There is some confusion about the proposed program, as some also suggest it give grants (which do not require repayment), which would make it more like a foundation than a ''bank'' which expects return on its investment. Others argue the TIFIA program already does this for transportation.

== Logrolling ==

Logrolling and vote-trading are ubiquitous aspects of public financing of infrastructure in societies governed by majoritarian politics.  They are also essential to understanding how such decisions are made because simple majority decisions say nothing about the intensity of preferences.  Logrolling becomes significant when minority feelings are more intense than the majority's, otherwise the majority prevails anyway.  In situations where a minority group knows that elections will be held repeatedly at regular intervals, they may seek to influence outcomes on a particular issue by &quot;buying&quot; the support of those in the majority who hold weaker preferences, perhaps by offering support on another issue that the majority member(s) favor (a sort of [[w:Quid pro quo|quid pro quo]]).  This type of transaction is considered to have the potential to improve social welfare, since it allows for the development of options that may make both parties, the majority and the minority, better off.  Yet when allowed to proceed too far, they create other inefficiencies -- there is a finance externality.

[[Image:TE-Revenues-Logrolling.png]]

Following Buchanan and Tullock&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Buchanan | first1=James M. | last2=Tullock | first2=Gordon | title=The Calculus of Consent:  Logical Foundations of Constitutional Democracy | publisher=University of Michigan Press | place=Ann Arbor, Michigan | year=1962 | url=http://app.libraryofliberty.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1063&amp;chapter=31564&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, imagine a simple logrolling model where improvements are determined by [[w:Referendum|referenda]].

Imagine ''N'' farmers, each on cul-de-sac like roads A, B, and C, off of a major road.  Then, consider the following two examples:

# Each referendum to repair a single road, paid by all, fails.  Farmers on roads B and C won't vote for A and vice-versa --- the result is illustrative of the outcome of a [[w:Non-cooperative game|non-cooperative game]].
# [[w:Kantianism|Kantian]] road service standards, that is, when in need of repairs, any road below some threshold gets repaired.  In this case, participants may behave cooperatively, though doing so may require a &quot;Constitutional Arrangement&quot;.

Formula are possible in a narrow domain such as road repair, but much harder when comparing between domains (roads vs. education).

Logrolling often takes place in situations where jurisdictions contain multiple interest groups, each with different sets of preferences for public goods.  Consider the following example.

A recent &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt; article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Lauren | last=Etter | title=Roads to ruin:  towns rip up the pavement | url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704913304575370950363737746.html?KEYWORDS=dakota+and+michigan+and+interstate#printMode | location=New York | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date=17 July 2010 | accessdate=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; highlighting the depaving of roads in some rural parts of the US described the case of [[w:Stutsman County, North Dakota|Stutsman County, North Dakota]].  The article focused on a particular stretch of rural highway (part of what was formerly [[w:U.S. Route 10|U.S. Highway 10]]) that was being returned to a gravel surface.  The article notes that the decision to return the road to a gravel surface followed the defeat of a local referendum that, if passed, would have raised a combination of property and sales taxes within the county in order to finance road improvements.  The defeat of the road tax measure (by a margin of 54 to 46 percent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | title=Road tax measure fails in Stutsman County | url=http://www.kxnet.com/getArticle.asp?ArticleId=587010 | newspaper=KXnet.com | location=Bismarck, ND | date=13 June 2010 | agency=Associated Press (via The Jamestown Sun) | accessdate=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) represented the fourth time in 22 years that a property tax increase for road improvements was rejected by the county's voters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Michael | last=Arndt | title=In North Dakota, a rebirth of gravel roads | url=http://www.businessweek.com/print/magazine/content/10_19/b4177016136951.htm | location=New York | newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek | date=29 April 2010 | accessdate=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Notably, there was a sharp urban/rural split in the voting results, with all of the county's rural precincts voting in favor of the measure and all urban precincts (two-thirds of the county's population lives in the city of [[w:Jamestown, North Dakota|Jamestown]] voting against.

The closeness of the results and the geographic disparity in the voting results suggest that this situation might be one where logrolling could produce an increase in social welfare.  The 46 percent of voters who favored the road tax might strongly favor the tax, while some of the 54 percent who were opposed could be convinced to change their vote if offered a better deal, for example, increased spending on parks, police protection, or other urban services.  However, in this case the structure of the decision making process, namely a one-off, single-issue referendum with no guarantee of the issue being raised again in the near future, prevented such vote-trading from taking place.  The result may have been different if the decision were made by a group of county commissioners through informal negotiation during the normal budget-setting process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Sun is composed of a number of zones in which energy is produced or transported to the surface. The nuclear process of fusion occurs in the core, and radiation is transported from there to the surface, undergoing numerous transformations into longer wavelength radiation, ultimately ending up on the surface as mostly visible wavelength light that immediately flies away at the speed of light.

Directly above the Sun's nuclear fires in the core is a large zone called the '''radiative zone''' or '''radiation zone''' in which energy moves primarily in the form of high energy photons. Nearer the surface the photons are largely absorbed by the material in the Sun, heating it up. Energy transport from this point is primarily via convection, or the physical movement of the hotter material upward to areas of lower temperature and pressure, like water boiling in a pot. This is the '''convective zone''' or '''convection zone.'''

At the top of the convection zone is the '''photosphere''', the region at which much of the transported energy converts back into visible light to be radiated into space.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Waterzooi at De Vlaamsche Pot (2175547879).jpg|right|thumb|Waterzooi Dish]]
Waterzooi is a classic stew of Northern Belgian cuisine. Its name is Dutch, meaning &quot;watery mess&quot;. 

The original form is made of fish, either freshwater or sea, though today chicken waterzooi is more common. The stew is made of the fish or chicken, vegetables including carrots, leeks and potatoes, herbs, eggs, cream and butter.

Typically, fish such as eel, pike, carp and bass are used. Other fish such as cod, monkfish, or halibut can be used. 

Both the chicken and fish versions are based on an egg yolk and cream thickened vegetable broth and usually served as a soup with a baguette to sop up the liquid.

Gentse Waterzooi is a specific version of the dish without fish but with chicken.

==Recipe==
===Ingredients===
* 500g fish of choice
* 75g butter (unsalted)
* 500 cl vegetable or fish stock
* 1 leek, cleaned and julienned
* 2 carrots, julienned
* 2 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into 2cm pieces
* bay leaf
* 10 black peppercorns
* 1 egg yolk
* 250cl double cream
* salt

===Procedure===
# Melt butter in large pan over medium heat - add vegetables, bay leaf and peppercorns and sauté.
# Stir in the butter for 5 minutes without allowing the vegetables to brown.
# Add stock and bring to boil.
# Add fish and reduce heat to allow the liquid to simmer, about 10 minutes.
# Remove fish and cut into pieces.
# To the egg yolk add 200 ml of the stock, stirring while adding - add the mixture to the pot, with the cream and bring the mixture back to just below boiling.
# Add fish and test for flavour, adding salt as required. Serve in shallow bowls. Total cooking time, 30 minutes.

This is the best move. The Black bishop covers d5 from e6 and also points at the queenside when White castles there. Black also contemplates using c4 as a piece outpost. Black's position retains maximum flexibility, as in almost all variations Black plays ...Be7, ...Nbd7, ...O-O, ...Rc8, and ...Nb6 in some order.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Molecular Organization ==

=== The Cell and Its Organelles ===
The &lt;b&gt;cell&lt;/b&gt; is the most fundamental unit of living organisms, providing both structure and function.  Different cells may take on different shapes, sizes, and functions, but all have the same fundamental properties.  Within the cell are various &lt;b&gt;organelles&lt;/b&gt;, which give the cell structure and function.  The amounts and types of organelles found vary from cell to cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nelson | first = David L. | year = 2004 | title = Principles of Biochemistry | edition = 4th Ed. | publisher = W. H. Freeman | id = ISBN 0716743396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two major types of cells: prokaryotes and eukaryotes. A prokaryotic cell, such as a bacteria cell, is one which lacks a &quot;true&quot; nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. The genetic information of a prokaryote is localized in the nucleoid region within the cytoplasm. On the other hand, eukaryotic cells store their genetic information in a membrane-enclosed nucleus. The larger of the two types, eukaryotes further differ from prokaryotes in that they contain membranous organelles, such as the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum.

Two common types of eukaryotic cells are animal and plant cells. Plant cells have cell walls, which give them their rigid structure. Unique to plant cells, chloroplasts allows them to photosynthesize. These two structures are not found in animal cells. The absence of a cell wall enables animals cells to adopt a variety of shapes. A lysosome, which contains digestive enzymes, is found exclusively in animal cells. Another difference between animal and plant cells is the size of their vacuoles. Animal cells have several small vacuoles throughout the cytoplasm while plant cells contain just one large central vacuole.

====Cell Size====
The size of a cell is limited by &lt;b&gt;diffusion&lt;/b&gt;.  Though larger cells are able to contain more biochemicals, a smaller size that maximizes the surface area-to-volume ratio is most ideal.  Simple geometry tells us that the area-to-volume ratio is given by 3/r, which is inversely proportional to the radius. Molecules, such as oxygen, that are required by the cell to function need to be able to reach all parts of the cell efficiently.  Thus, a greater diffusion rate is promoted by a smaller cell size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nelson | first = David L. | year = 2004 | title = Principles of Biochemistry | edition = 4th Ed. | publisher = W. H. Freeman | id = ISBN 0716743396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cell Movement====
One of the most traveled cells are blood cells. Red blood cells move passively as the bloodstream carries them. White blood cells protect people from viruses and bacteria so their movement needs to be quick to the site of infection. The feeling of pain is what happens when white blood cells move to the focused site. The white blood cells move like ameobae, where they move by stretching parts of themselves and the entire cell moves towards where said part was stretched. This process is repeated over and over again.  &lt;ref name=&quot;cell&quot;&gt;[http://publications.nigms.nih.gov/insidethecell/chapter3.html Inside the Cell]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cell Theory====
The Cell Theory is that all living things are composed of cells and that all cells originate from pre-existing cells.  Cells are relatively small because it reassures a big surface to volume ratio, which is need to facilitate a fast exchange of material with the extracellular environment.  

=== Supramolecular Complexes ===
&lt;b&gt;Supramolecular complexes&lt;/b&gt; compose the organelles.  These include chromosomes, plasma membrane, and the cell wall.


=== Macromolecules ===
Supramolecular complexes are composed of &lt;b&gt;macromolecules&lt;/b&gt;, such as DNA, protein, and cellulose.  Macromolecules are the rather large in size molecules in chemistry. The weak, non-covalent forces between macromolecules provide stability and structure to the supramolecular complex.  The four major macromolecules are nucleic acids, proteins, sugars, and lipids. Macromolecules needs assistance, such as salts or ions, when dissolving. In the case of proteins, they will denature when the concentration is out of their range of concentration.  Since they are so big, they will also effect the rate of equilibrium when there is a very high concentration of macromolecules.

=== Monomeric Units ===
Macromolecules can be further subdivided into their respective &lt;b&gt;monomeric units&lt;/b&gt;.  DNA is composed of nucleotide units, while protein is composed of amino acids. Carbohydrates are made of sugar subunits, and lipids are made of fatty acid subunits.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Information==

Some enzymes in the body are used to cleave or cut the peptide bonds in the polypeptides that make up proteins. These enzymes mostly operate by hydrolyzing the carboxy-terminal of the targeted amino acids. Specific enzymes target specific amino acids based on their physical or chemical properties such as polarity or hydrophilicity. This ability to shorten the polypeptides helps in sequencing proteins in Edman degradation. Since it is found that after utilizing Edman degradation sixty times the efficiency will decrease by 2%. By cleaving the polypeptides into shorter bonds it allows Edman degradation to keep an efficiency of 100%. 

==Enzymatic Cleavage==
The following are enzymatic cleavages that mainly cleave at the carboxyl side of a residue. The only exception is the carboxypeptidase A by which will cleave at the amino side of a c-terminal amino acid.

|-
! Enzymatic Cleavage
! Cleavage Site
|-
| Trypsin
| Cleavage the peptide bonds at the carboxyl end of lysine and arginine residues. The exception to this is that lysine will not be cleaved if it is followed by a proline because proline transform the amine from primary amine to a secondary amine. Trypsin will only have hydrolysis with primary amines.
|-
| Clostripain
| Cleavage at the carboxyl side of arginine residues
|-
| Chymotrypsin
| Cleavage at the carboxyl side of tyrosine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, leucine, and methionine
|-
| Carboxypeptidase A
| Amino side of C-terminal amino acid EXCEPT for arginine, lysine, and proline
|-
| Staphyloccocal protease
| Cutting at the carboxyl side of aspartate and glutamate residue (for glutamate, certain conditions are applied)
|-
| Thrombin
| The carboxyl side of arginine
|}
==Elastase==

Cleavage at the carboxyl side of alanine and glycine

==Chemical Cleavage==

Some chemicals can be used to detect the presence of certain amino acids in the polypeptide. Some examples are following:

In addition, [[Edman degradation technique]] can be used to determine the amino terminal of the polypeptide. Phenyl isothiocyanate reacts with the uncharged amino group to form phenylthiocarbamoyl derivative. Under mildly acidic condition, the cyclic derivative contained the N-terminal amino acid (phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)-amino acid)was released and therefore the identity was determined through chromatographic procedures. This technique can be used to determine the sequence of a short polypeptide by repeating the same reaction and yielding another PTH-amino acid complex, which can again be identified by chromatography.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Matt, I'm logged in and able to comment [[User:Cpjobling|Cpjobling]] ([[User talk:Cpjobling|talk]]) 09:05, 10 October 2008 (UTC)

In your introduction, you mention other good books on Python: perhaps you should list a few? [[User:Cpjobling|Cpjobling]] ([[User talk:Cpjobling|talk]]) 09:09, 10 October 2008 (UTC)

In your file example isn't the syntax

  f = open('filename','r')
  f.write(&quot;string&quot;)


Hi Chris,

Thanks for your comments. I will add a list of good books at the bottom in the references, and I ight mention them in a later section &quot;Carrying on with Python..&quot; or something similar. What do you think?

I think the syntax is correct. The 'w' is used to tell python to make the file available for writing, so I think it should be like this:

   f = open(&quot;filename&quot;,'w')
   f.write(&quot;string&quot;)

I've just tried it and works fine. One thing I did notice though is that in Windows if you don't use the f.close() command, nothing is saved. This is different in ubuntu where the text is added immediately - when I first wrote this I had done it in ubuntu. I've now added that to the wiki.

Please keep hunting for errors, it's hard to see your own mistake!

Thanks,
Matt



It think it would be useful to include a section on useful modules for doing engineering in Python. The section would be composed of some short descriptions and a link to the module's website. At the very least, the section should cover:
1) Scipy and Numpy, MatlibPlot 
2) Enthought Python distribution as an easy way of getting Scipy etc. Other scientific Python distributions: SAGE (sagemath.org), PythonXY (pythonxy.com)
3) a few of the units packages for Python (not necessarily all):
    * Quantities: http://dale.chess.cornell.edu/chess-wiki/Quantities
    * Magnitude: http://juanreyero.com/magnitude/
    * An efficient scalar package in python: http://russp.us/scalar.htm
          o Units can be switched off easily for speedy computing
          o 2008
    * unum: units in python http://home.scarlet.be/be052320/Unum.html
          o http://sourceforge.net/projects/unum/
          o 2005
    * Caltech's pyre.units http://www.cacr.caltech.edu/projects/pyre/
    * Scientific.Physics.PhysicalQuantity: http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/plone/software/scientificpython/
some other things which the section might cover:&lt;br&gt;
1) FiPy: for solving partial differential equations in Python http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy/&lt;br&gt;
2) OpenOpt: for doing optimization and systems of equations solving and linking solvers up to a common interface with possibility of automatic differentiation http://openopt.org

Others may have other suggestions. I myself am not super experienced with Python, so I will not write this section right now, but I will come back and write it when I have a bit more experience with these packages if no one else does it.  
[[User:Jsalvati|Jsalvati]] ([[User talk:Jsalvati|talk]]) 18:40, 26 October 2008 (UTC)


Also, it might be useful to relax the assumption that the reader does not have an prior programming experience. I think all engineering students get at least one programming class, and I imagine this has been true for some time. This would allow the book to focus on teaching engineers how to solve engineering problems in Python without having to reinvent the wheel. There are many good non-programmer introductions to python which this book could easily link to.

==Nothing New==
Hey guys, I just got finished breaking this book up into smaller pages for convenience, but did not review them or change them in any other way. It seems that some of them are either completely empty or severely lacking in information. They would benefit from some thorough fleshing out. --[[User:Osteveliam|Osteveliam]] 04:24, 3 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

I am editing two books
== [[US_History]]==

from the [[US_History/Contents/Preface]]

&quot;This textbook is based initially on the College Entrance Examination Board test in Advanced Placement United States History. This seems to be the best reference on which to build a textbook, since it is a standard on the subject and covers what most U.S. history students study in high school and college. 

It has been reorganized and re-edited in Nov 2008 to better meet the content and organization that the college board has defined for a course in AP U.S. History.  The content of the book was carefully chosen for NPOV, significance and interest.  We are very interested in the success of the book and any feedback and improvments would be greatly appreciated.

Enjoy!
AP Course Description http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/history_us/topics_1_9.html?ushist&quot;

== [[River_Fishing]] ==

from the [[RiverFishing/Introduction]]

Recreational fishing might be one of the most popular widely intensively studied learning experiences that Americans (and indeed many other nationalities) participate in.  According to the American Sportfishing Association nearly 40 million angler generate 45 billion dollars in sales with perhaps an total contribution of 125 billinod dollars to the US economy.

A definite portion of this is funneled into guides, magazines, and other learning experiences for the many americans that seek improvement in the activity of catching a fish on a hook (angling.)

It is then with pleasure that I begin the process of defining one of my most intensive learning effort.  I look forward to and hope for collaboration from the many Americans whom have superior knowledge in the recreational activity.  

Fishing has so many different forms, waters and specialties.  Many I am unfamiliar with.  I do though have some knowledge and experience angling for many different kinds of fish in Eastern (US) rivers.  Despite the apparent ease of not needing expanisive water craft, or the complexities of fly casting and downrigger trolling; river fishing has its own mystique and difficulty.  I hope to document some of what I have learned.

If there is any urgent needs for this project, it is definitely for experience in larger waters.  Having defined a river, as 'big enough to support a diverse gamefish population', my experiences definitely are with smaller waters than the major rivers of the United States.

I thank you for your curiousity and invite you to ask questions and post comments, questions and content as much as you are able.

== Objectives for Government Intervention ==
There are many different objectives that governments might pursue by way of intervention in private markets.  These objectives fall under a few broad categories that characterize many of the efforts at government regulation.  The following are some of the more commonly observed regulatory objectives.

=== Maximize social welfare ===

Among the most common set of objectives for government regulatory policy is the maximization of social welfare through the remediation of various types of [[w:market failure|market failure]].  For example, agents can gain [[w:market power|market power]] through the creation of monopolies, cartels, or other forms of organization that limit the benefits from competitive markets and trade.  [[w:Natural monopoly|Natural monopolies]] are one such type of market failure that has been prevalent throughout the historical development of transportation networks, often due to the high fixed costs of developing infrastructure.

[[w:Externality|Externalities]] are another common type of market failure that can justify regulatory intervention.  Regulatory efforts toward externalities often focus on negative externalities.  For example, in the context of transportation many modes experience congestion where prices as a means of rationing capacity are absent.  Likewise, the consumption of energy often leads to emission of pollutants which, when unpriced, can lead to undesirable outcomes.  [[Transportation Economics/Positive externalities|Positive types of externalities]] are also possible and can in some situations justify government intervention.  For example, in systems where [[w:Network effects|Network effects]] are present, government may be able to increase social welfare by speeding up the growth of the network so that it serves a large number of users.

Other types of market failure justifications for intervention involve the provision of certain [[w:public good|public goods]] (a classic example being national defense) and the remediation of some types of [[w:information asymmetry|information asymmetry]].

=== Macro-economic objectives ===
A second set of objectives that are pursued primarily by national governments revolve around [[w:macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] performance.  Macroeconomic objectives include efforts to control [[w:inflation|inflation]], for example through the adoption of [[w:monetary policy|monetary policy]].  They also include efforts to counteract the effects of economic cycles, for example by adopting policies to maintain employment during periods of [[w:recession|recession]].  Some governments may also seek to actively control their country's [[w:balance of payments|balance of payments]] through the use of policies aimed at promoting or discouraging exports or imports (e.g. through tariffs and subsidies).

=== Socio-economic objectives ===
Government may also intervene in order to promote a range of socio-economic objectives.  Many of these objectives may be motivated by concerns over fairness, such as efforts to achieve a desired income distribution, or a desire to provide a basic standard of service to all citizens, such as programs that offer mobility to people with mental or physical disabilities.  Other interventions may be designed to promote safety where it is thought that market participants are unable to account for certain types of risk.  An example of this in the United States is the [[w:U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)]], an agency that has the authority to regulate the sale and manufacture of thousands of consumer products.  Still other socio-economic objectives may include things like [[w:industrial policy|industrial policy]], where governments intervene to promote certain sectors of the economy, or even to promote individual industries or firms.

=== Other objectives ===
Apart from the three categories of objectives for intervention listed above, governments may intervene for other reasons broadly related to national interests.  Some interventions are undertaken to promote national unity, such as the construction of the [[w:First Transcontinental Railroad|Transcontinental Railroad]] in the US during the Civil War.  The provision of national defense which, as noted above is an important type of public good, is almost universally seen as grounds for government intervention.  Finally, some interventions are undertaken in order to promote national prestige.  Efforts in many world cities and their respective countries to attract the summer or winter [[w:Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], which may often involve the development of expensive new infrastructure projects, might fall into this category.

== Instruments of Government Intervention ==
Governments have many different instruments of intervention at their disposal in order to pursue the types of objectives outlined in the previous section.  These may range in scope from simple instruments such as exhortation and information provision to actual ownership and operation of enterprises in certain industries.  [[w:Regulation|Regulation]] is among these instruments and will be introduced in the context of some of the more common instruments of intervention.

=== Moral suasion ===

[[Image:Ride with hitler.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Here, government attempts to affect user choice through propaganda.]]

* speeches, conferences, information,
* advisory and consulting bodies,
* studies/research
* reorganizing agencies
Governments and politicians may influence policy outcomes in ways that involve little or no direct expenditure or regulatory action.  The provision of information by itself may sometimes be enough to influence desired outcomes.  Public speeches and [[w:Advice (opinion)|exhortation]] may sometimes be used as a way to influence support for a particular policy.  For example, the US Vice President Joe Biden, a former senator from the state of Delaware, frequently commutes to Washington, D.C. by rail on [[w:Amtrak|Amtrak]], the national passenger rail service.  He often uses public speaking engagements to tout the benefits of Amtrak and to encourage support, both through actual patronage of the system and through support for [http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/03/13/biden.amtrak/index.html additional public spending].

The use of exhortation to influence policy outcomes is one example of a set of policy instruments collectively referred to as &lt;i&gt;moral suasion&lt;/i&gt;.  Moral suasion strategies may rely on a variety of mechanisms in order to enhance policy success, but they tend to have common elements of the use of persuasion (such as appealing to moral authority or community spirit), as opposed to outright coercion, in order to achieve desired outcomes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=&quot;moral suasion&quot; | publisher=Encyclopedia.com | date=2006 | work=A Dictionary of Business and Management | url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O18-moralsuasion.html | accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Several prominent examples of the use moral suasion appeared in the US during World War II.  The US government used several types of propaganda appealing to citizens' sense of patriotism in order to mobilize resources for the war effort.  Posters were issued by the government and distributed throughout the country to promote programs such as the planting of [[w:Victory garden|victory gardens]] and investment in [[w:War bond#United States|war bonds]].  The propaganda poster to the right, promoted the conservation of energy through voluntary carpooling (referred to in the poster as &quot;car-sharing&quot;) during WWII, appealing to citizens with the phrase &lt;i&gt;&quot;When you ride alone, you ride with Hitler!&quot;&lt;/i&gt;. 


In addition to exhortation, several other types of instruments of moral suasion are frequently used.  These include the promotion of research, organization of academic or professional conferences on a given topic, the establishment of advisory and consulting bodies, and the reorganization of existing agencies.  Where regulatory bodies are involved, the threat of regulation (if not actual use) can sometimes be used in order to achieve compliance.  While moral suasion in general does not serve as a good substitute for more direct economic incentives, it can complement other types of policy instruments in order to increase the chances of policy success.  Romans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Romans | first=J.T. | year=1966 | month=December | title=Moral suasion as an instrument of economic policy | journal=The American Economic Review | volume=56 | issue=5 | pages=1220-1226 | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1815305 | accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; identifies two necessary conditions for the success of a moral suasion policy:

# The public must support the government's position
# The populations to be persuaded must be small 

&lt;!-- Green campaigns --&gt;

Recent successful efforts to promote recycling and discourage smoking include large elements of moral suasion.

=== Government expenditures ===
One of the more common methods of government intervention is to provide direct expenditures in order to ensure the production of goods considered socially beneficial.  Government expenditures may be justified on the grounds that they promote the provision of public goods or quasi-private goods that have some public good aspects, such as education.  [[w:Grant (money)|Grants]] and [[w:Subsidy|subsidies]] may be used to encourage the production of a good by public or private sector.  Often these instruments are combined with the direct public provision of facilities.  For example, the US federal government makes grants to state and local governments for the provision of highway and public transit networks, payed for largely with revenues from the [[w:Highway Trust Fund|Highway Trust Fund]].  In most cases, the recipients of these funds are public entities that build and maintain these networks.  A common rationale for the public provision of these networks is that they display characteristics of [[w:Natural monopoly|natural monopolies]].

=== Regulation - economic and other regulation; ===
Governments may also reserve the right to regulate certain activities for economic, social or other purposes.  In the transportation sector, for example, many industries have market structures that inherently limit entry and can lead to [[w:Market concentration|concentration]] or monopoly (e.g. railroads, airlines).  Rather than provide these services directly, many governments have chosen instead to maintain private provision, subject to some form of regulation.  Some examples of these will be provided in the next section.  In the US, the power to regulate transportation derives mostly from the [[w:Commerce Clause|Commerce Clause]] of the US Constitution. 

There are many instruments that governments may use in order to implement and enforce regulation.  Most government regulatory bodies promulgate rules or guidelines in order to set standards of firm behavior in a regulated industry.  Fines and penalties may be used as tools of compliance in order to punish violations of established rules.  In the context of international trade, where [[w:Sovereign state|sovereign]] nations may have no formal legal powers over their trading partners, taxes and [[w:Tariff|tariffs]] may be used in order to influence trade activities.  These instruments may also be used by voluntary associations that govern trade activities, such as the [[w:European Union|European Union]] and the [[w:World Trade Organization|World Trade Organization]].

=== Government ownership and/or control of enterprise ===
Where other forms of regulation are deemed infeasible for dealing with potential market failure problems, governments may simply choose to directly provide a good or service through a public agency or [[w:Government-owned corporation|state-owned enterprise]] (sometimes referred to as a [[w:Crown corporations of Canada|crown corporation]]).  The use of public ownership may allow governments to set more efficient prices in cases where production is subject to strong [[w:Economy of scale|scale economies]], or where regulation of an activity through conventional means is particularly difficult.  Government provision of a good may rely on direct ownership and operation, or may involve some form of [[w:Public-private partnership|private involvement]], perhaps through a lease arrangement with the public owner.  This type of arrangement will be discussed further in the chapter on [[Transportation Economics/Ownership|ownership]].

== Rationales for Economic Regulation ==
Economic regulation is an attempt by government to deliberately alter the allocation of resources and distribution of incomes away from that which would have occurred in the absence of such regulation. It is thus a means by which government can attempt to substitute its judgement of what constitutes a 'proper' allocation of resources and distribution of income for the outcome yielded by the market. Transportation had been a heavily regulated industry in the US until recently.

There are two major opposing theories on why economic regulations exist, consumer protection and industry protection, which are discussed below. Some other rationales for regulation are also described which don't fit neatly into these two categories.

=== Consumer Protection ===
The traditional and ideal view is that regulation is a device for protecting the public against the adverse effects of monopoly. This view, as described by Posner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Posner | first=Richard A. | year=1974 | title=Theories of economic regulation | journal=The Bell Journal of Economics and Management Science | volume=5 | issue=2 | pages=335-358 | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3003113 | accessdate=2010-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, is commonly referred to as the [[w:Public interest theory|public interest theory]] of regulation.  Nominally, the main objective is to maximize social welfare by correcting market failure, which may occur in several forms.

For example, governments may choose to regulate monopolies in order to force them to produce the level of output that maximizes social welfare.  Monopolies may arise for a couple of reasons.  In some cases, an industry might be inherently &quot;monopolistic&quot; due to the existence of economies of scale, limited markets, or requirements for high levels of initial investment, which may deter entrants.  In other cases, industries may exhibit high fixed costs (indvisibilities), [[Transportation Economics/Costs#Jointness and Commonness|common and/or joint]] costs, which make them prone to monopoly.



Another consumer protection rationale for the provision of regulation is the need to correct for [[Transportation Economics/Negative externalities|externalities]].  Where negative externalities like pollution are present and serious enough to merit intervention, governments may intervene to correct these externalities by regulating the [[w:Emissions trading|quantity of pollution]] emitted, or by setting [[w:Ecotax|higher prices]] to induce less production/consumption of the externality.

=== Industry Protection ===
The contrasting and more recent view, that of [[w:Regulatory capture|regulatory capture]], is that regulation is procured by politically effective groups (assumed to be composed of the members of the regulated industry itself), for their own protection.     

The reasoning behind this view is that industry attempts to acquire regulation mainly because regulation will help them generate [[w:economic rent|economic rents]].  Furthermore, producers in an industry are more likely to have an incentive to influence regulatory activities, given their greater financial interest relative to individual consumers.  Thus, producers are far more effective in pressuring government than are general interest consumer groups. Stigler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stigler | first=George J. | year=1971 | title=The theory of economic regulation | journal=The Bell Journal of Economics and Management Science | volume=2 | issue=1 | pages=3-21 | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3003160 | accessdate=2010-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that producers essentially &quot;capture&quot; regulatory agencies, stating that &lt;i&gt;&quot;as a rule, regulation is acquired by the industry and is designed and operated for the industry and not for the &quot;public interest&quot;&lt;/i&gt; (p. 3).  Therefore, regulatory commissions end up &quot;protecting&quot; industry from consumers, conferring benefits on producers that they would not be able to obtain in more competitive markets.  Stigler's ideas were formalized in a later paper by Peltzman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Peltzman | first=Sam | year=1976 | month=August | title=Toward a more general theory of regulation | journal=Journal of Law and Economics | volume=19 | issue=2 | pages=211-240 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Similar arguments have been used by political scientists to describe the relationship between Congress, federal agencies, and interest groups, often under the term [[w:Iron triangle|iron triangle]].  In this case, the relationship is tripartite, disaggregating the role of government into objectives pursued by elected officials and those pursued by agencies responsible for administration and oversight of federal programs.  This framework has been used to analyze the behavior of certain federal agencies, such as the [[w:Iron triangle#Tennessee Valley Authority|Tennessee Valley Authority]], as well as to describe the dynamics of industry-government relationships in the [[w:Military-industrial complex|Military-industrial complex]].

An interesting variation on the regulatory capture framework, commonly referred to as [[w:Bootleggers and Baptists|Bootleggers and Baptists]], has been applied to describe situations in which incumbent firms demand greater regulation, often with lobbying support from groups with conventionally opposing positions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Yandle | first=Bruce | year=1983 | month=May/June | title=Viewpoint:  bootleggers and baptists -- the education of a regulatory economist | journal=Regulation | volume=7 | issue=3 | pages=12-16 | url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv7n3/v7n3-3.pdf | format=pdf | accessdate=2010-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The namesake application of the theory describes the phenomenon, frequently observed in southern states, of alcohol sales being banned on Sundays.  The ban is supported primarily by Baptists and other groups that seek to limit the consumption of alcohol, ostensibly for moral reasons.  The ban also enjoys tacit support from illegal suppliers of alcohol (the &quot;bootleggers&quot;), who benefit from the prohibition in the form of greater market power in the provision of alcoholic beverages on Sundays.  

Outside of this traditional application, the framework has been applied to other areas of regulatory policy, such as certain aspects of environmental regulation.   The framework describes regulators' preference for certain technology-specific mandates (e.g. &quot;scrubbers&quot; for power plant smokestacks in the 1977 Clean Air Act) as a means of reducing pollution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Yandle | first=Bruce | year=1999 | title=Bootleggers and baptists in retrospect | journal=Regulation | volume=22 | issue=3 | url=http://www.id.iit.edu/externalID/documents/bootleggers.pdf | format=pdf | accessdate=2010-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In this case, environmentalists demanding greater regulation to ensure better air quality serve as the Baptists, while the equipment suppliers who manufacture the scrubbers serve as the bootleggers and lobby for specific provisions requiring the use of scrubbers.  

A common feature of firm behavior in this framework is the use of regulation to obtain market power, often through entry restrictions.  In the clean air example, plants that must comply with the regulation often have incentive to support it after it has been implemented.  Compliance in this case involves one-off expenditures on the procurement of the pollution control equipment.  The equipment might be expensive, but becomes a [[w:Sunk costs|sunk cost]] after implementation.  The requirements for this expensive, new equipment become a barrier to entry for prospective firms looking to enter the market.  The incumbent firms also tend to operate at higher levels of output, thus enabling them to spread the costs of the pollution control equipment across a greater number of consumers, lowering average costs.

=== Infant Industry ===
Economic regulation has also historically been employed in some cases where a government sought to promote the growth of an [[w:Infant industry argument|infant industry]].  The infant industry argument for regulation is typically invoked in cases where a nation sees the existence of potentially large external benefits from the growth of an industry, or the potential for other important non-economic benefits.  A classical example of the promotion of an infant industry is the US federal government's promotion of the growth of air travel on the grounds that it would provide a faster, cheaper and more effective means of delivering [[w:Airmails of the United States|air mail]].  While air mail was initially provided by the US government between 1911 and 1918, the 1926 Kelly Act contained provisions that required the US Post Office Department to contract with commercial air carriers for the delivery of air mail on intercity routes.  These contracts were an important source of revenue for the nascent airline industry.  

The mail contracts may be considered a form of implicit subsidy to the early airline industry.  In addition to subsidization, other instruments that may be used by government to promote infant industries include regulations on entry (entry barriers) or regulations mandating the supply of a specific quantity of a good.

=== Cut-throat Competition ===
Governments have sometimes intervened in markets in order to prevent what is know as destructive or [[w:Cut-throat competition|cut-throat]] competition.  Cut-throat competition is one example of [[w:Anti-competitive practices|anti-competitive]] business practices, that is, practices that reduce or prevent competition in a market, and is characterized by competitive situations where prices do not cover production costs over extended periods.  Several types of outcomes may emerge from such competitive environments which could provide a theoretical justification for some form of regulatory intervention:
 
* instability in supply prices -- governments may regulate to smooth out output prices
* uneconomic rate levels;
* [[w:Predatory pricing|predatory pricing]], where firms set artificially low prices in order to deter competition from potential market entrants, or to drive existing competitors out of business.
* immature pricing behavior -- [[w:Oligopoly|oligopolists]] may overreact to a competitive event, as when airlines engage in [[w:Price war|price wars]]
* high fixed cost with slow adjustment - short run pricing falls below average total costs, especially in recession when there are a lot of excess capacity

When dealing with instability in supply prices in certain industries, as for example with electric power, regulation is used to smooth output prices.  In other cases, as with road networks, the infrastructure tends more often to be publicly owned.  In the case of road networks, especially in urban areas, congestion can create instability in supply prices, since the &quot;supply&quot; function for a road link is a [[Transportation Economics/Pricing#Theory|function of traffic volumes]].  To achieve efficiency in this case, governments (or even private owners) can set prices equal to marginal cost in order to eliminate the congestion externality and smooth output prices.  

Uneconomic rate levels can arise (at least in the short run) through anti-competitive practices, though in practice it has more commonly been the result of regulatory rate-setting practices that have been ameliorated through regulatory reforms.  For example, many streetcar and subway networks in the US were formerly privately owned, though as participants in local franchise agreements with local governments they were subject to several forms of regulation, including price regulation.  Limits on the rail operators' ability to increase revenues through fare increases, which were politically unpopular, were a contributing factor toward the [[w:Great American streetcar scandal#Background|decline]] of many urban rail systems.  The inability to raise revenues through fares frequently led to deferred maintenance of the capital stock of these systems, which in turn led to declining service quality and lower ridership, an example of a [[Transportation Economics/Positive externalities#Positive and Negative Feedback:  A Systems Approach|vicious circle]].

Predatory pricing is most common in markets characterized by few firms, intense competition and low profit margins.  Deregulated local bus services in many British cities have seen instances of predatory behavior, such as the [[w:Darlington Bus War|Darlington Bus War]] which took place in the English town of Darlington following the deregulation of local bus service in the mid-1980s.  The fact that local bus services in many British cities continue to be supplied by a single, incumbent firm in spite of some limited competition from new market entrants has led some observers to suggest that urban bus services may be natural monopolies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Evans |first=Andrew W. |year=1991 |title=Are urban bus services natural monopolies? |journal=Transportation |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=131-150 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/t61x51467t1468x5/ |accessdate=2010-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Immature pricing behavior has been observed to some extent in the deregulated US airline industry.  The entry of new carriers on an airline route, in addition to multimarket contact between carriers, frequently leads to price wars.  Price wars may dampen carrier profits and increase their volatility, but they also confer significant benefits on consumers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morrison |first=Steven A. |coauthors=Clifford Winston |year=1996 |title=Causes and consequences of airline fare wars |journal=Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Microeconomics |volume=1996 |pages=85-123 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2534747 |accessdate=2010-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Some industries with high fixed costs may adopt uneconomic pricing levels, at least in the short run, in situations where there is significant excess capacity (perhaps due to recession) and the process for adjusting capacity is slow or difficult.  In this case, firms may price output to cover variable costs, but not average total costs.  Private toll roads, especially those built at the fringe of developing urban areas, tend to have traffic levels that are sensitive to economic growth rates.  Recessions can cause declines in demand that sharply lower revenues.  Owners may respond by lowering toll rates to encourage traffic, since in this case significant excess capacity may exist.  The revised toll rates may cover the variable costs of operating and maintaining the road, but may not contribute to recovering its fixed costs.  Airlines may be vulnerable to similar types of conditions.  Demand for air travel is known to be income-elastic and airlines must often place orders for new aircraft several years in advance.  This combination of volatile demand and slow supply-side adjustment often leads to excess capacity during recessions.  Airlines tend to respond by lowering fares in order to fill available capacity, even if the fares fall below average total cost.

== Tools of Economic Regulation in Transport ==

The regulatory agencies are granted a broad power to regulate the following aspects of the industry:

* price regulation - maximum rate, minimum rate, rate structure
* rate-of-return regulation
* condition-of-service regulation
* entry and exit regulation
* antitrust (anti-combines) regulation including mergers and acquisition
* regulation on financial arrangements and accounting practices

Regulators may also establish safety standards, which are not discussed here.

=== Price Regulation ===

Price regulation involves the setting of limits (maximum or minimum) on the prices firms may charge for their product.  In cases where prices are regulated to limit the potential abuses of monopoly suppliers, regulators may impose [[w:Price-cap regulation|price-cap regulations]] or alternatively [[w:Revenue-cap regulation|revenue-cap regulations]].  Price-cap regulations typically limit price increases to changes in economy-wide price indices (such as the [[w:Consumer price index|consumer price index]]).  This approach has the advantage of controlling unreasonable price increases, while retaining incentives for producers to increase profits by reducing their costs.  Price regulations may also be employed to set minimum rates in cases where cut-throat competition drives prices below marginal costs for extended periods of time.  Minimum rate regulations, for example, could prevent the exercise of predatory pricing in industries with few competitors.

Prior to deregulation, carriers applied to regulators for any rate change; the regulatory agency could approve, deny or vary the changes. However, generally no inflation adjustments were built into rates, and the burden was on the carrier to prove need for changes. Unjust and unreasonable rates were not allowed; e.g. youth fares could be judged as justly high, while monopoly or predatory prices could be judged as being unreasonably high or low. 

Since deregulation, carriers simply file proposed fare changes, and make fares available for customers to look at. Regulator can disapprove or vary changes in 'basic fare level' upon complaints, but this rarely happens. 

=== Rate of Return Regulation ===

Under [[w:Rate-of-return regulation|rate-of-return]] regulation, regulatory authorities explicitly or implicitly use rate-based regulation for the carrier when they examine proposals for fare change.  If the carrier made more than fair returns, fare change proposal may not get approved. 

=== Condition of Service Regulation ===
Airline regulation in pre-deregulation Canada included condition-of-service regulation, which affected: 
* capacity offered
* type of aircraft used 
* frequency of service
* stopover condition; (e.g., PWA had to stop between Calgary and Toronto)

=== Entry and Exit  Regulation ===

Regulation of entry and exit was commonplace prior to deregulation. Entry both into the industry, and onto specific routes was regulated (as was exit).

Prior to deregulation, entry of a new firm into the industry required a certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (PCN), where burden of proof (of need for new services) was on applicant. After deregulation, new entrants needed to demonstrate they are &quot;Fit, Willing and Able&quot;, and no longer need to show need for new service. Nevertheless, the [[w:Common carrier|common carrier obligation]] remains, and new carriers  must serve all requests from public.

Entry onto routes prior to deregulation was also quite cumbersome. A route license was required for airlines and truckers. That license may have restricted carriers to certain commodities or classes of service. Since deregulation, entry onto routes was much more open.

Exit was also regulated. Prior to deregulation, it  was almost impossible to abandon uneconomic routes or branchlines; therefore, carriers were required to cross-subsidize between profitable and unprofitable routes. Since deregulation, carriers can apply to the regulatory agency to abandon branchlines or exit from a route. In aviation this is straight-forward, in rail it tends to be somewhat more cumbersome. The regulatory agency either approves abandonment or gives direct subsidy to maintain uneconomic services. Usually abandonment or exit requires advance notice.

== Regulation by Mode ==
=== Railway Regulation ===
Regulation of US railroads was initiated 1887 with the passage of the [[w:Interstate Commerce Act of 1887|Interstate Commerce Act]].  The law was designed to curb the monopoly power that railroads enjoyed in many markets, with the objective of protecting shippers from paying monopoly rents.  The law created a new federal regulatory agency, the [[w:Interstate Commerce Commission|Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC)]], which had jurisdiction over commerce taking place across state lines.  Importantly, intrastate commerce issues were largely left to the states.  

The Interstate Commerce Act was motivated by political pressure from the railroads' customers (primarily Western farmers) to regulate alleged monopoly abuses and collusion among several of the country's large railroads.   Railroads often faced limited and inferior competition along routes and had characteristically high fixed costs, which limited the possibility of multiple railroads competing for traffic along the same route . Due to limited competition and availability of substitutes, demand for the railroads' services was price inelastic and the railroads responded by using [[w:Price discrimination|price discrimination]] at stations which only they served&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hilton | first=George W. | year=1966 | month=October | title=The consistency of the Interstate Commerce Act | journal=Journal of Law and Economics | volume=9 | pages=87-113 | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/724995 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Act gave the ICC the power to set maximum rates for the railroads, while the subsequent [[w:Elkins Act|Elkins Act]] required railroads to publish their rates, a provision designed to prevent them from price discriminating against similar groups of customers.  Later amendments to the Act allowed for &lt;i&gt;minimum&lt;/i&gt;, in addition to maximum, rate regulation.  This provision reflected the suspicion of some ICC members that short-run marginal costs seemed too low relative to &quot;full costs&quot;.  The original Act had contained language that banned charging more for a shorter haul than a longer one.  Later microeconomic research would demonstrate that the costing and rate-setting procedures of the ICC were fundamentally flawed.  They reflected a misunderstanding of the relationship between costs and various types of outputs, a mistake that eventually led to uneconomic rate setting and imperiled the financial health of the industry until its deregulation in the late 1970s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Braeutigam | first1=Ronald R. | last2=Gomez-Ibanez | first2=Jose A. (ed.)| last3=Tye | first3=William B. (ed.) | last4=Winston | first4=Clifford (ed.) | title=Essays in Transportation Economics and Policy:  A Handbook in Honor of John R. Meyer | publisher=Brookings Institution Press | year=1999 | pages=57-97 | chapter=Chapter 3:  Learning about transport costs}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Act also contained provisions requiring the railroads to provide services to uneconomic points, a requirement that eventually led to the practice of [[w:Cross subsidization|cross-subsidization]] of services.

railway monopoly in many markets: user protection
need to provide services to uneconomic points: cross-subsidy
some destructive competition; anti-trust need

=== Trucking Regulation ===
Started regulation in 1930s.
began to question the efficacy of competition as a regulator of business;
a strong push for &quot;codes of fair competition&quot; in society as a whole;
start to regulate trucking although it was a competitive industry.

The [[w:Motor Carrier Act of 1980|Motor Carrier Act (MCA) of 1980]] largely deregulated the interstate trucking industry in the US, reducing or eliminating most price and entry controls imposed by the federal government.  Interestingly, while most federal regulatory efforts were abandoned relating to interstate trucking, states retained considerable regulatory power over the activities of &lt;i&gt;intrastate&lt;/i&gt; truckers.  Teske et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Teske | first1=Paul | last2=Best | first2=Samuel | last3=Mintrom | first3=Michael | year=1994 | title=The economic theory of regulation and trucking deregulation:  shifting to the state level | journal=Public Choice | volume=79 | pages=247-256 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x464225r13663224/ | accessdate=2010-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that truckers turned their attention to the state level following the Motor Carrier Act, and were able to effectively capture state regulators and extract monopoly rents in what would otherwise be a competitive industry.  They show that in the decade following the MCA, only eight of the 50 states had adopted legislation to loosen regulations that existed prior to 1980.  Further, they argue that state-level trucking regulation is consistent with theories that emphasize regulation as serving to protect industry interests.

=== Airline Regulation ===
Started regulation in late 1930s.
to help create national network 
subsidization of the infant industry	
protection from competitive entry to effect cross-subsidization (taxation by regulation - regulatory inspired cross-subsidization).

Economic regulation of airlines in the United States began in earnest in the 1930s with the passage of the [[w:United States government role in civil aviation#Civil Aeronautics Authority|Civil Aeronautics Act (CAA)]] of 1938.  The CAA was the result of lobbying by the airlines to protect themselves from what they considered to be &quot;excessive&quot; competition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Morrison | first1=Steven A. | last2=Winston | first2=Clifford | year=1989 | title=Airline deregulation and public policy | journal=Science | volume=245 | issue=4919 | pages=707-711 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/245/4919/707 | doi=10.1126/science.245.4919.707 | accessdate=2010-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The CAA created a new regulatory agency, the Civil Aeronautics Authority, which was subsequently split into two separate agencies, the Civil Aeronautics Administration and the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), in 1940 by President Roosevelt.  The former had responsibility for air traffic control, safety programs, and airway development, while the latter was responsible for safety rulemaking, accident investigation and various types of economic regulation.  The CAB carried out most of the regulatory activities of the CAA, which included regulating airline fares, as well as entry into and exit from airline markets.

Entry into airline markets was limited by the CAB.  It required carriers to obtain a &quot;certificate of public convenience and necessity&quot; (issued by the CAB) as a condition of entry in order to serve a particular route.  Entry into major existing routes was difficult, as incumbent carriers often objected and appealed to the CAB.  Thus, the CAB never admitted new entrants on routes that already had two or more carriers.  Withdrawal of services (exit) from a route also required CAB approval.  If a carrier went bankrupt, the CAB would typically arrange a [[w:Mergers and acquisitions|merger]] which allowed the failing carrier to be acquired by a larger, healthier carrier (and giving the latter greater route authority in the process).

Although the CAB did not set fares directly, it did have approval power over fares filed by carriers.  Since fares were set in terms of industry-wide rather than route-specific costs, the result was often fares that were much higher than costs on many routes.  Airlines were not permitted to engage in price competition on routes, leading them to instead engage in intense, quality of service-based competition.  The primary means for this was increases in the frequency of flights, particularly on long-distance routes.  While this type of competition may have improved service quality, it also led to lower average load factors as airlines operated planes at loads substantially below capacity.

== Effects of Economic Regulation  ==

There are numerous effects of economic regulation. 

Entry regulation relieves competitive pressure. Entry regulation induces x-inefficiency in the industry - gold plating, feather-bedding, etc.  It was found there was a 16% cost increase due to this and crown ownership of carriers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gillen | first=David W. | coauthors=Tae H. Oum, Michael W. Tretheway | year=1990 | month=January | title=Airline cost structure and policy implications:  a multi-product approach for Canadian airlines | journal=Journal of Transport Economics and Policy | volume=24 | issue=1 | pages=9-34 | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20052902 | accessdate=2010-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Entry regulation transfers economic rents to organized input suppliers; e.g., labor unions, aircraft manufacturers, and thereby dissipates economic rents the industry hopes to gain. Services are unresponsive to customer needs, and there are allocative inefficiencies.

Price regulations leads to excessive quality competition, see e.g., Douglas and Miller's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Miller | first=George W. | coauthors=James C. Miller III | title=Economic Regulation of Domestic Air Transport:  Theory and Policy | publisher=Brookings Institution | year=1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; work on airline quality competition. The system is much less flexible and far more inefficient.

Exit regulation leads to cross-subsidization from profitable to unprofitable routes. Society as a whole loses as the total welfare under cross-subsidization is lower than with direct subsidy where funds come either from government general or through air transport tax.

Rate-of-return regulations are sometimes used as a constraint to guide decisions by rate-makers concerning raising or lowering prices.  That is the regulatory authority allows a fair rate of return on the value of the assets (&quot;rate base&quot;) required to produce the services. This gives incentives for the firm to increase its &quot;rate base&quot; by investing more on capital input relative to labour input;  In other words, the firm under rate-of-return constraint has relatively more capital vis-a-vis labor than is required to produce any given output. This is an important source of allocative inefficiency caused by the regulation. Over-capitalization, the ([[w:Averch–Johnson effect|Averch–Johnson effect]])  is the tendency of companies to engage in excessive amounts of capital accumulation in order to expand the volume of their profits. If companies profits to capital ratio is regulated at a certain percentage then there is a strong incentive for companies to over-invest in order to increase profits overall.

Regulatory administration is not itself free, and this high cost needs to be considered in any analysis of welfare gains and loses from regulation. Further, regulation reduces dynamism in the industry, there are fewer innovations, which are difficult to capture in static economic analyses, yet need to be considered.

Making travel by one mode more expensive leads to a  misallocation of traffic across modes, as other modes carry more traffic than a welfare analysis would suggest is optimal. These additional costs also may cause distortions elsewhere in the economy.

Note that if market failure does not exist, there is no economic need for any economic regulation.  Numerous studies have investigated the effect of regulation on the airlines, highway trucking, intercity bus, and taxicab industries.  In all four cases there is an ample body of empirical evidence which suggests that in the absence of regulation the market mechanism would yield an output close to a competitive equilibrium.  For these industries, economic regulation has become a prime cause of market failure, far from being a remedy for market failure. Therefore, the impact of regulation on price and quantities traded in these industries can be assessed by using a competitive solution as the appropriate benchmark.

== Effects of Economic Deregulation ==
Early economic criticisms of regulation emerged in the 1940s and 1950s; and a growing number of academic researchers criticized regulation during the 1960s. These critiques plus empirical measures of the economic cost of regulation in 1970s led to political support, and ultimately, deregulation became the default policy. Deregulation of airlines began in 1978 and railroads and trucking in 1980. The 1970s and 1980s saw a wave of [[w:deregulation|deregulation]] across many other sectors of the US economy, in addition to substantial regulatory reforms in the transportation . 

There are a couple of important points to note regarding the regulatory reforms of the 1970s and 1980s.  First, most of the regulatory reforms that were undertaken addressed &lt;i&gt;economic regulation&lt;/i&gt;, that is, regulation that directs or constrains the behavior of firms in terms of pricing, entry and exit decisions.  They did not address other types of regulation such as safety, environmental, and antitrust regulation, which continued to be enforced in their previous forms and in many cases increased.  Second, most of the regulatory reforms represented only &lt;i&gt;partial&lt;/i&gt; deregulation of industries.  For example, in the transportation sector prices, entry, and exit were mostly deregulated in the airline and interstate trucking industries by the early 1980s, while the ICC retained some control over railroad rate regulation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Winston | first=Clifford | year=1993 | month=September | title=Economic deregulation:  days of reckoning for microeconomists | journal=Journal of Economic Literature | volume=31 | issue=3 | pages=1263-1289 | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2728241 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The Interstate Commerce Commission was later formally abolished in 1995, though some of its regulatory powers were transferred to a new agency, the [[w:Surface Transportation Board|Surface Transportation Board]].

== Theory of Contestable Markets ==
Typically, a limited number of producers in an industry (monopoly being the extreme case) is thought to lead to outcomes which deviate from the ideal of competitive markets.  However, economists have more recently discovered conditions under which markets can function competitively, even in the absence of a large number of producers.  Baumol, Panzar and Willig &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baumol |first=William J. |coauthors=John C. Panzar, Robert D. Willig |title=Contestable Markets and the Theory of Industry Structure |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; formalized the conditions under which natural monopolies could be expected to reach efficient equilibria without regulation, an idea put forward by Harold Demsetz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Demsetz | first=Harold | year=1968 | month=April | title=Why regulate utilities? | journal=Journal of Law and Economics | volume=11 | issue=1 | pages=55-65 | url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/jlecono11&amp;div=9&amp;g_sent=1#61 | accessdate=2010-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; earlier.  This theory, known as the theory of [[w:Contestable market|contestable markets]], broadened the potential areas in which the outcome of perfect competition applies.  Some of the principles of contestable market theory suggest that:

*Potential competition can replace actual competition
*A single firm (monopoly) may behave like a competitive firm
*A crucial condition for a market to be contestable is ''free entry and exit''

Levine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Levine | first=Michael E. | year-1987 | title=Airline competition in deregulated markets:  theory, firm strategy, and public policy | journal=Yale Journal on Regulation | volume=4 | pages=393-494 | url=http://www.theairlinezone.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/AIRLINE-COMPETITION-IN-DEREGULATED-MARKETS.pdf | format=pdf | accessdate=2010-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see page 404) identified some of the conditions considered by economists to be necessary in order for markets to be contestable.  They included:

*equal access to scale economies and technology, whether expressed as access to competitive levels of unit cost or as equivalent access to product quality
*no [[w:Sunk costs|sunk costs]] -- a firm can enter and exit without entry and exit costs, including operating losses resulting from predation.
*price sustainability, there is a set of prices that can occur after the entry of at least one firm which will support profitable operation.
* free entry: no entry barrier
* costless exit

The concept of contestable markets provided a broader condition supporting deregulation of transportation markets than the assumption of perfect competition.  It was no longer implicitly assumed that markets in which there were not a large number of actual competitors could not function competitively in the absence regulation.

=== Implications for Regulation ===
Contestable market theory has several implications for regulation.  For example, there is little need for regulation if sunk costs in an industry are low, thus regulation should be designed to focus on industries with substantial sunk costs. In that case regulation should regulate sunk facilities only and  modify institutional arrangements for sunk assets. Regulators can rely on contestability theory only partially in deregulated airline markets mainly due to existence of entry barriers.

Several studies looking at the airline industry have pointed out that the airline market is only partially contestable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bailey | first=Elizabeth E. | couathors=John C. Panzar | year=1981 | title=The contestability of airline markets during the transition to deregulation | journal=Law and Contemporary Problems | volume=44 | issue=1 | pages=125-145 | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1191388 | accessdate=2010-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and that the existence of actual competition is more effective than potential competition, as determined by the overall level of welfare provided by the market&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morrison |first=Steven A. |coauthors=Clifford Winston |year=1987 |month=April |title=Empirical implications and tests of the contestability hypothesis |journal=Journal of Law and Economics |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=53-66 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/725391 |accessdate=2010-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Fares in markets with potential competition were also shown to be lower than in completely monopolized markets, but higher than in markets with actual competition.  The implications of these findings are that regulators should concern themselves more with fostering competition in airline markets, for example by reducing barriers to entry, in order to achieve more of the benefits from competition.

Thank you Ravichandar. I am actually not new here. I used the name Iarlagab before and forgot to consolidate that under my universal account :-(

== Thanks ==
Dear Jcwf, thanks for your attention. Congratulations on your contribution on the Dutch book, there is a lot of work there. I had not noticed that my discussion was back, I had deleted it (and wrote a softer comment)(and never came back to that book), because that discussion lead to a very long and tiring dispute, that went everywhere (with more deleted discussions), up to the Reading room. Unfortunately the dispute had nothing to do with &quot;learning Dutch&quot;, but with &quot;supposed to be wikimanners&quot;. I appreciate your tolerance and understanding that my comment is honest, although provocative. In art we are used to hard comments, aren´t we? I even enjoy them. Please tell me, if possible, what part of Netherlands are you from? (I wanted to learn Dutch because I am considering moving there with my wife). What would be a &quot;second best&quot; city to live? Rotterdam or Den Haag? (I say &quot;second best&quot; because amsterdam was my first choice, but it is almost out of our shortlist) (rents too high... stupid reason?)(I know, for some people my second options are their first options).
kind regards: )
--[[User:Ricardoramalho|Ricardoramalho]] ([[User talk:Ricardoramalho|talk]]) 12:41, 27 June 2009 (UTC)   PS: I promess not to bother you too much

:Dear Jcwf! Thanks for the tips on Rotterdam!! (cultural programs are a vital aspect, it is interesting your view that Rdam has more of it than Adam). It has been hard to find positive comments on Rotterdam recently, I have been probably asking the wrong persons about it. 

:Regarding the pronunciation tool in the Dutch book, it is okay. When I click on the icon it opens the itunes... which is good for ipod transfering. Another approach to pronunciation is the system in www.merriam-webster.com it is faster, but it cannot be stored in Itunes as easily. Feel free to ask me for more help with the Dutch book anytime! The next week up to July 3 I will be quite busy writing works for my masters degree, but after that I will have more time to study the Dutch book. keep in touch! --[[User:Ricardoramalho|Ricardoramalho]] ([[User talk:Ricardoramalho|talk]]) 11:32, 28 June 2009 (UTC)</text>

Why are you starting with partial derivatives? Start the book by using the most simple form and build on it. Don't start off by scaring a reader. [[Special:Contributions/70.241.78.242|70.241.78.242]] ([[User talk:70.241.78.242|talk]]) 18:16, 10 October 2008 (UTC)

There appears to be a typo in this page. Where it says: &quot;Specifically if &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}(x,y)=P(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}(x,y)=Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;&quot;, it should be &quot;&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\partial\psi}{\partial y}(x,y)=Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;&quot; (Q(x,y) is the partial wrt y) [[Special:Contributions/69.255.224.70|69.255.224.70]] ([[User talk:69.255.224.70|discuss]]) 20:55, 15 January 2011 (UTC)</text>

Like all forms of chromatography, HPLC consists of a stationary phase and a mobile phase. The stationary phase is some solid material packed into the column, while the mobile phase is a liquid solvent that carries the analyzed compound through the column. 

Chromatography operates on the principle of polarity where the compound interacts with the solid stationary phase based on their differences in polarity. In general, if the stationary phase is very polar, a non-polar component of the compound would exit the column faster than a polar component would.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:37, 11 October 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The story of life on Earth is a fascinating one. Life is more interesting than almost anything else -- certainly more interesting than simple rocks, water, and gases. Life is above all else a very complex set of chemistry known as biochemistry -- the chemistry of life itself. 

So far as we know the Earth is the only place in the universe with life. We may find other places in time, places with very different life. We may even create life. But life has to come from somewhere.

When it formed, the Earth had no life. It couldn't hold life; its surface was hot from either a glob of congealing, molten rock or from giant pieces of rock slamming together. It may have had no gases, and certainly no liquid water. Deadly ultraviolet radiation would have killed anything. But eventually as the rocks cooled, some of them released some of the chemicals of life. Most importantly, liquid water emerged from the rocks or fell to the early Earth and formed early lakes, seas, and oceans. Some of the water evaporated and formed clouds from which rain fell. Other substances emerged from the rocks, like rock phosphates and salts of magnesium, calcium, sodium, potassium, and iron. Some others may have been captured from space when the planets were young, such gases as carbon dioxide or carbon monxide, methane, ammonia, and hydrogen sulfide. Some of those chemicals are dangerous to us -- like hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, methane, and carbon monoxide. Don't worry; we weren't around for them to hurt us. There was no oxygen; that would come into existence later.

A remarkable experiment in 1954 by the physicist Harold Urey and the chemist Stanley Miller showed how the early chemicals of life came into existence. They put small amounts of water, ammonia, and methane into chemical flasks and simulated lightning upon the chemicals. (Don't try this at home!) They got some chemicals known as amino acids necessary for proteins. Other people have done similar experiments with slight changes and gotten slightly different effects -- but also the chemicals essential to life.  

Sulfur was necessary for some vital proteins for all later life, and where there a little hydrogen sulfide, some of those proteins were possible. But proteins are not life themselves. Life cannot form until it has some unique substances called RNA and DNA that control the chemistry of life and define life itself. DNA and RNA require phosphates, compounds that contain phosphorus and oxygen. Life came into existence when it controlled its own chemistry, defined itself in cells, and reproduced. 

We don't know the whole story of life. Much of it is genetics whose chemical basis is DNA or RNA -- and every living thing has its own DNA or RNA (if not both). They are very complicated compounds with subtle effects. We don't know how cells came into existence -- yet. We can't create life -- but we know that it came into existence. 

Life became increasingly complex. Some of it simply devoured the early material of life. Some devoured creatures that came into existence before it. Some (most of which would become plants) used sunlight to get energy to store in sugars. Plants would do a process called photosynthesis -- taking carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight and turning them into sugar (their own food) and oxygen. 

Plants released oxygen into the atmosphere, but only from water. The lands were barren of life of any kind for millions of years. Some animals began to eat plants, and some animals ate the animals that ate the plants. All animals would use oxygen. But oxygen would enter the atmosphere. Some of the oxygen would go to the top of the atmosphere and become ozone that would absorb deadly ultraviolet radiation. Then, and only then could animals and plants enter the land.  By then the Earth was no longer young. But the chemistry of life was itself very old by then, and that chemistry has changed little to our time -- but  the great variation possible due to subtle differences DNA and RNA now makes possible the great variety of life -- and even the uniqueness of you and me.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Why shouldn't we add the little cats and change the title to &quot;Cats&quot;?

The domestic cat is so obviously similar in build and behavior to all of the bigger cats, and several of the Big Cats are so compared. The only anomaly for the domestic cat is its relationship to humans. The other small cats have their own stories.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== General Information ==

&lt;b&gt;Gel-filtration chromatography&lt;/b&gt; is the simplest and mildest technique that separates molecules based on their size difference (also known as hydrodynamic volume). This way each polypeptide is purified from other different sized polypeptides. Gel-Filtration Chromatography is also known as '''&lt;b&gt;Size-Exclusion chromatography&lt;/b&gt;''', '''&lt;b&gt;Molecular-Exclusion chromatography&lt;/b&gt;''' or '''&lt;b&gt;Molecular Sieve chromatography&lt;/b&gt;'''.
 
When an organic solvent is used as a mobile phase, chemists tend to call it &lt;b&gt;Gel permeation chromatography&lt;/b&gt;. This technique is used to analyze the molar mass distribution of organic-soluble polymers. It was invented by Grant Henry Lathe and Colin Ruthren who were working at Queen Charlotte's Hospital in London, United Kingdom. 

The sample solution is applied to the top of a column containing a stationary phase of porous beads made of an insoluble but highly hydrated polymer such as dextran or agarose. These beads span a relatively narrow size range. When an aqueous solution of molecules of various sizes is passed through a column containing these 'molecular sieves,' small molecules can enter them but the large ones cannot. As a result, the big molecules are located in the solution around the beads while the smaller ones are able to penetrate the beads and the solution between them. The most important point is that large molecules flow more rapidly through this column and emerge first because a smaller volume is accessible to them and this is what enables the collection of fractions where the first set collected contains bigger molecules and the last set contains smaller molecules. And, theoretically, molecules that have the same size should elute simultaneously. An elution diagram, or a chromatogram, can be constructed to verify complete separation.

Within the size range of molecules that are subjected to gel-filtration chromatography and are separated by a particular pore size of beads in the column, there is a linear relationship between the relative elution volume of a substance (i.e., the volume of the fractions in which the molecule is found)and the logarithm of its molecular mass (this is assuming that the molecules have similar shapes). If a given gel filtration column is calibrated with several proteins of known molecular mass, the mass of an unknown protein can be estimated by its elution position.


== Analogy ==
An analogy to understand (this is CONCEPTUAL, not even remotely a literal representation of what happens in ME chromatography) why gel filtration works is to picture several whiffle balls (or sponges or Swiss cheese-whatever cratered object works for you) suspended in a glass tank.  Now imagine that you have a mixture of sand, small marbles, and golf balls in a bucket; you dump it in.  As you watch, first the golf balls reach the floor of the tank, then the marbles, and finally a layer of sand settles.  Why?  Essentially all of the sand goes into the holes of the whiffle balls(or Swiss cheeses or sponges), and it tends to fall from the interior of one whiffle ball to the interior of another,  significantly slowing passage of the sand to the bottom of the tank.  The marbles are only slightly smaller than the holes in the whiffle ball, so they sometimes fall into the holes on the way down but also sometimes bounce off; again, the whiffle balls slow their progress, but to a lesser extent.  The golf balls are way too big to fit the holes of a whiffle ball, and so they push straight through the whiffle balls--the fastest and most direct route. 
Key: sand=small molecules; marbles=medium molecules; golf balls=large molecules; whiffle balls=porous beads; tank of water=column &amp; aqueous solution

== General Procedure ==
First, apply the sample or mixture to the top of the gel filtration column that is filled with insoluble carbohydrate polymer beads with different sizes of pores. [Agarose, dextran, or polyacrylamide are usually used as the stationary phase (gel medium) under low pressure. However, silica or cross-linked polystyrene can also be used as a stationary phase under a higher pressure.]
As the mixture flows towards to the bottom of the column, large molecules will emerge first because they cannot distribute inside the beads - they can only exist in between the beads in the column and they have a smaller accessible volume, whereas smaller molecules can distributed into both inside and between the beads. Thus, small molecules will take a long time to elute because they have a longer tortuous path before they come to the exit of the column.


Gel-Filtration Chromatography is commonly used for analysis of synthetic and biological polymers such as nucleic acid, proteins, and polysaccharides. A downfall to this technique is that the stationary phase may also interact in an undesirable way with a molecule and affect its retention time.

Gel-Filtration Chromatography should not be confused with gel electrophoresis, where electricity is applied to create an electric field to separate molecules through the gel towards the electrode (anode and cathode) depending on their electric charge.

Look at the following pictures. 
The caption below each picture describes in Punjabi the object in the picture. 
Once you have recognized the objects, use your knowledge of Gurmukhi to read the captions. 
The captions contain the initial letter of the object name besides the object name in Punjabi and in English. 
Follow this by loudly reading each caption without the English word. 
Take the help of the sound file if necessary. 
Practise it repeatedly till you master it i.e. till you are able to fluently speak it.

== Muharni ==
Welcome to Muharni, the next big step in learning Punjabi. 
You will learn here how to speak Punjabi words by a lot of practice. 

''If you have not mastered the Gurmukhi script you are strongly advised to go back to the [[Punjabi/Gurmukhi|Gurmukhi]] script module and practise thoroughly before returning. In this module you will be expected to have the basic skills of using the letters, matras and the diacritics.''

You have already learnt the Gurmukhi script. 
You came across many English examples to illustrate the sounds 
represented by the Gurmukhi letters. 
We now gradually introduce you to Punjabi words. 
Muharni is the traditional way of learning words by reciting them. 
Muharni consists of the letters of Gurmukhi script in its natural order each letter 
followed by a word starting with that letter. 
It is recited as a rhyme. 
The result is that while you learn some 
Punjabi words you also acquire some proficiency in speaking Punjabi. 

The Muharni module will consist of 8 chapters and shall be finished in two weeks. 
You are expected to practice thoroughly each lesson before moving to the next. The final lesson contains all the words learnt in other lessons. You can assume that you are ready to move to the next module if you can continously speak all the words of the full muharni.

== Re-order words ==

Perhaps the purpose of this page would be better served if the words were not in the same order as the main survival kit table?  When looking at this table, I find that I'm not so much remembering the meaning of the word as the English meaning of the word in that position.  Thoughts?

Look at the following pictures. 
The caption below each picture describes in Punjabi the object in the picture. 
Once you have recognized the objects, use your knowledge of Gurmukhi to read the captions. 
The captions contain the initial letter of the object name besides the object name in Punjabi and in English. 
Follow this by loudly reading each caption without the English word. 
Take the help of the sound file if necessary. 
Practise it repeatedly till you master it i.e. till you are able to fluently speak it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ion Exchange Chromatography (IEC)''' is a [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification|purification]] method aimed at separating proteins based on charge. A column is packed with a resin (usually cellulose or agarose) with a charged group bonded to it. For a positively charged resin, a protonated diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) group is used. For negatively charged resin, a deprotonated carboxymethyl (CM) group is used. Ion exchange chromatography consists of cation exchange chromatography and anion exchange chromatography. Whatever one wants to purify is known as the sample and the parts that are separated are known as the analytes. The sample is added to the top of the column and a buffered solution is used to elute it.

==Techniques==
In cation exchange chromatography, a sample consisting of a certain protein that bears a net positive charge at a certain pH is a added to a column. In anion exchange chromatography, a sample with a protein that bears a net negative charge at a certain pH is added to a column. (Anet charge is the sum of partial charges for each amino acid's particular R group at a given pH). The columns have resin that consists of cellulose (or agarose) beads, which have a function group covalently bonded to it. For cation exchange a carboxylate group is used, and for anion exchange a diethylaminoethyl group is used. A buffer solution, also called a mobile phase, has its pH set between the pl or pKa of protein and the pKa of the beads on the columns. The buffer solution then runs the sample through the column. Molecules with no charge or the same charge as the beads will pass through, while molecules with the opposite charge will bind to the column of beads. Like a magnet, it'll stick and stay there. To elute the bound proteins, the column is flushed with  a salt, usually excess NaCl. In cation exchange chromatography the Na+ ion will compete with the bound protein for the negative functional group, and in anion exchange chromatography, the Cl- ion will compete to bind the columns. Another way to flush the system would be with a low pH buffer. The more acidic conditions will lower the net charge (or make it more positive) of the protein. Since the protein now bears a positive net charge, it no longer feels compelled to be around the like-charged resin (since like charges repel), and it'll come out of the column pure. 

If there are impurities in the sample that have a similar charge of the protein being isolated, a pH gradient buffer solution is needed. Unless the proteins have exactly the same amino acids, it is unlikely that they will have exactly the same charge at the same exact pH. Raising (or lowering) the pH, which is in effect causing more molecules to be deprotonated (or protonated), will cause the molecule to have a slight change in charge negatively (or positively). This will affect the ionic interaction between the molecule and the resin, causing some of the molecules to elute from the column. By changing the pH, different molecules will have different charge densities (or degree of negative charge; -2,-1,-3, etc.). So at a certain pH, a protein might have a higher or lower charge density and will thus bind to the resin differently, and those with a lower charge density will elute first.

For another example, say we are analyzing an air sample that has been collected onto an air filter and put through filter extraction (adding water to the filter, purifying by putting through another filter, and extracting the water to be the sample). The samples are then further prepared to put into the IC (ion chromatograph) by adding a given amount of the sample and a given amount of a water. A series of standard solutions and water are first put through the IC in order to calibrate the instrument. The standard solutions consist of certain cation or anion, depending on which ion chromatography is being performed, that are to be detected in the samples. Once all the samples have been put through the IC an ion chromatrogram (see image)is created for each standard and sample solution. In the ion chromatogram the analyte separation can been seen. Each analyte travels through the column at a different rate due to the positively or negatively charged resin. In the ion chromatogram the time at which it takes each analyte to pass through as well as the amount present can be seen. Each analyte will travel through the column at a consistent time in each sample thus each peak can be determined to be certain analytes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Important|Please save your work periodically.}}

==Creating the Scene==
*Open ''css-lr300-idle.exp''.
*Go to File&gt;Save As. Save it as ''css-lr300-shoot.exp''.
*Match the scene's FPS with the QC's shoot1/2/3 fps. (You should already know how to do this from the idle animation page.) The fps for the sg552 draw animation is 37.
*Match the scene's end frame with the SMD's end frame minus one. (31 - 1 = 30). The end frame is 30 for the sg552 draw animation.
*Find the null ''Frame''. Below the ''Parent'' button, there is a ''CnsComp'' button. Press it.
*Click the word ''Constrain'' above the ''Parent'' button, and click ''Pose''.
*Click the left hand null. Now whenever you rotate or move the hand, the gun will follow it.
*Now constrain the right arm to the left hand.

==Animating==
*Set keys for rotation and translation (hint: '''VKCK''') at the last frame for every null in the scene. This ensures that the gun is in its idle position after it is drawn.}}
{{NOTE|The draw animation can be really easy or really hard depending on how you want it to look. The easy way is to make one start frame and one end frame so the gun just rotates out to its idle position. The hard way is to add a bolt pull some aesthetic move while drawing the weapon. This tutorial will explain the easy way.}}
*Set the current frame to 0.
*Set a key for the left hand and left arm at where you want the gun to begin drawing out.
*Review the animation in the ''Camera'' viewport.

==FCurve Editor==
*Press '''0''' to bring up the FCurve Editor.
*Select a null such as the hand.
*Click one of the rotation items. (rotx, roty, rotz)
*At the bottom there is an animation marker that you can move around.
*On the left and right there will be keys. Keys are represented as little colored squares in the FCurve Editor.
*Click one of them.
*Now a little black handle will pop out of the key. Drag it around to edit the interpolation.
*Some shortcuts:
**'''Shift+Z''': Rectangular zoom
**'''A''': Frame curve
**'''S''': Multi-purpose navigation tool (Similar to using '''S''' in a viewport.)
*Now you can edit the interpolation (in between frames) of the draw animation as a curve. Experiment and have fun with it.
*There are also plenty of buttons and fields.
**One useful button is the ''Linear Interpolation'' button. This will straighten out a curve's interpolation. It is useful when you have two keys at two different places and you want them to stay and not move.
**Another useful button is the ''Add Key'' button. Its icon has a picture of a key with a plus sign on it. Click it and then click on somewhere on the FCurve plane to add a key. To exit Add Key mode, click the button with the picture of a cursor on the far left.
*Toward the top of the FCurve editor are text boxes for Frame and Key values. To use these, select a key and set the values using the text boxes.
==Adding an Inverse Kinematic Controller==
{{NOTE|This is another way to make a draw animation.}}
{{Tip|A forward kinematic controller is useful for changing the pivot of a null.}}
*A controller is an object used to control another object from a different location. See [[../Questions|Questions]] if you don't know what inverse kinematics are.
*For this animation it is useful to add an inverse kinematic bone to the supporting arm. The supporting arm supplies some of the force that brings out the weapon.
*Press '''2''' to bring up the green animation panel on the left.
*On the left hand panel under ''Create'', select Skeleton&gt;Draw 2D Chain.
*Click on any two points on any viewport. Then right click.
*Make sure all three elements that you have just created are selected. Press '''Control+Shift+R''' to reset their positions.
*Select each object individually and reset their locations again.
*Press '''Control+J''' to bring up the Move Joint tool.
*Put the root on the elbow area of the supporting arm.
*Put the effector on the wrist joint.
*Rotate the bone so the effector's axes properly line up with the rotation of the arm.
*Right click any part of the chain (root, bone, or effector) to select its components.
*Click ''Transform'' on the right panel and click ''Set Neutral Pose''.
*Setting keys for an inverse kinematic chain using the shortcut ''K'' is ambiguous in XSI. It is better done in the animation editor.
*Using what you have learned about the FCurve editor animate the root and effector in the FCurve Editor. Try to think about how the root's and effector's movement are represented in real life.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The process of &quot;salting out&quot; is a [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification|purification]] method that relies on the basis of [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]] solubility. It relies on the principle that most proteins are less soluble in solutions of high salt concentrations because additional ions of the salt shield protein with multi-ions charges. Those charges help protein molecules interact, aggregate, and precipitate. The exact concentration resulting in precipitation varies from protein to protein, allowing separation of different proteins (as they will precipitate at different points when increasing salt concentration).  Salting out can also concentrate dilute solutions of proteins; once the protein precipitates, the remaining liquid can be removed. However, the salt can pose a problem to the purity of protein. 

&quot;Salting in&quot; refers to the observation that at dilute solutions of low salt concentrations, the solubility of the protein increases. As the solubility of the salt added in higher than protein, it is more likely dissolve and take most of the space in the solution; therefore, proteins aggreate and precipitate.  Whereas, its opposite, &quot;salting out,&quot; requires high salt concentration for the precipitation of the protein. There are two ways of &quot;salting out&quot;.  One in which proteins are exposed to high concentrations of salt solutions, and the other is where the proteins are exposed to a series of low concentrated solutions. 

Proteins contain various sequences and compositions of amino acids. Therefore, their solubility to water differs depending on the level of [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrophobic interaction|hydrophobic ]] or hydrophilic properties of the surface.  Proteins with surfaces that have greater hydrophobic properties will readily precipitate. The addition of ions creates an electron shielding effect that nullifies some activity between water particles and the protein, reducing solubility as the proteins bind with each other and begin to aggregate. Generally, larger proteins require less ionic input than do smaller proteins with lesser weight.

In the process of using low concentrations of salt solutions, the proteins are precipitated early in the process.  In order to extract the proteins from the solution, cold solutions of ammonium sulfate at a series of decreasing concentrations are used on the precipitate.  In order to recover the extracted protein, it is then recrystallized by warming the cold solution to room temperature.  This process has many advantages because depending on the extracted protein, the efficiency rate can run anywhere from 30-90%, and rarely fails.

Ammonium sulfate is common substance to precipitate proteins selectively since it is very soluble in water, it allows high concentration about 4M. At this state, harmful effects of proteins like irreversible denaturation are absent and NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; are both favourable, non-denaturing, end of the Hofmeister series. Ammonium sulfate provides quantative precipitation of one protein from the mixture. This method is very useful to purify soluble proteins from the cell extracts.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
 
While proving itself to be an efficient method of protein separation, salting out requires that the solubility of the protein to be calculated or known initially. Proteins have differing amino acid chains and solubility. In trying to change the salt concentration to the point where the protein becomes insoluble, different ions can either increase or decrease the solubility of the protein. Hence, one must be careful in selecting the correct ions to alter salt concentration.  A protein is typically least soluble near its isoelectric point, pI, or where it contains minimal net charge. The precipitation by salting out results in fractionation. An amount of precipitated protein is collected at one salt concentration and another amount from a different concentration. This is because some parts of the protein may be more soluble than another region.

Proteins with different pI values can be separated with salting out techniques via dynamic pH values in varying salt concentration.  Since proteins are least soluble near their isoelectric point (pI), it is possible to cause them to precipitate them out of solution by increasing the salt concentration. This is possible since the hydration shell surrounding the protein structure is displaced by the increasing ionic concentration in the solvent. Thus by replacing the hydration shell with other ions, the water networks that solubilize proteins and allow for
aggregation at high salt concentration due to hydrophobic groups coming together become destabilized. Ultimately proteins are precipitated with aggregation (or &quot;crashed out&quot;). This technique can be used to separate proteins that initially have similar precipitation points.  By modifying the pH of the solution, one can increase or decrease the solubility of one protein without affecting the target protein.  Furthermore, the solution can later be purified by using dialysis to remove the salt ions in solution.

== Hofmeister Series ==
The effectiveness of the different ions was established by Franz Hofmeister in 1888. The first ion in the anion and cation series is the most effective in precipitating a protein out (dubbed &quot;kosmotropes&quot;: ions that interact well with water, forming H-bonds and dehydrating proteins), and the ions at the end are the least (&quot;chaotropes&quot;: ions that free up water by breaking H-bonds between [[Structural Biochemistry/Water|water]] molecules, increasing protein solubility). {{note|ProteinsStruc}}

'''Cations''': N(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; guanidinium

'''Anions''': SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; citrate &gt; tartrate &gt; F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Br&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; I&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; SCN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

The starting molecules strengthen hydrophobic interactions by decreasing solubility of the nonpolar molecules, thus salting out the system. However, the later molecules begin to denature the structure of the protein because of strong ionic interactions that disrupt hydrogen bonding. Although the later molecules can be salted out through solutions such as Ammonia Sulfate, certain molecules can also experience salting in, where the solubility of the protein increases through the later molecules of the list.

==Dialysis==

Dialysis is a protein [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification|purification]] process that separates proteins from other small molecules, such as salt, by using a semipermeable membrane. This membrane contain micro pores through which the small molecules will escape. Therefore, protein molecules having dimensions significantly greater than the pore diameter are retained inside the dialysis bag. The small molecules and salt will diffuse out through the membrane and into the dialysate outside of the bag. This technique is useful to remove salt ions and other small molecule but can not be used to distinguish proteins. To enhance the separation of the proteins in the bag from other impurities such as salt we can also take advantage of the equilibrium constants. In an aqueous environment the salt will flow through the plasma membrane until its concentration outside the dialysis bag is equal to the concentration inside the bag. At this point there is no net flow of salt through the membrane because equilibrium is reached. But if we add in a new solution of buffer, then the remaining amount of salt will then flow out of the dialysis bag until the concentration of salt in the new buffer equals the concentration in the dialysis bag. If we keep replacing the buffer solution this will enhance the purity of the proteins inside the dialysis bag because each time we replace the buffer the salt has to flow out inorder to attain its equilibrium constant. This principle can also be applied for other impurities that are able to escape through the membrane.

==Dialysis in human body==

In kidney-compromised patients, dialysis is often used as a procedure for removing undesirable solutes in the blood.  For example, the calcium, potassium, and urea concentration of the dialysate is kept at low concentrations, enabling the target solutes in the blood to diffuse across the semi-permeable membrane.  However, this entails the dialysate to be constantly cleaned in order to prevent concentration equilibrium, which would ultimately lead to a rising concentration of unwanted solutes in the blood.  In another case, solutes can also be introduced into the blood.  For example, bicarbonate ions are in high concentration in the dialysate, which diffuse across the membrane.  This is done to prevent metabolic acidosis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Eventually, [[WB:ADMIN]] and [[WB:BOT]] (if ever approved) should get merged to here. Or maybe this should be a dab page and all rights get their own page... &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:08, 12 October 2008 (UTC)

:I think merging them into a single policy wouldn't be a bad idea, but I wonder if we'd ever be able to agree to it as one policy. I think the name needs to change though, maybe &quot;User tools&quot;. &quot;User rights&quot; might be confused with a Terms of Service type policy or what rights users have to use Wikibooks. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:33, 18 October 2008 (UTC)
::If they're all policies, then does it really matter what page(s) they're on? We don't have to re-negotiate [[Wikibooks:Administrators]] if we decide to move it elsewhere, do we? Or if we want to create [[Wikibooks:Bureaucrats]], we wouldn't need to have a discussion about what the policy would say, since that's already been determined (in [[Wikibooks:Administrators]]). So, I'd like to see the bot policy improved and approved first, then we can figure out if there's a more logical way to organize the policies concerning user rights. (And perhaps &quot;User rights&quot; isn't the best title) &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:34, 18 October 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>[[WB:REVERT|Reverted]] edits by [[Special:Contributions/184.90.150.174|184.90.150.174]] ([[User talk:184.90.150.174|talk]]) to last version by Adrignola</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This page documents two bots used extensively by countervandalism channels.

==Bot overview==
'''Computer''' was the original recent changes filtering bot written as a [[w:mIRC scripting language|mIRC script]], developed by [[user:White Cat|White Cat]]. It was replaced by pgkbot in 2005.

'''pgkbot''' is a [[w:Python (programming language)|python]] bot developed by [[user:pgk|pgk]]. It is designed for use in one channel, and includes a number of customization options such as plugin support, complex event routers, individual lists, individual user name and article title watchlists, detection of page move vandalism, and IP address categories (like open proxies). However, configuration is difficult and it is relatively resource-intensive.

'''SWBot''' is a [[w:C Sharp|C#]] bot developed by [[user:Tangotango|Tangotango]] and [[user:Az1568|Az1568]]. It is designed for use in networked or multiwiki channels. Features include dynamic loading and unloading of wikis and channels, a central configuration file and database, global lists, auto-broadcast of global changes to all other SWBot instances, and detection of page blanking and replacement using automated MediaWiki summaries. However, per-channel event configuration is not possible.

'''CVNbot''' is a unified centralized bot written in Perl by [[user:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]]. It is currently in development and not actively used. The bot is intended to facilitate channel network administration and provide edit monitoring, without extraneous features.

==pgkbot==
: ''Common bots: ErosionBot-1, MiszaBot, TheDJBot, ClueBot(RC).''

===Operation===
====Using commands====
Commands are issued to the bot by appending their name or &quot;computer&quot; to the beginning of the line. If you append the name, the command will only be recognized by the bot named. If you append &quot;computer&quot;, all bots present will recognize the command. For example, if you want to add a user to pgkbot's blacklist, you would say ''&lt;code&gt;pgkbot bl add username&lt;/code&gt;''. Alternately, you could add the user to the blacklist of every bot in the channel. This is recommended, as it synchronises the backup bots. To do this, you would say ''&lt;code&gt;computer bl add username&lt;/code&gt;''.

Which commands a user can issue depends on which list they are in.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size:0.9em;&quot;
! Level !! Users !! List of commands
|-
| '''Information'''
| Any user
| intelligence commands; ''help''.
|-
| '''Operation'''
| Voiced users
| watchlist; intelligence; ''help'', ''status'', ''quiet'', ''speak''.
|-
| '''Restricted'''
| Channel operators
| all commands.
|}

====Lists of users====
The bots maintain several lists of users, which can be reported, formatted, and treated differently from each other.

* '''Admins:'''  this is a list of admins on the project. The relevant command is ''&lt;code&gt;computer al add|del username&lt;/code&gt;''.
* '''Whitelist:''' this is the list of trusted users. The relevant command is ''&lt;code&gt;computer wl add|del username&lt;/code&gt;''.
* '''Greylist:''' this is a temporary blacklist which the bot automatically populates with users that have recently been reverted, or matched one of the bnu list expression. Entries can be removed from the list, but cannot be added manually.
* '''Blacklist:''' this is a list of suspicious users. All edits by blacklisted users are reported. The relevant command is ''&lt;code&gt;computer bl add|del username&lt;/code&gt;''.
* '''Bots:''' this is a list of bots on the project. The relevant command is ''&lt;code&gt;computer bot add|del user&lt;/code&gt;''.

====Reference table====
This table is a quick overview of commands. For additional help, address the following command to pgkbot on IRC: ''&lt;code&gt;pgkbot help &amp;lt;command&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;''. There are two optional flags which can be used with most commands. These can be used by appending them to the end of the command (expiry must be stated before the reason, if both are used).
* &quot;''&lt;code&gt;r=value&lt;/code&gt;''&quot; provides a reason. This is useful for other users, who may not know why something has been added to the list without.
* &quot;''&lt;code&gt;x=value&lt;/code&gt;''&quot; provides an expiry time in hours. After the specified number of hours, the command will be automatically undone.

Note that the symbols &quot;[|]&quot; are used in the table; these symbols should ''not'' be used with the bot (for example, use &quot;pgk add blah&quot; and not &quot;pgk [add] blah&quot;). Multiple possible actions are denoted as [option 1|option 2]; only one can be used at a time. Values are designated as &lt;value&gt;; all strings accept [[w:regex|regex]].

===Installation===
====Pre-requisites====
* '''Python:''' The bot requires the python environment to run, which is freely available from the [http://www.python.org/download/ python.org download page]. It is recommended that you install for all users to &lt;tt&gt;C:\Python&lt;/tt&gt; with all options enabled.
* '''Twisted:''' Also required is the Twisted python library, available from the [http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads official website].
*'''Note''' - Pgkbot can only work with Python version 2.4 or 2.5 and will not work with older versions.

# pgkbot will be silent upon connecting. Be sure to make it speak and route some events (see above).

==SWMTBot==
: ''Common bots: SWBot* (except SWBot2), SWMTBot*, TheDJBot(3-5).''

===Comparison with pgkbot===
SWMTBot is a port of pgkbot to C#, specially made to suit the needs of the [[m:Small Wiki Monitoring Team|Small Wiki Monitoring Team]] and other users who monitor a large number of feeds in one channel. Most commands have been kept identical to their pgkbot equivalents except where necessary; messages have also been kept as close to pgkbot's as possible.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Features new to SWMTBot
! Features in pgkbot but not in SWMTBot
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
| 
* Hot-pluggable wikis (load/unload on demand)
* Supports simultaneous monitoring of a very large number of wikis with minimal resource usage
* One small configuration file containing information for all wikis
* One SQLite database, using minimal resources, for all wikis
* Global blacklists/whitelists/greylists
* Global username/article title watchlists (supports regular expressions)
* Global edit summary watchlist (flags potentially vandalistic edit summaries; supports regular expressions)
* Auto-broadcast of all global lists to other SWMTBots
* Catches page blankings/replacements (using the new autosummaries)
|
* Plugins
* A choice of database backends
* Telnet interface
* Complex destination/event routers
* Individual blacklists/whitelists
* Individual username/article title watchlists
* Wheeler detection
* IP categories
* Command renaming
|}

===Usage===
====Lists====
All '''global''' lists are automatically synchronized across all SWMTBots; '''per-wiki''' lists are not. There is a global article watchlist for all wikis, and one for each one; you can add/delete/show items on the global list by leaving out the &quot;p=&quot; parameter (see the command lists below for more information).

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Global lists
! Per-wiki lists
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|
* Bad new usernames (BNU)
* Bad new article titles (BNA)
* Bad edit summaries (BES)
* User whitelist (WL)
* User blacklist (BL)
* User greylist (GL)
* Global article watchlist (CVP)
|
* Lists of admins (AL)
* Lists of bots (BOTS)
* Article watchlists (CVP)

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Metal-affinity column.jpg|thumb|An affinity column.]]

Affinity chromatography is an applicable technique used to purify [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]]. It is performed depending on the advantage of the high affinity of proteins for specific chemical groups. Affinity chromatography was discovered by Pedro Cuatrecasas and Meir Wilcheck in 1968.

This process is generally used to isolate interested protein from the pool of proteins. A column is filled with beads that contain covalently attached glucose residues. It is taken in consideration that these residues are chosen corresponding to the target protein. As the protein mixture is poured into the column, the proteins will travel down through the beads. The target protein will be recognized and get trapped to the column by [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Covalent bonds|covalent]] bond because of its affinity for glucose. The rest of proteins will run down to the column and be separated. The portion of buffer needed to be added to the column to wash out completely the unbounded protein. Lastly, a concentrated solution of glucose with be added to separate the target protein from the column-attached glucose residues. 

The starting part included an undefined heterogeneous mixture of molecules in solution. The desired molecules will have defined property which can be exploited during the affinity purification process. The process is a setup in which the target molecule becoming trapped on stationary medium. The non-target heterogeneous mixture will not become trapped due to its unbounded ability. The solid medium can then be removed from the mixture, washed multiple times, and the target molecule released from the entrapment in a process known as elution with high concentration of specific chemicals or altering the conditions to decrease the binding ability. Also, it is important that the reaction is carried in an appropriate pH; otherwise, it may reduce the affinity and change the conformation of the proteins, preventing the target protein to bind to the residues as expected.

Affinity chromatography is a powerful means of isolating transcription factors, proteins that regulate gene expression by binding to specific [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]] sequences. A protein mixture is percolated through a column containing specific DNA sequences attached to a matrix. Proteins with a high affinity for the sequence will bind and be retained. In this instance, the transcription factor is released by washing with a solution containing a high concentration of salt. 

In general, affinity chromatography can be effectively used to isolate a protein that recognizes group X by:covalently attaching X or a derivative of it to a column, adding a mixture of proteins to this column, which is then washed with buffer to remove unbound proteins, eluting the desired protein by adding a high concentration of a soluble form of X or altering the conditions to decrease binding affinity. Affinity chromatography is most effective when the interaction of the protein and the molecule that is used as the bait is highly specific.

== Utilization ==
Affinity chromatography is mainly used in biochemistry to 

• Purify certain proteins from a mixture 

• Reduce the amount of a certain protein molecule in a mixture of multiple proteins

• Discover the affinity of substances to biological compounds, in this case protein.

[[Image:tinoCM.jpg|thumb| Carboxylmethyl group used to bind positive charge group]]

== Combinatorial Chemistry ==
Affinity chromatography can also be used in combinatorial chemistry (in-vitro evolution), in which you can imitate the process of evolution by creating large sets of molecules and selecting for a specific function. In this case, you start from a diverse population of molecules, then select for particular proteins, and reproduce that molecule. For instance, starting with a randomized pool of RNA segments and an ATP affinity column, you would apply the RNA pool to the top of the column. Next, you would allow the selection of ATP-binding molecules to occur, eluting from the RNA pool all the segments that did not bind to the ATP. Then to elute the bound RNA molecules, you apply ATP to the top of the column. This isolates the selected RNA molecules that are bound to ATP. You can expand this selection by using different salt concentrations, with increased salt concentrations being more selective.

== Immunoaffinity  Chromatography ==
An example of  immunoaffinity chromatography is  by   the use of blood antibodies. Blood antibodies  can  be  purified  by  use of affinity  purification form the  blood plasma (serum). If there is antibodies in the blood plasma that are against  some  particular antigen  we can use this for the antigen purification  by  using affinity.    
A common example to see if  an organism is  immune against a GST-fusion protein  by observing if it produces antibodies against  GST tag and the fusion-protein.  Foremost, the  GST affinity  matrix is allowed to  bind to the  blood plasma.  Allowing the blood plasma to  bind helps remove antibodies  against the GST. Separation of the blood plasma form the solid  helps it bind to the GST-fusion protein matrix which in turn  traps the antigen that is recognized by the antibody in the solid support. Using  low pH ( pH  3 )  buffers for  elution helps obtain the  desired antibodies. Collection of the eluate is mostly  done in phosphate buffer to neutralized the low pH.

==Immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC)==

IMAC is particular based on  coordination with covalent bonds form amino acids to metals. The concept of this technique  is to keep  in the  column proteins with affinity to the metal ions which get immobilized inside the column.  Iron, gallium  or  zinc can be used to  purify  phosphorylated proteins  or peptides.  Common metals for binding histidine are copper, cobalt, and  nickel.  DNA recombinant  technologies are use since  many  natural occurring proteins  do not  have affinity to metal ions.

== Interaction materials ==
These are typical biochemical interactions in nature that have been used extensively in affinity chromatography:

•  Enzyme will bind to substrate analogue, inhibitor, and cofactor

•  Lectin will bind to polysaccharide, glycoprotein, cell surface receptor, cell

•  Antibody will bind to antigen, virus, cell

•  Nucleic acid will attach to complementary base sequence, histones, nucleic acid polymerase, and nucleic acid binding protein

•  Hormone, vitamin will bind to receptor, carrier protein

•  Glutathione will bind to glutathione-S-transferase or GST fusion proteins

•  Metal ions will attach to Poly (His) fusion proteins, native proteins with histidine, cysteine and tryptophan residues on their surfaces.

==First technique==

Commonly, affinity chromatography will be done through column chromatography. First of all, the binding ability of protein must be studied. Then, the solid medium modified with the binding material is packed in a chromatography column. Then, the initial mixture that contained desired proteins was added through the column to allow binding to occur. A wash buffer was gradually added to the addition of mixture. The elution buffer subsequently removes unbounded protein from the column and collected. 

[[File:Affinity Chromatography Technique.jpg]]

== Elution Methods ==
There is no generally applicable elution methods for all affinity media. When substances are very tightly bounded to the affinity medium, it may be useful to stop the flow after applying eluent, usually 10 minutes to 2 hours is referred, before continuing the elution process. This extra time helps to improve recovery percentage of bounded protein.

Forces that maintain the complex of substrate and bound substances include electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bonding. Agents that deteriorate these interactions may be expected to function as efficient eluting agents. The optimal flow rate to achieve efficiency may vary according to the specific interaction.

== pH elution method ==
This is one of most common techniques that are used to remove bounded protein from the ligands. A change in pH alters the charged groups on the ligands and/or the bound protein. This change may directly affect the binding sites and reducing their affinity. On the other hand, a change in pH can cause indirect modification in affinity by altering in conformation of proteins. A sudden decrease in pH is one of the most common methods to elute bounded proteins. The chemical stability of the ligand and target proteins determines the limitation of pH change. The column should always return to neutral pH immediately after the elution to avoid irreversible denature of proteins.

== Ionic strength changing method ==
Changing ionic strength of buffer solution will alter the specific interaction between the ligand and target protein. This method is a mild elution using a buffer with increased ionic strength usually sodium chloride,  applied as a linear gradient or in steps. 

== Competitive agents elution ==
Selective eluents are often utilized to separate substances on a specific medium or in the presence of high binding affinity of the ligand/target protein interaction. The eluting agent competes either for binding to the target protein or for binding to the ligand. This is an example of competitive inhibitors that occur in nature. Substances may be eluted either by a concentration gradient of a single eluent.
In this method, the concentration of competitive agents should be added equally to the concentration of the coupled ligand. However, if the free competing compound binds more weakly than the ligand to the target protein, use a higher concentration of competitive agent to achieve efficiency in elution.

For example of competitive affinity chromatography, There is R1a protein. The target R1a protein bind to cAMP resin. The interaction between R1a protein and cAMP would separate by using cGMP elution buffer. This cGMP compete with target protein, however the elution buffer which contains high concentration of cGMP would bind to resin more. The separated R1a protein will eluted out.
[[File:CAMP.svg|thumb|cAMP]]

==Reduced polarity of eluent==
Conditions are used to lower the polarity of the eluent promote elution without inactivating the proteins. Dioxane or ethylene glycol are typical of this type of eluent.

==Chaotropic eluents==
In case of other elution methods fail, deforming buffer solution, which alters the structure of proteins, can be used to achieve separation of ligand and target proteins. Typical chaotropic agents are guanidine hydrochloride and urea. Although this method will yield the highest percentage of recovery, chaotropes method should be avoided whenever possible since they are to denature the eluted protein.
[[File:Harnstoff.svg|thumb|Urea]]
[[File:Guanidinium chloride V.2.svg|thumb|Guanidinium chloride]]

==Histidine tag==
Affinity chromatography can be performed using a number of different protein tags. One of the common tag using in laboratory is poly-hisitidine. Its shortness in length prevents altering the conformation of the tagged protein. Histidine tagging is favorable because it is very specific, allowing for a high level of purification. 

The gene which encodes for a specific protein is first modified to include the tag. A string of histidine residues may be added to the amino or carboxyl terminus of the expressed protein. The tagged proteins are then passed through a column of beads containing covalently attached, immobilized nickel(II) (Ni 2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.) This His-tag binds tightly to the immobilized metal ions because the side chain of Histidine, imidazole, has a specific binding affinity to metal ions (in this case, nickel II). As a result, the desired protein is binded tightly to the beads while other proteins flow through the column easily. Even other, non-desired proteins, that have Histidine side chains will flow through because they do not have as many as the desired, tagged protein, which would have about 6 adjacent Histidine residues. The protein can then be eluted from the column by addition of imidazole or some other chemicals that bind to the metal ions and displace the proteins. The presence of desired proteins can be verified through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

[[Image:Histag.jpg|450px]]
[[Image:L-Histidin - L-Histidine.svg|thumb|Histidine]]

'''Nickel resin regeneration'''

In recombinant DNA, histidine tag on the desired protein and Nickel resin are commonly used to purify desired protein via affinity chromatography. That is, histidine has strong affinity towards the nickel resin which does not flow through the column. Undesired proteins do not have the designed histidine sequences hence could not bind to Nickel resin; those protein flow though the column. During elution, we add a relatively high concentration of imidazole buffer. Imidazole compete with our desired protein to bind with the nickel resin. 
In practice, Nickel resin is rather expensive. Regeneration of Nickel resin is essential. It involves several steps. First, there are possible left over protein remained on used Nickel resin; these left over protein are denatured and washed away using Guanidinium chloride and corresponding buffer. The Nickel resin is washed with Milli Q water and increasing concentration of Ethanol. One essential step in Nickel resin regeneration is recharging the Nickel. We first remove the Nickel with EDTA, which is a hexa-dendate compound that releases the Nickel ion. The Resin would then turn white without Nickel. Then the resin is recharged with high concentration of nickel salt to obtain our slightly green resin.

[[File:Nickel-resin regeneration.jpg|thumb|Add caption here]]

==  Glutathione S-transferase (GST) tags ==
GST has an affinity for glutathione, which is available immobilized as glutathione agarose. An excess amount of gluthione is used to displace the tagged protein for elution. Together with the histidine tags, the [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification|purification]] of recombinant proteins like GST tags is the most common use of affinity chromatography.
[[File:Glutathion.svg|thumb|Glutathione]]

GST are enzymes involving cellular defense against electrophillic compounds. It has hing affinity and specificity to bind with glutathinone. The strength and selectivity of this interaction allow GST tagged proteins to be purified by the glutathione-based protein resins. The glutathione resins selectively bind to GST-tagged proteins effectively, allowing the specific protein of interest be separated from the mixture at high efficiency. 

GST is a 35-KDa protein, it has small peptides. It is this characteristic which allows one to perform GST-protein purification quickly without degradation by proteases and minimize sample loss.GST will lose its ability to bind Glutathione resin when it is denatured, therefore, strong denaturant such as Guanidine-HCl and urea cannot be added in the buffers.

== Lectin Affinity Chromatography ==
Lectin protein, for example concanavalin A which is originally extracted from the jack-bean Canavalia ensiformis, binds specifically to some certain structures in sugars. Lectin affinity chromatography is one kind of affinity chromatography in which the plant protein concanavalin A is purified by passing a crude extract through a column of beads containing covalently attached glucose residues. Since it has affinity to glucose, concanavalin A will bind to this type of column. A concentrated solution of glucose is then added to remove the bound concanavalin A from the column.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
=== Advantages ===
•  Affinity chromatography is a fairly achievable technique because of the great selectivity of the glucose residues and the target protein, giving purified product with a high yield of recovery.

1•  It can be a one step process in many cases.

2•  The technique can be used for substances of low concentration. 

3•  Rapid separation is achieved while avoiding contamination.

4. Unlike Gel filtration chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography would be able to isolate one specific protein at a time, where other techniques will isolate proteins with similar characteristics.

=== Disadvantages ===

•  The interaction of proteins of interest and ligand has to be determined carefully. This process required expensive materials, time, and small amount of protein that can be processed at once.

&lt;b&gt;Protein Purification &lt;/b&gt; is the process of separating proteins for individual analysis. Protein purification is the second step of studying proteins, the first being the process of an assay. An assay is a procedure to measure the activity enzyme activity thus confirming the presence of the protein or proteins in interest. Popular assays include [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Western Blotting|Western Blotting]] and [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Enzyme-Linked Immunoabsorbent Assay (ELISA)|ELISA]](Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Before the purification process, [[/Cell Disruption|Cell Disruption]] is utilized to homogenize the cell's content.  After the cell has been opened up, the process of purifying proteins from one another and the other [[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles|organelles]] can be approached in several different methods.  Protein mixtures are normally separated multiple times, each based on a different property, such as: 
* Solubility
* Size
* Molecular Weight
* Charge
* Binding affinity 

The intended reason for purifying a specific protein governs the level and degree of protein purification. At times, a sample of protein that is only moderately purified suffices for its intended application; however, other situations require a higher degree of purification, especially if the fundamental ambition is to study the characteristics and tendencies of the specific protein in interest. By considering solubility, size, molecular weight, charge, and binding affinity, the goal of the scientist that conducts protein purification is to find a level of purification necessary and create a protein yield that is ample for further research and application. This means using the fewest amount of steps in order to keep the yield high, as each protein purification step incurs a degree of product loss. Therefore two factors serve as obstacles in protein purification: yield and purification level. The main goal of each protein purification project falls under two categories: analytical (for studying and research purposes) and preparative (for production and creation of commercial products).

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;20%&quot;&gt;Proteins are separated based on masses or densities by a centrifugal force.  Centrifugation enables the separation of proteins in different cell compartments. &lt;td&gt;Different proteins precipitate at different salt concentration. When the concentration of salt increases, more proteins are able to separate.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Large molecules flow more rapidly to the bottom of the column.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; Proteins are separated according to its charge. Positively charged proteins bind to negatively charge bead, and negatively charge proteins are released. The negatively charged proteins flow through faster.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Many proteins have high affinity for specific chemical groups.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Proteins separate according to different levels of hydrophobicity.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Electrophoresis separate protein while the gel enhances the separation. Small proteins move more rapidly through the gel.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Different proteins have different pI (isoelectric point).&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Proteins are separated horizontally based on pI and vertically based on mass&lt;/td&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Proteins are separated through a semi-permeable membrane. Since the dimensions of proteins are generally larger than the pores of the membrane, proteins do not pass through and separate.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The most popular method to synthesize peptides of more than 50 [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]] in length is automated solid-phase peptide synthesis. R. Bruce Merrifield first developed this method, and it can be used for both [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]] and [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA|RNA]]. To begin the process, the carboxyl-terminal amino acid of the desired sequence is anchored to polystyrene beads, and the peptide is synthesized backwards from the C-terminal end to the N-terminal end (contrary to the usual sequence from the N-terminal end to the C-terminal end). The t-Boc protected group of this amino acid is then removed by a wash with trifluoroacetic acid (CF3COOH) and methylene chloride (CH2Cl2), which does not break [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Covalent bonds|covalent]] bonds. The next amino acid with t-boc (di-tri-butyl dicarbonate), a protected N-terminal, and a DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide)-activated C-terminal is added to the reaction column. After the formation of the [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Important Organic Reactions in Biochemistry/Peptide Bonding|peptide bond]], the excess reagents and dicyclohexylurea are washed away with an appropriate solvent. For the elongation of the peptides, the next amino acids continue to be added in the same manner. At the end of the synthesis, the peptide is released from the polystyrene beads by adding hydrofluoric acid (HF), which cleaves the ester bond without destroying the peptide bonds. Protected groups on the reactive side chains, such as lysine or histamine, also are removed at this time. The huge advantage of this method, besides the fact it is automated, lies in the purification step. Because the impurities are not bound to the reaction column, they can be washed away without losing the synthesized product. In the laboratories, this technique is used to synthesize drugs, such as insulin.

==Processes==
===Transcription===
It starts in the nucleus. It is very similar to the [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]] replication process in which the DNA is &quot;unzipped&quot; by helicase, producing one nucleotide chain ready to be replicated.

Transcription 3 Steps summary –&gt; Producing an RNA message from DNA

(A) Binding and Initiation

DNA transcription unit divided into TATA Box and Enhencer region. TBP is bind to TATA region, other transcription factors (a protein has bound to the region) such as TFIIA and TFIIB are bonded to TATA regions as well. The RNA polymerase cannot bind to the DNA directly unless a transcription factor is bind first. Transcription begins when RNA polymerases bind to the enhancer region( or called the initiation site), separate it into two strands by requiring ATP energy Initiation initiate the location of the DNA strand to begin transcription.

(B) Elongation

RNA polymerase moves along the DNA promoter region by performs two elongate steps:

1)      it untwists (unwind) the double helix DNA about 10 bases at a time at 3.4 A. 

2)      adds nucleotides to the 3’ end of the growing RNA.  

As the RNA polymerase moves along, the growing mRNA molecule was replicated base on base.  Transcription goes about 60 nucleotides per second. DNA’s nucleotides Adenine will be complimentary to RNA’s Uracil base. DNA’s nucleotides Guanine will pair with Cytosine. 

(C) Termination

Transcription proceeds until the RNA polymerase reaches a termination site. No more RNA nucleotides will be added and the mRNA is released. So, mRNA will move out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm for the further use in protein synthesis.

===Translation===
The [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA/Messenger RNA (mRNA)|mRNA]] codons translates to amino acid polypeptide chains in three steps.

3 steps general guidance of translation

Initiation
2.	Small subunits ribosomal attaches to mRNA. Large Subunit of ribosome is bind to small subunit with A site (entry for tRNA.)and P site ( leaving door for tRNA.) first attach to a tRNA. anticodon( nucleotide triplet in tRNA) is attaching to A site (entry site) to paired with 3 nucleotide codons from mRNA. tRNA carries an amino acid. As shown by the graph below, tRNA.  carry an amino acid on the top 

Elongation
3.	Initiator tRNA. then moved to P site and A site is opened for the second triplet coded tRNA. to enter along with another amino acid. After the second tRNA. is bind to A site. The amino acid is then bonded together by peptide bonds. Afterwards the third tRNA comes in right after the second tRNA. move to P site. (Moving along from 3’’ to 5’’) 
4.	ribosomal enzymes link the amino acid into a chain. The process will continue until the stop codon (UAA) is reached. 
 
Termination
 
5.	a stop codon is reached (UAA, UAG, or UGA).  A protein called a release factor binds in the A-site to the termination codon. The ribosomes adds a wtaer molecule to the end of the polypeptide chain.
6.	ribosome dissociates into its component parts

==Advantages==
Good yield and high purity. All reactions are carried out in the single vessel, eliminating losses caused by the repeated transfer of products. This method is good for synthesizing long chain of peptide (50 residues and above).

==Synthetic Peptides==
Peptides can be made synthetically by linking an amino group of one amino acid to the [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Organic Functional Group/Carboxyl|carboxyl]] group of another; this being an example of a condensation reaction. A condensation reaction is the reaction when two molecules come together, releasing water, to form one molecule. 

Peptide synthesis can be specific; meaning specific/desired products can be formed. To make unique products and to prevent side reactions, protecting groups such as tert-butyloxycarbonyl (t-Boc) are used. T-Boc is used in the first step of the formation of simple peptides. This protecting group, in order to block the alpha-amino group, reacts with the alpha-amino group forming a complex [[Image:known as   t-butyloxycarbonyl amino acid. The blocking of the amino group is followed by the activation of the carboxyl group of the same amino acid. The carboxyl group is activated by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC). 

Now, with the alterations being done to the amino group and the [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Organic Functional Group/Carboxyl|carboxyl]] group of the first amino acid, a second amino acid can be linked to the first amino acid. The second amino acid has a free amino group, meaning not blocked, and it links to the activated carboxyl group of the first; forming a rigid peptide bond and releasing dicyclohexylurea. The carboxyl group of the newly formed dipeptide is activated with DCC and ready to react with a third amino acid which has a free amino group. Again, a new peptide bond is formed and dicyclohexylurea is released. This process can be performed continuously until the desired peptide is synthesized. To end the synthesis, dilute acid, which removes the t-Boc and leaves the peptide undisturbed, is added. 

[[Image:tinoDCC.jpg|thumb|Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC)]]

Solid-phase method is used to form synthetic peptides that contain more than 50 amino acids.  It involves binding the last amino acid's carboxyl group to polystyrene beads. The anchored amino acids t-Boc is removed, and the next amino acid with t-Boc protected amino group and DCC activated carboxyl group is added to the amino acid with polystyrene beads. The peptide bond forms, and the peptide with polystyrene beads is filtered and washed, so the peptide is pure before the synthesis is continued. The following amino acids are linked with the same process until the desired peptide is synthesized. Finally, the finished peptide is removed from the beads by using hydrofluoric acid(HF).

Peptide ligation is used to synthesize peptides with more than 100 amino acids. The long peptide is formed from two or more smaller sized peptides with no protecting groups on them. Native thiol ligation is the most powerful and widely used peptide ligation. The long peptide is formed from peptides with thioester on C-terminal carboxyl group and the other peptides with cysteine on N-terminal. The thioester on C-terminal carboxyl group of one peptide reacts with the cysteine on N-terminal of another peptide to form a thioester-linked intermediate. The intermediate is then rearranged(S-&gt;N acyl shift) to form a peptide bond. The small sized unprotected peptides are linked by this process to synthesize the long peptide.

==Utilization==
Synthetic peptides are made for many purposes.  These peptides can act as antigens, which will stimulate the immune system of the body to produce antibodies that target such peptide.  These antibodies can then be used to isolate a protein.  Peptides can also isolate receptors for hormones. 

Synthetic peptides can also be used as drugs. Such example is the synthetic analog of Vasopressin, also known as 1-Desamino-8-D-arginine vassopressin. This synthetic peptide is used to treat patients with diabetes insipidus who lacks the peptide hormone vasopressin, which cause them to urinate excess liquid from their body. By using the analog of vasopressin to substitute for the natural vasopressin, such patients can be treated.

[[Image:vasopressin.jpg]]

Lastly, synthetic peptides can be used to gain a greater understanding of the 3D structure of proteins. Using synthetic proteins to study the 3D structure of proteins is extremely helpful because such peptides can include many amino acids that are not found in normal proteins; meaning these peptides are not limited to just the 20 standard amino acids. This result in a much greater variety of structures.

== Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis ==
Polypeptide synthesis can be automated, known as the Merrifield solid-phase peptide synthesis, which uses a solid support of polystyrene to support a peptide chain. Polystyrene is a polymer whose subunits are derived from ethenylbenzene.

[[Image:Polystyrene linear.svg|thumb|Polystyrene]]

The beads of polystyrene are insoluble and rigid when they are dry; however, they swell in certain organic solvents, dichloromethane for example. Therefore, reagents are able to move in and out of the polymer matrix easily. The phenyl groups on polystyrene are functionalized by electrophilic aromatic substitution.

[[Image:Electrophilic Chloromethylation of Polystyrene.jpg]]

Using a dipeptide as an example, the solid-phase synthesis of peptide on chloromethylated polystyrene proceeds as follows.

1. Attach protected amino acid

2. Deprotect amino terminal

3. Coupling to the second protected amino acid

4. Deprotect amino terminal

5. Disconnect dipeptide from polystyrene

==Purpose of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC)==
Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) is used specifically in peptide synthesis in order to activate the electrophilicity of the carboxylate group. This allows the C-terminus to be more favorable as an attachment site for other amino acids. Then the negatively charged oxygen will act as a nucleophile which attacks the center carbon in DCC. This intermediate will eventually be converted into urea, a stable end product that is relatively unreactive throughout the remaining peptide synthesis process. In addition, DCC's activation ability may sometimes racemize peptide bonds if not monitored correctly, therefore sometimes triazoles may be used instead which do not racemize the stereochemistry of peptides.

[[Image:Solid-Phase Synthesis of Peptide.jpg]]

==Advantage of solid-phase synthesis==
The advantage of solid-phase synthesis is that the products can be isolated easily since all the intermediates are immobilized on polystyrene. Thus, the products can be purified by filtration and washing. Repetition of the deprotection-coupling process will be able to synthesize larger peptides. A machine, designed by Merrifield, is able to carry out the series of manipulations automatically.

==Protecting Groups==
Peptide bond can be formed from the carboxyl group and amino group on the main chains of amino acids. It also can be formed from the side chains to synthesize an undesired peptide. In order to synthesize a desired peptide, protecting groups are used to prevent the formation of undesired products. They also prevent the polymerization from the excess amino acids used in the reaction. Protecting groups also aid in ensuring that the stereochemistry of certain amino acids remain unchanged. Configurations of amino acids may have their stereoisomers changed or racemized if not properly protected as well.

==t-butyloxycarbonyl(t-Boc) protecting group==
It is used to protect the N-terminal amino groups as well as the side chains of lysine, arginine, asparagine, and glutamine. Di-t-butyldicarbonate reacts with the NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of amino acid to form a t-Boc-amino acid. t-Boc group can be removed under acidic condition. Typically, they are treated with strong acid or Trifluoroacetic acid(TFA), CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH. In the lab, Boc-amino acids are also available to buy since it can be synthesized easily in large quantity. People who synthesize peptides do not have to make Boc-amino acid on their own.  Solid phase synthesis is effective because it allows the protein to remain in a primary structured configuration rather than being complicated by secondary or tertiary intermolecular interactions.

[[File:T-boc unprotected.png|thumb|Mechanism of how T-boc is removed from the amino acid using HCl]]
[[Image:TFA.jpg|thumb|Trifluoroacetic acid used to remove t-Boc group]]

==Solution-Phase Peptide Synthesis (Using Benzyloxycarbonyl(Z) as protecting group)==
Benzyloxycarbonyl is used to protect the N-terminal amino groups as well as the side chains of lysine, arginine, asparagine, and glutamine. The synthesis starts at the N-terminus and ends at C-terminus. For example, here are steps to synthesize a simple peptide such as Ala-Val:

First Step: Benzyl choloroformate react with the N-terminus of alanine, forming benzyloxycarbonyl alanine (alanine with the N-ternimus protected by Z-group). Typically, triethylamine is used as catalyst for this reaction. 

Second Step: The protected alanine is treated with ethyl choloroformate. Carboxyl group of the alanine was activated by forming anhydride. It is sensitive to any nucleophilic attack from the N-terminus of Valine.

Third step: Valine is added to the protected, activated alanine. This forms peptide bond, connecting Valine and Alanine. We'll have the product of Z-Ala-Valine. Notice that the N-terminus is still being protected after this step. 

Final Step: The Z-protected group was removed by hydrogenolysis under mild condition with metal such as Pd acting as catalyst. (check the image for detailed reactions in each step)

[[Image:Solution-base-synthesis.jpg|thumb|Synthesis of Ala-Valine, using solution-phase synthesis]]

In order to synthesize a larger protein, we have the repeat the second and third step. Activating the C-terminus and then, coupling the next amino acid. The advantages of this synthesis are it works very fast, and have a good percentage yield of the product. However, it can only be used for  small protein chain. The yields become smaller with larger protein. Therefore, solid-phase is more preferred with large protein. 

 

[[Image:zgroup.jpg|thumb|Z-group protecting group]]

==9Fluoronylmethyoxycarbonyl(Fmoc) protecting group==
It is used to protect the N-terminal amino groups as well as the side chains of lysine, arginine, asparagine, and glutamine. Fmoc can be removed by piperidine/DMF.
[[Image:fmoc.jpg|thumb|220px|Fmoc protecting group]]
[[File:Piperidin.svg|thumb|220px|Piperidine. Used to remove Fmoc group]]

==t-butyl and benzyl protecting groups==
They are used to protect the C-terminal carboxyl groups as well as the side chains of serine, threonine, tyrosine, glutamate, and aspartate. t-butanol or benzenol reacts with the hydroxyl groups or carboxyl groups of amino acids to form t-butyl or benzyl amino acid. t-butyl or benzyl can be removed by strong acid and catalytic hydrogenation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Mass spectrometer schematics.png|thumb|A mass spectrometer schematic]]

Mass spectrometry is an analytical technique used for identifying the mass of a compound based on the mass-to-charge ratio of charged particles. The ratio of charge to mass of the particles is determined by passing them through an applied electric field in a mass spectrometer, which has three main modules: an ion source, a mass analyzer, and a detector. In such procedure, a sample of protein for analysis is placed in the MS instrument. A laser beam is applied to allow the sample to become ionized at the ion source. Positively charged ions of different sizes result and move through the electric field through the analyzer. The lighter ions arrive at the detector first, which triggers a clock to record the time of flight (TOF). This is characteristic of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, which can determine the mass of individual components of large protein complexes. 

Mass spectrometry is used to analyze the ionized forms of molecules in the gas phase. Mass data is obtained by measuring how fast the ion accelerates through an applied electric field and using Newton's third law, F = ma where F is force, m is mass, and a the acceleration, to calculate the mass since the applied force is known and the acceleration is the experimentally measured value. 

Modern techniques for protein analysis include Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization (MALDI) and Electrospray Ionization (ESI). Advances to this technique has now made it possible to determine protein masses with an accuracy of one mass unit or less in most cases.

== Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization (MALDI) ==
The protein or peptide is co-precipitated with an organic compound that absorbs laser light in the matrix. The laser light causes the molecules to expel from the surface and capture electrons as it exits the matrix, leaving the molecules as negatively charged ions.  This ionization is very necessary because only ions can be accurately measured.  The ionizing laser pulse triggers a clock that measures the time of flight (TOF) for the ions.  In time of flight (TOF) analysis, the ions are accelerated through the flight tube in an electric field toward the detector.  The lighter ions will arrive first.  One of the biggest benefits in using MALDI, as opposed to molecule ionization methods is that MALDI can give molecular fragments, which accurately represent the molecular mass of a protein or peptide.  In general weights ranging from a few thousand to several hundred thousand Daltons can be measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook | last = Skoog, Holler, Crouch | year = 2007 | title = Principles of Instrumental Analysis | edition = 6th | publisher = Thomson Brooks/Cole | id = 978-0-495-01201-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== '''Electrospray Ionization (ESI)'''  ==

[[Image:Fenn ESI Instrument.jpg|thumb|An ESI machine]]

Electrospray Ionization is an ionization technique used for tiny amounts of large molecules such as polymers and proteins, and peptides. The apparatus usually utilizes a hollow metal tube with a sharply pointed end that faces in front of a plate. During the procedure, a sample solution is sprayed, as if from a syringe, from the metal tube, into a strong electric field with the assistance of warm nitrogen for dissovling. The solutions containing proteins or peptides flow through a fine metallic tip at a nonzero electrical potential which releases the solution as electrically charged droplets containing the protein and solvent that evaporates from the droplet, leaving the protein charged at the plate. A great feature of the ESI spectrum is the ability of the ions to carry multiple charges. This technique is often coupled with mass spectrometry for protein analysis. 

===History of ESI===
The research on mass spectroscopy started long time ago, but it was not until the 20th century when the electospray ionization technique was developed. The ESI was developed by 2002 Chemistry Nobel Prize winner, Dr. John B Fenn. Together with two other scientists, Tanaka Koichi and Kurt Wuthrich, Dr. Fenn focused the research in the field of mass spectrometry. especially on the ESI technique. Dr. Fenn's research discovery was quickly put into practical use. The ESI brought many benefits during the different usages. For instance, it increased the speed with which complex new pharmaceutical compounds could be evaluated. With this usage, it led to the development of AIDS medications in the mid 1990s.

===Properties that make ESI a method of choice for biological applications===
1. The phage conversion process is &quot;soft&quot;--meaning that it can handle very fragile molecules to be ionized. Furthermore, in some cases, even noncovalent interactions can be put through Mass Spectroscopy.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Allows for the analysis of complex mixtures because the eluting fractions can be directly sprayed into the MS&lt;br /&gt;
3. Produces natural ions, allowing for the measurement of high-mass biopolymers

[[File:LDESI.svg|thumb|LDESI]]

===ESI Instruments===
====Quattro II====
One of the three instruments used for electrospray ionization, Quattro II is the primary instrument used for LR ESI. This instrument is a quadrupole-hexapole-quadrupole mass spectrometer. It has a mass to change rate of 4,000 Da and equipped with an ESI source. During the procedure, samples are inserted into the Quattro II by loop injection or direct infusion through a syringe pump. 

====LCQ====
The LCQ instrument is also known as the LCQ Deca XP. This is also an electrospray ionization or ion trap mass spectrometer. It is equipped with the X calibur software that allows acquisition of photodiode array data and mass spectral data. This equipment has a great advantage compared to the other instruments, and it is the capability to perform multiple stages of mass spectrometry. The ability to do this allows an increase in the amount of structural information obtainable for a given molecule. The injection techniques of the LCQ is similar to that of the Quattro, but in slight variations. The LCQ can also be introduced by flow injection using an LC pump or injection valve. Another way is by the LC fitted with a colume. While the Quattro II is the primary instrument for LR ESI, LCQ is the primary instrument for LC/MS and LC/MSMS in ESI. 

====Q-Tof====
The Q-Tof is a hybrid quadrupole mass spectrometer with MS/MS capability. Compared to the other two instrument, Q-Tof has a very high resolution, sensitivity, and mass accuracy. With these properties, the Q-Tof is able to assist the mass measurement accuracy for peptides. At the mean time, it can also improved the charge state identification of multiply charged ions and greater differentiation of isobaric species. This instrument can also be equipped with different source. For example, when it is equipped with a nanospray source, it can help to analyze small samples and identify the proteins through semi or complete de novo sequencing. Just like Quattro II and LCQ, Q-Tof can be used by injecting samples through an infusion pump, loop injection, or even an HPLC column. Different from the other two instrument, the Q-Tof is the primary instrument for HR ESI.

===New Applications of ESI for Mass Spectrometry===
Mass spectrometry is an analytical technique used to investigate protein complexes. Recent developments of electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) have allows characterization of previously unavailable protein complexes, especially those in the gas phase. ESI-MS allows the study of the kinetics of protein complex assembly. Intermediates can be isolated as well as identified using this method. Furthermore, tandem mass spectrometry is used to determine the building blocks that form the global structure of protein complexes. Moreover, ESI-MS is used to identify equilibrium constants by comparing the relative intensity of the complex to the intensity of the subunits. Finally, ion mobility spectrometry mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) is used to analyze macromolecular assemblies. It gives information on the size, shape, mass-to-charge ratio, and number of subunits. This allows the identification of protein rings and protein complex dissociation.

===Tandem Mass Spectrometry===
[[File:MS MS.png|thumb|MS MS]]
Individual spectrometer elements or a single mass spectrometer are used in multiple stages of mass analysis separation corresponding to MS steps separated in space or time. In tandem mass spectrometry in space, individual spectrometer elements are separated physically, and these elements can be transmission quadrupole, sectors, or time-of-flight. While in tandem mass spectrometer in time, the separation step is done with multiple steps occurring over a range of time and with the ions trapped in the same place, or space. A quadruple ion trap or FTMS instrument can be applied to such analysis, as it performs analysis on a multiple scale. It is often known as MSn. n refers to the number of steps, hence MS3 refers to a separation composed of three steps.

== Approaches for the Analysis of Proteins ==
There are two main ways for the mass spectroscopy analysis of proteins: the bottom-up approach and the top-down approach. In the bottom-up approach, an enzyme, such as trypsin, will be put together with proteins of interest for digestion. The &quot;tryptic peptides&quot; formed as a result of the digestion process are then analyzed by MS and tandem MS. On the other hand with the top-down approach, a protein molecule is analyzed by MS without prior digestion by enzymes. The bottom-up approach is more widely used for several advantages over the top-down approach:

1. Smaller protein ions are more uniform and easy to handle than a whole protein molecule;

2. Masses of smaller protein ions can be determined with higher accuracy;

3. During MS, smaller pieces of proteins are more readily to be reduced into fragments.

However, the one main disadvantage of this approach is the incomplete coverage of the protein molecule. The top-down approach appears to own this advantage while having a lot of other problems, including:

1. The difficulty in handling large protein molecules;

2. Issues about heterogeneity through a whole protein molecule;

3. The complex nature of MS.

Therefore, the top-down analyzes are limited to be applied to only low-throughput single-protein studies. To improve the results of such methods, scientists have come out with an intermediate &quot;middle-down&quot; approach for analyzing proteins that are larger than the smaller protein fragments, such as tryptic pedtides. Although this method is still in development, it is beginning to prove effective, as can be seen in the analysis of modifications on histone tails.&lt;ref&gt;Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011. 80:239-46 ''The Annual Review of Biochemistry'' is online at biochem.annualreviews.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application of MALDI-TOF MS(mass spectrometry)  ==
Usually, the characterization and identification of protein is done by SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide 
gel electrophoresis). However, SDS-PAGE cannot identify small amount of protein samples. MALDI-TOF MS has higher sensitivity
and resolution. MALDI-TOF MS can separate protein samples up to 100 kilo Daltons. Therefore, MALDI-TOF MS is used after 
SDS-PAGE for more accuracy.

First, sample protein is separated by two-dimensional gel. Then, specific cleavage like trypsin cut the proteins. These
separated peptides are identified by MALDI-TOF MS. Heavy peptides will slowly move and lighter peptides will move fast due to
Newton's second law; F = ma. As peptides move along the tube, the peptides of different accelerations or velocities takes 
different the amount of time take to reach end of tube. These separated peptides can be analyzed by matching with the computer
simulated database.

MALDI-TOF MS also can be used of DNA Hybridization, analyzing microorganism and sugars that bonds with proteins like 
glycosaminoglycan.

MALDI has many advantageous properties:&lt;br /&gt;
1. Robustness&lt;br /&gt;
2. High Speed&lt;br /&gt;
3. Immunity to contaminants, biochemical buffers, and common additives&lt;ref&gt;Chait, Brian T. &quot;Mass Spectrometry in the Postgenomic Era.&quot; Laboratory for Mass Spectroscopy and Gaseous Ion Chemistry, The Rockefuller University, New York, NY 10021; email: chait@rockefeller.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications of mass spectrometry to lipids and membranes)  ==
|[[File:CellMembraneDrawing.jpg|128px]]||

Lipidomics is an important part of metabalomics is concerned with he detailed depiction and anaylsis of the structure and function of lipids within a living system. Mass spectrometry has played an extremely crucial and significant role in the determination of the structure of lipids.

'''Introduction'''
The ever increasing number of completely sequenced genomes available have given biologists the challenge of connecting gene structure to gene function. This drive for understanding the function of genes has spurred scientists to analyze expression levels of the components the make up biological systems like mRNA and proteins. Metabolomics is the study of the endogenously synthesized intermediates called the metabolome and is thought to represent the final result of gene expression. Endogenously synthesized intermediates (metabolomes) are primarily composed of lipids and fats. Studying these lipids can provide information in determining the relationship between the role of lipids and various diseases like cancer, atherosclerosis, and chronic inflammation. In addition, many lipids have cellular membranes and studying their interactions with membrane associated proteins/enzymes can give information on the development of drugs to inhibit these interactions that diseases have. 

The first mass spectrometer was constructed by Nobel Laureate Sir J.J Thomson and was used to analyze marsh gas. He observed that the mass to charge rations were 16 to 26, which was identified to be positive ions of methane and acetylene, respectively. Ever since mass spectrometry has been extremely important for the study of proteomics and metabolomics.

'''Lipid Definition and Classification'''
The categorization of lipids can be wide ranged.It can include organic compounds like fats, oils, waxes, sterol, and tryglycerides, and are insoluble in water but soluble in nonpolar organic compounds. They can also be defined as oily to touch. However, there are many lipids that are not always bound by these definitions. This has led to the official  classification of 8 categories of lipids. They are fatty acids, glycerolipids, sphingolipids, sterollipids, prenol lipids, saccharolipids, and polyketides.

==Mass Spectrometry in Membrane Protein Analysis==
Analysis of membrane proteins is challenging because of their hydrophobicity, complex post-translational modifications (PTMs) and relatively low abundance, thus they are not accessible by traditional methods such as X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. However, with the recent advancements in technology and methodology (ie. better liquid chromatographic performance), mass spectrometry (MS) accelerates membrane protein analysis in a large degree; specifically towards the determination and understanding of the complete plasma membrane (PM) proteome, membrane protein topology, membrane protein-protein interactions and signaling networks originating at the membrane.

===MS proteomics to determine the complete membrane proteome===
The hydrophobicity and low abundance of membrane proteins, and the intricate post-translational modifications has made the analysis of complete membrane proteome very difficult, especially when using traditional approaches, because it is technically challenging to isolate hydrophobic and insoluble proteins. However, with mass spectrometry, coupling with compatible detergents, better instrumentation (such as Multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT), which helps to facilitate analysis by separating peptides based on their charge and hydrophobicity), and optimized liquid chromatographic performance, the process of identifying thousands of proteins in one single analysis and get a global overview of all the proteins in the membrane can be done easily and more accurately.&lt;br /&gt;


Membrane proteins are generally categorized into three different types:&lt;br /&gt;

1. Integral membrane proteins, which is membrane penetrating, is determined to have a few β-barrels (for example, maltoporin) and a majority in α-helical arrangement (for example, the insulin receptor), which can be further divided into four different types based on terminus of the protein and number of times the protein traverses the membrane. &lt;br /&gt;

2. Peripheral membrane protein is found to be attached to membrane as in-plane α-helix (such as microtubule-affinity-regulating kinase)  or by electrostatic interactions (such as diphtheria toxin).&lt;br /&gt;

3. Lipid- anchored proteins is found to be attached to fatty acid, prenyl group or glycophophatidylinositol anchor by covalent bonding (for example the G proteins).


When dealing with detergent-resistant membrane domains and microdomains, mass spectrometry, coupling with multicomplexed fractionation and 1D and 2D gel-based approaches, can also effectively be used to analyze the protein components of the membrane. Studies have shown that these detergent-resistant membranes contain proteins that account for concentrated function.

===Protein Topology===
Instead of using traditional methods such as X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry can be used to determine the membrane protein structures, folding and topology at submolecular level, in conjunction with one of the following methods:&lt;br /&gt;

'''1. Hydrogen/deuterium (H/D-MS) exchange'''&lt;br /&gt;

This is based on the hydrogen atom exchange between proteins and the surrounding aqueous solution. And the rate of exchange is ruled by the solvent accessibility through the bilayer of the membrane. New findings using this method are that most of the hydrogen bonding interactions in the protein only moderately stabilized the folded state, and that there are several dynamic regions within the β2 adrenergic receptor (G-protein-coupled receptor).


'''2. Oxidative or hydroxyl radical probe mass spectrometry'''&lt;br /&gt;

This has the key advantage, over other approaches, in that hydroxyl radicals can be generated directly in solution and react permanently with minimal modification through the incorporation of a limited number of oxygen atoms at reactive residue side chains. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_footprinting


'''3. Covalent tagging with regents such as carbodiimide diisopropylcarbodiimide (DiPC-MS)'''&lt;br /&gt;

This is also specific in the residues, Asp and Glu. From this method, it was shown that Glu269 serves an important role in substrate binding of the membrane protein lactose permease.

One main advantage of using MS-based topology approaches is that they are not limited by the type and the size of the membrane proteins.

===Membrane protein-protein interactions===
Mass spectrometry is useful to discover exactly which proteins physically and functionally interact, thus further our understanding of the molecular function of the plasma membrane proteins.&lt;br /&gt;

Two approaches are generally used:&lt;br /&gt;

1. Isolate membrane protein complexes by antibody purification: Best for identifying multiprotein complexes&lt;br /&gt;

With this antibody purification approach, more receptors are identified, such as the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR), γ-aminobutyric acid and kainate receptors, in addition to the previously identified N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT2C) receptors.

2. In vitro binding experiments followed by mass spectrometry: Best for finding direct high-affinity interactions such as ligand and receptor pairs

===Signaling Networks Across Membrane===
Plasma membrane is where all the signaling between cells takes place. Many surface receptors, for example, GPCPs, receptor tyrosine kinases, adhesion signaling molecules and channels, are embedded in the plasma membranes. To further understand membrane signaling, mass spectrometry is used to determine the changes in protein abundance or PTM such as phosphorylation, after treated the cell cultures with growth factor – ligand. 

One example of membrane signaling would be the analysis of brassinosteroid (BR) membrane. Arabidopsis thaliana seedling were first treated with BRs. Then the membrane fractions were analyzed using 2D gel and mass spectrometer. The findings showed that membrane-associated kinases of BR transmembrane receptors are responsible for BR membrane signaling. Another example is that the epidermal growth factor signaling of phosphorylated proteins was investigated using MS with the use of stable isotpe labeling and affinity capture. From these studies, thousands of proteins were successfully identified.

== Quantitative Proteomics ==
Quantitative proteomics is becoming a major part of biological research because it allows scientists to track the dynamic changes of proteins, including post-translational modifications and the formation of protein complexes. This technique often plays a large role in generating new insights and hypothesis for biological processes, which can then be validated by other research approaches. Understanding how proteins change and interact leads to greater understanding in cellular processes and disease progression. For example, it is known that histone regulates gene activation and DNA repair by undergoing methylation, acetylation, and other modifications that changes its interaction with DNA and nuclear proteins. Studying the structural changes of histone during transcription would thus be helpful in learning how to deactivate undesirable genes and amplify beneficial genes. Another heavily targeted area of study is the comparison of protein expression, modifications, and interactions between the diseased state proteins versus that of the normal condition. Understanding these differences can offer valuable insights into the mechanics of disease progression and provide guidance for structure-based drug design. Although tracking protein dynamics is difficult due to the complexity of the biochemical pathways and the drastic changes during different cellular states, the use of mass spectroscopy has greatly reduced these challenges.

===Labelling Techniques===
Before peptide tagging was used to study protein dynamics, quantitative proteomics relied on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE). After running 2D-PAGE, the spot intensities from two or more samples were compared and a mass spectroscopic analysis was used to identify and quantify the protein. Modern quantitative proteomics relies on isotope labelling and mass spectrometry. These methods include:

[[Image:Isotope-Coded Affinity Tags (ICAT).jpg|thumb|Procedure for Isotope-Coded Affinity Tags (ICAT)]]

====Isotope-Coded Affinity Tag (ICAT)====
The protein of interest is purified from different cell states and immersed in labelling reagents that has a biotin tag and a linker region with either heavy or light isotopes. These reagents bind to cysteine-containing peptides, creating a labelled peptide. The proteins are then combined and digested, forming labeled and unlabelled peptide fragments. Combining the digestion process reduces variation in the procedure so that experimental error can be minimized. The labeled peptides are first selected through affinity chromatography based on the presence of the biotin marker, then analyzed with mass spectrometer. Proteins labeled with the light isotope show a lower mass to charge ratio. The relative abundance of the proteins can be determined by the ratio of the peak intensities.

====Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino Acids in Cell Culture (SILAC)====
[[File:Silac.gif|thumb|left|Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino Acids in Cell Culture (SILAC)]]
Stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) is a method of ''in vivo'' labeling of proteins for mass spectrometry analysis. The cell culture is grown in a “light” medium and a “heavy” medium. These mediums are given identical conditions except for one particular amino acid that contains a heavy isotope for the “heavy” medium and a light isotope for the “light” medium. Typical isotopes chosen to make the “heavy” medium include &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, and &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N. The cells incorporate the heavy or light isotope amino acids naturally during metabolism. After a few generations, every instance of that amino acid will be replaced by the type of amino acid provided in the medium. The proteins grown in both the mediums are then extracted from the cells, purified, and combined together. The proteins are digested with a protease, separated by high performance liquid chromatography, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. As in ICAT, the relative abundance of the proteins can be determined by the ratio of the peak intensities.

====Isobaric Labeling====
Isobaric labeling is a technique that attaches same mass chemical groups to peptides and then using tandem mass spectrometry to determine the relative abundance of the isobaric tag, which represents the abundance of the respectively tagged peptide. Each isobaric tag is composed of a reporter group and a balance group. A peptide-reactive group is attached to the tag to increase peptide affinity to the tag. In each experiment, many isobaric tags can be used to label proteins. All the reporter groups are made to have different masses by varying the amount of 13C, 15N, 18O in the reporter molecule. The balance group is a carbonyl group that is also of varying masses. The overall mass of the reporter group and the balance group are constant for all of the labels. This is useful as an internal standard for mass spectrometry because all labeled proteins should appear in one peak since all the masses are the same. There are two types of isobaric labeling, both utilizing the method as described above:
* iTRAQ (isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification)
* TMT (Tandem mass tag)

== Hydrogen Exchange Mass Spectrometry ==
Hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry is a contemporary method to study protein dynamics, protein-solvent interactions, and protein complex interactions. This technique takes advantage of the exchanging behavior of amide hydrogen to label the protein with deuterium, which can be detected through mass spectrometry or NMR analysis. This method generates information for protein dynamics by describing the solvent accessibility and level of disorder for the various parts of the protein. 

===Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Reaction===
In solution, the hydrogen covalently bonded to the nitrogen of the peptide (called amide hydrogen) exchanges proton with the solvent. By replacing  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O solvent  with D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, the amide hydrogen can be incorporated into the peptide during the hydrogen exchange process. This is usually accomplished by diluting the protein in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O buffer with the analog D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O buffer tenfold, thus surrounding the protein with mostly D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and lessening its contact with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Hydrogen exchange reaction is significantly affected by temperature and pH. Since the exchange process can be acid or base catalyzed, pH must be monitored carefully during the D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O incubation. To study proteins at the natural state, exchange condition is set at pH 7-8 to mirror the physiological environment of the proteins. At pH 2.6, the exchange reaction occurs the slowest. A standard exchange experiment involves immersing the protein for a set amount of time in the D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O buffer, then rapidly shifting the pH of the solution to 2.6, thus slowing the exchange reaction, a process called quenching. A set of exchanging experiments consist of similar exchanging conditions but each experiment is given varying reaction times, commonly ranging from 10 seconds to 3000 seconds or longer. Exchange reactions occur extremely fast at room temperature. To more accurately characterize the deuteration levels among the proteins samples at each of the time points, exchanges are performed at cold temperatures (around 4&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C) to decrease the rate of exchange.

===Deuterium Detection by Mass Spectrometry===
To analyze the deuterated proteins with mass spectrometry, the proteins are denatured and digested to form peptides. The peptides are separated by HPLC and analyzed by the mass spectrometer. Since the deuterium nucleus is heavier than a hydrogen nucleus because it contains a neutron as well as a proton, the deuterated peptide has a higher mass compared to the non-deuterated peptide. Based on this mass difference, mass spectrometer can accurately distinguish among the peptides with different deuteration levels. The rate of deuteration for each peptide can also be tracked by measuring the masses of identical peptides that are immersed in D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O for different time points.

===Relation to Protein Structure===
Two factors govern exchange behavior for each peptide: solvent accessibility and hydrogen bonding. Peptides buried in the interior of the protein or surrounded by hydrophobic surfaces show less exchange behavior due to the lack of contact with the D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O solvent. Peptides that form the surface of the protein exchange rapidly and completely because they are in constant contact with D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Hydrogen bonding also determines exchange behavior because the hydrogen participating in bonding cannot spontaneously exchange without breaking the bond. Thus great rates of exchange can be attributed to lack of bonding or disorganization. Flexible parts of the protein that are not structured can be characterized by the incorporation of many deuterons. Hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry is also used to study the dynamics of protein complexes to determine which areas of the protein changes in flexibility or solvent accessibility upon binding. This can help identify the areas of the protein that are pertinent to protein-protein interaction and the areas that are dramatically affected by the interaction.

== Mass analyzer designs ==
===Fourier-transform Mass Spectrometry===
Fourier-transform mass spectrometry is a type mass spectrometry that takes advantage of ion-cyclotron resonance to select and detect ions. Fourier-transform MS was invented by Alan G. Marshall and Melvin B. Comisarow at the University of British Columbia in 1974.Fourier-transform MS, also known as Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS has high resolution; therefore, it is used as determining the composition of molecules based on accurate mass. It is also capable of studying large macromolecules such as proteins with multiple charges due to its high resolution.

===Ion-trap Mass Spectrometry===
Ion-trap mass spectrometry exists in both linear and 3-D varieties. IT MS was invented by Wolfgang Paul. It uses constant DC and radio frequency  oscillating AC electric fields to trap ions in a small volume. This 3-D trap consists of a ring electrode separating two hemispherical electrodes. A mass spectrum is obtained by changing the electrode voltages to eject the ions from the trap. Such technique gives its compact size and the ability to trap and accumulate ions to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of a measurement.

===Magnetic-Sector Mass Spectrometry===
Magnetic-sector mass spectrometry uses a static electric or magnetic sector to affect the path and/or velocity or the charged particles. There are two main types of magnetic-sector MS, single focusing analyzers and double focusing analyzers.

===Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry===

Quantum Sniffer(the figure shown on the right) is an ion mobility mass spectrometry developed by Implant Science Corporation. It is a photonic, non radioactive ionization to detect nano particles in an aqueous solution. The molecular weight, shape, and size of the ionized particles would impact the ion mobility as it pass through drift region and reach the detecting point. The detection of the samples are collected by the vortex, ionized photonically, and analyzed via ion mobility spectrometery (IMS). The samples are collected through a vacuum space, then it is pump into the ion source with electrical current in the ion-molecule reaction region. Then, the ion molecule is then further analyzed based on its drift time, the time for it to go from one chamber to another based on its molecular weight. At the end of the result, computer was able to analyzed a resultant graph of detecting particles.

=== Advances in Mass Spectrometry ===

The emergence of advances in studying of structural genomics as well as proteomics can yield more information on soluble proteins and their complexes. 

An example of a new type of mass spectrometry technique is called laser induced liquid bead ion desorption (LILBID). This technique allows can detect membrane proteins by generatingseries of microdroplets of proteins that then get radiated using a laser into an IR range. At lower intensities, complete complexes can be identified whereas at higher intensities, individual subunits can be detected. This new technique can also be thought of as a combination of another type of mass spectrometry often used, MALDI and electrospray. Despite the idea that LILBID could be a combination of these techniques, there are some key similarities and differences between LILBID itself and ES techniques. Both LILBID and Es are able to explain the stoichiometry of intact membrane protein complexes; however ES has the ability to determine small molecule binding that occurs directly within the complexes. In addition, mass spectrometry studies using this ES technique shows that micelles can indeed exist while in the gas phase. Since LILBID has a lower mass resolution compared to ES, it is unable to provide a more precise characterization of the mass differences between the intact complexes.

== Further Improvements Needed for Mass Spectroscopy ==
Although MS technologies have been greatly improved in the last two decades, further improvements are needed for the analysis of protein molecules:

1. Sensitivity of the instrument should be improved in order to analyze smaller number of cells or samples, which allows one to look at corresponding cellular components with their specialized functions;

2. Improved methods are needed to measure low abundance components within protein molecules despite the existence of higher abundance molecules;

3. Higher instrumental speed is needed to allow for deeper and more routine protein analyzes;

4. More robust instruments should be developed to enhance the usage of MS, since some biologists are not quite familiar with these instruments;

5. Improved techniques should be devised to prepare &quot;frozen&quot; samples that are easier to be analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011. 80:239-46 ''The Annual Review of Biochemistry'' is online at biochem.annualreviews.org&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Consonants */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{IPA notice}}

Most of the sounds of Klingon show similarities to those of English; but notable exceptions do exist.  In many cases, the speaker raises the tongue higher or further back; to produce a Klingon ''Q'', for example, the speaker must pull the tongue as far into the back of the mouth as possible.  New speakers may find some of these sounds difficult to produce, especially complex sounds like ''tlh'' and especially in context.  The next section introduces these sounds in context with some tricky Klingon words; you should master these words before continuing on further with the Klingon language.

Klingon was designed to be a harsh, guttural language, sounding very unfamiliar to English speakers. So you might find the sounds strange and difficult to pronounce; e.g. '''Q'''. In Klingon, capital letters are used differently from English; '''I''' is never written ''i'' and '''t''' is never written ''T''. You might think this is pointless; why not write '''I''' as ''i'' and '''H''' as ''h''? After all, there's only one case when a capital letter and a small letter mean different things - '''Q''' and '''q'''. So? you ask. Why not use ''x'' or something for '''Q'''?

You're right, that would be more logical - but Klingon was not designed to be logical, it was designed to be as different from English as possible. Klingon is a language for aliens. What looks more alien, ''tlhingan hol'' or '''tlhIngan Hol'''?

Here are the sounds. If you can't pronounce them all, [[Klingon/Lesson1/Hard Sounds|here's]] a more detailed page describing the sounds not found in English.

=== Consonants ===
For some consonants, the speaker holds the tongue slightly farther back than in English.  As such, the 'd' sounds somewhat heavier, and the 'S' becomes a cross between an English 's' and 'sh'.

The 'H' in Klingon is a raspy English 'h', or like the end sound of the composer Bach, or the Hebrew word l'chaim.  

The 'q' sounds similar to a 'k' in English, but with the tongue positioned farther back in the throat.  

A 'Q' is a very overdone 'q'.  Like a combination of Klingon 'q' and 'H'.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sir Isaac Newton, FRS (pronounced /ˈnjuːtən/; 4 January 1643 – 31 March 1727 [OS: 25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726])[1] was an English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, natural philosopher, alchemist and theologian. His Philosophy Naturals Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, is considered to be the most influential book in the history of science. In this work, Newton described universal gravitation and the three laws of motion, laying the groundwork for classical mechanics, which dominated the scientific view of the physical universe for the next three centuries and is the basis for modern engineering. Newton showed that the motions of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies are governed by the same set of natural laws by demonstrating the consistency between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravitation, thus removing the last doubts about heliocentric and advancing the scientific revolution.

In mechanics, Newton enunciated the principles of conservation of momentum and angular momentum. In optics, he invented the reflecting telescope and developed a theory of colour based on the observation that a prism decomposes white light into a visible spectrum. He also formulated an empirical law of cooling and studied the speed of sound.

In mathematics, Newton shares the credit with Gottfried Leibniz for the development of the differential and integral calculus. He also demonstrated the generalised binomial theorem, developed the so-called &quot;Newton's method&quot; for approximating the zeroes of a function, and contributed to the study of power series.

Newton was also highly religious (though unorthodox), producing more work on Biblical hermeneutics than the natural science he is remembered for today.

In a 2005 poll of the Royal Society asking who had the greater effect on the history of science, Newton was deemed much more influential than Albert Einstein.[5]

===Early years===
Main article: Isaac Newton's early life and achievements
 
Newton in a 1702 portrait by Godfrey KnellerIsaac Newton was born on 4 January 1643 [OS: 25 December 1642][1] at Woolsthorpe Manor in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, a hamlet in the county of Lincoln-shire. At the time of Newton's birth, England had not adopted the latest papal calendar and therefore his date of birth was recorded as Christmas Day, 25 December 1642. Newton was born three months after the death of his father. Born prematurely, he was a small child; his mother Hannah Ayscough reportedly said that he could have fit inside a quart mug. When Newton was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband, the Reverend Barnabas Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough. The young Isaac disliked his stepfather and held some enmity towards his mother for marrying him, as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19: Threatening my father and mother Smith to burn them and the house over them.[6]

According to E.T. Bell and H. Eves:

Newton began his schooling in the village schools and was later sent to The King's School, Grantham, where he became the top student in the school. At King's, he lodged with the local apothecary, William Clarke and eventually became engaged to the apothecary's stepdaughter, Anne Storer, before he went off to the University of Cambridge at the age of 19. As Newton became engrossed in his studies, the romance cooled and Miss Storer married someone else. It is said he kept a warm memory of this love, but Newton had no other recorded &quot;sweet-hearts&quot; and never married.[7]

There are rumors that he remained a confirmed celibate.[8] However, Bell and Eves' sources for this claim, William Stukeley and Mrs. Vincent (the former Miss Storer – actually named Katherine, not Anne), merely say that Newton entertained &quot;a passion&quot; for Storer while he lodged at the Clarke house.

From the age of about twelve until he was seventeen, Newton was educated at The King's School, Grantham (where his signature can still be seen upon a library window sill). He was removed from school, and by October 1659, he was to be found at Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, where his mother, widowed by now for a second time, attempted to make a farmer of him. He was, by later reports of his contemporaries, thoroughly unhappy with the work. It appears to have been Henry Stokes, master at the King's School, who persuaded his mother to send him back to school so that he might complete his education. This he did at the age of eighteen, achieving an admirable final report.

In June 1661, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge. According to John Stillwell, he entered Trinity as a sizar.[9] At that time, the college's teachings were based on those of Aristotle, but Newton preferred to read the more advanced ideas of modern philosophers such as Descartes and astronomers such as Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler. In 1665, he discovered the generalised binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory that would later become infinitesimal calculus. Soon after Newton had obtained his degree in August of 1665, the University closed down as a precaution against the Great Plague. Although he had been undistinguished as a Cambridge student,[10] Newton's private studies at his home in Woolsthorpe over the subsequent two years saw the development of his theories on calculus, optics and the law of gravitation.

===Middle years===
 
Isaac Newton (Bolton, Sarah K. Famous Men of Science. NY: Thomas Y. Crowell &amp; Co., 1889)
Mathematics
Most modern historians believe that Newton and Leibniz had developed infinitesimal calculus independently, using their own unique notations. According to Newton's inner circle, Newton had worked out his method years before Leibniz, yet he published almost nothing about it until 1693, and did not give a full account until 1704. Meanwhile, Leibniz began publishing a full account of his methods in 1684. Moreover, Leibniz's notation and &quot;differential Method&quot; were universally adopted on the Continent, and after 1820 or so, in the British Empire. Whereas Leibniz's notebooks show the advancement of the ideas from early stages until maturity, there is only the end product in Newton's known notes. Newton claimed that he had been reluctant to publish his calculus because he feared being mocked for it. Newton had a very close relationship with Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, who from the beginning was impressed by Newton's gravitational theory. In 1691 Duillier planned to prepare a new version of Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, but never finished it. However, in 1694 the relationship between the two men changed. At the time, Duillier had also exchanged several letters with Leibniz.

Starting in 1699, other members of the Royal Society (of which Newton was a member) accused Leibniz of plagiarism, and the dispute broke out in full force in 1711. Newton's Royal Society proclaimed in a study that it was Newton who was the true discoverer and labeled Leibniz a fraud. This study was cast into doubt when it was later found that Newton himself wrote the study's concluding remarks on Leibniz. Thus began the bitter Newton v. Leibniz calculus controversy, which marred the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the latter's death in 1716.

Newton is generally credited with the generalised binomial theorem, valid for any exponent. He discovered Newton's identities, Newton's method, classified cubic plane curves (polynomials of degree three in two variables), made substantial contributions to the theory of finite differences, and was the first to use fractional indices and to employ coordinate geometry to derive solutions to Diophantine equations. He approximated partial sums of the harmonic series by logarithms (a precursor to Euler's summation formula), and was the first to use power series with confidence and to revert power series. He also discovered a new formula for calculating pi.

He was elected Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in 1669. In that day, any fellow of Cambridge or Oxford had to be an ordained Anglican priest. However, the terms of the Lucasian professorship required that the holder not be active in the church (presumably so as to have more time for science). Newton argued that this should exempt him from the ordination requirement, and Charles II, whose permission was needed, accepted this argument. Thus a conflict between Newton's religious views and Anglican orthodoxy was averted.

===Optics===
From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics. During this period he investigated the refraction of light, demonstrating that a prism could decompose white light into a spectrum of colours, and that a lens and a second prism could recompose the multicoloured spectrum into white light.

A replica of Newton's 6-inch (150 mm) reflecting telescope of 1672 for the Royal SocietyHe also showed that the coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects. Newton noted that regardless of whether it was reflected or scattered or transmitted, it stayed the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour.

From this work he concluded that any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours, and invented a reflecting telescope (today known as a Newtonian telescope) to bypass that problem. By grinding his own mirrors, using Newton's rings to judge the quality of the optics for his telescopes, he was able to produce a superior instrument to the refracting telescope, due primarily to the wider diameter of the mirror. In 1671 the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes On Colour, which he later expanded into his Opticks. When Robert Hooke criticised some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. The two men remained enemies until Hooke's death.

Newton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles, which were refracted by accelerating toward the denser medium, but he had to associate them with waves to explain the diffraction of light (Opticks Bk. II, Props. XII-L). Later physicists instead favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for diffraction. Today's quantum mechanics, photons and the idea of wave–particle duality bear only a minor resemblance to Newton's understanding of light.

In his Hypothesis of Light of 1675, Newton posited the existence of the ether to transmit forces between particles. The contact with the theosophist Henry More, revived his interest in alchemy. He replaced the ether with occult forces based on Hermetic ideas of attraction and repulsion between particles. John Maynard Keynes, who acquired many of Newton's writings on alchemy, stated that &quot;Newton was not the first of the age of reason: he was the last of the magicians.&quot;[11] Newton's interest in alchemy cannot be isolated from his contributions to science.[12] (This was at a time when there was no clear distinction between alchemy and science.) Had he not relied on the occult idea of action at a distance, across a vacuum, he might not have developed his theory of gravity. (See also Isaac Newton's occult studies.)

In 1704 Newton published Opticks, in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light. He considered light to be made up of extremely subtle corpuscles, that ordinary matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation &quot;Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another, ...and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Composition?&quot;[13] Newton also constructed a primitive form of a frictional electrostatic generator, using a glass globe (Optics, 8th Query).

===Mechanics and gravitation===
 
Newton's own copy of his Principia, with hand-written corrections for the second editionFurther information: Writing of Principia Mathematica 
In 1677, Newton returned to his work on mechanics, i.e., gravitation and its effect on the orbits of planets, with reference to Kepler's laws of planetary motion, and consulting with Hooke and Flamsteed on the subject. He published his results in De motu corporum in gyrum (1684). This contained the beginnings of the laws of motion that would inform the Principia.

The Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (now known as the Principia) was published on 5 July 1687 with encouragement and financial help from Edmond Halley. In this work Newton stated the three universal laws of motion that were not to be improved upon for more than two hundred years. He used the Latin word gravitas (weight) for the effect that would become known as gravity, and defined the law of universal gravitation. In the same work he presented the first analytical determination, based on Boyle's law, of the speed of sound in air. Newton's postulate of an invisible force able to act over vast distances led to him being criticised for introducing &quot;occult agencies&quot; into science.[14]

With the Principia, Newton became internationally recognised. He acquired a circle of admirers, including the Swiss-born mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, with whom he formed an intense relationship that lasted until 1693. The end of this friendship led Newton to a nervous breakdown.[clarify][citation needed]

===Later life===
Main article: Isaac Newton's later life
 
Isaac Newton in old age in 1712. Portrait by Sir James Thornhill.In the 1690s, Newton wrote a number of religious tracts dealing with the literal interpretation of the Bible. Henry More's belief in the universe and rejection of Cartesian dualism may have influenced Newton's religious ideas. A manuscript he sent to John Locke in which he disputed the existence of the Trinity was never published. Later works – The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended (1728) and Observations Upon the Prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John (1733) – were published after his death. He also devoted a great deal of time to alchemy (see above).

Newton was also a member of the Parliament of England from 1689 to 1690 and in 1701, but his only recorded comments were to complain about a cold draft in the chamber and request that the window be closed.

Newton moved to London to take up the post of warden of the Royal Mint in 1696, a position that he had obtained through the patronage of Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax, then Chancellor of the Exchequer. He took charge of England's great recoining, somewhat treading on the toes of Master Lucas (and securing the job of deputy comptroller of the temporary Chester branch for Edmond Halley). Newton became perhaps the best-known Master of the Mint upon Lucas' death in 1699, a position Newton held until his death. These appointments were intended as sinecures, but Newton took them seriously, retiring from his Cambridge duties in 1701, and exercising his power to reform the currency and punish clippers and counterfeiters. As Master of the Mint in 1717 Newton unofficially moved the Pound Sterling from the silver standard to the gold standard by creating a relationship between gold coins and the silver penny in the &quot;Law of Queen Anne&quot;; these were all great reforms at the time, adding considerably to the wealth and stability of England. It was his work at the Mint, rather than his earlier contributions to science, that earned him a knighthood from Queen Anne in 1705.
 
Newton's grave in Westminster AbbeyNewton was made President of the Royal Society in 1703 and an associate of the French Académie des Sciences. In his position at the Royal Society, Newton made an enemy of John Flamsteed, the Astronomer Royal, by prematurely publishing Flamsteed's star catalogue, which Newton had used in his studies.

Newton died in London on 31 March 1727 [OS: 20 March 1726][1], and was buried in Westminster Abbey. His half-niece, Catherine Barton Conduitt,[15] served as his hostess in social affairs at his house on Jermyn Street in London; he was her &quot;very loving Uncle,&quot;[16] according to his letter to her when she was recovering from smallpox. Although Newton, who had no children, had divested much of his estate onto relatives in his last years, he actually died intestate.

After his death, Newton's body was discovered to have had massive amounts of mercury in it, probably resulting from his alchemical pursuits. Mercury poisoning could explain Newton's eccentricity in late life.[17]

==Religious views==
Main article: Isaac Newton's religious views
Historian Stephen D. Snobelen says of Newton, &quot;Isaac Newton was a heretic. But like Nicodemus, the secret disciple of Jesus, he never made a public declaration of his private faith - which the orthodox would have deemed extremely radical. He hid his faith so well that scholars are still unravelling his personal beliefs.&quot;[18] Snobelen concludes that Newton was at least a Socinian sympathiser (he owned and had thoroughly read at least eight Socinian books), possibly an Arian and almost certainly an antitrinitarian.[18] In an age notable for its religious intolerance there are few public expressions of Newton's radical views, most notably his refusal to take holy orders and his refusal, on his death bed, to take the sacrament when it was offered to him.[18]

In a view disputed by Snobelen,[18] T.C. Pfizenmaier argues that Newton held the Eastern Orthodox view of the Trinity rather than the Western one held by Roman Catholics, Anglicans, and most Protestants.[19] In his own day, he was also accused of being a Rosicrucian (as were many in the Royal Society and in the court of Charles II).[20]

Although the laws of motion and universal gravitation became Newton's best-known discoveries, he warned against using them to view the universe as a mere machine, as if akin to a great clock. He said, &quot;Gravity explains the motions of the planets, but it cannot explain who set the planets in motion. God governs all things and knows all that is or can be done.&quot;[21]

His scientific fame notwithstanding, Newton's studies of the Bible and of the early Church Fathers were also noteworthy. Newton wrote works on textual criticism, most notably An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture. He also placed the crucifixion of Jesus Christ at 3 April, AD 33, which agrees with one traditionally accepted date.[22] He also attempted, unsuccessfully, to find hidden messages within the Bible.

In his own lifetime, Newton wrote more on religion than he did on natural science. He believed in a rationally immanent world, but he rejected the hylozoism implicit in Leibniz and Baruch Spinoza. Thus, the ordered and dynamically informed universe could be understood, and must be understood, by an active reason, but this universe, to be perfect and ordained, had to be regular.

===Newton's effect on religious thought===
 
&quot;Newton,&quot; by William Blake; here, Newton is depicted as a &quot;divine geometer&quot;Newton and Robert Boyle’s mechanical philosophy was promoted by rationalist pamphleteers as a viable alternative to the pantheists and enthusiasts, and was accepted hesitantly by orthodox preachers as well as dissident preachers like the latitudinarians.[23] Thus, the clarity and simplicity of science was seen as a way to combat the emotional and metaphysical superlatives of both superstitious enthusiasm and the threat of atheism,[24] and, at the same time, the second wave of English deists used Newton's discoveries to demonstrate the possibility of a &quot;Natural Religion.&quot;

The attacks made against pre-Enlightenment &quot;magical thinking,&quot; and the mystical elements of Christianity, were given their foundation with Boyle’s mechanical conception of the universe. Newton gave Boyle’s ideas their completion through mathematical proofs and, perhaps more importantly, was very successful in popularising them.[25] Newton refashioned the world governed by an interventionist God into a world crafted by a God that designs along rational and universal principles.[26] These principles were available for all people to discover, allowed people to pursue their own aims fruitfully in this life, not the next, and to perfect themselves with their own rational powers.[27]

Newton saw God as the master creator whose existence could not be denied in the face of the grandeur of all creation.[28][29][30] But the unforeseen theological consequence of his conception of God, as Leibniz pointed out, was that God was now entirely removed from the world’s affairs, since the need for intervention would only evidence some imperfection in God’s creation, something impossible for a perfect and omnipotent creator.[31] Leibniz's theodicy cleared God from the responsibility for &quot;l'origine du mal&quot; by making God removed from participation in his creation. The understanding of the world was now brought down to the level of simple human reason, and humans, as Odo Marquard argued, became responsible for the correction and elimination of evil.[32]

On the other hand, latitudinarian and Newtonian ideas taken too far resulted in the millenarians, a religious faction dedicated to the concept of a mechanical universe, but finding in it the same enthusiasm and mysticism that the Enlightenment had fought so hard to extinguish.[33]

===Views of the end of the world===
See also: Isaac Newton's occult studies 
See also: Eschatology 
In a manuscript he wrote in 1704 in which he describes his attempts to extract scientific information from the Bible, he estimated that the world would end no earlier than 2060. In predicting this he said, &quot;This I mention not to assert when the time of the end shall be, but to put a stop to the rash conjectures of fanciful men who are frequently predicting the time of the end, and by doing so bring the sacred prophesies into discredit as often as their predictions fail.&quot;[34]

==Newton and the counterfeiters==
As warden of the Royal Mint, Newton estimated that 20% of the coins taken in during The Great Recoinage were counterfeit. Counterfeiting was high treason, punishable by being hanged, drawn and quartered. Despite this, convictions of the most flagrant criminals could be extremely difficult to achieve; however, Newton proved to be equal to the task.

Disguised as an habitué of bars and taverns, he gathered much of that evidence himself. For all the barriers placed to prosecution, and separating the branches of government, English law still had ancient and formidable customs of authority. Newton was made a justice of the peace and between June 1698 and Christmas 1699 conducted some 200 cross-examinations of witnesses, informers and suspects. Newton won his convictions and in February 1699, he had ten prisoners waiting to be executed.

Possibly Newton's greatest triumph as the king's attorney was against William Chaloner. One of Chaloner's schemes was to set up phony conspiracies of Catholics and then turn in the hapless conspirators whom he entrapped. Chaloner made himself rich enough to posture as a gentleman. Petitioning Parliament, Chaloner accused the Mint of providing tools to counterfeiters (a charge also made by others). He proposed that he be allowed to inspect the Mint's processes in order to improve them. He petitioned Parliament to adopt his plans for a coinage that could not be counterfeited, while at the same time striking false coins. Newton was outraged, and went about the work to uncover anything about Chaloner. During his studies, he found that Chaloner was engaged in counterfeiting. He immediately put Chaloner on trial, but Chaloner had friends in high places and, to Newton's horror, Chaloner walked free. Newton put him on trial a second time with conclusive evidence. Chaloner was convicted of high treason and hanged, drawn and quartered on 23 March 1699 at Tyburn gallows.[35]

==Enlightenment philosophers==
Enlightenment philosophers chose a short history of scientific predecessors—Galileo, Boyle, and Newton principally—as the guides and guarantors of their applications of the singular concept of Nature and Natural Law to every physical and social field of the day. In this respect, the lessons of history and the social structures built upon it could be discarded.[36]

It was Newton’s conception of the universe based upon Natural and rationally understandable laws that became the seed for Enlightenment ideology. Locke and Voltaire applied concepts of Natural Law to political systems advocating intrinsic rights; the physiocrats and Adam Smith applied Natural conceptions of psychology and self-interest to economic systems and the sociologists criticised the current social order for trying to fit history into Natural models of progress. Monboddo and Samuel Clarke resisted elements of Newton's work, but eventually rationalised it to conform with their strong religious views of nature.

==Laws of motion==
Main article: Newton's laws of motion
The famous three laws of motion:

Newton's First Law (also known as the Law of Inertia) states that an object at rest tends to stay at rest and that an object in uniform motion tends to stay in uniform motion unless acted upon by a net external force.

Newton's Second Law states that an applied force, &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}&lt;/math&gt;, on an object equals the rate of change of its momentum, &lt;math&gt;\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt;, with time. Mathematically, this is expressed as
 
Because this relation only holds when the mass is constant, that is, when , the first term vanishes, and the equation can be written in the iconic form

where
 
This equation states that a force  applied to an object of mass m causes it to accelerate at a rate .

This equality requires a consistent set of units for measuring mass, length, and time. One such set is the SI system, where mass is in kilograms, length in metres, and time in seconds. This leads to force being in newtons, named in his honour, and acceleration in metres per second per second. The English analogous system is slugs, feet, and seconds.

Newton's Third Law states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that any force exerted onto an object has a counterpart force that is exerted in the opposite direction back onto the first object. The most common example is of two ice skaters pushing against each other and sliding apart in opposite directions. Another example is the recoil of a firearm, in which the force propelling the bullet is exerted equally back onto the gun and is felt by the shooter. Since the objects in question do not necessarily have the same mass, the resulting acceleration of the two objects can be different (as in the case of firearm recoil).

==Newton's apple==

Reputed descendants of Newton's apple tree, at the Botanic Gardens in Cambridge and the Instituto Balseiro library garden“ When Newton saw an apple fall, he found

In that slight startle from his contemplation –
'Tis said (for I'll not answer above ground
For any sage's creed or calculation) –
A mode of proving that the earth turn'd round
In a most natural whirl, called &quot;gravitation;&quot;
And this is the sole mortal who could grapple,
Since Adam, with a fall or with an apple.[37]
 ” 

A popular story claims that Newton was inspired to formulate his theory of universal gravitation by the fall of an apple from a tree. Cartoons have gone further to suggest the apple actually hit Newton's head, and that its impact somehow made him aware of the force of gravity. John Conduitt, Newton's assistant at the Royal Mint and husband of Newton's niece, described the event when he wrote about Newton's life:

“ In the year 1666 he retired again from Cambridge to his mother in Lincolnshire. Whilst he was pensively meandering in a garden it came into his thought that the power of gravity (which brought an apple from a tree to the ground) was not limited to a certain distance from earth, but that this power must extend much further than was usually thought. Why not as high as the Moon said he to himself &amp; if so, that must influence her motion &amp; perhaps retain her in her orbit, whereupon he fell a calculating what would be the effect of that supposition.[38] ” 

The question was not whether gravity existed, but whether it extended so far from Earth that it could also be the force holding the moon to its orbit. Newton showed that if the force decreased as the inverse square of the distance, one could indeed calculate the Moon's orbital period, and get good agreement. He guessed the same force was responsible for other orbital motions, and hence named it &quot;universal gravitation&quot;.

A contemporary writer, William Stukeley, recorded in his Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton's Life a conversation with Newton in Kensington on 15 April 1726, in which Newton recalled &quot;when formerly, the notion of gravitation came into his mind. It was occasioned by the fall of an apple, as he sat in contemplative mood. Why should that apple always descend perpendicularly to the ground, thought he to himself. Why should it not go sideways or upwards, but constantly to the earth's centre.&quot; In similar terms, Voltaire wrote in his Essay on Epic Poetry (1727), &quot;Sir Isaac Newton walking in his gardens, had the first thought of his system of gravitation, upon seeing an apple falling from a tree.&quot; These accounts are probably exaggerations of Newton's own tale about sitting by a window in his home (Woolsthorpe Manor) and watching an apple fall from a tree.

Various trees are claimed to be &quot;the&quot; apple tree which Newton describes. The King's School, Grantham, claims that the tree was purchased by the school, uprooted and transported to the headmaster's garden some years later, the staff of the [now] National Trust-owned Woolsthorpe Manor dispute this, and claim that a tree present in their gardens is the one described by Newton. A descendant of the original tree can be seen growing outside the main gate of Trinity College, Cambridge, below the room Newton lived in when he studied there. The National Fruit Collection at Brogdale[39] can supply grafts from their tree (ref 1948-729), which appears identical to Flower of Kent, a coarse-fleshed cooking variety.

There are a lot of tutorials that show how to make text for the Blender Game Engine, for example to use in menus. Most involve editors, graphics programs, TGA files, UV mapping, scripting, higher magic and so on. Here is a different approach that takes but a minute.

#Start Blender.
#Remove the default cube. ('''X''')
#Add text. ('''SPACE''' → ''Add'' → ''Text'')
#You may want to switch to edit mode ('''TAB''') and use the variety of features that Blender provides for editing, formatting and laying out text. They are described in the [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Manual/Text Blender Manual Section]. For a start just use '''BACKSPACE''' to delete the letters &quot;Text&quot; and type your own like &quot;This is simple&quot;.
#When finished editing go back to object mode. ('''TAB''')
#Convert your text to a mesh. ('''ALT+C''' → ''Mesh'')
#Press '''P'''

This is as simple as it gets. Of course you can do all kinds of laying out with your text before the conversion in step 6 (check the Blender Manual) as well as modeling, texturing and dynamically manipulating thereafter (as you have a normal mesh). Simply remember that you need to make sure the text is final before you convert it.

This tutorial has been tested with Blender 2.8 RC1.

&quot;However, it should be pointed out that while this is so incredibly simple, it is not poly-count efficient. Remember, there is more to making a game than making it look good--making it run well. If you need a cut-and-dry menu, this is the best way. If you need to worry about performance, then it might be worth it to check out some UV Mapping and external program usage. --[[User:Bullercruz1|Bullercruz1]] ([[User talk:Bullercruz1|talk]]) 23:07, 7 February 2009 (UTC)&quot;

It is also important to note that these fonts can't be dynamic, contrary to bitmap-uvmapped ones...

      <text xml:space="preserve">You may find Learning Klingon difficult due to the alien nature of the language. When Orkand developed tlhIngan Hol, he specifically designed it to violate typical human language rules; Klingon uses a word order rarely found among human languages, and combines sounds in atypical ways. Beginners may have more luck familiarizing themselves with basic words and phrases to get the phonetic pronunciation, than trying to memorize pronunciation rules.

Klingon cursing ranks among the most difficult linguistic activity; the most offensive words and phrases in tlhIngan Hol utilize difficult to produce sounds such as tlh or Q, as well as difficult sequences of phonemes such as toDSaH. Mastering Klingon cursing gives practical experience with pronunciation and sound formation.

==Qapla'==
The Klingon word for success. For many Star Trek fans this is the only word they know. Hopefully, you'll be able to construct whole sentences by the end of this course!

===Q===
The word Qapla' present difficulty at first due to the tlhIngan Hol '''Q''' sound; you pronounce this sound somewhat like the '''q''' but harder and louder, and the difference may not be clear at first. To form the '''Q''' sound, put the back of your tongue as far back into your mouth as you can; then force the air up as if you're trying to cough something up. Pronounce the '''Q''' forcefully. You may find this similar to producing a strong English 'k' sound, but with the back of your tongue pressed to your uvula (the. another way to think of it is a Klingon '''q''' followed by a Klingon '''H'''

==petaQ==
The word '''petaQ''' (pronounced) serves well as an introductory Klingon word; this word functions as an epithet, similar to &quot;bastard&quot; or &quot;asshole&quot; in context. This will undoubtedly provide an enriching addition to your skeletal Klingon vocabulary.

==HIja' or HISlaH==
'''HIja'''' or '''HISlaH''' both mean yes (in answer to a yes/no question)

==ghobe==
And '''ghobe'''' means no (again, in answer to a yes/no question)

==jIyajbe'==
And finally a whole sentence:

What? you ask. How can a whole sentence be encoded in one word?

Next lesson we'll enter the exciting world of Klingon grammar and analyse this sentence. For now, all you need to know is that '''jIyajbe'''' means 'I don't understand' (hopefully, you'll never have to use this phrase!)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Vocabulary==
'''loD'''- man
'''be'''' - woman
'''qIp''' - hit
==Word Order==
One of the most confusing things about Klingon is the word order. In English, we write the subject, then the verb, then the object. In Klingon the object comes first, then the verb and finally the subject.

If you don't know what subjects, objects and verbs are [[Klingon/Grammar/Subject-Object-Verb|click here]].

===Example:===
====Vocabulary====
'''loD''' - man

'''be'''' - woman

'''qIp''' - hit


Look at this Klingon sentence:

'''be' qIp loD'''

From an English point of view it looks like the sentence means 'Woman hits man'

However, that's not right. The object is at the start of the sentence and the subject is at the end in Klingon, so '''be' qIp loD''' actually means 'Man hits woman'

(Note: 'woman hits man' would be '''loD qIp be'''')

==Articles==

There are two articles in English; 'a/an' (indefinite article) and 'the' (definite article). Klingon has no equivalents to these words. So the sentence '''loD qIp be''' could mean any of the following:

''The woman hits the man.''

''A woman hits the man''

''The woman hits a man''

''A woman hits a man''

==Affixes==

An affix is either a prefix or a suffix.
For example, in English the prefix '''dis-''' is used to reverse the meaning of a verb, as in agree and disagree. Suffixes are used to form plurals, as in child and children.

Affixes are central to Klingon grammar and they will be introduced gradually.

===Verb Prefixes===
Only verbs have prefixes. A prefix indicates the pronouns that accompany a verb. As such, they are sometimes called pronomial prefixes. There are almost thirty of them and they will be introduced throughout the course. Here are the first four:

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|Prefix
|Subject 	
|Object
|-
|'''jI-''' 	
|I 	
|none
|-
|'''bI-''' 	
|you (sing.) 	
|none
|-
|'''Su-''' 	
|you (plural) 	
|none
|-
|'''ma-''' 	
|we 	
|none
|}

Suffixes with an object will be introduced in a later lesson.

A prefix is added to the front of a verb to form a simple sentence:

*'''jIQam'''. 	I stand.
*'''bIQam'''. 	You stand. (referring to one person)
*'''SuQam'''. 	You stand. (referring to more than one person)
*'''maQam'''. 	We stand.


Punctuation: Some writers do not end single sentences of Klingon with the final period (.). This practice is common in The Klingon Dictionary. However it is normal practice when writing several sentences to end each with a period, as in English. I would recommend that all sentences in Klingon end with a period.

Verbs can be used without any prefix. The absence of a prefix can be translated in several ways, but the most common is where the subject is any one of he, she, it or they, and with no object.

So '''yIt''', which is a verb meaning ''walk'', on its own can form a sentence meaning ''He walks'', ''She walks'', or ''They walk'', and so on. Of course, if there is a noun, it is used instead of the pronoun. We will see examples of this later.

===Suffixes===

Klingon also makes extensive use of suffixes, which are added to the end of verbs and nouns.

There are several different suffixes, but this lesson introduces just one, '''-be''''. It is added to the end of a verb to negate it, so is often translated by not or do not.

*'''jIyItbe'.''' 	I do not walk.

===Simple Sentences===

In Klingon, the word order in a sentence is reversed. The subject comes after the verb instead of before it. The subject is the noun carrying out the action of the verb, so in Klingon it appears at the end of the sentence:

*'''Qet loD.''' 	The man runs. 

In this sentence, no prefix is required on the verb.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Writing Technical Instructions''' ==

Many people are used to following written instruction, but most have never written instructions for another person or audience. In potential careers you may have to write instructions. While some may be short and brief, other instructions could be longer and take great thought to complete. For this reason it is important to know how to write a persuasive and useful set of instructions. Writing useful instructions can be difficult because people read and comprehend things differently. There are people who are visual learners and using written instructions may pose many problems. How many can you count? Keeping that in mind, as well as the fact that the readers will have all educational backgrounds and various learning styles, will enable you to write comprehensive instructions for everyone. It is important to convey the facts in a simple, logical manner. The information in this section will give you advice and guide you in your writing process.

== '''Important Points When Writing Instructions''' ==

Being persuasive and ensuring that your instructions are usable are two of the most important qualities of a successful set of instructions. You can use these five guidelines to write the most successful and effective set of instructions.


'''Concise and Clear:''' People cannot use your instructions if they cannot understand what you are trying to convey. It is important to use common terminology whenever it is possible, and if you must use unfamiliar words, be sure to be descriptive and explain thoroughly. Stay away from long and wordy sentences that are hard to decipher. Keep sentences short and understandable. If you make your instructions too lengthy, your reader may deviate or forfeit due to frustration. Also, try to avoid the use of slang or phrase words. These might mean something different to different people or cultures.


'''Know Your Audience''' An effective set of instructions needs to be tailored to its specific and intended audience. This is not to say that an audience cannot be broad or inexperienced, but your set of instructions for example, professionals at the workplace, where common knowledge is quite different from the general public, who can is not familiar with the professional verbiage. Never make assumptions about education level. Be sure to choose your audience before drafting instructions. Always remember to keep your audience in mind when writing a new set of instructions.


'''Add Graphical Elements:''' Pictures speak louder than words. Adding graphics to convey your thoughts may be more effective than the words themselves. Instructions that are well illustrated and accompany your written instructions are usually highly successful. It adds an extra level of understanding and allows the reader to skim or troubleshoot if problems occur. Pictures add an additional dimension that will allow your reader to visualize the end product. Also, when using graphics you should be mindful of those visual learners, and adapt the graphics.

Although pictures are great, you must be cautious not to include photographs or illustrations that are confusing or not associated with the actual written instructions. If you pair a poor picture with your instructions, you might cause the reader stress when trying to decipher what you mean.

Also, when taking pictures, ensure that the area is well lit and the pictures are clear and bright. Dark or fuzzy pictures are often difficult to follow. Take care to photograph the subject in the same orientation each time to avoid confusion and consider using a tripod.

Size is also important when using images in instructions. A picture that is too small to see is just as useless as a blurry image. 
 
''To be powerful and understandable, your text and graphic for each step should clearly correlate to that step of the instructions.''

'''Design Your Page:'''  Remember that the readers will actually be performing the task as they read along with the instructions. So you should not use solid blocks of small, hard to decipher text. Make sure to create a design and layout for your instructions page that will allow easy readability and add aesthetic quality. Keeping the page simple, but with a defined hierarchy, will assist the reader in completing the steps of the instructions.

When designing your page, a solid hierarchy is important for scan-ability. The use of bold headings, italics, and roman numerals will aid the reader in finding their place easily and helps with the overall visual appearance.

'''Create a Flow:''' It is important your instructions be planned out in a logical progression. Make sure to state the problem clearly on the first page. Follow your problems with a set of specific steps detailing how to solve the proposed problem. Technical instructions must flow in a logical pattern. For example, when assembling a table it would not be good if you put the finishing touches on it before you had all the screws in place. As stated before, there should also be clear graphics where necessary to clarify the action. Remember, a picture is worth a thousand words. 

'''Test Your Instructions:''' We all know that instructions are difficult to write and that sometimes it sounds good on paper, but when you actually attempt to put the instructions to use, you might find that your wording makes no sense to others. Remember what might be common or obvious to you might baffle your readers, so know your audience. In addition to testing your instructions on yourself, have someone who knows nothing about your product test it. This is called a usability study. Take notes on what worked and what didn't and then revise your instructions accordingly. In the long run the more people that test your instructions, the more effective the final set will be.

== '''Tailoring Instructions to the Intended Audience''' ==

Tailoring your instructions to the intended audience can be one of the most difficult tasks of your writing process. Before you begin your writing process you need to identify who your audience will be and how you can tailor your instructions to make them as understandable as possible. To help you do this there are several questions you can ask yourself:

* ''What background might your audience members have and what prior knowledge might they possess?'' This will help you to determine what you will need to include or not include in your instructions.
* ''What will their needs/interests be?'' 
* ''How will their demographics affect how you write?'' If the majority of your audience comes from a different demographic than you, you need to take into consideration language issues and make sure graphics are clear.
* ''Is there a variability in your audience?'' If your audiences are composed of people with varied backgrounds, your writing should tailored to the majority of your audience and you may also consider adding additional information in appendices.

Based on your answers to the above questions, there are several ways you can insure that your instructions will be as clear as possible to your readers.

* Add information (such as tips, side notes) the readers will need in order to understand your instructions and make sure no key information is missing.
* Do not add information that is unnecessary; it may confuse or mislead your readers.
* Make sure the document is at the level of your audience. 
* Add examples/graphics. Graphics can be very helpful to a reader.
* Have a clear organization. Lack of organization creates confusion and frustration.

== '''Writing Your Instructions''' ==

The following sections are descriptions of the different parts of the general superstructure of a set of instructions. What sections to include will vary based on the complexity of the instructions. Your document may contain any of the following sections:

* Introduction
* Description of Equipment
* Materials and Equipment Necessary
* The procedures
* Visual aids
* Troubleshooting

=== '''Introduction''' ===

What is included in your introduction will depend on what your instructions are for and who will be using them. In any case, the introduction should be brief, but still informative. The introduction can include any or all of the following sections:

* '''Subject/Aim:''' Here you should indicate the specific task that will be explained and what the outcome of the procedure will be.
* '''Intended Readers:''' You may want to identify who the intended readers of the instructions are and if the reader will need additional knowledge or background in order to complete the task.
* '''Scope:''' This will help the reader to know if the instructions will help them complete the task they want to or not.
* '''Organization:''' Giving the reader an overview of what the rest of the instructions will look like can help them to more easily understand them. This section could also go under scope.
* '''Safety:''' It is your responsibility to inform the readers of any hazards or dangers that could occur while they are completing the task. You need to display warnings in a clear and understandable fashion.

=== '''Description of Equipment''' ===

If there is equipment that the reader will have to use in order to operate or repair a piece of equipment, you may want to include a description of it.

=== '''Materials/Equipment List''' ===

Provide a list of equipment that the reader will need to accomplish the task so they know if they need additional tools or things they may not normally have. A list of supplies is also helpful for a reader to make sure that they have all the parts and pieces they need.

=== '''Procedure''' ===

This section is obviously the most important part of an instructions set since it is the actual steps that the reader will follow to complete the task at hand. There are many ways to format the procedures, but most are done with numbered lists. The following are things you should do to make the steps clear and concise:

* Write each step with concise wording so it is easily understood and completed.
** Techniques: 
*** Give readers enough information to perform the step, avoid redundancy.
*** Put the steps in a list. Numbering often works the best.
*** Highlight key words.

* Make sure the reader can locate steps quickly and easily.
** Techniques:
*** Number steps.
*** Skip lines between steps.

* Make actions stand out from the rest of the text.

* Tell the reader what to do if they make a mistake. Not knowing what to do will cause frustration and the reader may give up on the task.

=== '''Visual Aids''' ===

The use of graphics and pictures to correspond to each step is highly recommended. Each person has different learning habits; some like texts while others are better off with pictures. The presence of graphics also allows the reader to make sure he/she is still on the right track. In most situations it would be beneficial to have a combination of both graphics and words.

=== '''Troubleshooting''' ===

Instructions should include this section to tell the reader what to do if something goes wrong during the building process or if the completed project does not look like the expected outcome. Putting this information into a table format often works the best.

For an example set of instructions visit [http://www.io.com/~hcexres/cgi-bin/color_non.cgi?right=on&amp;viewer=../textbook/instrxx5b.html&amp;tagnum=1#stop1:this page] This webpage contains information from the textbook entitled ''Power Tools for Technical Communication'' by David A. McMurrey.

== '''Usability Testing''' ==

Usability testing is an absolutely crucial step in preparing an effective set of instructions. Once you have completed a draft of your instructions, it is important to test them to see where improvements can be made. A usability test should be performed on multiple testers for each updated draft of your instructions. Here is how you go about performing a usability testing:


1. First, you should choose your testers from a group that is representative of your intended audience. In order to single these specific users out, you may need to ask a few preliminary questions. For example, asking what their experience level with the task is or what their job field is. 


2. Next you need to choose how you will evaluate the tester's performance in completing the task. There are different methods to choose from, but one method is called the &quot;Think Aloud&quot; method. When using this method you ask your tester to complete the task using your instructions while verbalizing everything that is going through their head as they go through the instructions. Do not offer any help to the tester as he or she goes through the test, kindly tell them that you can answer their questions at the end. As the tester says what is confusing or hard you take notes. You can record this information in a chart that has three columns. In the first column you will record the problems your tester had. In the second column you write down what the possible cause of each problem was. In the third try to generate a possible solution to the problem or possible ways you can change your instructions to make them more understandable. Be sure to be descriptive in what you want to find out. Be sure to lay out testing form to collect all pertinent information about your testing so no information is overlooked or misplaced.


3. After the test is done look at your notes and ask the tester to elaborate on the problems that you noted. This is an important step because you are getting direct feedback from your audience. Make sure that you understand exactly what was confusing for them, as this will help you in writing the most successful set of instructions. Ask testers how you could change that step or part of the instructions to make them unambiguous.

 
4. Based on your findings edit and update your instructions. After you do so they should be more understandable and easier to follow for your intended audience. In many cases it is appropriate or even necessary to conduct one or more rounds of usability tests as you perfect your instructions. More testing may prove beneficial in discovering problems that were overlooked the first round of testing or because the problems may have been masked by original complications. If time permits, be sure to run as many rounds of usability testing as needed. 
 

* Note: Pay special attention to your intended audience and ensure that you have the number of testers, and accurate demographics necessary to accurately represent your sample. For example, if you are making instructions for a 'beginner audience' and test an all 'expert' audience your sample will not be representative. In addition, if you are wanting to make instructions for a large audience of several ages, gender and experience level, your sample will need to be large and representative of that population.
* If instructions need tester to use both hands throughout (like tying a tie,) consider making all the instructions visible without turning pages so it is easier for the tester to complete the task.

== '''General Writing Style Tips''' ==

Many people resist reading instructions. They try to figure out for themselves how to operate a product or perform a task and will turn to the instructions only if all their efforts fail. When they do read the instructions, they want to understand everything immediately without having to read anything twice. A simple design, plain wording, and clear instructions will be critical to encouraging readers to pay attention to your instructions or procedures.

When writing technical documents and instructions there are several style tips you should keep in mind:

* Use a lot of imperative, command or direct address, kinds of writing. It is OK to use &quot;you&quot; when writing instructions, because you are addressing the reader directly.
* Use active instead of passive voice.
* Do not leave out articles such as a, an and the.
* Use action verbs.
* Ensure graphics match descriptive text to avoid confusion.
* Label graphics by steps, for example Step 17 &quot;...Put...&quot;, the graphic should be labeled clearly with a number &quot;17&quot; or if multiple graphics exists for a line of text writing in chronological order &quot;17a, 17b, etc.&quot; or if different views &quot;17 front, 17 back, etc.&quot;
* Keep text short but descriptive.
* Avoid complicated jargon, use simple verbiage to ensure understanding by a broad spectrum of users.
* Use concise headings and subheadings to describe and highlight each section.
* Leave plenty of white space around headings.
* Highlight safety information and warnings.
* Keep illustrations as simple as possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Word on scientific theories: All theories are wrong, some are useful.&quot;

Eh?  All theories are wrong?  I've never heard this as a serious position, just something to keep in mind: All theories are ''potentially'' wrong.

Removed this, highly problematic and misleading.

== Editing Talk:General Biology/Getting Started/History and Origin of Life ==

Please, I need help from teachers (language corrections and text organization)

&lt;big&gt;about Origin of life: 3 hypotheses&lt;/big&gt;

I am the author and owner of copyrights specified at my website, and I wish to give it free for Wikibooks adding more one existent hypotheses.

The text should be something like:

.Universal Reproduction - The method of comparative anatomy between Cosmological and Biological evolutions suggests a model of galactic system identical to a horizontal base-pair of nucleotides, the fundamental unit of DNA/RNA and a model of cell system with same configuration. Then, the theoretical models suggests how Nature has inserted all informations of our galaxy inside the building blocks of biological systems (aka &quot;life&quot;)and since the same model's configuration is theoretically found at atoms systems,half-material quantum vortexes, the electric-magnetic spectrum of light waves,and any other natural system,the model should be a natural formula called Matrix/DNA.The final deduction is that has no origins of life inside this Universe because the Universe seems to be a place where is occurring a natural process like genetic reproduction of a natural system, living and conscious, that created it through the Big Bang.The theory is called &quot;The Universal Matrix/DNA of Natural Systems and Life's Cycle&quot;.

Despite we can see this formula merely putting our left hand upon it and understanding why and how Nature did our hands in this way, where the sizes and functions of fingers are the same size and functions of life's cycle circuit that makes the formula working, and despite the author have been for 30 years accumulating thousands of factual natural evidences reinforcing the theory,it needs proof that the original galaxies were built like the theoretical model.

This does not seem to be appropriate for chemical engineering.  More for molecular biology, materials science, or biophysics, but not chemical engineering.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Purpose'''&lt;/big&gt;

The amino acid sequence of a protein is a valuable source of insight into its function, structure, and history.
1. The sequence of a protein can be compared with other known sequences to decide whether significant similarities exist. Using computers, a search for kinship between a new sequenced protein and millions of previous previously sequenced ones only takes seconds. If the newly isolated protein is  a member of an established class of protein, we can infer information about the protein's structure and function.
2. Comparison of sequences of the same protein between different species teaches about evolutionary pathways. Genealogical relationships between species can be inferred based on differences in the sequences between their proteins. Assuming the mutation rate of proteins is constant, the analysis of sequences of different proteins from different species can provide information when these two evolutionary lines diverged. For example, comparison of serum albumins found in primates indicate that humans and African apes diverged 5 million years ago instead of 30 million years ago.
3. Amino acids sequences can be searched for the presence of internal repeats. Such repeats reveal the history of the protein, and many proteins have arisen from duplication of primordial genes followed by diversification. 
4. Many proteins contain amino acid sequences that serve as signals for their destinations or controlling their processes
5. Sequences provide a basis for preparing antibodies specific for a protein of interest. Parts of an amino acid sequence will elicit an antibody when injected into a mouse or rabbit. These specific antibodies are useful for determining the amount of proteins in the blood.
6. Amino acid sequences are valuable for making DNA probes used for encoding its proteins. By knowing the primary structure, it permits the use of reverse genetics. DNA sequences that correspond to part of an amino acid sequence can be constructed on the basis of genetic code. These DNA sequences can be used as probes to isolate the gene encoding the protein so that the entire sequence can be determined. The gene in turn can provide information about the physiological regulation of the protein.




&lt;big&gt;'''Determining the amino acid sequences'''&lt;/big&gt;


'''1. Hydrolysis:''' &lt;br/&gt;
The peptide is heated in 6M hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 110&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; C for 24 hours. This procedure is required in order to hydrolyze peptide chain into its [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acid]]. 

'''2. Separation'''&lt;br/&gt;
Amino acids from the peptide is identified by eluting the mixture with buffers of increasing pH in an ion-exchange chromatography column on a sulfonated polystyrene. The volume of  [[Structural Biochemistry/Buffer|buffer]] used can be correlated to a specific type of amino acid. The most acidic side chain amino acid will emerge first, while the most basic side chain amino acid will emerge last. The amount of each amino acid (one, two, or three residues of a same type)can be determined based on the absorbances.

'''3. Quantitation'''&lt;br/&gt;
Amino acids from a peptide are quantified by reacting them with ninhydrin, which is used to detect a microgram of an amino acid. Most amino acids will give an intense blue color, except proline which gives a yellow color due to the secondary amino group in its structure. Furthermore, to detect a nanogram of amino acid, fluorescamine, which reacts with the alpha-amino group, can be used, yielding a highly fluorescent product. The concentration of amino acid is proportional to either the optical absorbance of the sample treated with ninhydrin or the fluorescence emitted by the sample treated with fluorescamine. 

This method tells you only the composition of the proteins, not the sequence of the amino acids. [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification/Edman Sequencing|Edman degradation]] is the one that provides the order of the sequence of amino acids in a protein.

'''''&lt;big&gt;Determination of composition of amino acid is then followed by determination of amino acid sequence. It can be done using 2 complimentary methods:&lt;/big&gt;'''''

'''1.Edman Degradation'''&lt;br/&gt;
[[Image:EDMAN DEGRADATION.jpg‎]]
[[Image:Edman degradation123.png‎‎|thumb|right|250px|The reaction for Edman Degradation occurs through the use of phenylisothiocyanate and in acidic conditions]]

#:This method is done by cleaving the amino acid one by one from the amino terminal. The chemical used for this process is ''Phenyl isothiocyanate''. Amino acids that react with this chemical will form '''phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)-amino acid''' (e.g. PTH-glycine). Under mildly acidic conditions,( PHT)-one termial residue is released. This compound is then identified using chromatographic procedures. Edman degradation is quite simple to perform (the sequencer is automated), but this method is not effective for long peptides (more than 50 residues) because it takes an hour to perform one cycle of degradation.
#:One example of chromatographic procedure is high-pressure liquid chromatography. In this procedure, the PTH-amino acid is separated into its components such that the amino acid's identity can be found by its absorbance and elution time.
#:Edman degradation is the most efficient technique used to sequence proteins without breaking the bonds between residues. Also, the development of automated sequencers has allowed for much quicker and efficient polypeptide sequencing.
'''Controlled cleavage using various chemical and enzyme'''
#:''For listing of special enzyme and chemicals, please see [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry/Proteins/Cutting_Enzymes]
#:Some chemicals and enzymes are known to cleave peptides at certain locations (e.g.: the amino or carboxyl end of certain amino acid). Using these chemicals and enzymes, peptides can be cut into fragments with sizes that can be analyzed using Edman Degradation. By combining 2 or more chemicals and enzymes that cleave peptides at different position, the resulting small fragments (whose amino acid sequence has been identified through Edman Degradation) can be put together in a manner similar to putting together a jigsaw puzzle.

'''Limitations of Edman Degradation'''

Even peptides less than 50 amino acids in length can become problematic when performing Edman degradation. One example of this is when the N-terminal of an amino acid is in an unfavorable position such as the inside of a protein, or when it is sequestered. In addition, Edman degradation may fail due to post-translational modifications of proteins such as glycosidation, acetylation, phosphorylation, and fatty acid addition. For example, the formylation of an amino acid will prevent reaction with phenyl isothiohydantoin. In particular, disulfide bridge between two cysteins (Cys) can complicate the sequencing by sequestering the N-terminus, or sterically hindering the cyclization of the phenyl thiourea intermediate. This could be modified by reducing the disulfides (with beta mercaptoethanol or DDT) and oxidizing the cysteine sidechains to their corresponding sulfonic acids with performic acid to prevent disulfide formation, and then performing the sequence as usual. 

'''2. Mass Spectrometry'''

[[Structural Biochemistry/Protein sequence determination techniques/Mass Spectroscopy|Mass Spectroscopy]] is another technique that can be used to determine protein sequence, but it can only be identified with the parent protein with the fragments cleaved by specific enzymes. The mass of ionized proteins can be obtained by measuring the time of flight of those ions as they are triggered by a laser beam and travel through the flight tube to the detector. The lighter massive ions will travel faster and arrive at the detector first due to Newton's second law (F = ma).  The mass spectrum recorded is then analyzed and compared against a database of sequenced proteins. The sequences of protein fragments, therefore, can be determined in detail if the process is repeated with different enzymes; the fragments become smaller, and the overlapping fragments can thus be used to establish the order.

[[Image:ninhydrin.svg|thumb|Ninhydrin is used to determine the presence of amino acid after hydrolysis]]

{{BookCat}}

'''Limitations of Mass Spectrometry'''

One limitation of using Mass Spectrometry as a means to determine protein sequence is in situations in which more than one amino acid has a specific mass. For example, since Leucine and Isoleucine have the same molecular weight (131.17 g/mol), identical mass spectrometry data would be obtained for these two amino acids and in this case render the method ineffective.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== General Information ==
A significant change in [[Structural Biochemistry/pH|pH]] can lead to harmful reaction to molecular structure, biological activity and function. Protein structure can be disrupted and [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzymes]] denatured due to the effects of pH on cellular structure. Fortunately, nature has evolved a solution to this problem; solutions that resist changes in pH are called buffers. If an acid is added to an unbuffered solution, the pH will change suddenly and proportional to the amount of acid added. However, the pH will drop gradually in buffer solution when acid is added. Buffers also mitigate the pH increase caused by adding base.

Buffers are aqueous systems that resist changes in pH as acid or base is added. They are usually composed of a weak acid and its conjugate base. Biological buffers, mixture of weak acids (the proton donors) and their conjugate bases (the proton acceptors), help maintain biomolecules in optimal ionic state of pH 7. Buffering is a result of two reversible reaction equilibrium occurring in a solution of about equal concentration of proton donor and its conjugate proton acceptor; when acid or base is added to a buffer, it results in a change in the ratio of the relative concentrations of the weak acid and its anion, or the pH. However, this change in pH is significantly greater than it would be without a buffering solution to accommodate excess hydronium or hydroxide ions.

== Properties ==
A buffer solution usually contains a weak acid and its conjugate base, but it can also contain a weak base and its conjugate acid. When H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; are added to a buffer, the weak acid's conjugate base will become protonated, thereby &quot;absorbing&quot; the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; before the pH of the solution lowers significantly. Similarly, when OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; is added, the weak acid will become deprotonated to its conjugate base, thereby resisting any increase in pH before shifting to a new equilibrium point. In biological systems, buffers prevent the fluctuation of pH by processes that produce acid or base by-products to maintain an optimal pH.

Each conjugate acid-base pair has a characteristic pH range as an effective buffer. The buffering region is about 1 pH unit on either side of the pKa of the conjugate acid, where it has the most effectiveness for resisting large changes in pH when either acid or base is added.

== Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation ==

The equilibrium constant for the deprotonation of an acid is written as: 

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{K_a = \frac{[A^+][A^-]}{[HA]} }&lt;/math&gt;    (1)

Where [A&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;-&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;] is the concentration of a conjugate base and [HA] is the concentration of an acid

Taking logarithms of both sides, we get

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\log K_a = \log H^+ - \log \frac{[A^-]}{[HA]} }&lt;/math&gt;     (2)

subtract both sides by log([A&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;-&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]/[HA]), we get

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{pH = pK_a + \log \frac{[A^-]}{[HA]} }&lt;/math&gt;     (3)

This is the Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation. It describes the dissociation of a weak acid (HA) in the presence of its conjugate base (A&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;-&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).

The midpoint of the buffering region is when one half of the acid reacts to dissociation and where the concentration of the proton donor (acid) equals that of the proton acceptor (base); the pH of the equimolar solution of acid is equal to the pKa. (When the concentration ratio for conjugated base and weak acid, [A&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;-&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]/[HA], is 1:1)

== Limitations ==
Buffers usually work well at a pH close to the pKa value of the acidic component. If too much acid is added to the buffer, or if the concentration is too strong, extra protons remain free and the pH will fall sharply. This is reflected in the titration curve and is known as the buffer capacity.

== Titration curve ==
This curve demonstrated the capacity of a buffer. In the middle part of the curve, it is flat because the addition of base or acid does not affect the pH of the solution drastically - this is the '''buffer zone'''. However, once the curve extends out of the buffer region, it will increase tremendously when a small amount of acid or base added to the buffer system. This effect demonstrated the buffer capacity of the solution.

'''H&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;3&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;4&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; titration curve'''

== Physiological Buffers ==

Phosphoric acid system (pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = 7.4) and carbonic acid system (pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.6) are two important buffer systems in human body.  The phosphate buffer system is an effective buffer in the cytoplasm of all cells.  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; acts as the proton donor and HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt;- acts as the proton acceptor.

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; ⇋ H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt;

The bicarbonate buffer system is used to buffer blood plasma where the carbonic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) acts as a proton donor and bicarbonate (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; acts as a proton acceptor.

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  ⇋ HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

In this buffer system, when the pH of the blood plasma is too high, the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; of blood plasma is lowered.  The H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is dissociated to H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.  The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the lungs is dissolved in the blood plasma resulting in a lower pH.  On the other hand if the pH of the blood plasma is too low, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is added to the blood increasing the concentration of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.  This results in an increase of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the blood plasma.  The increase in the partial pressure of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the air space of the lungs causes extra CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be exhaled ultimately resulting in a raise in pH.  Since the concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be adjusted rapidly through changes in the rate of respiration, a large reservoir of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can quickly adjust this equilibria to keep blood pH at a nearly constant rate.

{{BookCat}}

Buffers are also important for enzyme activities. There is an optimal pH for each enzyme. For example [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]] cleavage enzyme pepsin works at pH 1-6 (pH=2 max), tripsin at pH 2-9 (ph=6 max) and alkaline phospatase at pH 4-10(pH=8 max). 

In addition to this, some reactions should be carried out at constant pH which is provided by buffer systems.</text>

[[Image:Hydride.png‎|This is a common form of a covalent bond where the hydrogens both share one electron each|right|thumb]]
'''Covalent bonds''' are chemical bonds that are formed by sharing valence electrons between adjacent atoms.  This type of bonding is mostly seen in interactions of non-metals. Covalent bonds allow elements the ability to form multiple bonds with other molecules and atoms - a fundamental necessity for the creation of macromolecules.
In the covalent bond, as the distance between the nuclei decreases, each nucleus starts to attract the other atom's electron, which lowers the potential energy of the system. Anyway, when the attraction increases, the repulsions between the nuclei and between the electrons increase as well. In covalent bonding, each atom achieves a full outer (valence) level of electrons. Each atom in a covalent bond counts the shared electrons as belonging entirely to itself. Most covalent substances have low electrical conductivity because electrons are localized and ions are absent. Overall, the atoms in a covalent bond vibrate, and the energy of these vibrations can be studied with the IR spectroscopy.

==Octet Rule==
A general rule to follow when looking at covalent bonding is the octet rule, also known as the noble gas configuration.  An atom participating in covalent bonding must (with few exceptions) follow the octet rule, which states that an atom must have eight electrons around it.  These electrons can be shared or unshared.  The two atoms do not need to share their electrons equally; an electron pair can be donated from one atom instead of each atom donating one electron.  A periodic table can be used to determine the number of valence electrons an atom.  The general rule is that all atoms will be stable if they can have eight electrons around them.  Therefore different atoms can share their unpaired electrons with other atoms with unpaired electrons to gain an octet.

There are quite a few exceptions to this rule.  Two very important ones are Hydrogen (H) and Helium (He).  These atoms do not have octets and only need a total of two electrons to be stable.  This is because hydrogen and helium only contain a 1s electron shell, which can only hold two electrons.  Other exceptions occur when the total number of electrons in a molecule or between two molecules is an odd number.  These molecules tend to be very reactive.  Also, atoms past the second row on the periodic table can have more than eight electrons surrounding them. &lt;ref&gt;Organic Chemistry by Vollhardt and Shore&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in phosphorus pentafluoride (PF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) the phosphorus is bonded to 10 electrons, and in sulfur hexafluoride (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) the sulfur atom is bonded to 12 electrons. Molecules can also be electron deficient, meaning there are not enough available electrons to complete full octets around all the atoms in the molecule. An example of an electron deficient molecule is boron trichloride (BCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). In this molecule, the boron atom is only bonded to three electron pairs, while the chlorides are surrounded by full octets. &lt;ref&gt;http://chemed.chem.wisc.edu/chempaths/GenChem-Textbook/Exceptions-to-the-Octet-Rule-573.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Covalent Bonds==
Multiple covalent bonds can be formed between atoms, which are stronger than single bonds and have higher bond energy and shorter bond lengths. The bond order is used to determine the number of pairs of electrons in a covalent bond. When a molecule has double and single covalent bonds, it can have different chemical forms of equal energy as resonance structures, which has more stability and the bond is the average of the double and single covalent bond.  The characteristics of a covalent bond can also be effected by the two atoms it joins.

===Single Bonds===
[[File:Elektronenformel Punkte HCl.svg|An electron dot diagram of a covalent bond between chlorine and hydrogen|thumb|left]]
Single bonds are one of the weaker types of covalent bonds.  Single covalent bonds are also called sigma bonds.  These are made when only two electrons are shared.  This leads to an overlap of the orbitals and a merging of the electron density clouds.  Single bonds tend to be very flexible allowing atoms to rotate around the bond.  An example of a single bond is a carbon-carbon (C-C) covalent bond has a bond length of 1.54 A and bond energy of 356 kJ/mol.

Note that the properties of a single bond depends not only on the two atoms that is bonds but also on the atoms surrounding those atoms.  Sigma bonds have no nodal planes.

Some covalent single bonds will also have double bonds properties, which are shorter, rigid and non-rotated. One example is peptide bond in proteins which connect each amino acid together to form polypeptide. The peptide-bond is 1.32 A which is shorter than 1.54 A (C-C). The energy that needs to break the peptide bond is much higher than the single bond and this non-rotated single bond contributes the planar property in the polypeptide chain, which also makes the peptide bond more stable than the normal single bond. The double bond properties are contributed by the resonance structure of the pepetide bond.

===Double bonds===
[[Image:pi-bond.jpg|frame|Formation of a Pi-Bond from two p-orbitals.|thumb|right]]
Double bonds occur when a covalent bond consists of four shared electrons.  A double covalent bond contains a sigma bond and a pi bond.  Pi-bonds apply to the overlapping p-orbitals. The orbitals can only overlap in a side-by-side arrangement leading to one nodal plane on the internuclear axis. A single covalent bond only contains a sigma bond. Double bonds tend to be shorter than their single bond equivalents and stronger.  Double bonds also create electron density around the bond.  Unlike single bonds, double bonds are not flexible and the two adjoining atoms cannot rotate about the bond.

===Triple Bonds===

[[Image:Acetylene-CRC-IR-dimensions-2D.png‎ |thumb|C2H2.]]

A triple covalent bond contains one sigma bond and two pi bonds where six electrons are being shared.  These bonds are stronger than double bonds and shorter.  They are more rigid than double bonds and have a larger electron density.  The most common triple bonds are on carbons like C2H2.  The skeletal form to draw a triple bond is three straight lines connecting the two atoms.

===Polar Covalent Bonds===
Covalent bonds can be polar or non-polar depending on the electro-negativity value of the atoms bonded together. If there is a very large difference between the two atoms' electro-negativity values, a polar covalent bond is formed. The atoms do not need to posses the same electro-negativity values, or be of the same element, but they need to be relatively close in their values. If the electro-negativity values are closer, the co-valency between the atoms will be stronger. An exception to this rule is when a molecule possesses symmetry. When the overall dipole moment is zero, such as linear molecule of CO2, the molecule is consider non-polar. The more electronegative atom will attract the electrons, making itself have a partial negative charge and giving the other atom a partial positive charge. These partial negative and positive charges are what account for the dipole-dipole, dipole-induce dipole, and induced dipole-induced dipole interaction. This attraction-to-repulsion stability is what gives the covalent bonds stability. In addition to the electro-negativity differences between atoms, covalent bonding also depends on the angles of adjacent atoms relative to each other. &lt;ref&gt;Berg, Jeremy; Tymoczko, John; Stryer, Lubert. Biochemistry, 6th edition. W.H. Freeman and Company. 2007. (7)&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical accepted values for determination of type of bonds:

Difference in electronegativity - X &lt; 0.5 - Non-polar covalent bond

Difference in electronegativity - 0.5 ≤ X ≤ 1.9 - Polar covalent bond

Difference in electronegativity - 1.9 &lt; X - Ionic bond

===Specific Types Of Covalent Bonds===
&lt;big&gt;'''Disulfide Bonds '''&lt;/big&gt;
In Chemical interactions, certain compounds can react to create a '''disulfide bond''', which is a type of covalent bond that is usually derived by the coupling of two thiols (-S-H). These interactions can also be called '''SS-bonds''' or '''disulfide bridges''', with the connectivity of these interactions mainly being R-S-S-R . 

'''Role in Protein Folding'''
Disulfide bonds can play a vital role in the tertiary structure of proteins in the effect they have on protein folding and stability. These disulfide bonds between proteins usually are formed between the thiol groups of cysteine residues. The other amino acid group in which sulfur appears is methionine, which cannot form disulfide bonds.
[[Image:Disulfide-bond.png|thumb|left|alt=Formation of a Disulfide Bond.|Formation of a Disulfide Bond.]]
Disulfide bonds help to stabilize the tertiary structure of a protein molecule in several ways, for example, The disulfide bonds destabilize the unfolded form of a protein by lowering its overall entropy, or state or chaos. Also, when the disulfide bonds  link two segments of the protein chain, this increases the effective local concentration of protein residues and lowers the effects of water in a that specific region. Since water molecules are known to attack amide-amide bonds, lowering the effects of water in these disulfide bond- regions helps to stabilize a protein.

===Covalent Bond: Bond Length and Bond Energy===
The bond energy (BE) is the energy required for the attraction or breakage between the atoms. Since it is the energy needed to break the attraction between the atoms, the bond energy is endothermic and positive. However, the energy required for the formation of the bond is exothermic and a negative value. 
The bond length is the distance between the nuclei of two covalent bonded atoms. It can be calculated based on the total radii of the bonded atoms. As a result, the bond length increases when the covalent radius increases. And the shorter the bond length, the higher bond energy will be needed to break the attraction between the atoms because shorter distance between the atoms means the bond will be stronger and harder to break. On the other hand, the longer the bond length is, the lower bond energy is needed to break a weaker bond. 
One can use bond energy to determine the ΔH&lt;sub&gt;rxn&lt;/sub&gt;. In a reaction, when two atoms react with each other to form the product of different atoms, there are two types of bond energy. One is the energy required for the reactant to be broken and the other one is the energy required for products to be formed. As a result, the difference between the two bond energy is the enthalpy or the work of the reaction. 
ΔH&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;rxn&lt;/sub&gt;= ΔH&lt;sub&gt;reactant bonds broken&lt;/sub&gt; + ΔH&lt;sub&gt;product bonds formed&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silberberg, Martin S.(2010).

      <comment>/* Hydrogen bonding in DNA */ ± Image</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''hydrogen bond''' is formed by a '''dipole-dipole force''' between an electronegative atom (the hydrogen acceptor) and a hydrogen atom that attaches covalently with another electronegative atom (the hydrogen donor) of the same molecule or of a different molecule.  Only nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine atoms can interact with hydrogen to form hydrogen bond; this is different than a hydrogen covalent bond. In a hydrogen bond, the lone pair electrons on oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine interact with the partial positive hydrogen that is covalently bonded to one of those atoms. The hydrogen atom in a hydrogen bond is shared by two electronegative atoms such as oxygen or nitrogen.) Hydrogen bonds are responsible for specific base-pair formation in the DNA double helix and a major factor to the stability of the DNA double helix structure.  A ''hydrogen-bond donor'' includes the hydrogen atom and the atom to which it is most tightly linked with. The hydrogen-bond also play a very important roles in proteins' structure because it stabulizes the secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure of proteins which formed by alpha helix, beta sheets, turns and loops. The hydrogen-bond connected the amino acides between different polypeptide chains in proteins structure.    The ''hydrogen-bond acceptor'' is the atom that is less tightly linked to the hydrogen atom. 

Hydrogen bonds are fundamentally electrostatic interactions and are much weaker than covalent bonds.  They are, however, the strongest kind of dipole-dipole interaction. The electronegative atom to which the hydrogen atom is bonded with pulls electron density away from the hydrogen atom, developing a partial positive charge.  Therefore, the hydrogen atom can then interact with a partial negatively charged atom through an electrostatic interaction.

[[Image:hydrogenbond.jpg|thumb|Hydrogen bond with ammonia]]

== Components ==
Hydrogen bonding is a form of '''electrostatic interaction''' between a hydrogen atom bonded to two electronegative atoms; one of which is the hydrogen-bond donor that has a stronger bond between itself and the hydrogen. These electronegative atoms are nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine; this electronegative atom pulls electron density away from the hydrogen atom, giving it a partially positive charge. This partial positive charge is attracted to the partial negative charge of the hydrogen bond acceptor (an electron density rich atom).  The chemical bond formed between the hydrogen-bond donor, hydrogen atom, and hydrogen-bond acceptor has a straight, linear structure.

== H-bonding ==
'''Hydrogen bonding (H-bond)''' is a non-covalent type of bonding between molecules or within them, intermolecularly or intramolecularly. This type of bonding is much weaker and much longer than the covalent bond and ionic bonds, but it is stronger than a van der waals interaction. It also carries some features of covalent bonding: direct and straight. In other words, H-bond donor and H-bond acceptor lie along the straight line. In order to form an H-bond, an H-bond donor and H-bond acceptor are required. The H-bond donor is the molecule that has a hydrogen atom bonded to a highly electronegative, small atom with available valence (N, F, and O follow the above description the best because they are very electronegative, making H, which is covalently attached to them, very positive). The H-O, H-N, and H-F bonds are extremely polar; as a result, the electron density is easily withdrawn from the hydrogen atom towards the electronegative atom. The partially positive hydrogen in one molecule attracts to partially negative lone pair of the electronegative atom on the other molecule and H-bond forms as a result of such an interaction. All the hydrogen bonds vary in strength

Other important facts about hydrogen bonding are as follows. The small sizes of nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine are essential to H bonding for two reasons. One is that it makes those atoms electronegative that their covalently bonded H is highly positive. Other reason is that it allows the lone pair on the other oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine to come close to the H. Also, hydrogen bonding has a profound impact in many systems. Hydrogen bonding is also involves in the action of many enzymes [The Molecular Nature of Matter and Change].

==Properties of Water Due to Hydrogen Bonding==
Ammonia, water, and hydrogen fluoride all have higher boiling points than other similar molecules, which is due to hydrogen bonds. Bonds between hydrogen and these strongly electronegative atoms are very polar, with a partial positive charge on hydrogen. This partially positive hydrogen is strongly attracted to the partially negative oxygen on the adjacent molecule. In general, boiling points rise with the increase molecular weight, both because the additional mass requires higher temperature for rapid movement of the molecules and because heavier molecules have a greater London forces. Water's freezing point is also much higher than other similar molecules. An unusual feature is that it decreases in density when it freezes. The tetrahedral structure around each oxygen atom, with two regular bonds to hydrogen and two to other molecules. This requires a great amount of space between the ice molecules. Clathrates are molecules trapped in holes of solid, like ice, that is theorized to be able to be used as anesthesia.

== Hydrogen bond and physical properties ==
Hydrogen bonding has a significant influence on a molecule's '''boiling points'''. The boiling point usually increases with the increase of the molar mass. However, molecules that are involved in intermolecular H-bonding bonding have much higher boiling points in comparison with the molecules of the same molar mass that are not involved in H-bonding. This is because the unusually strong H-bonding forces allow for stronger interaction between water molecules and therefore creating a stronger bond and higher boiling point. &lt;ref name=&quot;hydrogen bonding&quot;&gt;[http://www.chemguide.co.uk/atoms/bonding/hbond.html hydrogen bonding], October 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, H-bonding is responsible for many unusual proprieties of water, such as its high boiling point, melting point, heat of vaporization, high dielectric constant, surface tension, capillary action etc. 

Hydrogen bonding can occur between hydrogen and four other elements. Oxygen(most common), Fluorine, Nitrogen and Carbon. Carbon is the special case in that it only really interacts in hydrogen bonding when it is bound to very electronegative elements such as Fluorine and Chlorine. &lt;ref name=&quot;hydrogen bonding&quot;&gt;[http://www.chemguide.co.uk/atoms/bonding/hbond.html hydrogen bonding], October 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrogen bonding is an important component of the three major macromolecules in biochemistry such as '''proteins''', '''nucleic acids''', and '''carbohydrates'''. The H-bonding is responsible for the structure and properties of proteins(enzymes). Hydrogen bonding is applicable in these biomolecules because of functional groups present. Some such are the carboxylic acid, alcohol or even amine groups. These provide either an hydrogen, oxygen or nitrogen for possible hydrogen bonds.&lt;ref name=&quot;hydrogen bonding&quot;&gt;[http://www.chemguide.co.uk/atoms/bonding/hbond.html hydrogen bonding], October 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hydrogen bond in proteins ==
[[File:1RRX pdb slab 4.png|thumbnail|right|Hydrogen bonding within the &quot;green fluorescent protein&quot; 1RRX.]]
As previously mentioned, hydrogen bond can be intermolecular (ex. the bonding of water molecules) as well as intramolecular (ex. the bonding of protein and DNA).  The secondary structure of protein forms as a result of H-bonding between amino acids. For example, an α-helix is a rod-like secondary structure that forms as a result of H-bonding between the carboxyl group of (i) amino acid to the amino group of (i+4) amino acid. The turn (loop family) is a secondary structure which forms as a result of H-bond between carboxyl group of (i) amino acid and amino group of (i+3) amino acid. The β-sheet is a secondary structure which forms as a result of H-bonding between two or more β-strands. An anti-parallel β-strands forms hydrogen bonds that are straight due to the carbonyl group and the amino group being directly aligned, while a parallel β-strand forms hydrogen bonds that are slightly weaker in comparison to the anti-parallel because the carbonyl group and the amino group don't align perfectly, which forms a longer and weaker hydrogen bond.

The solubility of proteins in water is dependent on the ability to form hydrogen bonds with the protein surface. Proteins that have a greater hydrophilic surface content are generally more capable of forming hydrogen bonds with the surrounding water. The alteration of salt concentration of the solution, as is performed in salting out/in, creates a shielding effect that reduces the ability to form an H-bond with the hydrogens in water. The protein precipitation method of salting out utilizes this concept in protein fractionation.

==Hydrogen bonding in water==

[[File:3D model hydrogen bonds in water.jpg||thumb|100pix‎|Hydrogen bonding in water]]

The simplest example of a hydrogen bond can be found in water molecules. A water molecule consists of one oxygen atom attached to two hydrogen atoms. A hydrogen bond can be formed between two molecules of water. In the case of liquid water where there are many water molecules present, each water molecule could potentially hydrogen bond with up to 4 other molecules (2 through its 2 hydrogen atoms with each hydrogen bonding to another oxygen and another 2 through its 2 lone pairs on the oxygen that can hydrogen bond to 2 other hydrogen atoms). 

Although water has a low molecular mass, it has an unusually high boiling point. This property can be attributed to the large amount of hydrogen bonds that exists within water. Since these bonds are difficult to break, water’s melting point, viscosity, and boiling point are relatively high in comparison to other liquids that are similar but lack the hydrogen bonding. Water contains substantially more hydrogen bonds (up to 4) relative to certain other liquids that also have hydrogen bonding. An example would be ammonia in which the nitrogen only has one lone pair but 3 hydrogen atoms and thus only capable of forming up to 2 hydrogen bonds. 

Hydrogen bonding can also explain why the density of ice is less than the density of liquid water. In water's liquid form, the hydrogen bonding that keeps the molecules close together are constantly being broken and remade repeatedly at room temperature. But as the water turns into ice, the hydrogen bonding causes the water molecules to form a rigid, lattice structure, which causes large gaps between the molecules, resulting in it's smaller density yet larger volume.

Hydrogen bonding also accounts for water's high surface tension. The large availability of hydrogen bonding between water molecules (4 hydrogen bonds to one water molecule) proves how well they can stick to each other, forming a strong and stretchy surface. Common examples from which this characteristic can be observed include a cup filled slightly over the top without spilling over, or small organisms that are able to stay on top of water without breaking its surface. 

Water has a different number of hydrogen bonds depending upon the temperature. It is estimated that at 0oC each water molecule has an average of 3.69 hydrogen bonds, while at 25oC it has an average of 3.59 hydrogen bonds, and at 100oC it has an average of 3.24 bonds. The decreasing hydrogen bonds with an increase in temperature can be attributed due to the increase of molecular motion.

==Hydrogen bonding in DNA==
DNA contains four bases:Guanine, Cytosine, Adenine, and Thymine.  The complementary base pairs of guanine with cytosine and adenine with thymine connect to one another using hydrogen bonds. These hydrogen bonds between complementary nucleotides is what keeps the two strands of a DNA helix together. Each base can also form hydrogen bonds with the external environment such as with water. Although these internal and external hydrogen bonds are fairly weak, the consolidated power of all the millions of hydrogen bonds in DNA make it a stable molecule. Also, the hydrogen bonds on the phosphate groups on each nucleotide interact inducing two strands of DNA to conform to a helical structure.

{{BookCat}}

The base pairing in the DNA (one purine and one pyrimidine base) can be explained in more details.  In addition to holding the DNA strands together, the hydrogen bonding between the complementary bases also sequester the bases in the interior of the double helix.  Therefore, the hydrogen bonding between the bases reinforces the hydrophobic effects that stabilize the DNA.  The hydrophobic bases are again kept in the inside of the helix, whereas the polar exterior is touching the solvent water.  The hydrogen bonding is a weak molecular force, but it is an additive effect that stabilizes the DNA molecule.  The bases are precisely held by hydrogen bonding with the energy of 1 to 5 kcal/ mol (4 to 21 kJ/mol).  

The hydrogen bonding in the DNA bases of one purine (guanine and adenine) and one pyrimidine (cytosine and thymine) creates a similar shape. The pairing of guanine and cytosine shape and structure is very similar to that of the pairing of adenine and thymine. Cytosine and Guanine are held together by three hydrogen bonds. The pairing of adenine and thymine share two hydrogen bonds, thus the bond is slightly weaker and slightly longer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Van Der Waals interactions (also known as London Dispersion forces)''' are weak attractions that occur between molecules in close proximity to each other.  The basis of these interactions is that the distribution of electronic charge around an atom fluctuates with time.  As two atoms come closer to each other, this attraction increases until they are separated by the van der Waals ''contact distance''. When two molecules are too close to each other, the potential energy due to repulsion is very high, which means that it is unstable. There is repulsion even though the molecules are neutral, because there is an electron cloud surrounding each molecule. When these molecules get too close to each other, repulsion between the molecules occur. As the molecules move farther apart from each other, the potential energy due to repulsion decreases. This force was named after Johannes Diderik van der Waals, a Dutch physicist who studied them extensively.

[[Image:Argon dimer potential.png|thumb|300px|right|An example of interaction energy-distance relation graph obtained from argon dimer. Because of London dispersion forces, the interaction energy greatly increase when the distance between two atoms smaller han 3.8A]]

== Van der Waals radius ==

[[File:VanderwaalsAttraction.JPG|thumb|Vander Waals attraction]]
Two molecules can interact by Van der Waals forces when they are at a certain distance apart. The molecules are stabilized by Van der Waals interaction at the '''Van der Waals contact distance''' because the potential energy of the system at this distance is at its lowest. In the potential energy diagram shown to the right, the minimum potential energy point corresponds to the Van der Waals contact distance.

As the distance between the molecules increase, the weakly bonded molecules lose their stability and are no longer affected by the Van der Waals forces due to their large distance apart. When the distance between the two molecules decrease, however, the stabilization is decreased as well due to the electrostatic repulsion between the molecules. This level of repulsion is felt more drastically and more intensely in Van der Waals interactions than in [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Ionic interaction|ionic interactions]], where the level of repulsion is felt more gradually.

== Energy in Val der Waals interaction ==
Energies associated with van der Waals interactions are quite small. Usually, they are about 2 to 4 kJ/mol per atom pair. When the surfaces of two large molecules come together, a large number of atoms are in Van der Waals contact, and the net effect, summed over many atoms pairs can be substantial. Macromolecules such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]] and [[Structural Biochemistry/DNA|DNA]] contain numerous sites of potential van der Waals interactions that the cumulative effect of these small binding forces can be enormous; hence the most stable structure for macromolecules is that where weak interactions are maximized.{{BookCat}}

===== Van der waals interaction in proteins structure =====
Other than hydrogen-bond and disulfide bonds, Val der waals interaction is the another important bonding type that helps stabilizing the protein structure. In the coiled-coil protein, there are Heptad repeat which form by the side chain interaction between each alpha helix; hepad-repeat is repeated in every 7th residues. If these repeating residues are hydrophobic, such as leucine, van der waals interaction will be formed to stabilize this protein structure.

The pH of a solution is defined as the negative logarithm of its hydrogen ion (H+) concentration.
For example, If the concentration of H+ ion is 10^(-7), 
             then the pH of the solution = -log (10)^(-7) = 7.
Therefore, as the Hydrogen Ion concentration increases, pH value decreases
          &amp; as the Hydrogen Ion concentration decreases, pH value increases
The pH of a solution is a measure of the hydronium ion (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) concentration on a logarithmic scale. The pH scale range is 0-14 from acidic to basic, respectively. The pH of a neutral compound, such as pure water at room temperature, is 7. The concentration of hydronium ions is related to the concentration of hydroxide ions by the dissociation of water:

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt; H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

There is some confusion as to the meaning of the &quot;p&quot; in pH. Although many believe it to stand for &quot;power&quot; or &quot;potential,&quot; (i.e. power of hydrogen), that may not actually be the case. According to Jens G Norby's research (Dept of Biophysics, University of Aarhus, DK), &quot;power of hydrogen&quot; is actually a false association made by W.M. Clark. In actuality, Sorensen, the originator of the term, &quot;pH&quot; did not explicitly state a meaning for the &quot;p,&quot; and it appears to be an arbitrary selection of letters &quot;in his initial explanation of the electrometric method.&quot; For more information about this misconception, see, &quot;The origin and the meaning of the little p in pH.&quot;

pH is biologically important because it affects the structure and activity of macromolecules. pH is important in homeostatic processes. For example, most animals breathe not because they lack oxygen, but because CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; buildup in the blood increases the blood acidity beyond normal levels. Enzyme function is especially sensitive to pH: each  has an optimum pH at which they have maximum catalytic ability. Extreme pH levels can denature enzymes, completely disrupting their function. Other proteins are also destabilized by extreme pH levels.

The pH and pOH of a solution are related such that: pH+pOH=14. For example, if the pH of a solution is 5, the pOH of the same solution will be 14-5=9.

The pH of distilled water is 7, this is neutral. Any solution with a pH below 7 (i.e. pH 0 to pH 6.9) is acidic and any solution with a pH above 7 (i.e. pH 7.1 to pH 14) is basic.

Acidic solutions have a pH between 0 and 6.9 (the stomach contains HCl, which has a pH ~2). Alkaline solutions have a pH between 7.1-14 (the small intestine is pH 9). Neutral solutions are neither acidic nor alkaline so their pH is 7.

Hydrogen Chloride dissociates into hydrogen and chloride ions:

HCl(aq)=  	 	H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  	 	+  	 	Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;  	

Water dissociates to produce Hydrogen and hydroxide ions:

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) 		= 		H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; 		+ 		OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; 	

Sodium Hydroxide dissociates to produce Sodium and hydroxide ions:

NaOH(aq) 		= 		Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; 		+ 		OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

In each case the concentration of Hydrogen ions can be measured or calculated.[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] represents hydrogen ions and the square brackets represent concentration.

==Mathematics==

The pH of a solution is calculated by

'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;pH = -log [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

By convention H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is used to represent hydronium ions (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). A log system simplifies the notation of the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration in a medium. A pH increase of 1 is indicative of a ten-fold decrease of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration. This negative logarithmic relationship between the hydrogen ion concentration and pH means that a lower pH indicates a higher concentration. Conversely a higher pH indicates a lower concentration of hydrogen ions.

The ionization of water is expressed by equilibrium constant: K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; = [H+][OH-]/[H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O], which is 1.0 * 10&lt;sup&gt;−14&lt;/sup&gt; at 25°C.

The tendency of an acid, HA, to lose a proton and form its conjugate base, A-, is defined by the acid dissociation constant, K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;.  Another quantitative measurement of acidity is the pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, which is calculated from the K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; (pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = -log K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;).  A smaller K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; means a higher value of pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, thus a higher value of pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is equivalent to a weaker acid due to less dissociation of the acid into H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and its conjugate base. Similar to pH, a single integer difference in pKa represents a tenfold difference.

The pH of a solution is determined by relative concentrations of acids and bases. 

Using the reaction of the dissociation of a weak acid, HA:

'''HA''' &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt; '''H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''' + '''A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
'''

The '''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''' can be written as:
 
'''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''' = [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;][A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] / [HA]

and rearranged as:
 
[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = K*[HA] / [A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]

Taking the negative log of each term:

-log[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = -log(K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) + log([A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]/[HA])

Letting pH = -log[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] results in:

pH = -logK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; + log([A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]/[HA])

Letting pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = -logK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; gives:

'''pH = pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; + log([A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]/[HA])'''

This relationship of pH to pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is known as the '''Henderson-Hasselbach equation'''. 

When the concentration of an acid, HA, and its conjugate base, A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, are equal:

log([A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]/[HA]) = log 1 = 0

Yielding:

'''pH=pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'''

meaning that the pH of the solution is equivalent numerically to the pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of the acid. This point is also known as the half equivalence point.

This equation is useful for calculating the pH of a buffer solution, or a solution containing a known quantity of weak acid (or base) and its conjugate base (or conjugate acid). From a biochemistry perspective, Hederson-Hasselbach can be applied to amino acids. However, this equation does not account for the ionization of water in a solution and thus is not useful for calculating the pH of solutions strong acids or bases.

See Buffer for more information on weak acid or weak base calculations.

==pH Calculation for Polyprotic Acid==

Polyprotic acid such as sulfuric acid, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or phosphoric acid, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, is capable of being deprotonated more than once because of the presence of two or more H atoms within the molecule. However, the pKa of each form of a polyprotic acid determines the contributions of hydrogen atoms, and consequently a change in pH, to a solution.
 
For example, consider the dissociation phosphoric acid:                     

     '''H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;   &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt;    H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;           ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = 7.1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;'''''    (1)
        '''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'''  =  &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{[H_2PO_4^-][H^+]}{[H_3PO_4]}&lt;/math&gt; 
     '''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt;    HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;           ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;'''''    (2)
        '''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'''  =  &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{[HPO_4^{2-}][H^+]}{[H_2PO_4^-]}&lt;/math&gt;
     '''HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt;    PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;            ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt;'''''   (3)
        '''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'''  =  &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{[PO_4^{3-}][H^+]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]}&lt;/math&gt;

Supposing we have 0.01 M H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; we could calculate the pH of the solution based on the Ka values. Comparing the three pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, it is clear that the first deprotonation (1) contributes the most H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; because it is the highest value. At equilibrium, ''x'' can represent the M [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] and this value is the same for [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] as well. While [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] can be expressed as ''0.01-x'' M. Therefore,
:::'''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'''  =  &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{(x)(x)}{0.01-x}&lt;/math&gt; = 7.1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;

After which the quadratic equation can be used: x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 0.0071x - 0.000071 = 0
:To solve this equation, we use &lt;math&gt;x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;, and then obtain
::: x = 5.59 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; = [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]
::: pH = -log[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = -log 5.59 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; = 2.25

A less time-consuming (but also less accurate) approach can be used to avoid using the quadratic equation. If an acid dissociates less than 5% or if the acid concentration to K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; ratio is greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the following equation can be used:
       [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{K_a\times C_a}&lt;/math&gt; ; where C&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is the concentration of acid.      (4)
However, in this case we see that 0.01M H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; dissociates more than 5% in the first deprotonation.
::: &lt;math&gt;\frac{0.00559 * 100}{0.01}= 56%&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, using quadratic equation to solve this problem is the right choice.

Since phosphoric acid has three acidic protons, the second and third deprotonations may also contribute to pH of the solution.

When phosphoric acid was first deprotonated, the [HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;] concentration was approximately 0.00559 (calculated above). The [HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;] to K&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; ratio is greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. In this case equation (4) can be used to approximate [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] from the second deprotonation. From calculation, 
[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{6.3\times10^{-8}\times 5.59\times 10^{-3}} = 1.87\times 10^{-5}&lt;/math&gt;

As shown from calculation, [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] contribution from the second deprotonation is much less than that from the first, and makes an insignificant change in pH. Similarly, calculations from the third deprotonation reveal that even less [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] (approximately 2.9 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; M) is contributed. As shown by the differing pKa values, the majority of [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] comes from the first deprotonation.

Now consider the multiple deprotonations of sulfuric acid:
     '''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;   &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt;    HSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;           ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = large'''''         (5)
        '''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'''  =  &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{[HSO_4^-][H^+]}{[H_2SO_4]}&lt;/math&gt; 
     '''HSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;   &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt;    SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;           ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;'''''    (6)
        '''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'''  =  &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{[SO_4^{2-}][H^+]}{[HSO_4^-]}&lt;/math&gt;
Equation (5) shows a large value for the first pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, implying that sulfuric acid dissociates completely in the first deprotonation. (See acidic substances) Thus, if we have 0.01 M H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] from the first dissociation would also be 0.01 M. In addition, there would be 0.01 M HSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; in the solution, and is a source of protons by the second deprotonation (equation 6). Before using equation (4), check to see if the concentration of acid to K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; ratio is greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or not. Since this simplification cannot be used, the quadratic equation is used to determine [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] from the second dissociation. The equation is as follows:

:::x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 0.012x - 0.00012 = 0
:Again, &lt;math&gt;x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt; is used to obtain
:: x = 6.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; = [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]
The second deprotonation gives a [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] more than half of which was obtained from the first deprotonation. In contrast to the example with phosphoric acid, the second dissociation of sulfuric acid is contributes greatly to the concentration of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.
In total, [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.01 + 0.065 = 0.0165 M 

The pH = -log 0.0165 = 1.78

Sulfuric acid is a much stronger acid than phosphoric acid as seen by its H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; contribution in each deprotonation step.

==An Alternative Method to the Quadratic Equation==

The quadratic equation can become messy and time consuming in certain situations. Lets consider the following hypothetical situation:

'''HA   &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt;    A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

''K&lt;sub&gt;HA&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;'''''

[HA] = 2

[A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] = 0

[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = 1x10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;

Our equilibrium equation would therefore be:

&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{[A^-][H^+]}{[HA]}&lt;/math&gt; = 6.3x10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;

Now we take into account the overall shift in equilibrium from the dissociation of HA and include the given concentrations.

&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{[x][0.1 + x]}{[2 - x]}&lt;/math&gt; = 6.3x10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;

Because there is already a large concentration of protons in the solution the overall dissociation of HA, given by the variable x, will be very small. Therefore we are going to ignore the change in x in the denominator to yield an equation that is not quadratic.

&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{[x][0.1]}{[2 + x]}&lt;/math&gt; = 6.3x10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;

Solving for x yields approximately 0.11853 which will call x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; which we will use to successively obtain a more accurate number by plugging this number back into our original equation where we ignored x previously:

&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{[x][0.1 + x_n]}{[2 - x]}&lt;/math&gt; = 6.3x10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;

Solving using x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; yield x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be 0.05604

In order to simplify the process the following equation is used to solve for x&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt; derived from our original rate expression.

x&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{0.0126}{x_n + 0.1 + 6.3E-3}&lt;/math&gt;

The following successive approximations are calculated to be:

x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.07761

x&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.06851

x&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.07207

x&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.07063

x&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.07098

x&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.07107

x&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.07103

x&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.07105

When x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; starts repeating itself to a given amount of significant figures, it is safe to assume that the given answer is an accurate approximation and can be used for the final value of x. The overall number of successive approximations that must be calculated varies according to the situation. In some situations it is simpler to use the quadratic equation. An equation that required many successive approximations was used for the purposes of this example. Ingenuity is require to obtain an accurate in a time efficient manner.

==Contribution of Water in Dilute Acidic or Basic Solution==
One more thing we need to consider in case of dilute acid or base is the contribution of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; from water. As we have already known, at 25 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C water molecule could dissociate and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; as well as OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; would form with the amount of 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; M each. For example, if we have 0.0000001 M acetic acid, we can determine the pH of the solution as follows:

Acetic acid is a monoprotic acid which has pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; 1.8 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;. To determine the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; of the solution, let's consider
     '''CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH   &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt;    CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;           ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.8 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;'''''    
        '''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'''  =  &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{[CH_3COO^-][H^+]}{[CH_3COOH]}&lt;/math&gt;
Regarding the previous section, we need quadratic equation to solve this problem, Thus
:::x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 0.000018x - 0.0000000000018 = 0
Then, we get x = 1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; = [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]
the concentration of [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] from 0.0000001 M acetic acid is nearly close to the ones obtained from water. In this case, we have to take into account the [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] from water. Therefore,
:::: [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt; = 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; M
Finally, the pH = -log 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; = 6.7

''Remark'' For dilute basic solution, we can evaluate in the similar way.

== pH Scale Diagram ==
[[Image:PH scale 2.png|500px|border|A pH scale]]	

The scale is broken up into two regions: acidic (pH 0-7) and basic (pH 7-14) with a pH of 7 being said to be &quot;neutral.&quot; Some acidic substances are gastric acid (pH ~ 2), vinegar (pH ~ 3) and coffee (pH ~ 5). Some basic substances are hand soap (pH ~ 10), ammonia (pH ~ 13), and lye (pH ~ 14). An example of a &quot;neutral&quot; substance would be pure water (pH ~ 7).  pH values below 0 require measurements using specialized equipment.  The reason is that typical pH measurements are done in an aqueous solution, which means that the measured pH will only be as strong as the weakest acid in solution (in this case H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; which has a pKa of 0).  Therefore, measurements are typically made by calibrating with a strong acid like sulfuric acid.  Similar arguments also apply for extremely strong bases.

==Acidic Substances==

There are three definitions of acids based on Arrhenius, Bronsted-Lowry, and Lewis. By Arrhenius theory, acids are molecules that produce hydronium ions (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;small&gt;+&lt;/small&gt;) in aqueous solution. The Bronsted-Lowry definition of an acid is a molecule that can donate protons (H&lt;small&gt;+&lt;/small&gt;). A Lewis acid is defined as a molecule that is able to accept electron pairs.

The most common strong acids include hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrobromic acid (HBr), hydroiodic acid (HI), sulfuric acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), perchloric acid (HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and nitric acid (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Where perchloric acid is the strongest with a pKa = -10
In calculations, strong acids are assumed to dissociate completely.
For example: By convention 2.5 M HCl produces 2.5&amp;nbsp;mol of hydronium  ions per liter.

==Basic Substances==
[[Image:Weak.png|right|100px|thumb|Titration of a weak acid and strong acid with a strong base]]

Just as there are three definitions of acids, there are three corresponding definitions of bases. An Arrhenius base is defined as a molecule that produces hydroxide ions (&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;OH) in water. A Bronsted-Lowry base is a molecule able to accept hydrogen ions. Finally, a Lewis base is able to donate electron pairs.

Bases are usually characterized by having a negative charge (surplus of electron pairs), which according the to Lewis theory makes it capable of donating to another molecule. Bases can also have a neutral charge, but contain a lone pair of electrons (such as ammonia) which can be donated to other molecules.

Common strong bases include: Lithium hydroxide (LiOH), Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), Rubidium hydroxide (RbOH), Cesium hydroxide (CsOH), Potassium hydroxide (KOH), Magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) Strontium hydroxide (Sr(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) Barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).
A strong base, like a strong acid, is defined as a compound that dissociates completely in aqueous solution.

==Application in Biochemistry==

pH range for amino acids have Zwitterionic structure is 2-9. Below pH 2 the carboxyl group is not dissociated.
Above pH 9,  but amino group is not dissociated. 

===Zwitterion===
[[Image:Zwitterion isoleucine.png|left|95px|thumb|This is a isoleucine's zwitterion ion form]]
Since amino acids have both an acidic carboxylic acid group and a basic amine group, they can be either positively charged, negatively charged, or both at the same time depending on the pH. A zwitterion is a molecule that has both a positively charged group and a negatively charged group at the same time, thus carrying a total net charge of 0. The zwitterion is the most commonly found form of amino acids when the pH is in the neutral range, since in the neutral pH, the basic amine group is protonated (carries a positive charge) and the carboxyl group is deprotonated (carries a negative charge).

===Isoelectric Focusing===

Since animo acids, and therefore proteins, have multiple sites that can be either positive or negative, the total overall charge of a protein depends on the pH. Isoelectic Focusing is a technique where proteins are separated based on the pH at which they become neutrally charged overall. This point is called the pI, or isoelectric point. Isoelectric Focusing is done by loading the sample proteins onto a gel with a pH gradient and then applying an electic current. The proteins will then move across the gel because of the electric current and will stop moving once they reach their pI. Isoelectric focusing can be combined with SDS-PAGE to increase the separation of proteins in a sample, a technique called Two-Dimensional Electrophoresis.

===The Bohr Effect===

Christian Bohr, a Danish physiologist, defined the Bohr effect as the change in binding affinity of oxygen to hemoglobin based on hydrogen ion and carbon dioxide concentrations.  Oxygen has higher affinity when the pH of the blood is high.  CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; exist in the following equilibrium in the blood:

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt; H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

Thus, a change in either concentration will alter the pH.  An increase in carbon dioxide will increase the concentration of hydrogen ions, and therefore lower both the pH and oxygen's affinity for hemoglobin.  This benefits the body because areas that are high in carbon dioxide are likely deficient in oxygen.  The low pH in those areas causes oxygen to diassociate from hemoglobin, releasing it into the body tissues that need it most.

[[Image:Effect of Ph on Hemoglobin's Oxygen Affinity.jpg]]

As the pH increases, so does the ability for hemoglobin to bind oxygen. However, as the pH moves to a lower pH (as slight as a drop from 7.4 to 7.2), the ability to bind to oxygen decreases.

'''Carbon Dioxide'''

Carbon dioxide also affects the pH inside a red blood cell (which affects the ability of oxygen to bind to hemoglobin). As carbon dioxide flows into a red blood cell, carbonic anhydrase (an enzyme specific for this reaction) facilitates its interaction with water in forming carbonic acid, which then dissociates into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. 

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt; H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

The increase in H+ decreases the pH, and stabilizes the T-state of hemoglobin, also known as the deoxygenated state.

The transport of carbon dioxide into a red blood cell is carried through via membrane transport. It also directly interacts with hemoglobin, affected the binding and release of oxygen. The carbon dioxide decreases the oxygen binding affinity and stabilizes the T-state of hemoglobin even better than the effects of pH on oxygen binding. 

'''Carbamate Group'''

Carbamate groups are negatively charged groups formed from the interaction of carbon dioxide and the last amine group in an amino acid. The carbamate groups stabilize the decrease in the binding of oxygen by increasing the salt bridge.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Nature of Dipole Bonding==
[[Image:H2O molecule scheme of dipole.png|right|thumb]]
The nature of dipole bonding begins when atoms differ in their [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronegativity electronegativity], which quantifies an individual atom's ability to attract [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron electrons] to itself. A classic example of an electronegative atom is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorine fluorine].

When a [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Covalent bonds|covalent bond]] forms between two atoms, the electrons will be distributed between the two atoms unequally; the more electronegative atoms will have the larger electron density. This unequal sharing of electrons creates a charge separation, and the molecule under inspection will develop [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_charge partial charges] where the electronegative atom will develop a partial negative charge and its adjacent atom will develop a partial positive charge. The molecule is then said to be [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_density polarized] due to this charge separation. When molecules exhibit this charge separation, there is a pseudo-electrostatic force between the partial charges of molecules.

The key to dipole bonding is charge separation within a molecule.

==Permanent dipole-dipole interactions==
[[Image:Dipole-dipole-interaction-in-HCl-2D.png|right|thumb]]
; Dipole moment : When the covalent bonds in a molecule are polarized so that one portion of the molecule experiences a positive charge and the other portion of the molecule experiences a negative charge. This separation of opposite charges creates an electric dipole. Depending on the orientation of two dipoles, molecules can be attracted to each other as the partial negative charge is attracted to the partial positive charge.

*Ex. Carbon Monoxide (CO)

The permanent and induced dipole interaction of nonpolar molecules bonded to nonpolar molecules in polar molecules, which forms more stable structure.

Besides, when the polar molecules lie near one another, as in liquids and solids, their partial charges act as tiny electric fields that orient them and give rise to dipole-dipole forces. So, the dipole-dipole forces is the positive pole of one molecule that attracts the negative pole of another. The greater the dipole moment, the greater the dipole-dipole forces between the molecules are.

==Induced dipole interactions==

Induced dipoles occur due to the fact that electrons are in constant motion within a molecule. For nonpolar molecules, the averaged charge distribution within a molecule would suggest that there is no permanent dipole. However, instantaneous charge distributions indicate the presence of a transient dipole. Imagine that if you take a photograph of a molecule, you can see an electron and a nucleus in a fixed arrangement. This fixed arrangement implies that there is a dipole moment, if only for a brief moment. We call this type of instantaneous dipole an induced dipole. Brief partial negative charges will be attracted to brief partial positive charges.

Induced dipoles are typical of nonpolar molecules such as fatty acid chains, aliphatic chains, and aromatic hydrocarbons.

===Hydrophobic interactions===
; Hydrophobic effect : When nonpolar molecules clump together when surrounded by polar molecules.

*The nonpolar molecules are not held together by bonds which is why it is called an induced dipole-dipole interaction. This phenomenon is due to the reduction of the number of water molecules surrounded the hydrophobic portion of molecules. 
 
; clathrate : The structure that is formed when [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrophobic interaction|hydrophobic interactions]] take place (when the hydrophilic molecules line the outside of the hydrophobic molecules). This forces the hydrophobic molecules to become highly ordered

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Osmosis==
The tendency for aqueous solutions [solvents] to migrate across a semi-permeable membrane from a higher water potential to a lower water potential is known as '''diffusion'''. Semi-permeable membranes are selective, allowing only specific particles to flow through and preventing others from invading. Water always flows from lower solute concentration [dilute solution] to higher solute concentration until a balance is produced. Dilute solutions are highly concentrated in water and low in solute. Hence, a low concentration of solute results in a high water potential. The general motion is from more water to less water or from less solute to more solute. 

[[Image:Osmose en.svg|400px]]

- See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_potential Water Potential] for more information.

=== Osmotic pressure ===
[[File:Osmotic pressure.PNG|thumb|Physical meaning of osmotic pressure, Π]]
During osmosis, pressure is generated due to the difference in solute potentials of two environments separated by a semi-permeable membrane. This pressure provides the force for the water to move from low solute concentration to high solute concentration. Once the water pressure reaches the osmotic pressure, osmosis stops. The osmotic pressure is measured by the van't Hoff equation: ''Π = icRT'', where &quot;''ic''&quot; represents osmolarity. Osmolarity is a product of the molar concentration of solute and the van't Hoff factor, ''i'', a measurement of the extent of dissociation of the solute. The van't Hoff factor is equal to how many particles the solute dissociates in to. For example, NaCl dissociates into Na+ and Cl-, so the van't Hoff factor is 2. Glucose does not dissociate, so it's van't Hoff factor is 1. If there are multiple solutes, the total osmolarity is equal to the sum of the osmolarities of the individual solutes. &lt;ref name=&quot;Principles of Biochemistry, Lehninger and Nelson, chapter 2&quot; /&gt;

=== Reverse Osmosis ===
Reverse osmosis is the process by which excess pressure is placed on one end of a semipermeable barrier in order to drive a solution from an area of high solute concentration to that of a low solute concentration. Opposite from general osmosis, the solvent does not go down a concentration gradient. In this case, the cell membrane serves as a filter. However, the key difference between osmosis and filtration is that in reverse osmosis, separation is done by diffusive mechanisms rather than size exclusion or staining. Reverse osmosis has been used industrially for water treatment. Salt water collected from the ocean is transformed to pure water by setting an external pressure equal to the air pressure at sea level. Water purification is only one industrial use of reverse osmosis. Metals and chemicals are also recycled through this process.

Example of the environmental use of reverse osmosis:

== Types of Tonicity ==
[[Image:tinoisotonic.jpg|thumb|'''Zero net movement of water in isotonic environment''']]

=== Isotonic ===
*The scenario when the solute concentration inside and outside of a cell (or semi-permeable membrane) is in equilibrium. There is no net movement of water if the cell is in the isotonic environment. Since there is equilibrium between the water inside and outside the cell, no net movement of water occurs.

=== Hypertonic ===
*When the solute concentration outside of a cell is higher than the solute concentration inside of a cell. Hence the cell shrinks since the water from inside of the cell rushes outside of the cell in order to equilibrate the solute concentrations inside and outside of the cell. Fish such as salmon have to excrete salt from their gills to prevent themselves from being in a hypertonic solution.

[[Image:hypertonic.jpg|thumb|'''Water moves from inside the cell to outside of the cell''']]

=== Hypotonic ===
*When the solute concentration outside of a cell is lower than the solute concentration inside of a cell. Hence the cell swells because the water from outside of the cell flows inside of the cell in order to make the solute concentrations equal. This may cause the cell to burst. To prevent bursting, cells have developed mechanisms to cope with its environment. Freshwater protists that inhabit hypotonic environments have organelles such as contractive vacuoles to pump water out from the cell. For bacteria and plants, a plasma membrane is surrounded by a rigid and non-expandable cell wall that has the strength to resist osmotic pressure and prevent osmotic lysis. Lastly, for multi-cellular animals to prevent bursting, blood plasma and interstitial fluid are used to maintain the osmolarity level close to that of cytosol.

[[Image:hypotonic.jpg|thumb|'''Water moves from outside the cell to inside of the cell''']]


== The Role of Osmosis in Living Organisms ==
Living cells may be thought of as microscopically small bags of solutions contained within semi permeable membrane that allows water to flow in or out. In order for the cell to survive, the concentration of solutes within the cell cannot be changed dramatically. Water passes through the membrane in both directions to generate equilibrium between the cell and its surroundings. If the cells are in a highly concentrated solution, the water in the cell would flow out to maintain the equilibrium between the exterior and interior of the cell. This may cause the cell to shrink due to loss of water and die of dehydration. Oppositely, if the cells are in a more diluted solution, water will enter the cell and cause it to burst and be destroyed.
In the molecular level, storage cells maintain osmotic pressures by storing energy in forms of macromolecules, such as polysaccharides, rather than micro molecules, such as glucose. By storing macromolecules, the osmotic pressures are diminished, thus preventing storage cells from bursting. The reason behind this is that osmolarity depends on the amount of solutes in the cell rather than the solute's size and mass. Therefore, the storage of macromolecules prevents a dramatic increase in osmotic pressure.

To survive through harsh conditions in nature, organisms have developed various methods to maintain their solute concentration within safe levels. For example, organisms that live in saltwater have much higher cell solute concentrations than organisms living in fresh water; other animals replace lost water and solutes by drinking and eating, or by removing the excessive water/solutes to decrease the solute concentration through excretion of urine.

Osmosis also plays an important role in plants. It contributes to the movement of water through parts of the plant. As the minerals and other solutions from soil are taken up by root cells to leaf cells, the solute concentrations in the plant cell will increase. It brings the differences of osmotic pressure between the cell and the exterior environment. As a result, water will be drawn upward and spread through the plants cell. When too much water is taken up into the cells, water is evaporated from leaves by regulating the size of the openings in the leaf surfaces to remove the excess water. In addition, osmolarity plays a role in plant rigidity. In a plant cell, the vacuole holds much of the plant volume and solute concentration. Because of this high solute concentration, the osmotic pressure causes water to enter the vacuole. However, because of the immutable cell wall, the cells do not burst from such a hypotonic solution. Instead, the cell stiffens, thus increasing the rigidity of the plant and its tissues.

== The Role of Osmosis in Studying Organelles == 
Within the cell, there are organelles that have semipermeable membranes that allow the intake and output of water. Naturally, these organelles, such as mitochondria, chloroplasts, and lysosomes, exist in the cytoplasm where the solute concentration is higher. Keeping that in mind, in order to study organelles and isolate them from the cell, precautions must be taken in order to create an isotonic solution and prevent the organelles from absorbing too much water and bursting. Processes such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification/Differential Centrifugation| Differential Centrifugation]] depend on this precaution in order to obtain successful separation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Isoelectric Focusing==
Isoelectric focusing or also called the pI of the protein is the pH at which its net charge is zero. A separation technique which separates peptides according to how acidic and basic their residues are. A gel with a [[Structural Biochemistry/pH|pH]] gradient is used as the medium. The pH gradient is made by adding polyampholytes, which are multi-charged polymers, with different pI into the gel.  Then the sample is put onto the gel and a voltage is applied. The proteins will move along the gel until they reach their isoelectric points. In other words, each protein will move until it reaches a position in the gel at which the pH is equal to the pI of the protein. a protein band that forms at a given pH can then be removed and analyzed further. This process can successfully separate proteins that have a difference in net charge greater than or equal to 1. 

Isoelectric point (pI): The pH at which the net charge on the [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]] is zero. For a protein with many basic [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acid]] pI will be high, while for an acidic protein the pI will be lower.
 
Isoelectric focusing is a type of zone electrophoresis, and it is usually performed in a gel, that takes advantage of the fact that a molecule's charge changes with the pH of its surroundings. A protein that is in a pH region below its isoelectric point (pI) will be positively charged and so will migrate towards the cathode. As it migrates, however, the charge will decrease until the protein reaches the pH region that corresponds to its pI. At this point it has no net charge and so migration ceases. As a result, the proteins become focused into the sharp stationary bands with each protein positioned at a point in the pH gradient corresponding to its pI. This technique is capable of extremely high resolution with proteins differing by a single charge being fractionated into separate bands.


Molecules to be focused are distributed over a medium that has a pH gradient (usually created by aliphatic ampholytes). An electric current is passed through the medium, creating a &quot;positive&quot; anode and &quot;negative&quot; cathode end. The negatively charged molecules migrate through the pH gradient in the medium toward the &quot;positive&quot; end while positively charged molecules move toward the &quot;negative&quot; end. As a particle moves towards the pole opposite of its charge it moves through the changing pH gradient until it reaches a point in which the pH of that molecules isoelectric point is reached. At this point the molecule no longer has a net electric charge (due to the protonation or deprotonation of the associated functional groups) and as such will not proceed any further within the gel. The gradient is initially established before adding the particles of interest by first subjecting a solution of small molecules such as polyampholytes with varying pI values to electrophoresis.

[[Image:Isoelectric_focusing_contribute2.jpg |600px|Isoelectric Focusing]]

The method is applied in the study of proteins, which separate based on their relative content of acidic and basic residues, whose value is represented by the pI. Proteins are introduced into an immobilized pH gradient gel composed of polyacrylamide, starch, or agarose where a pH gradient has been established. Isoelectric focusing can resolve proteins that differ in pI value by as little as 0.01. Isoelectric focusing is the first step in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, in which proteins are first separated by their pI and then further separated by molecular weight through [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification/SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis|SDS PAGE]].

==How to determine pI of amino acid==
We can determine pI of each amino acid when we know its pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;s by titration with NaOH. For example, glycine, the smallest amino acid, has two pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values, which are 2.34 and 9.60, respectively.[http://philomath.exteen.com/images/11-20/18.jpg]

First, add strong acid and let glycine to become complete protonated form. Then gradually add NaOH until pH raises up to 2.34. At this point, we use 0.5 mol of NaOH equivalent to first protonated form of glycine. Also, There would be 0.5 mol of second protonated form generated in the solution. After using 1 mol NaOH equivalent to first pronated form, there would be solely second pronated form. We'll see that second protonated form of glycine is zwitterion, which is zero net charge molecule. Therefore pH at this point is called isoeletric point (pI) and equals 5.97. Continue adding NaOH once pH equals 9.60. At this point, 0.5 mol of third protonated form is present in the solution and total amount of NaOH is 1.5 mol. Back to pI, we see that 
::: &lt;math&gt;pI = \frac{2.34 + 9.60}{2}= 5.97&lt;/math&gt;

Then we can write in the general form: 
                    &lt;math&gt;pI = \frac{pK_{a1} + pK_{a2}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

''Remark'' To determine pI of amino acid which has more than two pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, we'll use two pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values covering the range in which zwitterion would present in the solution.[http://faculty.une.edu/com/courses/bionut/distbio/obj-512/Chap6-titration-lysine.gif]</text>

      <comment>/* Ionic bond energy */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:IonicBondingRH11.png|thumb|NaCl forming an Ionic Bond.png]]
An Ionic Bond is a specific type of chemical bond formed between a &quot;metal&quot; and a &quot;nonmetal.&quot; &quot;Metals&quot; involved in ionic bonds are usually the Alkali and Alkaline-Earth metals - also known as the first two columns on the period table - as well as several transition state metals. The non-metals usually involved in the ionic bonds are the halogens. 

The goal of forming chemical bonds is to have an octet. &quot;Octet&quot; means that an element has eight electrons. Another way of putting this phenomenon is to state that each element wants to have the electron configuration of a noble gas. For the non-metals, the goal is to achieve the electron configuration of the noble gas in the same row. For the metals, the goal is to have the electron configuration of the noble gas in the row directly preceding it. For example, chlorine wants the electron configuration of Argon while sodium wants that of Neon. Ionic bonds help achieve the octet because the metal effectively transfers its valence electrons to the nonmetal. In this way, both metal and nonmetal achieve noble-gas electron configurations. 

However, pure ionic bonds do not exist. There is a level of covalent-bond character in each ionic bond. However, as a general rule of thumb, the larger the electronegativity difference between the metal and nonmetal, the more ionic the bond, and therefore, less covalent the bond. Electronegativity is the ability to draw electron density while in the presence of another atom. The more electronegative the atom, the greater its ability to pull electron density towards itself. 

'''Electrostatic interactions''', also known as '''Charge-charge interactions''' and '''Ionic interactions.&quot;&quot;&quot; An '''electrostatic attraction''' exist when there are closely packed ions of opposite charges. An '''electrostatic repulsion''' present between different ions that have the same charge.

==Coulomb's Law==

The '''force''' between two-points charges can be calculated by '''Coulomb’s law''',

&lt;big&gt;F&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1on2&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;big&gt;F&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2on1&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;big&gt;'''k'''q&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;big&gt;q&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;big&gt;/r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

In other words, the bond energy is directly proportional to the charges of the two atoms and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two atoms. F has the unit '''N''' (Newtons), r is the distance between the center of the two-point charges in meter, q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the charge (in C, Coulombs) of each atom respectively. '''k''' is the constant, approximately equal &lt;math&gt;9.00 x 10^9&lt;/math&gt; N•m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;•C&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. If force is negative ('''F &lt; 0'''), it represents the existence of attraction since the only possible way to have F smaller than zero is the sign of q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are different, or opposite. Meaning the sign of charges for this two atoms are opposite. In other words, if the force is positive ('''F &gt; 0'''), it means the two charged atoms repel each other, for the same sign of charges (both positive or negative charges.)

==Ionic bond energy==

The '''ionic bond energy''' between two-points charges can be calculated using the formula of electrical potential energy,

&lt;big&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;ele&lt;/sub&gt;= Kq&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;big&gt;q&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;big&gt;/r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

In other words, the bond energy is directly proportional to the charges of the two atoms and inversely proportional to the distance (bond length in microscopic level) between the two charged atoms. U&lt;sub&gt;ele&lt;/sub&gt; has the unit '''J''' (Joules), r is the distance between the ion centers in nanometers, and q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the numerical ion charges. K is the constant, approximately equal &lt;math&gt;2.31 x 10&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt; J•nm. It is also equal to '''k'''Q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; x 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; (Conversion to nanomemter, nm) or Q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/4'''&lt;math&gt;\pi\epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt;''' x 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; where '''k''' is approximately equal to &lt;math&gt;9.00 x 10^9&lt;/math&gt; Nm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; and Q is equal to the charge of a proton, &lt;math&gt;1.60 x 10&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt;C; '''&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt;''' approximately equal to &lt;math&gt;8.85 x 10&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;•m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; or F•m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, representing the permittivity of free space.

==Lattice Energy==
&lt;ref&gt;Silberberg, Martin S.(2010). Principles of General Chemistry (2nd Edition).McGraw Hill Publishing Company. ISBN 978-0-07-351108-05&lt;/ref&gt;
Lattice energy (ΔH&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;lattice&lt;/sub&gt;) is the released energy from the interaction between ions. The positive sign of this energy indicates that the energy is needed for ions to form a solid. On the other hand, the negative sign of the energy indicates that the energy is needed for ionic solids to be separated into its gaseous ions. In addition, ionic interactions can be explained based on the lattice energy because the qualitative number of the energy indicates the ions' hardness, solubility, and melting point. Lattice energy can be predicted based on the effect of ionic size and ionic change. As one goes down the periodic table, the ionic radius increases. And as the radius increases, there would be a decrease in the electrostatic energy between the positively charged atom and negatively charged atom. As a result, there would be a decrease in the lattice energy. In addition, ionic charge can also determine the lattice energy. A greater amount of energy will be needed to bring a larger charged ions together than to form the smaller charged ions.</text>

'''Puttu''' is a [[Cookbook:breakfast|breakfast]] dish of Kerala. The main ingredients are rice [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] and coconut. It is usually eaten with [[Cookbook:Steaming|steamed]] bananas or [[Cookbook:Cholley|Kadala Curry]] ([[Cookbook:Chickpea|chickpea]] curry) or [[Cookbook:Chicken Curry|Chicken Curry]] or [[Cookbook:Boil|boiled]] green gram ([[Cookbook:Mung Bean|moong]]) and pappad.


== Ingredients==
* Puttu Powder (flour) - 4 cups
* [[Cookbook:Coconut|Coconut]]  - 1 (medium sized)
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]]  - as per taste
* Water  - enough to moisten the flour

== Procedure == 

#Grate the coconut finely. Take the puttu powder in a wide bowl. Add salt and half of the grated coconut. Rub the mixture with finger tips, sprinkling water. The flour should become moist and should have a coarse texture. Leave the mixture for an hour, if the flour is ready made, as it absorbs more water.
#After an hour, check the consistency of the flour. One should be able to make a ball out of the flour, which can be easily crumbled. Adjust the water content accordingly. Spread a little coconut at the bottom of the puttu vessel (puttu kutti) and fill it with the moist flour. Layer it with coconut. Steam it on the puttu vessel or on the pressure cooker nozzle. In a few minutes, steam will start escaping through the top of the puttu vessel. Puttu will be done in 4 minutes.
#Serve hot with kadala curry or boiled green gram and pappad (payarum pappadavum) or with steamed bananas.

Note: [[Cookbook:Rice|Rice]], [[Cookbook:wheat|wheat]], [[Cookbook:corn|corn]], ragi or [[Cookbook:tapioca|tapioca]] flour can be used for making puttu.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== HTTP Request ==

The HttpServletRequest is probably the most important interface in the whole JEE framework. It is the way the user communicates with the server. Each time the user needs something from the server, he sends a request that is converted into an HttpServletRequest object inside the Web Container.

== Details ==

The first thing to notice is that HttpServletRequest extends another interface, the ServletRequest interface. This happens because the web container wasn't designed to handle only HTTP requests and responses, but all kinds of requests, using many kinds of protocols. Though, as said before, HTTP is the most common protocol used, and probably in 100% of the time you'll see only HTTPRequests in and HTTPResponses out. That is why the JEE API has a specific package named &lt;code&gt;javax.servlet.http&lt;/code&gt; that contains all the specific classes and interfaces for the HTTP protocol.

There are many methods inside HttpServletRequest that are very handy to manipulate the user's request. You can get all kinds of information from the object the web container created for you. Some examples include:

* HTTP headers
* Cookies
* Query String
* User's IP and port
* Form parameters
* etc.

== Parameters ==

The most common use for the HttpServletRequest object is to get the parameters sent by the user in HTML forms. Parameters are strings that the server receives from the client for specific tasks, for example: to process a query or to save or update a database record. 

Parameters are sent in two ways: in HTML forms and in the query string. In both ways parameters are values identified by keys. The same key can have more then one value, meaning that the same parameter can be sent twice with two different values. Some valid examples of parameters are:

* name=John
* fname=John&amp;lname=Doe&amp;email=jdoe@gmail.com
* query=java&amp;lang=en
* name=John&amp;name=Mary&amp;name=Josh

When sent in HTML form using the POST method, data is sent in the body of the request and can be of any size. When using GET data is restricted by the maximum size of a URL that can depend on the browser or the server, so it is not recommended to send large amounts of data using get.

Below you can see a little more detailed explanation about HTML Forms and query strings.

=== HTML Form ===

An HTML form is one of the ways the user can send data to the server. As was explained before HTML form can send data in two different ways: POST and GET. It is recommended to use POST if data is being sent to update something in the server, sometimes because it can be a lot of data and others because there can be confidential data that is not going to be encrypted in the URL.

To send a parameter to the server using an HTML form, just name and identify the form subelement with the name you want and get it by name in the server. A very simple example of that would be a user sending this form:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;form method=&quot;POST&quot; action=&quot;someUrl.do&quot;&gt;
    What is your name?&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;name&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; /&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

That would render something like this:

[[Image:HTMLForm.PNG|Simple HTML form]]

Then a servlet could receive the HttpServletRequest with the parameter and print back a ''hello'' message:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
package org.wikibooks.scwcd;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.PrintWriter;

import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {

    public void doPost (HttpServletRequest request, 
            HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException, ServletException {
        
        String name = request.getParameter(&quot;name&quot;);
        if (name != null) {
            PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
            out.println(&quot;Hello &quot; + name + &quot;!&quot;);
            out.flush();
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This would result in a page showing the message &quot;Hello [user name]!&quot;.

To see all parameters being received by the server, the following Servlet can be used:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
package org.wikibooks.scwcd;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.PrintWriter;

import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

public class EchoParameters extends HttpServlet {

    public void doPost (HttpServletRequest request, 
            HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException, ServletException {
                PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
		out.println(&quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;All parameters:&lt;ul&gt;&quot;);
		Enumeration params = request.getParameterNames();
		String name;
		while (params.hasMoreElements()) {
			name = (String)params.nextElement();
			out.println(&quot;&lt;li&gt;Key : &quot; + name + &quot;&lt;br /&gt;Values: &lt;ul&gt;&quot;);
			for (String value : request.getParameterValues(name)) {
				out.println(&quot;&lt;li&gt;&quot; + value + &quot;&lt;/li&gt;&quot;);
			}
			out.println(&quot;&lt;/ul&gt;&quot;);
		}
		
		out.println(&quot;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;);
		out.flush();
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Query String ===

The query string is a string with a specific format appended at the end of the URL. The string can be appended after a question mark sign (&lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;) and contains key/values separated by ampersand signs (&lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;). A simple example would be &lt;code&gt;http://www.google.com/search?q=java&lt;/code&gt; where the query string is &lt;code&gt;q=java&lt;/code&gt;. With that, the server receives a parameter &quot;q&quot; with value &quot;java&quot;, meaning that the URL is a '''q'''uery into the &lt;code&gt;search&lt;/code&gt; resource inside the &lt;code&gt;google.com&lt;/code&gt; domain (server).

To send values in the query string just use the method &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; in an HTML form as explained above.

Browsers will automatically encode the URL to correctly be interpreted by the server, because there are special symbols that cannot be sent directly, like &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt;. Some of these symbols are used for special purposes and must not be used in keys or values in query strings, so they must be encoded, otherwise the URL will be misinterpreted by the server and the query string can be corrupted. [[http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/html/topics/urlencoding.htm 2]] [[http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/ref_urlencode.asp 3]].

Query strings are good to save an application state: somewhere the user was or something he did that can be bookmarked for later access. But one thing to remember is that, because they can be saved, confidential data like credit card numbers must not be in the query string.

== HTTP Headers ==

HTTP headers are protocol specific commands that the client (most of the times a browser) and the server uses to check what each other wants and how they are expecting to receive the answer. A very simple way to get access to a header is using the &lt;code&gt;HttpServletRequest.getHeader(String)&lt;/code&gt; method. It will return a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; that represents the value of the header received by the server for a specific header.

The following example shows how a servlet could send back as HTML all the headers received from the client:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
package org.wikibooks.scwcd;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.util.Enumeration;

import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

public class HttpHeadersExample extends HttpServlet {

	public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
			throws ServletException, IOException {
		
		Enumeration names = request.getHeaderNames();
		String value = null, name = null;
		
		PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
		
		out.println(&quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&quot;);
		out.println(&quot;&lt;p&gt;All HTTP Headers:&lt;ul&gt;&quot;);
		
		while (names.hasMoreElements()) {
			name = (String) names.nextElement();
			value = request.getHeader(name);
			out.println(&quot;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot; + name + &quot;&lt;/strong&gt;: &quot; + value + &quot;&lt;/li&gt;&quot;);
		}
		out.println(&quot;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;);
		out.flush();
	}
}
&lt;/source&gt;

That would result in the following HTML code, for a specific browser:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All HTTP Headers:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;host&lt;/strong&gt;: localhost:8080&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;user-agent&lt;/strong&gt;: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; pt-BR; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;accept&lt;/strong&gt;: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;accept-language&lt;/strong&gt;: en-us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;accept-encoding&lt;/strong&gt;: gzip,deflate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;accept-charset&lt;/strong&gt;: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;keep-alive&lt;/strong&gt;: 300&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;connection&lt;/strong&gt;: keep-alive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Protein studies involves various step of sample preparation. The main protocols of protein studies are as followed:
# Protein Synthesis
# Purification
# Evaluation of purified protein
# Determination of Amino Acid Sequence
# Calculation of Protein's Mass
# Determination of Protein's 3-D Structure

There are many methods used to study proteins, including its shape and structure. For instance, X-Ray crystallography is used to give scientists the structure of the protein. Such information is used extensively in determining the characteristics of the protein as well as how it functions and under which circumstances. Other methods used includes amino acid sequencing, fluorescence microscopy, mass spectrometry, NMR, etc. 

=Carbohydrate-Binding Proteins=
Carbohydrate-Binding proteins (CBPs) are identified as important mediators for numerous different types of cellular events through interactions between carbohydrates and proteins. There are three main families of CBPs.
# the C-type lectin family (including the Selectins)
# the Siglec family
# the galectin family

==C-type Lectins (including Selectins)==
C-type Lectins and selectins are present in humans and murines (household rats and mice). Roles of these specific CBPs include
*promoting primary immune response
*mediating leukocyte trafficking to sites of inflammation
*mediating lymphocyte recirculation
*mediating platelet binding to neutrophils

===Clinical Use of Lectins===
Pure forms of lectins are used for blood typing. Specifically, lectins are used to identify some glycolipids and glycoproteins on an individual's red blood cells.
In the brain, PHA-L, a lectin from a kidney bean, helps to trace the path of efferent axons through the anterograde labeling method.
[[Image:Phytohemagglutinin L.png|frame|PHA-L]]

==Siglecs==
Siglecs occur mostly in humans, but some are also found in murines.
Some of the primary roles of these CBPs are:
*regulator in B cell activation
*maintenance of myelin
*inhibitor of axonal growth

==Galectins==
Galectins are also found in humans, mice, and rats as well. These CBPs are abundant in most organs such as muscles, hearts, lung, liver, lymph nodes, thymus, and colon, stomach epithelial cells, gastrointestimal, erythroctyes, skin, brain, Hodgkin's lymphoma, kidney, and lens. Roles include:
*acting as a marker for cell recognition
*binding specificity

      <text xml:space="preserve">After each purification steps, the types of [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]] that exist in the in the solution is expected to decrease while its specific activity is expected to increase. These two qualities are desirable because experiment done using a pure protein sample gives a more quantifiable result. One method used to check the purity of the sample is using a form of Gel Electrophoresis, such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification/SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis|SDS PAGE]] or native PAGE. 

Purification can also be quantitatively evaluated by measuring total protein, total activity, specific activity, yield and purification level. Total protein is the quantity of protein present in a fraction and can be determined by measuring the protein concentration of a part of each fraction and multiplying by the fraction's total volume. Total activity is measured by the enzymatic activity in the volume of fraction used in the assay multiplied by the fraction's total volume.  Specific activity is the total activity divided by total protein.  The yield is the amount of activity retained after each purification step.  The purification level is the increase of purity which can be measured after each purification step by dividing its specific activity by the specific activity of the initial extract.

a good purification takes into account both purification levels of yield. A high amount of purification and a poor yield give little protein to work with. on the other hands, a low purification and a high yield give contaminated protein in the experiment.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== General information ==
'''Gel electrophoresis''' is a technique used to display and assert that the [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification|purification]] scheme was effective by measuring the number of different proteins in a mixture. The basis of gel electrophoresis is the fact that molecule with specific net charge will move through an electric field. The speed of protein migration can be quantified as:
&lt;big&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v = Ez/f&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

With ''E'' as magnitude of the electric field, ''z'' as net charge of a protein, and ''f'' as frictional kinetic coefficient. 


Frictional coefficient, for spherical molecule, is determined as:

''&lt;big&gt;f = 6 &amp;pi; &amp;eta; r&lt;/big&gt;''

with &amp;eta; as viscosity.


As its equation implies, the velocity of molecule traveling in the gel matrix depends on its size, shape, and the charge that it has. The smaller the molecule, the faster it will travel. Furthermore, Gels can be made in a variety of wt percents: 6%, 8%, 10%, 12% and 15%. Higher percentages are used primarily for smaller molecules and smaller percentages are used for larger sized samples. Theoretically, larger molecules can still be used with higher percents, but these gels may take a long time to develop. Charge can also be a factor in the speed and distance that a specific sample travels through the gel. Using a higher voltage will send the samples farther and faster. However, caution must be used with higher voltages as the heat it generates may melt the gels.

Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE; SDS-polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis) is a powerful tool to check the purity of the sample because because it can detect minuscule amount of protein. Different proteins appear as different bands on SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel after gel has been stained with Coomassie blue (visualize ~2pm of protein) or silver stain (visualize 0.02 &amp;micro;g of protein).

== Native Gel Electrophoresis  ==
Native Gel Electrophoresis involves running gels with samples in its native state. In doing so, the charge of the molecule becomes a factor in addition to size. More specifically, more charged molecules will migrate faster and farther than less charged molecules of comparable mass. Likewise, larger molecules will migrate less and at slower speeds than another molecule of comparable charge.  Native Gel Electrophoresis most often involves two types of gels - Agarose and Polyacrylamide. Agarose is a derivative of the cell membranes of red algae composed of polysaccharides agarose and agaropectin, and due to the larger size of the pores, agarose gels are better suited for protein samples larger than 200 kilodaltons. Polyacrylamide (poly 2-propenamide, is a readily-crosslinked polymer of the neurotoxin acrylamide. It's pores are more fine, and while agarose is most commonly used for most cases, polyacrylamide is the gel of choice for smaller sample masses.

== The Use of SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) ==
[[Image:Sds.png|right|200px]]
[[image:SDS-PAGE.jpg|200px|thumbnail|SDS Page. The Molecular Marker is located in the left lane.]]

Electrophoresis involves the movement of particles due to electric current on the basis of size, charge of molecules, amount of current, etc. S[[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification/SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis|SDS PAGE]] is a technique used to separate proteins based on size, and size alone.  Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is a detergent that binds to proteins at every 2 amino acids in its sequence, and as SDS is very negative on its own, it changes the overall charge of the molecule to a negative charge. This negative charge is proportional to the protein's mass on the basis that the amount of SDS bound to the molecule is based on how many doublets of amino acids are present. The negative charge put on the protein is much larger than the charge originally there, which allows for a similar charge-to-mass ratio between different proteins. When SDS binds to proteins, it also changes the conformation of the proteins into similar shapes by denaturing the proteins and changing its bonds. SDS allows gel electrophoresis to separate proteins based on their molecular weights since the mass-to-charge ratio is relatively uniform among the proteins. This is because the SDS gel has sieving properties (offers resistance to particles based on their size)and is a uniform environment. It increases the differential mobility. The mobility of these proteins are then linearly proportional to the logarithm of their mass. Using this information, we can conclude from their mobility the mass of the protein and can even distinguish proteins that have a 2% difference in mass. Thus, the largest molecules, the ones that have more SDS bound to them, will fall down the electric field slower than the ones that have a smaller mass, and less SDS bound to them. This principle is contrary to the one in size-exclusion (gel-filtration) chromatography, which causes heavier molecules to come down first while the lighter ones come out later. 

Certain solvents, such as PEG, glycerol, ethanol, and isopropanol, have an effect of decreasing the hydrodynamic radius of the proteins by decreasing the amount of free water to provide hydration spheres for the proteins. The polar solvents will hydrogen bond with the water, decreasing the disorder around the proteins and as a result, reducing the size of the hydration sphere. In such case, proteins will be eluted at a later stage as if they were of smaller size. 

After the process is complete, the proteins are stained with a dye, forming bands, which represent the layers of mobility of each protein. With each additional purification process, the electrophoresis yields less bands, but a single darker band, which consequently represents the increased presence of the protein being isolated.

== Two-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis ==
The separation techniques of SDS-PAGE and isoelectric focusing can be utilized in conjunction to allow for 2DGE, which employs higher resolution and sensitivity in the separation of proteins. The first dimension of this powerful technique is isoelectric focusing (IEF) and the second dimension is polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). In the first dimension, proteins are separated according to their isoelectric point (pI). To do so, the gel is applied to the top of an SDS-polyacrylamide slab. Electrophoresis is then applied horizontally across the top of the gel and the proteins migrate into the second-dimension gel. Electrophoresis will then be applied again, this time vertically across the gel slab, and the proteins will migrate based on their molecular size. Heavier proteins will move shorter distances. Conversely, lighter proteins will move further.

While Two-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis is a powerful technique that presents a higher resolution of separation, it does have its own limitations. 2DGE is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, requiring manual gel polymerization, staining, and hours upon hours of separation. Furthermore, the technique is not without risk. Because heating of the gel may cause warping and diffusion of the molecules on the gel surface, 2DGE is difficult to reproduce.

==Gel Electrophoresis in DNA Fingerprinting ==
[[image:Pcr_fingerprint.png|200px|thumbnail| DNA Fingerprint.  Each sample has a different pattern of bands indicating these samples are from three different individuals.]]
DNA fingerprinting is a technique used to differentiate between different organisms based on the differences between each organism’s DNA configuration.  DNA fingerprinting is often used by forensics labs to identify criminals by comparing a suspect’s DNA to the DNA found at a crime scene.  DNA from the suspect is run through a gel electrophoresis and compared  to a sample of DNA that was found at the scene.  If the two samples produce identical  band patterns in the gel, then confirmation that the suspect was at the scene of the crime can be made, since no two people possess identical patterns in their DNA.  

In order to perform a fingerprint, a sample containing DNA must be obtained from each organism under evaluation.  Examples of DNA samples include blood, urine, saliva, skin or hair.  Before the samples can be analyzed, they must first be prepared. Preparation includes using restriction enzymes to separate the DNA into smaller pieces.  Restriction enzymes are enzymes that cut DNA strands at specific nucleotides.  These nucleotides are called restriction sites, and  typically mark the end of a 4-8 unit sequence in nucleotides.  The components and length of each restriction sequence vary from person to person, thus the use of restriction enzymes is an efficient way of separating an organism’s DNA into unique and specific sections. Additionally, certain amount of chemicals are also inserted as dye into the gel which will illuminate under UV light. This causes the bands to be much more visible when analyzing the sample protein.

Regions of DNA that contain  many different short repeated sequences are called microsatellites.  The lengths of these microsatellites vary greatly from person to person, which makes them prime locations for restriction enzymes to fragment the DNA.   After treating the  DNA samples with restriction enzymes, the  DNA is now ready to be analyzed.  The samples are loaded into the wells in a slab of gel, and an electric current is applied.  Smaller fragments of DNA run through the gel faster, and will therefore be closer to the bottom, while larger fractions remain closer to the top.  If two samples of DNA are run at the same time, the locations of the bands can be compared.  If the patterns of bands between the two samples are identical, it means that the restriction enzymes partitioned each sample’s DNA at the same locations, indicating the two DNA samples had  identical nucleotide sequencing.  Identical nucleotide sequencing reveals the two samples are from the same organism.

DNA fingerprinting is also a useful technique to determine whether or not two people are related.  Although no two people share the same DNA patterns, sections of microsatellites are passed down from parent to child.  Not all of these sections are passed down, but offspring do not contain any pattern that their parents did not possess.  A paternity or maternity test can be performed by comparing the DNA fingerprint of the individuals in question. If there are large groups of patterns that repeat in each sample’s fingerprint, it is likely that the individuals are related.  The embedded image contains a three different DNA fingerprints, as indicated by the three different patterns of bands.  Although these patterns represent fingerprints from different people, sample 2 shares similar patterns with both 1 and 3, which indicates that the person whose DNA is represented by sample 2 is likely to be the child of sample 1 and 3.  

Maternal and paternal DNA fingerprinting tests are used to determine the probability of two people being related.  These tests do not give definitive answers, and are not foolproof.

== Visualization of protein in gels ==
As most proteins are not directly visible on gels to the naked eye, a method has to be employed in order to visualize them following electrophoresis. The most commonly used protein stain is the dye Coomassie brilliant blue. After electrophoresis, the gel containing the separated proteins is immersed in an acidic alcoholic solution of the dye. This denatures the proteins, fixes them in the gel so that they do not wash out, and allows the dye to bind to them. After washing away excesse dye, the proteins are visible as discrete blue bands. As little as 0.1-1.0 µg of a protein in a gel can be visualized using Coomassie brilliant blue. A more sensitive general protein stain involves soaking the gel in a silver salt solution. However, this technique is rather more difficult to apply. If the protein sample is radioactive the proteins cna be visualized indirectly by overlaying the gel with a sheet of X-ray film. With time (hours to weeks depending on the radioactivity of the sample proteins), the radiation emitted will cause a darkening of the film. Upon development of the film the resulting autoradiograph will have darkened areas corresponding to the positions of the radiolabeled proteins.
Another way of visualizing the protein of interest is to use an antibody against the protein in an immunoblot (Western blot). For this techinique, the proteins have to be transferred out of the gel on to a sheet of nitrocellular or nylon membrane. This is accomplished by overlaying the gel with the nitrocellulose then has an exact image of the pattern that was in the gel. The excess binding sites on the nitrocellulose are then blocked with a nonspecific protein solution such as milk powder, before placing the nitrocellulose in a solution cantaining the antibody that recognizes the protein of interest (the primary antibody). After removing excess unbound antibody, the primary antibody that is now specifically bound to the protein of interest is detected with either a radiolabeled, fluorescent or enzyme-coupled secondary antibody. Finally, the secondary antibody is detected either by placing the nitrocellulose against a sheet of X-ray film (if a radiolabeled secondary antibody has been used), by using a fluorescence detector or by adding to the nitrocellulose a solution of a substrate that is converted into a colored insoluble product by the enzyme that is coupled to the secondary antibody.

You only get what you ask for (in capitalism at least); thus, you better know how to express your preferences. Sometimes you might even have to give a reason for them. But don't worry, JP and Liliana tell us how. Furthermore, they talk about the many ways of saying good bye. Our keyphrase is '''tengo sueño''' – I'm sleepy.

Making a phone call in Spanish can be somewhat challenging. (I'll never forget my first phone call in Spanish; that's for sure.) Thus, the information provided by Liliana and JP in this lesson is particular useful. The keywords are: '''está''' – he/she is (in), '''no está''' – he/she is not (in).

Beware! This is the taboo lesson: rents, salaries, politics, religion, sex, and ... mamas! Liliana and JP give invaluable information about US-American and Latin-American culture. The keywords are: '''cara''' – expensive (for feminine nouns) and '''caro''' – expensive (for masculine nouns).

{{SbcIntroductionSpanishPod}}
Here is a true story: the first time I tried to say “cheers” in Spanish, I said “que aproveche,” which means “enjoy your meal” and is just wrong when everyone is drinking instead of eating. Well, it's from our mistakes that we learn. And from JP and Liliana, of course. The keyword of this lesson is: '''felicidades''' – congratulations.

{{SbcIntroductionSpanishPod}}
Don't panic! Take your time with this lesson! Not only are Liliana and JP talking about a lot of numbers but also about times and hours — including the funny 24-hour system. We learn that JP doesn't like it and even Liliana seems to get it wrong at one point. Anyway, the key phrases are: '''¿Qué hora es?''' – What time is it? and '''¡Apúrate!''' – Hurry up!

{{SbcIntroductionSpanishPod}}
The most important thing about jet-lag: there is good jet-lag (when the local time is behind your time because you were flying westwards) and bad jet-lag (when the local time is ahead of your time because you were flying eastwards). Similarly, our keyword has multiple meanings: '''cambio de horario''' – change of schedule/change of time zone/jet-lag.

&lt;big&gt;'''Vagina'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Vaginal Cuff Dehiscence After Hysterectomy==
*Rare event, reported at 0.1-0.3% after total hysterectomy
**Total laparoscopic hysterectomy appears to have higher rate (~5%) than total abdominal hysterectomy (~0.1%) or total vaginal hysterectomy (~0.3%)
*Predisposition
**Premenopausal women: Vaginal cuff infections or wound hematomas
**Post-menopausal women: Vaginal surgery for genital prolapse or complicated pelvic operations
**High-grade enterocele, vaginal vault prolapse and severe cuff atrophy contribute to the weakening of the vaginal apex
**Cuff radiation may compromise tissue vascularity and weaken the vaginal apex
*Triggers
**Physical triggers: Intercourse, other sexual practices, ''vaginal brachytherapy''
**Pressure triggers: Valsalva (coughing, straining to pass stool)
**Spontaneous: Even many years after hysterectomy
*Signs and symptoms
**Pelvic pain
**Vaginal bleeding
**Egress of abdominal or pelvic viscera
**A variety of other small-bowel symptoms
**Severity of symptoms related to elapsed time between event and presentation 
*Extruded body parts
**Small bowel (commonly distal/ terminal ileum)
**Omentum
**Appendix 
**Fallopian tube
*Management
**Fluid therapy
**Wrapping the bowel with moist saline pads
**Early antibiotic therapy
**Surgical repair
***Vaginal, transabdominal, or combined approach
***Choice depends on bowel viability, the ability to reduce the prolapsed bowel, and the need for and extent of vaginal repair or reconstruction
***The decision to proceed with the definitive repair primarily or to delay until resolution of inflammation depends on the viability of the tissues


*'''Pittsburgh'''  
**'''2007''' (2000-2006) PMID 17478361 -- &quot;Incidence and patient characteristics of vaginal cuff dehiscence after different modes of hysterectomies.&quot; (Hur HC, J Minim Invasive Gynecol. 2007 May-Jun;14(3):311-7.)
***Retrospective. 7286 hysterectomies (7039 total and 247 supracervical) performed by abdominal (TAH), vaginal (TVH), laparoscopic-assisted vaginal (LAVH), or laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH)
***Outcome: vaginal cuff dehiscence after total hysterectomy 0.14% (10/7286). However, incidence 4.9% after total laparoscopic hysterectomy, 0.3% after total vaginal hysterectomy, and 0.1% after total abdominal hysterectomy
***Characteristics: median age 39 years, median time-to-dehiscence 11 weeks. 6/10 had both cuff dehiscence and bowel evisceration. 6/10 reported first post-op intercourse as the trigger event. 50% smoked cigarettes
***Conclusion: TLH may be associated with an increased risk of vaginal cuff dehiscence
**'''1996''' PMID 8784315 -- &quot;Vaginal evisceration: presentation and management in postmenopausal women.&quot; (Kowalski LD, J Am Coll Surg. 1996 Sep;183(3):225-9.)
***Retrospective. 3 cases. Literature review further 57 cases.
***Risk factors: postmenopausal 41/60 (68%), previous vaginal surgery (73%), presence of enterocele (63%). Most managed by primary repair, either immediately or delayed
***Conclusion: Vaginal evisceration seen with obstetrical or post-coital trauma, but in postmenopausal women also history of vaginal surgery and pelvic support disorder. Hypoestrogenism, atrophy, and devascularization from prior surgery seem to play a significant role

*'''Bologna; 2006''' (1995-2001) PMID 16154253 -- &quot;Transvaginal evisceration after hysterectomy: is vaginal cuff closure associated with a reduced risk?&quot; (Iaco PD, Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol. 2006 Mar 1;125(1):134-8. Epub 2005 Sep 8.)
**Retrospective. 3593 patients, treated with hysterectomy (63% abdominal, 33% vaginal, 4% laparoscopic). Closed cuff 40%, open cuff 60%
**Outcome: vaginal evisceration in 0.3% (10/3593); no difference by route of surgery (abdominal 0.26% vs vaginal 0.25% vs laparoscopic 0.79%), no difference by type of vaginal cuff closure (closed 0.4% vs opened 0.2%)
**Trigger event: intercourse 40%, application of vaginal cylinder 20%, spontaneously 40%. Mean time to evisceration 20 months (2-62 months)
**Conclusion: In young patients, sexual intercourse is the main trigger event; in elderly patients, evisceration is a spontaneous event

*'''NHS; 2006''' (UK) PMID 17130054 -- &quot;Vibrator in the peritoneal cavity: a case of post-hysterectomy vaginal vault evisceration.&quot; (Velchuru VR, J Obstet Gynaecol. 2006 Nov;26(8):826-7.)
**Case report of an unusual presentation.

*'''Lille; 2003''' (France) PMID 12798729 -- &quot;Vaginal evisceration after hysterectomy: the repair by a laparoscopic and vaginal approach with a omental flap.&quot; (Narducci F, Gynecol Oncol. 2003 Jun;89(3):549-51.)
**Case report. 2 patients, 2nd patient with endometrial cancer IB, applicator for vaginal brachytherapy inserted through vaginal cuff with resulting small bowel evisceration

*'''1907''' No PMID -- &quot;Rupture of the vaginal wall with protrusion of small intestines in a woman 63 years of age: Replacement, suture, recovery.&quot; (McGregor AN, J Obstet Gynaecol Br Emp 1907;11:252-8.)

First contact! We learn how to say “hello” and how to introduce ourselves. And I think this is also one of the very first podcasts of the SpanishPod team. At least Leo seems to feel a bit uncomfortable in front of the mic. Well, there is always a first time. The keyword is '''llamarse''' – to call oneself.

:''CosaNostra Pizza #3569 is on Vista Road just down from Kings park Mall. Vista Road used to belong to the State of California and now is called Fairlanes, Inc. Rte. CSV-5.  Its main competition used to be a U.S. Highway and is now called Cruiseways, Inc. Rte. Cal-12.  Farther up the Valley, the two competing highways actually cross.  Once there had been bitter disputes, the intersection closed by sporadic sniper fire.  Finally, a big developer bought the entire intersection and turned it into a drive-through mall.  Now the roads feed into a parking system - not  a lot, not a ramp, but a system – and lose their identity. Getting through the intersection involves tracing paths through the parking system, many braided filaments of direction like the Ho Chi Minh trail.  CSV-5 has better throughput, but Cal-12 has better pavement.  That is typical – Fairlanes roads emphasize getting you there, for Type A drivers, and Cruiseways emphasize the enjoyment, for Type B drivers.'' (Stephenson 1992)

==The Ownership of Transportation Networks:  A Rationale==

To explain the patterns of public and private ownership of transportation networks in the United States and elsewhere, one would need to take a longer view of the development of transportation systems.  While such explanations are beyond the scope of the current text, they may be found elsewhere&lt;ref&gt;Garrison, W.L. and Levinson, D.M. (2006), ''The Transportation Experience:  Policy, Planning, and Deployment'', New York, NY:  Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;.  We will focus instead on some of the common economic themes that lead to observed outcomes.

===Market Failure===

Public ownership of transportation networks has been more prevalent in certain locations and at certain times during history.  A common rationale in more modern times given in support of the public ownership of transportation facilities has been that of [[w:market failure|market failure]].  Though the formal concept of market failure is a relatively recent phenomenon, dating to developments in welfare economics during the early 20th century, earlier forms of it were used to justify public ownership of certain transportation facilities in the United States.  In the colonial U.S., a system of post roads was maintained by the federal government (as will be discussed later), as these roads were considered vital to communication.  Most mail and other types of communication moved by road, and hence it was considered critical to government administrative (and perhaps also judicial) functions that such roads be maintained.  A secondary justification was that such roads would facilitate trade and interstate commerce.  This is a type of &lt;i&gt;positive externality&lt;/i&gt; argument.  While it might have been possible for some such roads to be financed and built privately, there was concern that the desired network would not develop quickly enough, with lower-priority roads linking parts of the rural hinterland to established urban centers significantly lagging the completion of other segments, and thus leaving rural areas with poor lines of communication.

Other types of market failure arguments may also apply in the current context.  Some road and rail networks may exhibit economies of scale, leading to more efficient provision by fewer firms with high levels of output.  In an extreme case, strong economies of scale may indicate the presence of a [[w:natural monopoly|natural monopoly]], where it becomes more efficient for a single provider to produce a good.  In addition to monopoly or market power justifications, there are some public good aspects of transportation networks.  The next section discusses the nature of roads as different types of goods, with some local roads having the characteristics of public goods (non-rivalry and non-excludability).  Private firms might undersupply a public good if there is not sufficient motivation (i.e. profit) for them to do so.

===Government Failure===

While the existence of market failures may provide a rationale for public ownership of transportation networks under certain circumstances, there is also a countervailing argument that cautions against public ownership as a response to instances of market failure.  The public sector analogy to market failure is known as [[w:government failure|government failure]], and refers to situations where government intervention causes a more inefficient allocation of resources than would occur in the absence of the intervention.

There are many types of government failure, but the ones most relevant in the context of transportation policy tend to be legislative in nature.  They include issues of [[w:logrolling|logrolling]], [[w:pork barrel spending|pork barrel spending]] and [[w:rent-seeking|rent-seeking]].

&lt;i&gt;Logrolling&lt;/i&gt; is a term applied to political allocation processes to describe the act of vote-trading among members of a political body.  James Buchanan and Gordon Tullock, in their seminal work on political economy entitled [[w:The Calculus of Consent|The Calculus of Consent]]&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, J.M. and Tullock, G. (1962), ''The Calculus of Consent:  Logical Foundations of Constitutional Democracy'', Ann Arbor, MI:  University of Michigan Press.&lt;/ref&gt;, described a formal model of simple majority voting incorporating as an example the maintenance of local roads by a group of rural farmers.  Buchanan and Tullock show how bargaining (vote trading) among the participants allows for agreements that ensure the maintenance of all roads.  However, the cost of this bargaining is shown to be an aggregate overinvestment of resources, since each farmer must pay for the maintenance of all other local roads in order to ensure the maintenance of the road that serves his property.  There is a direct analogy between this process and the process used to allocate resources for transportation by the U.S. Congress.  The rapid growth of federal transportation programs during recent re-authorization cycles, not only in terms of absolute expenditures but also in terms of the number and scope of programs, provides strong evidence of this.

&lt;i&gt;Pork barrel spending&lt;/i&gt; has become one of the more ubiquitous forms of government failure in U.S. transportation policy.  The term refers to the process of elected officials securing spending on projects or programs for the primary benefit of members of their home district&lt;ref&gt;Knight, B. (2004), &quot;Parochial interests and the centralized provision of local public goods:  evidence from congressional voting on transportation projects&quot;, ''Journal of Public Economics'', 88:  845-866.&lt;/ref&gt;.  This practice has become synonymous with the process of [[w:Earmark (politics)|earmarking]], in which provisions are included in bills or committee reports to direct spending to specific projects, often without any form of evaluation to determine the project's social desirability.  The most recent federal transportation bill, authorized in 2005, included more than 6,000 earmarks, totalling more than $24 billion in spending.  The project which came to represent the most egregious example of pork barrel spending in transportation was the proposed $398 million [[w:Gravina Island Bridge|Gravina Island Bridge]] in Alaska, infamously known as the &quot;Bridge to Nowhere&quot;.  Other prominent examples of pork barrel spending include Boston's [[w:Big Dig|Big Dig]], the [[w:John Murtha Johnstown-Cambria County Airport|Johnstown Airport]] and [[w:Interstate 99|Interstate 99]] in Pennsylvania, and the [[w:Don Young#Coconut Road|Coconut Road Interchange]] in Florida.  Pork barrel spending has also influenced the design of federal highway and public transit programs, both of which are structured to spread benefits as widely as possible across congressional districts in order to ensure local support.

&lt;i&gt;Rent-seeking&lt;/i&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Tullock | first=Gordon | year=1967 | month=June | title=The welfare costs of tariffs, monopolies, and theft | journal=Western Economic Journal | volume=5 | issue=3 | pages=224-232 | url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119722738/abstract | issn=00433640 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; involves the manipulation of the economic environment by private individuals or groups in order to extract economic rents.  Governments are a primary target of rent-seekers, since they may offer special priviliges in the form of budget allocations or regulatory treatment, and are susceptible to interest group lobbying.  A classic example in the field transportation is the [[w:Davis-Bacon Act|Davis-Bacon Act]], which applies to all federally-funded public works projects in the United States.  The Act requires the payment of &quot;locally prevailing&quot; wages to workers employed on such projects.  The term &quot;prevailing&quot; is generally understood to refer to local unionized wage rates, including fringe benefits.  Originally passed in 1931, the law has survived numerous attempts to repeal it or weaken its provisions, owing largely to political support from unionized construction labor.  The Davis-Bacon Act, among other provisions (such as the [[w:Surface Transportation Assistance Act#Section 165: &quot;Buy America&quot; Act|Buy America Act]]), is cited as a source of rising construction costs on many federally-funded projects&lt;ref&gt;Winston, C. (2000), &quot;Government Failure in Urban Transportation&quot;, ''Fiscal Studies'', 21(4):  403-425.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In practice, both market failure and government failure have influenced the nature of ownership arrangements in the provision of transportation.  In addition to these considerations, the type of good represented by different transportation assets may influence not only the distinction of public versus private ownership, but also which level of government should be responsible for providing transportation infrastructure and services in the case of public ownership.  As we will also see, there are a range of possible outcomes in terms of the degree of private involvement in the provision of transportation.

==The Nature of Transportation as a Good and Its Ownership==

=== Elements of Vehicle/Highway System ===
The existing vehicle/highway system can be characterized as having a sort of quasi-private form of ownership.  While in many elements are publicly owned:
* Road infrastructure 
* Traffic control
* Public transit services

The system does have several elements that are privately supplied including:

* Private vehicles	
* Time
* Roadside Services (Gas, Food, Lodging)
* Origins
* Destinations
* Parking

===Functional Highway Classification by Type of Good===

There are four types of [[w:Common good (economics)|goods]] that are determined by their technical characteristics concerning excludability and rivalry:

{| {{table}}
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|''''''
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|''''''
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|'''Excludability'''

|-
| ||&lt;i&gt;No&lt;/i&gt;||Club||Public
|-
| ||||||
|}

&lt;i&gt;Public goods&lt;/i&gt; are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, 

&lt;i&gt;Private goods&lt;/i&gt; are both excludable and rivalrous.  

&lt;i&gt;Club goods&lt;/i&gt; (for instance a country club membership) are excludable, but non-rivalrous (in the absence of crowding).  

&lt;i&gt;Congesting goods&lt;/i&gt; are rivalrous but not excludable, for instance a crowded street. While an individual cannot be excluded from a city street, that person’s presence may cost you extra time and his occupation of space does prevent you from occupying the same space at a given time. (Note that limited access highways are potentially excludable, unlike city streets.)

==== Excludability ====
Excludability implies that the good’s provider can prevent a user from obtaining it without charge

National defense for instance is non-excludable, America’s nuclear weapons protect anyone in the country, whether or not they want it.  On the other hand the sale of anything in a store is excludable – the owner can prevent a customer from obtaining a good unless the customer pays (assuming enforceable property rights etc.).

==== Rivalry ====
Rivalry implies that one person’s consumption of a particular good prevents another individual from consuming it. 

National defense again is non-rivalrous – one person’s protection does not prevent another’s protection.  Shoes are rivalrous, only one person can wear a pair at a time.

==== Roads ====
[[File:HierarchyOfRoads.png|thumb|right|250px|Hierarchy of roads delineates which roads serve property access and which roads serve movement]]
Roads exist largely to serve two purposes:  movement and access (specifically, access to property).  Different types of roads have characteristics of different types of goods based on their functional classification&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, D.M. (2005), &quot;Paying for the Fixed Costs of Roads&quot;, ''Journal of Transport Economics and Policy'', 39(3):  279-294.&lt;/ref&gt;.  In other words, there is a correspondence between the [[w:Hierarchy of roads|functional classification of a road]] and the type of good it represents.  What types of roads are which type of goods?

Limited access highways (freeways) and some arterials with signalized intersections and few access points, could be considered &lt;i&gt;private goods&lt;/i&gt;, since it is possible to identify and exclude users with appropriate toll technologies.  These roads are also rivalrous since, in the absence of pricing or other measures to limit demand, an additional user can affect the use of the road by others.

Local roads lie on the other end of the spectrum in terms of functional classification, since they exist primarily to provide property access.  Local streets can be excludable if access to them is restricted.  Access restrictions may take many forms, ranging from the simple posting of signs indicating that access is restricted to residents to actual physical restrictions, such as gates.  The latter type of restriction is typically associated with gated communities or other forms of private residential development.  Local streets are also generally non-rivalrous in that their low levels of traffic tend to preclude problems with congestion.  This combination of characteristics (excludability and non-rivalry) indicates that some local streets may be considered &lt;i&gt;club goods&lt;/i&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, J.M. (1965), &quot;An Economic Theory of Clubs&quot;, ''Economica'', 32(125):  1-14.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The oldest such example in the United States is that of Benton Place in St. Louis, Missouri, where adjoining property owners were required to join a private association which was responsible for road maintenance, with assessments being levied on each association member &lt;ref&gt;Beito, B.T. and Smith, B. (1990), &quot;The Formation of Urban Infrastructure Through Non-Governmental Planning:  The Private Places of St. Louis&quot;, ''Journal of Urban History'', 16:  263-303.&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Local streets are typically provided by local governments with no restrictions on access.  In the absence of access restrictions local streets may be both non-rivalrous and non-excludable, leading them to take on more of the character of a &lt;i&gt;public good&lt;/i&gt;.  Note the term &quot;public good&quot; in this case is defined by the economic characteristics of the good, and not simply by the fact that it is supplied by the public sector.

Between limited-access highways and local streets are a middle level of road, collectors, that link local streets with limited-access highways.  These “linking collectors” serve both access and mobility functions, since they may also provide access to some adjacent properties.  These roads may be considered “congesting” or [[w:common good (economics)|common]] goods.

The characterization of roads in terms of functional classification may also inform decisions about which level of government should be responsible for providing a given road (assuming the decision is made to provide the road publicly).  Local units of government seem best suited to providing local streets, since they are closest to the problem.  Roads that provide for a higher level of movement, such as limited-access highways, ought to be provided by higher-level jurisdictions, such as states.  Of course, there are tradeoffs involved in each of these decisions.  Smaller jurisdictions may not be able to fully realize [[w:economy of scale|scale economies]], while larger jurisdictions may encounter problems with [[w:span of control|span of control]].  Between these extremes there is some optimal mix of expenditures between different levels of government that minimizes capital and operating costs&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, D.M. and Yerra, B. (2002), “Highway Costs and the Efficient Mix of State and Local Funds”, ''Transportation Research Record:  Journal of the Transportation Research Board'' 1812:  27-36.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Realms of Public and Private Involvement ==
[[Image:TE-Ownership.png|thumb|600px|right|Spectrum of transportation infrastructure ownership]]

One can think of the degree of public and private involvement in the provision of transportation as falling somewhere along a continuum between fully public and fully private ownership.  Returning to the example of road provision, the figure outlines the various forms of possible public and private ownership structures, along with the types of functional class roads they might apply to.

Under conventional forms of government ownership and provision, responsibility for road provision is divided between federal, state, and local government.  Federal and state governments have primary responsibility for arterial roads (including the Interstate system in the U.S.), with states also operating some more heavily-used collector roads.  Local governments provide some combination of collector and local roads.  In addition, some local roads may be provided by non-governmental organizations, such as homeowners' associations and individual private landowners (as in the case of apartment complexes).

One could also conceive of roads being provided under a public utility framework, where responsibility for maintenance and operation of the roads was transferred to a quasi-public authority.  This might be an acceptable way to provide the network of linking collectors that connect local roads with higher-level arterials (limited-access highways) and serve both access and mobility functions.

Alternately, the private sector can be involved in the provision of roads to varying degrees.  Most public works and transportation departments involve the private sector to at least a minimal degree in such activities as planning, design, construction and maintenance.  

The more limited forms of private involvement in road provision tend to involve the &lt;i&gt;outsourcing&lt;/i&gt; of road design, construction and maintenance activities to private consulting and construction firms.  Private contractors may enter into &lt;i&gt;service contracts&lt;/i&gt; with government agencies to provide certain specified operations and maintenance activities.  These contracts may apply to all classes of publicly-owned roads.  Outsourcing may also apply to more comprehensive &lt;i&gt;management contracts&lt;/i&gt;, in which the contractor may be responsible for the design and construction of a road (often under so-called [[w:design-build|design-build]] project delivery systems), sometimes coupled with provisions for operations and major maintenance activities.  These types of contracts often are applied to the construction of new arterial roads in cases where a public authority is unwilling to give up full control of a project.

Greater private sector involvement in terms of project financing and risk assumption are possible through agreements between public authorities and private contractors for the &lt;i&gt;franchising&lt;/i&gt; of road projects &lt;ref&gt;Fielding, G.J. and Klein, D.B (1993), &quot;How to Franchise Highways&quot;, ''Journal of Transport Economics and Policy'', 27(2):  113-130.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Franchise agreements often leave the ownership of the road in the hands of the public sector, while leasing it out to private operators who agree to operate and maintain the road for over a given period specified in the contract.  This method is often adopted for projects involving the construction of new arterial roads, where the contractor is responsible for some combination of design, construction, finance, operation and maintenance activities.  Many contracts are structured such that the management and operation of the road asset will revert back to the public authority after the expiration of the contract.  Franchise arrangements for highways also typically involve contracts that contain rather detailed provisions regarding pricing, operations, and maintenance requirements. 

The greatest amount of private participation in road provision is made possible via the [[w:divestment|divestiture]] of existing roads by the public sector.  Divestiture involves the outright sale of an existing road to a private firm, who is then free to operate the road and collect charges from users to financing its operation.  Examples of full divestiture of roads are rare in the United States though, as will be discussed later, there has been some renewed interest in the franchising of existing highways in recent years.

=== Public Role in Private Provision of Infrastructure ===
The public sector has generally had three different types of roles that interact with private sector in the provision of transportation infrastructure.

* The public sector may be the ''recipient'' of privately provided infrastructure. Traditionally the public sector owns, operates, and maintains street and road infrastructure. However developers may build local roads and streets and dedicate them to the public sector as part of their role in making land suitable for occupancy. These private in-kind contributions are the most common type of private provision of infrastructure.

* The public sector may play a role as ''facilitator'' in the provision of infrastructure.  Government agencies may provide planning and coordination activities in anticipation of the development of an infrastructure project, possibly including the assembly of land for right-of-way (which in some cases may require the use of [[w:Eminent domain|eminent domain]] powers).  Some public entities will also offer financial inducements to facilitate the provision of infrastructure.  In addition to some of the tax advantages offered to private investors in the financing of infrastructure projects (which will be discussed in the next section), public entities may sometimes provide matching grants to encourage private investment.  A more traditional role of the public sector in facilitating private investment has been for the state to act as a [[w:Broker|broker]] for infrastructure projects, combining its traditional coordination activities with the discretion to select a private developer for an infrastructure project from among multiple competing proposals.

* The third type of role that the public sector might play is to serve as an ''investor'' in infrastructure projects.  Governments may serve as stockholders in some private projects, though this practice has been limited in the US (see the preceding section on the history of state involvement in US road provision for the early precedents to this policy).  In some cases, the public sector may form a transportation corridor development corporation to guide the development of an infrastructure project.  Lastly, the public sector may play a more traditional role as developer in an infrastructure project.

=== Private Role in Public Sector ===
There are also many situations in which the private sector plays a role in the public sector's provision of transportation.  Consider the case of highways.  The private sector is often intimately involved in several aspects of the development of highways.  Private consultants are often hired to provide expertise in the planning and design functions on specific roadway projects.  Private construction contractors are hired to manage the actual construction of transportation projects once the design work has been completed.  Sometimes these functions are more closely integrated into what are termed [[w:Design-build|&quot;design-build&quot;]] contracts.

The private sector may also be invited to participate in the operation of public facilities.  In some cases, existing assets such as toll roads will be put out to bid for the right to operate them for a limited period of time.  Recent examples of this include the [[w:Indiana Toll Road|Indiana Toll Road]] and the [[w:Chicago Skyway|Chicago Skyway]].  Sometimes a public entity will sell an asset to a private investor, then lease it from the investor and continue to operate it, an arrangement referred to as a [[w:Leaseback|leaseback]] scheme.  Under such a scheme, the public entity benefits by being able to raise cash through the sale of the asset, while the investor is able to claim the tax benefits from the [[w:Depreciation|depreciation]] of the asset.  

The private sector may also be encouraged to take on a greater role in the provision of new infrastructure.  Beyond the traditional planning, design and construction functions, public entities may award contracts that require private firms to take on responsibility for the financing and ongoing operation of a road.  These contracts are referred to as [[w:Project delivery method|Design-Build-Operate-Maintain (DBOM)]] or [[w:Project delivery method|Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT)]] contracts, with the latter containing provisions for the transfer of the asset back to public ownership after a given [[w:Concession|concessionary]] period.

== Differences in Transportation Ownership by Country ==

There is a great deal of diversity reflected in the international experience with the ownership and development of transportation networks.  Here we will provide a brief survey of the experiences in a few of the more developed, industrialized countries of the world.
=== United States ===

Article 1, Section 8 of the United States Constitution states that:

''The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States; but all duties, imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States; … To establish post offices and post roads; …''

Amendment IX adds:

''The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.'' 

Also, Amendment X provides that:

''The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.''

It is not entirely clear what the above provisions prescribe in terms of ownership and operation of transportation infrastructure.  On one hand, Article 1, Section 8 provides for the establishment of [[w:post roads|post roads]], which initially were meant to imply major routes connecting cities, essentially the equivalent of modern highways.  However, as the population grew and mail service became more widespread the designation of post roads became less clear.  Also, a law passed in 1838 extended the designation to all railroads.  The addition of Amendment X indicates that transportation activities not under the purview of the federal government (for example, those identified in Article 1), should be left the states or to private individuals.  States, in turn, could devolve some powers to local units of government.

Early federal road bills were vetoed by Presidents James Madison, James Monroe and Andrew Jackson, primarily on the grounds that they overstepped the bounds of federal authority granted by the Constitution. 

One might interpret the above provisions as prescribing a rather limited federal role for transportation, especially considering the declining importance of having a set of federally-designated post roads and the development of rather robust roadway networks.  In contrast, the federal role in transportation has grown considerably, particularly during the latter half of the 20th century.  While states have taken on increasing roles in constructing and maintaining transportation networks, the federal government still has a large presence in terms of regulatory policy and financing.  These two activities are the primary instruments through which the United States implements its transportation policies.

Currently, governments provide the majority of the system of roads and highways in the U.S.  In turn, they recover part of the cost through the imposition of fuel taxes, vehicle license fees, sales taxes on motor vehicles, weight-distance charge from trucks, and various other fees and penalties (fines).  The federal portion of the [[w:Fuel taxes in the United States|motor fuels tax]], currently at 18.4 cents per gallon, is directed to the federal Highway Trust Fund.  Most of the federal Trust Fund revenues are distributed to the states as aid for highway and bridge construction.  The remaining share is distributed for mass transit grants to cities and for environmental remediation projects related to leaky underground fuel storage tanks.  States add their own motor fuel taxes, which raises the US national average motor fuel tax to 47 cents per gallon.  Some state and local governments also operate toll facilities, mostly roads and bridges, which account for a little over 5 percent of all transportation-related revenues.  Most of the toll facilities in the U.S. are located in older, northeastern states and many of them predate the initiation of the [[w:Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highway System]].  More recently, faster-growing Sunbelt states like California, Florida and Texas have accounted for most of the growth in the mileage of toll roads in the U.S.

The Interstate Highway System (also known as the ''Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways'') is a unique feature of the U.S. transportation system.  It is comprised of a national network of over 46,000 miles of grade-separate, limited-access highways.  The network was initially planned during the 1940s, while the U.S. was involved in World War II, and was presented to the public primarily as a critical component of national defense.  The stated goal was to provide the ability to move large amounts of troops and equipment across the country quickly.  A second important goal was to facilitate interstate commerce, coinciding with the growth of commercial truck traffic, though this goal was not as prominently promoted.  Construction on the Interstate system began in 1956, under the Eisenhower administration.  Today, states retain much of the responsibility for maintaining the Interstate system, with the federal government providing grants funded the federal fuel tax.  The Interstate system remains publicly owned, largely on the grounds that national defense is too important to place in private hands.



Most airports in the United States are owned and operated by municipal governments or local authorities.  This remains the case despite a recent attempt to privatize Chicago's [[w:Chicago Midway International Airport|Midway Airport]].  The privatization proposal, initiated in 2008, would have taken the form of a long-term (99-year) lease from the City of Chicago in exchange for a $2.5 billion up-front payment.  The lease arrangement fell through when the consortium that would have operated the airport was unable to put together a full financing package.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) imposes taxes on aviation fuels, passenger tickets and several other aviation-related items in order to fund the [[w:Airport and Airway Trust Fund|Airport and Airway Trust Fund]] (AATF).  The Trust Fund, authorized in 1970 under the [[w:Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970|Airport and Airway Development Act]], finances air traffic control and grants to local authorities for airport improvements.  These funds are supplemented by revenues raised by local airport authorities from sources such as landing fees (based on the maximum landing weight of aircraft), passenger facility charges (PFCs), parking charges, and concessions for retail activities at major airports.  Each airport has its own user charge schedules.  Airport expansion costs are usually raised by airport bonds secured by signatory (major) carriers.  This gives the signatory airlines power to veto any major changes to landing fee structures or airport slot allocation systems.  This veto power has proven to carry weight, for example, when [[w:LaGuardia Airport|LaGuardia Airport's]] incumbent airlines blocked a recent proposal to auction off airport slots during peak traffic periods.

Airport congestion has become a recurrent problem in many locations throughout the U.S., often affecting the on-time performance of carriers.  Only a handful of airports, such as those in the New York City area and Boston's Logan Airport, use landing fees during peak periods in order to mitigate congestion.  The fees are typically designed to get smaller aircraft to move their flights to off-peak periods or to other nearby, less congested airports.  Airport gate and [[w:Landing slot|Landing slots]] are a similar type of mechanism for allocating peak capacity.  Some landing slots are transferable among carriers.  However, the method used by most airports to allocate slots to carriers tends to confer windfall gains on existing carriers.

Expanding capacity at U.S. airports has proven difficult in recent years due to political and environmental considerations.  When physical expansion is undertaken, it is often in the form of adding a runway to an existing airport rather than building an entirely new one.  In the U.S., [[w:Denver International Airport|Denver International Airport]] has been the only new airport built since 1974.

The development of Canadian policies toward transportation have some importance differences from those in the United States.  Like the U.S., Canada has maintained some degree of shared responsibility for transportation between the national government and the country's 10 provinces.  However, unlike the U.S., Canada has devolved responsibility to lower levels of government to a much greater degree.  With the exception of air transportation and marine navigation, most transportation functions are devolved to provincial and lower levels of government&lt;ref&gt;Heaver, T.D. and Waters, W.G. II (2005), &quot;Transportation Policy in Canada&quot; in K.J. Button and D.A. Hensher, eds. ''Handbook of Transport Strategy, Policy and Institutions'', Amsterdam:  Elsevier Science Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Canada has also undertaken more extensive measures to privatize certain types of infrastructure and services, particularly in air transportation (e.g. airports and air traffic control).

Canadian transportation policy, especially toward issues of ownership of transportation infrastructure, has gone through significant change since the mid-1980s, when a wave of [[w:Economic liberalization|economic liberalization]] affected many sectors of the Canadian economy, including transportation.  The roots of regulatory reform in Canada's transportation sector can be traced back to the MacPherson Royal Commission on Transportation (1961-62), which was tasked with studying the issues of the railway industry, which came under financial stress during the 1950s when it started losing commercial traffic to competing modes such as intercity trucking and waterways.  The Commission recommended broader regulatory liberalization across the transportation sector with a more limited role for government subsidy in guiding transportation policy.  Many of the Commission's recommendations toward Canada's railways were adopted with the 1967 National Transportation Act, though the recommendations regarding regulatory liberalization of other modes were not.  Liberalization policies toward other modes were picked up again during the 1980s under a more conservative national government.

Railway companies themselves provide their own infrastructure; roadbeds, tracks, yards and stations;
Ports Canada, a crown corporation, owns and operates major ports in Canada;  each port authority (e.g., Port of Vancouver) enjoys substantial autonomy.

While a department of the Canadian government, [[w:Transport Canada|Transport Canada]], has broad responsibility setting regulations and policies affecting transportation in Canada, decisions about road construction are placed under the jurisdiction of individual Canadian provinces.  The [[w:Trans-Canada Highway|Trans-Canada Highway]], a transcontinental highway link, was built through a federal-provincial partnership that emphasized connecting and upgrading major inter-regional links within provinces.  Apart from this effort, there is little federal involvement in the provision of roads.  Roads costs are partially recovered through a combination of fuel taxes, vehicle license fees, and other fees and penalties.  [[w:Fuel taxes in Canada|Fuel taxes]] in Canada include a combination of federal and provincial excise and sales taxes, a portion of which are directed to a Gas Tax Fund which is used to finance municipal infrastructure.  

Canadian provinces make limited use of [[w:List of toll roads#Canada|toll facilities]] in the road sector.  The primary use of tolls on Canadian roads is to provide a revenue stream to repay bonds issued for road construction.  Some highways that were initially tolled have since seen the tolls decommissioned.  Most recently, the [[w:British Columbia Highway 5|Coquihalla Highway]] had its toll facility decommissioned in 2008.  Originally completed in 1987 at a cost of $848 million, the highway's tolls were removed after the BC government had collected a roughly equal amount of revenue during the toll road's 20 years of operation.  

Private participation in the development of road infrastructure has been limited to a couple of major facilities.  [[w:Highway 407 (Ontario)|Ontario Provincial Highway 407]] was built between the late 1980s and late 1990s under a 35-year lease to a private consortium.  Under the original agreement, the highway was to be transferred back to the provincial government at the end of the lease.  However, in 1999 the Ontario government passed a budget-balancing resolution that included a 99-year lease of the highway to a private consortium.  The 407 facility is one of few in the world to use an all-electronic toll collection system.  The other major privately-developed road infrastructure project in Canada is the [[w:Confederation Bridge|Confederation Bridge]], an 8-mile toll bridge connecting the mainland province of New Brunswick with the island province of Prince Edward Island, off Canada's eastern coast.  The Confederation Bridge was completed in 1997 under a [[w:Build-Operate-Transfer|build-operate-transfer]] agreement between the Canadian government and a private developer, Strait Crossing Development Incorporated.  A subsidiary of the developer, Strait Crossing Bridge Limited (SCBL) will operate the bridge for 35 years and collect tolls, with the operation of the bridge reverting back to the Canadian government at the end of the lease.  SCBL services the debt issued to pay for the bridge's construction with a combination of toll revenue and subsidy payments from the Canadian government for the ferry services it continues to operate at a loss in order to provide transportation for pedestrians, cyclists and other types of vehicles that are prohibited from using the bridge.  It is important to note that the original motivation for building the bridge was to provide a [[w:fixed link|fixed link]] across the Northumberland Strait to better connect Prince Edward Island with mainland Canada, and to partially replace the ferry service that previously carried most traffic to the island.

Transport Canada also retains a large role in Canada's aviation system.  Prior to 1996, it had responsibility for both aviation regulation and provision of air traffic services.  While it retains most of its regulatory functions, Transport Canada's responsibility for provision air traffic service has been greatly reduced.  The adoption of the [[w:National Airports Policy (Canada)|National Airports Policy]] in the early 1990s led to the divestiture of many smaller airports, while Transport Canada retained ownership over the larger airports in the [[w:National Airports System|National Airports System]].  The larger airports are leased to local private operating authorities.  The National Airports Policy resulted in privatization of other aspects of the aviation system as well.  A new private, non-profit company ([[w:Nav Canada|Nav Canada]]) owns and operates Canada's air traffic control and air navigation systems.

=== Japan ===

Japan's major intercity roads are owned and operated by regionally-based public corporations.

Regionally based public corporations own and operate major intercity roads;
* other roads financed by fuel taxes
* many toll roads make profit after paying back the capital costs of construction and expansion.

Local authorities own major airports such as Narita and Kansai International airports;
* Landing fees and passenger fees are high;
* Government subsidize contruction and expansion costs


=== Europe ===

European Commission has proposed to establish a rail infrastructure company to own and maintain railroad tracks and stations, and let rail carriers use it for fees to provide competing services.

== Privatization ==
Gomez-Ibanez and Meyer&lt;ref name=Gomez-Ibanez1993&gt;{{cite book | last1=Gomez-Ibanez | first1=Jose A. | last2=Meyer | first2=John R. | year=1993 | title=Going Private:  The International Experience with Transport Privatization | publisher=Brookings Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt; have identified three types of privatization that may apply to transportation systems.  Privatization may take the form of the sale of existing state-owned businesses, private infrastructure development, or the outsourcing of conventional public sector functions by contracting with private vendors.

=== Sale of existing state owned business ===
The first type of privatization is the sale of former state-owned business (public enterprises).  During the 1980s, many governments in Europe and the developing world (South America in particular) initiated the sale of state-owned enterprises.  Western European countries, led by France and the United Kingdom, were eager to return to the private sector many industries that were nationalized following World War II.  These industries included public utilities, transportation, and some heavy industry (e.g. British Steel in the UK).  Similar developments were taking place in the developing world, led by South American countries such as Chile and Argentina.  The rationale was largely the same:  a belief that the private sector could operate such enterprises more efficiently.  Around the same time, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of the former Communist Bloc left many Eastern European countries to make the transition toward a market economy.  This transition affected the transportation sector in a large number of countries, where governments were eager to promote private sector participation in functions such as the provision of urban and intercity bus services.  Reviews of early experiences with such reforms have started to appear for countries such as Poland&lt;ref&gt;Pucher, J. (1995), &quot;The Road to Ruin?  Impacts of Economic Shock Therapy on Urban Transport in Poland&quot;, ''Transport Policy'', 2(1):  5-13.&lt;/ref&gt; and Hungary&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, J.D. and Saleh, W. and Prileszky, I. (1997), &quot;Ownership and Control of the Bus Industry:  The Case of Hungary&quot;, ''Journal of Transport Geography'', 5(2):  137-146.&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Private Infrastructure Development ===

The second type of privatization involves private participation in infrastructure development.  While there has been more experience outside of the United States with private transportation infrastructure development in recent years, there are some limited examples domestically.  These include the privately-developed [[w:91 Express Lanes|SR 91 Express Lanes]] in California, the [[w:Virginia State Route 267#Dulles Greenway|Dulles Greenway]] in the Northern Virginia suburbs of the Washington, D.C. region, and the [[w:Las Vegas Monorail|Las Vegas Monorail]], one of the few examples of privately financed passenger rail systems in the U.S.  In most cases where the private sector is invited to participate in transportation infrastructure development, the primary motive is raising new money for transportation, something that can be more difficult to accomplish under a system that is reliant on tax financing.

=== Outsourcing of conventional public sector functions by contracting with private vendors ===
The third type of privatization is the outsourcing of conventional public sector functions by contracting with private vendors.  This type of privatization has gained wider acceptance in the U.S. and has become fairly standard practice for many transportation and public works departments.  Functions such as road maintenance and highway management are routinely contracted to private firms.  

Many urban public transit agencies in the U.S. also contract with private vendors to provide maintenance services, direct operation of some transit routes, or both.  For example, a number of cities in the northeastern U.S. have contracted with Amtrak or one of several private firms to operate commuter rail services.  The selection of Amtrak as the operator in some cases was due to the fact that Amtrak owns the rail infrastructure on some lines where it also provides intercity passenger service.

In both cases, the primary motive for outsourcing maintenance, management or operations is financial gain on the part of government.  Many governments have been able to realize cost savings in the provision and maintenance of transportation infrastructure through competitive contracting of services&lt;ref&gt;Poole, R.W., Jr. and Fixler, P.E., Jr. (1987), &quot;Privatization of Public-Sector Services in Practice:  Experience and Potential&quot;, ''Journal of Policy Analysis and Management'', 6(4):  612-625.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The savings may then be used to either expand or improve the quality of service, to pay down existing debt levels, or to lower the burden of taxation that is borne by citizens.

=== Disadvantages of Privatization ===
Privatization of transportation infrastructure and services may also have some disadvantages.  These can be categorized in terms of whether they apply to private firms or to society more broadly.

====Disadvantages to private firms====
* Private firms must pay taxes
* Private firms must borrow funds at market interest rates
* Private firms do not have eminent domain powers

====Disadvantage to society====
* Type 1 privatization (sale of state-owned businesses) may upset existing property/equity relationships.  Winners and losers are created.  
* Cost savings may lead to unemployment when firms cut back on unprofitable services.  These workers must find employment elsewhere in the economy, something that may not easy to do during periods of recession.
* Environmental sensitivity may not be in a private firm's objective function.

=== Lessons for Success ===

Privatization is easier when:
* There is competition in input and output markets
* Possible efficiency gains are large
* Few redistributions or transfers are required
* There are few controversies with the environment or opposition to economic growth
* An activity or service covers its cost BUT profits are not TOO high

== Transit Bus Privatization ==
One industry within the transportation sector where privatization has gained momentum in recent decades has been bus transit, particularly urban (intracity) bus services.  The relatively low fixed costs associated with provision of bus services provides the potential for a market with relatively low barriers to entry and intense competition.

=== Regulation Cycle ===
Like many modes of transportation, urban bus transit has gone through many stages of growth, maturity, decline and some degree of rationalization.  Gomez-Ibanez and Meyer&lt;ref name=Gomez-Ibanez1993/&gt; have identified a 10-stage cycle of regulation and privatization that broadly reflects the experience with bus transit in many countries around the world.  The 10 stages are listed below.  

# Entrepreneurial
# Consolidation
# Regulation of Fares and Franchises
# Decline in Profits
# Withdrawal of capital and services
# Public takeover
# Public subsidies
# Declining efficiency
# Vicious cycle of subsidy cuts, fare increases, service cuts, declining riders
# Privatization [Go to 1 or 3]

While most cities begin at the first stage (entrepreneurial) of the cycle, some remain in the stages of public ownership and subsidy (stages 6 and 7), while others have moved on to various degrees of privatization (stage 10).  Where privatization has taken place, the cycle indicates that cities typically revert to either an entrepreneurial phase or to a phase in which services are privately provided, but certain aspects of provision such as fares and franchises are regulated.

=== Types of Privatization ===
Depending on which policy objectives are being pursued, bus transit privatization may either &lt;i&gt;eliminate&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;supplement&lt;/i&gt; public ownership.  Where governments are looking to divest themselves of the ownership and operation of buses services and to end or limit the provision of subsidies, they may allow greater entry for private providers and limit regulatory involvement.  Partial forms of privatization can also allow governments to continue to pursue certain social objectives (for example, providing service to low-income users), while maintaining ownership of bus service.  An example of this is the competitive tendering of bus services, which is a more common form of partial privatization in the U.S., where the public sector retains ownership of bus services but enters into a contract with a private provider to operate the service.  Decisions on fares, scheduling and service levels typically remain in the hands of the public organization. 

Conditions on Privatization

Fares

*  Deregulation of fares (Colombo Sri Lanka, Santiago Chile) [Colombo kept the public company with low fares and overcrowding; Santiago had a proliferation of modes, drivers formed route associations and raised fares, service is better but still crowding]
* Regulation of fares (everywhere else)

Routes

* Deregulation of routes ... direct subsidies to specific routes
* Regulation of routes ... must provide service on unprofitable routes -&gt; cross subsidy

=== Britain's Buses ===
The most high-profile experiment with transit bus privatization in recent history has been the privatization and deregulation of [[w:Bus transport in the United Kingdom|local bus services]] in the UK.  Privatization began with the passage of the [[w:Transport Act 1985|Transport Act of 1985]] which privatized and deregulated bus services throughout the UK, though London did not fully deregulate its services, opting instead for a system of franchised routes.  The Transport Act was passed under the conservative [[w:Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] regime, as part of a series of sweeping economic reforms which privatized several former state-owned enterprises.  

The Act requires only that firms register the commencement of, or changes to, a bus service at least 42 days in advance.  Under the law, bus operators are only allowed to offer scheduled services, prohibiting [[w:Share taxi|jitney-type]] services.  Local governments may refuse to allow a service only in the event of serious safety or traffic congestion problems.  They may also supplement privately registered routes by offering unserved routes for competitive tender&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Klein | first1=Daniel B. | last2=Moore | first2=Adrian T. | last3=Reja | first3=Binyam | year=1997 | title=Curb rights:  eliciting competition and entrepreneurship in urban transit | journal=The Independent Review | volume=11 | issue=1 | pages=29-54 | url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=473441 | doi=10.2139/ssrn.473441 | accessdate=2010-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

New entrants - low cost by lower wages, lower overhead, flexible work rules, do not usually lower prices, passengers are unlikely to wait.  

The privatization and deregulation of bus services in Britain was designed to inject competition into the supply of bus services and thus to exert downward pressure on costs.  This goal was largely achieved, as new entrants with with lower costs entered many markets and exerted pressure on incumbent operators.  The newer firms tended to achieve lower costs through lower wages, more flexible work rules, and lower overhead costs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gomez-Ibanez | first1=Jose A. | last2=Meyer | first2=John R. | year=1990 | title=Privatizing and deregulating local public services:  lessons from Britain's buses | journal=Journal of the American Planning Association | volume=56 | issue=1 | pages=9-21 | url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a787367194&amp;db=all | doi=10.1080/01944369008975740 | accessdate=2010-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Existing firms were forced to respond by cutting their own costs.  Since these firms retained many employees from their pre-deregulation days while simultaneously hiring new workers, a two-tiered wage structure began to emerge reflecting the compensation of these different groups.  Another source of cost savings was the substitution of smaller vehicles (minibuses), operating more frequently and at higher speeds, for larger buses.  Heseltine and Silcock&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Heseltine | first1=P.M. | last2=Silcock | first2=D.T. | year=1990 | month=September | title=The effects of bus deregulation on costs | journal=Journal of Transport Economics and Policy | volume=24 | issue=3 | pages=239-254 | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20052926 | accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; report that just a few years after the initiation of deregulation, former National Bus Company operators claimed to have reduced costs per bus mile by 15 to 20 percent, while former Passenger Transport Executive operators reduced costs by an average of 30 percent.

While significant cost savings were achieved by the deregulated operators, passenger fares increased as broad-based government subsidies were withdrawn.  Examining the experience with the first 10 years of deregulation, Mackie et al.&lt;ref name=Mackie1995&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Mackie | first1=Peter | last2=Preston | first2=John | last3=Nash | first3=Christopher | year=1995 | month=July | title=Bus deregulation:  ten years on | journal=Transport Reviews | volume=15 | issue=3 | pages=229-251 | url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a773221410&amp;db=all | doi=10.1080/01441649508716914 | accessdate=2010-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that throughout the UK, passenger fares increased by an average of about 19 percent, while real subsidies declined by an average of 38 percent.  Demand, measured in terms of passenger journeys, declined by an average of 22 percent nationwide, thought the decline was much lower in the London metropolitan region.  Higher fares were an important factor in explaining the decline, as was the instability in the newly deregulated bus markets.  However, the decline could not be accounted for by diminished service levels, as bus-kilometers of service rose in every region examined&lt;ref name=Mackie1995/&gt;.

One of the more interesting developments in the evolution of the deregulated bus industry was the competitive strategy that was employed by the newly-private firms.  There were initially many small operators in most of the larger markets, though the industry became much more concentrated within a few years, either through the exit of unprofitable firms or through acquisition of smaller operators by larger competitors.  There are essentially no economies of scale in providing local bus services, but large firms have been able to successfully drive out competition by engaging in price wars and using profitable routes to subsidize fares on more competitive routes (cross-subsidization).  Maintenance of competitive conditions on routes is made even more difficult by the scheduling practices employed by the deregulated operators.  Since operators may set any schedule they like, subject to the provision of publishing the change six weeks in advance, many competing operators have an incentive to engage in &quot;route jockeying&quot; or &quot;headrunning&quot;, wherein an operator schedules its service to run immediately ahead of its competitors (and thus take its competitors' customers).  This practice works since passengers are often indifferent to which bus they choose to reach a specific destination, provided prices and quality are roughly equal, and is made easier by the fact that operators must publish their schedules.  Such a strategy often invites retaliatory behavior by incumbent operators, who have been observed to respond by running service so frequently as to prevent competitors from attracting sufficient patronage to survive, a practice known as &quot;route swamping&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dodgson | first1=J.S. | last2=Katsoulacos | first2=Y.S. | year=1991 | title=Competition, contestability, and predation:  the economics of competition in deregulated bus markets | journal=Transportation Planning and Technology | volume=15 | issue=2/4 | pages=263-275 | url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a773498960&amp;db=all | doi=10.1080/03081069108717458 | accessdate=2010-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In contrast, transit contracting in United States consists mostly of paratransit services, with only some fixed routes.

=== Curb Rights ===
Drawing on the experience of bus deregulation in the UK, as well as previous experience with private provision of transit the United States and around the world, Klein et al.&lt;ref name=Klein1997&gt;{{cite book | last1=Klein | first1=Daniel B. | last2=Moore | first2=Adrian T. | last3=Reja | first3=Binyam | year=1997 | title=Curb Rights:  A Foundation for Free Enterprise in Urban Transit | publisher=Brookings Institution | isbn=0-8157-4940-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; diagnosed the problems associated with private competition in bus transit as an absence of property rights.  Specifically, they suggest that fixed-route (though not necessarily fixed-schedule) transit services are able to function where operators have a right to pick up &lt;i&gt;congregations&lt;/i&gt; of passengers along a route.

The congregation function in urban transit is considered essential to establishing a market for transit services.  Klein et al. note that the establishment of private jitney services (services operating with smaller vehicles on relatively fixed routes, though not on fixed schedules) is common where there are substantial congregations of passengers at points along a route served by a regular, fixed-schedule service.  Particularly in &quot;thick&quot; transit markets, the fixed-schedule service acts as an &quot;anchor&quot; around which the private jitney operators target their service.  Klein et al. draw on a historical example from the US of jitney operations emerging during the 1910s and picking up passengers along the routes of streetcars, often running ahead of the scheduled streetcar arrivals&lt;ref name=Klein1997/&gt;.  However, problems may arise when there are no rights assigned to pick up passengers at particular locations and during particular time periods.  In the case of the streetcars, the issue was dealt with by the streetcar operators appealing to local governments to enforce their exclusive franchise rights and drive out the jitneys.  While this action may have (temporarily) preserved the streetcars' viability, it also drove out potential market entrants who were willing to provide valued services to customers.

In the case of thick markets, like the streetcar example, the problem of &quot;interloping&quot; (or inter-temporal poaching of passengers) by new market entrants like the jitney operators is not as severe.  If demand levels are sufficiently high, a route can sustain several competing operators.  However, when markets are &quot;thin&quot; (i.e. when demand levels are lower), the problem of interloping becomes more severe.  When a number of competing operators enter a thin market where scheduled service is provided, the anchor of the scheduled service may be &quot;dissolved&quot; by the competing operators.  Operators may be hesitant to invest in providing scheduled service if they cannot appropriate the returns from picking up congregations of passengers and are not protected from interloping competitors.  If interloping continues to occur in this kind of market, the result may be the destruction of the market altogether.  This process has been observed in many of the smaller cities in the UK following deregulation, where intense competition and frequent interloping have become destructive and resulted in a large amount of concentration among a limited number of operators.  

One possible solution to this problem that has been used in the past has been for a local government to offer exclusive rights to operate a particular route.  However, this type of arrangement creates many of the same problems typically associated with monopolies (higher prices, lack of innovation in service provision).  The role envisioned by Klein et al. for government is one of creating and enforcing property rights to serve passengers at particular locations and times (&quot;curb rights&quot;)&lt;ref name=Klein1997/&gt;.  The term &quot;curb right&quot; is used to denote the fact that the operator would have rights over a particular space along a street (a &quot;curb zone&quot;), including a bus stop area and the adjoining sidewalk, which would serve as a location for passengers to congregate.  These curb spaces could then be auctioned to private operators who wished to use them to pick up congregations of passengers.  The provision of rights over these congregations of passengers would ensure a minimal market to establish regular, scheduled service and protect this market from interlopers.  Klein et al also suggest the possibility of local governments protecting against monopoly abuse by reserving some curb zones as &quot;commons&quot; areas for jitney services when a single firm seeks to buy up all of the curb zones along a particular route, giving it a &lt;i&gt;de facto&lt;/i&gt; monopoly.  Where markets are sufficiently thick, the establishment of curb rights can also improve the quality of services by ensuring a market for both scheduled services and unscheduled, jitney operations.

== Road Privatization ==

Unlike buses, roads are not easily [[w:contestable market|contestable]].  Buses tend to have low fixed costs and higher variable costs, which implies few barriers to entry.  The roads most likely to be private (limited-access roads) under the framework discussed previously also tend to be more costly to provide and entail high fixed costs.  In this case, market power is a serious consideration.  Many limited-access highways function essentially as local monopolies, making the introduction of direct competition difficult.

Issues of competition can also be problematic in urban settings.  Where new private toll roads or road capacity are built in urban areas, the toll road must often compete with one or more free alternatives, making it difficult to attract sufficient traffic.  In the case of the privately-built [[w:91 Express Lanes|91 Express Lanes]] in Orange County, CA, the local topography made the provision of parallel routes difficult.  The primary competitor to the toll lanes was the parallel free lanes on the SR-91 freeway, which tend to become badly congested during the peak period.  After several years of operation, the worsening peak-period conditions on the free lanes led to growing public demands for additional capacity.  While the significant peak-period congestion ensured a market for the toll road, it also imposed a heavy economic cost on the users of the free lanes in the form of delays.  Since the lease agreement with the private operator prohibited the addition of untolled capacity, the Orange County Transportation Authority had no choice but to purchase the toll road and take over its operation. 

Other aspects of road networks can also make privatization difficult.  For example, on low volume roads, tolls often cannot recover costs.  This typically leads to other forms of financing.  One possibility is to finance such roads through general revenue sources, essentially treating them as local public goods.  Another is to adopt [[w:shadow toll|shadow tolls]] or other forms of availability payments.

Roads are also a long term investment, implying a need for guarantees of stability.  Long-term traffic forecasting is difficult and often involves large margins of error.  Uncertainty about future traffic demand translates into uncertainty regarding future revenue streams from road tolls.  Under private financing arrangements, risks associated with revenue uncertainty often get capitalized into interest rates, leading to higher borrowing costs.  Problems of uncertain traffic demand can be particularly acute when a private road is being built in a growing area, where future development is anticipated to form a significant part of the base of demand for the road.  An illustration of this problem is provided by the experience of the [[w:Virginia State Route 267#Dulles Greenway|Dulles Greenway]] in Loudoun County, Virginia, where the Greenway's original owners defaulted on their loan due to lower-than-projected demand and revenue.  


&lt;!--in Europe, many private roads have been nationalized--&gt;


=== Reluctance ===
Since the establishment of the publicly-owned National Highway System in the U.S. there has been continued reluctance to build new private roads or privatize existing roads.  There have been a handful of exceptions, however.  During the 1990s there were two notable projects that involved private ownership and financing:  [[w:91_Express_Lanes|California's SR91 Express Lanes]] and the [[w:Virginia State Route 267#Dulles Greenway|The Dulles Greenway]]).  More recently, the privately financed and developed [[w:California State Route 125|South Bay Expressway]] was completed in 2007 in the eastern suburbs of the San Diego region.  In addition, there have been a couple of cases where existing toll roads have been leased to private entities under long-term lease agreements (an example of the &quot;franchise&quot; framework discussed previously).  These types of arrangements have been agreed to for operation of the [[w:Chicago Skyway|Chicago Skyway]] and the [[w:Indiana Toll Road|Indiana Toll Road]].

There are several possible explanations for the reluctance to move toward greater privatization of roads in the U.S.:

* The reluctance may reflect apprehension toward privatization in general, due to some high-profile and problematic experiences with privatization and deregulation in other industries such as California's electricity deregulation and Britain’s experience with Railtrack.

* Private roads must offer a significant and apparent advantage over public control.  
* The burden of proof is on those who want to change the status quo.  They must prove why privatization would be beneficial to all interested parties. 
* The case for privatization must be compelling, and for most places to try it, it must have been done somewhere else first.
* Not just net gains, but also distributional effects must be considered.  Privatization may create winners and losers, and the losers are likely to be the most vocal opponents, complicating matters politically.

== Thought Question ==
&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;

The 2000 [[w:Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] Platform asserts &quot;Government interference in transportation is characterized by monopolistic restriction, corruption and gross inefficiency. We therefore call for the dissolution of all government agencies concerned with transportation, … We call for the privatization of …, public roads, and the national highway system. …&quot;

Is Government Ownership Characterized By:
* Monopolistic Restriction
* Corruption
* Gross Inefficiency

Would Private Ownership Be Characterized by:
* Monopolies
* Corruption
* Gross Inefficiency ?
&lt;/div&gt;

== Public Policy Questions ==

Should the freight railways continue to provide their own infrastructure ?  If yes, should they be subsidized to the extent that truckers are being subsidized indirectly ?   

What are the advantanges and disadvantages of creating a common rail infrastructure corporation ?

Should the governments (i.e., tax payers) subsidize a part of infrastructure costs ?

Should the extent of subsidy be equalized across all modes of transportation ?

If so, should we subsidize an equal amount per passenger-km or an equal proportion of the total modal costs ?

== Exercise ==

&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
Who should own Metro Transit? How should it be organized?
Work in pairs, identify alternative ownership regimes, discuss their merits.
&lt;/div&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to demonstrate a typical business application such as the creation of an Invoice.  The invoice must have date and Boolean data types and use a bind rule to automatically calculate invoice totals.  The invoice should have multiple line items, each with an amount.

== Method ==
We will use many of the standard XForms controls and a standard XForms style sheet to style the form.

== Screen Image ==

[[Image:XForms-invoice-screen-image.jpg]]

== Sample Application ==

[http://xforms-examples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/10-full-examples/88-invoice/invoice.xhtml Load Sample XForms Application]

== Sample Invoice Instance==

The following is a sample of an invoice document.  This document is typically sent by a supplier to a consumer of a product or service after confirmation that the products or services were delivered.

The top portion has items such as an invoice number, the date the invoice was sent to the customer and the from and to information.  It is then followed by a set of line items that specify the items delivered and their price.  At the end the line items are totaled and an indication made to see if the invoice was paid or not.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;Invoice&gt;
   &lt;InvoiceID&gt;123&lt;/InvoiceID&gt;
   &lt;InvoiceDate&gt;2008-10-10&lt;/InvoiceDate&gt;
   &lt;From&gt;
      &lt;OrganizationName&gt;Acme Services&lt;/OrganizationName&gt;
      &lt;OrganizationAddress&gt;123 Main St.
                  Anytown, MN 12345&lt;/OrganizationAddress&gt;
   &lt;/From&gt;
   &lt;To&gt;
      &lt;OrganizationName&gt;Acme Consumer&lt;/OrganizationName&gt;
      &lt;OrganizationAddress&gt;123 Main St.
                  Anytown, MN 12345&lt;/OrganizationAddress&gt;
   &lt;/To&gt;
   &lt;LineItems&gt;
      &lt;Item&gt;
         &lt;Description&gt;Widget 123&lt;/Description&gt;
         &lt;Amount&gt;100.00&lt;/Amount&gt;
      &lt;/Item&gt;
      &lt;Item&gt;
         &lt;Description&gt;Widget 456&lt;/Description&gt;
         &lt;Amount&gt;200.00&lt;/Amount&gt;
      &lt;/Item&gt;
      &lt;Item&gt;
         &lt;Description&gt;Widget 789&lt;/Description&gt;
         &lt;Amount&gt;300.00&lt;/Amount&gt;
      &lt;/Item&gt;
   &lt;/LineItems&gt;
   &lt;TotalAmount&gt;&lt;/TotalAmount&gt;
   &lt;InvoiceTermsCode&gt;net-30&lt;/InvoiceTermsCode&gt;
   &lt;PaidIndicator&gt;false&lt;/PaidIndicator&gt;
&lt;/Invoice&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== XForms User Interface ==
The interface to the Invoice uses input, textarea and select1 controls.  In addition, data types are assigned to the InvoiceDate and InvoicePaid indicator elements.



== XForms Application Source ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; xmlns:ev=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events&quot; xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;&gt;

            &lt;xf:label&gt;Paid:&lt;/xf:label&gt;
         &lt;/xf:input&gt;
         
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sample CSS File ==
The following CSS file required the input XForms application to add the newline class attribute for each control that appears on a new line.  This allows the repeat input items to not automatically flow to a new line.

&lt;source lang=&quot;CSS&quot;&gt;
@namespace xf url(&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;);
body {font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;}
textarea {font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;}

.newline {display:block; margin:5px 0;}

xf|input &gt; xf|label, xf|select &gt; xf|label, xf|select1 &gt; xf|label, xf|textarea &gt; xf|label 
{text-align:right; padding-right:10px; width:20ex; float:left; text-align:right;}

xf|group {border: solid black 1px; margin:15px 5px; padding:5px; background-color:lavender;}
.group-label {text-align:left; font-weight:bold; font-size:12pt;}

/* put each item on a new row */
.xf-repeat-item {padding: 3px; display:block;}

.Description, .Description .xf-value {text-align: left;}
.Description {width: 50ex; text-align: left;}
.Description .xf-value {width: 65ex; text-align: left;}

.Amount,  .Amount .xf-value{text-align: right;}
.Amount {width: 12ex;}
.Amount .xf-value {width: 16ex;}

/* add to remove spaces between table cells
table {border-collapse: collapse;} */
thead tr {background-color: silver;}
thead tr th {padding: 2px 5px;}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How Build Your First XRX Application ==
Although there are many different ways you can build an XRX application, there are two vital ingredients to get you started.  First you will need a way to create XQueries with [[w:REST|RESTFul]] interfaces.  The OpenSource native XML database [http://www.exist-db.org eXist] seems to be the favorite of most people although the [[w:Mark Logic#MarkLogic Server|MarkLogic]] server has a community version that is free as long as your data sets are under 10GB which seems to be enough for most pilot and learning projects.

The second component you will need is some client that will take an XForms data stream intended for a browser and build applications with it.  Because the XSLTForms client is now bundled with both eXist and MarkLogic and runs on all browsers many people are using this client.

If you need forms that need to load quickly without the overhead of loading the large XSLT transforms and JavaScript libraries, the FireFox XForms addon is also a very mature product, but does not run on FireFox versions higher than 3.0.12.

The Picoforms XForms client for IE and Chiba forms will also work very well.  If you are looking for a pure server-side transform you may want to look into Orbeon Forms or the IBM Workplace Forms tools.

There are five architectural tasks that you will need to master.  They go by phrase CRUDS: Create, Read, Update, Delete and Search.  Having a tool to quickly import XML data from spreadsheets is also very useful as you migrate more data into your XRX application server.  The oXygen XML editor is a favorite because is has strong support for the eXist database.

Once you have understood the basic concepts in the CRUDS cycle, you can then explore ways to optimize reports using XQuery and XQuery functions and modules.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein function/Antibodies|antibody]] (also known as immunoglobulin or Ig) is one of an animal's defense mechanisms. One type of antibody, Immunoglobulin G or IgG, has a Y-like structure consisting of two heavy chains and two light chains. The structures of antibodies are partially maintained by disulfide bonds, which link the heavy chains to heavy chains or heavy chains to light chains. The heavy chains always have the same sequence of [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]] while the light chains have varied sequences of amino acids. This variation is important to ensure that the antibody will be able to respond to various antigens, foreign substances that enter animal bodies (e.g.: foreign [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Carbohydrates/Polysaccharides|polysaccharides]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid|nucleic acids]], etc.). Antibodies are produced by the B cell, which is a type of white blood cell. B cells will allow the immune system to remember and react faster for future exposures. There are various types of antibodies, which are categorized based on the isotopes that the chains possess. Approximately five different types are discovered in mammals which each carry a special function and response based on the different types of bacteria that they encounter throughout the body. Each of the classes has identical light chains which is matched with a different heavy chain. Each of these classes of immunoglobulin has a specific function. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) is the first class of antibody to appear after exposure to an antigen. IgM has ten combining sites which enables it to bind extra well with antigens containing multiple identical epitopes. An example of avidity, which is the strength of an interaction that contains multiple independent binding interactions between matching antibody-antigen complex. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is the antibody that is involved in external secretions - tears and saliva - meaning it is the body's first line of defense against bacteria and viruses. The role of Immunoglobulin D (IgD) is still unknown. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) helps to protect against parasites. However, it also participates in allergic reactions.  The release of granules containing pharmacologically active molecules is triggered when the IgE - antigen complex forms cross-links with receptors on the surface of mast cells.  These antibodies are generated randomly using different gene segments which give a specific bind site for the antibody. They are also randomized by the mutations in the genes, making them even more complex and diverse. This relates to the humoral immune system (see below) that helps humans protect against the wide range of diversity in bacterias and viruses. There are two forms of antibodies: one that is soluble in the blood and fluids of the body and the other one that is attached to the B cell in general. The structure of the antibody includes a heavy chain and a light chain. The heavy chain has a constant region and a variable region and it is about 110 amino acids long. Antibodies first bind to the pathogens to prevent them from damaging cells. Second, they will try to remove pathogens using macrophages. Finally, they will stimulate other immune responses to further destroy the pathogens. The cells and proteins connected with this process are discussed below.

'''Immune Cell Response- Cells and Proteins Involved'''

The immune response system is composed of two corresponding systems, the ''humoral'' and ''cellular'' immune systems. The humoral immune system occurs primarily in body fluids, targeting bacterial infections and extracellular viruses. The humoral system can also react to individual foreign proteins. The cellular immune system attacks host cells infected by viruses as well as some parasite and foreign tissues. Both of these systems are prompted by a category of white blood cells called ''leukocytes,'' of which include macrophages (cells that ingest by phagocytosis) and lymphocytes (cells that release antibodies). In the cellular immune system, a class of T cells, called ''cytotoxic T cells'', are the main cells involved with reception of foreign cells or parasites. These cells have ''T cell receptors'' that are on the surface of cells and extend through the plasma membrane. When an antigen is deteected, either a T cell receptor or antibody will bind to a specific molecular structure in the antigen. This structure is referred to as antigenic determinant or an ''epitope'' (see ''Epitopes'' under ''Protein Function''). Helper T cells are also a part of the cellular immune system, generating ''cytokines'', a type of soluble signaling proteins. In ''clonal selection'', helper T cells are involved only indirectly, prompting the selective reproduction of the cytotoxic T cells and B cells that can bind to the certain antigen. 

In performing this response, antibodies can either be: 
*'''Monoclonal'''
*:One type of antibody responding to one type of antigen by recognizing one antigenic determinant.

[[Image:Monoclonal antibody.jpg|200px|frame|center|monoclonal antibody]]
*'''Polyclonal'''
*:Several type of antibody responding to one type of antigen by cooperatively recognizing various antigenic determinants on the antigen.
[[Image:Biochem-polyclonal.jpg|200px|frame|center|polyclonal antibody]]

'''Epitopes'''

Epitopes are the sites on a antigen that the immune system recognizes. It is also called an antigenic determinant. Both the host and foreign protein can produce epitopes that can bind to the paratopes of the B and T lymphocytes. An epitope can be either linear or conformational epitope. Linear epitotes are recognized by long chain of amino acids, or their primary structure: the sequence of the animo acids. Conformational epitopes are recognized by the antibodies by the 3-D structures of the epitopes. 

'''Antibody Folding'''

Recent studies have shown how antibodies fold. Foldings occur in the [[Cell Biology/Endoplasmic Reticulum|endoplasmic reticulum]] even before chains complete translation. Most of these studies are made by dissecting the antibody and letting it denaturalize and refold. IgGs are mostly used for these experiments. IgGs mostly form through adding a light chain to a heavy chain dimer between the CL and CH1 region. Dissection of IgGs light chain shows that there are three pathways of folding caused and limited to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proline proline] cis-trans isomerization. In general, most antibodies are formed through these three pathways after the C2-C3 sulfide bridge formed.

In equilibrium, most proteins have the accessible conformations, such as the native state, unfolded state, and non specific aggregates. However, At low pH (pH&lt;3), Antibodies have tendency to adopt specific additional conformation, called “alternating folded state”( though most other proteins are unfolded in this environment). Through spectroscopic, the structure is different from the nature state. However, it exhibits characteristic of the folded state ( e.g. stability against unfolding). The concern about this process is significant in biotechnology because antibody manufacturing process often include low pH steps, which can easily perform the “alternatively folded state”.
For some antibodies, another accessible state is the fibrillar amyloid structure, that  can lead to some protein-folding diseases. Fibrillar amyloid structure is a cross-beta structure in which fibrils are formed by beta-strand exchange of the individual subunits. Isolated LCs and truncated HCs form fibrils and are deposited in organs such as kidneys. The large quantity deposit can cause some fatal diseases when it interferes with physiological functions. E.g. A large deposit of monoclonal LCs prone to misfolding and the formation of amyloid  deposit can cause a fatal disease [light chain amyloidosis (AL)].The fibrilization mechanism is still under study . However, the mechanism in production of variable domains might generate less stable domain, therefore, can pass ER quality control but have a propensity to misfold outside the cell.  
B cell: a stage in which heavy and light chains are synthesized and expressed at cell surface via a transmembrance .
Heavy/light chain: constituent polypeptide chains of antibody molecules. Light chains are made up of two Ig domains. Heavy chains are made up of minimum of 3 Ig domains.
Ig domain: 100 amino acid-folding unit conserves twisted barrel-like-beta-sheet structure. It is stabilized by a buried intrachain disulfide bond.

'''Clonal Expansion'''

When the antibodies recognizes a specific antigen, the B cells clone itself and turn into 2 types of cells: the plasma cells and the memory cells. 
The plasma cells are effector cells that produce a large amount of a specific soluble antibody that attacks the target antigen.
Memory Cells are long lived cells that can be quickly activated to produce antibodies when the specific antigen is observed.

During the primary Immune response, that is the first time antibody attacks an antigen, it takes a long time for the antibody to make a large amount of plasma cells and memory cells when compared to the secondary response. During the secondary immune response, there is only a short time lag and the rate of Antibody produced is a lot greater. This is due to the memory cells activating the production of antibodies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">hmmmm

&quot;Although reversed phase chromatography and hydrophobic interaction chromatography are very similar, the ligands in reversed phase chromatography are much more hydrophobic than the ligands in hydrophobic interaction chromatography. This enables hydrophobic interaction chromatography to the use of more moderate elution conditions, which do not disrupt the sample nearly as much.&quot;

so this is really just HPLC but for less-polar proteins?  you still use the same apparatus?  I think this should be merged with the previous page, although I'm no expert.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Information==
'''Enzyme-linked Immunoabsorbent Assay (ELISA)''' is an analytical method utilizing various 
[[Structural_Biochemistry/Protein_function/Antibodies|antibodies]] to detect the presence of a compound in a wet or liquid sample. [[Structural_Biochemistry/Enzyme|Enzyme]] linked to the antibodies react with substrates to produce a color change, signifying the presence of desired substance, usually antigen.  The intensity of the color can be used to determine the concentration of substance of interest in a sample.  Antibodies are assayed to form a pure line of monoclonal antibodies that only detect the desired antigen or protein.

If the antibody-labeled enzyme is specific to another antibody, the indirect ELISA method is used whereas if the antibody-labeled enzyme can directly react with the antigen, sandwich method is preferred. 

==Indirect ELISA ==
[[Image:Indirect_ELISA_chem114a.jpg|thumbnail|right|Procedure of indirect ELISA]]
*'''Purpose''': Detect the presence of a type of antigen.
*'''Procedure'''
**Coat sample well with antigen.
**Add sample to coated well. If antibody of interest (Antibody A) is present in the sample, it will bind to the antigen. Wash out the remaining sample.
**Add a second antibody (Antibody B) to the sample. Antibody B is an antibody that will specifically bind to antibody A and is linked to a special enzyme. Wash out the remaining antibody B.
**Substrate is added to the mixture. This substrate will trigger a reaction with enzyme attached to antibody B to produce colored substance. 
**The rate at which the color changes is proportional to the amount of antigen in the solution. 
*'''Usage''': HIV Infection Test

== Sandwich ELISA ==
[[Image:Sandwich_ELISA_chem114a.jpg|thumbnail|right|Procedure of Sandwich ELISA]]
In the Sandwich ElISA, or two site capture assay, two different antibodies are used. The wells are coated with an antibody specific for one region of the antigen, then the test solution containing antigen is added. Following washing, the second antibody, which recognizes a different epitope of the antigen, will be added. This antibody will have the enzyme attach. 

*'''Purpose''': Detect the presence of a type of antigen.
*'''Procedure'''
**Coat sample well with monoclonal antibody (Antibody Z) that responds specifically to one type of antigen. 
**Add sample that might contain the antigen of interest (Antigen C) to the coated sample well. If sample contains Antigen C, it will bind to antibody Z. Wash out the remaining sample. 
**Add a second monoclonal antibody (Antibody Y), which also binds to Antigen C, to the well. This antibody is linked to a special enzyme. 
**Substrate, which reacts with enzymes on Antibody Y, is added. Reaction occurs and color change is observed.
**Presence of colored product confirms the presence of Antigen C. The intensity of the colored product can be used to determine the concentration of Antigen C. Also the rate of color change of the solution is proportional to the amount of antigen present.
*'''Application of sandwich ELISA''': Pregnancy tests

In the pregnancy test, the reaction zone will contain the primary antibody (usually a monoclonal mouse antibody IgG) that recognizes a portion of a unique beta chain of the pregnancy hormone called Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG). The secondary antibody conjugated with enzyme in the test zone recognizes the alpha chain. This chain can be found in luteinizing hormone (LH) which also present in non-pregnant women. It will display a color change in this test zone if the antigen was bound to both antibodies forming a sandwich. At last, a control zone contains antibody that binds to primary antibody (anti-IgG). A color change in this zone will show that our test was correctly preformed.

{{BookCat}}
== Competitive ELISA ==
[[File:Immunometric Assay.jpg|thumbnail|Example of homogenous competitive immunoassay]][[File:Comp_B.jpg|thumbnail|Example of heterogeneous competitive immunometric assay]]
Competitive ELISA is another method of ELISA that involves competitive binding process. 
*'''Procedure'''
**Incubate unlabeled antibody within presence of its antigen.
**Bound antibody/antigens are added to a antigen coated well.
** Wash and remove unbound antibodies.
**Competition results from the fact that the more antigens are present in the sample, the less antibody will be able to bind.
**A secondary antibody that is coupled to a enzyme is added.
**Substrate added for signal
**The weaker colored or fluorescent signal that is released shows that that the original antigen concentration was high.

==Reverse ELISA==
Reverse ELISA is a relatively new technique specifically created to investigate the West Nile virus envelope protein and how it is able to detect virus-specific antibodies. This newer technique uses an solid phase made up of an immunosorbent polystyrene rod with ogives. The entire device is immersed in a test tube containing the collected sample and the following usual steps such as washing, incubation in conjugate and incubation in chromogenous are performed through dipping the micro-wells with the prepared sample concentration.

The advantage of Reverse ELISA over other ELISA techniques is how sensitive the test can detect different reagents, which is beneficial for detecting different kinds of antibodies with their respective antigens with large target assays. The sample volume can be increased to improve the test sensitivity in clinical (saliva, urine), food (bulk milk, pooled eggs) and environmental (water) samples. One ogive is left unsensitized to measure the non-specific reactions of the sample. The use of laboratory supplies for dispensing sample aliquots, washing solution and reagents in microwells is not required, facilitating ready-to-use lab-kits and on-site kits. Based on the platform of ELISA, this method uses an antibody microarray to capture native antigens. Autoantibody reactivity is then evaluated by differentially labeling patient IgG and incubating these antibodies with the native antigens that are immobilized on the antibody microarray.

*'''Procedure'''
**Preparation: Prepare autoantibodies (IgG) separated and purified from serum. Label them either through radioactive tagging or a fluorescent dye.
**Extraction: Label autoantibodies with native protein on array. Native antigens bound to antibodies on array are extracted from microarray with unique monoclonal antibodies. Array should be incubated with native protein extracts such as cells, tissue, or body fluid, etc.
**Analysis: Analyze concentration based on intensity of dye appearing in the assay. When the process is complete, the assay is then evaluated by its intensity of color which is determined for each well. The amount of color produced correalates to the amount of primary antibody bound to the proteins on the bottom of the microwells</text>

      <comment>/* Structural Biochemistry */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Structural Biochemistry is the field of biochemistry that focuses mainly on the components, functions, and structures of molecules of cells within living organisms. It helps us understand cells through the theories of  [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemistry|Chemistry]] and the laws of  [[Structural Biochemistry/Physics|Physics]]. Structural biochemistry concentrates on the study of  [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Types of Macromolecules|macromolecules]] (such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Carbohydrates|carbohydrates]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Proteins|proteins]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Carbohydrates/Polysaccharides|polysaccharides]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids|lipids]]), their monomeric units ([[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid|nucleic acids]], nucleotides) and important reactions involving them.

Biochemistry is interlinked between Biology and [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemistry|Chemistry]]. Biology is the study of the cell’s interaction within its environment. [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemistry|Chemistry]] takes these interactions and breaks it down to the molecular level and provides information on how these events occur. Structure is defined by how a system is composed. It is the way in which parts are arranged or put together to form the whole. As a result, when these two subjects are fused, Biochemistry and Structure, the subject known as Structural Biochemistry comes into being. Structural Biochemistry forms the basis of the molecular parts via interactions such  [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrogen bonds|hydrogen]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Ionic interaction|ionic]], and [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Covalent bonds|covalent bonding]] that form the cellular structure.

==Structural Biochemistry==

'''Structural biochemistry''' is a study of various macromolecules and how their structure is appropriate to their functions. [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Types of Macromolecules|Macromolecules]] studied in structural biochemistry courses that consists of [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Carbohydrates|carbohydrates]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids|lipids]], and nucleotides. They cover everything from the multitude of functions that proteins participate in (such as transport of molecules, cytoskeleton formation, and cell growth) to the building blocks of [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]], and even to the catalytic mechanism of different [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzyme]]. All [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Types of Macromolecules|macromolecules]] in general contribute to the survival of humans, as well as to the composition of inanimate objects. 

Another way to define structural biochemistry is by stating that it is the scientific study of the biochemical systems of life and living organisms; it is about biological molecules that construct chemical forms, and the close correlation between structure and function. Furthermore, biochemistry applies chemistry to biological studies at the cellular and molecular level. It surfaces as a distinct category at the turn of the 20th century, as scientists combined chemistry, physiology, and biology to explore the chemistry of living environments and systems. Using this field, biochemical scientists have been attempting to understand and explain the many chemical mechanisms and biological structures shared by living organisms, and to formulate some basic organizing principles shared by all forms of life as well.

Today, biochemistry is considered as the study of life in its chemical processes; the study of both a life science and a chemical science. It investigates the chemistry of living organisms and the molecular basis for the alteration happening in the living cells. It uses the schemes of [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemistry|Chemistry]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Physics|Physics]], molecular biology and [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Immunology; Another Approach toward Protein Investigation|immunology]] to study the structure and behavior of the complex molecules found in biological material such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]] in a protein, a large organic compound.  Along those lines, it also explores the ways these molecules interact to form cells, tissues, and whole organisms. The biochemist seeks to determine how specific molecules such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Protein Function|protein]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid|nucleic acids]]
, [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids|lipids]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemistry of important organic molecules in Biochemistry/Vitamins and Cofactors|vitamins]], and hormones function in such processes. Particular emphasis is placed on regulation of the chemical reactions in the living cells. 

Biochemistry has become the foundation for understanding all biological processes. It has presented explanations for the sources of many diseases in humans, animals, and plants alike through laboratory techniques such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification/High Pressure Liquid chromatography|chromatography]], and [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein sequence determination techniques/Mass Spectroscopy|spectroscopy]]. It can frequently propose ways by which such diseases may be treated or cured. Because biochemistry community is interested in unraveling the complex chemical reactions that occur in a wide variety of life forms, it offers the basis for practical advances in [[Structural Biochemistry/Medicine &amp; Drug Design|medicine]], veterinary medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology. It also includes such exciting new fields as molecular genetics and bioengineering. The knowledge and methods developed by biochemists are applied to in all fields of medicine, for example, in agriculture and in many chemical and health related industries. The structural biochemistry helped to fight the AIDS epidemic because the structure of HIV protease, which should be blocked in order to prevent virus spreading, could be used as a reference to determine the types of molecules that might block the enzyme. Also, it helped patients with arthritis through the study of painkillers such as ibuprofen at the molecular level and by creating a new painkiller to shut down COX-2 so that ulcers would not form, and therefore prevent the side effects.

Biochemistry is also unique in providing education and research in protein structure or function and genetic engineering, the two basic components of the rapidly expanding field of biotechnology.  As the broadest of the basic sciences, biochemistry includes many subspecialties such as neurochemistry, bioorganic chemistry, clinical biochemistry, physical biochemistry, molecular genetics, biochemical pharmacology, and immunochemistry.

== Distinguishing Features of Living Organisms ==

** &lt;b&gt;Complex Internal Structures, there is a high degree of chemical complexity and microscopic organization.&lt;/b&gt; Thousands of molecules allow cells to maintain a very intricate internal structure, which include long polymers, each with characteristic sequences of subunits, its unique 3D structure and specific selection of binding sites.
**&lt;b&gt;Systems are able to maintain equilibrium by extracting, transforming and using energy from the environment.&lt;/b&gt; This enables organisms to do mechanical, chemical and osmotic work.
**&lt;b&gt;Reproduction, with defined function of organism's components, organisms are interacting with one another&lt;/b&gt; The interplay between organism have allowed changed in components that cause coordination and compensation to necessary adaptation to environment.
**&lt;b&gt;Mechanisms for sensing and responding to alterations in organism environments&lt;/b&gt; A constant adjusting of internal chemistry in order to adapt to change in their local environment for better survival.
**&lt;b&gt;Ability for precise self-replication and self-assembly&lt;/b&gt;Construction of entirely complete genetic material in each and every individual cell unique to the organism.
**&lt;b&gt;A capability to evolve over time &lt;/b&gt; This fundamental unity of the living organism is reflected at the molecular level in similarities of gene sequences and protein structures.

This template is used to show a table of questions with answers in the print version of the [[Spanish by Choice]] wikibook. It is used like this:

&lt;pre&gt;{{SbcQuestionPrint
| &lt;question1&gt; | &lt;answer1&gt;
| &lt;question2&gt; | &lt;answer2&gt;
...
| &lt;question20&gt; | &lt;answer20&gt;
}}&lt;/pre&gt;

While you can specify less than 20 question answer pairs, it is not possible to specify more than 20 pairs. This template is usually used together with [[Template:SbcQuestion]] for the normal version.

      <text xml:space="preserve">For a long time, up until about the 1960s, those who were deaf were taught to [[w:speechread|speechread]], often being banned from using visual language in residential schools. Signed languages were not seen as proper languages; it was thought they were highly [[w:Iconicity|iconic]] systems of [[w:Gesture|gesture]] or [[w:Mime artist|mime]].

However, that is not the case. Beginning with the work of [[w:William Stokoe|William Stokoe]] in the 1960s, it was discovered that signed languages (in this case, American Sign Language) has properties corresponding to those of spoken language. Both spoken and signed languages have
;[[w:Phonology|Phonology]]:In spoken languages, this refers to the smallest units of meaningful sound, and their characteristics. In signed languages, it refers to the smallest units of meaningful sign, and their characteristics.
;[[w:Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]]:The smallest units of meaning. The word &quot;dog&quot; is one morpheme (it cannot be subdivided into smaller units of meaning) but three phonemes (&lt;code&gt;/d/&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/ɑ/&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/ɡ/&lt;/code&gt;).
;[[w:Semantics|Semantics]]:The meaning imparted by the arbitrary symbols of language.
;[[w:Syntax|Syntax]]:The rules for combining morphemes into correctly-formed sentences.
;[[w:Pragmatics|Pragmatics]]:The social rules for using language. For example, it is often considered taboo to curse in the presence of females.

Recent research has revealed more of ASL's complexity, confirming time and again that it is a natural language.

So, American Sign Language is a true language, just like any of the spoken languages you are familiar with. However, contrary to popular belief, sign language is not international. Wherever communities of deaf people exist, sign languages develop. Before ASL was recognized as a real language, deaf students were often sent to residential schools where they were banned from using signed languages. Nevertheless, children would create their own sign languages with arbitrary symbols, rich grammar. Similarly, there are many examples of families creating their own sign language to communicate with deaf children. Finally, the case of [[w:Martha's Vineyard Sign Language|Martha's Vineyard Sign Language]] is a well known example of a signed language spontaneously developing out of need.

As with spoken languages, signed languages vary from country to country, and are not based on the spoken language in the country of origin. Like spoken languages, they developed over long periods of time, and are constantly changing. They continue to do so today.

American Sign Language is the dominant sign language in the United States, Canada and parts of Mexico, as well as smaller populations throughout the rest of the world - however it is ''not'' universal. Even in other English-speaking countries like Britain, ASL is not used. In Britain, BSL ([[w:British Sign Language|British Sign Language]]) is used, and is unintelligible to ASL signers and vice versa. ASL is more closely related to LSF ([[w:French Sign Language|Langue des Signes Française]]) for historical reasons.

American Sign Language is usually abbreviated ASL (it is rarely referred to as Ameslan as well). As with other sign languages, its grammar and syntax are separate and distinct from the spoken language(s) spoken in its area of influence. Its origins have been traced to the turn of the 19th Century and include French Sign Language and the sign language of the residents of Martha's Vineyard. Since there is no commonly-used written form of ASL, there may be other underdocumented influences on the language.

Although it often seems as though the signs are meaningful of themselves, in fact they are as arbitrary as words in spoken language. For example, hearing children often make the mistake of using &quot;you&quot; to refer to themselves, since others refer to them as &quot;you.&quot; Children who acquire the sign &lt;code&gt;YOU&lt;/code&gt; (pointing at one's interlocutor) make similar mistakes - they will point at others to mean themselves, indicating that even something as seemingly explicit as pointing is an arbitrary sign in ASL, like words in a spoken language.

This template can be used to graphically show how to make words using the manual alphabet:

&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{Manual_letters|L|I|K|E| |T|H|I|S}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Which generates:
{{Manual_letters|L|I|K|E| |T|H|I|S}}
The letters must be in all caps, and the template can handle up to 15 letters.  If you need more letters, you should use a new line anyhow - just use the template again on the next line.

      <comment>/* XForms */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Standing on the Shoulders of Giants ==
The XRX architecture did not appear overnight.  It was only made possible by the diligent work of many standards organizations over many years.  Clearly the XML standard is one that enabled most of the key technologies.  But the role of HTML, HTTP, CSS, XPath, XML Schema, XSLT, XForms, REST, Schematron and XQuery and other standards created by the W3C really must be appreciated to understand the true scope of the standardization efforts.  Here is a brief overview of these technologies and a rough order that they were created and could be learned.

== XML Syntax ==
The syntax of using &quot;less than&quot; and &quot;greater than&quot; characters to bracket data elements embedded in a text document goes back to early markup languages such as SGML.  SGML was the language that the HTML standard was modeled on.  SGML was a complex standard that required the user to be familiar with many technologies, so in 1997 an effort was made to simplify the standard and the XML standard was first published by the W3C.

== XPath ==
The XPath language is a smaller data-selection language that is used extensively within other XML standards.  Both our client technology (XForms) and our server technology (XQuery) heavily depend on using XPath to surgically remove the elements we want from much larger XML tree structures.  If you are familiar with UNIX or web file system paths you may already have a good mental model for how XPath expressions work.  For the purposes of this book we will be using mostly very simple XPath expressions that merely narrow XML data sets using &quot;child&quot; paths and &quot;where&quot; paths called predicates.

== XForms ==
Although this wikibook is not intended to be a book on XForms, the use of XForms makes client application development very consistent with the rest of the material in this book.  We will cover just enough background to help you understand the key architectural features of XForms and how it leverages REST interfaces to get and submit data to the server.  Technically you can still benefit from the XRX architecture without using any XForms applications on the client but you may find that you duplicate most of the components that are already in XForms when you do this.  Central to the concepts in XForms are the MVC architecture, Binding, the dependency graph and declarative submission elements.  If you are a fan of JavaScript and AJAX, you can implement much of the functionality of XForms using these tools.  But this topic is not covered in this wikibook.  In fact many people use XRX architecture specifically to avoid having to learn JavaScript and the myriad of JavaScript frameworks that are popular today.

== XQuery ==
Anyone who is familiar with the SQL language understands the role of the SELECT statement in selecting the appropriate tables, columns and rows from a relational database.  XQuery on the surface may seem only like a version of SQL for XML databases.  Because XQuery can be easily extended, however, it has taken on a much larger role then just a reporting language for XML databases. XQuery may be the only server language that a developer will ever need.  Because it can be easily extended, it has already been extended in hundreds of useful ways.

The first major extension has been the ability of XQuery to update XML data.  This was considered important to the original XQuery authors, but they decided to focus on data selection first and data updating second.

== CSS ==
One of the most elegant aspects of the XForms model is that it was designed from the ground up to work with the W3C's Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) standard.  Thus, almost every aspect of how web application controls are arranged on the screen can be managed by a single site-wide CSS file.  The consequence is that if you decide to make a site-wide change, only a single file needs to be altered.  The downside is that the level of CSS support varies dramatically in many browsers.  Since XForms is implemented as a separate namespace and CSS is designed to be namespace aware, most modern style sheets for XForms leverage this basic feature.  The challenge is that not all browsers have implemented the CSS namespace functionality.  This issue is complex and any XRX architecture that is building applications to support older browsers must take these caveats into consideration.

*{{keep}}. Although this isn't firm. We can have pages and books here about proprietary software, think about Microsoft Office. If the tool is genuinely useful for the purposes at hand, and if it's both common and popular, we likely should have a book describing it's use. If this is not the case, maybe it should be deleted. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:58, 24 August 2008 (UTC)
*[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment'''. I think we will have difficulty in assessing how useful or popular the software itself really is, as few of us here will have used the tool(s). I am only basing my view on the material in the wikibook, which at present seems little different from a publicity brochure. I would be more persuaded that the book had potential to grow into something useful if the authors gave a plan for the contents showing the educational material they intend to provide. As it is a new book perhaps we could give it more time to develop, while at the same time steering the authors in the right direction.

*[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' - The current content is little more than talking points off a brochure. However, there is no reason we can't have a book on this topic.

I've emailed the author; perhaps they can provide information to help us decide what action to take here, if any. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:55, 2 September 2008 (UTC)
*{{keep}}. When dealing with commercial (or other for profit subjects) the only requirement that I think we should have is that in respect to projects, that they don't serve as simple advertisements. In subpages (like this one), links or references, if in context to the book, I see no reason to discriminate and prevent people from adding useful information.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:32, 2 September 2008 (UTC)
*{{keep}}. The page do not seems to contain many promotional information and in fact we have to be fair on this issue. I.E. if we consider this page of no use, we should delete other similar product pages such as SDL Trados, which obviously contained typical promotional style of texts like &quot;is the world's most popular.... It provides industry standard technology to accelerate the translation process, ...is of the highest standard.&quot;. Or, if we really don't want this style of page to exist, we should give clear instruction to the composers of all similar pages what kind of information we prefer them to offer on such pages. Again, we just have to be fair. --[[User:john_zhu|John]] ([[User talk:john_zhu|talk]]) 01:44, 4 September 2008 (UTC)
*:[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' Things like &quot;the world's most popular&quot; and &quot;is of the highest standard&quot; probably should be removed from all pages as being promotional, violating NPOV, factually inaccurate, and/or as not being educationally usefully, but those are things that can be easily fixed and does not require a solution as extreme as deletion. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:25, 4 September 2008 (UTC)
*{{comment}} I think John Zhu puts forward some reasonable arguments for his book/pages. Now he is part of this discussion, it would be nice to hear some more about his plans for the educational content. Also, I don't know if he is connected with this Singaporean company who make the software, but if somebody were so connected would that have any implications for the licensing of the material? For example if a person employed by the company provides material, wouldn't that require the company to formally waive their rights over the work of their employee? (Others might like to comment.) [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 16:59, 6 September 2008 (UTC)
*{{comment}} I find it rather strange that John Zhu has not come forward with any further justification of his book/pages. This leads me to the conclusion that he probably is closely connected with or employed by the company who sell the software and has no intention to develop the material any further than its present incarnation as a piece of commercial advertising. However, I am quite willing to be proved wrong in this, if any evidence to the contrary were to be produced. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 21:31, 13 September 2008 (UTC)
*{{comment}} John Zhu is an employee of the tool maker. He works for Heartsome Technologies Ltd.

      <comment>clean up, typos fixed: imperceptable → imperceptible using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This howto is sort of a combination of two very helpful posts, both by SA regarding finding where an engine is generally happy.

[http://forum.aempower.com/forum/index.php?topic=10624.30 (injector phasing)]
[http://forum.aempower.com/forum/index.php?topic=6143.60 (optimum AFR)]

Ideally this test should be run on a dyno under a constant load but you can still get pretty good results without one.

Steps (all performed at closed throttle):

# Disable Idle FB
# Use the idle tables to force the idle speed up to ~1000 RPM
# Log parameters Engine Speed, Engine Load, Fuel Inj #01 Open, and optionally AFR at the fastest rate.
# Open injector phasing, set the 3 RPM breakpoints nearest 1000 RPM to 0 degrees in the advance table (typically 500, 1000, and 1500) for all loads
# View the parameter Fuel Inj #01 Open so you see roughly how it corresponds to Injector Phase
# Set the injector phase below what your basemap indicates by a few teeth
# Start logging data
# Increase the Injector Phase teeth step by step (I started with .25 increments) until you're well above the basemap's phase setting (I went from 5 to 9 teeth on my 24 tooth, base was 7).  Remember to hit &lt;enter&gt; after specifying the next increment.
# While you change the phase, the engine RPM should first start to increase.  It will hit a peak then it will start to fall off again.  It may be very slight and almost imperceptible, but the logs should make it obvious.
# Stop logging.

Look at the data.  Now there's a lot of assumptions that have to made here...there's nothing wrong with the engine, the ignition system is functioning correctly, etc., etc.

In general, with no influence from the IAC system, your engine RPM should peak and your manifold pressure (Engine Load) should drop at the best Injector Phase.  In order to see the fine detail you'll probably have to set your logging view to a smaller scale -- like 900 min / 1200 max for RPM, and -11psi min / -9psi max for engine load for example.  The two should peak and dip (respectively) near the same place.  Note the Fuel Inj #01 Open setting at this spot and set the injector phase to achieve this same number.

You can repeat this process with a smaller tooth window for finer detail.  I did from 8-9 teeth at .1 increments and then 8.8 to 9.2 in .05 increments.

This will give you a baseline injector phase for 1000RPM at 0 degrees and give you room in both directions for injector advance and retard, although you'll probably just be retarding only for 500 rpm and advancing from here up the RPM range.

Next do the same process at ~2000 RPM and instead of adjusting the Injector Phase teeth, adjust the injector phase table values for 2000 RPM (along with the nearest RPM breakpoints -- usually 1500 and 2500).  You'll also need to change your logging parameters to watch Inj Advance rather than Fuel Inj #01 Open.  You don't need to test more than 0-100 degrees of advance for the 2000RPM mark.

Once these two points are adequate you can extrapolate up and down from the 1000 and 2000 RPM breakpoints to get a good advance map according to what the engine has told you it wants.  Keep in mind, phasing makes little difference in high RPMs because of increased duty cycle.  But I mostly did this to help with low RPM throttle response. It's additional side effects include easier starting and smoother
idle. 

I did cheat a little on additionally sloping advance upward as engine load increases (to compensate for longer injector pulsewidth) by using some math and a spreadsheet because I don't have an easy way of loading the engine at those test speeds standing still (besides turning on my A/C)  tongue  Most of that stuff can be found in the Injector Phasing sticky at the top of this forum.

[[File:Endergonic.jpg|right|350px|endergonic reaction]] 

An '''endergonic reaction''' refers to a chemical reaction in which energy is being used in the overall reaction, making the reaction non-spontaneous and thermodynamiacally unfavorable. Energy is being absorbed as the reaction proceeds, and there is a net loss of energy in the surrounding system. Due to this consumption of energy, standard change in [[Structural Biochemistry/Free energy|Gibbs free energy]]''' (ΔG)''' is a positive value under constant pressure and temperature: '''ΔG° &gt; 0'''.

The magnitude of ΔG also represents the quantity of energy required to drive the reaction. If a chemical process is  [[Structural Biochemistry/Exergonic reaction|exergonic]] in one direction, then the reverse process must be endergonic. Plants get the required energy to make sugar from the environment by capturing light and converting it into chemical energy that can be used for other processes.


Some examples of endergonic reactions are muscle contractions and protein synthesis.

The equilibrium constant of endergonic reaction where ΔG° &gt; 0 is less than 1: '''K &lt; 1'''.

Endergonic reactions require an input of energy, usually larger than those of non spontaneous [[Structural Biochemistry/Exergonic reaction|exergonic reactions]], from an outside source to disturb the chemical equilibrium to cause changes, such as bond formation. This input of energy is called the '''activation energy'''. In certain reactions, a '''catalyst''' is available to speed up endergonic reactions. A catalyst can lower the activation energy barrier for the reaction. Thus, it speeds up the reaction process. The energy for an endergonic reaction is obtained by coupling the reaction with an exergonic reaction.

A familiar example of coupling exergonic reactions to endergonic reactions to promote spontaneity comes from ATP. ATP powers cellular work by coupling exergonic reactions to endergonic reactions. It is responsible for mediating most energy coupling in cells, and in most cases, acts as the immediate source of energy that powers cellular work. The synthesis of the amino acid glutamine from glutamic acid and ammonia is naturally endergonic and non spontaneous with a ΔG value of +3.4 kcal/mol but coupling this reaction with the exergonic process of ATP hydrolysis, -7.3 kcal/mol, will drive the reaction forward, making it spontaneous. In the same sense, a exergonic reaction must be coupled with the formation of ATP from ADP in order to make the reaction spontaneous and in most cases, cellular respiration provides the energy for the endergonic process of making ATP and plants use light energy, instead, to produce ATP. 


An endergonic reaction can simply be understood by studying the following situation.
In a chemical reaction, the reactants make products and an equilibrium is reached. An endergonic reaction is one where more products are made from the equilibrium amount by disturbing the equilibrium with a form of energy. For example, heat will be absorbed into the system and the equilibrium will shift to the right (towards product side). Consequently, more products will be formed.

==Summary==

An endergonic reaction:
*The free energy of initial state &lt; free energy of final state
*Energy needs to be put into the system in order to go from the initial start to the final state
*+G

[[File:Exergonic.jpg|right|350px|exergonic reaction]]

An '''exergonic reaction''' refers to a reaction where energy is released. Because the reactants lose energy (G decreases), Gibbs free energy (ΔG) is negative under constant temperature and pressure. These reactions usually do not require energy to proceed, and therefore occur spontaneously. In a chemical reaction, breaking and forming bonds between atoms is a form of energy. Since chemical reactions mainly consist of forming and/or breaking chemical bonds, exergonic reactions release energy by breaking less stable chemical bonds and forming more stable bonds.
The example of exergonic reactions occur in our body is cellular respiration: C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6 O2 -&gt; 6 CO2 + 6 H2O this reaction release energy which is used for cell activities. 


However, some exergonic reactions do not occur spontaneously and require a small input of energy to start the reaction. This input of energy is called '''activation energy'''. Once the activation energy requirement is fulfilled by an outside source, the reaction proceeds to break bonds and release more energy than was needed to start the reaction. This results in a net gain in energy in the surrounding system, and a net loss in energy from the reaction system; hence, the change in '''Gibbs free energy (ΔG)]''' is '''negative (ΔG &lt; 0)'''. A negative ΔG denotes that the reaction is '''spontaneous''' and '''thermodynamically favorable'''.

Here is an endergonic reactions of ATP give energy.
First Breaking down the ATP formed ADP and Pi is an ecergonic reaction, wheat Delta G is less than 0. However, by combining the reaction glucose+Pi ---&gt; glucose 6-phosphate, a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction. The cell can drive an endergonic reaction.

==Conclusion==

[[File:Exergonic.png|thumbnail]]

Exergonic reaction is &lt;br /&gt;
*Free energy of final state &lt; free energy of initial state &lt;br /&gt;
*Free energy is free during the reaction&lt;br /&gt;
*The energy can be used to do biological work&lt;br /&gt;
*Able to work in spontaneous reaction&lt;br /&gt;
*doesn’t have to occur in great rate which is where the enzyme comes in&lt;br /&gt;
*-G (negative number) &lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Background and Definition==
Depth-first search is an algorithm used to find information represented in a graphical format. The first version of depth-first search, originally called Tremaux’s algorithm, was designed as a means of solving mazes in the nineteenth century (Stewart, 1999).  [The] “theoretical properties of  Tremaux’s maze solving method,” however, where not discovered in the field of computer science until 1970 when John Hopcroft and Robert Tarjan collaborated, using depth-first search to “obtain linear time algorithms” (Tarjan, 1972, p.  146).

An algorithm, a word originally coined by mathematician Mohammed ibn-Musa al-Khwarizmi in the late 700s CE, is a procedure or formula used to find a solution to a problem (Berardi, Kroon, McDermott &amp; Newton, 2006). Algorithms work with various inputs; these inputs often vary in the amount of information they contain. A good algorithm must be able to efficiently organize input of any length into basic functional steps that can be stored in the memory of the program (“PC”, 2008).
Hopcroft and Trajan’s linear time algorithms equalized the size of the input to the amount of resources and time spent by the program to solve a particular problem (Tarjan, 1972). 

The depth-first search algorithm is used to vertically traverse nodes of information of a graph formatted in a tree structure.  Beginning with a single node at the top of the graph, the search moves to each subsequent node, vertically, starting with the left-most side of the tree structure until the search reaches the bottom-most node of the tree structure. The search does not move horizontally from left to right until the search of each node on one segment of the tree structure is complete (Siek &amp; Lee, 2000).

One of the most important features for a depth-first search is the ability to keep track of the nodes that have already been visited. The following pseudocode allows for this feature.

&lt;pre&gt;
DFS(u):

visit(u);
time = time + 1;
d[u] = time;
color[u] = grey;

for all nodes v adjacent to u do
   if color[v] == white then
      p[v] = u;
       DFS(u);


time = time + 1;
f[u] = time;
color[u] = black;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Created by Kravitz, David and Lafferty (1997) this pseudocode shows how a depth first search algorithm works by efficiently keeping track of the nodes already visited and the nodes still left to explore. Kravitz et al. made each node to be explored white, each node being explored grey, and each node that had been explored black. The color coding of the nodes allows the user the track the progress of the search algorithm as well as keeping an accurate data map of which nodes have already been stored.
The first line in the code initializes the depth first search, starting with the left most tree segment on the graph.

 DFS(u):

This block of code allows the search engine to visit every node on the left most tree segment of the tree structure, turning the nodes from white to grey as they are searched one time.

&lt;pre&gt;
visit(u);
time = time + 1;
d[u] = time;
color[u] = grey;
&lt;/pre&gt;

This block of code moves the search across the tree structure horizontally, from left to right once every node on the left side of the tree structure has been searched once. In other words, the algorithm moves toward the white nodes. When the algorithm is done searching a node, the node is turned black, and the algorithm cannot re-search that node again.

&lt;pre&gt;
for all nodes v adjacent to u do
   if color[v] == white then
      p[v] = u;
       DFS(u);


time = time + 1;
f[u] = time;

==Practical Application==
One practical application for depth-first search is “an algorithm to determine whether a graph in planar”  (“Graph,” 2008). Basically a planar graph can be drawn in a plane without graph edges crossing (Weisstein, 2008). Depth-first search enables the user to organize the information represented in the graph “by post-order traversal of the tree [structure]” (“Planar,” 2008). In other words, depth-first search gives the user the ability to decide the order they want to “embed back edges from” the first node to each following node. If, during this process, the user decides that a certain grouping of nodes have potential  connections to other nodes not presently represented on the tree structure graph, then the user will know that that particular tree segment must  “be kept on the external face” of the planar graph (“Planar,” 2008).

===Problem===
In depth-first search “each node has two times associated with it: the discovery time and the finish time” (Kravitz, David &amp; Lafferty, 1997). If the search parameter is large (i.e., a large amount of nodes) then “the storage required for all of these times becomes” quickly unmanageable (Kravitz, David &amp; Lafferty, 1997).

= Question 1 =

Find the names of experiments performed by Prof. Pain after Jan 1, 2004.

== Answer ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT name
FROM Experiments
WHERE whoperformed = 'Prof. Pain'
AND date &gt; '2004-01-01';
&lt;/source&gt;


= Question 2 =

Find the names of genes that were either positively expressed twofold or more with a significance of at least 1.0, in some experiment, or negatively expressed twofold or less with a significance of at least 1.0, in some experiment. List them alongside their organisms in a two-column format.

== Answer ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT Genes.gid, name, level, significance
FROM Expression, Genes
WHERE Expression.gid = Genes.gid
AND significance &gt;= 1.0
AND (level &gt;= 2.0 OR level &lt;= 2.0);
&lt;/source&gt;

= Question 3 =

What is the grandparent category of 'glycine binding'?

== Answer ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT Parents.parent_category
FROM GOTree as Children, GOTree as Parents
WHERE Children.category = 'glycine binding'
AND Children.parent_category = Parents.category;
&lt;/source&gt;

= Question 4 =

Find the names of experiments that were performed before some Gasch experiment.

== Straightforward Answer ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT E1.name
FROM Experiments AS E1, Experiments AS E2
WHERE E1.date &lt; E2.date
AND E2.whoperformed = 'Gasch';
&lt;/source&gt;

== Subquery Answer ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT name
FROM Experiments
WHERE Experiments.date &lt; (
    SELECT MAX(date)
    FROM Experiments
    WHERE whoperformed = 'Gasch'
);
&lt;/source&gt;

= Question 5 =

Find the names of pine genes that were positively expressed more than 0.5-fold (with a significance of 1.0 or more) in at least two experiments. 

== Straightforward Answer ==

First, we must find the experiments where genes are upreglated and significant.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE VIEW Upregulated AS
SELECT gid, experimentid
FROM Expression
WHERE significance &gt;= 1.0
AND level &gt;= 0.5;
&lt;/source&gt;

Next, we must determine the genes which were upregulated in at least two experiments. We do this by taking the product of the upregulated genes and selecting rows where the gene ID is the same but the experiment ID is different.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE VIEW UpInTwoOrMore AS
SELECT DISTINCT U1.gid AS gid
FROM Upregulated AS U1, Upregulated AS U2
WHERE U1.gid = U2.gid
AND U1.experimentid &lt;&gt; U2.experimentid;
&lt;/source&gt;

Finally, we determine which of these genes come from pine, and project their names.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT name
FROM Genes, UpInTwoOrMore
WHERE Genes.gid = UpInTwoOrMore.gid
AND organism = 'pine';
&lt;/source&gt;

We can alternatively do these steps all in one single query:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM Genes, Expression as E1, Expression as E2
WHERE Genes.gid = E1.gid
AND E1.gid = E2.gid
AND E1.level &gt;= 0.5
AND E2.level &gt;= 0.5
AND E1.significance &gt;= 1.0
AND E2.significance &gt;= 1.0
AND E1.experimentid &lt;&gt; E2.experimentid
AND organism = 'pine';
&lt;/source&gt;

== Subquery Answer ==

As another approach, we can make use of subqueries to find the answer. The key to this is to make a '''correlated subquery''' where the subquery depends on some property (in this case the gene ID) of the parent query. Note that we'll still need to make use of the &lt;tt&gt;Upregulated&lt;/tt&gt; view created above to reduce code redundancy.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM Genes, Upregulated as U1
WHERE Genes.gid = U1.gid
AND organism = 'pine'
AND U1.gid = (
    SELECT DISTINCT U1.gid
    FROM Upregulated as U2
    WHERE U1.gid = U2.gid
    AND U1.experimentid &lt;&gt; U2.experimentid
);
&lt;/source&gt;

== GROUP BY Answer ==

We can make use of advanced features for certain database systems such as PostgreSQL and MySQL to make these queries in slightly more convenient ways via the &lt;tt&gt;GROUP BY&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;COUNT&lt;/tt&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE VIEW UpInTwoOrMore AS
SELECT gid
FROM Expression
WHERE level &gt;= 0.5
AND significance &gt;= 1.0
GROUP BY gid
HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 1;

SELECT name
FROM Genes, UpInTwoOrMore
WHERE Genes.gid = UpInTwoOrMore.gid
AND organism = 'pine';
&lt;/source&gt;

= Question 6 =

Find the names of pine genes that were up-regulated 0.5-fold or more (with a significance of 1.0 or more) in at least three experiments.

== Straightforward Answer ==

Similar to the answer for question 5. The caveat here is that while the equality evaluations are transitive, while inequality evaluations are not, and so every case must be covered.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE VIEW UpInThreeOrMore AS
SELECT DISTINCT U1.gid AS gid
FROM Upregulated AS U1, Upregulated AS U2, Upregulated as U3
WHERE U1.gid = U2.gid
AND U1.gid = U3.gid
AND U1.experimentid &lt;&gt; U2.experimentid
AND U1.experimentid &lt;&gt; U3.experimentid
AND U2.experimentid &lt;&gt; U3.experimentid;

SELECT name
FROM Genes, UpInThreeOrMore
WHERE Genes.gid = UpInThreeOrMore.gid
AND organism = 'pine';
&lt;/source&gt;

Alternatively:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM Genes, Expression as E1, Expression as E2, Expression as E3
WHERE Genes.gid = E1.gid
AND E1.gid = E2.gid
AND E1.gid = E3.gid
AND E1.level &gt;= 0.5
AND E2.level &gt;= 0.5
AND E3.level &gt;= 0.5
AND E1.significance &gt;= 1.0
AND E2.significance &gt;= 1.0
AND E3.significance &gt;= 1.0
AND E1.experimentid &lt;&gt; E2.experimentid
AND E1.experimentid &lt;&gt; E3.experimentid
AND E2.experimentid &lt;&gt; E3.experimentid
AND organism = 'pine';
&lt;/source&gt;

== Subquery Answer ==

We need to build in another correlated subquery for our original correlated subquery to make this work.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM Genes, Upregulated AS U1
WHERE Genes.gid = U1.gid
AND organism = 'pine'
AND U1.gid = (
    SELECT DISTINCT U1.gid
    FROM Upregulated AS U2
    WHERE U1.gid = U2.gid
    AND U1.gid = (
        SELECT DISTINCT U1.gid
        FROM Upregulated AS U3
        WHERE U1.gid = U2.gid
        AND U1.gid = U3.gid
        AND U1.experimentid &lt;&gt; U2.experimentid
        AND U1.experimentid &lt;&gt; U3.experimentid
        AND U2.experimentid &lt;&gt; U3.experimentid
    )
);
&lt;/source&gt;

== GROUP BY Answer ==

Simply adjust the count evaluation.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE VIEW UpInThreeOrMore AS
SELECT gid
FROM Expression
WHERE level &gt;= 0.5
AND significance &gt;= 1.0
GROUP BY gid
HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 2;

SELECT name
FROM Genes, UpInThreeOrMore
WHERE Genes.gid = UpInThreeOrMore.gid
AND organism = 'pine';
&lt;/source&gt;

= Question 7 =

Find the names of pine genes that were up-regulated 0.5-fold or more (with a significance of 1.0 or more) in at exactly two experiments.

== Straightforward Answer ==

The key here is identifying that taking the set of genes upregulated in two or more experiments and subtracting the set of genes upregulated in three or mor experiments gives the set of genes upregulated in precisely two experiments. Thus, our answer is the answer to question 5 subtracted by the answer to question 6.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE VIEW UpInTwo AS
SELECT *
FROM UpInTwoOrMore
EXCEPT
SELECT *
FROM UpInThreeOrMore;

SELECT name
FROM Genes, UpInTwo
WHERE Genes.gid = UpInTwo.gid
AND organism = 'pine';
&lt;/source&gt;

Or alternatively:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM Genes, Expression as E1, Expression as E2
WHERE Genes.gid = E1.gid
AND E1.gid = E2.gid
AND E1.level &gt;= 0.5
AND E2.level &gt;= 0.5
AND E1.significance &gt;= 1.0
AND E2.significance &gt;= 1.0
AND E1.experimentid &lt;&gt; E2.experimentid
AND organism = 'pine'
EXCEPT
SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM Genes, Expression as E1, Expression as E2, Expression as E3
WHERE Genes.gid = E1.gid
AND E1.gid = E2.gid
AND E1.gid = E3.gid
AND E1.level &gt;= 0.5
AND E2.level &gt;= 0.5
AND E3.level &gt;= 0.5
AND E1.significance &gt;= 1.0
AND E2.significance &gt;= 1.0
AND E3.significance &gt;= 1.0
AND E1.experimentid &lt;&gt; E2.experimentid
AND E1.experimentid &lt;&gt; E3.experimentid
AND E2.experimentid &lt;&gt; E3.experimentid
AND organism = 'pine';
&lt;/source&gt;

== Subquery Answer ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM Genes, Upregulated as U1
WHERE Genes.gid = U1.gid
AND organism = 'pine'
AND U1.gid = (
    SELECT DISTINCT U1.gid
    FROM Upregulated as U2
    WHERE U1.gid = U2.gid
    AND U1.experimentid &lt;&gt; U2.experimentid
)
EXCEPT
SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM Genes, Upregulated AS U1
WHERE Genes.gid = U1.gid
AND organism = 'pine'
AND U1.gid = (
    SELECT DISTINCT U1.gid
    FROM Upregulated AS U2
    WHERE U1.gid = U2.gid
    AND U1.gid = (
        SELECT DISTINCT U1.gid
        FROM Upregulated AS U3
        WHERE U1.gid = U2.gid
        AND U1.gid = U3.gid
        AND U1.experimentid &lt;&gt; U2.experimentid
        AND U1.experimentid &lt;&gt; U3.experimentid
        AND U2.experimentid &lt;&gt; U3.experimentid
    )
);
&lt;/source&gt;

== GROUP BY Answer ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE VIEW UpInTwo AS
SELECT *
FROM UpInTwoOrMore
EXCEPT
SELECT *
FROM UpInThreeOrMore;

SELECT name
FROM Genes, UpInTwo
WHERE Genes.gid = UpInTwo.gid
AND organism = 'pine';
&lt;/source&gt;

= Question 8 =

Find the genes that showed positive expression in every experiment recorded for it.

  SELECT Expression.gid, level from Expression WHERE level&gt;1.0;

= Question 9 =

What is the name of the gene that was most positively expressed in experiment exp23? Assume a minimum significance of 1.0.

= Question 10 =

This question builds on question 8; what is the name of the gene that was &quot;second most positively expressed&quot;? Assume again a minimum significance of 1.0.

= Question 11 =

Which gene(s) were positively expressed in ALL the experiments listed in the Experiments table? No constraints on significance level.

= Question 12 =

Prepare a table of genes, their annotation, and any experiment in which they were either the highest or lowest expressed (of any significance level). Include a fourth column to say if they were the highest or lowest.

== !STL ==
Thanks for contributing to the C++ Programming book, in regards with [[C++ Programming/Operators/Pointers/Smart Pointers|Smart Pointers]] I have moved it out of the specific STL page into it's own. I saw the post from James and agree with it, Smart Pointers came after and are not part of the STL, a quick check pointed me to October 2001 as the date that smart pointers were first considered for adoption into the standard.&lt;br&gt;
[[User:James Dennett ]]'s post at [[Talk:C++ Programming/STL]] before I addressed the issue.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:40, 16 October 2008 (UTC)</text>

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

== I've turned the speedy into a VFD ==
I've noticed that you have placed some comments on the VFD page but didn't categories them as a simple comment or with a vote direction you can and probably should correct that, the options are available at the top of the vfd page in the popup box &quot;Icon usage&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Old Dominion University Art Department Origins'''

This book has the purpose of recording the history of the Old Dominion University Art Program.
This is an ODU Art Education student research project. ODU Art Education students are working with Richard Nickel, the Art Education Program Director, to identify and interview all current and previous faculty to discover the true origins of the ODU Art program. Students are now posting current faculty and working backwards to research and create biographies of each previous faculty in each program. As the new biographies are researched and written, they will be added to the WIKI book. 

Any current or former faculty and students may contribute to this growing wiki book.

:Hi Richard,
:[[History of the ODU Art Department]] seems to be shaping up nicely.  It looks like you have moved all the pages and fixed all the links.  Would you mind if I deleted the orphaned redirects (that is, the old copies) now that they have been properly located?  I would leave [[Oduart]] alone for a little while though, since it may have been bookmarked by your students.  The ones I propose deleting are the ones that were listed on the [[WB:VfD|Vote for Deletion]] page:
:* [[Photography at ODU]]
:* [[Art History at ODU]]
:* [[Ceramics]]
:* [[Painting]]
:* [[Printmaking]]

‎No hurry on these though.  Lemme know what you think. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 01:59, 31 October 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Types of Goods ==

There are four types of goods that are determined by their technical characteristics concerning excludability and rivalry:

{| {{table}}
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|''''''
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|''''''
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|'''Excludability'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|''''''
|-
| ||||Yes||No
|-
| Rivalry||Yes||Private||“Congesting”
|-
| ||No||Club||Public
|-
| ||||||
|}

Public goods are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, 

Private goods are both excludable and rivalrous.  

Club goods (for instance a country club membership) are excludable, but non-rivalrous (in the absence of crowding).  

Congesting goods are rivalrous but not excludable, for instance a crowded street. While an individual cannot be excluded from a city street that person’s presence may cost you extra time and his occupation of space does prevent you from occupying the same space at a given time. (Note that limited access highways are potentially excludable, unlike city streets.)


=== Excludability ===
Excludability implies that the good’s provider can prevent a user from obtaining it without charge

National defense for instance is non-excludable, America’s nuclear weapons protect anyone in the country, whether or not they want it.  On the other hand the sale of anything in a store is excludable – the owner can prevent a customer from obtaining a good unless the customer pays (assuming enforceable property rights etc.).

=== Rivalry ===
Rivalry implies that one person’s consumption of a particular good prevents another individual from consuming it. 

National defense again is non-rivalrous – one person’s protection does not prevent another’s protection.  Shoes are rivalrous, only one person can wear a pair at a time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Important|Please save your work periodically.}}

{{Warning|This is the most complex section of this wikibook.}}

==Creating the Scene==
*Open ''css-lr300-idle.exp''.
*Go to File&gt;Save As. Save it as ''css-lr300-reload.exp''.
*Match the scene's FPS with the QC's reload fps. (You should already know how to do this from the idle animation page.) The fps for the sg552 reload animation is 37.
*Match the scene's end frame with the SMD's end frame minus one. (103 - 1 = 102). The end frame is 102 for the sg552 reload animation.
*Find the null ''Frame''. Below the ''Parent'' button, there is a ''CnsComp'' button. Press it.
*Click the word ''Constrain'' above the ''Parent'' button, and click ''Pose''.
*Click the left hand null. Now whenever you rotate or move the hand, the gun will follow it.
*Now constrain the right arm to the left hand.
*A popup will appear. Click the green square next to the word ''Active''.

==Constraints==
You will be using more constraints in the reload animation. First think about what should be constrained. If you give up, take a look:
*Magazine constrained to support hand, while pulling the magazine in and out.
*Bolt constrained to support hand, while pulling the bolt.
*In a more general sense, constraints could be used when a hand interacts with an object.

==Setting Up Constraints==
Because these constraints will be deactivated and activated at certain times in the animation, it not feasible to leave a null without a constraint. To resolve this we will add a new null that matches the place of the original null and constrain the original null to the new null.
*Add the following nulls in the following hierarchy:
**''constraints''
***''arm_constraint''
***''magazine_constraint''
***''bolt_constraint''
*Make ValveBiped.ValveBiped the parent of ''constraints''.
{{NOTE|Press 9 to bring out the schematic view. You will need it.}}
*Select ''arm_constraint''. On the right hand panel click ''Transform'', and click ''Match All Transforms''.
*Click the supporting arm's null.
*Repeat for the magazine and bolt constraints.
*Click ''constraints'' and its children. On the right hand panel click ''Transform'', and click ''Set Neutral Pose''.
*Take some time to think. Use the analogy of couples to rationalize the constraint process. The nulls must always have a couple for these constraints to function properly.
**Right_Arm is going out with Left_Hand. It will break this bond as it leaves the gun and becomes constrained to arm_constraint. Eventually it will meet the magazine and become a couple with the magazine.
**Magazine is not going out yet. magazine_constraint will go out with it. Constrain magazine_constraint to Magazine.
**Bolt is not going out yet. bolt_constraint will go out with it. Constrain bolt_constraint to magazine.
{{Important|A popup will appear after setting a constraint. Click the green square next to the word ''Active''. This sets a key for the constraint's status.}}
*Make sure the constraints are working by rotating the trigger hand around and seeing if it makes a smooth movement.

==Animation Layers==
*Select all nulls.
*Make two animation layers -
**movement - this covers the movement that makes the animation look less robotic.
**base - this covers everything else.

==Storyboard==
*Make sure the base layer is the activate animation layer.
*Set a key for all nulls at frame 0.
*Think about the major poses in the animation. They are:
**Idle pose (already done)
**Holding the magazine
**Magazine fully taken out (do not make this pose yet, it requires a constraint)
**Hand on bolt
**Bolt pulled by hand (do not make this pose yet, it requires a constraint)
*We can store these poses in random frames of the animation and move them using the Dopesheet Editor. Later we will move the positions around and fix the interpolation using the FCurve Editor.
{{NOTE|The supporting arm is constrained already. In this case you will have to set a key for the deactivation of its constraint to the trigger hand. Click the supporting hand null. On the right hand panel click the ''Selection'' button. Expand constraints and click double click Pose Cns. Uncheck its activity and press the green square to set a key. Now constrain the supporting arm to arm_constraint.}}

== [[Clojure_Programming/Examples/Lazy_Fibonacci|Lazy Fibonacci]] ==
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number Fibonacci numbers] are a classic example of an [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RecursiveSequence.html infinite recursive sequence].  Clojure's Lazy functions are an excellent way to implement this mathematical construct.  You can see a detailed example [[Clojure_Programming/Examples/Lazy_Fibonacci|here]].

== [[Clojure_Programming/Examples/Talking_to_Excel|Talking to Excel]] ==

Interfacing to other programs via [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model COM] can be easily done in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language) Java] using the [http://sf.net/projects/jacob-project JACOB] library. However coping with all the low-level interface when talking to an application is quite tedious. Especially since the interface is designed for C not for Java, not to mention Clojure. So we will try to improve the situation a little bit using the power of Clojure.

A detailed explanation is [[Clojure_Programming/Examples/Talking_to_Excel|here]].

== [[Clojure_Programming/Examples/Creating_an_Applet|Creating an Applet]] ==

[[Clojure_Programming/Examples/Creating_an_Applet|This tutorial]] explains how to create a simple &quot;Hello World!&quot;-applet. The article also explains how you can sign your applet (if Reflection is needed).

== genclass and finalize ==

The &lt;code&gt;[http://clojure.org/api#gen-class gen-class]&lt;/code&gt;
functions provide the most general and powerful mechanism in Clojure
for defining new Java classes. If you need to implement an existing
interface you can probably use the simpler
&lt;code&gt;[http://clojure.org/api#proxy proxy]&lt;/code&gt; function
instead, but if you need to define new Java instance methods you may
need to use &lt;code&gt;[http://clojure.org/api#gen-and-load-class gen-and-load-class]&lt;/code&gt; or
&lt;code&gt;[http://clojure.org/api#gen-and-save-class gen-and-save-class]&lt;/code&gt;.

By way of a quick introduction, here is an example of a new class
named &lt;code&gt;MyClass&lt;/code&gt; in a package named &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;.  This
class has two methods: &lt;code&gt;mymethod&lt;/code&gt;, a standard Java
&lt;code&gt;finalize&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(gen-and-load-class 'foo.MyClass
   :methods [['mymethod [String] String]
             ['finalize [] Void/TYPE]])
&lt;/source&gt;

At this point the class exists and is loaded into the JVM, but isn't
useful yet as the methods do not have definitions.  Define them like
this:

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(clojure/ns foo)

(defn MyClass-mymethod [this m]
  (str &quot;Your arg was: &quot; m))

(defn MyClass-finalize [this]
  (println &quot;Finalizing &quot; this))
&lt;/source&gt;

This class can now be used like any Java class in Clojure:

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(println (.mymethod (new foo.MyClass) &quot;foo&quot;))
&lt;/source&gt;

That example creates a new instance, calls &lt;code&gt;mymethod&lt;/code&gt;, and
prints the return value.  The &lt;code&gt;finalize&lt;/code&gt; method will
probably not be called yet, but an explicit call to the garbage
collector &lt;i&gt;may&lt;/i&gt; trigger it:

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(System/gc)
&lt;/source&gt;


== Invoking Java method through method name as a String ==
See [http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/dad12217f7a8842d Google Groups original thread] for a more conversational approach.

Credit goes to Timothy Pratley, pmf, and  Michael Wood for helping figure this out.

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
user=&gt; (defn str-invoke [instance method-str &amp; args]
            (clojure.lang.Reflector/invokeInstanceMethod 
                instance 
                method-str 
                (to-array args)))
#'user/str-invoke
user=&gt; (def i &quot;sampleString&quot;)(def m &quot;substring&quot;)(def args [2,3])
#'user/i
#'user/m
#'user/args
user=&gt; (apply str-invoke i m args)                              
&quot;m&quot;
user=&gt; 
&lt;/source&gt;


== Setting a Java property through property name as a String ==
&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(defn str-set [instance field-str arg]
    (clojure.lang.Reflector/setInstanceField
        instance 
        field-str 
        arg))
&lt;/source&gt;

Many users decide to buy Question Writer after experimenting with a free trial version.  The downloaded trial version is exactly the same as the full version, but will expire after 30 days if a license isn’t purchased. When the license is purchased you can continue using the same downloaded software – assuming that the license is for the same version that you have been trialling (Standard or Professional).  You do not need a license for the Basic Version.


When you purchase Question Writer your license will be emailed to you, usually within 1 working day of your purchase.  If your license has not arrived within a reasonable period, first check your spam.  Many email servers will not recognise the email containing the license as valid mail. If you are sure that you have not received your License get in touch with Question Writer by emailing support@questionwriter.com.

The next steps that you take will depend on which version of Question Writer you are using.

If you are using Question Writer 3 please click on this link: [[Question Writer Manual/Frequently Asked Questions/Load License/QW3|Question Writer 3 License]]

==Question Writer 4 License==

When you purchase Question Writer 4 we will send you an email with your licence file attached.  You should save this in your Question Writer 4 Program Folder.  The exact steps that you follow will depend on your operating system.

'''1. Finding your Question Writer 4 Program Folder'''&lt;br&gt;
The Question Writer Folder will have a name like

&quot;C:\Program Files\Question Writer 4&quot;

or

&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Question Writer 4&quot;

You can find it by opening Windows Explorer or “Documents” and looking on your C drive for &quot;Program Files&quot;, then looking down the list for &quot;Question Writer 4&quot;.  Alternatively you can search your computer for &quot;Question Writer 4&quot;.

'''2. Download the license file from your email'''&lt;br&gt;
You will not be able to open this file – you need to save it instead.  

Depending on your Operating System you may be given a choice to '''Open or Save''' in which case choose '''Save''' and save the license file to your Question Writer 4 Program Folder.  

The file my be downloaded automatically to your default location – your Downloads Folder.  Again you cannot '''Open''' the file but can choose to '''Show in Folder'''. From there you can drag and drop it to your Question Writer 4 Program Folder.

'''3. Check that the license file is in the Program Folder'''&lt;br&gt;
You should then be able to see the license file in the Question Writer 4 Program Folder – it will have your name (or the name in which you bought your license) as part of the file name.  The full file name is: 

“Your Name – Organization Name – Question Writer 4 – Version.license”

The version will be eg Professional Academic or Standard Commercial depending on the version purchased


[[File:QW4 Program file.jpg|center]]


'''4. Select your Version'''&lt;br&gt;
When you first open Question Writer, before you open any quizzes, you will see on the menu bar the options '''File''', '''Import''', '''Language''', '''Version''' and '''Help'''.


[[File:QW Version.jpg|center]]


Click on version and select the version for which you are licensed.  Question Writer will then close. You should then restart it.  This time it will recognise your license and open the version that you have purchased.  

If you are still given the message about a the number of days left in the trial then it is most likely that either the license file is not in the Program Folder or that you have selected the wrong version eg you have selected the Professional version but only have a standard license.


Occasionally the license file sent to you will get corrupted in the mail system and you might see an error message.  If this happens get in touch with us and we will send your license again, usually in a zipped file.  See [[../License|Why do I get an error message when I try to activate my License?]]

      <text xml:space="preserve"> '''The Invention of the Steam Engine'''
The invention of the steam engine took place in 1825. The first steam engine was the &quot;Penny Darren&quot; built at Coalbrookdale, although George Stephenson created the first recognised locomotive and named it &quot;Rocket&quot;. The development of &quot;Rocket&quot; led to the recognition of the potential of railways and to the development of further steam engines, heralding the age of railway transport.

      <text xml:space="preserve">windows programming/ read from monitor memory vs write into monitor memory

Context Switching on ''processes'' not on ''programs''. State is of ''process'', context is of ''process'', the ''process'' is not a ''program''.
I think it is necessary to give a mean of a ''process'' here on page.

== &quot;Context Switching&quot; should have more detail ==

After reading the &quot;Context Switching&quot; section, I was left with a couple questions:
# How do programs allow the operating system to run?  Do compilers automatically throw in system calls to do this?
# If the processor is in user mode running a process, how does it know the thread quantum has been exceeded, and how does it tell the kernel to run context switching?
I'll research and answer them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are a variety of types of transportation data used in analysis. Some are listed below:

* Infrastructure Status
* Traffic Counts
* Travel Behavior Inventory
* Land Use Inventory
* Truck/Freight Demand
* External/Internal Demand (by Vehicle Type)
* Special Generators

==  Revealed Preference ==


Household travel surveys which ask people what they actually did are a type of ''Revealed Preference'' survey data that have been obtained by direct observation of the choice that individuals make with respect to travel behavior. ''Travel Cost Analysis'' uses the prices of market goods to evaluate the value of goods that are not traded in the market.

''Hedonic Pricing'' uses the market price of a traded good and measures of its component attributes to calculate value. There are other methods to attain Revealed Preference information, but surveys are the most common in travel behavior.

=== Travel Behavior Inventory ===

While the Cleveland Regional Area Traffic Study in 1927 was the first metropolitan planning attempt sponsored by the US federal government, the lack of comprehensive survey methods and standards at that time precluded the systematic collection of information such as travel time, origin and destination, and traffic counts. The first US travel surveys appeared in urban areas after the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1944 permitted the spending of federal funds on urban highways &lt;ref&gt;Weiner, Edward, (1997) http://tmip.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/clearinghouse/158 Urban Transportation Planning in the United States: An Historical Overview]. U.S. Department of Transportation. Fifth Edition. &lt;/ref&gt;. A new home- interview origin-destination survey method was developed in which households were asked about the number of trips, purpose, mode choice, origin and destination of the trips conducted on a daily basis. In 1944, the US Bureau of Public Roads printed the Manual of Procedures for Home Interview Traffic Studies. &lt;ref&gt;US Department of Commerce (1944) Manual of Procedures for Home Interview Traffic Studies. US Bureau of Public Roads. Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt;. This new procedure was first implemented in several small to mid-size areas. Highway engineers and urban planners made use of the new data collected after the 1944 Highway Act extended federally sponsored planning to travel surveys as well as traffic counts, highway capacity studies, pavement condition studies and cost-benefit analysis.

Attributes of a household travel survey, or travel behavior inventory include:

* Travel Diary of ~ 1% sample of population (all trips made on one day) every 10 years
* Socioeconomic/demographic data of survey respondents
* Collection methodology: 
** Phone, 
** Mail, 
** In-Person at Home, 
** In-Person at Work, 
** Roadside

Many such surveys are available online at: [http://surveyarchive.org Metropolitan Travel Survey Archive]



=== Thought Question ===

What are the  advantages and disadvantages of Revealed Preference surveys?

== Stated Preference ==
In contrast with revealed preference, ''Stated preference'' is a group of techniques used to calculate the utility functions of transport options based on the response of an individual decision-maker to certain given options.  The options generally are based on descriptions of the transport scenario or are constructed by the researcher

* ''Contingent valuation'' is based on the assumption that the best way to find out the value that an individual places on something is known by asking.
* ''Compensating variation'' is the compensating payment that leaves an individual as well off as before the economic change.
* ''Equivalent variation'' for a benefit is the minimum amount of money one would have to be compensated to leave the person as well as they would be after the change.
* ''Conjoint analysis'' refers to the application of the design of experiments to obtain the preferences of the individual, breaking the task into a list of choices or ratings that enable us to compute the relative importance of each of the attributes studied

== Pavement conditions ==
''adapted from Xie, Feng and David Levinson (2008) The Use of Road Infrastructure Data for Urban Transportation Planning: Issues and Opportunities. Published in Infrastructure Reporting and Asset Management Edited by Adjo Amekudzi and Sue McNeil. pp- 93-98. Publisher: American Society of Civil Engineers, Reston, Virginia.''&lt;ref&gt;Xie, Feng and David Levinson (2008) The Use of Road Infrastructure Data for Urban Transportation Planning: Issues and Opportunities. Published in Infrastructure Reporting and Asset Management Edited by Adjo Amekudzi and Sue McNeil. pp- 93-98. Publisher: American Society of Civil Engineers, Reston, Virginia&lt;/ref&gt;

Road infrastructure represents the supply side of an urban transportation system. Pavement condition is a critical indicator to the quality of road infrastructure in terms of providing a smooth and reliable driving environment on roads. A series of indices have been developed to evaluate the pavement conditions of road segments in their respective jurisdictions: Pavement Condition Index (PCI) is scored as a perfect roadway (100 points) minus point deductions for “distresses” that are observed; Present Serviceability Rating (PSR) is measured as vertical movement per unit horizontal movement (e.g. millimeters of vertical displacement per meter of horizontal displacement) as one drives along the road; (SR) Surface Rating  is calculated by reviewing images of the roadway based on the frequency and severity of defects; Pavement Quality Index (PQI) is calculated using the PSR and SR to evaluate the general condition of the road. A high PQI (up to 4.5) means a road will most likely not need maintenance soon, whereas a low PQI means it can be selected for maintenance &lt;ref&gt;Hammerand, J. (2006). “Rating Minnesota’s Roads.” The Minnesota Local Technical Assistance Program (LTAP): Technology Exchange, vol.24, No.1, 3&lt;/ref&gt;.

These indices of pavement quality are basic measures for road maintenance and preservation, for which each county develops its own performance standards to evaluate pavement conditions and make decisions on maintenance and preservation projects. Typically, pavement preservation projects are prioritized based on PCI of road segments: the lower the PCI, the higher the likelihood of selection. Taking Washington County, Minnesota as an example &lt;ref&gt;Washington County Transportation Division (2004). “Washington County Annual Performance Report for 2004.” &lt;http://www.co.washington.mn.us/client_files/documents/adm/PerfMeas-2004//ADM- PM-04-Transportation.pdf&gt; (May 20, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;, the county has determined that a reasonable standard to maintain is an average PCI of 72. Thus any road segment with its PCI below 72 has a chance to be selected for preservation. Dakota County, Minnesota on the other hand, scores its preservation projects according to the measure of PQI: a road segment will be allocated 17 points (out of a possible 100) if its PQI falls lower than 3.1.

The pavement data structure is incompatible with the link-node structure of the planning road network used by the Metropolitan Council and other planning agencies. Typically, the measures of PCI, PSR, and PQI are stored in records indexed by “highway segment numbers” along each highway route. Highway sections with the same highway segment number are differentiated by their starting and ending stations. There is no exact match between highway segments in the actual road network and links in the planning network, as stationing is a position along the curved centerline of a highway while a planning network is a simplified structure consisting of only straight lines intersecting at points. Historic pavement data is generally unavailable in electronic format, although the information on pavement history such as pavement life and the duration since last repaving are important to estimate the cost of a preservation project, also affecting the decision whether a specific project will get selected and how much funding will be allocated.


== Traffic flow ==

Traffic conditions reflect the travel demand loaded on a given road infrastructure. Traffic flows on roads, together with road capacity, can be used to calculate the volume/capacity (V/C) ratio, which is an approximate indicator for the level of service of road infrastructure, and is commonly adopted by the jurisdictions in their respective decision making processes. The traffic flows on the planning road network are predicted by the transportation planning model, but the results have to be calibrated with actual traffic data.

Loop detectors are the primary technology currently employed in many US metropolitan areas to collect actual traffic data. E.g. In the Twin Cities of Minneapolis-St. Paul, about one thousand detector stations have been buried on major highways, through which Mn/DOT’s Traffic Management Center collects, stores, and makes public traffic data every 30 seconds, including measured volume (flow) and occupancy, and calculated speed data for each detector station. Although the estimates of Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) for the planning road network are readily available, loop detectors provide more accurate measures of traffic volume, since they are collecting real-time data on a continuous basis. It also allows for calibrating models to hourly rather than daily conditions.

Due to the limited ability to convert raw data collected by loop detectors, however, most forecasting models rely on AADT data. The raw data are stored in a 30- second interval in binary codes. For planning uses they have to be converted and aggregated into desired measures, such as peak hour average, average for a particular month or a particular season, etc, in a systematic way. 

Another issue in integrating loop detector data into a planning road network is to match the detector stations with the links in planning networks. Similar to the problem encountered in translating pavement data, detectors are located along major highways and mapped on the actual geometry of the network, while the planning road network is a simplified structure with only straight lines.

''Adapted from Levinson, D. and Zofka, Ewa. (2006) [http://nexus.umn.edu/Papers/SurveyArchive.pdf “The Metropolitan Travel Survey Archive: A Case Study in Archiving”] in ''Travel Survey Methods: Quality and Future Directions, Proceedings of 5th International Conference on Travel Survey Methods'' (Peter Stopher and Cheryl Stecher, editors)''&lt;ref&gt; Levinson, D. and Zofka, Ewa. (2006) [http://nexus.umn.edu/Papers/SurveyArchive.pdf “The Metropolitan Travel Survey Archive: A Case Study in Archiving”] in ''Travel Survey Methods: Quality and Future Directions, Proceedings of 5th International Conference on Travel Survey Methods'' (Peter Stopher and Cheryl Stecher, editors)&lt;/ref&gt;

Metadata allows data to function together. Simply put, metadata is information about information – labeling, cataloging and descriptive information structured to permit data to be processed. Ryssevik and Musgrave (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Ryssevik J, Musgrave S. (1999) The Social Science Dream Machine: Resource discovery, analysis and delivery on the Web. Paper given at the IASSIST Conference. Toronto, May. &lt;/ref&gt; argue that high quality metadata standards are essential as metadata is the launch pad for any resource discovery, maps complex data, bridges the gap between data producers and consumers, and links data with its resultant reports and scientific studies produced about it. To meet the increasing needs for the proper data formats and encoding standards, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has developed the generic Resource Description Framework (RDF) (W3C 2002). RDF treats metadata more generally, providing a standard way to use Extended Markup Language (XML) to “represent metadata in the form of statements about properties and relationships of items”
(W3C 2002) &lt;ref&gt;World Wide Web Consortium (2002) Metadata Activity Statement&lt;/ref&gt;. Resources can be almost any type of file, including of course, travel surveys. RDF delivers detailed and unified data description vocabulary.

Applying these tools specifically to databases, the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) for Document Type Definitions (DTD) applies metadata standards used for documenting datasets. DDI was first developed by European and North American data archives, libraries and official statistics agencies. “The Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) is an effort to establish an international XML-based standard for the content, presentation, transport, and preservation of documentation for datasets in the social and behavioral sciences” (Data Documentation Initiative 2004). As this international standardization effort gathers momentum it is expected more and more datasets to be documented using DDI as the primary metadata format. With DDI, searching data archives on the Internet no longer depends on an archivist's skill at capturing the information that is important to researchers. The standard of data description provides sufficient detail sorted in a user-friendly manner.

=== Discussion ===

What does this all mean?

System Rational vs. User Rational

Tit for Tat vs. Myopic Selfishness

See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatol_Rapoport#Game_theory Anatol Rapoport], who developed the successful Tit-for-Tat strategy for a similar, computer based strategy.

== Game Theory ==

Game theory is concerned with general analysis of strategic interaction of economic agents whose decisions affect each other. 

Problems that can be analyzed with Game Theory:

* Congestion
* Financing
* Merging
* Bus vs. Car
*  … 

who are the agents in each game?

=== Strategies ===

In game theory, ''dominance'' (also called strategic dominance) occurs when one strategy is better than another strategy for one player, no matter how that player's opponents may play. Many simple games can be solved using dominance. The opposite, intransitivity, occurs in games where one strategy may be better or worse than another strategy for one player, depending on how the player's opponents may play. (ref: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant_strategy Dominant strategy])

''Nash Equilibrium'' (NE): a pair of strategies is defined as a NE if A's choice is optimal given B's and B's choice is optimal given A's choice.  A NE can be interpreted as a pair of expectations about each person's choice such that once one person makes their choice neither individual wants to change their behavior. 

If a strictly dominant strategy exists for one player in a game, that player will play that strategy in each of the game's Nash equilibria. If both players have a strictly dominant strategy, the game has only one unique Nash equilibrium. However, that Nash equilibrium is not necessarily Pareto optimal, meaning that there may be non-equilibrium outcomes of the game that would be better for both players. The classic game used to illustrate this is the Prisoner's Dilemma.  (ref: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant_strategy Dominant strategy])

{| {{table}}
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|''''''
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|''''''
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|'''Player B'''

|-
| ||||i||j
|-
| Player A||i||[3,3]*||[2,2]
|-
| ||j||[2,2]||[1,1]
|}

Payoffs for player A are represented is the first number in a cell, the payoffs for player B are given as the second number in that cell.  Thus strategy pair [i,i] implies a payoff of 3 for player A and also a payoff of 3 for player B.  The NE is asterisked in the above illustrations. This represents a situation in which each firm or person is making an optimal choice given the other firm or persons choice.  Here both A and B clearly prefer choice i to choice j.  Thus [i,i] is a NE.

=== Prisoner's Dilemma ===

Earlier, we played both a finite one-time game and an indefinitely  repeated game.  The game was formulated as what is referred to as a ‘prisoner’s dilemma’.  

The term prisoner’s dilemma comes from the situation where two partners in crime are both arrested and interviewed separately. If they both ‘hang tough’, they get light sentences for lack of evidence (say 1 year each).  If they both crumble in interrogation and confess, they both split the time for the crime (say 10 years).   But if one confesses and the other doesn’t, the one who confesses turns state’s evidence (and gets parole) and helps convict the other (who does 20 years time in prison) 

In the one-time or finitely repeated Prisoners' Dilemma game, to confess (toll, defect, evens) is a dominant strategy, and when both prisoners confess (states toll, defect, evens), that is a dominant strategy equilibrium.


== Applications of Game Theory to Transportation ==
=== Tolling at a Frontier ===
' (based on Levinson, David (1999)  [http://nexus.umn.edu/Papers/Frontier.pdf Tolling at a Frontier: A Game Theoretic Analysis]. Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Transportation and Traffic Theory 173-187.)''

Two states (Delaware and New Jersey) are separated by a body of water.  They are connected by a bridge over that body.  How should they finance that bridge and the rest of their roads?

Should they toll or tax?

Let &lt;math&gt;r_{I}&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;r_{J}&lt;/math&gt; be tolls of the two jurisdictions.  Demand is a negative exponential function.  
(Objective is to maximize local welfare (utility of residents plus toll revenue from non-residents (toll revenue from residents is considered a transfer)).

{| {{table}}
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|''''''
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|''''''
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|'''Jurisdiction J (New Jersey)'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|''''''
|-
| ||||i||j
|-
| Jurisdiction I (Delaware) ||i||[1153, 1153]*||[2322,883]
|-
| ||j||[883, 2322]||[1777,1777]
|}

The table is read like this: Each jurisdiction chooses one of the two strategies (Toll or Tax). In effect, Jurisdiction 1 (Delaware) chooses a row and jurisdiction 2 (New Jersey) chooses a column. The two numbers in each cell tell the outcomes for the two states when the corresponding pair of strategies is chosen. The number to the left of the comma tells the payoff to the jurisdiction who chooses the rows (Delaware) while the number to the right of the column tells the payoff to the state who chooses the columns (New Jersey). Thus (reading down the first column) if they both toll, each gets $1153/hour in welfare , but if New Jersey Tolls and Delaware Taxes, New Jersey gets $2322 and Delaware only $883. 

So: how to solve this game? What strategies are &quot;rational&quot; if both states want to maximize welfare? New Jersey might reason as follows: &quot;Two things can happen: Delaware can toll or Delaware can keep tax. Suppose Delaware tolls. Then I get only $883 if I don't toll, $1153 if I do, so in that case it's best to toll. On the other hand, if Delaware taxes  and I toll, I get $2322, and if I tax we both get $1777. Either way, it's best if I toll. Therefore, I'll toll.&quot;

But Delaware reasons similarly.  Thus they both toll, and lost $624/hour. Yet, if they had acted &quot;irrationally,&quot; and taxed, they each could have gotten $1777/hour.

=== Coordination Game ===

In Britain, Japan, Australia, and some other island nations people drive on the left side of the road; in the US and the European continent they drive on the right.  But everywhere, everyone drives on the same side as everywhere else, even if that side changes from place to place.  

How is this arrangement achieved?

There are two strategies: drive on the left side and drive on the right side. There are two possible outcomes: the two cars pass one another without incident or they crash. We arbitrarily assign a value of one each to passing without problems and of -10 each to a crash. Here is the payoff table:

{| {{table}}
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|''''''
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|''''''
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|'''Mercedes'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|''''''
|-
| ||||Left||Right
|-
| Buick||Left||[1,1]||[-10,-10]
|-
| ||Right||[-10,-10]||[1,1]
|}

(Objective: Maximize payoff) 

Verify that LL and RR are both Nash equilibria. 

But, if we do not know which side to choose, there is some danger that we will choose LR or RL at random and crash. How can we know which side to choose? The answer is, of course, that for this coordination game we rely on social convention. Conversely, we know that in this game, social convention is very powerful and persistent, and no less so in the country where the solution is LL than in the country where it is RR.

== Issues in Game Theory ==

* What is “rationality” ?
* What happens when the rational strategy depends on strategies of others?
* What happens if information is incomplete?
* What happens if there is uncertainty or risk?
* Under what circumstances is cooperation better than selfishness?  Under what circumstances is cooperation selfish?
* How do continuing interactions differ from one-time events?
* Can morality be derived from rational selfishness?
* How does reality compare with game theory?

== Thought Question ==

How does an infinitely or indefinitely repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma game differ from a finitely repeated or one-time  game?
Why?

== Problem ==

&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
Two airlines (United, American) each offer 1 flight from New York to Los Angeles. 

Price = $/pax, Payoff = $/flight.  

Each plane carries 500 passengers.  

Fixed cost is $50000 per flight, total demand at $200 is 500 passengers. 

At $400, total demand is 250 passengers.

Passengers choose cheapest flight. 

Payoff = Revenue - Cost

Work in pairs (4 minutes): 

1. Formulate the Payoff Matrix for the Game.

2. What is equilibrium ?
&lt;/div&gt;
=== Solution ===
&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #02D4EE; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;

[[Transportation Economics/Agents/Solution1|Solution]]

&lt;/div&gt;

== Zero-Sum ==
''Zero-Sum game'': If we add up the wins and losses in a game, treating losses as negatives, and we find that the sum is zero for each set of strategies chosen, then the game is a “zero-sum game.&quot;

== Problem Extension ==
&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
3. What happens if there is a third price $300, for which demand is 375 passengers.

Reformulate the problem. 
&lt;/div&gt;
=== Solution ===

&lt;/div&gt;

== Mixed Strategies ==

''Mixed strategy'': If a player in a game chooses among two or more strategies at random according to specific probabilities, this choice is called a &quot;mixed strategy.&quot;

Equilibrium is [$200,$200]

SOLUTION: Maximin criterion 

For a two-person, zero sum game it is rational for each player to choose the strategy that maximizes the minimum payoff, and the pair of strategies and payoffs such that each player maximizes her minimum payoff is the “solution to the game.&quot;

While incorporating theory, there is a very applied bent to the course, as all the ideas covered are intended to help inform the real decisions that are made (or should be made) in practice.

This book uses two core ideas:

#Individuals (firms, agencies, agents, actors) behave according to incentives provided by their environment.
#The environment is shaped by the collective behavior of individuals.

The material of each page can be covered in a ninety-minute lecture.

Natural uranium consists of three isotopes. These are uranium234, uranium235 and Uranium238.
Hereby is uranium234 a decay product of uranium238, whose concentration is in a
fix relation to uranium238. The concentration of uranium235 is independent of the content of 
uranium238.
As uranium238 and uranium235 decay with different speed, the isotope composition of natural uranium changes by time.

This has drastical consequences: 

2 billion years ago in Oklo in today's Gabun, there was a natural reactor moderated by normal water. At
those days natural uranium consisted of 3% uranium 235, this is the same concentration as in nuclear fuel for
boiling water reactors in power plants.

Today natural uranium has only a uranium 235 concentration of 0.72 %. A chain reaction in normal water is impossible. Usage of heavy water or enrichment of uranium 235 is required.

Should there exist in a few billion years, before the sun gets a red giant, intelligent life in our solar system, it will have great problems
to exploit nuclear fission, as concentration of uranium235 will be very low.

The development of isotope composition can be calculated as described below:

Lot of uranium235 in dependence of time t

&lt;math&gt;p(Uranium235)*0.5^\frac{t}{HalfLifeTimeU235}&lt;/math&gt;

Lot of uranium238 in dependence of time t

&lt;math&gt;p(Uranium238)*0.5^\frac{t}{HalfLifeTimeU238}&lt;/math&gt;

Lot of uranium234 in dependence of time t

&lt;math&gt;p(Uranium238)*\frac{HalfLifeTimeU234}{HalfLifeTimeU238}*(0.5^\frac{t}{HalfLifeTimeU238})&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Pricing'''
 
== Rationales for Pricing ==

Roadway congestion, air pollution from cars, and the lack of resources to finance new surface transportation options present challenges.  Road pricing, charging users a monetary toll in addition to the amount of time spent traveling, has been suggested as a solution to these problems.  While tolls are common for certain expensive facilities such as tunnels and bridges, they are less common on streets and highways.  A  new generation of private toll roads are being deployed in the United States and elsewhere.  There have been a few trials of areawide pricing schemes, such as in Singapore, London, and Stockholm, and many others proposed but not implemented.  

In short pricing can accomplish several objectives

* [[Transportation Economics/Revenue|Revenue]]
* Congestion management - Traffic congestion is very common in large cities and on major highways. It is time consuming and imposes a significant amount of uncertainty and aggravation on passengers and freight transportation. Most of the cost of traffic congestion caused by travelers' selfish behaviors (see discussion of [[Fundamentals of  Transportation/Route Choice|Route Choice]]), because they impose delays on others and do not pay the full marginal cost of their trips. In economic terms, a negative externality is created. In order to solve this problem some economist proposed that there should be a tax on congestion.  In the first edition of his textbook, ''The Economics of Welfare'', Pigou (1920) argued for a tax on congestion and thereby launched the literature on congestion pricing. Most economists support congestion pricing as a good way to relieve the dilemma, while many have been concerned about the details of implementation. Congestion charges allocate scarce road capacity in congested areas and peak times. Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) and Automated Vehicle Identification (AVI) technologies allow this to be done without delaying travelers.
* Pavement management - Pavement damage depends on vehicle weight per axle, not total vehicle weight - the damage power rises exponentially to the third power with the load per axle (e.g., a rear axle of a typical 13-ton van causes over 1000 times as much damages that of a car).  In order to reflect the pavement damage costs more accurately, Small and Winston (1989) propose a &quot;graduated per-mile tax based on axle weight&quot;.  This would give truckers (truck manufactuers) an incentive to reduce axle weights by shifting to trucks with more axles, extending pavement life and reducing highway maintenance.  The fuel tax currently in place provides truckers with the opposite incentives: the tax rises with a vehicle's axles, since trucks with more axles require larger engines and get lower fuel economy. They pointed out that the pavement thickness guidelines of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) fails to incorporate economic optimization into the design procedure.  For example, by increasing rigid concrete pavement thickness only by 2.6 inches from currently 11.2 inches to 13.8 inches would more than double the life of the pavement.
* Off-loading costs or reallocating costs (changing who bears burden) - Highway cost allocation studies periodically attempt to update the amount of burden for roads borne by cars and various classes of trucks, but they only have two policy tools (gasoline and diesel fuel taxes) to do the job. A more robust pricing strategy could make charges far more directly proportional to source.
* Changing energy supply indicates declining gas tax revenue
* Encourage alternatives to driving

There are reasons that road pricing is not more widespread.  Until recently, technical issues were dominant, toll collection added considerable delay and greatly reduced net revenue with the need for humans sitting in toll booths.   However, advances in automatic vehicle identification and tolling have enabled toll collection, without human operators, at full speed.    Other issues are fundamentally political: concerns over privacy, equity, and the perception of double taxation.  Privacy concerns, though political, may have a technical solution, with the use of electronic money, which is not identified with its owner, rather than credit or debit cards or automatic identification and billing of vehicles.   Equity issues, the belief that there will be winners and losers from the new system, may not be entirely resolvable.  Though it can be shown that under certain circumstances road pricing has a net benefit for society as a whole, unless a mechanism exists for making a sufficient majority of road users and voters benefit, or perceive benefit,  this concern is a roadblock to implementation.  Similarly, people may believe that they have paid for roads already through gas taxes and general revenue, and that charging for them is akin to double taxation.  Unless users can be convinced that the revenue raised is for maintenance and expansion, or another  convincing public purpose, the political sell will be difficult.  Widespread road pricing may require changes in the general transportation financing structure and a clear accounting of the benefits will need to be provided.

== Theory of Congestion Pricing ==
[[Image:TE-Pricing-EquilibriumCongestion.png |right|thumb|400px||Caption: Congestion Pricing Brings About Efficient Equilibrium.]]

Whenever a scarce and valued good such as road use is free or under priced, demand will outstrip supply.  An illustration pertaining to road use is evident by the queues and traffic jams that occur when the number of motorists attempting to use a section of roadway at the same time exceeds the road’s capacity.  Expanding capacity to meet peak demand results in wasteful excess capacity during non-peak periods unless the peak users are charged the full cost of the expansion.  If we look at long-distance telephone service, allocation is determined with a market mechanism by charging a premium for a call during peak periods and by offering a discount during off peak periods.  Consumers appear to accept a market-based system for allocating demand in long-distance telephone service and the system suggests this policy works.

In the case of roads, demand is allocated by congestion.  The excess demand for road use during peak periods causes congestion.  Economists believe that travel behavior is directed by the out-of-pocket expense of a trip plus the value of time that is required.  Some motorists do shift their time of travel when congestion gets bad enough, but not enough motorists shift to entirely alleviate the congestion.  The number of motorists that do shift their time of travel will never be sufficient to reduce congestion because -without some sort of pricing or rationing of road use- motorists using the road during peak periods do not have to pay for the delays they cause each other.

Making motorists pay for the delays they caused others by making their trips rather than just their personal costs would lead some to make other choices.  Motorists may decide to change their time of travel, carpool, or use public transportation.  Congestion pricing would allow motorists to make peak-period trips under less congested conditions, but only if they are willing to pay for the delays they impose on each other.  The price would be set at a level that reduces congestion to its most efficient level, which can be shown to be the full monetary and time cost for using a segment of road capacity during the peak period.

Decisions made by road users about where and when to use their vehicles are made by comparing the benefits they will receive from using the road with the costs to themselves.  These costs do not include the costs they impose on other travelers or on society as a whole, such as congestion and environmental damage.  The results from this type of behavior are trips being made in which benefits to the motorist are less than the costs to society.  There is more traffic than can be justified and is not efficiently located in time and capacity.  If people are charged for the costs they impose on others because of their travel decisions, then that pattern of travel which results in optimal efficiently will occur.

==Alternative Revenue Mechanisms ==
Road user charging may be more or less direct.  Generally, indirect methods of road charges are related to vehicle ownership and usage.  Examples would be fixed charges for owning a car -purchase tax for buying a new vehicle and annual licensing renewals- and variable charges on car usage -taxes on tires oil and fuel.

Indirect methods of road charging, such as fuel taxes, are the most commonly used in today’s society because of the high volume of usage and ease of collection.  However, revenue methods like fuel taxes rarely channel funds directly into a road or transportation fund that is specifically for highway maintenance or development.  Where there is congestion caused by multiple road users, drivers impose a marginal social cost in terms of delay and higher operating costs on other uses, for which they are not being charged.

Direct charging involves monitoring the actual time or distance of vehicle travel and charging appropriately.  There are many ways in which to carry out direct charging.  With the development of electronic technology, both off-vehicle and now in-vehicle charging mechanisms can be implemented.  Off-vehicle mechanisms are devices like manual toll collection booths, coin operated machines, and road side auto-scanners.  In-vehicle mechanisms are magnetic cards, smart cards, and transponders.

Congestion pricing could take several forms.  The most straightforward example would be to add an extra fee to an existing toll, or to add a peak fee on an untolled route or bridge.  The charge could be a simple peak premium price or off-peak discount received, or the charge could vary according to the demand imposed on a facility at a specific time.  

In practice, congestion pricing could take six forms:
*	Point pricing, In which a highway user passing a point at a  specific time is charged a fee for passing that point regardless of the distance traveled on a specified route;
*	Cordon pricing, in which users wishing to enter a congested area are charged fees at each entry point;
*	Zone pricing, in which users traveling within a cordoned area also pay a fee;
*	Higher charges for parking in congested areas, with particular emphasis on parking during the most congested period;
*	Congestion-specific charges, in which users would be charged for both the amount of time spent and distance traveled.

The policies have different implications for demand.  General taxes cannot be expected to reduce demand for travel in particular.  Transportation specific taxes should reduce demand to a limited extent, but will not reduce demand on targeted road links, such as congested facilities.  A cordon toll will reduce demand crossing the cordon, but by its nature is less targeted than “perfect tolls”.  While different finance mechanisms have different implications for how they affect demand, they also have different costs of collection.  It has historically been true that the more targeted the mechanism, the more costly.  However, with the advent of wider use of electronic toll collection, those historical truisms may be altered.
Varying the level of jurisdiction administering the policy changes the perception of welfare.  Local governments are responsible to local citizens - their constituents, and tend not to concern themselves with the welfare of non-local residents.  Therefore the incentive structure facing different layers of government needs to be distinguished.  The welfare resulting from implementation when roads are owned and operated by a state may differ from the welfare if the same financing mechanism were implemented by a regional metropolitan planning organization that owned and operated the roads and could retain toll revenue.  Similarly, the metropolitan planning organization differs from the county.  The key reasons for these differences relate to who pays the tolls, and whether or not the (or to what extent) toll-payers reside within the boundaries of the local governmental agency.  A county’s concern for the economic welfare of non-county residents is minimal, as is a metropolitan regions concern for residents of other areas.  Decentralization of decision making can thus influence the chosen policy.

== Effects of Congestion Pricing ==
The evidence from past changes in bridge and turnpike tolls demonstrates that motorists do respond to changes in price.  In referring to the price elasticity of individual demand for transportation, analyses suggest an elasticity of approximately -0.10 to -0.15 as a lower limit and -0.3 to -0.4 as an upper limit depending on the charge, the current costs of travel, and the capacity of alternative roads and transit systems. There will be a decline in demand following a price increase, but consumer demand for road use is strong enough that the percentage decline in demand will not be as large as the percentage increase in price.  

There are many possible changes in travel choice, including: 
*	 Route, changing from tolled to untolled routes or to faster tolled routes.
*	 Time, changing to earlier or later departures to avoid tolls or tolled periods.
*	 Mode, changing to or away from carpools, transit, or other modes.
*	 Destination, changing to a closer location for non-work activities.
*	 Location, moving home or workplace to reduce the commute.
*	 Sequence, linking trips by combining multiple errands on a single trip.  
*	 Frequency, reducing the number of less important trips 
*	 Presence, conducting activities by telecommuting to decrease work related trips.  
*	 Ownership, Motorists may also forgo ownership of automobiles to bypass toll charges.

Congestion pricing on highways would have broad effects on the entire transportation system by shifting the demand for transportation services away from peak period highway use by solo drivers.  A reduction in the incentives to drive during peak periods would shift some traffic to the off-peak, which would increase the efficiency of the road system - therefore, reduce the demand for additional capacity.  Some motorists would continue to drive during the peak but would elect to share rides with others or change the destinations of their trips.  Sharing rides with others would also increase the efficiency in which the system is used by increasing the number of people per vehicle during peak periods.

Some motorists would shift to transit.  The improvement in traffic flows that would result from congestion pricing would improve service reliability and speed, therefore, making transit more attractive than the automobile.  The increase in use of transit would increase revenues.  These revenues could be put towards increasing service frequency or route coverage.  Congestion pricing would also reduce demand for new highway development.  This would decrease the demand for capital expenditure on road development in response to growing population and travel demand.

== Unpacking ==
[[Image:TE-Pricing-EquilbriumUnpacked.png|right|thumb|400px]]

The top part of Figure 2 shows schematically the travel time to a driver (short run average cost) at a bottleneck or on a capacitated link resulting from various levels of approach flow.  The travel time function relates travel time (or delay) and approach traffic flow.  The greater the approach flow, the higher the travel time.  At flows below capacity (level of service A (SA) or B (SB)), traffic flows smoothly, while at high approach flows, those above capacity, traffic is stop and start and is classified as level of service E (SE) or F (SF).


The bottom part of Figure 2 shows schematically the implicit demand for travel on a link as a function of the travel time.  All else equal (for instance the price charged to users), demand to travel on a link at level of service A (DA) is higher than demand at level of service F (DF).   However the demand and the travel time on a link are not independent, as shown in Figure 2(A).  

So the implicit demand and revealed demand are not identical, rather the revealed demand is formed by projecting the travel time at a given flow onto the implicit demand curves.  So for instance, when the price charged users is high, the revealed demand coincides with the implicit demand at level of service A (DA). As the prices are lowered, the revealed demand crosses the implicit demand curve at level of service B (DB), then DC, DD, DE and finally at a zero money price it crosses DF.  While the actual prices that  generate specific demand levels vary from  place to place with local circumstances, demand preferences, and market conditions, the general trend (higher prices gives lower approach flow gives better level of service) is simply an application of the law of demand from economics along with traffic flow theory.

In other words, the change in welfare with congestion pricing depends not only on both the change in price and quantity, but also on the change in reservation price.  The reservation price is the amount travelers would be willing to pay at a given level of service.  And at better levels of service, travelers (and potential travelers) have a higher reservation price.

== Welfare Analysis ==

[[Image:TE-Pricing-WelfareAnalysis.png| right|thumb|400px]]

The movement along the revealed demand curve follows the shape of the curve shown above because of the relationship between traffic flow (quantity demanded) and travel time. Assume for instance that each level of service category represents a one-minute increase in travel time from the immediately better travel time.  So in the graph, let the level of service for a one minute trip be denoted SA , and for a six minute trip, SF.  The amount of traffic necessary to move from 1 minute to 2 minutes exceeds the amount to move from 2 to 3 minutes. In other words, there is a rising average (and thus marginal) cost in terms of time.

The concepts in Figure 2 can be used to develop the welfare analysis shown in Figure 3.  There are several areas of interest in Figure 3.  The first is defined by the lower left triangle (the blue + green) (triangle VOZ) which is the consumer surplus when the road is unpriced.  The second is the producer surplus (profit) to the road authority when the road is priced, illustrated by the rectangle formed in the lower left (yellow + green) (rectangle OVWY).  The third is the consumer surplus when the road is priced, shown in gray (triangle UVW).  This consumer surplus represents a higher reservation price than the other because the level of service is better when flow is lower.  

That first area needs to be compared to the sum of the second and third areas.  If the sum of the second and third areas (OUWY) is larger than the first (OVZ), then pricing has higher welfare than remaining unpriced.  Similarly, two price levels can be compared.  In other words, the welfare gain from pricing is equal to the yellow + gray area (VUWX) minus the blue area (XYZ).  In this particular figure, consumer’s surplus is maximized when the good is free, but overall welfare (including producer’s surplus) is not.  Whether consumer’s surplus is in fact higher in a given situation depends on the slopes of the various demand curves.

The greatest welfare is achieved by maximizing the sum of the producer’s surplus rectangle and the consumer’s surplus “triangle” (it may not be a true triangle).  This must recognize that the consumers surplus triangle’s hypotenuse must follow an underlying demand curve, not the revealed demand curve.  Differentiating the level of service (for instance, providing two different levels of service at two different prices) may result in higher overall welfare (though not necessarily higher welfare for each individual).

== Use of the Revenue ==

How welfare is measured and how it is perceived are two different things.   If the producer’s surplus is not returned to the users of the system somehow the users will perceive an overall welfare gain as a personal loss because it would be acting as an additional tax.  The money can be returned through rebates of other taxes or reinvestment in transportation.    It should be noted that the entire argument can be made in reverse, where consumer and producers surplus are measured in time rather than money, and the level of service is the monetary cost of travel.  This however has less practical application.

== Pricing and Cost Recovery ==

In low volume situations, those that are uncongested, it is unlikely that the revenue from marginal cost congestion pricing will recover long term fixed costs.   This is because the marginal impacts of an additional car when volume is low is almost zero, so that additional revenue which can be raised with marginal cost pricing is also zero.  Imagine a road with one car - the car’s marginal impact is zero, a marginal cost price would also be zero, its revenue would thus be zero, which is less than the fixed costs.  

Add a second car, and marginal impacts are still nearly zero - a phenomenon which remains true until capacity is approached.

== Vickery’s Types of Congestion ==

* Simple interaction - light traffic, one car blocked by another, delay is proportional to Q^2
* Multiple interaction - 0.5 &lt; V/C &lt; 0.9 

&lt;math&gt;Z = t - t_{o} = 1/s - 1/s_{o} = ax^k&lt;/math&gt;

t actual time, to freeflow time, K ~ 3-5

* Bottleneck see below
* Triggerneck - overflow affects other traffic
* Network and Control - Traffic control devices transfer delay
* General Density - high traffic level in general


== Marginal Cost Pricing ==

Transportation is a broad field, attracting individuals with backgrounds in engineering, economics, and planning, among others who don’t share a common model or worldview about traffic congestion.  Economists look for received technological functions that can be analyzed, but risk misinterpreting them.  Engineers seek basic economic concepts to manage traffic, which they view as their own purview.  These two fields intersect in the domain of congestion pricing.  However many engineers view pricing with suspicion, believing that many economists are overstating its efficacy, while the economists are frustrated with engineering intransigence, and consider engineers as lacking understanding of basic market principles.

This section applies the microscopic model of traffic congestion that to congestion pricing, and allows us to critique the plausibility of several economic models of congestion that have appeared in the literature.

This section uses the idea of queueing and bottlenecks to explain congestion.  If there were no bottlenecks (which can be physical and permanent such as lane drops or steep grades, or variable such as a traffic control device, or temporary due to a crash), there would be very little congestion.  Vehicles interacting on an uncongested road lead to relatively minimal delays and are not further considered (Vickery 1969, Daganzo 1995) . We define congestion, or the congested period, to be the time when there is queueing.  This exceeds the time when arrivals exceed departures, as every vehicle has to wait for all previous vehicles to depart the front of the queue before it can.

A [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Queueing and Traffic Flow|previous section]] developed the queueing model of congestion.  

[[Image:CongestionPricingA.png|right|thumb|400px|Input output diagram at level of individual vehicle]]
[[Image:CongestionPricingB.png|right|thumb|400px|Marginal delay at level of individual vehicle]]

What is the implication of our queueing models for marginal cost pricing?

First, the use of hourly average time vs. flow functions such as the Bureau of Public Roads function, (which we introduced in the discussion of [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Route Choice|route choice]] (which approximates the hourly average delay from a queueing model) ignores that different vehicles within that hour have different travel times. They are at best useful for coarse macroscopic analyses, but should never be applied to the level of individual vehicles.

Second, travel time for a vehicle through a bottleneck depends on the number of vehicles that have come before, but not on the number of vehicles coming after.  Similarly, the marginal delay that a vehicle imposes is only imposed on vehicles that come after.  This implies that the first vehicle in the queue imposes the highest marginal delay, and the last vehicles in the queue have the lowest marginal delay.  A marginal delay function that looks like figure on the right (bottom) is generated from the typical input-output diagram shown on the figure on the right (top). If marginal cost were equal to the marginal delay, then our pricing function would be unusual, and perhaps unstable.  The instability might be tempered by making demand respond to price, rather than assuming it fixed (Rafferty and Levinson 2003), and by recognizing the stochastic nature of arrival and departure patterns, which would flatten the arrival curve to more closely resemble the departure curve, and thereby flatten the marginal delay curve. 

However, the idea that the first vehicle &quot;causes&quot; the delay is a controversial point.  Economists will sometimes argue Coase’s position (1992) – that it takes two to have a negative externality, that there would be no congestion externality but for the arrival of the following vehicles.  Coase is, of course, correct.  Moreover, they would note that charging a toll to the following vehicle will discourage that vehicle from coming and might also eliminate the congestion externality.  This may also be true.  This would however be charging the sufferer of congestion twice (once in terms of time, a second in terms of toll), while the person with the faster trip (earlier in the queue) wouldn’t pay at all.  Further, it is the followers who have already internalized the congestion externality in their decision making, so tolling them is charging them twice, in contrast to charging the leaders.  Given that charging either party could eliminate the externality, it would be more reasonable to charge the delayer than the delayed, which is much like the “polluter pays principle” advocated by environmentalists.  It would also be more equitable, in that total costs (congestion delay + toll) would now be equalized across travelers. The disadvantage of this is that the amount of the delay caused is unknown at the time that the first traveler passes; at best it can be approximated.

Implicitly, this privileges the “right to uncongested travel” over the “right to unpriced travel”.  That is a philosophical question, but given that there is to be some mechanism to finance highways, we can eliminate the notion of unpriced travel altogether, the remaining issue is how to implement financing: with insensitive prices like gas taxes or flat tolls or with time-dependent (or flow-dependent) congestion prices.

The marginal cost equals marginal delay formulation does ignore the question of schedule delay.  There are practical reasons for not including schedule delay in a marginal cost price.  Unlike delay, schedule delay is not easily measured.  While a road administrator can tell you from traffic counts how much delay a traveler caused, the administrator has no clue as to how much schedule delay was caused.  Second, if the late (early) penalty is large, then it dominates scheduling.  Travelers can decide whether they would rather endure arriving early (without delay) or arriving on time, with some delay (or some combination of the two), presumably minimizing their associated costs. If they choose the delay, it is the lower cost alternative.  That lower cost is the one they suffer, and thus that serves as a lower bound on the marginal cost to attribute to other travelers.  If they choose schedule delay (which then becomes the cost they face) and avoid the delay, they are affected as well by other travelers, but in a way that is unknown to pricing authorities. They are “priced out of the market”, which happens all the time. In short, endogenizing schedule delay would be nice, but requires more information than is actually available.

== Profit Maximizing Pricing ==

A realistic network of highway links is not, in the economists' terminology, perfectly competitive.  Because a link uniquely occupies space, it attains some semblance of monopoly power. While in most cases users can switch to alternative links and routes, those alternatives will be more costly to the user in terms of travel time. Theory suggests that excess profits will attract new entrants into a market, but the cost of building a new link is high, indicating barriers to entry not easily overcome.

Although roads are generally treated as public goods, they are both rivalrous when congested and in many cases excludable.  This indicates that it is feasible to consider them for privatization.  The advantages often associated with privatization are several: increasing the efficiency of the transportation system through road pricing, providing incentives for the facility operator to improve service through innovation and entrepreneurship, and reducing the time and cost of building and expanding infrastructure.


An issue little addressed is implementation. Most trials of road pricing suppose either tolls on a single facility, or area-wide control.  Theoretical studies often assume marginal cost pricing on links, and don't discuss ownership structure.  However, in other sectors of the economy, central control of pricing either through government ownership or regulation has proven itself less effective than decentralized control for serving customer demands in rapidly changing environments.  Single prices system-wide don’t provide as much information as link-specific prices.  Links which are priced only at marginal cost, the optimal solution in a first-best, perfectly competitive environment, constrain profit.  While in the short-term, excess profit is not socially optimal, over the longer term, it attracts capital and entrepreneurs to that sector of the economy.  New capital will both invest more in existing technology to further deploy it and enter the sector as competitors trying to gain from a spatial monopoly or oligopoly.  Furthermore, new capitalists may also innovate, and thereby change the supply (and demand) curves in the industry.

By examining road pricing and privatization from a decentralized point of view, the issues associated with a marketplace of roads can be more fully explored, including short and long term distributional consequences and overall social welfare.  The main contribution of this research will be to approach the problem from a theoretical and conceptual level and through the conduct of simulation experiments.   This analysis will identify salient empirical factors and critical parameters that determine system performance.  To the extent that available data from recent road pricing experiments becomes available, it may be used to compare with the results of the model.


=== Case 1. Simple Monopoly ===

	The simplest example is that of a monopoly link, &lt;math&gt;I-J &lt;/math&gt;

The link has elastic demand &lt;math&gt;Q_d&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;
Q_d =f (P)	
&lt;/math&gt;	
						
here given by a linear equation:

&lt;math&gt;
	Q_d = \beta_0 - \beta_1 P	 &lt;/math&gt; for all  &lt;math&gt;\beta_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \beta_1 &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;  		


The objective of the link is to maximize profit &lt;math&gt;\pi= P Q_d(P)&lt;/math&gt;.  Here we assume no congestion effects.  Profit is maximized when the first derivative is set to zero and the second derivative is negative.
&lt;math&gt;
	\pi= P Q_d(P) = P (\beta_0 - \beta_1P) = \beta_0P - \beta_1P^2
&lt;/math&gt;
Giving the following first order conditions (f.o.c.):
&lt;math&gt;
	\delta\pi/dP = \beta_0 - 2 \beta_1P = 0 
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
	P = \beta_0 / 2 \beta_1	
&lt;/math&gt;

Checking second order conditions (s.o.c.), we find them to be less than zero, as required for a maximum.

&lt;math&gt;
	\delta^2 \pi / \delta P^2 = - 2 \beta_1  &lt; 0	
&lt;/math&gt;

	For this example, if &lt;math&gt;\beta_0 = 1000&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_1 = 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P = 500&lt;/math&gt; gives &lt;math&gt;Q_d(P)=500&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;profit = 250,000&lt;/math&gt;.  This situation clearly does not maximize social welfare, defined as the sum of profit and consumer surplus.  Consumer surplus at &lt;math&gt;P=500&lt;/math&gt; for this demand curve is 125,000, giving a social welfare (SW) of 375,000.  Potential social welfare, maximized at &lt;math&gt;P=0&lt;/math&gt; (when links are costless), would be &lt;math&gt;500,000 &gt; 375,000&lt;/math&gt;, all of which comes from consumer surplus.

=== Case 2. Monopolistic Perfect Complements ===

	In a second simple example, we imagine two autonomous links, &lt;math&gt;I-J&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J-K&lt;/math&gt;, which are pure monopolies and perfect complements, one cannot be consumed without consuming (driving on) the other. The links are in series.

	In this case, demand depends on the price of both links, so we can illustrate by using the following general expression, and a linear example :
&lt;math&gt;
	Q_d = f(P_{ij} , P_{kl})
&lt;/math&gt;
		
&lt;math&gt;Q_d = \beta_0 - \beta_1 (P_{ij}+P_{jk})&lt;/math&gt;

Again we assume no congestion costs.  When we profit maximize, we attain a system which produces a Nash equilibrium that is both worse off for the owners of the links, who face lower profits, and for the users of the links, who face higher collective profits, than a monopoly.  Simply put, the links do not suffer the full extent of their own pricing policy as they would in the case of a monopoly, where the pricing externality is internalized.

&lt;math&gt;
	\pi_{ij} = P_{ij} Q_d(P) = P_{ij} (\beta_0 - \beta_1P_{ij} - \beta_1P_{jk}) = \beta_0P_{ij} - \beta_1P_{ij}^2 - \beta_1 P_{ij} P_{jk}
&lt;/math&gt;
	
&lt;math&gt;	
	\pi_{jk} = P_{jk} Q_d(P) = P_{jk} (\beta_0 - \beta_1P_{ij} - \beta_1P_{jk}) = \beta_0P_{jk} - \beta_1P_{jk}^2 - \beta_1 P_{ij} P_{jk}
&lt;/math&gt;
	
f.o.c.
&lt;math&gt;
	\delta \pi / dP_{ij} = \beta_0 - 2 \beta_1P_{ij} - \beta_1P_{jk} = 0 
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;	
	P_{ij} = (\beta_0- \beta_1P_{jk}) / 2 \beta_1
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;	
	\delta \pi / \delta P_{jk} = \beta_0 - 2 \beta_1P_{jk} - \beta_1P_{ij} = 0 
&lt;/math&gt;
	
&lt;math&gt;	
	P_{jk} = (\beta_0- \beta_1P_{ij}) / 2 \beta_1
&lt;/math&gt;

solving the f.o.c. simultaneously yields:

&lt;math&gt;
	P_{ij} = P_{jk} = \beta_0 (2 \beta_1-1) / ( 4 \beta_1^2 - \beta_1)
&lt;/math&gt;

checking the s.o.c.:
&lt;math&gt;
	\delta^2 \pi / \delta P_{ij}^2 = - 2 \beta_1 &lt; 0	
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;	
	\delta^2 \pi / \delta P_{jk}^2 = - 2 \beta_1 &lt; 0
&lt;/math&gt;

	At &lt;math&gt;\beta_0 = 1000&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_1 = 1&lt;/math&gt;, the solution is &lt;math&gt;P_{ij} = P_{jk} = 333.33&lt;/math&gt;, which gives &lt;math&gt;Q_d(P) = 333.33&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\pi_{ij}=\pi_{jk}=111,111&lt;/math&gt;, which is less total profit than the case of the simple monopoly. This situation results in total profit to both firms of 222,222, and a consumer surplus of 55,555, or total social welfare of 277,000, which is less than the results from the case of a simple monopoly.
	Similar arguments apply to three (or more) perfect complements, which are more and more dysfunctional if operated autonomously.  The general formula for N autonomous perfectly complementary links, with linear demand and  &lt;math&gt;\beta_1=1&lt;/math&gt;, is given by:

&lt;math&gt;	
	P = Q_d(P)= \beta_0/(N+1).
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Case 3. Duopoly of Perfect Substitutes ===

	In a third example, we imagine two parallel autonomous links, &lt;math&gt;I-J&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K-L&lt;/math&gt;, which serve the same, homogenous market.   They are perfect substitutes (operate in parallel).



	The optimal pricing for this case depends upon assumptions about how users distribute themselves across suppliers and the relationships between the links.  First, assume there are no congestion costs and time costs are otherwise equal and not a factor in the decision.  Do users simply and deterministically choose the lowest cost link, or are there other factors which shape this choice, so that a minor reduction in price will not attract all users from the other link?  For this example, we assume deterministic route choice, so demand chooses the lowest cost link, or splits between the links if they post the same price.  Here, demand is defined as below:
	
&lt;math&gt;	
	Q_d = f(P_{ij},P_{kl})
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;	
	Q_d = \beta_0 - \beta_1 min(P_{ij},P_{kl}).
&lt;/math&gt;
	
As before, let &lt;math&gt;\beta_0=1000&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta_1=1&lt;/math&gt;.  Also assume that competitive links can respond instantaneously.  Assume each link can serve the entire market, so that there are no capacity restrictions.
	Clearly there is a (welfare maximizing) stable equilibrium at &lt;math&gt;P=0&lt;/math&gt; (assuming equal and zero costs for the links), the result for a competitive system.  Demonstration: Suppose each link sets price 500, and had 250 users.  If link IJ lowers its prices by one unit to 499, it attains all 501 users, and profits on link IJ increase to 249,999 from 125,000.  However profits on link KL drop to 0.  The most profitable decision for KL is to lower its price to 498, attain 502 users, and profits of 249,996.  This price war can continue until profits are eliminated.  At any point in the process raising prices by one link alone loses all demand.
	
	However it seems unlikely in the case of only two links.  Therefore, if the links could coordinate their actions they would want to.  Even in the absence of formal cartels, strategic gaming and various price signaling methods are possible.   For instance, a far sighted link KL, seeing that a price war will ultimately hurt both firms, may only match the price cut rather than undercut in retaliation.  If IJ did not follow with a price cut, a price will be maintained.  It has been argued (Chamberlin 1933), that the duopoly would act as a monopoly, and both links would charge the monopoly price and split the demand evenly, because that is the best result for each since lowering prices will lead to a price war, with one link either matching or undercutting the other, in both cases resulting in smaller profits.

=== Case 4. Monopoly and Congestion ===

	The previous three cases did not exploit any special features of transportation systems.  In this case travel time is introduced on the network used in Case 1.  Here demand is a function of both Price (&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;) and Time (&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;):
	
&lt;math&gt;	
	Q_d = f(P,T)
&lt;/math&gt;

For this example is given by linear form:

&lt;math&gt;
	Q_d = \beta_0 - \beta_1P - \beta_2T
&lt;/math&gt;

where travel time is evaluated with the following expression incorporating both distance effects and congestion (queuing at a bottleneck over a fixed period with steady demand):

if &lt;math&gt;  (Q_d/Q_o) &lt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T = T_{f} &lt;/math&gt;

if &lt;math&gt;(Q_d/Q_o) \ge 1 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T=T_f + (C/2)((Q_d/Q_o) - 1)&lt;/math&gt;
	
where:	&lt;math&gt;T_f&lt;/math&gt; = freeflow travel time, 
	&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; = length of congested period, 
	&lt;math&gt;Q_o&lt;/math&gt; = maximum flow through bottleneck.

	Because &lt;math&gt;T_f&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, and we are dealing with only a single link, it can be combined with &lt;math&gt;\beta_0&lt;/math&gt; for the analysis and won’t be considered further.  By inspection, if &lt;math&gt;Q_o&lt;/math&gt; is large, it too does not figure into the analysis.  From Case 1, with the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; as given, &lt;math&gt;Q_o&lt;/math&gt; is only important if it is less than &lt;math&gt;Q_d = 500&lt;/math&gt;.  For this example then, we will set &lt;math&gt;Q_o&lt;/math&gt; at a value less than 500, in this case assume &lt;math&gt;Q_o = 250&lt;/math&gt;.
	
	As before, the objective of the link is to maximize profit &lt;math&gt;\pi= P Q_d(P)&lt;/math&gt;. Profit is maximized when the first derivative is set to zero and the second derivative is negative.
	
&lt;math&gt;\pi=PQ_d(P)=P(\beta_0-\beta_1P-\beta_2T)=\beta_0P-\beta_1P^2-\beta_2P(C/2)((Q_d/Q_o)-1)&lt;/math&gt;

Giving the following first order conditions (f.o.c.):

&lt;math&gt;\delta\pi/dP=\beta_0-2\beta_1P-\beta_2(C/2)((Q_d/Q_o)-1)=0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P = (\beta_0-\beta_2(C/2)((Q_d/Q_o)-1))/(2\beta_1)&lt;/math&gt;
	
Solving equations (4.2) and (4.6) simultaneously, at values: &lt;math&gt;\beta_0= 1000&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta_1= \beta_2 =1&lt;/math&gt;, reflecting that the value of time for all homogenous travelers is 1 in the chosen unit set,  &lt;math&gt;C=1800&lt;/math&gt;, representing 1800 time units (such as seconds) of congestion, we get the following answer: &lt;math&gt;P = Q_d = 339.3, T = 320.4&lt;/math&gt;.   It is thus to the advantage of the monopoly in the short term, with capacity fixed, to allow congestion (delay) to continue, rather than raising prices high enough to eliminate it entirely.  In the longer term, capacity expansion (which reduces delay), will allow the monopoly to charge a higher price.  In this case,&lt;math&gt; \pi=115,600&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;consumer surplus = 57,800&lt;/math&gt;.  There is a large deadweight loss to congestion, as can be seen by comparing with Case 1.

=== Simulation ===

More complex networks are not easily analyzed in the above fashion.  Links serve as complements and substitutes at the same time.  Simulation models address the same questions posed in the analytic model on more complex networks, that is, what are the performance measures and market organization under different model parameters and scenarios.  Second, we can consider market organization within the model framework, so that the question becomes: What market organization emerges under alternative assumptions, and what are the social welfare consequences of the organization?

Competing links restrict the price that an autonomous link can charge and still maximize profits.  Furthermore, it is likely that government regulations will ultimately constrain prices, though the level of regulation may provide great latitude to the owners.  It is anticipated that each link will have an objective function for profit maximization.   However, depending upon assumptions of whether the firm perfectly knows market demand, and how the firm treats the actions of competitors, the Nash equilibrium solution to the problem may not be unique, or even exist. 

Because the demand on a link depends on the price of both upstream and downstream links, its complements, revenue sharing between complementary links, and the concomitant coordination of prices, may better serve all links, increasing their profits as well as increasing social welfare. Vertical integration among highly complementary links is Pareto efficient. 

It is widely recognized that the roadway network is subject to economies of density, at least up to a point.  This means that as the flow of traffic on a link increases, all else equal, the average cost of operating the link declines.   It is less clear if links are subject to economies of scale, that it is cheaper per unit of output (for instance per  passenger kilometer traveled) to build and manage two links, a longer link, or a wider link than it is to build and manage a single link, a shorter link, or a narrower link.   If there are such economies of scale, then link cost functions should reflect this. 

Different classes of users (rich or poor; or cars, buses, or trucks) have different values of time.  The amount of time spent on a link depends upon flow on that link, which in turn depends on price.  It may thus be a viable strategy for some links to price high and serve fewer customers with a high value of time, and others to price low and serve more customers with a lower value of time.  It is hypothesized that in a sufficiently complex network, such distinct pricing strategies should emerge from simple profit maximizing rules and limited amounts of coordination.



There are a number of parameters and rules to be considered in such simulation model, some are listed below.  


==== Parameters ====

''Network Size and Shape''.  The first issue that must be considered is the size of network in terms of  the number of links and nodes and how those links connect, determined by the shape of the network  (symmetric: grid, radial;  asymmetric).  While the research will begin with a small network, it is possible that the equilibrium conditions found on limited networks may not emerge on more complex networks, giving cause for considering a more realistic system.

''Demand Size and Shape''.  A second issue is the number of origin-destination markets served by the network, the level of demand, and the number of user classes (each with a different value of time).  Again, while the research will begin with very simple assumptions, the results under simple conditions may be very different from those under slightly more complex circumstances.

==== Rules ====

''Profit Seeking''.  How do autonomous links determine the profit maximizing price in a dynamic situation?   Underlying the decision of each autonomous link is an objective function, profit maximization given certain amounts of information, and a behavioral rule which dictates the amount and direction of price changes depending on certain factors.  Once a link has found a toll which it can neither raise nor lower without losing profit, it will be tempted to stick with it. However, a more intelligent link may realize that while it may have found a local maxima, because of the non-linearities comprising a complex network, it may not be at a global maxima.  Furthermore other links may not be so firmly attached to their decision, and a periodic probing of the market landscape by testing alternative prices is in order.  This too requires rules.

''Revenue Sharing''.  It may be advantageous for complementary links to form coalitions to coordinate their action to maximize their profit.  How do these coalition form?  By the inclusion of a share of the profits of other links in one link’s objective function, that link can price more appropriately. What level of revenue sharing, between 0 and 100 percent is best?  These questions need to be tested with the model.  An interlink negotiation process will need to be developed.

''Cost Sharing''. Similar to revenue sharing is the sharing of certain expenses that each link faces.  Links face large expenses periodically, such as resurfacing or snow clearance in winter, that have economies of scale.  These economies of scale may be realized either through single ownership of a great many links or through the formation of economic networks.  Just as revenue sharing between links is a variable which can be negotiated, so is cost sharing.

''Rule Evaluation and Propagation''.  A final set of considerations is the possibility of competition between rules.  If we consider the rules to be identified with the firms which own links or shares of links, and set pricing policy, the rules can compete.  Accumulated profits can be used by more successful rules to buy shares from less successful rules.  The decision to sell will compare future expected profits under current management with the lump sum payment by a competing firm.  An open market in the shares of links will need to be modeled to test these issues.  Similarly, it may be possible to model rules which learn, and obtain greater intelligence iteration to iteration.

== Discussion ==

Just as airline networks seem to have evolved a hub and spoke hierarchy, a specific geometry may be optimal in a private highway network.  Initial analysis indicates that there are advantages to both the private and social welfare to vertical integration of highly complementary links.  However the degree of complementarity for which integration serves both public and private interests remains to be determined.  Other issues that are to be examined include the influence of substitutes and degree of competition on pricing policies through cross-elasticity of demand, economies of scale in the provision of infrastructure, multiple classes of users with different values of time, “free” roads competing with toll roads, and the consequences of regulatory constraints.  Using the principles developed under the analytic approach, a repeated game of road pricing by autonomous links learning the behavior of the system through adaptive expectation will be developed.

No. Thanks. Really?  It's all madness. Seriously.

== Welcome back ==

Hi Lwan98,

Welcome back to Wikibooks - it's nice to have you back again.  I hope you had a good summer! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 15:51, 31 August 2007 (UTC)

== Volcanoes ==

Hi Lwan,

I notice you removed all the content from the Volcanoes page in your sandbox.  I'm guessing Google found it because I changed the honor_header template to do automatic categorization (that's how I found the page anyhow).  Of course, removing the content does not get rid of the old page - it's all still there under the history tab.  If you want, I can delete it for you, but I would urge you to not do that.

Rather, I think we should move it into the regular name space and add &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Proposed Honors]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the page.  Once the honor is approved, we can make any necessary edits and then add it to the Nature page. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 13:40, 18 October 2007 (UTC)

* Hey Jim, I knew that wikibooks kept a copy/history of it. I wanted to throw off Google although I think Google is smarter than me. I'd simply edited the page, copied all the contents, and created a new page (because I need the info) still in my Sandbox prefixed by the intials of United States and the postal abbreviation for the state. I'm not sure what's best for the Florida honors and if this is the forum for it (seems logical, but then we might get into hierarchal(sp?) issues). I'm keeping it in my sandbox for the present. Might process other Florida honors. ~Lester 14:53, 21 October 2007 (UTC)

*'''Ha!''' I see you've been hard at work [Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/'''Florida Conference''']. Guess that's where I'll put it. ~Lester 14:53, 21 October 2007 (UTC)

: Chuckle - believe it or not, that category was created semi-autonomously.  I changed the honor_header template to create categories.  I did edit your header, to separate the &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;Florida Conference&quot; into two fields.  The fourth field automatically becomes a category.  I wouldn't mind at all if we added more FL conf honors.  It needn't mess with the hierarchy either - just file Volcanoes under Nature, and we can slap together an icon for all FL honors.  It will automatically go into the FL category.  I've even been thinking about deleting the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Division]] page all together.  It just doesn't make sense to me to divide them out like that, especially since we have categories now. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 15:38, 21 October 2007 (UTC)

:: Okay, you can delete &quot;User:Lwan98/Sandbox/Volcanoes‎&quot; now, since I've moved the ''real one'' under Nature. ~lester 13:36, 22 October 2007 (UTC)

== Currency template ==
Good exclusion. I should have thought of that and the appearance if it, but that just flew past me ;&lt; ~lester 15:13, 1 November 2007 (UTC)
: The image had been deleted from the Commons.  I didn't mind so much that it was in the gallery, but at the same time felt no burden to find a replacement image. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 15:26, 1 November 2007 (UTC)

== Commons Upload ==

Hi Lester,

I fixed the problem you were having with the water knot image.  The original image was uploaded to Wikipedia rather than to the Commons.  To fix that, you hafta download a full resolution image to your own computer, then upload it to the commons.  If you select the &quot;It is from another Wikimedia project&quot; option, the next page will have a link at the top to the [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~magnus/commonshelper.php CommonsHelper tool] which is very nice.  Go there, paste in the image name, and submit.  Then copy the junk they give you in that window into the edit window at the commons.  Voila, all the info from Wikipedia is retained. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 18:40, 5 November 2007 (UTC)
* Ya! Commons was having a problem this mornin' and gave me an error, so I was jest waitin' out the server/error. Thanks. ~Lester 18:43, 5 November 2007 (UTC)
* Grr! My locale must be stoppin' my uploads. Will have to get to it later. ~Lester 19:00, 5 November 2007 (UTC)

== Stages ==

Hi Lwan,

The stage and stage_short templates only accept No_work, 00%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% as the progress parameter.  I have been interpreting 75% to mean &quot;at least 75%, but less than 100%&quot;, so I changed your 90 to 75 for Lighthouses - Advanced.  I have also been going by whether or not x% of the requirements have been completely answered, and counting half-answered requirements as contributing nothing.  In a nutshell:

* No_work means the requirements are there, but no answers are.
* 00%  means some answers are there, but less than 25% of the requirements have complete answers.
* 25%  means at least 25% of the requirements have complete answers, but fewer than 50% do.
* etc.
* 100% means all requirements have enough answers so that the honor can be earned with what's there.

An example would be the chemistry honor, which we declared complete before all the experiments were explained.  The requirement was to do 5 of the ten that were listed, so we could mark it as complete as soon as 5 were ready.  We did go on to add the other five, and we did use the TODO template to indicate that more work was needed on that honor.

Hope that clears a few things up.  Thanks for your work! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 18:03, 22 January 2008 (UTC)

:* sorry - jumped the gun - had just one more item to research/add. done now. Lester, 18:14, 22 January 2008 (UTC)


==Question?==
The following look complete to me:
* http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Adventist_Youth_Honors_Answer_Book/Nature/Cats_-_Advanced
* http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Adventist_Youth_Honors_Answer_Book/Nature/Maple_Sugar_-_Advanced
and since I did no work on them, I don't want to inadvertently get credit for marking it complete.
----
: I have never interpreted marking them as complete as taking credit for them.  

: I did the work on Cats - Advanced, but didn't do anything for requirement 3.  It's been almost 30 years since I had a cat, which disqualifies me as an expert dispenser of cat care information.  At a minimum, the subquestions in requirement three should be answered first (such as &quot;Why should your cat not be allowed to roam the neighborhood free?&quot; and &quot;explain the relationship of house cats on the environment and why it is best they not be allowed to become feral.&quot;  Also, some tips for contacting a local humane society (check the yellow pages?) should be added.

: For Maple Sugar, we need: 
:* Detailed instruction for tapping a tree.  
:* Where can the equipment be found? 
:* How do you boil it down (this is normally done outside with a fire which must be fed for several ''hours'').
:* A picture of the bark and a leaf.
:* How do I find a sugaring operation?
:* Three recipes

: That's why I have not marked them as complete. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 16:25, 28 January 2008 (UTC)
::Gotcha! Thanks for the clarification ~Lester 17:17, 28 January 2008 (UTC)</text>

== &lt;big&gt;Using the sequencer to compile frames into an animation&lt;/big&gt; ==

== Preamble ==

When you render an animation, often it's a good idea to render the individual frames and then compile them into the animation. This has several benefits over rendering directly to a movie file. Some of them are these:
**If you discover a mistake in the render, you can modify sections of the animation and rerender those frames without having to rerender the whole animation.
**If the render crashes because the power went out or, (psst), blender crashed, you can pick up the render at the last rendered frame without having to rerender the whole animation

== Tutorial ==
*Open your animation in blender
Begin by opening blender to an animation that is ready to be rendered. 

*Set the render output to targa format.
press F10 to go the scene buttons and set the output format to Targa. Though you can use any image format you want, I use Targa because it has no compression and is at 100% quality.

[[Image:1 SetOutputFormat.jpg]]


*Set the file output location.
Set the location on your file system where you want all the frames to be saved to. 

'''IMPORTANT: Make sure that there is a slash at the end or else you are setting a filename not a filepath'''

[[Image:2_SetSaveLocation.jpg]]


*Set Endframe to match the animation
If you animated 500 frames, set the end frame to that same number.
the default is 250.

[[Image:3_SetEndFrame.jpg]]


*Render the animation!
Simply press the &quot;Anim&quot; button.

[[Image:4_RenderAnimButton.jpg]]

----

== Use the Sequencer to compile the images into a movie file ==

*Open a new blender and delete everything except the camera.

*Change the 3d window into the sequencer window.
(See image for explanation)

[[Image:5_Change3D_WinToSeqWin.jpg]]


*Add the images to the sequencer.
On the bottom of the sequencer window click Add&gt;&gt;Images then browse to the location where you saved the images, Press Cntrl-A (on linux enter &quot;*.tga&quot; or &quot;*.jpg&quot; in the field for filename) to select all the images and finally press “Select Image&quot; on the top-right. Attached to your mouse curser will be a long horizontal bar which represents all the images. Move it all the way to the left till the little number underneath it shows &quot;1&quot; and then Left-mouseclick to place it.

[[Image:6_SeqWinAddImages.jpg]]
[[Image:7_SeqImagesPlacement.jpg]]

*Set final movie format.
Note that you can also set the location that the movie is saved to by changing the path we set earlier.
[[Image:8_SetMovieFormat.jpg]]

*Enable Sequence render and animate!
Depress the Do Sequence button and press the Animate button and wait a few seconds till it's done. Browse to the location you saved your movie and enjoy the animation.

I hope you found this tutorial useful. If there are any errors in the tutorial, ''Please'' let me know, and I will fix them as soon as possible.

Blend happy and save often, --[[User:Radialronnie|Radialronnie]] ([[User talk:Radialronnie|talk]]) 22:47, 3 November 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The lifetimes of stars are determined by their mass, or the total amount of matter they contain. If an object is not sufficiently massive (at least about one tenth the mass of our Sun), it will not have enough gravity to squeeze itself tightly enough to heat itself up to stellar levels. Such an object will become either a planet-like body or an intermediate object called a &quot;brown dwarf.&quot; A &quot;brown dwarf&quot; simply never initiates stable hydrogen fusion and by definition never becomes a full-fledged star. Some brown dwarfs go through a phase of limited &quot;deuterium fusion&quot;, but this does not qualify to make them a full star. They eventually -- after very long periods of time -- simply go out and cool to the ambient temperature of the Universe.

Gas clouds (or just localized areas of larger gas clouds) that have at least one tenth the mass of the Sun, can get hot enough as they contract to start fusing hydrogen into helium. This is known a &quot;stable hydrogen fusion&quot; and it marks the birth of a true star. This requires temperatures in the millions of degrees. However, stars of such relatively low mass can sustain only very low levels of fusion, which is to say that they use their nuclear fuel slowly. So they do not grow very bright, and form small dim stars called red dwarfs. 

Generally, red dwarfs go through their lifetimes uneventfully, just slowly &quot;burning&quot; their nuclear fuel in a stable fashion. Eventually, they will run out of nuclear fuel, cool, and slowly become a burned out cinder known as a &quot;black dwarf.&quot;

Do not confuse the terms brown dwarf, red dwarf and black dwarf. A brown dwarf has a mass too low to ever become a star. It produces energy, perhaps even by a limited type of fusion, but never enough for &quot;stable hydrogen fusion. A red dwarf has low mass, but high enough to start stable hydrogen fusion, which qualifies it as a &quot;real&quot; star. However, it burns that fuel so slowly that it has a very long lifetime. It is likely that any red dwarf ever born since the Big Bang is still around, and has not yet turned into its final version, the &quot;black dwarf.&quot; Considering the extremely long lifetimes of red dwarfs, it is likely that no black dwarfs have yet formed in the Universe.

Do not confuse the term &quot;black dwarf&quot; with &quot;black hole&quot;, which is an utterly different object with a different origin.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A supply chain can be better thought of as a web—an interconnected chain of &quot;nodes,&quot; in this case, suppliers. In short, a supply chain is a network of distributors (of materials or finished products) and transporters (again, of materials or finished products). A supply chain may be simple or complex, depending on the situation and the industry.

Now for a general question about networks: what is the difference between economic analysis of networks and network analysis of the economy? Economic analysis of networks is required to understand and predict the deployment of advanced technologies, such as road pricing, and how those technologies interact and depend on each other. The central idea of a network is links that reinforce each other. These links can be physical (threads, wires, beams, highways, rails, pipes) or socioeconomic (kinship, social, or exchange  relationships). The market, on the other hand, is a place where exchange of goods takes place. An economic network may be comprised of multiple markets. A market may sell the right to use, or the ownership of, physical networks.

== Network Model of the Economy ==
''Levinson, David and Kevin Krizek (2008) [http://nexus.umn.edu/Books/PNP.html  Planning for Place and Plexus: Metropolitan Land Use and Transport]. Routledge''

=== Nomenclature ===
[[Image:TE-SupplyChains-NetworkModelOfEconomy.png]]

Legend:
* Agent: stage s, market m, firm number n
* Open or hatched circles indicate production/consumption agent nodes
* Filled circles indicate market or exchange nodes
* Lines indicate links connection markets and agents 

There are three main elements: 
* the site of production/consumption (material transformation), 
* the site of exchange (ownership transformation), 
* and the connection between the two (spatio-temporal transformation).


While each of these elements is modeled as a link or node, it should be remembered that each can be expanded to form a subnetwork of itself if there is a desire to increase the detail or resolution of the analysis.   A production/consumption agent in an economic network has both suppliers and customers, and can be modeled as an “agent node” on a network. Because production and consumption are two sides of the same coin, they are referred to together, any process consumes inputs to produce outputs. The “exchange nodes” are defined by the convergence of “connection links,” and are analogous to markets.   

=== Linking Economy with Transportation ===

Clearly this situation is idealized.  Some firms may have different degrees of vertical integration, that is they may internalize what is represented here as an input market or the output market.  However, this figure does reflect that a production process may have economies of scope, so that a single firm produces for more than one output market, as is shown in Figure 1 between Stage 2 and Stage 3.  In the illustration, there are three stages (1,2,3 from left to right) several markets in each stage (for instance a market for capital and a market for labor) and multiple firms in each market.  Extending the chain far enough to the left and to the right, and incorporating enough of the economy, the markets connect with each other again, as the ultimate final consuming agent is the individual consuming goods and an ultimate input agent is an individual producing labor.

To compare with a conventional transportation network, a roadway link is a composite of the “agent node” and the “connection link”.  For each link on a highway, there is only one input market and one output market, each identified with a single node (an intersection), which makes the graphic representation and analysis simpler as the agent nodes are unnecessary  because the transformation is only spatial, not material.  While there is “conservation of flow” in the network, flows can be one way, the link moves traffic in one direction with nothing in return.  As part of a larger system, the link (more precisely, an agent: Department of Transportation, Turnpike Authority, private firm acting on behalf of the link) receives revenue from government or users, which is used to maintain the link.  

=== Payment ===
In one sense, the link is selling the right to be traveled on and is paid by users or government for this right.  
If it is not paid, it deteriorates over time (the payment comes from the link’s own capital stock which is dissipated). 
The more generalized version of a graphed economy subsumes the transportation network as a special case.  The use of this framework serves to incorporate, at least conceptually, financing in the standard highway network analysis, and thereby allows us to identify some pertinent issues.  

In particular if we identify links with firms, the issue of payment becomes clear. In order to operate, the link must be subsidized by government, be paid for directly by users, or allow its capital stock to deteriorate.  Direct payment from users equal to the marginal cost is clearly more efficient, it does not entail the social loss described in section 2 due to overuse and subsidy, and does not impose deadweight losses inherent in certain taxing structures.  Imposing road pricing is a natural conclusion to these problems.

=== Snapshot ===

Figure 1 is a snapshot, it describes the processes and relationships at a given point or window of time.  Over a long period of time, links and nodes are added and deleted as the economy grows and contracts, markets change, and innovation occurs in response to entrepreneurship and invention.  The purpose of this analysis is to provide a tool to examine how networks and relationships in general do happen.  We might extend the standard network flow idea of the least cost path to the process.  Then “final” customers on the right side purchase a bundle of goods which provides the highest utility or lowest cost, profit seeking production/consumption agents in the middle will act as efficient customers for the initial producers on the left, and efficient producers/transformers in their own right.  The network will generate welfare maximizing flows under the usual strong assumptions from microeconomics:  well defined property rights and the absence of externalities (or when there is internalization of externalities), the presence of competitive links throughout, convex cost functions, etc.  The interesting cases are in the absence of one or more of those conditions.  Furthermore, the degree to which the network itself is efficient is another, much more complex (and important) question.

== Supply Chains ==
''Ram Ganeshan, Terry P. Harrison,'' ''[http://lcm.csa.iisc.ernet.in/scm/supply_chain_intro.html An Introduction to Supply Chain Management]''

&quot;A supply chain is a network of facilities and distribution options that performs the functions of procurement of materials, transformation of these materials into intermediate and finished products, and the distribution of these finished products to customers.&quot;

&quot;Supply chains exist in both service and manufacturing organizations, although the complexity of the chain may vary greatly from industry to industry and firm to firm.&quot;

=== Single-Product Chain ===
[[Image:TE-SupplyChains-SingleProduct.png|thumb|right | Single product supply chain based on Ram Ganeshan and Terry P. Harrison]]

&quot;To the right is an example of a very simple supply chain for a single product, where raw material is procured from vendors, transformed into finished goods in a single step, and then transported to distribution centers, and ultimately, customers. Realistic supply chains have multiple end products with shared components, facilities and capacities. The flow of materials is not always along an arborescent network, various modes of transportation may be considered, and the bill of materials for the end items may be both deep and large.&quot;

=== Supply Chain Decisions ===
&quot;We classify the decisions for supply chain management into two broad categories -- strategic and operational.&quot; 

* Location Decisions 
* Production Decisions 
* Inventory Decisions 
* Transportation Decisions

== Modeling Approaches ==

Network Design methods, for the most part, provide normative models for the more strategic decisions. Optimization of system.
Inventory Control methods, on the other hand, give guiding policies for the operational decisions. These models typically assume a &quot;single site&quot; (i.e., ignore the network) and add supply chain characteristics to it, such as explicitly considering the site's relation to the others in the network.  These derive from Inventory Control optimization Simulation methods are used to evaluate the effectiveness of a pre-specified policy rather than develop new ones. It is the traditional question of &quot;What If?&quot; versus &quot;What's Best?&quot;.

== Bullwhip effect ==
{{see also|w:Bullwhip_effect|l1=Bullwhip effect}}

Because customer demand is rarely perfectly stable, businesses must forecast demand to properly position inventory and other resources. Forecasts are based on statistics, and they are rarely perfectly accurate. Because forecast errors are a given, companies often carry extra goods (an inventory buffer) called &quot;safety stock&quot; to account for and take advantage of possible unpredicted increases in demand. Moving up the supply chain from end-consumer to raw materials supplier, each supply chain participant has greater observed variation in demand and thus greater need for safety stock. In periods of rising demand, down-stream participants increase orders. In periods of falling demand, orders fall or stop to reduce inventory. The effect is that variations are amplified as one moves &quot;upstream&quot; in the supply chain (further from the customer).

The [[w:Beer distribution game|Beer Distribution Game]], developed by the MIT Sloan School of Management in the 1960s, is an excellent simulation of the sequence of events. In the game, several teams of at least four players are in competition to meet demand for beer casings, however, only one player has knowledge of actual customer demand. Verbal communication between team members is prohibited, resulting in both massive backlogs and massive inventory buildups—the bullwhip effect, as well as frantic players.

== Freight Logistics ==

Freight Logistics is the process of planning, implementing and controlling the efficient, effective flow and storage of raw materials, in-process inventory, finished goods, services and related information from point of origin to point of consumption to meet customer demands.

This management is increasingly important as producers move from a inventory based system (push) to a just-in-time system (pull). This is enabled by (and demands) reliable transportation and information technology. The process is multi-modal or inter-modal, that is, it uses multiple modes of transportation. Most products are loaded and unloaded multiple times at various stages within the logistics cycle.

Freight tons per capita has been increasing slowly (about 0.1% per year), but freight ton-miles has been increasing at more than 1% per year. In other words, freight being shipped farther and farther.

=== Railroads===
Railroads move low value commodities long distances slowly (e.g. coals, chemicals, farm products), as well as large items that can't be easily or efficiently moved by truck (e.g. cars and large machinery).

Class I—major railroads 
* Western (east west) Burlington Northern/Santa Fe, Union Pacific, 
* Eastern (east west) CSX, Norfolk Southern,
* Central (north south) Chicago and Northwestern, Illinois Central, Kansas City Southern, Grand Trunk Western (Canadian National), and Soo Line (Canadian Pacific).

Class II—regional and short line railroads

=== Trucks===
Trucks  move higher value products short distances rapidly.

Truckload—one shipment, one truck

Less than Truckload (LTL)—multiple shippers use same truck.

Some owned by manufacturers, some by private trucking firms, some by publicly held (stock market) trucking firms.

Small trucks are often used as private vehicles, so truck statistics need to be considered with care. Almost 60,000,000 trucks in United States.

=== Low Cost Envelope ===

Which mode is selected depends on which mode has the lowest cost, typically this can be illustrated with the low cost envelope:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Smart Pointers ==
Using raw pointers to store allocated data and then cleaning them up in the destructor can generally be considered a very bad idea since it is error-prone.  Even temporarily storing allocated data in a raw pointer and then deleting it when done with it should be avoided for this reason.  For example, if your code throws an exception, it can be cumbersome to properly catch the exception and delete all allocated objects.  

Smart pointers can alleviate this headache by using the compiler and language semantics to ensure the pointer content is automatically released when the pointer itself goes out of scope.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;memory&gt;
class A
{
public:
        virtual ~A() {}
	virtual char val() = 0;
};

class B : public A
{
public:
	virtual char val() { return 'B'; }
};

A* get_a_new_b()
{
	return new B();
}

bool some_func()
{
	bool rval = true;
	std::auto_ptr&lt;A&gt; a( get_a_new_b() );
	try {
		std::cout &lt;&lt; a-&gt;val();
	} catch(...) {
		if( !a.get() ) {
			throw &quot;Memory allocation failure!&quot;;
		}
		rval = false;
	}
	return rval;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

{{TODO|Could note that the '''rebind''' pattern used by allocators is an alternative to using a template template parameter.  Historically the STL was largely developed before C++ compilers offered support for template template parameters.  Interestingly, modern template metaprogramming style has promoted a rebind-like approach instead of using template template parameters.|C++ Programming}}

==Semantics==
&lt;!-- Section content copied from http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Auto_ptr&amp;oldid=267300087 --&gt; 
The auto_ptr has semantics of strict ownership, meaning that the auto_ptr instance is the sole entity responsible for the object's lifetime. If an auto_ptr is copied, the source loses the reference. For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;memory&gt;
using namespace std;
 
int main(int argc, char **arv)
{
    int *i = new int;
    auto_ptr&lt;int&gt; x(i);
    auto_ptr&lt;int&gt; y;
    
    y = x;
    
    cout &lt;&lt; x.get() &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; y.get() &lt;&lt; endl;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This code will print a NULL address for the first auto_ptr object and some non-NULL address for the second, showing that the source object lost the reference during the assignment (''=''). The raw pointer &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; in the example should not be deleted, as it will be deleted by the auto_ptr that owns the reference.  In fact, &lt;code&gt;new int&lt;/code&gt; could be passed directly into x, eliminating the need for &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;.

Notice that the object pointed by an auto_ptr is destructed using &lt;code&gt;operator delete&lt;/code&gt;; this means that you should only use auto_ptr for pointers obtained with &lt;code&gt;operator new&lt;/code&gt;. This excludes pointers returned by &lt;code&gt;malloc(), calloc() or realloc()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;operator new[]&lt;/code&gt;.

      <comment>/* Far-Western Blotting */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Western Blotting is another technique that utilizes [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein function/Antibodies|antibodies]] to detect the presence of a specific [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]] in a sample. It is capable of detecting small amounts of protein within a cell or body fluid. Western blotting grants the ability to find proteins in a mixture.

Western blotting, which originated from the laboratory of George Stark at Stanford, is the technique for detecting a particular protein by staining with specific antibody. Its analysis can give us the information about the size of the protein or how much protein accumulated in cells. It does not mean that it can do for any protein since in the case the protein is degraded quickly; it is hard to detect it well. 
The important thing in this technique is antibody since Western blotting is based on the use of a “quality” antibody as a probe to detect specific protein. In this technique, first we separate the protein by using SDS-poly-acryl-amide gel electrophoresis, which base on the protein’s size. Later, those proteins on the gel are transferred to the surface of a polymer sheet by blotting.  As soon as we add antibody that is specific for the desired protein to the sheet, it will bind to this protein since they have nothing else to bind to. Later, we wash unbound primary antibody, and this protein-primary antibody can be detected by secondary antibody. Those secondary antibody can only recognize the primary antibody and many of them bind to one primary antibody and give out the signal, which is a radioactive label on the secondary antibody produces a dark band on X-ray film.

==Techniques==
[[Image:Western Blot.png‎|thumb|The results of a Western Blot]]

#Sample undergoes [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification/SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis|SDS PAGE]] (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate - Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis) in which SDS detergent is attached to proteins, giving them negative charge relative to size so that proteins migrate to positive charged cathode. Larger proteins move slower through the acrylamide gel matrix whereas smaller proteins can move faster resulting in a distinct gradient of bands separated based on speed of travel through the matrix and subsequently size.
#The resulting bands of proteins are transferred onto a polymer sheet (nitrocellulose filter or polyvinylidene difluoride, PVDF) that binds proteins. This allows the proteins to bind to antibodies.
#Since the polymer sheet binds all proteins, the remaining empty space on the sheet must be blocked so it does not react with the antibody. This is done by washing the polymer sheet in non-fat dry milk, which contains casein (a protein), which will cover the rest of the sheet.
#The sheet is then incubated with the primary antibody specific for the target protein. After washed and diluted, the sheet is again incubated with the secondary antibody, which binds to the primary antibody. Usually, this secondary antibody is fuorescent or radioactive labeled. The sheet is again washed and diluted.
#The sheet is incubated with the enzyme substrate that would make the secondary antibody to emit light. Photographic films will detect this light as dark bands. The radioactive labeled antibodies are detected with X-ray films.

'''Factors Influencing Transfer'''

''The buffer''

A buffer that is commonly used for transfer is Tris-glycine which has pH 8.3 with a low concentration of SDS and 20% methanol. Glycine is used instead of Cl because it has a lower charge density and less current means less heat production. At this pH, many proteins will have a slightly negative charge which will make proteins transfer our easier since they will tend to move towards the positive charged electrode. SDS favors elution from the gel because it covers protein with negative charge. But if the protein is too negatively charged the hydrophobic membrane will repel the protein hence the protein will be less likely to transfer onto the membrane. To prevent that, methanol will be use to remove SDS from proteins which covers hydrophobic sites on the protein which can then bind to the membrane. If there is no methanol, elution from the gel is favored but binding to the membrane is poor. If there is too much methanol then the SDS could all come off before proteins leave the gel and the exposed hydrophobic regions could aggregate forming large protein aggregates that would be trapped in gel hence cannot transfer out.

''The Membrane''

There are different kinds of membrane with different pore sizes. The most commonly used membrane has pore sizes around 0.45 micrometer but smaller pore sizes are necessary to efficiently trap proteins that has size less than 20kDa.

''Voltage during transfer''

The current is more critical than the voltage. One of the factors here is the heating. The second factor is that if the current is too high, proteins with low molecular weight will move through the membrane so fast that they do not have a chance to bind with the membrane.

''Time to transfer'' 

The migration of the proteins will depend on the sizes. The larger the size of protein the longer time it will take to migrate. Sometimes two layers of membrane are placed next to the gel to trap smaller proteins that might pass through the first membrane. 

''Protein charge''

If a protein has positively charged after SDS removed then they will be difficult to transfer. Since their isoelectric points can be similar to the pH of the buffer system. Hence, the protein will not migrate toward the positive electrode and not transfer onto the membrane. We can solve this problem by raising the buffer system to higher pH.

==Advantages of Western Blotting==

•Western blotting is effective and useful method to detect and characterize proteins in small amounts, such as clock proteins. Moreover, clock proteins’ other properties like half-life, molar amounts can also be found using western blotting.

•Immunogenic responses from infectious agents (ex. viruses, bacteria) are hard to find since they are difficult to isolate from patient sample. But Western blotting can detect this.

•Western Blotting utilizes not only antigens, but also antisera as a diagnostic tool. Antisera is widely used in the test for HIV presence.

•Compared to ELISA, Western blotting has higher specificity; the higher specificity, the more the method is independent of the specificity of antibodies.

•Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), or Nylon, is often used as membrane in Western blotting, since it has a high protein-binding capacity and chemical stability. Even, some protein groups only bind to Nylon or favor strongly to it.  

•Among three common enzyme substrates, Fluorescent and Chemiluminescent create light detectable through X-ray or scanners. This ability enables high levels of sensitivity and quicker processing time.

==Disadvantages of Western Blotting==

•A non-intended protein has a slight chance of reacting with the secondary anti-body, resulting in the labeling of an incorrect protein.

•Incidental phosphorylation or oxidation of proteins may result in multiple bands appearing after sample is processed.

•The appearance of bubbles may occur when transferring the sample from the gel/membrane sandwich and may also occur when incubating the sample with antibodies, resulting in a skewed band reading.

•If the transfer time is not sufficient when transferring proteins to the membrane, the larger proteins of higher molecular weight will not transfer properly, resulting in an incorrect or no band reading at all.

•Too much methanol in the transfer buffer decreases the transfer efficiency of proteins from the gel to the membrane; however methanol aids in protein binding to several different membranes, so a correct balance is required.

•Western Blotting is a very delicate process requiring the correct amounts of each component in order for successful identification of the presence of proteins.  An imbalance in any step of the procedure may skew the entire process.

== Far-Western Blotting ==

Far- western blotting is  based on the Western blotting technique. The major difference is that  far-western  uses  non-antibody  proteins which  can  bind to the desired protein.  Far-western is used  to detect protein protein interactions.

== Eastern Blotting==

Eastern blotting is an extension of western blotting and is used in the detection of protein post-translational modifications. Eastern blotting is used to detect lipoylated, glycosylated or phosphorylated proteins or proteins with other post translational modifications. Blotting is mostly  done from a SDS-PAGE gel on to a PVDF or nitrocellulose membrane. Post translational protein modifications including phosphorylation,  lipoylation, glycosylation  or any other protein modifications  are detected  by specific probes.

== Far-Eastern Blotting ==

Analyses lines  separated by  high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC).  Further analysis is prepared by  being transferred form the HPTLC plate to a PVDF then   by either performing enzymatic or ligand assays or mass spectrometry. A disadvantage to this procedure is the amount of downtime present in being able to prepare both a chromatography and a western blotting continuously since both require post experimental readings which have to be prepared separately.

Far-eastern blotting allows for the following techniques:
	■	Purification of glycosphingolipids and phospholipids.
	■	Structural analysis of lipids in conjunction with direct mass spectrometry.
	■	Binding study using various ligands such as antibodies, lectins, bacterium, viruses, and toxins, and
	■	Enzyme reaction on membranes.

==Additional information==

• In addition, it is important to know that in most cases, the blot is a nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene membrane, which is mobile when submersed in gel and electrical current is applied. In order for the proteins to move along the gel, the proteins must be soluble. A lysis buffer is needed to accomplish this. (Reference: www.abcam.com/ps/pdf/protocols/WB-beginner.pdf).

• Western Blotting is used in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test.  A blot is used to detect anti-HIV antibody in a human blood sample.  The cells that have been infected by HIV have their proteins separated and blotted on the membrane.  The human blood sample is then applied in the antibody incubation step and the free antibody is washed away, followed by a secondary anti-human antibody is added.  After x-ray analysis, the bands that are stained show which proteins the person's blood contains antibodies to.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

The First Law of Thermodynamics is an expression of the principle of the conservation of energy. It states that the total energy of a system and its surroundings is constant, and energy can be transformed, but may not be created or destroyed. 

The First Law can be applied to living organisms by thinking of them as a system. A system cannot output more energy than it contains without an external source of more energy. Once the potential energy locked in carbohydrates and other energy sources are converted into kinetic energy (energy in use or motion) by the organism, the organism will not obtain more  until energy is imputed again. This is important to understand since the variety of tasks that are performed by cells, ribosomes, proteins, etc. are only possible through the intake and transformation of pre-assembled molecules into energy. 

The general equation that describes this theory is:


&lt;math&gt;dU=\delta Q-\delta W\,&lt;/math&gt;        


where &lt;b&gt;dU&lt;/b&gt; is the change in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_energy internal energy], &lt;b&gt;dq&lt;/b&gt; is the infinitesimal heat exchanged, and &lt;b&gt;dw&lt;/b&gt; is the infinitesimal work performed. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(thermodynamics) Work] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat heat] are not [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_variable state variables] where as internal energy is. In this equation, it is demonstrated that only heat and work can lead to a change in the internal energy of a system, which is defined as the total of all kinetic and potential energy of everything within a closed system. This equation may also be described in words as: although energy assumes many forms, the total quantity of energy is constant; and when energy disappears in one form, it appears simultaneously in other forms.

In addition to work and external potential and kinetic energy, the generalization of the law of conservation of mechanical energy was made possible by the recognition of heat and internal energy as forms of energy. As a matter of fact, examples such as surface energy, electrical energy, and magnetic energy can all serve as extensions to the generalization stated above. The validity of this generalization was supported by overwhelming amount of evidence, which has raised its stature to a law of science, known as the First Law of Thermodynamics.

It is important to look at how the internal energy of system changes under constant pressure and temperature conditions because many chemical reactions take place under these specified conditions. Using the definition of the internal energy and assuming that only expansion work is done, one may write:


&lt;math&gt;dU=\delta Q-P*\delta V\, &lt;/math&gt;


Expansion of the terms gives:


'''ΔU = U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - U&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = Q&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; + W = Q&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; - P*ΔV = Q&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; - P*(V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)'''


Finally, rearrangement for Q&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; gives:


'''Q = (U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; -P*V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) - (U&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - P*V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Curry &amp; Webster | year = 1999 | title = Thermodynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans | edition = 1st | publisher = ACADEMIC PRESS | id = 0-12-199570-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Since U, P, and V are all state variables, we may define Q&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, the heat transferred at constant pressure, as a new state function called the enthalpy, H.  We can represent this new state function as:


'''H = U + PV'''


Where H, U, and V are molar or unit-mass values. U denotes the internal energy of a system, P denotes pressure, and V denotes volume.

When heat is added to a system, the internal energy of the system will increase, which, in turn, increases [[Structural Biochemistry/Enthalpy|enthalpy]]. Work done by the surroundings on that system will produce similar (positive work) results. Conversely, heat lost to the surroundings or work done by the system are given a negative sign for enthalpy and work.  In other words, any change in the energy of a system must result in a corresponding change in the surroundings. Therefore, energy is transferred from the system to the surroundings (reset of the universe), or from the surroundings to the system. And thus, energy can neither be created nor destroyed.

The sphere of influence of the process is divided into two parts when the First Law of Thermodynamics is applied to a given process. The region in which the process occurs is set apart as the system; everything with which the system interacts is its surroundings. A system may be of any size; its boundaries may be real or imaginary, rigid or flexible. A system usually consists of a single substance; however, complex systems consist multiple substances may also be found in scientific and engineering applications. In any event, the equations of thermodynamics are written with reference to a well-defined system. Attention is often focused on the particular process of interest and on the equipment and material involved in the process directly. However, the First Law of Thermodynamics applies to the system and its surroundings; not to the system alone.

==Conclusion==
The first law of thermodynamics is that energy can neither be created or destroyed.

General Form
*accumulation = input - output 
*input = rate of energy (potential, kinetic, internal) is inputted into the system + rate of heat entering the system
*output = rate of heat leaving the system + rate at which it leaves as work 
*accumulation = rate of energy in the system

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==

The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved, however, it only describes the transformations observed, and it doesn’t impose any restriction on the process direction. Nevertheless, such a restriction has been observed and proved to be exited in all thermodynamic applications. The need of a law describing this phenomenon gives rise to the second law of thermodynamics.

The &lt;b&gt;Second Law of Thermodynamics&lt;/b&gt; states that the entropy of a closed system is constantly increasing with respect to time. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Levine| first = Ira N. | year = 2005 | title = Physical Chemistry| edition = 6th Ed. | publisher = McGraw Hill Publishing Company| id = ISBN0-0-07-049508-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It is often said jokingly that the first law states that one cannot win and that the second law states that one cannot even break even. 

The second law of thermodynamics may be expressed in two related statements as follows:

Statement 1: It is impossible to operate a system in such a way that heat absorbed by the system is completely converted into work done by the system.

Statement 2: It is impossible for a process to consist solely in the transfer of heat from one temperature level to a higher one.

Statement 1 is not contradictory to the first law of thermodynamics. Statement 1 does not imply that heat cannot be converted to work done by the system; it only implies that either the system or the surroundings have to be changed or modified when such a process takes place. As a corollary, any continuous production of work from heat is proved to be impossible. To compress the gas back to its initial state, energy must be drawn from the surroundings in the form of work; heat is transferred to the surroundings to maintain constant temperature at the same time. The amount of work gained from expansion is required by the reverse process described above, thus the production of net work is impossible.

[[File:Heat Conversion to Work.png|thumb|Heat Conversion to Work]]

A thermodynamic theorem, the Carnot’s theorem is generated based on statement 2. The Carnot’s theorem states that no engine can have a higher thermal efficiency than that of a Carnot engine. Since a Carnot engine is reversible, it is able to transfer heat form one temperature level to a higher one. Although such an engine does not exist in the real world, it is the most efficient engine based on the laws of thermodynamics.

The study of heat engines, devices that are able to convert heat to work in a cyclical fashion, often serves as the classical approach to the second law. This macroscopic viewpoint of properties was able to be conducted without any knowledge of either the structure or the behavior of molecules. Any heat engines consist the following cycles: absorption of heat into the system at a relatively high temperature, rejection of heat to the surroundings at a relatively low temperature, and production of work. The two temperature levels are often referred to as heat reservoirs; the higher temperature level as the hot reservoir, and the lower temperature level as the cold reservoir. In thermodynamic applications, the working fluid, a liquid or a gas, connects the hot and the cold reservoirs in the sense that it absorbs heat from the hot reservoir, produces work, discards heat to the cold reservoir, and returns to its initial state to get ready for a new cycle.

== '''Spontaneous Processes and Entropy''' ==


Some processes proceed spontaneously in one direction, but not in the other. This process is similar to a gas diffusing to fill its container, but never really collecting at one end. These processes are said to be ''spontaneous''; in other words, they ''occur without outside intervention''.

[[Structural Biochemistry/Entropy|'''Entropy''']], denoted by the symbol '''S''', is the thermodynamic property that describes the spontaneity of a process. It is a macroscopic property of randomness or disorder, and is also a function that describes the number of arrangements (positions and/or energy levels) that are available to a system existing in a given state.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics can be explained with a simple example. Consider throwing a deck of ordered playing cards into the air and picking them all up at random. It is very improbable to pick up the cards in their original order because the probability for this to happen is so minute that we never really observe it. Entropy can be closely associated with &lt;b&gt;probability&lt;/b&gt;. The more ways a particular state can be achieved, the greater the likelihood (probability) of finding that state. However, this does &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; mean that it is &lt;b&gt;impossible&lt;/b&gt; for the cards to be put back in their original order or for the gas to be only at one end of the container. It merely is &lt;b&gt;improbable&lt;/b&gt;. 

There is a natural &lt;b&gt;tendency&lt;/b&gt; toward disorder in closed systems because the state that has the highest probability of existing is where the system will be at equilibrium. The equilibrium state, such as within a container of gas, is referred to as the disordered state (where gas molecules are equally dispersed). The equilibrium state is the same as the disordered state because the gas molecules will occupy the largest volume possible, meaning they are all equally spaced out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Levine| first = Ira N. | year = 2005 | title = Physical Chemistry| edition = 6th Ed. | publisher = McGraw Hill Publishing Company| id = ISBN0-0-07-049508-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;



The change in entropy of the universe can be represented as

&lt;font size ='4'&gt;&lt;b&gt;ΔS&lt;sub&gt;univ&lt;/sub&gt;=ΔS&lt;sub&gt;sys&lt;/sub&gt;+ΔS&lt;sub&gt;surr&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

where ΔS&lt;sub&gt;sys&lt;/sub&gt; and  ΔS&lt;sub&gt;surr&lt;/sub&gt; represents the changes in entropy that occur in the system and the surrounding respectively.

If ΔS&lt;sub&gt;univ&lt;/sub&gt; is &lt;B&gt;positive&lt;/b&gt;, the entropy of the system &lt;b&gt;increases&lt;/b&gt;, and the process is spontaneous in the direction written. A &lt;b&gt;negative&lt;/b&gt; value for ΔS&lt;sub&gt;univ&lt;/sub&gt; indicates that the process is spontaneous in the &lt;b&gt;opposite&lt;/b&gt; direction. The system is at equilibrium, and the process has no tendency to occur if ΔS&lt;sub&gt;univ&lt;/ser ub&gt; is equal to zero.

&lt;big&gt;In some cases, particularly biological systems, it is hard to see how the entropy of universe is increasing. For example, when a leaf use carbon dioxide and nutrients to produce cellulose, the randomness and consequently entropy is decreasing. However, this process does not have any contradiction with second law of thermodynamic because it accompanies with increasing heat in the environment which increases the entropy.&lt;/big&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berg| first = Jeremy M. | year = 2010 | title = Biochemistry| edition = 7th Ed. | publisher = W. H. Freeman and Company| id = ISBN0-1-42-922936-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entropy has to do with the freedom of particle motion. As a result, when entropy increases in the system, it can cause a phase change from solid state to liquid state, and even to the gas state. In the solid state, the particles' movements are restricted and they have less freedom to move around in a fixed area. However, in a liquid state, particles have more freedom to move around. Therefore, in a gas state, the particles have so much greater freedom to move around. Consequently, entropy increases as one goes solid to liquid and to gas state. 

When such disorder occurs, the energy of motion becomes more dispersed. For instance,when a salt is dissolved in liquid water, there would be more ions and solvent molecules interacting with each other. As a result, the solution's energy of motion is more dispersed. The greater the freedom the particles have, the more energy of motion they would dispersed. 
                                 solid ---&gt; liquid ----&gt; gas
 less freedom for particles interaction --------&gt; much greater freedom for particles interaction
                 fixed energy of motion --------&gt; dispersed energy of motion
Therefore, the change in phase states and the freedom of motion of particles can help to determine whether a reaction is spontaneous or not.

&lt;ref&gt;Silberberg, Martin S.(2010). Principles of General Chemistry (2nd Edition).McGraw Hill Publishing Company. ISBN978-0-07-351108-05&lt;/ref&gt;==='''The number of Microstates and Entropy''' ===

As stated in the previous section about the freedom of motion and the dispersed energy of motion, they are the two factors that can determine the direction of the spontaneous reaction. Silberberg defines microstates as &quot;the quantized states of the whole system of a gas molecules&quot;. Microstates is about a gas molecules' state when it reacts with other molecules in the system. Consequently, there would be an increase in the energy of motion because the molecules vibrate and rotate around one another. In addition, there are different microstates for different conditions in the system. In thermodynamic terms, microstates can be related to entropy, the state of disorder, because the number of microstates is the number of ways that the thermal energy can be dispersed in the system. The equation is
                                        S= k ln W
      k (the Boltzmann constant)= R (gas constant)/ Avogadro's number= 1.38 x 10^ -23 J/K
      W= the number of microstates
      S is entropy
Therefore, entropy depends on the number of microstates.
            small number of microstates -----&gt; much greater number of microstates
                            low entropy -----&gt; high entropy

==='''The Effect of Temperature on Spontaneity''' ===


[[Structural Biochemistry/Entropy|Entropy]] changes in the surroundings ΔS&lt;sub&gt;surr&lt;/sub&gt; are primarily determined by heat flow. 

''The sign of ΔS&lt;sub&gt;surr&lt;/sub&gt; depends on the direction of the heat flow.''
In an exothermic process, the resulting energy flow increases the random motions in the surroundings, increasing the [[Structural Biochemistry/Entropy|entropy]] of the surroundings (ΔS&lt;sub&gt;surr&lt;/sub&gt; is positive). Similarly, the tendency for systems to undergo changes that lower its energy can be explained by the fact that when a system at constant temperature moves to a lower energy state, the energy it gives up is transferred to the surroundings, leading to an increase in entropy there. 

''The magnitude of ΔS&lt;sub&gt;surr&lt;/sub&gt; depends on the temperature.''
At high temperatures, atoms in the surroundings are in rapid motion. A given quantity of energy transferred to the surroundings do not make a large percent change in their motions. Thus, the impact of the transfer of a given quantity of energy as heat to or from the surroundings is greater at lower temperatures, where the randomness of the surroundings experience a greater percent change. 
In other words, ΔS&lt;sub&gt;surr&lt;/sub&gt; depends directly on the quantity of heat transferred and inversely on temperature.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Entropy (S) is the thermodynamic measure of randomness throughout a system (also simplified as “disorder”). Entropy can also be described as thermal energy not able to do work since energy becomes more evenly distributed as the system becomes more disordered. Entropy is particularly important when describing how energy is used and transferred within a system. As an exact value of entropy is impossible to measure; however, through relationships derived by both Josiah Willard Gibbs and James Clerk Maxwell the change in energy between one state and another can be calculated based on measurable functions, like temperature and pressure. That value in turn gives insight into how chemical reactions are favored and, most importantly, allows for the calculation of Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG = ΔH-TΔS). 

Using statistical mechanics of the gas phase, entropy can be estimated by
using Boltzmann’s formula. According to the formula, S = k ln W where k, the Boltzmann's constant, equals 1.381 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−23&lt;/sup&gt; (in J/K). The Boltzman's constant was calculated by relating to the gas constant R = kNA. W stands for the number of ways that the atoms or molecules in the sample can be arranged while still containing the same total energy.

It is important to note that the change in entropy, like temperature and volume, is a state function: the value is independent of the path used to get from the original state to the final state.  Additionally the overall change in entropy of the universe is positive, meaning that the universe is continuously moving to a state of higher disorder.

A simple example where entropy is increased is when ice melts to water. The structure of ice is a well-ordered, crystalline system. When energy is put into the system in the form of heat, molecules begin to move more rapidly and no longer have the neatly ordered structure of ice. Thus, there distribution throughout space is more “random”. Another example where entropy is increased is when a reaction produces more moles of products than the reactants in the same phase.

The favorability of intramolecular reactions over intermolecular reactions is explained entropically.  In an intermolecular coupling, two molecules come together to form one thus increasing the order in the system and decreasing the entropy.  In an intramolecular reaction there is one molecule to start and one at the end which does not change the entropy of the system in an unfavorable way as is seen in intermolecular reactions.

Entropy can further be divided into thermal disorder, in which the entropy increases as heat is added to the system, and positional disorder, which related to the increase in entropy as the volume of the system is increased.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, Chemical Principles The Quest for insight, Fourth Edition&lt;/ref&gt; 

Entropy is also of particular interest in biochemistry as one of the unofficial definitions of life is an aggregate of molecules that work to decrease entropy in a certain localized area or volume. Additionally, it helps describe many phenomenons found in biochemical systems, which are described next. 

==Entropy in Biochemical Interactions==
Entropy is a measure of the unavailable energy in a closed thermodynamic system that is also usually considered to be a measure of the system's disorder, that is a property of the system's state. It is varies directly with any reversible change in heat in the system and inverserly with the temperature of the system. 

Entropy can be a strong driving force in nature. For example, it plays a very large part in the behavior of [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrophobic interaction|hydrophobic]] substances in water. A very common example of entropy at work would be lipids in solution. The lack of polarity in longer hydrocarbon chains tends to &quot;force&quot; water molecules to align themselves in an orderly pattern around the saturated part of the molecule. This orderly pattern decreases entropy as it prevents water from freely associating itself with other water molecules via [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrogen bonds|hydrogen bonding]]. An increase in entropy would lead to a more negative [[Structural Biochemistry/Free energy|Gibbs Free Energy]], and a spontaneous reaction. The saturating effect of decreasing the change in entropy serves as the driving force for lipids to associate with one another instead of with water. Lipids coalesce to reduce the amount of water surrounding its molecules, and thereby increasing entropy. This phenomenon results in the formation of essential evolutionary components of life, such as lipid bilayer structures such as the  [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Lipid Bilayer|lipid bilayer membrane]]in eukaryotic cells. 

Another place that the entropic favoring of [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrophobic interaction|hydrophobic]] molecules to dissociate with water can be found is in the active sites of [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzymes]]. Many enzymes have a high concentration of hydrophobic residues in their active sites. The binding of an enzyme to its substrate alleviates the lack of entropy by driving water molecules out of the active site.

The value of understanding entropy’s role in chemistry can be utilized in the lab.  For example, ammonium sulfate can be added in high concentrations to an aqueous solution containing at least one or more [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]].  Proteins are much larger than ammonium sulfate ions. Thus the condensed charge of the newly dissolved salt attracts the water molecules in solution to form hydrate shells around them.  In order to form these shells around ammonium sulfate, water molecules from the hydration shells around proteins must be used.  The hydration shells of proteins are generally more ordered since not all of the protein surface is charged nor are the charges as condensed. Thus, the decrease in water molecules around proteins reaches a limit where the proteins become insoluble in water and are precipitated out for isolation and further study.  .&lt;ref&gt;Whitford, Proteins: Structure and function, Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, entropy can also play a negative role in biochemistry.&lt;br&gt;
For example, denatured protein by heating is an example where entropy plays a role in denaturation.
In a folded protein, entropy is high due to its packed structure. As the protein becomes unfolded(denatured), the hydrophobic regions in a protein are surrounded by water.
Overall there is no change in entropy but the protein becomes denatured.

Oil spill in sea also follows the same argument.

==Entropy during phase changes==
[[File:Entropy.png|thumb|An entropy diagram for phase changes of water]]

As mentioned earlier, entropy is the measure of disorder, and this is also the case when it comes to phase changes. 

This could be thought of a more simplified manner. For example, in the solid form of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, they are in a very rigid and ordered crystal structure. As the temperature is raised, the rigid crystal structures begin to loosen up from its tight grasp of one another(via hydrogen bonds), and eventually, melting occurs. The ice turns into liquid. There was an increase in the disorder of this system, it went from a solid rigid crystal structure, to a bunch of freely moving molecules. This amount of disorder for this phase change to occur is entropy, specifically in the case of melting, the entropy of fusion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==History of Development==
The enthalpy of reaction at specific values of T and P is defined as the heat exchanged between the system and the surroundings as the reactants are transformed into products at conditions of constant T and P. The heat flowing into the system is given a positive sign. Also, the standard enthalpy of formation refers to one mole of the specified reaction at a presssure of 1 bar. 
The term &quot;enthalpy&quot; and its accurate definition did not come about until the late 1840s. Before then, scientists and engineers knew from experience that a fluid called heat transfers from a hotter object to a cooler object when they are brought into contact. The result is that the cold object becomes warmer, and the hot object becomes cooler as heat transfers between them. 
Enthalpy is also the heat energy that absorbed or released as the reactants and they become the products at a constant pressure. When enthalpy is negative, the heat energy is released. However, when enthalpy is positive, the reactants absorb the heat from their surroundings. 

A reasonable view is that there is something transferred from the hot object to the cold one. This “something” was referred as heat. Thus, it was convenient to say that heat always flows from higher temperature to lower one. This conclusion established the concept of temperature gradient, which may be viewed as the driving force for the transfer of energy as heat. Later, through conducting more precise measurements and experiments, scientists concluded that the rate of heat transfer from one object to another is proportional to the temperature difference between the two objects. Thus, the heat transfer is negligible when the temperature differences between the two objects are negligible.

==A Thermodynamic View of Heat==

Heat, or energy transferred between a hot and a cold object, is never regarded as being stored with an object from the thermodynamic point of view. Form this view point, heat is defined to exist only as energy is in transit from one object to another; or in the thermodynamic terminology, from the system to the surroundings. When heat is added or subtracted from a system or its surroundings, it is thought that energy is not stored in or being pulled away from the point of contact. Rather, heat is thought to act as kinetic and potential energy. The addition and subtraction processes are considered to be the transfer from potential energy to kinetic energy, and vice versa.

==Relationship between Heat and Enthalpy==

In spite of the transient nature of heat, the definition of heat is always viewed as a unique property of the object that is being measured. As mentioned above, temperature changes were used as the primary units to measure heat until the late 1840s. In fact, the definition of the unit of heat was based on the temperature change of a unit mass of water, as seen in the British thermal unit. The British thermal unit is commonly known as the Btu. 

The British thermal unit is defined as 1/180th quantity of heat which when transferred to one kilogram mass of water raised its temperature from 0 to 100 degree Celsius at standard atmospheric pressure. This primitive definition of heat failed to provide an accurate measurement. The main reason accounts for this inaccuracy lie in the reference object, which in this case is water. The measure temperature change is partially determined by the purity of the water. The purer the water is, the more amount of heat is need for the temperature to increase by one unit. 

In the twentieth century, more and more scientists realized that heat is just another form of energy that is being transferred by making contact of two objects. Thus it is convenient and practical to measure heat by using an energy unit. 

==The Modern Concept of Enthalpy==

The modern concept of enthalpy or heat was developed largely based on the series of experiments carried out by James P. Joule (1818–1889). Joule’s experiment involves carefully measured amounts of water, oil, and mercury in an insulated container. He placed known amounts of these afore mentioned substances in the container, and agitated the fluids with a rotating stirrer. The mechanical work needed to carry out the rotation was carefully calculated, and the temperature changes of the fluid temperatures were accurately measured. In his result, Joule stated that for each fluid that a fixed amount of work was required per unit mass for every degree of temperature rise caused by the mechanical work provided. Furthermore, the original temperature of the fluids could be restored by the transfer of heat through contact as simple as to cooler objects. The quantitative relationship between heat and work was thus firmly established by Joule’s experiment, which proved definitively that heat is a form of energy.

In order to give heat a more concrete definition and moreover, to recognize a common basis for all energy units, international steam table calorie is defined in relation to joule, the SI unit of energy. Joule is the mechanical work done when a force of one Newton acts through a distance of one meter. Upon the establishment of the SI unit, the international steam table calorie was defined as equivalent to 4.1868 Joule (exact, by definition) and thermochemical calorie is equivalent to 4.184 Joule (exact, by definition). As a reference, one international steam table Btu is equivalent to 1055.056 Joule, and one thermochemical Btu is equivalent to 1054.35 Joule. 

==Mathematical Expression of Enthalpy==

Enthalpy(H) is a measure of the heat energy of a reaction. The Enthalpy H of a thermodynamic system whose internal energy, pressure, and volume are U, P, and V is defined as H =U+PV Since U, P, and V are state functions, H is a state function. note from dw=-PdV that the product of P and V has the dimensions of work and hence of energy. Therefore it is legitimate to add U and PV. Naturally, H has units of energy. 

For example, a reaction that is [[Structural Biochemistry/Exergonic reaction|exothermic]] with have a negative change in enthalpy. This is because the enthalpy of the products is less that that of the reactants.

[[Image:Water enthalpy formation.JPG|right|231px|The enthalpy of water formation.]]

In mathematical terms enthalpy of a reaction can be known as the following: 

ΔH = (sums of bonds broken) - (sums of bonds formed)
 
ΔH = ΣnH&lt;sub&gt;products&lt;/sub&gt; - ΣnH&lt;sub&gt;reactants&lt;/sub&gt;

When ΔH is negative then the reaction is [[Structural Biochemistry/Exergonic reaction|exothermic]] and more bonds are formed than broken. 

If ΔH is positive then the reaction is [[Structural Biochemistry/Endergonic reaction|endothermic]]. Chemical bonds tend to form spontaneously that the negative value of ΔH represents exothermic reaction.

The enthalpy for the reverse reaction is equal in magnitude, but opposite in mathematical sign.

Enthalpy is a state function and thus according to Hess's Law, the overall enthalpy of the reaction is equal to the sum of the enthalpies of the individual reactions or steps for which the overall reaction can be divided.

Since enthalpy is a function defined for the sake of calculations, it is difficult to measure the actual enthalpy of a substance. The change in enthalpy however, is easily measured and is an important quantity in many calculations.

When enthalpy changes, it signifies there is a change of state happening in the system. But enthalpies are reversible in the sense that the physical state changes are usually reversible. Therefore, since the enthalpy for formation of everything is always given, then at any given change, the new enthalpy can be calculated.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bioenergetics''' refers to the transformation of energy that occurs within living organisms.   In order to fuel the chemical mechanisms within cells, organisms require an input of energy.  This energy is used to drive chemical reactions and help store and process information, which is essential in propagating life.  Energy may be obtained from sunlight, in which the organisms are referred to as '''phototrophs''', or it may be extracted from chemicals, in which the organisms are referred to as '''chemotrophs'''.  Because energy may not be available at all times to fuel these life processes, organisms have adapted mechanisms to couple chemical reactions  so that exergonic reactions can provide energy for those that are endorgernic.

The chemical reactions performed by an organism make up its '''metabolism'''.  '''Catabolic reactions''' involve the break down of chemical molecules, while '''anabolic reactions''' involve the synthesis of compounds.

== The Laws of Thermodynamics ==

The energy processes in living organisms are defined by the basic laws of [[Structural Biochemistry/Thermodynamics|thermodynamics]].  The [[Structural Biochemistry/First law|first law]] dictates that the total energy present in the universe always remains constant (Note: though the energy total is static, it often changes forms such as when an animal converts the chemical energy of food to mechanical energy as it moves).  Meanwhile, the [[Structural Biochemistry/Second law|second law]] asserts that the total [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry/Entropy entropy] present in the universe is ever increasing.

== The Energy Process ==

For phototrophs, sunlight takes the form of potential energy, while complex molecules serve as potential energy for chemotrophs. In living organisms, energy is commonly used in the form of work. This work energy is acquired by breaking weak bonds and forming stronger bonds. Work may take the form of synthetic chemical reactions, maintaining chemical and ionic gradients (homeostasis), and transferring genetic information.  This most important form of work is the polymerization of information-containing macromolecules, such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]], and [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA|RNA]].  These macromolecules form the basis of life and are what ultimately drive life’s processes.  Though mechanisms have been adapted to make the most efficient use of the acquired energy, some of it is inevitably released in the form of heat or metabolic waste products.  These waste products can be eliminated from the body of an organism and consumed by bacteria or other organisms that are able to extract energy from them.  Often, materials and compounds useless to one organism are energy sources for another and by this exchange energy is constantly recycled.

== Energy Coupling ==

In order to increase energetic efficiency, cells often couple reactions together.  [[Structural Biochemistry/Endergonic reaction|'''Endergonic''' reactions]] are those that require an input of energy.  [[Structural Biochemistry/Exergonic reaction|'''Exergonic''' reactions]] are those that release energy.  By coupling these two reactions together, the overall chemical process is made exergonic so it can occur spontaneously due to a negative free-energy change.  Using this process, unfavorable chemical reactions can be made to proceed.

The basis of reaction coupling is a shared chemical intermediate.  After one reaction produces one product, another can use it as a reactant to drive the production of an essential compound.

=== Gibbs Free Energy ===

Named after Josiah Willard Gibbs who developed the concept in 1878, the Gibbs [[Structural Biochemistry/Free energy|free energy]] describes the overall favorability of a reaction to proceed.  It is characterized by the following equation: ΔG = ΔH - TΔS where ΔG is the Gibbs free energy change, ΔH is the change in [[Structural Biochemistry/Enthalpy|enthalpy]] (heat), T is temperature (measured in Kelvins), and ΔS is the change in [[Structural Biochemistry/Entropy|entropy]].  A reaction, or process, will occur spontaneously if and only if ΔG &lt; 0 for that reaction.  If ΔG &gt; 0 then that reaction must be coupled (see Energy Coupling) with a reaction which has ΔG &lt; 0 such that the overall ΔG of the 2 reactions is &lt;0.  ATP hydrolysis is a commonly used reaction for such situations (see ATP).  As the equation shows, a reaction is more favorable, the more ΔH &lt; 0 (i.e. the more heat is given off by the reaction) and the more ΔS &gt; 0 (i.e. the more disorder is increased) and the effect of entropy gained or lost is magnified by the temperature surrounding the reaction.

=== ATP ===
[[Image:Adenosintriphosphat.svg‎|thumbnail|Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)]]

Most coupling reactions use the break down of '''adenosine triphosphate (ATP)''' as the intermediate process to drive chemical synthesis.  ATP is used as an energy-storing compound.  The phosphoanhydride bond between phosphate groups found in ATP stores a significant amount of energy due to the negative charges carried by the phosphate groups. This bond stored energy that is not currently use, but available later for running reactions is called Potential energy. This energy is required to keep the negatively charged groups close to each other in the ATP molecule because they, as do all like-charged groups, repel each other.  This energy can be released (Exothermic reaction) for use in the cell to do work, move things and build things by hydrolysis and breakage of the bond. 

'''ATP -&gt; ADP + P + Energy'''

When carbohydrates and other foods are consumed, they are broken down by enzymes to release the energy within them. The exothermic energy released is used to reattach a phosphate to ADP through Endothermic reactions which will regenerate ATP formation.

'''ADP + P + Energy -&gt; ATP'''

Then, the process of bond breaking and bond forming will repeat over and over within human cells to provide energy for all the chemical reactions.

=== GTP ===
[[Image:GTP chemical structure.png‎|thumbnail|Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP)]]

'''GTP''' (guanosine-5’-triphosphate) can be used as a source of energy, just like ATP but not in any type of organisms.  However GTP is only used in specific areas of the cell, namely protein synthesis.  ATP and GTP are similar in structure; both have a purine base, and 3 phosphate groups, but ATP has adenine attached to the purine, whereas GTP has a guanine.  The energy stored in GTP is released in the same way as ATP.

==Feedback==

In order for the body to maintain homeostasis, '''feedback''' loops are often used. '''Negative feedback''' maintains homeostasis by slowing down or stopping a mechanism once it approaches the appropriate range. For instance, the hydrolysis of ATP is an [[Structural Biochemistry/Exergonic reaction|exergonic reaction]], meaning it gives off energy in the form of heat. If the temperature in a cell becomes too high, the cell will die, so negative feedback will stop the reaction to maintain homeostasis in terms of temperature. In '''positive feedback''', a process will speed up once a receptor detects the occurrence of a certain reaction. A positive feedback mechanism is used in the stomach during digestion: for example, HCl secreted by parietal cells in the stomach convert pepsinogen to pepsin, and this reaction causes the pepsin to convert all the pepsinogen to pepsin to aid in the enzymatic breakdown of proteins. Another example of a positive feedback mechanism is childbirth, once the contractions start, they begin to occur with increasing frequency and pressure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:H-R diagram.svg|thumb|270px|A Hertzsprung-Russell diagram plots the actual brightness (or [[absolute magnitude]]) of a star against its [[color index]] (represented as B-V). The main sequence is visible as a prominent diagonal band that runs from the upper left to the lower right.]]

The '''main sequence''' is the name for a continuous and distinctive band of stars that appear on a plot of stellar [[Color index|color]] versus brightness. These color-[[absolute magnitude|magnitude]] plots are known as [[Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]]s after their co-developers, [[Ejnar Hertzsprung]] and [[Henry Norris Russell]]. Stars on this band are known as '''main-sequence stars''' or '''dwarf stars'''.

After a star has formed, it generates energy at the hot, dense core region through the [[nuclear fusion]] of [[hydrogen]] atoms into [[helium]]. During this stage of the star's lifetime, it is located along the main sequence at a position determined primarily by its mass, but also based upon its chemical composition and other factors. In general, the more massive the star the shorter its lifespan on the main sequence. After the hydrogen fuel at the core has been consumed, the star evolves away from the main sequence.

The main sequence is sometimes divided into upper and lower parts, based on the processes that stars use to generate energy. Stars below about 1.5 times the [[Solar mass|mass of the Sun]] (or 1.5 solar masses) fuse hydrogen atoms together in a series of stages to form helium; a sequence called the [[proton-proton chain]]. Above this mass, in the upper main sequence, the nuclear fusion process can instead use atoms of [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] as intermediaries in the production of helium from hydrogen atoms.

Because there is a temperature gradient between the core of a star and its surface, energy is steadily transported upward through the intervening layers until it is radiated away at the [[photosphere]]. The two mechanisms used to carry this energy through the star are [[radiation]] and [[convection]], with the type used depending on the local conditions. Convection tends to occur in regions with steeper temperature gradients, higher opacity or both. When convection occurs in the core region it acts to stir up the helium ashes, thus maintaining the proportion of fuel needed for fusion to occur.

== History ==

In the early part of the twentieth century, information about the types and distances of [[star]]s became more readily available. The [[spectra]] of stars were shown to have distinctive features, which allowed them to be categorized. [[Annie Jump Cannon]] and [[Edward C. Pickering]] at [[Harvard College Observatory]] had developed a method of categorization that became known as the Harvard classification scheme. This scheme was published in the ''Harvard Annals'' in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In [[Potsdam]] in 1906, the Danish astronomer [[Ejnar Hertzsprung]] noticed that the reddest stars—classified as K and M in the Harvard scheme—could be divided into two distinct groups. These stars are either much brighter than the Sun, or much fainter. To distinguish these groups, he called them &quot;giant&quot; and &quot;dwarf&quot; stars. The following year he began studying [[star cluster]]s; large groupings of stars that are co-located at approximately the same distance. He published the first plots of color versus luminosity for these stars. These plots showed a prominent and continuous sequence of stars, which he named the main sequence.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite book

At [[Princeton University]], [[Henry Norris Russell]] was following a similar course of research. He was studying the relationship between the spectral classification of stars and their actual brightness as corrected for distance—their [[absolute magnitude]]. For this purpose he used a set of stars that had reliable parallaxes and many of which had been categorized at Harvard. When he plotted the spectral types of these stars against their absolute magnitude, he found that dwarf stars followed a distinct relationship. This allowed the real brightness of a dwarf star to be predicted with reasonable accuracy.&lt;ref name=obs36&gt;{{cite journal

 | accessdate=2007-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the red stars observed by Hertzsprung, the dwarf stars also followed the spectra-luminosity relationship discovered by Russell. However, the giant stars are much brighter than dwarfs and so do not follow the same relationship. Russell proposed that the &quot;giant stars must have low density or great surface-brightness, and the reverse is true of dwarf stars&quot;. The same curve also showed that there were very few faint white stars.&lt;ref name=obs36/&gt;

In 1933, [[Bengt Strömgren]] introduced the term Hertzsprung-Russell diagram to denote a luminosity-spectral class diagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | accessdate=2008-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This name reflected the parallel development of this technique by both Hertzsprung and Russell earlier in the century.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;

As evolutionary models of stars were developed during the 1930s, it was shown that, for stars of a uniform chemical composition, a relationship exists between a star's mass, composition, luminosity and radius. That is, the radius and luminosity of a star can be calculated given its mass and composition. This became known as the [[Vogt-Russell theorem]]; named after Heinrich Vogt and Henry Norris Russell. By this theorem, once a star's chemical composition and its position on the main sequence is known, so too is the star's mass and radius. (However, it was subsequently discovered that the theorem breaks down somewhat for stars of non-uniform composition.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Image:Dwarf Stars.png|right|thumb|280px|The spectral types of main sequence stars, with mass increasing from right to left.]]
A refined scheme for [[stellar classification]] was published in 1943 by W. W. Morgan and P. C. Keenan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

For historical reasons, the [[spectral type]]s of stars followed, in order of decreasing temperature with colors ranging from blue to red, the sequence O, B, A, F, G, K and M. (A popular [[mnemonic]] for memorizing this sequence of stellar classes is &quot;Oh Be A Fine Girl/Guy, Kiss Me&quot;.) The luminosity class ranged from I to V, in order of decreasing luminosity. Stars of luminosity class V belonged to the main sequence.&lt;ref name=tnc&gt;{{cite book

== Characteristics ==
Main sequence stars have been extensively studied through stellar models, allowing their formation and evolutionary history to be relatively well understood. The position of the star on the main sequence provides information about its physical properties.

The [[temperature]] of a star can be approximately determined by treating it as an idealized energy radiator known as a [[black body]]. In this case, the luminosity ''L'' and radius ''R'' are related to the temperature ''T'' by the [[Stefan-Boltzmann Law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;L = 4\pi \sigma R^2 T^4&lt;/math&gt;

where ''σ'' is the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]]. The temperature and composition of a star's [[photosphere]] determines the energy emission at different wavelengths. The [[color index]], or ''B''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''V'', measures the difference in this energy emission by means of filters that capture the star's [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] in blue (''B'') and green-yellow (''V'') light. (By measuring the difference between these values, this eliminates the need to correct the magnitudes for distance.) Thus the position of a star on the HR diagram can be used to estimate its radius and temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By modifying the physical properties of the [[plasma]] in the photosphere, the temperature of a star also determines its [[spectral type]].

=== Formation ===
When a [[protostar]] is formed from the collapse of a [[giant molecular cloud]] of gas and dust in the local [[interstellar medium]], the initial composition is homogeneous throughout, consisting of about 70% hydrogen, 28% helium and trace amounts of other elements, by mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the initial collapse, this [[pre-main sequence star]] generates energy through gravitational contraction. Upon reaching a suitable density, energy generation is begun at the core using an exothermic [[nuclear fusion]] process that converts hydrogen into helium.&lt;ref name=tnc/&gt;

A star remains near its initial position on the main sequence until a significant amount of hydrogen in the core has been consumed, then begins to evolve into a more luminous star. (On the HR diagram, the evolving star moves up and to the right of the main sequence.) Thus the main sequence represents the primary hydrogen-burning stage of a star's lifetime.&lt;ref name=tnc/&gt;

The majority of stars on a typical HR diagram lie along the main sequence curve. This line is so pronounced because both the [[stellar classification|spectral type]] and the [[luminosity]] depend only on a star's mass, at least to [[zeroth order approximation]], as long as it is fusing hydrogen at its core—and that is what almost all stars spend most of their &quot;active&quot; life doing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Energy generation ===
[[Image:PPvsCNO.png|right|280px|thumb|This graph shows the relative energy output for the [[Proton-proton chain reaction|proton-proton]] (PP), [[CNO cycle|CNO]] and [[Triple-alpha process|triple-α ]] fusion processes at different temperatures. At the Sun's core temperature, the PP process is more efficient.]]
All main sequence stars have a core region where energy is generated by nuclear fusion. The temperature and density of this core are at the levels necessary to sustain the energy production that will support the remainder of the star. A reduction of energy production would cause the overlaying mass to compress the core, resulting in an increase in the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure. Likewise an increase in energy production would cause the star to expand, lowering the pressure at the core. Thus the star forms a self-regulating system in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime.&lt;ref name=brainerd&gt;{{cite web

Astronomers divide the main sequence into upper and lower parts, based on the dominant type of fusion process at the core. Stars in the upper main sequence have sufficient mass to use the [[CNO cycle]] to fuse hydrogen into helium. This process uses atoms of [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] as intermediaries in the fusion process. In the lower main sequence, energy is generated as the result of the [[proton-proton chain]], which directly fuses hydrogen together in a series of stages to produce helium.&lt;ref name=hannu&gt;{{cite book

At a stellar core temperature of 18 million [[kelvin]]s, both fusion processes are equally efficient. This is the core temperature of a star with 1.5 solar masses. Hence the upper main sequence consists of stars above this mass. The apparent upper limit for a main sequence star is 120-200 solar masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Structure ===

[[Image:Solar internal structure.svg|right|280px|thumb|This diagram shows a cross-section of a Sun-like star, showing the internal structure.]]
 
Because there is a temperature difference between the core and the surface, or [[photosphere]], energy is transported outward. The two modes for transporting this energy are [[radiation]] and [[convection]]. A [[radiation zone]], where energy is transported by [[radiation]], is stable against convection and there is very little mixing of the plasma. By contrast, in a [[convection zone]] the energy is transported by bulk movement of plasma, with hotter material rising and cooler material descending. Convection is a more efficient mode for carrying energy than radiation, but it will only occur under conditions that create a steep temperature gradient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In massive stars, the rate of energy generation by the CNO cycle is very sensitive to temperature, so the fusion is highly concentrated at the core. Consequently, there is a high temperature gradient in the core region, which results in a convection zone for more efficient energy transport.&lt;ref name=hannu/&gt; This mixing of material around the core removes the helium ash from the hydrogen burning region, allowing more of the hydrogen in the star to be consumed during the main sequence lifetime. The outer regions of a massive star transport energy by radiation, with little or no convection.&lt;ref name=brainerd/&gt;

Intermediate mass, class A stars such as [[Sirius]] may transport energy entirely by radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate=2007-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Medium-sized, low mass stars like the Sun have a core region that is stable against convection, with a convection zone near the surface. This produces mixing of the outer layers, but results in a less efficient consumption of the hydrogen in the star. This causes a steady buildup of a helium-rich core, surrounded by a hydrogen-rich outer region. By contrast, cool, low-mass stars are convective throughout. Thus the helium produced at the core is distributed across the star, producing a relatively uniform atmosphere and a proportionately longer main sequence lifespan.&lt;ref name=brainerd/&gt;

=== Luminosity-color variation ===

As non-fusing helium ash accumulates in the core, the reduction in the abundance of hydrogen per unit mass results in a gradual lowering of the fusion rate within that mass. To compensate, the core temperature and pressure slowly increase, which actually causes a net increase in the overall fusion rate (to support the greater density of the inner star). This produces a steady increase in the luminosity and radius of the star over time.&lt;ref name=Clayton/&gt; Thus, for example, the luminosity of the early Sun was only about 70% of its current value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Other factors that broaden the main sequence band on the HR diagram include uncertainty in the distance to the stars, and the presence of unresolved [[binary star]]s that can alter the observed stellar parameters. However, even perfect observation would show a fuzzy main sequence, because mass is not the only parameter that affects a star's color and luminosity.

A nearly vertical region of the HR diagram, known as the [[instability strip]], is occupied by pulsating [[variable star]]s. These stars vary in magnitude at regular intervals, giving them a pulsating appearance. The strip intersects the upper part of the main sequence in the region of class A and F stars; which are between one and two solar masses. However, main sequence stars in this region experience only small variations in magnitude and so are hard to detect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Lifetime ===

The lifespan that a star spends on the main sequence is governed by two factors. The total amount of energy that can be generated through nuclear fusion of hydrogen is limited by the amount of available hydrogen fuel that can be consumed at the core. For a star in equilibrium, the energy generated at the core must be at least equal to the energy radiated at the surface. Since the luminosity gives the amount of energy radiated per unit time, the total life span can be estimated, to first approximation, as the total energy produced divided by the star's luminosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Our [[Sun]] has been a main sequence star for about 4.5 billion years and will continue to be one for another 5.5 billion years, for a total main sequence lifetime of 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; years. After the hydrogen supply in the core is exhausted, it will expand to become a [[red giant]] and fuse [[helium]] atoms to form [[carbon]]. As the energy output of the helium fusion process per unit mass is only about a tenth the energy output of the hydrogen process, this stage will only last for about 10% of a star's total active lifetime. Thus, on average, about 90% of the observed stars will be on the main sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

where ''M'' and ''L'' are the mass and luminosity of the star, respectively, &lt;math&gt;\begin{smallmatrix}M_{\bigodot}\end{smallmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; is a solar mass, &lt;math&gt;\begin{smallmatrix}L_{\bigodot}\end{smallmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[solar luminosity]] and &lt;math&gt;\tau_{ms}&lt;/math&gt; is the star's estimated main sequence lifetime.

The mass-luminosity relationship depends on how efficiently energy can be transported from the core to the surface. A higher [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]] has an insulating effect that retains more energy at the core, so the star does not need to produce as much energy to remain in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. By contrast, a lower opacity means energy escapes more rapidly and the star must burn more fuel to remain in equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Evolutionary tracks ===
Once a main sequence star consumes the hydrogen at its core, the loss of energy generation causes gravitational collapse to resume. The hydrogen surrounding the core reaches sufficient temperature and pressure to undergo fusion, forming a hydrogen-burning shell surrounding a helium core. In consequence of this change, the outer envelope of the star expands and decreases in temperature, turning it into a [[red giant]]. At this point the star is evolving off the main sequence and entering the giant branch. (The path the star now follows across the HR diagram is called an evolutionary track.) The helium core of the star continues to collapse until it is entirely supported by [[electron degeneracy pressure]]—a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] effect that restricts how closely matter can be compacted.

The most massive stars will leave the main sequence first, followed steadily in sequence by stars of ever lower masses.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Energy Coupling ==
[[Image:Free energy.JPG‎‎|thumb|The total ∆G is negative because of the coupling of reactions. In this diagram, ∆G(1) stands for the change in G resulting from the reaction of glucose + Pi --&gt; Glucose 6-phosphate, ∆G(2) is the free energy resulting from the reaction of ATP --&gt; ADP + Pi, and ∆G3 is the total change in free energy by coupling these two reactions together.]]

Many chemicals' reactions are not spontaneous and require energy to occur. The spontaneity of a chemical reaction is determined by its [[Structural Biochemistry/Free energy|Gibbs free energy]] value. If negative, the reaction will proceed spontaneously; if positive, the reaction will not be spontaneous. Note that this is not equivalent to kinetics, or the speed of a reaction; Gibbs free energy only determines the spontaneity of a given reaction. How quickly the reaction proceeds is determined by other factors, such as the presence of enzymes, the amount of heat (energy) that the system has available, and the physical properties of the reacting molecules. 

Spontaneous reactions occur without the need for extra energy, but they may happen slowly. In order to catalyze non-spontaneous reactions, such as the synthesis of macromolecules, enzymes and coupling are used by the cell. Almost all reactions that take place in a cell are catalyzed by [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzymes]] that decrease the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Activation energy|activation energy]] of the reaction. Essentially, this means that the enzyme opens up a more favorable &quot;pathway&quot; for the reaction, allowing it to initiate more easily than before, and with less energy. In addition, an unfavorable reaction can be coupled together with a favorable one to make the overall reaction favorable. For example, Glucose + P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; -&gt; Glucose-6-phosphate has a positive &lt;math&gt;delta&lt;/math&gt; G and is therefore unfavorable. But it can be coupled with ATP -&gt; ADP + P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (which has a negative &lt;math&gt;delta&lt;/math&gt; G) to make the reaction favorable. The overall reaction thus becomes ATP + Glucose -&gt; ADP + Glucose-6-phosphate and has a negative &lt;math&gt;delta&lt;/math&gt; G. Therefore, ATP is considered the energy currency of the cell. However, it should be noted that other energy carrying molecules, such as GTP, do exist and are used for certain processes.

[[Structural Biochemistry/Anabolism|Anabolic]] and  [[Structural Biochemistry/Catabolism|catabolic]] processes are examples of how the cell couples reactions together to create efficient energy exchange cycles. These processes are explained in more detail in their respective sections; however, it is appropriate to mention them here as they provide a relevant example of reaction coupling. Basically, [[Structural Biochemistry/Catabolism|catabolic]] reactions are those that convert chemical fuels to molecules that the cell can use for energy, such as ATP and other high-energy compounds. [[Structural Biochemistry/Anabolism|Anabolic]] reactions are those that require some amount of energy to occur. Thus, the cell can conveniently couple anabolic reactions with catabolic ones - the products of catabolic reactions can be used to drive anabolic reactions to completion. This allows the cell to link different types of reactions together efficiently; it's almost a type of &quot;cellular recycling&quot;, as the products of one reaction (i.e. a catabolic one) can be re-used to help another reaction reach completion (i.e. an anabolic one).

== Organisms are Energy Transducers ==
Organisms are transducers of energy, since in the transfer of energy they are less than 100% efficient. Organisms employ the energy harnessed to grow, repair, and maintain their bodies. The energy is also use to compete with other organisms, and to produce new organisms (offspring). In the process of doing these things, organisms generate waste, chemicals and heat. Organisms create local regions of order at the expense of using up some fraction of the total supply of useful energy found in the universe.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello World!

It's nice to be joining you. I have no immediate prospects for editing or authoring but am enticed by the possibility. I am retired now for six years and have a continual guilt regarding my lack of a contribution to the world at large. It seems improper to have worked for only 40 or so years and then sit back and collect social security and pensions for the next 40 (my mother turns 101 this December.) I play golf 3 times a week, work in the community garden for 4-5 hours a week, spend untold hours on the internet researching genealogy (8,000+ direct ancestors) or working my stamp collection. I'm hoping that Wikibooks may be the outlet that gives me some additional pride in my existence.</text>

=OpenBSD as a Desktop=

This is a guide on using OpenBSD as a desktop/workstation. This guide was made using OpenBSD 4.3 and 4.4. The concept should be the same in future releases.

==If you are new to unix==
Download the OpenBSD iso file and burn it using an iso burning program.

The download location is:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/&lt;the version you want&gt;/&lt;your processor&gt;/install44.iso&lt;/nowiki&gt;

In my case it is:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/4.3/i386/install44.iso&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Now put the cd into the computer you want to install it on. Once it boots up quickly push F2 (this is called the BIOS). Find the boot sequence option (or similar) and select boot to cdrom. I recommend learning at least the basic commands and some vi beforehand.

==Installation modifications==
Follow the offical OpenBSD install instructions found [http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq4.html here]. Until you come to &quot;Configure the network?&quot;. Enter: yes [default], fxp0 [default], system-hostname [default], no [default], '''dhcp''', '''rtsol''', home [default], 192.168.1.1 [default], yes [default], dhcp [default], no [default], no [default]. Continue until you come to the &quot;lets install the sets&quot;. Enter: cdrom, cd0, 4.3/i386 [default], all, done [default], yes [default]... done [default], yes [default], none [default], '''yes''', no [default], ?, &lt;where you are located&gt;, ?, &lt;your sub-timezone&gt;. Enter in &quot;reboot&quot; and your done!

==Configuring Xorg==
Xorg normally &quot;just work&quot;. If you have a weird screen resolution (or things look weird with xorg), then you need to do more configurations. 

===Method 1===
The configuration file is located at /etc/X11/xorg.conf. However first we need to create the file. Run:
 Xorg -configure

This created a configuration file in your home file. To test the Xorg setting in the configuration file, run:
 Xorg -config /&lt;your home directory&gt;/xorg.conf.new

In my case it is (running as root)
 Xorg -config /root/xorg.conf.new

It could be (running as puffy)
 Xorg -config /home/puffy/xorg.conf.new

To exit out of the test (assuming it worked), press (control)+(alt)+(backspace). If things work, you are lucky. Copy the new configuration file to the /etc/X11/xorg.conf
 cp /&lt;location of your home directory&gt;/xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf

====Extra configurations====
If you were not fortunate enough to have the configurations just work then...

''I am working on it:'' '''I am currently figuring this one out myself. The xorg works however everything is out of proportion.'''

===Method 2===
This method will require knowledge of your graphics card, screen resolution, and monitor. Run the command:
 Xorgconfig

Fill out all of the information. If you would like to skip over something then just press enter. In some cases you can not skip steps without messing up your configuration file. At the end of the questionare say &quot;yes&quot; to writing to the xorg.conf file.

==Get a desktop enviroment working==
OpenBSD has a great package management system (even if it is sometimes outdated). If you get the packages from the ftp site the pkg_add will find the dependencies for you. Export your PKG_PATH to your favorite ftp site. The ftp format is: 

 &lt;nowiki&gt;ftp://&lt;your mirror&gt;/pub/OpenBSD/&lt;your version&gt;/packages/&lt;your processor&gt;/&lt;/nowiki&gt;

In my case it is:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;# export PKG_PATH=ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/4.3/packages/i386/&lt;/nowiki&gt;

You may even want to put this into your .profile. 

&lt;font size=0&gt;
The packages are found through http [http://www.openbsd.org/4.3_packages/ here] (for 4.3 packages).
&lt;br&gt;
The packages are also found through ftp [ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/4.3/packages/i386/ here] (for 4.3 i386 packages).
&lt;/font&gt;

===KDE (3.5)===
Here are the main packages the pkg_add should resolve the dependencies.

:kdebase
:kdelibs
:kdeaddons
:kdeadmin
:kdeartwork
:kdeedu
:kdegames
:kdegraphics
:kdemultimedia
:kdenetwork
:kdepim
:kdesdk
:kdetoys
:kdeutils
:kdeaccessibility

I personally prefer to install them all at once. You may also want to add the -v option, if you want to see the details of the installation.

 pkg_add kdebase;pkg_add kdelibs;pkg_add kdeaddons;pkg_add kdeadmin;pkg_add kdeartwork;pkg_add kdeedu;pkg_add kdegames;pkg_add kdegraphics &lt;br&gt;;pkg_add kdemultimedia;pkg_add kdenetwork;pkg_add kdepim;pkg_add kdesdk;pkg_add kdetoys;pkg_add kdeutils;pkg_add &lt;/br&gt; kdeaccessibility

To run kde do

 Startkde

===Xfce (4.4)===
[[Image:Xfce-openbsd.png|250px|thumb|Xfce on OpenBSD]]

Here are the main packages the pkg_add should resolve the dependencies. (Xfce likes to keep their applications in separate packages)
:gtk-xfce-engine
:libxfce4mcs
:libxfcegui4
:xfce-mcs-manager
:xfce-mcs-plugins
:xfce-utils
:xfce4-appfinder
:xfce4-battery
:xfce4-clipman
:xfce4-datetime
:xfce4-dict
:xfce4-diskperf
:xfce4-fsguard
:xfce4-icon-theme
:xfce4-genmon
:xfce4-mailwatch
:xfce4-mixer
:xfce4-mpc
:xfce4-netload
:xfce4-notes
:xfce4-panel
:xfce4-places-plugin
:xfce4-session
:xfce4-systemload
:xfce4-time-out
:xfce4-verve
:xfce4-wavelan
:xfce4-weather
:xfce4-wmdock
:xfce4-xkb
:xfdesktop
:xfwm4
:xfwm4-themes

To run xfce do

 startxfce4

==Using ports==
Although the binaries are sometime out of date the ports are amazingly up to date, new software is ported to OpenBSD after hours of release. 

First get the ports from the install cdrom. 
First we have to make a directory to mount the drive to. Enter in the command:
 cd /mnt
 mkdir cdrom

Mount the cdrom by entering in the command:
 mount /dev/cd0a /mnt/cdrom

Now copy ports.tar.gz to /usr:
 cp /mnt/cdrom/ports.tar.gz /usr

Now untar the ports:
 tar xvf ports.tar.gz

To update the port tree, cd into the file that you want to update and enter in the command:
 cd &lt;what you want to update&gt;
 make checksum REFETCH=true

This may take a while...

To install a ports, cd into the CVS that you want to compile and do:
 cd &lt;what you want to install&gt;
 make install clean

The port system should compile the dependencies for you. Warning: compiling may take several days. Most notibily the port system includes: e17 and KDE 4.1.

&lt;font size=0&gt;
All of the ports are found: [http://openports.se/ here]
&lt;/font&gt;

==Get a display manager working==
===GDM (recomended)===
Only one main package:
 pkg_add gdm

Now vi the configuration file &quot;rc&quot;. Scroll down to the bottom of the configuration file. (it is a long configuration file):

 vi /etc/rc

Scroll down until you see:
 #Alternatively, on some architectures, xdm may be started in /etc/ttys
 if [ X&quot;${xdm_flags}&quot; != X&quot;NO&quot; ]; then 
 echo 'starting xdm...';        /usr/X11R6/bin/xdm ${xdm_flags}
 fi

Edit it so that it will start gdm as opposed to xdm. Replace it with: 
 #Alternatively, on some architectures, xdm may be started in /etc/ttys
 if [ X&quot;${xdm_flags}&quot; != X&quot;NO&quot; ]; then 
 echo 'starting gdm...';        /usr/local/sbin/gdm ${xdm_flags}
 fi

Now change the xdm flags in /etc/rc.conf. Scroll down until you see:
 # For some architectures, you must also disable console getty in /etc/ttys
 xdm_flags=NO        # for normal use:&quot;&quot;

Change the xdm flags by replacing the NO with &quot;YES&quot;
 # For some architectures, you must also disable console getty in /etc/ttys
 xdm_flags=&quot;YES&quot;        # for normal use:&quot;&quot;

Once you start up gdm change the session to whatever GUI you installed.

'''Warning: GDM does not automatically recognize the KDE session.'''

===KDM (not recomended)===
The reason that this is not recomended, even if you are using KDE, is that someone made an error while porting KDM to OpenBSD. KDM searches for startkdeconfig in the wrong directory and you are thus locked out.

==1. State the role each of the following played in the development of flying balloons.==
===a. Joseph Michel Montgolfier and Jacques-Etienne Montgolfier===
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Josephmontgolfier.jpg|Joseph Michel Montgolfier
Image:Jacques Étienne Montgolfier.jpg|Jacques-Etienne Montgolfier
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Joseph-Michel Montgolfier (26 August 1740 – 26 June 1810) and Jacques-Étienne Montgolfier (6 January 1745 – 2 August 1799) were the inventors of the montgolfière, or airship. The brothers succeeded in launching the first manned ascent, carrying a young physician and an audacious army officer into the sky.

Of the two brothers, it was Joseph who first contemplated building &quot;machines&quot;. Joseph observed laundry drying over a fire incidentally form pockets that billowed upwards. Joseph set about building a box-like chamber {{units|1 by 1 by 1.3 meters|3 by 3 by 4 ft}} out of very thin wood and covering the sides and top with lightweight taffeta cloth. Under the bottom of the box he crumpled and lit some paper. The contraption quickly lifted off its stand and collided with the ceiling. Joseph then recruited his brother to balloon building.

The two brothers then set about building a contraption 3 times larger in scale (27 times larger in volume). The lifting force was so great that they lost control of their craft on its very first test flight on 14 December 1782. The device floated nearly 2 kilometres (about 1.2 mi). It was destroyed after landing by the &quot;indiscretion&quot; of passersby.

===b. Jean Francois Pilatre de Rozier and Francois Laurent Marquis d'Arlandes.===
[[image:Early flight 02562u (4).jpg|thumb|200px|The first untethered balloon flight, by Rozier and the Marquis d'Arlandes on 21 November 1783.]]
Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier (30 March 1754 – 15 June 1785) was a French chemistry and physics teacher, and one of the first pioneers of aviation. His balloon crashed near Wimereux in the Pas-de-Calais during an attempt to fly across the English Channel, and he and his companion, Pierre Romain, became the first known victims of an air crash.

In June 1783, he witnessed the first balloon flight of the Montgolfier brothers. On 19 September, he assisted with the untethered flight of a sheep, a cockerel and a duck from the front courtyard of the Palace of Versailles. After a variety of tests in October, he made the first manned free flight in history on 21 November 1783, accompanied by the ambitious Marquis d'Arlandes. During the 25-minute flight using a Montgolfier hot air balloon, they traveled 12 kilometres from the Château de la Muette to the Butte-aux-Cailles, then in the outskirts of Paris, attaining an altitude of 3,000 feet.

===c. [[w:Jacques_Alexandre_Cesar_Charles|Jacques Alexandre Cesar Charles]] and Nicolas Louis Robert.===
In December of 1783, these two flew the first gas balloon, filled with hydrogen. This flight lasted for at least 2 hours, starting from the Tuileries gardens in Paris, and landing outside Paris where it was destroyed by terrified peasants. 

Charles went on to discover [[w:Charles's_Law| Charles' Law]] which describes the relationship between the density of a gas and its temperature.

===d. [[w:Ben_Abruzzo|Ben L. Abruzzo]], [[w:Maxie_Anderson|Maxie L. Anderson]], and Larry Newman===
From 11 August to 17 August, 1978, these three completed the first transatlantic balloon flight in the [[w:Double_Eagle_II|Double Eagle II]]. They began their flight from Presque Isle, Maine and ended their flight at Miserey, France. 

Ben Abruzzo and Larry Newman were also pilots on the [[w:Double_Eagle_V|Double Eagle V]] which in 1981 was the first balloon to cross the Pacific Ocean.

===e. [[w:Bertrand_Piccard|Bertrand Piccard]] and [[w:Brian_Jones_(aeronaut)|Brian Jones]]===
On March 1, 1999, Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones began the first balloon flight to circumnavigate the earth. Their flight was a success and ended on March 20, 1999. The flight took 19 days and 21 hours. The flight started in Switzerland and ended in Egypt.

==2. Cite the principle of Archimedes, and briefly describe how it applies to each of the following: ==
::Archimedes' Principle states: ''any body fully or partially submerged in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced.''
:;a. A piece of cork floating in a bowl of water.
Cork is less dense than water, and weighs less than the volume of water displaced, causing the cork to float.
:;b. A ship floating in the ocean
Ships, though made of dense materials, are shaped so that much of the interior is air. Because the weight of the ship and its cargo is less than the volume of water displaced, the ship will float.
:;c. A hot air balloon floating in the atmosphere
As long as a balloon plus the gas it contains weighs less than the atmospheric air which it displaces, the balloon will float in the air.

==3. Using a textbook of Chemistry, or a reference book of scientific tables, draw up a simple table showing the composition of air by weight and by volume.==
{|border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
! Gas || Air Percentage || Weight of pure gas
|-
|Nitrogen || 78%||  1.25 g/liter
|-
|Oxygen ||21%|| 1.43 g/liter
|-
|Argon  ||.93%|| 1.78 g/liter
|-
|Carbon Dioxide  ||.03%||1.96 g/liter
|-
|Other (including Neon, Helium, &lt;br&gt;Hydrogen, Xenon, &amp; Radon)|| .04%||      
|}

To calculate the average weight of air in a balloon it can be worked out using rough percentages 70% Nitrogen and 30% oxygen as the make up of air. Atomic weight of Nitrogen is 14 g. Atomic weight of Oxygen is 16 g. Nitrogen and Oxygen gasses are formed using two atoms. So for a balloon with 22.4 litres of air use this formular. Of course if you want it more accurate the exact percentages of all gasses present would be used. 

70% x 28 + 30% x 32 = 0.7 x 28 + 0.3 x 32 = 19.6 + 9.6 = 29.2

So a balloon with 22.4 litres of air weighs 29.2 g plus the weight of the balloon. 

&lt;!-- See talk page for discussion of this section

To calculate weights of gases. One mole of the gas has a vloume of 22.4 litres.Avogadro's number. 

Eg, Helium has an atomic weight of 4 g per mole so the weight of 22.4 l = 4 grams. Oxygen as a gas has two Oxygen atoms so the weight is twice the atomic weight.
--&gt;

==4. Draw up a simple table showing a comparison of the atomic number, atomic weight, and density of hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, and oxygen.==

==5. Name two gases that are used in flying gas filled balloons.==
Hydrogen &amp; Helium are both less dense than air and may be used when flying a balloon. Warm air is also used for flying balloons, since it is less dense than cold air.

*Note: Hydrogen burns violently when ignited.  After the destruction of the Hindenburg, hydrogen was largely abandoned for the flying of manned balloons.

==6. Explain how heat/temperature affect the density of air, and how this applies to flying hot air balloons.==
As described by [[w:Charles's_Law|Charles' Law]], heat applied to a gas will cause its molecules to move farther apart, reducing it's density. When the air in a balloon is heated above the temperature of the surrounding air, the air in the balloon becomes less dense than the air outside the balloon. Because the balloon is less dense, it will float or rise. The greater the difference in temperature between the air in the balloon and the surrounding air, the greater the difference in density between the air inside and outside the balloon, which increases the lift that the balloon will generate. This explains why balloons are mostly launched in cooler weather.

==7. Explain the role of each of the following in the structure and flying of a hot air balloon.==
; a. Envelope: The outer skin of the balloon, forming the container that holds the gas.
; b. Support structure: The framework of larger balloons.
; c. Throat: The lower opening through which the hot flame is applied to heat the air.
; d. Fuel source: The fuel used to heat the air to make the balloon less dense than the surrounding air.

==8. Name two materials that may be used for the envelope of a hot air balloon, and compare the advantages each accords because of its properties.==
;Paper: Paper may be used for model hot air balloons because of ease of acquisition and low price.
;Plastic: Plastic may be used for model hot air balloons because it is water resistant, easy to work with, and easy to acquire.
;Fabric: Fabric is usually used for larger, manned balloons. The fabric is specially treated.

==9. Describe how flying balloons have served a useful function in==
=== a. Military campaigns===
Military uses include: “eyes in the sky”, observation of enemy troops and positions, delivery of explosives to enemy positions, and defensive use of entangling incoming enemy flying craft.
===b. Scientific research===
Scientific uses include instrument transport for data collecting, atmospheric studies, and aerial photography.

==10. At what time of the day do most sport balloon flights take place? Why?==
Early morning is best because the air has cooled over night making the difference of temperature inside &amp; outside greater, thus increasing buoyancy.

==11. Describe how a pilot controls the vertical movement of==
===a. A hot air balloon===
The pilot controls the vertical movement of a hot air balloon by burning more fuel to make the air in the balloon hotter, causes the air in the balloon to become less dense, making it rise. Conversely, turning off the flame and allowing the air in the balloon to cool renders the air in the balloon more dense with respect to the surrounding atmosphere, causing the balloon to descend. More rapid increases in altitude can be achieved by lessening the weight of the balloon usually by dropping ballast, however this is limited by the amount of ballast available.

===b. A gas filled balloon===
Adding more of the lighter than air gas to ascend, and spilling some of the gas in order to descend varies the altitude of a helium or hydrogen filled balloon.

==12. Describe how a pilot controls the lateral or horizontal movement of a flying balloon.==
Horizontal movement of a gas filled flying balloon is entirely at the mercy of air currents. The pilot can only vary the altitude so as to get into the path of air currents, such as the jet stream. This involves careful study of charts of air currents, close attention to weather data, and a certain element of trial and error. Older airships, like the Hindenburg, had a rudder and propellers to move it so that it did not have to depend on air currents.

==13. Build to completion one model hot air balloon ( or two if working in pairs ).==
===Materials===
* Tissue paper
* Scissors
* Glue Stick(s)
* Sewing pins (optional)
* Thin wire (22 gauge is suggested)
* Needle-nose pliers &amp; wire cutters
* 1 50&quot;x20&quot; piece of Linoleum (for making balloon panel form)
* A spool of string

===Directions for balloon panel form===
[[image:AYHAB-Model-Hot-Air-Balloons-draw2.png|thumb|400px|Illustration of distance from center]]

Use a rigid or semi-rigid material such as poster board or a piece of linoleum flooring. I would suggest a piece of linoleum flooring,as it is more rigid and can be used more times. Cut out a piece that is 50 inches long and 20 inches wide. For every other measurement, you will have to measure from the center of the form you are creating. You will need to mark each measurement on the outside edge (furthest from the center of the form).

* The first measurement is the very bottom of the form (and all others will be going from bottom to top) and is 3 1/2 inches each direction from the center.&lt;br&gt;
* Seven inches from the bottom is another measurement of 3 1/2 inches from center.&lt;br&gt;
* Four inches up the center line is a measurement of 4 7/8 inches from center.&lt;br&gt;
* Four more inches up the center line is a measurement of 6 3/4 inches from center.&lt;br&gt;
* Six inches up the center line is a measurement of 8 5/8 inches from center.&lt;br&gt;
* Six more inches up the center line is a measurement of 9 5/8 inches from center (this is the widest measurement).&lt;br&gt;
* Six inches beyond the widest measurement is a smaller measurement of 9 1/8 inches from center.&lt;br&gt;
* Three inches up the line is a measurement of 7 1/2 inches from center.&lt;br&gt;
* Three inches further is a measurement of 6 1/2 inches from center.&lt;br&gt;
* Three inches further is a measurement of 4 3/4 inches from center.&lt;br&gt;
* Three inches further is a measurement of 3 inches from center.&lt;br&gt;
* Finally, 2 3/4 to 3 inches further is your top measurement. The top measurement is 1 5/8 inches from center.

Take the pen you are using to mark the measurements with and draw a line, starting from the bottom measurement, all the way around the outside of the measurement. It will look like a light bulb.

Cut along the line that you just drew to remove the extra material around the &quot;light bulb&quot; shape. That should give you the form needed to create the proper shape for the panels of your balloon.

===Directions for making balloon===
# Take 2 pieces of tissue paper and glue them end to end (vertically). Continue doing this with each set of tissue paper until you have 6 panels (a panel is 2 pieces of tissue paper glued end to end (vertically). You should only glue about a thumb's width or one straight line with the glue stick.
# Once you have 6 panels, lay them one on top of another, making sure that one end of the stack has an even edge at the bottom of the panels.*
# Take your Panel Form and lay it on top of your 6 panels. line up the bottom of the form with the straight edge of your 6 panels.
# Trace, with a black marker, along the edge of the form (making sure not to move the form or the panels). The form will not reach the other end your your panel stack. This is alright. Just keep tracing beyond the form in a diagonal line until you reach the top of your panel stack. Then remove the form from on top of the your panels.
# Take your scissors and cut on the outside of the black lines that you created by tracing the panel form. When you are done, you should have two (2) sets of scrap, one on each side of your panels. DO NOT THROW THESE AWAY! You may need to patch some panels that develop holes as well as use some of it to create a top for your balloon.
# Take the top two (2) panels and pull them out beyond your other panels. Pull the bottom of the two panels out about one inch from the top panel. Take your scissors, and cut flaps into the bottom panel. &lt;u&gt;Only cut in about 1/2 an inch deep.&lt;/u&gt; Do this all the way along one side of the bottom of the two panels. The flaps make it much easier to attach panels together.
# Take a glue stick and apply glue to the top of the two panels. You want to apply the glue to the side of the panel that is next to the flaps that you just cut. Also when applying the glue, you will only need one glue stick width of glue along the edge. Because the glue dries quickly, you may want to apply, at most, enough glue for 2 or 3 flaps at a time. Then you will fold over the flaps on the bottom panel onto the edge of the top panel where the glue was applied. Continue doing this until you have fully attached 2 of the panels together.
# Take a third panel and lay it on top of the 2 panels that you just glued together. Lay it so that the edge of the top panel, of the 2 attached panels, that has not been glued is exposed about an inch.
# Once again, cut flaps on the inch of exposed panel that are about a half inch deep. The glue and fold over the flaps to attach the third panel to the second panel. Now you should have 3 panels attached together. Continue repeating steps 8 &amp; 9 (Disregard the 2 panels reference in 8. Instead understand that it will now refer to the 2 panels that you just joined.) until all of your panels have been attached. '''Remember to alternate which side you are cutting the flaps on so that you do not tamper with any of the joints of the other panels.'''
# Once you have attached all 6 of your panels together, flip them over. Raise the top panel and fold the inner panels back. Do not crease the inner panels. Then replace the top panel.
# Cut the bottom panel just as you have every panel before. Remember to make the cuts only about 1/2 inch deep. Then pull the top panel towards the edge of the bottom panel until you have the same width of the bottom panel as you would have for previous panels.
# Apply glue to the top panel just as you have for every panel before. Remember that it may be easier to apply glue for only 2 or 3 panels at a time and then fold the flaps over before continuing to apply the glue.
# Now. Open up your balloon. You will notice that it does not have a top yet. From the scraps that you saved, when you cut out your panels, pick as large a piece as possible. From this piece, cut as large a circle as you can. (You may fold the piece of paper over once or twice to make cutting out the circle easier.)
# Apply glue to the circle you just cut out (around the outside edges by one or two glue stick widths). Then attach the circle to the top of your balloon to cover the hole.
# Take some wire and cut roughly a 2 foot section off of the spool.
# Take some needle-nose pliers and shape the wire into a rigid circle. (I suggest making a little loop in one end. Turning it slightly. Threading other end of the wire through the loop a little ways and the twisting the threaded wire around the looped end. This keeps the wire circle from expanding or contracting in size.)
# Put the open end of the balloon through the wire circle. Then fold the balloon over the wire and glue the folded over end back to the balloon. (You may cut flaps in the open end of the balloon to make it easier to glue.) There will be more balloon surface than wire. You may have to fold the end of a panel or two over a little to decrease the amount of panel that you have to deal with while gluing the balloon over the wire.
# At this point your balloon is finished. You will want to go over the entire surface of the balloon to make sure there are no holes in the panels, no unglued panel joints, no unglued balloon cap spots, or rips at the bottom where the wire is. If there are any of these issues, take some of your left over scraps (Aren't you glad you saved them?) and patch the balloon by gluing pieces from your scraps over any holes.

==14. Successfully launch, fly, and recover the model hot air balloon(s) which you have built.==

[[Image:launching balloon at night.jpg|thumb|300px|left|launching balloon at night]]

Take a single burner camp stove and use it to heat the air underneath your balloon. Be careful not to get the balloon too close to the flame as it will ignite and burn up.

A more efficient way of getting hot air into your balloon is to take some rigid dryer vent, cut notches that can be slid over the pot stabilizers on your camp stove, and then slide the vent pipe onto the stove. This causes the heated air to be channeled up the vent pipe into the balloon. However, this does not eliminate the possibility of your balloon igniting and burning up. You will have to keep the balloon from touching the vent pipe and also watch the balloon to make sure it doesn't start turning brown nearest the vent pipe.

You will need two (2) people to launch the balloon. One to hold the top end of the balloon up (until enough hot air is within the balloon), and the other to hold the balloon mouth over the stove. Before holding the balloon over the stove, tie a spool of string to the wire that keeps the form of the balloons mouth. Hold the balloon over the stove so that hot air may enter the balloon. Keep the balloon over the stove until it looks/feels as though it is ready to take off (usually anywhere from 30-45 seconds will do). When enough hot air has entered the balloon, release the balloon and let it fly up and away. Let the balloon fly for about twenty (20) seconds. When the balloon has successfully been flown pull on the string that you attached to the balloon to recover the balloon. The string keeps the balloon from being blown away as well as keeping it from flying into trees or other objects.

Please keep safe by using heat resistant gloves such as oven mitts or welders gloves. The metal duct does get hot. The balloon is not over the duct pipe long enough to catch fire. We had to have both gas burners going to get sufficient heat up the pipe. Happy flying. There is a good DVD called ''Night Crossing'' about a family who escaped over the Berlin boarder. They built two balloons and had two attempts to freedom.

===Usage===
This can be placed on a user's talk page to indicate either a temporary or indefinite block. If a block is not indefinite, specify a time period with {{para|time}}.  To provide a custom explanation for the block, use {{para|reason}}. You can optionally use {{para|sig|yes}} to add a signature ''inside'' the template message.

===Examples===
{{tlxs|blocked}}
{{blocked}}
{{tlxs|blocked|time&amp;#61;1 week}}
{{blocked|time=1 week}}
{{tlxs|blocked|time&amp;#61;1 month|reason&amp;#61;persistent vandalism|sig&amp;#61;yes}}
{{blocked|time=1 month|reason=persistent vandalism|sig=yes}}

=== Expressions ===

'''はじめまして'''

This expression is only used when you first meet someone and has the same meaning as &quot;Nice to meet you&quot; or &quot;How do you do?&quot;  

'''よろしくおねがいします'''

This expression is difficult to translate into English.  It's a greeting statement that's common after 「はじめまして」.  In this context, it's like asking &quot;Please favor me with your friendship&quot;  or &quot;I'm looking forward to working with you.&quot;   There are many different levels of politeness for this expression.   From most polite to casual, we have

:どうぞよろしくおねがいします
:よろしくおねがいします
:どうぞよろしく
:よろしく

The decision to which to use depends on the listener.  「よろしくおねがいします」 is polite enough for most circumstances.

== Grammar Overview ==



=== The question particle ===

The kana 「か」 is used at the end of the sentence, after a verb, to indicate that the sentence is a question or doubt. The use of a question mark is optional, and most of the time a 「。」 is used. Some people must substitute the 「か」 with the question marker, but even in these cases the sound is still spoken.


=== The さん Honorific ===
* 〜さん (''-san'') is an honorific suffix denoting Mr., Miss, Mrs., or Ms. 
:: すずき さん
:: ''Suzuki-san''
:: Mr/Ms Suzuki.

This should be used when speaking to someone of higher status (e.g., your boss) or out of respect to another individual.  There are many more honorifics that may be used.  You do not attach an honorific to your own name.  However, there are exceptions to this (e.g., sensei.)
&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

===What is a copula?===

In English, the verb 'to be' serves two purposes: It acts as the copula, and it acts as the verb for existence. However, in many languages, including Japanese, these two verbs are separate—so it helps to have an understanding of the difference between the two usages.

A copula can be thought of as an equals sign: it equates two things to each other. In the sentence &quot;That is a dog,&quot; 'is' is the copula. In the sentence &quot;The dog is inside,&quot; you don't mean that 'the dog' and 'inside' are the same thing; you mean that the dog exists inside.

These two usages have different verbs in Japanese, so it'd be good to get used to it now. Here are some examples:

Using 'to be' as a copula:
* That man is the president.
* Joe is a salesman.
* The dog is a golden retriever.
* This paper is my report.

Using 'to be' to mean existence:
* Sara is outside.
* The plate is on the table.
* The watch is on my wrist.
* They are at the mall.
* There is John.

In Japanese, です is the copula.  It is used to equate two things, not used for existence of an item.  Japanese uses two separate verb to express existence of inanimate and animate items.  [[wiki:Copula_(linguistics) | Wikipedia]] has a detail entry on the copula, its basic use, and its use in various languages.  The negative form of です is  じゃ ありません.  This is an example of verb [[wiki:Grammatical_conjugation|conjugation]].  As you would imagine, this would mean two items are not equal to each other.
&lt;center&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+'''です  Conjugation'''
|-
! Type of speech !! Verb
|-
! Non-past
|  です
|-

| じゃ ありません
|}

&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+'''Examples&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'''
|-
! Japanese !! Translation
|-
| pencil です
| (This) is a pencil.
|-
| dictionary じゃ ありません.  
| (This) is not a dictionary.
|-
 |John です
| I'm John.
|-
| John-san じゃ ありません 
| (That) is not John.
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Note, these are loose translations since there's no topic described.  These examples are meant to illustrate the use of the copula.

===Predicates===
====English Predicates====
In English, we learn that a sentence consists of a '''[[w:Subject (grammar)|subject]]''' and a '''[[w:Predicate (grammar)|predicate]]'''. The predicate of a sentence indicates what the subject is, what the subject does, or what happens to the subject. For example, in the English sentence:

:John is a baseball player.

The subject is &quot;John&quot;, and the predicate is &quot;is a baseball player&quot;. The sentence is about John, but it states that John is something, namely he &quot;is a baseball player.&quot; In English, the predicate of a simple sentence starts with the '''[[w:Verb|verb]]''' and continues to the end of the sentence.

====Japanese Predicates====
In Japanese, a complete sentence must have a predicate, but the subject can be implied rather than stated, which is exactly the case more often than not. The Japanese equivalent of the above sentence would be (informal/formal ending):

:ジョンは{{ruby-2|野球|やきゅう||選手|せんしゅ|}}だ/です。
:''Jon wa yakyuu senshu da / desu.''

However, if you were already talking about John, his name would not be mentioned again and the sentence would be shortened to:

:{{ruby-2|野球|やきゅう||選手|せんしゅ|}}だ/です。
:''Yakyuu senshu da / desu.''

In Japanese, when you want to form a predicate with a noun, the structure to use is:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+'''Noun Predicate Formation'''
|-
! Type of speech !! Japanese !! Roomaji 
|-
! Formal
| NOUN です  || NOUN ''desu''
|-
! Informal
| NOUN だ      || NOUN ''da''
|}

Japanese ''[[w:Japanese particles|particles]]'' (助詞 ''joshi'') are a Japanese part of speech consisting of suffixes or short words which '''follow''' other words such as nouns, verbs and adjectives, to indicate a wide range of grammatical and discursive (communicative) functions. For instance, particles are used to indicate, or ''mark'', the subject, direct object, and so on; in English, this task is normally performed by word order. Particles may also indicate the speaker's assertiveness, certitude, or other feelings. Note that a particle cannot exist by itself, it always '''follows''' another word or phrase.

== Quick explanations ==
* 〜さん (''-san'') is an honorific suffix denoting Mr., Miss, Mrs., or Ms. 
:: すずき さん
:: ''Suzuki-san''
:: Mr/Ms Suzuki.
* The easiest Japanese sentence contains just one word followed by です. です is the [[some link to a longer explanation|Japanese Copula]], linking two words much like the English word &quot;to be&quot;. For example: そうです - soo desu, meaning &quot;it is so&quot;. Note that very often the subject will be implied in Japanese, and です doesn't change for different people, so if you see ぐみです that could mean &quot;I am Gumi&quot; or &quot;He is Gumi&quot; (or even &quot;you are Gumi&quot; or &quot;they are Gumi&quot; or anything &quot;be Gumi&quot;) depending on the context.
* To turn any sentence into a yes/no question, add the [[some link to a longer explanation|particle]] か : そうですか? - Is that so? か is used at the end of the sentence, after a verb, to the point that it has become synonymous with a question mark. Some people don't write か anymore and just write ? (still pronouncing the &quot;ka&quot; though). But in most cases you will see &quot;か。&quot; at the end of a question - the &quot;?&quot; is optional as か is marker enough. 
* When meeting somebody for the first time, say &quot;はじめまして&quot; (nice to meet you). Don't say this when you've met them before. Also don't forget the phrase &quot;よろしくおねがいします&quot; (please be kind to me). Japanese is full of funny polite expressions like that.</text>

== Description ==

This component blurs a color image.  It's expensive but reduces noise. 

== Input ==

[[Image:SwisTrack_ColorImage.jpg]]

A grayscale or a color image.


== Parameters ==

=== Mode ===
The type of blur.  This is from the openCV documentation:
        * CV_BLUR_NO_SCALE (simple blur with no scaling) - summation over a pixel param1×param2 neighborhood. 
          If the neighborhood size is not fixed, one may use cvIntegral function.
        * CV_BLUR (simple blur) - summation over a pixel param1×param2 neighborhood with subsequent scaling by 1/(param1•param2).
        * CV_GAUSSIAN (gaussian blur) - convolving image with param1×param2 Gaussian.
        * CV_MEDIAN (median blur) - finding median of param1×param1 neighborhood (i.e. the neighborhood is square).
        * CV_BILATERAL (bilateral filter) - applying bilateral 3x3 filtering with color sigma=param1 and space sigma=param2.

=== Radius ===
The size of the square to average over.</text>
