      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
Compulsory vaccination has faced widespread resistance in the U.S. since its introduction in the 1900's, largely based on claims that vaccines have negative health effects. Even after these claims have been scientifically rejected, as in the case of thiomersal and autism, the initial fear that these allegations incited still hold fast in the public psyche. 

An in depth understanding of vaccination requires a level of scientific knowledge above that of the average citizen. This lack of full understanding creates a sense of doubt about the safety and efficacy of vaccination. The innate inability of scientific research to make definitive claims adds to this sense of doubt and lowers confidence in positive research findings. There is additional uncertainty surrounding the vaccination and autism debate because there is very little known about the cause of autism. 

As previously prevalent diseases such as measles and polio are now managed through vaccination, people have become less concerned with the personal and public health benefits of vaccination and more concerned with the possible side effects. While the proponents of vaccination present their claims in a technical format, the opponents of vaccination use emotionally charged arguments and the media to voice their beliefs. This dynamic combination of factors makes the case of thiomersal in vaccines one example of when scientific data alone does not carry enough weight to generate social acceptance of a technology.

=History of Vaccination Acceptance=
The first inoculation is believed to have occurred in China in 1000 CE when the son of a Chinese statesman was inoculated against smallpox via powdered smallpox scabs blown into his nostrils.&lt;ref&gt;The College of Physicians of Philadelphia. (2011). The history of vaccines. ''Timeline''. http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/timelines/all&lt;/ref&gt; The first traditional vaccine was made against smallpox as well, approximately 800 years later in 1796. When the smallpox vaccine was developed by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Jenner Edward Jenner], the mortality rate of smallpox patients was approximately 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Medscape Reference. (n.d.). Drugs, diseases, &amp; procedures. ''CBRNE-Smallpox''. http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/830328-overview&lt;/ref&gt; Although there was a high risk of infection, many were initially reluctant to be inoculated because the existing medical methodology favored treatment over prevention and the original vaccines contained live cowpox virus.&lt;ref&gt; U.S. National Library of Medicine. (2002).''Smallpox, a great and terrible scourge''. http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/smallpox/sp_vaccination.html&lt;/ref&gt; As vaccine manufacturing improved and people began to see the immense health benefits, public acceptance grew rapidly. By 1979 the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization World Health Organization] deemed smallpox eradicated, a huge milestone for public health.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. (2011). Global Alert and Response. ''Smallpox''. http://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/en/&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1796, more vaccines have been developed for many dangerous diseases, from diphtheria to measles to mumps. In the 1990s, the number of vaccines recommended for the childhood vaccination schedule doubled.&lt;ref&gt; Offit, Paul. (2010). Vaccine Education Center. ''History of Vaccine Schedule''.  http://www.chop.edu/service/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-schedule/history-of-vaccine-schedule.html&lt;/ref&gt; Today, children can be given as many as 21 immunizations in the first 15 months of life.&lt;ref&gt; Prate, Dawn. (2005) Natural news. The great thiomersal cover-up: mercury, vaccines, autism, and your child's health.  http://www.naturalnews.com/011764.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

As vaccines continue to lower the incidence of infectious diseases, citizens have become less interested in the consequences of preventable illnesses and more concerned about potential risks associated with vaccines. Because all patients must legally be made aware of potential side effects, no matter how rare, any illness following immunization is often associated with the vaccine. Although there are always risks attributable to vaccination, many perceived side effects are unrelated and occur after vaccination by coincidence.

=Thiomersal and Autism Debate=
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiomersal Thiomersal] is a mercury-based preservative used to prevent the growth of bacteria and fungi in multi-dose vials of vaccines by inactivating organisms and toxins and desterilizing the vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. (2006). Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety. ''Thiomersal and vaccines: questions and answers''. http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/topics/thiomersal/questions/en/&lt;/ref&gt; The necessity for preservatives like thiomersal became clear in Australia in 1928, when Dr. Ewing George Thomson injected 21 children with previously used vials of diphtheria vaccine serum in Australia. Twelve of the 21 children given the vaccination in this round of doses died of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus staphylococcus] infection, which could have been prevented by the use of a preservative. Following this incident, the Royal Commission recommended that all multi-dose vials should contain preservatives.&lt;ref&gt;Division of Communication and Consumer Affairs. (2010). Vaccines, Blood, &amp; Biologics. ''Thiomersal in vaccines''. http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/UCM096228&lt;/ref&gt; 

As their use has increased since then, preservatives have faced scrutiny due to their chemical content. In 1998, a paper by Andrew Wakefield was published in ''The Lancet'' claiming to have found a distinct correlation between autism and the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMR_vaccine measles, mumps, and rubella] (MMR) vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Gardiner. (2010). The New York Times. ''Journal retracts 1998 paper linking autism to vaccines''. http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/03/health/research/03lancet.html&lt;/ref&gt; Wakefield and his colleagues claimed that autism-like symptoms were observed within two weeks of the MMR vaccination. The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] (CDC) and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Pediatrics American Academy of Pediatrics] (AAP) responded by recommending the reduction of thiomersal in children's vaccines as a precautionary measure.&lt;ref&gt;Vaccinations and autism. ''Mercury Poisoning News''. http://www.mercurypoisoningnews.com/vacautism.html&lt;/ref&gt; As resistance continued to grow, thiomersal was removed from or reduced in all vaccines manufactured for the U.S. in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;''Timeline: Thimerosal in vaccines (1999-2008)''. (2011, February 08). http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/thimerosal_timeline.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, multiple studies published in peer reviewed journals found no evidence associating autism and the MMR vaccine containing thiomersal; highly respected scientists were unable to replicate Wakefield’s data.&lt;ref&gt;Dominus, Susan. (2011). The New York Times. ''The crash and burn of an autism guru''. http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/24/magazine/mag-24Autism-t.html?pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt; 

This created a sense of doubt leading to a federal investigators of Wakefield’s credibility. Soon thereafter, the 1998 Wakefield study was deemed to be fraudulent and investigations found that Andrew Wakefield had abused the children.&lt;ref&gt;Gardener, Amanda. (2011). Newsday.''Doctor behind study linking vaccine to autism accused of deliberate fraud''. http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2011/01/05/andrew-wakefield-the-autism-vaccine-link-and-deliberate-fraud/&lt;/ref&gt; Although Wakefield's research was falsified and the government has continued to assure the public that thiomersal-containing vaccines are safe, parents of children with autism continue to rally around the idea that the disease was induced by vaccination.

=Opposition to Thiomersal =
The opponents of vaccination argue that thiomersal and other vaccine impurities can directly cause autism. Despite the lack of scientific evidence backing this claim, they continue to press for the elimination of these toxins from vaccines. Another faction in the opposition believes that children receive too many vaccines; they advocate for a change in youth vaccination schedules. The anti-vaccination movement has emerged as a result, bringing the issue to the public eye through the use of the media and publicity campaigns. 

===Generation Rescue===
[[Image:Jenny McCarthy at E3 2006.jpg|thumb|196px|right|Jenny McCarthy]]
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Rescue Generation Rescue] is a nonprofit organization dedicated to researching causes of autism and helping children receive treatment. The organization is comprised of scientists, physicians, and parents who believe that autism is caused by environmental toxins, including those found in vaccines. Its purpose is to educate parents about autism prevention techniques and how to improve their children’s conditions through proper treatment.&lt;ref&gt;‘’Generation rescue’’. (2011). https://www.filanthropists.com/Charity/Generation-Rescue.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Jenny McCarthy, a leader in the anti-vaccination movement and the current president of Generation Rescue believes that children receive “too many vaccines, too soon, many of which are toxic.”&lt;ref&gt;’’A message from jenny mccarthy generation rescue president’’. (2011) http://www.generationrescue.org/home/about/jenny-mccarthy/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brady, J., &amp; Dahle, S. (2008, June 04). Celeb couple to lead 'green vaccine' rally. ''ABC News''. http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/OnCall/story?id=4987758&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, McCarthy claimed there is a direct link between thiomersal and autism, noting that, “In 1983 the shot schedule was 10. That’s when autism was 1 in 10,000. Now there are 36, and autism is one in 150. All arrows point to one direction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brady, J., &amp; Dahle, S. (2008, June 04). Celeb couple to lead 'green vaccine' rally. ''ABC News''. http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/OnCall/story?id=4987758&lt;/ref&gt; Through her involvement in Generation Rescue, she hopes to raise awareness about dangerous vaccine impurities.&lt;ref&gt;B, P. (2008, January 05). 'Green our vaccine' march with Jim Carrey. ''Jim Carrey Online''. http://www.jimcarreyonline.com/recent/news.php?id=1197&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In March 2008, Generation Rescue joined other national autism advocacy groups and led the ‘Green Our Vaccine’ march in Washington D.C., with the hopes of bringing public attention to the issue.&lt;ref&gt;B, P. (2008, January 05). 'Green our vaccine' march with jim carrey. ''Jim Carrey Online''. http://www.jimcarreyonline.com/recent/news.php?id=1197&lt;/ref&gt; The Green Our Vaccines rally voiced that if there is any possibility that autism is associated with vaccine impurities, then the toxins must be eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;''Austism - green our vaccines''. (2008). http://www.greenourvaccines.net/&lt;/ref&gt; The frequent appearances of McCarthy on talk shows and at rallies has kept the issue in the public eye and overshadowed the scientific evidence that has discredited the opposition altogether.

===Moms Against Mercury===
Moms Against Mercury (MAM) is a nonprofit organization lead by mothers dedicated to bring awareness while educating the public of the dangers of thiomersal.&lt;ref&gt;''About us''. (2007). http://momsagainstmercury.org/aboutus.htm&lt;/ref&gt; They advocate for the elimination of thiomersal in vaccines to make them safer and mercury-free.&lt;ref&gt;''About us''. (2007). http://momsagainstmercury.org/aboutus.htm&lt;/ref&gt; MAM was founded by Amy Carson, who has an autistic son. Carson claims that her son was born a healthy child until he received multiple vaccines growing up.&lt;ref&gt;''About us''. (2007). http://momsagainstmercury.org/aboutus.htm&lt;/ref&gt; When he began to show symptoms of autism, Carson concluded that her son had been poisoned by mercury from the vaccinations. Carson organized MAM to increase public awareness of the issue and educate parents about the harms of vaccines containing mercury preservatives.&lt;ref&gt;''About us''. (2007). http://momsagainstmercury.org/aboutus.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

MAM has met with Congressmen, Senators, and activists across the country to spread the word about thiomersal and other dangerous vaccine components.&lt;ref&gt;''MAM in action''. (2007). http://momsagainstmercury.org/inaction.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has appeared in many newspapers and local network news stories, continuing to proliferate the media with anti-vaccine sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;''MAM in the news''. (2007). http://momsagainstmercury.org/mominnews.htm&lt;/ref&gt; MAM's determination is obvious in their motto, “Fight for truth and justice for our children… And yours.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(2007). http://momsagainstmercury.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

=Federal Support of Vaccination =
There is a growing body of evidence rejecting the correlation between thiomersal in vaccines and the development of autism in children. Although opposition groups have continued to publicize their claims in spite of this research, many groups continue to work towards addressing these concerns and proving that vaccinations are safe. Government agencies such as the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] (CDC) and the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fda Food and Drug Administration] (FDA) are two such groups that aim to inform the public of the truth about the hazards of vaccination and their important benefits. These organizations are one driving force behind the ongoing scientific research attempting to determine whether or not there is a causal link between thiomersal and autism. 

===Federal Agencies===
[[Image:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention logo.gif|thumb|196px|right|Centers for Disease Control]]
Currently, about 1 in every 50 children has autism, a number which has risen since 1990's. While there are many who believe that this rise can be attributed to the use of thiomersal as a preservative in vaccinations for children, numerous studies prove this to be untrue.&lt;ref&gt;McMahon AW, Iskander JK, Haber P, Braun MM, Ball R. Inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in children &lt; 2 years of age: Examination of selected adverse events reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) after thimerosal-free or thimerosal-containing vaccine. ''Vaccine'' (2008) 26(3):427–429&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hornig M, Briese T, Buie T, Bauman ML, Lauwers G, et al. (2008) Lack of Association between Measles Virus Vaccine and Autism with Enteropathy: A Case-Control Study. ''PLoS ONE'' 3(9): e3140. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0003140&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC is one agency with expertise on the topic of vaccinations and their negative effects, with teams of scientists and researchers conducting studies on the nation’s top health concerns.

The CDC is primarily responsible for analyzing the scientifically proven health effects of thiomersal use in vaccines. With a core value of protecting the health of all Americans, the CDC has run studies and scientific reviews to determine whether there is a causal relationship between thiomersal and autism.&lt;ref&gt;''CDC statement on thiomersal and autism.'' CDC Vaccine Safety. http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Concerns/Autism/Index.html&lt;/ref&gt; One such study, the Immunization Safety Review, concluded that “the body of epidemiological evidence favors the rejection of a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Immunization Safety Review:Vaccines and Autism.'' Institute of Medicine. (2004). http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2004/Immunization-Safety-Review-Vaccines-and-Autism.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Another report issued by the CDC in November 1999 stated that “the demonstrated risks for not vaccinating children far outweigh the theoretical risk for exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccines during the first 6 months of life.”&lt;ref&gt;''Recommendations Regarding the Use of Vaccines That Contain Thimerosal as a Preservative.'' MMWR Weekly. (1999) http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4843a4.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1999, the FDA also conducted a review of thiomersal in childhood vaccines, which failed to find any evidence of a correlation with autism. This review was undertaken as part of the FDA Modernization Act (FDAMA) of 1997, which included an analysis of overall childhood exposure to ethylmercury (in thiomersal) in the first six months of life, since to date only methylmercury had been studied. This study found that in some cases, the levels of ethylmercury were higher than the recommended levels for methylmercury put out by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Following this, the CDC and FDA, among other public health agencies, urged for the removal of thiomersal from vaccines while further studies were undertaken. Later studies, however, found no negative health effects from ethylmercury.&lt;ref&gt;''Thimerosol in Vaccines.'' Vaccine Safety and Availability. (2010).  http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/UCM096228#act&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program===
The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) was created on October 1, 1988 through the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 by the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services Department of Health and Human Services] (HHS) Health Resources and Services Administration. Although VICP also works to regulate the supply and cost of vaccines, the program is mainly recognized as being the no-fault alternative way to give compensation to patients and the families of those injured by vaccines.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. (n.d.). Health Resources and Services Administration.  ''National vaccine compensation program''. http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

The money used for compensating victims under VICP is kept in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund and managed by the Department of the Treasury. A $0.75 excise tax on each dose of routine vaccines recommended by the CDC maintains this fund. When a claim is filed, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims decides if the family has enough evidence to receive compensation. Throughout the claims review process, the Department of Justice and HHS are also involved.&lt;ref&gt;National Vaccine Information Center. (n.d.).''Injury Compensation''. http://www.nvic.org/injury-compensation.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

VICP is a critical component of the thiomersal and austism debate because all claims arguing that thiomersal caused injury or death must be made with VICP before civil litigation. Approximately 5,000 families have filed claims of vaccine-induced autism, even though there is no scientific evidence of this relationship. VICP has never ruled in favor of a claim that argues the autism-vaccine link.&lt;ref&gt;Interlandi, Jeneen. (2007). The Daily Beast. ''A neverending story''. http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2007/09/25/a-neverending-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Generalizable Lesson ==
&lt;small&gt;(Moved from content page)&lt;/small&gt;
Each nation reacts differently based on their strategic interests to a natural disaster

One incident can dramatically shift public opinion 

2 separate stakeholders:
- people
- governments who have ability to make decisions

----
Limiting the issue to only 2 stakeholders provides a very simplistic model.
There are 4 separate major stakeholders that have an impact in nuclear policy, we could even add a fifth, international organizations:&lt;br&gt;
- consumers (ecological and safety concerns vs low energy price)&lt;br&gt;
- government who have ability to make decisions (sustainability and risk management, technological know how, taxation and job creation, weaponization and energy independence)&lt;br&gt;
- energy producers (if not nationalized, profit)&lt;br&gt;
- nuclear technology owners (return of R&amp;D and profit)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 03:17, 4 December 2011 (UTC)

== Critique ==
There still is a lack of information about the individual nations energy plans in Europe that rely on old plants and require the construction of new ones, especially in the EU, this is especially important to understand the contrast of France's position and for instance why Germany can take the position to exclude the nuclear option, a good example on the economic advantages/disadvantages of out sourcing energy production (especially after the EU legislated against national energy monopolies and for a greater integration of the energy grids).&lt;br&gt;
It is also missing a relation about the choice to invest in a long term building of nuclear plants in the declining economic situation that we will face in the West.&lt;br&gt; 
Also it would be interesting to mention who controls the distinct nuclear plant technologies, and its relation to the national energy plans (some work has already been put in this but in a way that does not permit the reader to connect the points).&lt;br&gt;
There is also a noticeable absence in the important relation between the nuclear energy, and the nuclear weapons and their important place for instance as Russia and the USA decommissions their stockpiles, this runs parallel to the missing of a mention about the reduced availability of usable sources of uranium.

'''&lt;u&gt;Introduction&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;br/&gt;
Serpins are a very large class of proteins that have a wide range of functions, with the most important being inhibition of proteases. The name &quot;serpin&quot; stands for '''Ser'''ine '''P'''rotease '''In'''hibitors since they replicate the 3D stucture of their respective serine protease and block its structure and pathway. Ultimately, serpines hinder the linkage of amino acids in a polypeptide chain which essentially make up the protein and force it to be inactive.
There are over 1000 serpins known today in humans, plants, bacteria, fungi, and even viruses. Many serpins play significant roles in protein catabolism and the first ones to be studied were antitrypsin and antithrombin, which are types of human plasma proteins. Researchers found that these proteins mediated blood inflammation and coagulation respectively and were crucial in human development. A mishap with either of these two Serpins causes diseases such as thrombosis and emphysema. 
&lt;br/&gt;

[[File:PDB 1sek EBI.jpg|thumb|Example of serpin Structure]]


'''&lt;u&gt;Serpin Structure&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;br/&gt;
Analyzing the structure of serpins has helped figure their function and role in the biological world. Although each serpin slightly varies in conformation to make it distinct from the others, most serpins have a similar ordered structure. 
The first serpins that were studied, antitrypsin and antithrombin, showed that all serpins have a distinct fold which allows them to fit inside other proteins and inhibit their functions. Serpins are composed of three β-sheets (referred to as A, B and C), about nine α-helices, and an open region (known as the center loop) which is the site of reaction. The center loop, known as RCL, is the reaction site which initiates inhibition processes and does not always appear on the same area for all serpines. The difference of where the RCL is situated distinguishes each serpine from the next. 

Researchers have found around 36 serpin genes in humans which are classified depending on their structure. Naming of the serpin includes the name of the gene, following by the word &quot;SERPIN&quot;, followed by a letter that corresponds to the class of serpin and a number for the specific gene in the class. 


'''&lt;u&gt;Serpin Function&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;br/&gt;
The main function of serpins is to inhibit proteases, especially serine protease which gives serpines their name.
Some serpins also perform other functions which are noninhibitory. For example, Ovalbumin (found in egg whites) is a serpine which can store nutrients for the egg, thyroxine-hinding globulin is another serpine which transports hormones to various parts of the body, and Maspin is a serpine which controls gene expression of certain tumors. 

[[File:Mich ezx.jpg|left|thumb|Mechanism of Protease Inhibition]]

Serpins with inhibitory roles hinder functions of other proteins, such as protesaes. The way in which they block activity is by attaching to the other protein in a specific structural orientation to stop them from fully functioning. After they have attached to a target, they oversee structural conformations in their target protein which are usually permanent so that the protein cannot perform any other functions. Although the serpin is generally efficient in performing its job, certain mishaps can lead to mutations or protein misfolding, which would inactivate chains of polymers and confirm long protein chains to be useless.
&lt;br/&gt;


'''&lt;u&gt;Serpin Mutations and Diseases&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;br/&gt;
The structure and function of a serpin are easily changed when mutations occur. If protein building is altered, such as a change in the amino acid sequence or a distinction in folding, the identity of the serpin will change. Even a small change in structure will affect the entire function of the serpin and may deem it useless and/or even harmful. Changes in serpin structure leading to genetic disorders or abnormalities are called Serpinopathies. As mentioned earlier, diseases such as emphysema, thrombosis, angiodema, dementia, etc. can result from Serpinopathies.

Two main defects can occur in the body when a Serpin undergoes a mutation. In the first defect, the inactive serpin fails to perform its blocking job and causes the protease to fuel many defects in the body. An example of this defect is emphysema, in which alpha 1-antitrypsin does not perform its duties and the elastase is destructive and incorrectly eliminates useful tissues in the lungs. The second type of defect is when serpins often clump together into bunches and cause harm to the cell by raising the toxicity levels. An example of this defect is clumping of nerve cells in the brain, which results to familial dementia. If many mutations occur, the usual inhibiting functions will not be carried out and the cell can suffer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Non ribosomal peptide synthesis is an alternative pathway that allows production of polypeptides other than through the traditional translation mechanism. The peptides are created here by enzymatic complexes called synthetases and the resulting peptides are generally short, 2-50 residues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;  Non ribosomal peptide synthesis produces several pharmacologically important compounds uncluding antibiotics and immunosuppressors. This biosynthesis pathway is found in many bacteria and fungi. Non Ribosomal Peptide Synthesis (NRPS) utilizes a large monomer pool including all the amino acids and several unnatural amino acids along with aryl acid substrates to produce small molecule metabolites by a series of loading and condensation of peptides. Peptides produced by NRPS dhow peculiar features compared to traditional proteins. First, they can contain standard as well as non-standard amino acids.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt; Sencondly, amino acids are linked not only by an amino-peptide, but also by non-conventional links that form a non-linear peptide backbone.Non ribosomal peptide synthesis is a key mechanism responsible for the biosynthesis of bioactive metabolites in bacteria and fungi. Non ribosomal peptide synthetase genes, generally represent a part of multigene clusters, encode NRP synthetase which in turn, biosynthesize peptide products.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt; an NPR synthetase is generally composed of one or more modules and can terminate ina  thioesterase domain that releases the newly synthesized peptide from the enzyme.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;  Unlike ribosomal peptide synthesis, they do not involve the translation of mRNA in order to begin the synthesis. Because of this there is a very large degree of diversity and gives rise to an extremely varied host of possible products. NRPS is especially relevant because many secondary metabolites produced by this process are of medical importance, creating numerous antibiotics, antibiotic precursors, and immunosuppressant drugs. NRPS is similar to polypeptide synthesis and fatty acid synthesis but NRPS multienzymes do not bind covalently to acyl carrier protein intermediates, instead utilizing only a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP). The PCP has a conserved serine group on an alpha helix replaced by a 4'-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group, which allows it to convert to the ''holo'' form,  and consequently allows for the thiol group at the end of the prosthetic group to attach to other peptides. NRPS begins with the loading of an activated aminoacyl–adenylate onto the PCP, and then undergoes a process of adenylation and condensation until the thiostearase domain completes the polypeptide chain and the synthesis is completed.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19551180], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt;


[[File:Type I NRPS production of the antibiotic tyrocidine.png|thumb|type I NRPS production of the antibiotic tyrocidine]]

==Domains found in NRPS==
*F: Formylation (optional)
*A: Adenylation (required in a module)
*PCP: Thiolation and Peptide Carrier Protein with attached 4'-phospho-pantetheine (required in a module)
*C: Condensation forming the amide bond (required in a module)
*Cy: Cylization into thiazoline or oxazolines (optional)
*Ox: Oxidation of thiazolines or oxazolines to thiazoles or oxazoles (optional)
*Red: Reduction of thiazolines or oxazolines to thiazolidines or oxazolidines (optional)
*E: Epimerization into D-amino acids (optional)
*NMT: N-methylation (optional)
*TE: Termination by a thio-esterase (only found once in a NRPS)
*R: Reduction to terminal aldehyde or alcohol (optional)

After the peptide chain is synthesized, it can then be modified by halogenation, hydroxylation, acylation or glycosylation, which is typically carried out by an enzyme coded for in the same operon or gene cluster that was associated with the carrier protein. Since NRPS is similar to PKS and FAS, components of the other methods of metabolite synthesis are often cross-linked to each other and combine to form natural products.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I rated the reliability of this page as poor for the following reasons:

1) The page states that life originated 300 million years ago, when in fact multicellular organisms are much much older than that, and dinosaurs were happily roaming the earth by around 250 mya. Most current models put the origin of life at around 3.5 to 4.0 billion years ago.

2) The citations are not complete. The earliest RNA world discussions in the literature, I believe, are found in the following places (maybe I am missing some):

Gilbert, W. (1986) &quot;Origin of life: The RNA world&quot;, Nature 319, 618-618.

Woese, C. R. (1968) The Genetic Code, Harper &amp; Row.

Orgel, L. E. (1968) &quot;Evolution of the genetic apparatus&quot;, J. Mol. Biol. 38, 381-393.

Crick, F. H. (1968) &quot;The origin of the genetic code&quot;, J. Mol. Biol. 38, 367-379.

Rich, A. (1962) On the Problems of Evolution and Biochemical Information Transfer, in Horizons in Biochemistry (Kasha, M., and Pullman, B., Eds.), pp 103–126, New York: Academic.

The Alex Rich citation is a bit obscure because it is a book chapter and is not easy to get. But I have a copy of the book and Alex has a detailed description of an RNA World and even specifically predicts ribozymes. 
&quot;There are specific stereochemical reasons why polynucleotides can act as their own catalysts for self replication&quot; (page 114)
So I believe Alex Rich should be cited in any history of the RNA World hypothesis.

And of course Carl Woese, too.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Electronic waste.jpg|Stockpiled electronic waste|right|250px|thumb]]
[[w:Electronic waste|Electronic waste]] (e-waste) is a term for electronics that have reached the end of their life cycle and are awaiting disposal.  E-waste traditionally encompasses products such as televisions, computers, and cell phones; however, as electronic components become more prevalent in everyday consumer products, the exact definition of e-waste has blurred. &lt;ref&gt;Wong, M. H., Wu, S. C., Deng, W. J., Yu, X. Z., Luo, Q., Leung, A. O. W., et al. (2007). Export of toxic chemicals - A review of the case of uncontrolled electronic-waste recycling RID B-5313-2009. Environmental Pollution, 149(2), 131-140.&lt;/ref&gt; 


E-waste levels have grown drastically in recent years as the average turnover rate of electronics has fallen.  In 2009, the U.S. [[w:Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) found that retailers sold 438 million new consumer electronics in the United States, while 2.37 million tons of electronics qualified for end-of-life management&lt;ref&gt; (2011) Statistics on the Management  of Used and End-of-Life Electronics, EPA [http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/conserve/materials/ecycling/manage.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;.  In the United States, 70% of heavy metals in landfills can be attributed to electronic waste, yet e-waste only accounts for 2-3% of overall municipal waste &lt;ref&gt;http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=earth-talk-recycling-e-equipment&lt;/ref&gt;. Experts project that the severity of the e-waste problem will escalate as demand for electronic consumer goods rises in China and India. Currently, the bulk of the waste originates from developed countries such as the United States and areas of Europe, but it is estimated that waste in China will increase from 1.7 million tons in 2007 to 5.4 million tons in 2015. &lt;ref name=Chi&gt;(Chi, X., Streicher-Porte, M., Wang, M. Y. L., &amp; Reuter, M. A. (2011). Informal electronic waste recycling: A sector review with special focus on china. Waste Management, 31(4), 731-742. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Disposal Methods==

===Responsible E-waste Management===

Proper processing of electronic waste requires that consumers send e-waste to qualified electronics recycling ([[w:e-cycling|e-cycling]]) centers as opposed to disposing of products in traditional trash cans. 

The EPA has established guidelines that dictate appropriate practices for e-waste management. Responsible e-cycling companies typically follow a three-step process.&lt;ref name=EPA&gt; EPA. (2011). ''Regulations/ Standards'' http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/ecycling/rules.htm &lt;/ref&gt; First, any items that are able to be re-used are sent to areas where their life cycle can be extended, such as developing nations. This has a secondary effect of bringing technology to groups who previously may not have had access. Some argue, though, that reuse places electronics products in societies incapable of proper e-cycling, therefore doing more harm than good &lt;ref&gt; http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/the-e-waste-problem/where-does-e-waste-end-up/ &lt;/ref&gt;.

If the product cannot be re-used, human workers and sophisticated machines carefully disassemble the device to collect various recyclable metals. These are re-distributed to manufacturers for inclusion in future products. &lt;ref&gt; Electronics Recyclers International, Inc. (2011). http://electronicrecyclers.com/about_eri.aspx &lt;/ref&gt; This step requires a level of expertise and capital expenditure not currently available in developing nations. Processing centers in these areas employ labor-intensive and more dangerous procedures instead. Finally, any materials that cannot be recycled and pose potential harm are disposed of in a highly regulated manner to avoid environmental and health consequences. &lt;ref name=EPA/&gt; Many responsible e-cyclers have a zero-landfill policy.

===Improper Disposal &amp; Exportation===
[[File:Ewaste-delhi.jpg|E-waste processing in Delhi, India|300px|right]]


The majority of e-waste currently ends up in landfills due to consumers placing their used electronics items in traditional trash management systems. The harmful materials contained within electronics necessitate separate processing from typical waste.

Consumer-recycled e-waste can still pose problems. Although a number of responsible e-cyclers operate worldwide, activist groups such as [[w:Greenpeace|Greenpeace]] and the [[w:Basel Action Network|Basel Action Network]] have questioned the legitimacy of these corporations’ procedures.  These action groups argue that many e-cyclers knowingly ship electronic waste to areas of China, India, and Africa.  Despite being illegal in most of these locations, e-waste shipments are imported by the ton into informal recycling centers, where workers use dangerous techniques to extract valuable metals from old electronics. &lt;ref&gt; &quot;60 Minutes: The Wasteland.&quot; (2009). http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=5274959n&amp;tag=contentBody;storyMediaBox &lt;/ref&gt; Some methods include using acid baths to recover metals, chipping and melting plastics without proper ventilation, removing electronic components from circuit boards over coal-fired grills, and disposing unsalvageable material in fields and riverbanks.&lt;ref&gt; Wong, M. H., Wu, S. C., Deng, W. J., Yu, X. Z., Luo, Q., Leung, A. O. W., . . . Wong, A. S. (2007). Export of toxic chemicals â€“ A review of the case of uncontrolled electronic-waste recycling. Environmental Pollution, 149(2), 131-140. doi:10.1016/j.envpol.2007.01.044 [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026974910700098X]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recyclers use wholesale distribution websites to covertly sell stockpiles of electronic waste to unauthorized overseas recycling operations.  Once a buyer has been secured, large containers are shipped abroad and smuggled past customs officials.  Companies are incentivized to send waste overseas, since lax environmental and labor standards lower the cost of separating out valuable electronic components and disposing of harmful products &lt;ref name=Chi/&gt;.

==Damaging Effects of Improper E-Waste Management==

===Health &amp; Environmental Risks===
Electronics such as cellphones, laptops, TV’s, and batteries all contain materials that are harmful for humans if disposed of improperly. E-waste in landfills can threaten humans through leaching into the soil and groundwater. Lax labor standards in developing nations lead to dangerous working conditions and the direct exposure of processing center workers to hazardous materials.&lt;ref name=Chi/&gt; Some of the compounds in these electronics and their associated risks are as follows:

==E-Cycling Improvement Measures==

Many players in the electronics industry have taken efforts to limit the negative effects of e-waste. Advancements in e-waste management have come from three main areas: consumer awareness, corporate programs, and legislation.

===Increasing Consumer Awareness===

Interest groups have formed to educate consumers on the dangers of improper electronic waste recycling and encourage them not to throw electronics in their typical waste bin. For example, E-cycling Central offers tools such as listings for companies that specialize in e-waste recycling and advertisements for electronics drop-off events.&lt;ref&gt; Telecommunications Industry Association. (2011). ''E-cycling Central''. http://www.ecyclingcentral.com/ &lt;/ref&gt; The Electronics Take-Back Coalition ranks manufacturers recycling efforts and has created a scorecard to raise consumer consciousness and potentially impact buying decisions. &lt;ref name= scorecard&gt; Electronics Take-Back Coalition. (2011). ''Recycling Report Card''. http://www.electronicstakeback.com/hold-manufacturers-accountable/recycling-report-card/ &lt;/ref&gt; The Basel Action Network audits recycling companies through its [[w:e-Stewards|e-Stewards]] program to inform consumers of reputable drop-off centers. &lt;ref&gt; http://e-stewards.org/ &lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate E-Waste Reaction===

In April 2011, the [[w: Consumer Electronics Association|Consumer Electronics Association]] (CEA) released the e-Cycling Leadership Initiative, creating programs to curb the e-waste problem through corporate involvement. The Initiative set the goal of increasing industry-led e-cycling to one billion pounds annually by 2016, a three-fold increase from current levels. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.ecyclingleadershipinitiative.com/principles.html &lt;/ref&gt; Both manufacturers and retailers of electronics have established e-cycling campaigns. The extent of these programs, as well as their success, varies. Many focus on consumer mail-back of products, and some only accept electronics from certain manufacturers. Figure 2 presents a list of programs offered by several well-known corporations.

Some electronics manufacturers have also attempted to reduce the amount of hazardous waste contained in their products. Companies such as Apple, Dell, and Lenovo transitioned to arsenic and mercury-free LCD monitors in 2009. Rechargeable batteries no longer contain a Nickel-Cadmium compound. Lower risk lithium-ion batteries are the new market standard.&lt;ref&gt;http://content.dell.com/us/en/corp/d/corp-comm/earth-greener-products-materials &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apple.com/environment/ &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lenovo.com/social_responsibility/us/en/FY2009_Lenovo_Sustainability_Report.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;




===Legislation===



Lobbying by interest groups such as the Basel Action Network and Greenpeace has led to electronic waste legislation. In 1992, the [[w:Basel Convention|Basel Convention]] of 175 countries produced a treaty that restricted the exportation of electronic waste. The United States, however, was one of three participating countries who did not ratify the treaty. &lt;ref&gt; &quot;About the Basel Convention.&quot; http://www.ban.org/about-the-basel-convention/ &lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the [[w:Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) banned the exportation of certain electronic parts without government permission. The EPA has also funded grants to groups such as the United Nations University to explore more effective ways to manage e-waste. &lt;ref&gt; &quot;As E-waste Piles Up, Disposal Issues Grow.&quot; USA Today. http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2011-06-22-green-tech-recycling_n.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, 25 states have enacted legislative measures of their own. The majority of these laws place the responsibility on electronics manufacturers, stating that they must pay for proper e-cycling of their products. Signed in 2003, the California state law sets a consumer fee, an Advanced Recycling Fee (ARF) on certain electronics that is then redistributed to recycling companies for proper processing. &lt;ref name=state/&gt; In Arkansas, legislation dictates that the state government's Department of Environmental Quality must regulate disposal of electronic goods in landfills. &lt;ref&gt; &quot;Electronics Reuse and Recycling.&quot; (2010) ADEQ. http://www.adeq.state.ar.us/solwaste/branch_recycling/electronics_reuse_and_recycling.htm &lt;/ref&gt; Figure 1 outlines the current legislation in the United States.

==Social Considerations Conflicting with E-waste Problem==
[[File:IPhone 4S Compared to iPhone 3GS.jpg|IPhone 4S compared to iPhone 3GS|250px|left|thumb]]
===&quot;Must-Have Culture&quot; &amp; Planned Obsolescence===

In the United States, consumers have developed a &quot;Must-Have&quot; culture.  This culture is characterized by an insatiable desire for the newest, most advanced technologies. The average American household now owns 24 consumer electronics devices. &lt;ref&gt; eCycling. EPA: http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/ecycling/ &lt;/ref&gt; Despite owning functional units at home, Americans still crave the thinner phones, larger televisions, and faster computers advertised constantly in the media. The willingness to purchase new consumer electronics before the end of a current model's functional life cycle has exacerbated the e-waste epidemic. Psychologists suggest that social phenomena such as the theory of [[w:informational cascades|informational cascades]] may govern the prevalence of consumer electronics fads. &lt;ref&gt; &quot;A Theory of Fads, Fashion, Custom, and Cultural Change as Informational Cascades.&quot; http://www.jstor.org/stable/2138632 &lt;/ref&gt;

A key component of this consumer culture stems from the planned obsolescence strategies of many technology-based corporations. Planned obsolescence is a business strategy wherein companies plan for a limited product life-cycle &lt;ref&gt; http://www.economist.com/node/13354332 &lt;/ref&gt;. By using this strategy, businesses entice consumers into buying a newer version of an old product. While this method can be profitable for businesses, it is a driving force behind rising e-waste levels.

===Ethical Responsibility===
Some consumers and businesses in developed countries feel that it is not their ethical responsibility to worry about the consequences of e-waste in developing nations, citing the economic impact of the industry in these regions.  These opponents argue that informal e-cycling in areas of China and India creates job opportunities otherwise unavailable to local residents, similar to the economic effect of sweatshops in low income countries. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.independent.org/publications/working_papers/article.asp?id=1369 &lt;/ref&gt;  They argue that waste stimulates the economy of those areas, although it may come at the expense of resident and environmental well-being.

===Financial Burden of E-Cycling===

A debate exists surrounding who should bear the financial burden of e-cycling: electronics manufacturers, consumers, or government. Various interest groups have opposed state and federal e-waste legislation, arguing that these efforts are unfairly biased. In July 2009, the Consumer Electronics Association filed a lawsuit against the New York City Government for its passing of an e-waste law. The CEA claimed the law was unconstitutional because it violated due process and manufacturer rights to equal protection under the law. The law required manufacturers to provide free, door-to-door pickup of e-waste from consumers. After an umbrella New York State e-waste law imposed milder regulations, the sides reached a settlement and the court dismissed the case. &lt;ref&gt; Consumer Electronics Association vs. New York City, Retrieved from National Association of Manufacturers: http://lawcenter.nam.org/Results.aspx?P=Consumer%20Electronics%20Association &lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturing companies themselves have also threatened lawsuits against legislation in states such as Washington, complaining that the financial responsibility is unfairly high. &lt;ref&gt; Harbert, Tam. ''Tech industry challenges e-cycling programs''. (2009). http://www.edn.com/article/459217-Tech_industry_challenges_e_cycling_programs.php &lt;/ref&gt; The Reason Foundation, an activist group, claims that imposing e-waste regulations on manufacturers limits the innovation capabilities of these corporations. &lt;ref&gt; Scarlett, L. ''E-waste Politics''. (2000). Reason Foundation: http://reason.org/news/show/e-waste-politics &lt;/ref&gt;

Consumers also struggle with the cost of proper e-cycling. Many refuse to pay recycling fees when they can deposit their e-waste in traditional trash cans at no cost. Government subsidizing of e-cycling has opponents as well, with arguments that the state and federal government system cannot currently afford e-waste management without cutting more valuable programs.

===Lack of Consumer Participation===
The vast number of consumer electronics in households today has left consumers questioning how to discard used electronic goods.  Many simply hold on to their electronic devices instead of disposing of them. Approximately 9% of electronics sold from 1980-2004 in the United States are still in storage awaiting disposal. &lt;ref&gt; Ramzy Kahhat, Junbeum Kim, Ming Xu, Braden Allenby, Eric Williams, Peng Zhang, Exploring e-waste management systems in the United States, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, Volume 52, Issue 7, May 2008, Pages 955-964, ISSN 0921-3449, 10.1016/j.resconrec.2008.03.002. 
(http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344908000360) &lt;/ref&gt; Although the recycling of materials such as plastics, glass, and paper has become commonplace, many do not know that electronics are recyclable goods. In 2010, the recycling rates of newspapers and aluminum cans in the U.S. were 72% and 50% respectively. Meanwhile, only 15% of electronic devices and equipment are recycled. &lt;ref&gt; U.S. EPA. (2010) ''Municipal Solid Waste''. http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/ &lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusion==

Examining e-waste and current e-cycling practices leads to several lessons that apply to many other sociotechnical intersections. One such lesson is that technological advancement can have unintended consequences that bring about social responsibilities. High-tech innovators intended to improve lives through their consumer electronics products, and yet these goods have brought about an e-waste problem with negative health and environmental effects thousands of miles from where their products were used. This creates a complex social responsibility to ensure that proper e-cycling limits the dangers of electronic waste. 

Engineers and technology experts must always consider the full life-cycle of their innovations to avoid these unexpected side effects. Manufacturers can decrease the dangers posed by discarded consumer electronics through reducing the amount of harmful materials contained in these devices. Also, they can extend the life cycle of products and shed planned obsolescence strategies in order to reduce the amount of e-waste. This is generalizable to many cases outside of health and environmental risks from e-waste disposal. Chips and circuits intended for personal computers can become components of third-world land mines, and out-of-use satellites tools for illegitimate armed groups, if their complete life-cycle is not carefully considered and planned. &lt;ref&gt; http://human-rights.unglobalcompact.org/dilemmas/product-misuse/ &lt;/ref&gt;

The web of forces impacting electronic waste demonstrates the inextricable ties between technology and society and reinforces that all stakeholders in technology must not lose sight of the context of their actions. Consumers need to consider whether the &quot;must have&quot; culture propelling their electronics buying decisions is appropriate. Manufacturers, end-users, and government must find an appropriate balance of the financial responsibilities of e-cycling. Awareness of health and environmental concerns posed by e-waste involves education and social activism. Yet all the while, technological changes and improvements can enhance e-cycling efficiency and decrease harmful byproducts. Only when there is mutual adaptation between technology and society can innovation reach its greatest heights.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Nitrogen Fixation, or rather, the fixing of Nitrogen, is a process where N₂ is reduced into NH₃, either biologically or abiotically. The nitrogen in amino acids, pyrimidines, purines and other molecules all come from the N₂ in our atmosphere. The fixing of nitrogen can also be associated with the conversion of nitrogen into other forms, other than ammonia, such as nitrogen dioxide. The triple bond that is present in N₂ is very strong; it has a bond energy of 940 kJ/mol. Yet, it is thermodynamically favorable to form ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen, yet the reaction is still very difficulty kinetically speaking since intermediates can prove to be unstable. It has been estimated that approximately 60 percent of the newly fixed nitrogen on Earth is produced by diazotrophic microorganisms, while lightning and ultraviolet radiation contribute another 15 percent and the rest 25 percent is done by industrial processes.
==Nitrogen Fixation==
The main avenue for entry of nitrogen into the biosphere is nitrogen fixation. In the nitrogen fixation, we basically fix the dinitrogen, or nitrogen gas into ammonia. Also, fixation of nitrogen requires lots of energy because the triple bond of nitrogen gas is stable. However, breaking the triple bond to generate ammonia requires a series of reduction steps involving high input of energy. 
Biologically speaking, the conversion of nitrogen into ammonia is usually done by bacteria and archaea. These organisms that are responsible for nitrogen fixation are called diazotrophic microorganisms. For example, the symbiotic Rhizobium bacteria, a diazotrophic microorganism, goes into the roots of leguminous plants to form root nodules where they fix nitrogen. Other examples include Cyanobacteria, Azotobacteraceae, and Frankia. 
Industrial Processes of Nitrogen Fixation include Dinitrogen complexes, Ambient Nitrogen reduction, and the most common process is the Haber process, invented in 1910. The Haber process involves high pressure, high temperatures, possibly an iron or ruthenium catalyst to produce ammonia.  
Nitrogen Fixation, in the biological sense, is run by an enzyme called nitrogenase. The reason why the nitrogenase complex is used is because it has multiple redox centers. In general though, nitrogenase complex contains two proteins. The first, a reductase, which provides electrons while the second part, nitrogenase, uses these electrons to turn nitrogen into ammonia. The transferring of electrons, from reductase to nitrogenase, in this process is coupled with the hydrolysis of ATP by the reductase.
The reaction for this process is N2 + 8 H+ → 2 NH3 + H2. The reason why this process is an 8 electron process and not simply a 6 electron process is due to the extra mole of Hydrogen that gets generated along with the generation of the ammonia. Often the microorganisms that carry out nitrogen fixation, contain the 8 electrons from the reduced form of Ferredoxin, which can be made from photosynthesis or oxidative processes. Also, this process is coupled by two ATP molecules for each mole, which in turn, equals 16 molecules. The reason for this is not that the ATP hydrolysis is making the reduction thermodynamically favorable since the process is already thermodynamically favorable, but rather allows the reaction to be kinetically possible.
Nitrogen fixing bacteria generally separate anaerobic nitrogen fixation from aerobic metaboism by one of several mechanisms. In the ocean and in the freshwater systems, cyanobacteria are the major nitrogen fixers. Within an ecosystem, nitrogen fixers ultimately make the reduced nitrogen available for assimilation by nonfixing microbes and plants. Besides, nitrogen fixation is extremely energy intensive; thus the rate of fixation usually fails to meet the potential demand of other members of the ecosystem.

      <comment>/* Implications of Technology in Physician-Assisted Suicide */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Physician-assisted suicide in the United States is a controversial issue which has garnered much attention from medicine, law, and many social interest groups.  The influence of technological change on social acceptance and opposition of assisted suicide will be examined in this chapter.  [[w:Jack Kevorkian|Jack Kevorkian]], or &quot;Dr. Death&quot; as he is commonly called, was responsible for elevating the issue of physician-assisted suicide to the national spotlight in the United States.  The career of this polarizing pioneer offers a valuable case study through which the issue will be explored.

=Suicide Case Studies=
==The British Coal-Gas Story==
Throughout generations prior to the 1970s in Great Britain, families heated their homes with coal-gas furnaces. The gas, in its unburned form, released high levels of toxic carbon monoxide. Because of this, 'sticking one's head in the oven,' as it was called, became a preferred method of suicide in England. 

In the 1960s the British government began phasing out coal-gas in favor of the cleaner burning natural gas. By 1971, nearly 70% of the gas reaching consumer households was natural gas. Furthermore, by 1975, the portion of carbon monoxide in the gas entering the average consumer's home was less than one percent. Throughout the 1960s, at the same time that the carbon monoxide was being reduced, the suicide rate dropped in Britain. By 1971, the overall suicide rate for men of all ages had dropped by about 16%.&lt;ref name=&quot;British Coal-Gas Story&quot; /&gt;

Why is that removing one method of self-harm has such a profound rippling effect? Norman Kreitman, in his report on the coal-gas story published in 1976, writes that &quot;There is no shortage of exits from this life; it would seem that anyone bent on self-destruction must eventually succeed, yet it is also quite possible...that a failed attempt serves as a catharsis leading to profound psychological change.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;British Coal-Gas Story&quot;&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov], Kreitman, Norman. (1976). The coal gas story: United Kingdom suicide rates, 1960-71. ''British Journal of Preventive and Social Medicine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==A Tale of Two Bridges==
[[Image:Taft Bridge, Washington.jpg|thumb|The Taft Bridge in Washington, D.C.]]
The [[w:Duke Ellington Bridge|Duke Ellington Bridge]] and the [[w:Taft Bridge|Taft Bridge]] are two bridges in Washington D.C. which both cross over the Rock Creek gorge.  In 1985, the Ellington Bridge accounted for four suicides each year, which was half of all jumping suicides in the city.  The Taft Bridge averaged fewer than two suicides per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Community&quot;&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1943-278X.1994.tb00666.x/full],O'Carroll, P. W., Silverman, M. M. and Berman, A. L. (1994), Community Suicide Prevention: The Effectiveness of Bridge Barriers. Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior, 24: 89–99. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Urge&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/06/magazine/06suicide-t.html?pagewanted=all],Anderson, S. (2008) The Urge to End It All. The New York Times Magazine. &lt;/ref&gt;  This disparity was quite unexpected, considering two important similarities between the two bridges.  First, both bridges stand at approximately 125 feet tall, essentially guaranteeing death as a result of jumping.  This precludes the hypothesis that one bridge was more desirable due to an increased chance of death.  Second, the bridges are located only several hundred yards from each other.  Thus, neither was in a region of a higher general jumping suicide rate than the other.

[[Image:Washington DC Duke Ellington Bridge.jpg|thumb|The Duke Ellington Bridge as seen from the Taft Bridge]]
On a particularly tragic 10-day period in 1985, three people committed suicide by jumping off the Ellington Bridge.  Certain groups of citizens lobbied strongly for the construction of an anti-suicide barrier on the bridge.  Opposition groups like the [[w:National Trust for Historic Preservation|National Trust for Historic Preservation]] claimed that such a barrier would be useless, founding their argument on the assumption that those people intent on committing suicide would simply go elsewhere.  Their argument was strengthened by the fact that the Taft Bridge was just yards away.  The barrier was constructed in January 1986 and completely eliminated suicides at the Ellington Bridge--four deaths per year to zero.&lt;ref name= &quot;Community&quot;/&gt;  The overall suicide rate in Washington dropped by a similar amount.  Meanwhile, the suicide rate on the Taft Bridge saw only a slight increase, from 1.7 deaths per year to 2.&lt;ref name=&quot;Urge&quot;/&gt;

Experts attempted to determine the cause for this phenomenon.  Why had the construction of a barrier on one bridge (of 330 total in Washington) nearly eliminated the four suicides per year for which it was formerly responsible?  They concluded that the initially lower barrier (knee-high) on the Ellington Bridge, relative to that on the Taft Bridge (chest-high), was the primary factor.  Its lack of height offered potentially suicidal people the option to kill themselves quickly and easily in an impulsive moment.  On the other hand, suicide on the Taft Bridge took more time and effort, significantly impeding impulsive suicides.&lt;ref name=&quot;Urge&quot;/&gt;

==Implications==
Both the British coal gas story and the Washington D.C. bridges case imply that the availability of the means to commit suicide can profoundly influence a person's ultimate decision. Studies on other suicide methods have revealed similar implications.  A 2005 international study found a strong correlation between the availability of firearms and firearm suicides.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guns&quot;&gt;[http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2005.075812],Ajdacic-Gross, V., Killias, M., et al. (2005) Changing times: a longitudinal analysis of international firearm suicide data. American Journal of Public Health,  96, 1752–1755.&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar effect was discovered in suicide by pesticide ingestion in developing countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pests&quot;&gt;[http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/6/902.full],Gunnell, D., Eddleston, M.

In the United States, physician-assisted-suicide is legal in Oregon, Washington, and Montana. The processes of applying for physician assisted suicide varies between in each state, and in somes cases the steps can be quite arduous. In all three states, a physician may legally provide a patient with a lethal dose of prescription drugs which the patient is then responsible for taking independently. In this way, the physician is absolved from any liability and the case cannot be labeled as euthanasia.

Oregon was the first state in the United States to legalize physician-assisted-suicide. The [[w:Oregon Death with Dignity Act|Oregon Death with Dignity Act]] (ODWDA) was passed in 1994 amidst strong public support. Under ODWDA, upon first meeting a set of qualifying criteria, a patient may submit a request for a dose of a lethal prescription. The patient must also submit two oral requests to his physician at least 15 days apart from one another.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODDA&quot;&gt;[http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/15325024.asp], Westefield, John S., Doobay, A., Hill, J., Humphreys, C., Sandil, R., &amp; Tallman, B. (2009). The Oregon Death with Dignity Act: The Right to Live or the Right to Die? &quot;Journal of Loss and Trauma&quot;. Vol. 14(3) 161-169.&lt;/ref&gt; The ODWDA has faced numerous legal battles since its enactment in 1994. In 2006, the ODWDA was upheld by the Oregon Supreme Court by a vote of 6-3.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODWDA&quot;&gt;[http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=1073-1105], Sclar, D. (2006).

Oregon Upholds the Oregon Death With Dignity Act. &quot;Journal of Law, Medicine and Ethics.&quot; Vol. 34(3) 639-646.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Washington Death with Dignity Act mirrors that of Oregon and has been active since 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;WDWDA&quot;&gt;[http://www.ajhp.org/], Fass, J. &amp; Fass, A. (2011). Physician-assisted suicide: Ongoing challenges for pharmacists. &quot;American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy.&quot; Vol. 68(9) 846-849.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Unlike the cases of Oregon and Washington where public support led to the enactment of the Death With Dignity Acts, the legality of physician-assisted-suicide in Montana is based on the judicial resolution of a lawsuit, Baxter v. Montana. &lt;ref name=&quot;Montana&quot;&gt;[http://politicsandthelifesciences.org/], Svenson, Arthur G. (2010). Montana's courting of physician aid in dying: Could des moines follow suit?. &quot;Politics and the Life Sciences.&quot; Vol. 29(2) 2-16.&lt;/ref&gt; In this decision, a Montana judge ruled that the right to physician-assisted-suicide was protected by Montana's state constitution.

=Jack Kevorkian=
[[File:KevorkianUCLARoyce.jpg|thumb|left|Dr. Jack Kevorkian]]
[[w:Jack Kevorkian|Dr. Jack Kevorkian]] was trained as a pathologist and publicly demonstrated an unusual interest in death throughout his career.  He published and presented on controversial topics such as medical experimentation on willing capital punishment subjects, blood transfusion from cadavers, and the ethics of euthanasia.  He was dismissed from his residency at the University of Michigan for his discordant opinions and research interests. Kevorkian is best known for his work as a right-to-die activist, assisting in the deaths of over 130 patients throughout the 1990s.

Kevorkian never shied from the public light, insisting on the importance of patient autonomy in the doctor-patient relationship. He once showed up to a court hearing dressed as Thomas Jefferson in a protest that his rights had been violated.&lt;ref name=&quot;kevorkian2&quot;&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek.html], Bai, M. (1998). Death Wish. &quot;Newsweek&quot;. Vol. 132(23).&lt;/ref&gt; 
		 	
Kevorkian's first patient, which received much public scrutiny, was 54-year old Janet Adkins, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;kevorkian&quot;&gt;[http://www.criticalpublichealth.net], Siu, W. (2010). Communities of interpretation: euthanasia and assisted suicide debate. &quot;Critical Public Health.&quot; Vol. 20(2) 169-199.&lt;/ref&gt;Kevorkian required that his patients be terminally ill and consult a pain professional before he would agree to treat them. Kevorkian stated once that he turned away &quot;four out of [every] five&quot; patients that desired his services &lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1006/26/hcsg.01.html]Sanjay Gupta Interview with Dr. Jack Kevorkian Transcript. 26 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Technology==
===Thanatron===
Thanatron, meaning &quot;death machine&quot; in Greek, was the name given Kevorkian gave to his first death machine. It was assembled from spare parts Kevorkian collected at garage sales. Normal saline flowed continuously as the patient initiated administration of a rapidly acting potassium chloride solution to stop the heart.  These are the same drugs used in capital punishment lethal injections.  Kevorkian was forced to discontinue use of the Thanatron in 1991 when he lost his medical license and access to controlled drugs.&lt;ref name=&quot;deathmachines&quot;&gt;[http://www.theatlantic.com], Jackson, Nicholas. (2011). Jack Kevorkian's Death Van and the Tech of Assisted Suicide. &quot;The Atlantic&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mercitron===

Kevorkian invented the Mercitron as a means for assisting patients with suicide after his medical license was revoked. The Mercitron featured a gas mask connected to a tank of carbon monoxide stored in the back of Kevorkian's van. Kevorkian would fit the mask over the patient's mouth and direct the patient's hand to a handle on the device that, when pulled by the patient, would begin the flow of carbon monoxide to the mask. The process could take up to ten minutes before death set in.&lt;ref name=&quot;deathmachines&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;


==Convicted of Murder==
Thomas Youk was a patient of Kevorkian's who suffered from multiple sclerosis. In 1998, Kevorkian assisted in Youk's suicide. In this case, however, the patient was unable to administer the drugs himself, so Kevorkian administered the drugs to Youk. To complicate matters, Kevorkian filmed the entire procedure and sent it to 60 Minutes, taunting the authorities to try him and put him in jail. He was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to jail in 1999 and was not released until 2007. Kevorkian would later disclose that the Youk case was not the first in which he had caused the death of the patient rather than allowing the patient to perform the act on their own. &lt;ref name=&quot;criticalpublichealth&quot;&gt;Siu, W. (2010). Communities of interpretation: euthanasia and assisted suicide debate. &quot;Critical Public Health.&quot; Vol. 20(2) 169-199.&lt;/ref&gt;

=Support=
==Exit International==
Exit International is a registered non-profit group headquartered in Australia dedicated to advancing information and advocating for end-of-life choices. Exit's main goal is enacting legal reform to support physician-assisted-suicide. Exit believes that the Swiss model of PAS is the standard that should be sought after.&lt;ref name=&quot;Exit&quot;&gt;[http://www.exitinternational.net/page/Home?], Exit International.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death with Dignity National Center==
The Death with Dignity National Center is a non-profit organization committed to protecting and preserving the rights established by the Death with Dignity laws in the United States. Additionally, their aim is to extend the Death with Dignity laws protected in Oregon and Washington to states throughout the country. &lt;ref name=&quot;DWDNC&quot;&gt;[http://www.deathwithdignity.org/], Death with Dignity National Center.&lt;/ref&gt;

=Opposition=
==Religious Groups==
Many religious groups are opposed to physician-assisted suicide because they believe that it violates the sanctity of life.  The Christian Medical and Dental Association's position statement conveys the generally pervasive view among conservative faith groups: &quot;We, as Christian physicians and dentists, believe that human life is a gift from God and is sacred because it bears God's image. We oppose active intervention with the intent to produce death for the relief of pain, suffering, or economic considerations, or for the convenience of patient, family, or society.&quot;  Religious groups also commonly propose that the authority of their respective religious figures trumps patient autonomy, disallowing physician-assisted suicide.&lt;ref name=&quot;christian&quot;&gt;[http://www.cmda.org/wcm/CMDA/Issues2/End_of_Life1/Assisted_Suicide_Euthanasia1/Ethics_Statements4/Physician_Assisted_S.aspx],Christian Medical and Dental Association. Physician-Assisted Suicide.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Slippery Slope==
Opponents citing the &quot;slippery slope&quot; argument claim that allowing physician-assisted suicide provides doctors with less motivation to exhaust every alternative option before turning to death.  Others say that there is little if no difference between physician-assisted-suicide and doctor-induced euthanasia. A more extreme proposition made by a journalist opposing legalization of physician-assisted suicide is that the procedures would &quot;become routine&quot; and that &quot;comfort would make us want to extend the option to others who, in society's view, are suffering and leading purposeless lives.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;emanuel&quot;&gt;[http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1997/03/whose-right-to-die/4641/],Emanuel, E. (1997) Whose Right to Die? The Atlantic March 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

=Implications of Technology in Physician-Assisted Suicide=

The bioethics principle of non-maleficence states that a healthcare provider has a duty to do no harm.&lt;ref name=&quot;ethics&quot;&gt;Beauchamp, T., Childress, J. (2001) Principles of Biomedical Ethics Fifth Edition. Oxford University Press:Oxford. 113-157.&lt;/ref&gt; The termination of a person's life to alleviate suffering prior to exhaustive assessment and treatment of the underlying causes of suffering is a violation of this principle.  Reduction of a potential suicide subject's suffering to the point where death is no longer desired is clearly preferable over hasty suicide.  This underlies the arguments of critics who contend that Kevorkian's seemingly swift process may have indicated a neglect for potentially beneficial non-suicide treatments.  Those societies which accept physician-assisted suicide as an ethical medical practice generally do so subject to the condition that the cause of the patient's suffering is untreatable.  In such a case, it is actually inaction which is considered to be malicious towards the patient.  Physician-assisted suicide is justified as a means of reducing suffering in lieu of any other realistic option.

Suicide-enabling technology, including firearms, chemical toxins, and Kevorkian's inventions, has varied consequences, depending on the context of its use.  For example, there may be a case where extreme, incurable suffering renders suicide to be the least malignant course of action.  If law allows physician-assisted suicide, painless suicide techniques clearly offer favorable alternatives to more brutal, potentially painful methods.  However, the existence of more &quot;advanced&quot; suicide technologies can also enable egregious violations of non-maleficence.  As the British coal gas and D.C. bridges case studies showed, available technology can influence and even encourage suicidal behavior.  Thus, the decision to opt for suicide may come hastily and in place of more beneficial treatments.  In other words, the patient may not have chosen such a drastic end if the means were less attractive or available.  Although physician-assisted suicide technology can be beneficial in enabling an escape from suffering, it also has the potential to distort medical decision-making and, at its worst, encourage suicide.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==NMD Introduction==
NMD is a short-handed term for “Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay”. NMD is a mechanism of mRNA surveillance which functioned as detecting nonsense mutations and preventing the expression of reduction or incorrect proteins. 
During RNA translation, the mRNAs can produce abridged proteins carry dominant negative activities. After transcription, mRNA performs a convergence of ribonucleoprotein components first, and then undergoes the regulation of pre-mRNA. As average intro sizes in eukaryotic cells are relatively large, the probability of aberrant mRNA splicing will highly increases. This results in the production of nonsense/stopping codon such as UAA, UAG, and UGA to increase. NMD is then triggered by exon junction complexes, also known as “EJCs”, which are stored during the pre-mRA processing. The presence of EJCs can further promote ribosomal recruitment before the replacement by translation. The EJCs existed in the downstream of a nonsense codon are not performed since the ribosome is reduced from the transcript without reaching it. The remaining EJCs sign of recruitment of UPF1 after the mRNA’s transport away from the nucleus and intro the cytosol, the RNA degrading center. Overall, NMD is considered both a process of degrading truncated mRNA and also a method to regulate normal transcripts’ expression. 


==NMD Factors==
Essential proteins for NMD are: UPF1, UPF2 and UPF3 with the core NMD machinery. For UPF1, proteins including SMG-1, SMG-5, SMG-6 and SMG-7 can intercede the both cycles of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.


==UPF and SMG proteins==
The UPF and SMG proteins are the core machineries for NMD mechanism. 
&lt;br /&gt;Here are some of the proteins and their functions: 
# UPF1: located mainly in cytoplasmic reticulum and some nuclear.  Its functions are promoting translation; histone mRNA decay; ATPase; helicase; phosphoprotein substrate for SMG-1 and requited by eRFs to stop codons; undergoes a cycle of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.
# UPF2: located in cytoplasmic but has nuclear localization signals. It s functions are to promoting translation, EJC adapter protein that binds to both UPF1 and UPF3; binds to RNA in vitro. 
# UPF3: located mainly in nuclear, some in cytoplasmic. Its functions are promoting translation; EJC protein with short and long isoforms that differentially distribute into distinct cytoplasmic protein complexes with UPF1
# SMG-1: located in cytoplasmic. Its functions are phosphoionsitide 3-kinase-related kinase family member; phosphorylates UPF1
# SMG-5: located mainly in cytoplasmic and some nuclear. Its functions are interacting with PP2A and promoting UPF1 dephosphorylation. 
# SMG-6: located mianly in cytoplasmic, and some nuclear. Its functions are interacting with PP2A and promoting UPF1 dephosphorylation.
# SMG-7: located mianly in cytoplasmic, and some nuclear. Its functions are interacting with PP2A and promoting UPF1 dephosphorylation; when over expresses, it recruits UPF1 to P-bodies. 


==Exon-Junction Complex (EJC)==

The Exon Junction Complex (EJC) contains four major proteins: eIF4AIII, MAGOH, MLN51, and Y14. All of the four proteins form the core functions in NMD mechanism such as cross-linking, coimmuno-precipitation, mutation analysis, and RNase H footprinting techniques. The purpose of EJC is to serve as station to attach the transient EJC components, and therefore associate more transiently with the mRNA during its journey from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. 



==NMD during a pioneer round of translation==

NMD during a pioneer round of translation can produce large amount of truncated proteins with deleterious activities. In order to undergo this process, mRNAs are scanned for PTCs and degraded during the early rounds of translation. This method further suggests that mRNAs are scanned either in the nucleus or after entering the cytoplasm when the mRNAs are associated with the nucleus. 

During the pioneer round of translation, NMD occurs when UPF1 interacting with UPF2, which is bound to UPF3.
EJC core, attaching with UPF2 and UPF3, is recruited to exon-exon junctions during mRNA splicing. In an aberrant transcript, at least one EJC deposited downstream of the premature stop codon. It then can interact with UPF1 recruited by CBC and the eukaryotic release factors eRF1 and eRF3. The interaction between UPF1 and
UPF2 is strengthened by CBC when undergoing the pioneer round of translation. In the final step, mRNAs eventually decay. Comparing to a PTC-containing mRNA, a normal mRNA transcript prohibits NMD because the presence of EJC stops codon and further displaced by the ribosome before UPF1 is recruited. After this step, normal transcripts exchange theirs proteins at both 5’ and 3’ ends and proceed to enlarge translation continuously.



==Molecular Interactions that Define Nonsense Codons==

The second signal, such as EJC, is required to define a stop codon as being premature and thus trigger another NMD. Before the mechanism, mRNA is first degraded by NMD. mRNA then undergoes the pioneer round of translation, which leads to the recognition of the stop codon by the eukaryotic release factors eRF1 and eRF3. UPF1 recruits the protein kinase SMG-1, which together with the eRFs forms a transient complex called SURF in third step. For the next step, the SURF complex interacts with an EJC as a requirement for SMG-1 to phosphorylate UPF1. The interaction further triggers the degradation of mRNA, which eventually reduces the release factors and the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits. 



==UPF1 Dephosphorylation, P-Body Recruitment, and mRNA Decay==

After UPF1 is phosphorylated by SMG-1 in the previous step, it further recruits the dephosphorylation. 
Late molecular activity in NMD degrades the mRNA. The phosphorylation of UPF1 recruits the SMG-5/SMG-7 heterodimers and the phosphatase PP2A indicated in the first two steps. P-body recruitment then trigger PP2A to dephosphorylate UPF1. The dephosphotylate UPF1 then releases PP2A and SMG-5/SMG-7 from the mRNP and also decapping, which the mRNA body rapidly decays by 5’ to 3’ exonucleas.



==Recent Study==
Recent researches suggest that mammalian NMD has other uses other than being a linear pathway. All the discoveries of NMD involves the study of EJCs and other independent EJCs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Automobile Repair/99 mercury cougar alternator replacement is a great guide to assist even an experienced DIY mechanic. Please read the original method so to familiarize yourself with all the techniques and steps not laid out in the Alternate. My brother has the '99 Cougar that needed the alternator replaced. We were pleasantly surprised with the Alternate Method stating: This task can also be accomplished WITHOUT removing the drive shafts, or the steering knuckle pinch bolt and separate the ball joint, the &quot;Y&quot;-shaped exhaust pipe. We did need to disconnect the tie rod end from the &quot;A&quot;-shaped suspension arm component. We pulled the cotter pin and removed the castle nut and replaced it castle-up to protect the threads and hit it with a maul to break it loose. I would never state: Jack the car up as high as possible, as if you jack a vehicle to high it becomes unstable. In any case support it properly with jack stands. This may need some investigation to know where and how to jack and place the stands. 4. Remove the serpentine belt from the alternator by relieving tension of the tensioner arm by using a 3/8&quot; square drive ratchet or breaker bar (there is a 3/8&quot; square hole in the arm), release tension on the belt and work the belt off of an accessory. We found the A/C pump to be the easiest to lift off. We think you need two experienced DIYers. There are three bolts on the V6 130 amp alternator, two long shoulder bolts on the two arms and one in the top back of the alternator housing. The top one is just barely visible through the rear exhaust pipe and converter. You can see all three when your hand or tools aren't in the way. And carefully remove the output, heavy Red wire and lug with 10mm, the 3 wire connector with wire bar release and single lamp wire with a plastic clip, before lowering and removing from its home through the fender and suspension area. We were so blessed to find this repair guide. It is my first wiki edit or discussion. So comments are welcome.

      <text xml:space="preserve">====2.1 Structure====
----

'''2.1.1 Distinguish between biotic and abiotic (physical) components of an ecosystem'''
:* Biotic: All the plants, animals, algae, fungi and microbes in an ecosystem (All living things)
:* Abiotic: The chemical and physical factors in an ecosystem (non living) for example: Temperature, moisture, salinity, soil type, light, air.
      Both biotic and abiotic interact between each others to sustain the ecosystem.

'''2.1.2 Define the term trophic level.'''
:*The position that an organism occupies in a food chain, or a group of organisms in a community that occupy the same position in food chains.

'''2.1.3 Identify and explain trophic levels in food chains and food webs selected from the local environment.'''

'''2.1.4 Explain the principles of pyramids of numbers, pyramids of biomass, and pyramids of productivity, and construct such pyramids from given''' '''data.'''

Pyramids are graphical models of the quantitative differences that exist between the trophic levels of a single ecosystem. A pyramid of biomass represents the standing stock of each trophic level measured in units such as grams of biomass per square metre (g m–2). Biomass may also be measured in units of energy, such as J m–2. In accordance with the second law of thermodynamics, there is a tendency for numbers and quantities of biomass and energy to decrease along food chains; therefore the pyramids become narrower as one ascends. Pyramids of numbers can sometimes display different patterns, for example, when individuals at lower trophic levels are relatively large. Similarly, pyramids of biomass can show greater quantities at higher trophic levels because they represent the biomass present at a given time (there may be marked seasonal variations). Both pyramids of numbers and pyramids of biomass represent storages.Pyramids of productivity refer to the flow of 
energy through a trophic level and invariably show a decrease along the food chain. For example, the turnover of two retail outlets cannot be compared by simply comparing the goods displayed on the shelves; the rates at which the shelves are being stocked and the goods sold 
also need to be known. Similarly, a business may have substantial assets but cash flow may be very limited. In the same way, pyramids of biomass simply represent the momentary stock, whereas pyramids of productivity show the rate at which that stock is being generated. Biomass, measured in units of mass or energy (for example, g m–2 or J m–2), should be distinguished from productivity measured in units of flow (for example, g m–2yr–1or J m–2yr–1). A pyramid of energy may be represented either as the standing stock (biomass) measured in units of energy 
(J m–2) or as productivity measured in units of flow of energy (J m–2yr–1), depending on the text consulted. As this is confusing, this 
syllabus avoids the term pyramid of energy.

'''2.1.5 Discuss how the pyramid structure affects the functioning of an ecosystem.'''
:* Because energy is lost through food chains, carnivores are at risk from disturbance.
:* Disturbance at the lowest level (producers) directly affects the existence of species at consumer level and ultimately the top carnivores.

'''2.1.6 Define the terms species, population, habitat, niche, community and ecosystem with reference to local examples.'''
:*Species: A group of organisms that interbreed and produce fertile offspring.
:*Population: A group of organisms of the same species living in the same area at the same time, and which are capable of interbreeding.
:*Habitat: The environment in which a species normally lives.
:*Niche: A species’ share of a habitat and the resources in it. An organism’s ecological niche depends not only on where it lives but also on what it does.
:*Community: A group of populations living and interacting with each other in a common habitat.
:*Ecosystem: A community of interdependent organisms and the physical environment they inhabit.

'''2.1.7 Describe and explain population interactions using examples of named species.'''

:* Competition: Interspecific (between species) and intraspecific (within species) FOR RESOURCES: Space, Water, Food, Sunlight, Mates
:* Predation: Ex) Lynx and Snowshoe have (negative feedback mechanisms. Carnivores of any level eating organism of other species. 
:* Symbiosis: Where two organisms live together.
:* Parasitism: Ectoparasites... Ex) Ticks, Fleas, Leaches. Endoparasites.... Ex) Tapeworms
:* Mutualism: Live together, both benefit.... Ex) clown fish and sea anemone
:* Commensalism: Where one animal benefits but nothing happens to the other.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Elizabeth Neufeld is most notable for her work in advances in treatment for genetically inherited diseases such as Hurler's, Hunter's, and Sanfilippo syndrome. She was born in Paris and later moved with her family to New York in 1940. She was a research assistant for Elizabeth Russell at Jackson Memorial Laboratory, and shortly attended the University of Rochester for her masters until her father passed a way. After getting married she found a technician position available in the department of biology at Johns Hopkins. She later enrolled in the graduate program at UC Berkeley in Comparative Biochemistry. 

As her career developed she eventually studied Hurler's syndrome, an autosomal recessive inherited disease resulting in a multitude of effects including progressive mental retardation and leading to death by about age 10. The biological problem that occurs in those with Hurler's syndrome was known to be associated with the storage and excretion of mucopolysaccharides, though the specifics had yet to be determined. Patients fibroblasts, synthesizing cells found in connective tissue, showed irregular accumulation of mucopolysaccharides. At first Neufeld thought it to be a problem of overproduction, though her experiments revealed that it was in fact a result of insufficient degradation. 

After Danes and Bearn published a paper postulating that normal cells assist mutant cells with mucopolysaccharide degradation, Neufeld's partner had a mix up in Hunter's and Hurler's cells in the lab. Keeping this plate with the mixed cells, he and Neufeld discovered that the cells in fact underwent some normalization! The cells appeared to be secreting 'corrective factors' in mixtures of different genotypes. The corrective factor was found to be α-L-iduronidase. Hurler factor has α-L-iduronidase activity, but it is deficient. While Neufeld's group was looking for the uptake signal, a researched named Sly found that mannose-6-phosphate was the recognition signal for lysosomal enzymes while studying a disease with β-glucuronidase deficiency--another mucopolysaccharide storage disease. 

With these key pieces of knowledge, Neufeld and fellow researches sought therapy for those with Hurler's syndrome. Meanwhile, Robert Shull who found signs of lysosomal storage diseases in a Plott hound, sent Neufeld fibroblasts which ended up being α-L-iduronidase deficient. Shull then started a colony of this dog to understand more about this disease, and created an animal model for enzyme replacement therapy. Using cDNA of α-L-iduronidase, Neufeld teamed up with Emil Kakkis and used Chinese hamster ovary cells to make recombinant human and canine DNA, which successfully excreted the enzyme with the M6P signal and was highly corrective! This cDNA was used in α-L-iduronidase deficient dogs and found to be effective! After short and long term trials with dogs, then 55 human trials, the FDA approved the treatment in 2003 for Hurler's syndrome. It was later approved for other mucopolysaccharide storage diseases.

Neufeld spent 35 years of her life developing a treatment for the rare lysosomal enzyme disease. Thanks to her, enzyme replacement therapy for alpha-L-Iduronidase deficiency is now an acceptable treatment. Using the mannose 6-phosphate system, the therapy is now being used to treat Hunter and the Maroteaux-Lamy syndromes.

Despite the acceptability of enzyme replacement therapy, there are still many issues. One major issue is that this is a highly expensive treatment, both for administration, and for further research. Another major restriction in this treatment is that not all of the human body is equally receptive to the new enzymes. For example, especially in the central system, intravenously injected enzymes are blocked by the blood-brain barrier. This is rather unfortunate as many patients with mucopolysaccharide storage diseases have neurologic variations. Though research has been done for alternative administration methods, and other possible pharmaceuticals to correct the enzyme misfolding, as of right now, only the alternative administrations have been brought to clinical trials. Thus it may be many years before the problem is fully solved.

Tranplantation of hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow or cord blood may be another therapy for Hurler syndrome, but it is still a risky procedure. Additionally, it is thought that there might be a &quot;takeover&quot; with the donor's cells gradually replacing the patient's cells.&lt;ref&gt;Neufeld EF. From Serendipity to Therapy. Annu Rev Biochem 2011;80:1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since her successful efforts in therapy for Hurler's syndrome, Neufeld has received the Javits Award for her work on Tay-Sachs disease, and is now interested in Sanfiippo Syndrome. Each type of Sanfilippo syndrome has a lysosomal enzyme deficiency, and Neufeld discovered the syndrome to be a tauopathic disease-- a group of neurodegenerative diseases which all lead to dementia. 
She found that the expression of many mRNAs changed in the experiments, the mRNA encoding lysozyme stood out as it was elevated over 6 times the normal in both the affected and control areas in MPS IIIB mice. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the lysozyme protein was elevated only in the medial entorhinal cortex. Lysozymes have been studied for a long time, and in fact was one of the first enzymes to be studied, and was discovered to be a product of phagocytes an epithelial cells by Alexander Fleming. However, it had not yet been described in neurons. Neufeld proposed that the elevated levels of the lysozyme in the medial entorhinal cortex could induce hyperphosphorylated tau.&lt;ref&gt;Neufeld EF. From Serendipity to Therapy. Annu Rev Biochem 2011;80:1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;


Neufeld hopes that research into Alzheimer's (another disease in the tauopathy family) will also lead to advancements in understanding and treating Sanfilippo Syndrome.

[[Image:Brassica campestris var. chinensis Unknown vegetable dsc07327.jpg|thumb|right|Pak Choi (Chinese Celery).]]
'''Bok choy''' (Cantonese) (also: '''bok choi''', '''baicai''' (Mandarin, 白菜, báicài, literally white vegetable), '''pak choi''' and '''pak choy''' and sometimes ambiguously known as '''Chinese leaves''' and has been planted in China for more than 5,000 years.) its origin is from China, but it is also grown now in California and parts of Canada. It takes about two months from planting to harvesting Bok choy in milder weather.

Bok choy is a green leafy vegetable used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|Chinese]] and [[Cookbook:Southeast Asian cuisines|South-east Asian cooking]]. It has a firm white stem, dark green leaves, and a faintly bitter taste. Since the shape of bok choy’s leaves is like spoon, it is also called “soup spoon”. There are a number of different related varieties, some of which have green stems and lighter-green leaves, which looks like white cabbage, and is also different from [[w:Napa cabbage|Napa cabbage]]. The bok choy varies in color, taste, and size such as tah tsai and joi choi. Even though bok choy is similar to celery, it is actually a member of the [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]] family (''[[Cookbook:Brassicas|brassica]] chinensis'', or ''[[Cookbook:Brassicas|brassica]] campestris, Chinensis group'').

Unlike a western cabbage, the heads are very loose and fan outward instead of close in on themselves. Both the stems and leaves can be used, but the stems take a little longer to cook (though still very little time). Bok choy is used after washing it carefully with the separation of the leaves and the stalks to make sure they are completely clean. It has a mild flavor that permits it to be eaten raw in a salad if the leaves are very small (Baby bok choy), [[Cookbook:Steaming|steamed]], [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir-fried]] or even [[Cookbook:Deep-Frying|deep-fryed]], braising, [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiled]] and in soups.

Bok choy can be fresh in the refrigerator for up to six days without washing. So, only wash it as needed. The veggie is fulled with vitamins A and C. One cup of cooked it offers more than 100% of the recommend dietary allowance of A, and close to two-thirds the RDA of C.

When substitution is required, a mixture of [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]] and [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]] will often work well.

Bok choy is related to:

*[[Cookbook:Choy Sum|choy sum]] - 1&quot;-wide stalks with some vertical spacing, less bitter, less likely to be damaged due to smaller size
*[[Cookbook:Yu Choy|yu choy]] - 0.4&quot;-diameter branching stems, rarely sold, may include flowers
*[[Cookbook:Nappa Cabbage|Chinese cabbage]] - tight head (''Pekinensis'' group), very common

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Loratadine ==

(C22H23CIN2O2) is generally known as Claritin, an over the counter drug. It often comes in a white to off-white powder form. It is not soluble in water, but very soluble in acetone, alcohol, and chloroform. It is called ethyl 4-(8-chloro-5,6-dihydro-11H-benzo[5,6]cyclohepta[1,2-b]pyridin-11-ylidene) -1-piperidinecarboxylate, with a molecular weight of 382.89g. 

In tablet form, it contains ingredients other than loratadine and antihistamines, which are inactive ingredients such as corn starch, lactose, and magnesium stearate.
In Syrup form, it also contains loratadine and antihistamine, but also includes other inactive ingredients such as citric acid, edetate disodium, artificial flavor, glycerin, propylene glycol, sodium ben-zoztem and water. It's pH is around 2.5 -3.1.

Loratadine is used to relive allergy symptoms caused by dust, pollen, and other substances. Loratadine is in the drug class called antihistamines and blocks the histamines on H1 receptors from working and causing allergic symptoms in the body. Common allergy symptoms include but are not limited to sneezing, itching, and runny nose. Loratadine is a second-generation histamine H1 receptor antagonist because it does not have a sedative side effective. Loratadine comes in 4 different forms: liquid, oral suspension, immediate or extended release tablet, and orally disintegrating tablet. Loratadine can also be combined with pseudophedrine. When taken orally, loratadine is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and metabolized by cytochrom P450 before binding to plasma membrane proteins. 

Although loratadine is considered a ‘non-sedating’ antihistamine, dose-related sedation has been noted. For this reason, it would be prudent to monitor for drowsiness when used concurrently with other CNS depressants such as barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opiate agonists, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, ethanol, other H1-blockers, and anxiolytics, sedatives, and hypnotics.

===== Loratadine Pharmacokinetics =====

[[File:CYP3A4.png|thumb|CYP3A4]]

In vitro studies, loratadine is metabolized to descarboethoxyloratadine mainly by CYP3A4, and some by cytochrome CYP2D6. CYP3A4 inhibitor, loratadine is metabolized to descarboethoxyloratadine mainly by CYP2D6. Ketoconazole, erythromycin(both CYP3A4 inhibitors), or cimetidine (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitor) increases plasma concentration of loratadine. The half life of loratadine is about ~8.4 hours and its metabolite is ~28 hours. Elimination occurs through the fecal and renal routes. 

===== Loratadine is also a substrate for P-glycoprotein transport. =====
Cimetidine, erythromycin, nefazodone and ketoconazole have been shown to interfere with the metabolism of loratadine. the inhibition of P-450 CYP3A4 isozyme lead to increasing serum concentrations of loratadine and its metabolite. Increased level of loratadine serum concentrations do not result in significant differences in adverse reactions compare to control patients. However, it is important to be caution of using loratadine with other drug combination in the concurrent risk for arrhythmogenic events.  Although the drug interaction have not been confirmed between loratadine and cytocrome P-450, it is need to be are of potent CYP3A4 due to the serious nature of interactions between these drugs and certain other H1-antagonists.

==Side effects==
Some people have allergic reactions when this drug is ingested. Some serious side effects include:
* fast and uneven heart rate
* jaundice (yellow skin or eyes)
* seizures
* feelings of passing out

People can be mildly allergic and present following symptoms that are not as severe:
* headache
* nausea
* nervousness
* drowsiness
* stomach pain, diarrhea
* dry mouth
* sore throat

It is recommended for people to contact the doctor immediately if they present any of the serious symptoms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:OpenGL Tutorial Text 01.png|thumb|Basic text]]

= Introduction =

It is very likely that at one point you will want to draw text with OpenGL.
It may seem like a very basic functionality of any drawing API, but you will not find any function in OpenGL that deals with text.
There are good reasons for that: text is much more complicated than you think.
If you are American and use a fixed-width font, then life is simple. You don't have more than 128 possible characters to think about, and they are all the same size.
If you have a proportional-width font, things are already getting more difficult.
If you are European, then 256 characters might be just enough for one language, but it is already impossible to represent all European languages with that.
If you include the rest of the world, then you need more than 65536 (16-bit) characters,
and text might need to be rendered from right to left or from top to bottom, and you might have to use other techniques than just drawing characters next to each other on the screen to produce something intelligible.
Related to text rendering, you might also want to render mathematical equations, Feynman diagrams, chess board diagrams or sheet music.
I hope you are convinced now that text rendering is a very high-level function, that has no place in a low-level graphics API such as OpenGL.

That said, we still want to draw text with OpenGL.
There are various ways to do this:

* Draw letter shapes using GL_LINES.
* Draw filled letter shapes using GL_TRIANGLES.
* Draw real 3D letters.
* Draw letters using textured quads.
* Draw complete sentences or paragraphs using a textured quads.
* Draw text directly to the framebuffer with glDrawPixels() (not available in OpenGL ES 2.0).

In this tutorial, we will start with rendering very simple (US-ASCII) text using one textured quad per letter, or in font terminology, &quot;glyphs&quot;.
This technique is quite flexible, and if you are able to cache textures properly, it is also one of the fastest ways to render text.
With a little care, the visual quality of the text is as good as the text rendered by your browser or word processor.

= The FreeType library =

In order to draw text, we will need some way to read a font,
and have it converted into a format that we can use with OpenGL.
Many operating systems have a standard way to read fonts,
but there are also many libraries that can do this.
A very good, well-known, cross-platform library is [http://www.freetype.org/ FreeType].
It supports a lot of font formats, including [[w:TrueType|TrueType]] and [[w:OpenType|OpenType]].

With FreeType, you can look up characters, query their dimensions, find out how to position them more or less correctly, and most importantly, provides you with a greyscale image of any character.
This is exactly the functionality that we need for the text drawing method that we will use in this tutorial.

While FreeType allows you to access font data, it is not a text layout engine.
That means it will not render whole lines of text or paragraphs for you.
It also cannot automatically render [[w:diacritic|diacritics]], automatically use [[w:typographic ligatures|ligatures]] or reproduce other [[w:complex text layout|complex typographic features]].
If you need this functionality,
you should use a text layout library such as [http://www.pango.org/ Pango],
and draw a whole text at a time instead of a character at a time.
This can use more memory and will certainly be slower when dynamically changing text is drawn.

Using FreeType is quite simple. The following two lines should be added to the top of the source code to include the right headers:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;ft2build.h&gt;
#include FT_FREETYPE_H
&lt;/source&gt;

Before using any other FreeType function, we need to initialize the library:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
FT_Library ft;

if(FT_Init_FreeType(&amp;ft)) {
  fprintf(stderr, &quot;Could not init freetype library\n&quot;);
  return 1;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

= Fonts and Glyphs =

The term [[w:font|font]] can have different meanings,
but generally we think of &quot;Times New Roman&quot; or &quot;Helvetica&quot; as fonts.
We also make a distinction between regular, &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt;, and other styles,
so &quot;Helvetica Bold&quot; is a different font than &quot;Helvetica Italic&quot;.
If you use the FreeType library,
you have to specify the full filename of the file containing the font you want to render text with.
In FreeType, this is called a &quot;face&quot;.
For example, to load the regular FreeSans font from the current directory, we use:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
FT_Face face;

if(FT_New_Face(ft, &quot;FreeSans.ttf&quot;, 0, &amp;face)) {
  fprintf(stderr, &quot;Could not open font\n&quot;);
  return 1;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

After we have loaded the face, we basically have only one parameter we can adjust,
and that is the font size. To set it to a height of 48 pixels, we use:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
FT_Set_Pixel_Sizes(face, 0, 48);
&lt;/source&gt;

A face is basically a collection of [[w:glyph|glyphs]].
A glyph is usually a single character,
but it can also be a diacritic or a ligature.
A font can also contain more than one glyph for the same character,
providing alternative renderings. (See for example the list of features of the excellent [http://www.linuxlibertine.org/index.php?id=87&amp;L=1 Linux Libertine] font.)
Even [[w:unicode|Unicode characters]] do not necessarily have a one-to-one mapping to font glyphs.
We will forget about all this complexity though,
and focus on the good old [[w:ASCII|ASCII]] character set.
For example, to get the glyph for the character &quot;X&quot; from the font,
we use the following code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
if(FT_Load_Char(face, 'X', FT_LOAD_RENDER)) {
  fprintf(stderr, &quot;Could not load character 'X'\n&quot;);
  return 1;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;FT_Load_Char()&lt;/code&gt; function will fill store all the information of that character into the face's &quot;glyph slot&quot;, which can be accessed through &lt;code&gt;face-&gt;glyph&lt;/code&gt;.
Because we specified &lt;code&gt;FT_LOAD_RENDER&lt;/code&gt;, FreeType will also have created an 8-bit greyscale image that can be accessed via &lt;code&gt;face-&gt;glyph-&gt;bitmap&lt;/code&gt;.
Because it is tedious to write &lt;code&gt;face-&gt;glyph&lt;/code&gt; all the time, and because the pointer &lt;code&gt;face-&gt;glyph&lt;/code&gt; never changes, we will define the following variable as a shortcut:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
FT_GlyphSlot g = face-&gt;glyph;
&lt;/source&gt;

We will use the following information in this tutorial:

; g-&gt;bitmap.buffer : Pointer to the 8-bit greyscale image of the glyph, rendered at the previously selected font size.
; g-&gt;bitmap.width : Width of the bitmap, in pixels.
; g-&gt;bitmap.rows : Height of the bitmap, in pixels.
; g-&gt;bitmap_left : Horizontal position relative to the cursor, in pixels.
; g-&gt;bitmap_top : Vertical position relative to the baseline, in pixels.
; g-&gt;advance.x : How far to move the cursor horizontally for the next character, in 1/64 pixels.
; g-&gt;advance.y : How far to move the cursor vertically for the next character, in 1/64 pixels, almost always 0.

Why all these values? The reason is that not every glyph has the same size.
FreeType renders an image that is just large enough to contain the visible parts of the character.
That means a period &quot;.&quot; has only a very small bitmap, and the &quot;X&quot; will have a large bitmap.
This is why it is important to know the width and height of the bitmap.
The comma &quot;,&quot; and apostrophe &quot;'&quot; might be rendered as the same bitmap,
but the position relative to the baseline is very different.
The &quot;X&quot; character starts at the baseline but extends to very high above it, while the &quot;p&quot; character doesn't go that high but dips below the baseline.
These things make it necessary to know the offset of the bitmap relative to the cursor and baseline.
Furthermore, the visible size of a character does not necessarily tell you how far to move the cursor for the next character. Think for example about the space character!

= Shaders =

For text rendering, we can usually settle for very basic shaders.
Since text is basically two-dimensional,
we could use an attribute vec2 for vertices, and another attribute vec2 for texture coordinates.
But it is also possible to combine the vertex and texture coordinates into a single four-dimensional vector, and have the vertex shader split it in two:

&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
#version 120

attribute vec4 coord;
varying vec2 texcoord;

void main(void) {
  gl_Position = vec4(coord.xy, 0, 1);
  texcoord = coord.zw;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Although this might not be directly obvious,
the best way to draw text is to use a texture that contains only alpha values.
The RGB color itself is set to the same value for all the pixels.
Where the alpha value is 1 (opaque), the font color is drawn.
Where it is 0 (transparent), the background color is drawn.
Where the alpha value is between 0 and 1, the background color is allowed to mix with the font color.
The fragment shader is as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
#version 120

varying vec2 texcoord;
uniform sampler2D tex;
uniform vec4 color;

void main(void) {
  gl_FragColor = vec4(1, 1, 1, texture2D(tex, texcoord).a) * color;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Although one could also have written &lt;code&gt;vec4(color.rgb, texture2D(tex, texcoord).a)&lt;/code&gt;,
this fragment shader allows us to render transparent text.
The fragment shader should be used in combination with blending:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
glEnable(GL_BLEND);
glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA);
&lt;/source&gt;

= Rendering lines of text =

Before we can start rendering text, there are still some things that need initialization.
First, we will use a single texture object to render all the glyphs:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
GLuint tex;
glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0);
glGenTextures(1, &amp;tex);
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, tex);
glUniform1i(uniform_tex, 0);
&lt;/source&gt;

To prevent certain artifacts when a character is not rendered exactly on pixel boundaries,
we should clamp the texture at the edges, and enable linear interpolation:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S, GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE);
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE);

glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_LINEAR);
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, GL_LINEAR);
&lt;/source&gt;

It is also very important to disable the default 4-byte alignment restrictions that OpenGL uses
for uploading textures and other data.
Normally you won't be affected by this restriction, as most textures have a width that is a multiple of 4, and/or use 4 bytes per pixel.
The glyph images are in a 1-byte greyscale format though, and can have any possible width.
To ensure there are no alignment restrictions, we have to use this line:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
glPixelStorei(GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, 1);
&lt;/source&gt;

We also need to set up a vertex buffer object for our combined vertex and texture coordinates:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
GLuint vbo;
glGenBuffers(1, &amp;vbo);
glEnableVertexAttribArray(attribute_coord);
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo);
glVertexAttribPointer(attribute_coord, 4, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, 0);
&lt;/source&gt;

We now have everything in place to render a line of text.
The recipe we will use is simple.
We start with a certain baseline (vertical) and cursor (horizontal) position,
load the first character, upload it as a texture, draw it at the correct offset from the starting position,
and then move the cursor to the next position.
We repeat this for all the characters in the line.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
void render_text(const char *text, float x, float y, float sx, float sy) {
  const char *p;

  for(p = text; *p; p++) {
    if(FT_Load_Char(face, *p, FT_LOAD_RENDER))
        continue;
 
    glTexImage2D(
      GL_TEXTURE_2D,
      0,
      GL_ALPHA,
      g-&gt;bitmap.width,
      g-&gt;bitmap.rows,
      0,
      GL_ALPHA,
      GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE,
      g-&gt;bitmap.buffer
    );
 
    float x2 = x + g-&gt;bitmap_left * sx;
    float y2 = -y - g-&gt;bitmap_top * sy;
    float w = g-&gt;bitmap.width * sx;
    float h = g-&gt;bitmap.rows * sy;
 
    GLfloat box[4][4] = {
        {x2,     -y2    , 0, 0},
        {x2 + w, -y2    , 1, 0},
        {x2,     -y2 - h, 0, 1},
        {x2 + w, -y2 - h, 1, 1},
    };
 
    glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof box, box, GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW);
    glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, 0, 4);
 
    x += (g-&gt;advance.x &gt;&gt; 6) * sx;
    y += (g-&gt;advance.y &gt;&gt; 6) * sy;
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The function &lt;code&gt;render_text()&lt;/code&gt; takes 5 arguments: the string to render, the x and y start coordinates, and the x and y scale parameters.
The last two should be chosen such that one glyph pixel corresponds to one screen pixel.
Let's look at the &lt;code&gt;display()&lt;/code&gt; function which draws the whole screen:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
void display() {
  glClearColor(1, 1, 1, 1);
  glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

  GLfloat black[4] = {0, 0, 0, 1};
  glUniform4fv(uniform_color, 1, black);

  float sx = 2.0 / glutGet(GLUT_WINDOW_WIDTH);
  float sy = 2.0 / glutGet(GLUT_WINDOW_HEIGHT);

  render_text(&quot;The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog&quot;,
              -1 + 8 * sx,   1 - 50 * sy,    sx, sy);
  render_text(&quot;The Misaligned Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog&quot;,
              -1 + 8.5 * sx, 1 - 100.5 * sy, sx, sy);

  glutSwapBuffers();
}
&lt;/source&gt;

We start by clearing the screen to white, and setting the font color to black.
Since we are not using any transformation matrix,
we can simply calculate the scaling factors by dividing 2 by the screen's width and height.
The first line (a well-known [[w:pangram|pangram]]) is aligned exactly to pixel coordinates.
The second line is deliberately misaligned by half a pixel in each direction.
The difference is obvious; the second line looks more fuzzy and some ugly artifacts are visible.

You might naively think that it would be better to have textures that are twice or more times bigger than how you draw them, so that OpenGL does the anti-aliasing.
Unless you use multi-sampling or FSAA, this is not what will happen.
It will always be better to have FreeType render the font at the right size,
and render it correctly aligned.
To illustrate, let's draw the 48 point font scaled down 2 and 4 times,
and compare that to &quot;unscaled&quot; 24 and 12 point font sizes.
Add the following to the &lt;code&gt;display()&lt;/code&gt; function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  FT_Set_Pixel_Sizes(face, 0, 48);
  render_text(&quot;The Small Texture Scaled Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog&quot;,
              -1 + 8 * sx,   1 - 175 * sy,   sx * 0.5, sy * 0.5);
  FT_Set_Pixel_Sizes(face, 0, 24);
  render_text(&quot;The Small Font Sized Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog&quot;,
              -1 + 8 * sx,   1 - 200 * sy,   sx, sy);
  FT_Set_Pixel_Sizes(face, 0, 48);
  render_text(&quot;The Tiny Texture Scaled Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog&quot;,
              -1 + 8 * sx,   1 - 235 * sy,   sx * 0.25, sy * 0.25);
  FT_Set_Pixel_Sizes(face, 0, 12);
  render_text(&quot;The Tiny Font Sized Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog&quot;,
              -1 + 8 * sx,   1 - 250 * sy,   sx, sy);
&lt;/source&gt;

You should see that despite the linear texture interpolation of OpenGL,
the quality of the downscaled text is worse than the unscaled text.
There are several reasons for this.
First is that by scaling the text, you are letting OpenGL anti-alias an already anti-aliased glyph image.
Second, linear texture interpolation uses a weighted average of at most four texture elements,
and is not really the same as calculating the average of a 2x2 or 4x4 region from the texture.
Last but not least, the FreeType library will by default apply [[w:Font hinting|hinting]] to improve the contrast of the characters.
The effect of hinting is lost when the pixels of the hinted glyph image are not mapped on-to-one to screen pixels.

Rendering colored and/or transparent text is easy,
we just change the uniform color to our liking:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  FT_Set_Pixel_Sizes(face, 0, 48);
  render_text(&quot;The Solid Black Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog&quot;,
              -1 + 8 * sx,   1 - 430 * sy,   sx, sy);

  GLfloat red[4] = {1, 0, 0, 1};
  glUniform4fv(uniform_color, 1, red);
  render_text(&quot;The Solid Red Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog&quot;,
              -1 + 8 * sx,   1 - 330 * sy,   sx, sy);
  render_text(&quot;The Solid Red Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog&quot;,
              -1 + 28 * sx,  1 - 450 * sy,   sx, sy);

  GLfloat transparent_green[4] = {0, 1, 0, 0.5};
  glUniform4fv(uniform_color, 1, transparent_green);
  render_text(&quot;The Transparent Green Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog&quot;,
              -1 + 8 * sx,   1 - 380 * sy,   sx, sy);
  render_text(&quot;The Transparent Green Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog&quot;,
              -1 + 18 * sx,  1 - 440 * sy,   sx, sy);
&lt;/source&gt;

Exercises:
* Try changing the background color.
* Try using GL_LUMINANCE and GL_INTENSITY instead of GL_ALPHA.
* Try changing the blending to &lt;code&gt;glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ZERO)&lt;/code&gt;.
* Try removing the call to &lt;code&gt;glPixelStorei()&lt;/code&gt;.
* Try different texture wrapping and interpolation modes.
* Try drawing the text &lt;code&gt;&quot;First line\nSecond line&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. What happened?
* Draw the baselines and cursors for every character.
* Add a transformation matrix and use it to rotate the text by 30 degrees.
* Use a perspective transformation matrix, and look at the text from an oblique angle.

Your recent edits to this page have been reverted because you removed a large amount of text and gave no reason for such removal.  Please always add an edit summary so that other editors can understand what you are doing.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:02, 4 December 2011 (UTC)

: Thank you for your quick reply to my message.  I have restored all of your previous edits.  The problem is that it is not ''all your own work''.  There are other contributors to this book including [[User:Mcordovez]] and [[User:Econnell]] and on Wikibooks all books are editable by anybody.  Do not expect your work to remain as it is because anybody can edit the pages if they wish.  Regular users of Wikibooks patrol recent changes looking for vandalism and non-constructive editing and large removals of text are considered to be non-constructive especially if the editor hasn't said why they are making such changes.  When you edit any page you will see a field at the bottom (between the text and the ''Save page'' button) titled ''Edit Summary''.  User this field to explain any changes you are making as this will help other editors.  I hope this is clear.  Once again I am sorry that your edits were removed. --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:26, 4 December 2011 (UTC)

:Now I feel really bad. I didn't mean to be so snippy, just heat of the moment at the thought of all my work being gone. Mcordovez and econnell are my partners in a group project so it seemed strange that we wouldn't have exclusive editing power until we turned it over to the wiki community. I guess thats not how it works. I'll make sure to explain future edits. If you have any time, please feel free to suggest some areas of improvement for the content of our work-in-progress page.
: Don't worry.  Any changes can be undone here using the 'History' tab at the top of the page.  Yes, other users can edit your pages but Wikibooks is a fairly quiet community so very few people will edit your work generally.  Some people may come along and add a few bits of information and others, like I have done, may correct typos and things like that.  Another useful reason for the edit summaries is that it makes it easier to see what each person has contributed (also on the 'History' tab).  I've looked at your book a few times and everything seems to be fine.  Keep up the good work.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:47, 4 December 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Controversy over Violence Before Doom ==
The early 1990s saw an important turning point in the history of video games in the United States, especially in regards to how the industry treated violent games. 1992 and 1993 saw the release of a number of extremely controversial games, such as Lethal Enforcers, Night Trap, and Mortal Kombat.&lt;ref name=&quot;MortalKombatHistory&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LethalEnforcers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NightTrap&quot;/&gt;

At the time, there was no unified ratings system for games, and it could be difficult for parents to discern the kind of content that a game would contain. &lt;ref name=&quot;ESRBHistory&quot;/&gt; Even the same game could have vary wildly between different versions. Nintendo had policies in place that limited the level of violence and sex that could be shown in their games, while SEGA was much more permissive. As a result, the version of Mortal Kombat released for Nintendo's SNES console had significantly less on-screen blood than the version for the SEGA Genesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;SenateHearing&quot;/&gt;

On December 9th, 1993 the senate to held a hearing to discuss violent video games. At this hearing they hoped to gather the perspectives of relevant groups, including key figures from Nintendo of America and SEGA of America, as well as educators and other stakeholders. &lt;ref name=&quot;SenateHearing&quot;/&gt; Senators Joseph Lieberman, Byron Dorgan, and Herbert Kohl felt that with the holiday season approaching, the senate needed to act in order to curtail the level of violence and sex in games sold to children. &lt;ref name=&quot;SenateHearing&quot;/&gt; To demonstrate how inappropriate games were becoming, these senators showed video footage of two games, Night Trap and Mortal Kombat. &lt;ref name=&quot;SenateHearing&quot;/&gt;

Night Trap was a game that tasked the player with protecting a group of women from vampires.&lt;ref name=&quot;NightTrapContent&quot;/&gt; Even though there was no nudity, the game was still extremely voyeuristic and not necessarily appropriate for children.&lt;ref name=&quot;NightTrapContent&quot;/&gt; The senators recommended that Night Trap be removed from shelves, and SEGA ultimately complied in January 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;NightTrapPulled&quot;/&gt; While Night Trap was controversial for its sexual nature, Mortal Kombat was chosen as a game portraying extreme violence. In Mortal Kombat, the player fights to the death with another character, and upon winning a match is told to execute a &quot;fatality&quot; or finishing move, which were often extremely graphic. &lt;ref name=&quot;MortalKombatRetro&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Esrb_ratings.svg|thumb|ESRB Ratings. The current main ESRB ratings.]]While the senators did not want to impose policies that might be construed as censorship, they felt that if the game manufacturers did not make the creation of a voluntary ratings system a high priority, then congress would need to intervene.&lt;ref name=&quot;SenateHearing&quot;/&gt; From this mandate, the rating body known as the Entertainment Software Review Board (ESRB) was born.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESRBHistory&quot;/&gt; The ESRB, formally started in 1994, rates games based on their suitability for different aged audiences.

The system was entirely voluntary; however, most major retailers agreed not to stock games rated AO and to check IDs for games rated M.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESRBFAQ&quot;/&gt; Additionally, the console manufactures agreed not to license their console technology to games rated AO.&lt;ref name=&quot;ConsolesAO&quot;/&gt; As a result, AO games have extremely limited economic viability, and publishers have a strong incentive to avoid the rating. The ESRB is also able to use the AO rating to force publishers to change or re-release their titles, as occurred when Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was re-rated to AO following the discovery of a hack that could expose sexual content in the game. &lt;ref name=&quot;HotCoffee&quot;/&gt;

== Origins and History ==
The December 9th hearings on violence in video games focused primarily on games for home consoles, but on December 10th 1993, one day later, Texas game developer id Software released Doom for the PC, a game that introduced incredible technical innovation paired with a new level of violence.

After id Software released [[w:Wolfenstein 3D|Wolfenstein 3D]] in May of 1992, most of the company began work on a sequel, titled Spear of Destiny. This left John Carmack, a software engineer at id, to improve Wolfenstein 3D's engine. Tom Hall, creative director of Doom, wrote the game's design document, which he titled the ''Doom Bible''. Hall wanted Doom to tell a story, unlike Wolfenstein 3D; however, the other developers, specifically John Carmack disagreed. These disputes ultimately led to Hall being forced to resign in mid-1993. With Hall gone, most of the plans in the ''Doom Bible'' were left out of the game in favor of a more simplistic approach.

== Technological Innovation ==

[[File:Doom mapformat map.png|thumb|Doom map format. Height changes were now plausible as a result of improvements in the engine, resulting in much more realistic environments.]]
The Doom engine heavily extended Wolfenstein 3D's, which resulted in extremely realistic 3D graphics compared to other games of the time. The new engine supported height differences, texture-mapped floor and ceilings, and non-perpendicular walls, which allowed designers to create much more interesting level layouts. The game allowed for dynamic components, such as platforms that raise and lower themselves, which made the environment more believable and interactive. While the graphics may seem primitive today, the stereo sound, shadows, and variable lighting created an atmosphere that many players found terrifying. Doom was also able to import custom content files, which allowed players to create their own levels and share them with friends. For many years after Doom's launch, a vibrant community continued to create and play these custom levels.

== Release and Widespread Success ==
Doom was released as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareware shareware] on December 10, 1993, and was estimated to be installed on more than 10 million computers by 1995. Doom sold 1.1 million copies between 1993 and 1999, making it the 8th bestselling game of that time. During the same time period, its sequel, Doom 2, sold 1.5 million copies, placing 3rd.&lt;ref name=&quot;WarGames&quot; /&gt; id software stated jokingly in a press release that Doom was expected to be &quot;the number one cause of decreased productivity in businesses around the world&quot;. &lt;ref name=&quot;MastersOfDoom&quot; /&gt; The game had a large following among tech companies and universities, forcing Intel and Carnegie Mellon University to issue policies forbidding Doom during work.

An entire genre of games was made to emulate the style of Doom &lt;ref name=&quot;DoomCloneList&quot; /&gt;, at the time called &quot;Doom Clones&quot;. One of the most noteable Doom Clones was Duke Nukem 3D &lt;ref name=&quot;DukeNukemReview&quot; /&gt;, a shareware title released in January 1996 by 3D Realms. Duke Nukem 3D made over $7 million &lt;ref name=&quot;DukeNukemProfits&quot; /&gt; and had very similar gameplay to the original Doom. In late 1997, the term lost popularity in favor of the more general term &quot;First Person Shooter&quot;. This shift coincides with the release of Rare Ltd.'s GoldenEye 007, which borrowed many elements from Doom &lt;ref name=&quot;GoldenEyeReview&quot; /&gt;, but brought the genre from PC's to standard consoles. As Doom continued to be an influence in games, a developer of 1998's acclaimed First-Person Shooter, Half Life, stated that &quot;Most definitely: we wanted to scare you like Doom did.  Doom was a huge influence on most of us, and we really look on Doom as a brilliant achievement.  It fathered the first-person shooter industry.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;HalfLifeInterview&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Doom_clone_vs_first_person_shooter.png|thumb|Popularity of the phrases &quot;Doom Clone&quot; and &quot;First Person Shooter&quot; over time.]]

Upon its release, Doom was banned in Germany for &quot;bloody sadistic&quot; violence, and was relegated in adult-only stores &lt;ref name=&quot;DoomBan&quot; /&gt;. In July 2011, the game was unbanned, stating that the game now only had artistic and scientific interest and would not be appealing to children.

== Columbine ==

On April 20th 1999, students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold of Columbine High School in Columbine, Colorado effected the then most violent school shooting in the United States.  Harris and Klebold wounded twenty-one fellow students and killed twelve students, a teacher, and themselves.  Groups from concerned parents to psychologists criticized everything from Harris and Klebold’s favorite bands to the prescription antidepressants Harris took.  Among the hobbies criticized were violent computer games such as Doom and Wolfenstein 3D&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2009-04-13-columbine-myths_N.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Eric Harris’ passion for Doom was significant partly because numerous levels he created still exist.  Though Harris created many different levels – including one that resembled the equally violent Mortal Kombat, all of his levels feature excessive gore.  In a level named “Deathmatching in Bricks,” which Harris designed for player vs. player games, the player can see multiple different impaled or disemboweled space marines, some of which twitch perpetually on the pikes&lt;ref&gt;http://acolumbinesite.com/eric/doom.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  Rumors, which were later shown to be false, claimed that Doom levels mapped out Columbine High School and contained featured students as enemies&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snopes.com/horrors/madmen/doom.asp&lt;/ref&gt;.

Though Harris’ custom Doom levels were excessively gory, many otherwise normal players created intentionally violent Doom levels for the fun of it; Harris’ having created disturbing levels did not implicate the game per se.  In footage Harris and Klebold made in the basement of Harris’ house, Harris states that the shooting will “be like [expletive] Doom” and shortly thereafter describes his sawed-off shotgun as being “straight out of Doom.”  Furthermore, Harris named his 12-gauge pump shotgun “Arlene” after Arlene Sanders of the Doom novels&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Transcripts_of_%22The_Basement_Tapes%22_of_Eric_Harris_and_Dylan_Klebold&lt;/ref&gt;.  Considering the custom levels, the apparent daydreaming, and the naming of the shotgun, Doom likely helped Harris and Klebold imagine killing their classmates.  At the least, their references to the game help in understanding why violent video games received some of the blame for the shooting.

== Aftermath and Modern Day ==

Two years after the shooting, parents of the victims sued makers of violent video games.  Filed on behalf of the slain teacher, Dave Sanders, companies named included Sony, AOL, maker of Doom ID Software, and Atari.  Twenty-five companies were named in total.  The lawsuit itself stated “absent the combination of extremely violent video games and these boys' incredibly deep involvement, use of and addiction to these games and the boys' basic personalities, these murders and this massacre would not have occurred” and sought $5 billion in damages.  The case, however, was thrown out by the federal judge&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1295920.stm&lt;/ref&gt;.

More recently, a California bill attempting to restrict the sale of violent video games to children under 18 was struck down at the Supreme Court.  In a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court stated that video games qualify for first amendment protection.  Though psychological studies suggest that the interactivity of video games separates them from television programs or graphic comic books, the legal system has established and confirmed precedent asserting that they are effectively the same&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/supreme-court-strikes-down-california-s-nobr-video-game-nobr-law-20110627&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the wake of the tragedy, psychological studies done on the effects of violent video games begin to specifically mention Doom and its involvement in the Columbine massacre.  Though studies on the effects of violence in video games on aggression and behavior were not necessarily in reaction to the Columbine massacre, those such as Craig Anderson’s “Video Games and Aggressive Thoughts” contain specific reference to Eric Harris and Doom&lt;ref&gt;http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2000-08135-012&lt;/ref&gt;.  The continued reference to Columbine through as recently as 2008 in Chris Ferguson’s “The School Shooting/Violent Video Game Link” &lt;ref&gt;http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=3e37981d-0e2c-49f8-8b8e-1d49fdfd1df8%40sessionmgr111&amp;vid=6&amp;hid=127&lt;/ref&gt;suggest that Doom and Columbine have come to be the symbolize the relationship between violent video games and troubled youth.

== Lessons from Doom ==
The disparity between the way Doom's violent content was treated in Germany, and how Night Trap's sexual content was treated in the United States demonstrates the significant role that cultural values play in determining how products will be received. Doom's failure to take into account differing cultural values denied them access to consumers in a country that now has a thriving PC games culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;GermanyPCGames&quot;/&gt; Likewise, the ESRB leveraged how strongly Americans value free speech to create a voluntary review board instead of a government body. 

The ESRB itself also contributed to Doom's success in the United States. While the game was not rated for the original PC release, its debuts on other platforms were, and the system's high success rate at keeping games out of children's hands may have kept the worst controversy at bay.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESRBFAQ&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ESRBDoom&quot;/&gt; By agreeing to self-regulate and making concessions to the opposition before congress intervened, the gaming industry may have allowed games like Doom to release without fear of censorship.  Furthermore, given that the courts protect violent video games and that the ESRB succeeds in informing consumers, the path to resolving objections over consumer products may lie in cooperation rather than legal confrontation.

==Introduction==
[[w:Cyberterrorism|Cyberterrorism]] and [[w:Cyberwarfare|cyberwarfare]] involve attacks against information stored on computers and networks with the intention of inflicting harm.  With ever-increasing advancements being made in technological fields, acts of cyberterrorism and cyberwarfare are only becoming more prevalent in our world today.

==History==


==='''The Zimmermann Telegram'''===
[[File:Zimmermann-telegramm-offen.jpg|thumb|Zimmermann Telegram]] 

In January of 1917 during [[w:World War I|World War I]], Britain intercepted and deciphered a telegram, now known as the [[w:Zimmermann Telegram|Zimmermann Telegram]], from German Foreign Minister [[w:Arthur Zimmermann|Arthur Zimmermann]] to the German Minister of Mexico.  The Zimmermann Telegram proposed a German-Mexican alliance against the United States, where Mexico would regain lost territory in Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico.  &lt;ref&gt;The Zimmerman Telegram: Bringing America Closer to War. http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/4938&lt;/ref&gt;  


Up until this point in World War I, the United States had remained fairly neutral.  However, the American citizens were outraged when the telegram was portrayed in the press, causing the United States to declare war on Germany on April 6.


What is now known as cyberwarfare can be traced all the way back to 1917, when Britain intercepted and decoded a message that not only changed the course of World War I, but also changed the course of history.
 


==='''The Creeper'''===

[[w:Creeper (program)|Creeper]], the first known computer virus, was written in 1971 by Rob Thomas in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  


Programmers in the 1970's were no different than programmers today in their desire to test their systems and check their code, and that was the intent of Creeper.  Once Creeper got into a computer, it produced a message onscreen: &quot;I'm the Creeper. Catch me if you can!“  Later, the anti-virus program, Reaper, was written to catch Creeper. &lt;ref&gt;Staedter, T. (2011, March 16). First computer virus, creeper, was no bug. http://news.discovery.com/tech/first-computer-virus-creeper-was-no-bug-110316.html&lt;/ref&gt;


At the time, Creeper wasn't known as a [[w:Computer virus|&quot;virus&quot;]], since computer viruses hadn't existed before that point. 


==Modern Cyberthreats==


===Stuxnet===
{{rquote|right|[O]ne of the great technical blockbusters in malware history.|''Vanity Fair'', April 2011}}

The [[w:Stuxnet|Stuxnet]] virus is a computer worm found in 2009 in critical infrastructure software systems around the world.  It is known as the most sophisticated computer malware to date.  Its target was Iranian Uranium enrichment facilities, and Stuxnet reportedly did damage to two major nuclear facilities in Iran &lt;ref&gt;Zetter, Kim.  (July 11, 2011).  How Digital Detectives Deciphered Stuxnet, the Most Menacing Malware in History.  Wired.  Retrieved From http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/07/how-digital-detectives-deciphered-stuxnet/all/1. &lt;/ref&gt;.  The United States and Israel are rumored to be responsible for the attack.  There is no direct evidence, but diplomatic cables posted on WikiLeaks and other government correspondence support these claims &lt;ref&gt; Jamison, Jane.  Israel, U.S. Behind Stuxnet Computer Virus Attack on Iran/Will Reactor “Melt-Down?”  Right Wing News.  Retrieved From http://rightwingnews.com/israel/israel-u-s-behind-stuxnet-computer-virus-attack-on-iran-will-reactor-melt-down/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stuxnet attacked what are called Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition ([[w:SCADA|SCADA]]) systems.  SCADA systems are specialized software to control industrial infrastructure, including nuclear power plants, power grids, train switches, and gas pipelines.  These systems are often outdated and not written with security in mind.  Further, there is no economic incentive to replace them with more secure software.  Doing so would require large costs, heavy planning, and little to no added benefit once completed  &lt;ref&gt; Finkle, Jim.  UPDATE 3-U.S. probes cyber attack on water system.  Reuters.  Retrieved From http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/19/cybersecurity-attack-idUSN1E7AH1QU20111119.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Other Attacks===
[[File:Malware statics 2011-03-16-en.svg|thumb|right|300px|Malware by categories on March 16, 2011.]]

SCADA attacks are not the only type of cyberthreat today.  There are numerous examples of attacks from hacker groups and individuals, all with varying motives.  Some are to attack a particular company or corporation, some are to prove the weakness of systems, and some are even practical jokes.

Citibank had over 200,000 accounts compromised, with hackers stealing names, credit card numbers, and email addresses, simply by altering numbers in a URL  &lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Dean.  Citibank was hacked by altering URLs.  The Inquirer.  Retrieved From http://consumerist.com/2011/06/how-hackers-stole-200000-citi-accounts-by-exploiting-basic-browser-vulnerability.html.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Sony had over a million passwords stolen for its PlayStation Network accounts, exploiting a simple web vulnerability.  Further, the hacker group responsible for the attack, [[w:LulzSec|LulzSec]], claimed the passwords were stored unencrypted, or in cleartext form, considered an egregious misuse of handling of private information &lt;ref&gt;Ragan, Steve.  LulzSec:  Sony was asking for it – millions of records compromised (Update 2).  The Tech Herald.  Retrieved From http://www.thetechherald.com/articles/LulzSec-Sony-was-asking-for-it-millions-of-records-compromised-(Update-2).&lt;/ref&gt;.  The same group, LulzSec, also hacked [[w:Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]’s website and posted a fake story indicating the late rapper Tupac Shakur was still alive.  The group took offense to a PBS documentary about the leak of U.S. diplomatic cables posted on the WikiLeaks website &lt;ref&gt;Kanalley, Craig.  PBS Hacked, Claims ‘Tupac Alive’ in New Zealand.  The Huffington Post.  Retrieved From http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/30/pbs-hacked-tupac-alive_n_868673.html.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Potential Danger in the Future===

There are many cyberthreats, from ones against critical infrastructure to ones against government and corporate websites.  SCADA attacks on critical infrastructure have the most potential for disaster in the future.  For example, the United States has extensive missile defense capabilities.  But a hacker could hijack our nuclear launch system and launch our own missiles against us, or even take control of a power grid and cause blackouts, chaos, and confusion.  In 2007, researchers at the [[w:Idaho National Laboratory|Idaho National Laboratory]] identified a vulnerability in the power grid.  A [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJyWngDco3g video] of the danger was leaked to CNN, and shows a large diesel generator blowing up in smoke, all from a cyberattack &lt;ref&gt; Finkle, Jim.  UPDATE 3-U.S. probes cyber attack on water system.  Reuters.  Retrieved From http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/19/cybersecurity-attack-idUSN1E7AH1QU20111119.&lt;/ref&gt;.

As seen above, many companies and software systems today do not take cybersecurity as a serious matter.  Many considered the storing of cleartext passwords by [[w:Sony|Sony]] to be a violation of security principles and customer’s trust of their handling of private information.  Many SCADA systems do not take security or hacking into account even at all.  [[w:Siemens|Siemens]]’ Simatic WinCC SCADA system used a default password “hard-coded” into the software, meaning it was not mutable by the software users.  To add, it was posted online in product forums since 2008.  The Stuxnet virus exploited a default password weakness to weaken Iran’s nuclear enrichment capabilities &lt;ref&gt;Zetter, Kim.  SCADA System’s Hard-Coded Password Circulated Online for Years.  Wired.  Retrieved From http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/07/siemens-scada/.&lt;/ref&gt;.


===Facebook===
There are over 800 million active users on Facebook, 75% of whom are located outside the United States and 50% of whom log on to Facebook on any given day. &lt;ref&gt;Facebook Statistics.  Retrieved December 4, 2011, from Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics&lt;/ref&gt; Since Facebook is free to join for anyone with an email account, it is a quick and accessible tool for cyber-terrorists. It has become common for governments and terrorist organizations to monitor Facebook for updates that contain valuable information. By piecing together information from multiple service-members' Facebook accounts, foreign entities are sometimes able to determine schedules, locations, and intended actions of military units. In August 2009, the Marine Corps placed a ban on the use of the unclassified portion of the Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN) for social networking purposes. In March 2010, the United States Marine Corps released a [http://www.marines.mil/news/messages/Pages/MARADMIN181-10.aspx memo] which canceled the ban. According to the memo, Marines are allowed &quot;limited personal use&quot; of the MCEN but they must &quot;strictly adhere to sound operational security measures.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Responsible and Effective Use of Internet-Based Capabilities. Retrieved December 4, 2011, from Marines.mil: http://www.marines.mil/news/messages/Pages/MARADMIN181-10.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;


Facebook provides an electronic interface for much of the world to connect and communicate ideas. This creates an environment where information is virtually endless. File uploads and downloads on Facebook happen nearly constantly. Facebook users upload 250 million photos and install more than 20 million apps every day. The average user has 130 friends. &lt;ref&gt;Facebook Statistics.  Retrieved December 4, 2011, from Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Facebook issues] related to the social and psychological effects of Facebook, the endless exchange of information provides numerous opportunities for cyber-attacks and espionage.

===WikiLeaks===
[[Lentis/Freedom_of_Information:_WikiLeaks|WikiLeaks]] is an organization that collects and disperses sensitive or controversial information from anonymous sources around the world. WikiLeaks has released documents revealing corporate, federal, and international secrets in the name of free speech. Spokesperson [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_assange Julian Assange] claims that &quot;free speech is what regulates government and what regulates law.&quot; Assange further claims that law and government are derived from the flow of information and that this process is protected under national and international legislation. 


WikiLeaks has become a very controversial organization in the last two years. Some social groups believe that WikiLeaks is simply exercising freedom of the press, while others believe they are disrupting national security. On his [http://www.ted.com/speakers/julian_assange.html profile] from TED.com, Julian Assange is called &quot;...one of the world's most visible human-rights activists.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;TED Conferences LLC. (2010, July). Julian Assange: Whistleblower. Retrieved December 4, 2011, from TED Ideas Worth Spreading: http://www.ted.com/speakers/julian_assange.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Julian Assange has stated several times that WikiLeaks will do everything in its power politically, legally, and technologically to protect its sources and that it will attempt to maximize the political impact of its leaked material. This claim has been challenged by many in popular media.


In one of its most controversial leaks, WikiLeaks posted video of a 2007 Apache Helicopter airstrike. The clip, entitled &quot;Collateral Murder,&quot; was decrypted from US Army footage and showed a group of non-combatants, including two Reuters photographers, being fired upon by the Apache's 30-mm cannon. According to Assange, between 18 and 26 people were killed in the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Assange, J. (2010, July). Why the World Needs WikiLeaks. (C. Anderson, Interviewer). Retrieved from http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/julian_assange_why_the_world_needs_wikileaks.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In an April 2010 interview with Stephen Colbert, Julian Assange was criticized for having edited the video, omitting certain details (including the fact that some of the men killed had been armed), and entitling the video &quot;Collateral Murder.&quot; Colbert claimed that these discrepancies should redefine the leak as an editorial, since they &quot;...emotional[ly] manipulate&quot; the public's opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Assange, J. (2010, April 12). (S. Colbert, Interviewer). Retrieved from http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/270712/april-12-2010/julian-assange.&lt;/ref&gt; Julian Assange countered by claiming that the order to engage was given before the US soldiers properly identified the group.


WikiLeaks has become a well-known entity around the world. The US government has banned its employees from viewing classified documents publicized through WikiLeaks, and it claims WikiLeaks has damaged national security.&lt;ref&gt;TPM Media LLC. (2010, December). TPM Document Collection. Retrieved December 4, 2011, from TPM: http://talkingpointsmemo.com/documents/2010/12/ombs-email-to-government-agencies-about-wikileaks-access.php?page=1&lt;/ref&gt; Still, many groups celebrate and support WikiLeaks. In addition to TED.com, groups such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_(group)#Arrests_following_Operation_Avenge_Assange Anonymous] have defended Julian Assange and WikiLeaks.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;BBC News - Police arrest 'hackers' in US, UK, Netherlands&quot;. Bbc.co.uk. 2011-07-19. Retrieved 2011-08-30.&lt;/ref&gt; 

WikiLeaks has become a major player in the world of cyber-terrorism. It has gained widespread support and equally widespread disdain from people in all social groups. Many view it as a menace, but many find it to be an essential tool for checking the power of corporate and government entities.

==Relevant Social Groups==
Several relevant social groups need to be addressed regarding cyberterrorism and cyberwarfare.
 
==='''Governments'''===
Governments store top secret information in what is thought to be high security places.  However, internet attacks are made almost daily.  If the wrong person hacks the right information, governments could be in huge trouble.  Safety and security is at stake here. 

==='''Militaries'''===
It’s becoming easier and easier for the enemy to find out where military troops are stationed.  For example, a simple post on facebook from a soldier to his wife saying “We’ll be in Afghanistan tomorrow, then coming home” can give away huge amounts of information when pieced with other things that the enemy already knows.  This puts our military in very dangerous situations.

==='''Private Corporations'''===
Private Corporations are extremely vulnerable to cyber attacks.  For example, this past June, hackers acquired the personal information of about 360,000 of [[w:Citigroup|Citi's]] credit card holders.  Citi notified customers of the breach and began issuing new credit cards to the affected customers.  Citi said it has implemented “enhanced procedures” to prevent a recurrence of the breach, but didn’t elaborate.&lt;ref&gt;Rudy, M. (2011, June 21). Citi: Over 360,000 credit card accounts hacked, more than initially reported. http://www.cardratings.com/citi-over-360000-credit-card-accounts-hacked-more-than-initially-reported.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==='''Ordinary Citizens'''===
Recently, lots of cyber attacks have been coming out of China.  However, these hackers are not associated with the Chinese government or military. They're basically young, male, patriotic Chinese citizens, demonstrating their power and intelligence.  Citizens can also be the victims of cyberwarfare, such as having an email account hacked.&lt;ref&gt;Jasper, W. (2011, April 15). china accelerates cyber attacks, espionage. http://thenewamerican.com/world-mainmenu-26/asia-mainmenu-33/7135--china-accelerates-cyber-attacks-espionage&lt;/ref&gt;

==='''Hackers'''===
Hackers range from genius computer programmers to people who are actually employed by the government to obtain and decode highly classified information.  Internet hackers are becoming more prevalent as advancements in technology are being made daily.


==Conclusion==
An appetite for instant gratification plus ever-expanding technology equals opportunity.  Opportunity for good, harm, and everything in between.  As advances in technology are being made daily, cyberterrorism and cyberwarfare are becoming increasingly more common in our world today.  What our future holds in these regards?  Only time will tell.

==Background==
Vancomycin is considered a last-resort antibiotic, and tends to be effective in treating bacteria that is highly resistant to many, if not all, other drugs. It is a glycopeptide, derived from ''Amycolatopsis orientalis'' cultures. One of the most well-known bacteria that vancomycin is effective against is methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (MRSA). Overall, vancomycin is successful against various Gram-positive bacteria, including highly resistant streptococci, enterococci, and staphylococci strains. Vancomycin should not be taken as an oral medication, as it cannot be absorbed that way, but rather through an intravenous injection. &lt;ref name=&quot;Dewick&quot;&gt; Dewick, Paul M. ''Medicinal Natural Products: A Biosynthetic Approach, Third Edition'', John Wiley and Sons Ltd. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;



==Overview==
Vancomycin works by binding with the terminal amino acids of peptidoglycan chains in cell walls. By doing so, the production of the bacterial cell wall is prevented by not allowing the cross-linking between neighboring peptidoglycan strands. Without a strong wall, cell lysis is induced and the bacterial cell falls apart. &lt;ref name=&quot;Dewick&quot;/&gt;


== Mechanism of Vancomycin ==
In bacterial cells the cell wall consists of peptidoglycan. This peptidoglycan is made up of repeating units  of two sugar molecules, N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM). Attached to NAM is a series of amino acids that end with a D-alanine dipeptide. Inside the cytoplasm at the cell membrane, NAM and NAG are linked at the bactoprenol to form the disaccharide NAM-NAG. NAM-NAG is brought to the outside area of the cell membrane by the bactoprenol, where penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) bind to the D-Ala dipeptide. One PBP is transpeptidase, which links the peptide side chains of two NAG molecules to form a peptide cross link. This peptide cross link helps to add stability to the cell wall by connecting a L-lysine of one NAM side chain to the D-Ala of another NAM side chain. &lt;ref name=&quot;Slonczewski&quot;/&gt;

Vancomycin binds to the D-Ala-D-Ala end of the NAM-NAG disaccharide and prevents transpeptidase from making the peptide cross link. &lt;ref name=&quot;Slonczewski&quot;&gt; Slonczewski, Joan L. Foster, John W. ''Microbiology: An Evolving Science, Second Edition'', W.W. Norton &amp; Company. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
As autolysins continue breaking the peptide cross link and no new cross link can be formed because of Vancomycin, the bacterium bursts as a result of osmotic lysis.

== Medicinal Uses ==
Vancomycin hydrochloride is primarily used in the treatment of severe infections resulting from susceptible strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Typically, vancomycin is a last resort type of antibiotic that is normally used for patients allergic to penicillin, for those that haven't responded to other types of antibiotics (like cephalosporins), and for patients plagued by vancomycin-susceptible bacteria. Courses of treatment should be determined once the type of bacteria is identified and susceptibility data has been obtained. It has been effective against staphylococcal endocarditis, other infections from staphylococci (bone infections, respiratory infections, and skin infections). Other types of infections that vancomycin has been effective against include diphtheroid endocarditis. To improve the effectiveness of combating bacterial infections, vancomycin will often be used with aminoglycosides or rifampin. Vancomycin is not effective against viral infections.

Like all medications, there are typically risks and side effects associated with each drug. As with most antibiotics, the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria has become an ever increasing battle. When drug-resistant bacteria form, it becomes more difficult to treat and combat the infections related from these bacteria. Vancomycin must be administered intravenously because the drug is very irritating to the tissue. If the medication interacts with the muscle tissue, typically there is associated muscle pain, tenderness, and the tissue begins to die, therefore supporting the need to administer vancomycin intravenously. Also, prolonged use of vancomycin with other medications can have adverse effects as well. For example, prolonged use with anesthetics can lead to complications such as hypotension, pruritis, and erythema. Some of the side effects with antibiotics typically include diarrhea and stomach pains. Other effects include anaphylaxis, drug fever, nausea, chills, and rashes.

==Side Effects==
Vancomycin can trigger violent allergic reactions on certain individuals. The most common severe symptoms are:
* hives
* swelling on the lips, face, throat or tongue
* hearing loss
* fever
* lightheadedness
* extreme stomach pain
* fainting 

==Incompatibility with other drugs==
When mixed with certain other drugs, vancomycin can cause severe reactions. The most common drugs that react with vancomycin are:
* amikacin
* gentamicin
* kanamycin
* neomycin
* streptomycin
* tobramycin

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Mechanism of Action ==
Decongestants stimulate the alpha-adrenergic receptors to constrict dilated arteries within the nasal mucosa. This  decreases the amount of swelling and formation of mucus in the nose from the common cold, sinusitis, and upper respiratory allergies.

== Examples ==
Afrin is the brand name of oxymetazoline. It is administered nasally and is available in the form of nasal drops, spray or mist.

Neo-Synephrine, Neo-Synephrine II is the brand name for phenylephrine. It is administered nasally in the form of nasal drops and spray or intravenously.

Sudafed is the brand name for pseudoephedrine. It is administered orally in a capsule, tablet, or oral solution.

Zyrtec-D is the brand name for cetirizine-pseudoephedrine. It is administered orally in the form of a tablet.

Allegra-D is the brand name for fexofenadine-pseudoephedrine. It is administered orally in the form of a tablet.

Claritin-D is the brand name for loratadine-pseudoephedrine. It is administered orally in the form of a tablet.

== Side Effects ==
Decongestants may cause stimulation in the central nervous system, increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, insomnia, anxiety, tremor, rhinitis medicamentosa, and headache. Therefore, decongestants should be avoided if patient has diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, prostatic hypertrophy, or Tourette's syndrome. Decongestants are usually combined with antihistamines to decrease the effect of decongestants alone on patients with hypertension. However, combination decongestants cannot completely cancel out those effects.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Diels-Alder Reaction:
      The Diels-Alder reaction is a cycloaddition reaction between a diene and a dienophile to produce a six-membered-ring.The formation of new carbon-carbon bonds is one of the most important aspects of tsynthetic organic chemistry. Many reactions, such as the Grignard reaction and the use of acetylide ions is Sn2 reactions, have been developed with this one goal in mind. One problem associated with most of these C-C bond forming reactions is the necessity for exotic conditions. For example, the Grignard reaction requires completely water free conditions and acetylide ions must be generated in liquid ammonia solution.
      When a synthetic sequence calls for the formation of a ting of carbon atoms, this problem is compounded. Fortunately, the formation of six membered carbon rings is much simpler than it would first appear. The Diel-Alder reaction was discovered in 1928. This reaction forms a six membered ring from two pieces that are a conjugated diene, which provides four of the ring atoms, and a dieneophile, which provides two of the ring atoms. The main requirements for these species are that the conjugated diene have to besomewhat electron rich which is normally the case for dienes. It also requires that the diene have to be able to achieve the cis conformation, and that the dieneophile have a two atom pi system that is relatively electron poor.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==How RNA Unfolds and Refolds==
	
In general, RNA unfolds from the tertiary structure to secondary structure to single stranded RNA and vice-versa is true for how RNA folds. RNA unfolding depends on temperature to denature RNA or sometimes enzymes such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRps) or helicases. Moreover, scientists use the techniques called optical tweezers, which is also called laser tweezers, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer, also known as FRET, to study how secondary and tertiary RNA structures unfold and refold. Furthermore, scientists use cation binding to study how ribozymes fold and unfold. 

==Secondary Structure RNA==

&lt;u&gt;''Unfolding'': &lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Secondary RNA structure can unfold by increasing the temperature or using chemical reagents to denature RNA. Another technique used to study how RNA unfolds is optical tweezers. This technique applies a force that causes RNA to unfold in physiological temperature and buffer solutions (79). For example, the ends of a hairpin RNA have two beads—one that has an optical trap and the other has a micropipette strap. From this, RNA can be pulled and unzipped as the micropipette moves. 

&lt;u&gt;''Refolding'':&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
RNA refolding occurs in the reverse process of RNA unfolding. When micropipette moves, RNA can be pushed back which makes RNA relaxed and refolds RNA. However, if the relaxation force applied by optical tweezers increases, this can cause RNA to misfold (81). 

Misfolding in RNA can be corrected by increasing the force.  When force is increased, the RNA will try to refold into an active and functional form.

==Tertiary Structure RNA== 

&lt;u&gt;''Unfolding''&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Tertiary RNA structure is relatively weak therefore, by changing the temperature or solutions that are not much different from the physiological state can destabilize RNA interaction. 

&lt;u&gt;''Refolding''&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A technique called FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, can be used to understand how RNA folds (78). Scientists label two-dyed nucleotides on RNA strand and through observations of RNA folding, FRET signal allows scientists to measure the distance and motif between those two-dyed labeled nucleotides with respect to time. Furthermore, scientists can also use FRET to understand the changes in RNA conformation when RNA is bound to Mg2+ or ribosomal proteins.

==Single-molecule of RNA Enzymes==
	
To study the single-molecule of RNA enzymes, scientists use ribozymes and FRET technique. The difference between the study of how ribozyme unfolds and folds and that of the secondary or tertiary RNA structure is that scientists add a series of Mg2+ and they observe the FRET signals in order to tell whether ribozyme is docked (folded) or undocked (unfolded). From this Mg2+ “pulse-chase experiments,” scientists can find the “kinetic fingerprints” of the hairpin ribozymes’ enzymatic states (84). Based on this, scientists were able to figure out that ribozymes participate in chemical reactions such as oxidation or reduction, synthesis of nucleotides, and formation of peptides. Thus, the study of ribozymes reinforces the RNA World hypothesis, which stated that RNA preceded DNA (85). 

==Effects of Ligand and Protein Binding to RNA==

Another way that RNA unfolds is through the appearance or the lack of ligands and/or proteins. Specific proteins and/or ligands bind to RNA and cause it to unzip. By using a technique called single-molecule fluorescence, scientists studied ribonucleoproteins (RNP) and its effect on RNA (88). In this technique, scientists can count RNP subunits in bacteriophage through “electron cryomicroscopy and crystallography” (89). Then, when RNA hairpins unfold, RNPs are assembled and proteins bind to RNA causing RNA to change conformation.

There are three commonly used applications of single-molecule fluorescence techniques. The first is simply counting the subunits in an ribonucleoprotein (RNP). The second common technique is annealing two hairpins, requiring the unfolding of both. As of current, the specific protein role is still not entirely clear. The third technique is to use the fact the RNP assembly is sequential. Because RNP assembly is sequential, this is an indication that events that occur early on in protein binding result in conformational changes in the RNA. By labeling a pair of fluorophores at different positions of telomeric RNA scientists have identified the binding of p65 protein can induce conformational change.&lt;ref&gt;Li PTX, Vieregg J, Tinoco I Jr. How RNA Unfolds and Refolds. Annu Rev Biochem. 2008;77:77-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

In DNA, argininine is the component used to bind and stabilize the molecule. However, in RNA, it is argininamide, and not arginine that stabilizes and binds the TAR hairpin.&lt;ref&gt;Li PTX, Vieregg J, Tinoco I Jr. How RNA Unfolds and Refolds. Annu Rev Biochem. 2008;77:77-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enzymes used to unfold RNA==

Scientists learned that RNA needs energy input in order to unfold itself however, RNA folding does not require energy because this is a spontaneous reaction. According to the authors in the “How RNA Unfolds and Refolds,” in order to unfold three to four base pairs in RNA, one ATP is used (89). Therefore, enzymes such as helicases or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase help RNA unfold by using chemical energy that is present when nucleoside triphosphates undergo a hydrolysis reaction. For example, helicases take the energy from the ATP hydrolysis reaction to extract the proteins bound on RNA and unfold the double-stranded RNA (90). Therefore, as the concentration of ATP goes up, the faster this step will be. Although RNA-dependent RNA polymerase has not completely explored, scientists believed and expected that it is similar to how helicases work. 

Another way that RNA can be unfolded is by binding single stranded RNA to a single-strand specific protein. However, in this situation, the binding must be strong so that it can overcome the forces seen in base pair bonding.&lt;ref&gt;Li PTX, Vieregg J, Tinoco I Jr. How RNA Unfolds and Refolds. Annu Rev Biochem. 2008;77:77-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

In viral RNA replication, RNA must be single-stranded in order for its sequence to be interpreted during replication and translation. The RNA molecule is first unfolded by an RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase or ribosome. Through the hydrolysis of nucleoside triposphates, the enzymes can use that energy to be able to unfold the RNA substrates. The RNA needs to have varying sequences.&lt;ref&gt;Li PTX, Vieregg J, Tinoco I Jr. How RNA Unfolds and Refolds. Annu Rev Biochem. 2008;77:77-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tertiary Structure Folding ==


The tertiary folding refers to the interactions between the distal domains that form the structure needed for the RNA to carry out catalytic and regulatory functions. These interactions are fairly weak and can be easily unfolded using small change in temperature and solutions. Specifically, the FRET technique is utilized to observe the tertiary folding of RNA. This technique is performed by measuring the distance between the two florescence-dyed nucleotides. This enables observation of specific tertiary motifs in real time which consists of distinctive folding of the interacting RNA strands. The FRET technique was crucial in studying the RNA folding by measuring the conformational change during the binding of salt (Mg2+) or ribosomal protein. One prominent motif that was studied extensively is the tetraloop-receptor interaction which is present in many large folded RNAs and has been used to create synthetic RNA “building blocks.” 

Using optical tweezers and increasing the force, RNA can be unfolded into four distinct conformations in the following order: kissing complex, two linked hairpins, one hairpin, and single strand. Similarly, when the force is decreased, the single strand can be refolded in the reverse order into the kissing complex. The kissing interaction is defined as the base pairing (complementary sequences) between the two hairpin loops and the hairpin loops is created when two complementary sequences in a single RNA meet and bind.

[[File:Kissing-loop-interaction.jpg|Kissing-loop-interaction]]

==Salt Effect on Tertiary Structures==
In tertiary structures folding and stability are highly dependent on ionic conditions, especially of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus metal ions have a greater effect on tertiary structures than on secondary structures of RNA. Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; slows down the kinetics of breaking tertiary interactions, but only moderately affects the folding rates.

Common motifs that demonstrate salt effects include intron ribozymes, pseudoknots, and loop-loop interactions:
In &lt;b&gt;intron ribozymes&lt;/b&gt; distinct rips were observed in MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, indicating the unfolding of a structural domain. When there was no Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, no rips were observed.

In &lt;b&gt;pseudoknots&lt;/b&gt; compact structures are formed, and have increased stability with bound Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.

In &lt;b&gt;loop-loop interactions&lt;/b&gt; force manipulation is used to see how an intramolecular kissing complex changes. This can be seen from the unfolding and refolding of secondary structures. The base pair sequence affects the salt dependence of kissing interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Li PTX, Vieregg J, Tinoco I Jr. How RNA Unfolds and Refolds. Annu Rev Biochem. 2008;77:77-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Marijuana ==
1)	Inhibitory neurotransmitters are active in the synapse before marijuana goes into the system. The job of these neurotransmitters is inhibiting dopamine from being released into the synapse. 

[[File:Marijuana 1 2.jpg]]

2)	Cannabinoid receptors shut off the releasing of inhibitory neurotransmitters when activated by the body’s native cannabinoid. Dopamine is released when there is no inhibition.

[[File:Marijuana 2 1.jpg]]

3)THC, the active chemical in marijuana, mimics anandamide and binds to cannabinoid receptors. The inhibition is shut off and dopamine starts to exit into the synapse.

[[File:Marijuana 3 1.jpg]]

4)Anandamide is famous for being involved in removing  short term memories. It is also responsible for giving the relaxation and calmness feeling and it slows down the movement. Unlike THC, anandamide is very fragile and has a the tendency to break down very quickly in the body. That is why anadamide doesn’t produce perpetual natural “high”.

== Cocaine ==
1)	Dopamine is taken out of the synaptic cleft by the dopamine transporting molecules after dopamine is done with its job.

[[File:Cocaine 1 1.jpg]]

2)	What cocaine does is blocking the transporters, making dopamine stuck in the synaptic cleft. As a result, dopamine binds to the receptors over and over and that causes overstimulation in the cell.

[[File:Cocaine 2 1.jpg]]


3)	Finally, Cocaine concentrates in the reward pathway of the brain. It also activates the part of the brain that is in control of the voluntary movement. That is why people who abuse the use of cocaine and not able to stay still.

== Alcohol ==
1)	GABA which is an inhibitory transmitter is active all over the brain. These neurotransmitters control the neural activity in many of brain pathways. The cell is less likely to fire when GABA binds to its receptors. 

[[File:Alcohol 1 1.jpg]]

2)	In another area of the brain, Glutamate acts as the brain’s general purpose excitatory neurotransmitter.

[[File:Alcohol 2 1.jpg]]
3)	Alcohol delivers sedative punch once it goes into the brain. It interacts with GABA receptors and drives them to be more inhibitory. Then, it binds to the glutamate receptors and inhibits glutamate neurotransmitters from binding to their receptor. As a result, the cell is inhibited from being excited.

[[File:Alcohol 3 1.jpg]]
4)	Therefore, alcohol affects areas of the brain that are in charge of memory formation and decision making (frontal lobe).

== Heroin ==
1)	Inhibitory transmitters that are active in the synapse inhibit dopamine neurotransmitters from being released.

[[File:Heroin 1 1.jpg]]

2)	When natural opiates that are produced by the body (native opiates) activate opiate receptors, inhibitory transmitters release is shut down. When there is no inhibition, dopamine is released and it binds to dopamine receptors.
 
[[File:Heroin 2 1.jpg]]

3)	When heroin enters the system, it binds to the opiate receptors because it has the same shape as native opiates. This mechanism turns off dopamine inhibition and dopamine gets released into the synapse. This in turn generates feelings of sedation and well-being. 

[[File:Heroin 3 1.jpg]]

4)	These opiate receptors are connected to neurons that are in charge of the transmission of pain, stress response, and emotional attachment. As a result, drugs that are heroin-like are used as painkillers to sustain pain of a massive injury.


== LSD ==
1)	LSD drug is exclusive on a neuron called serotonin. LSD shape resembles that of Serotonin  and diminish the serotonin effect by binding to its receptor.

[[File:LSD 1.jpg]]


2)	There are many kinds of serotonin receptors in the brain and each is responsible for a specific function.

[[File:LSD 22.jpg]]

3)	LSD binds to certain receptors but not in the same way usually.  LSD can inhibit or excite these receptors. This is why LSD has complex sensory effects.

[[File:LSD 2.jpg]]

4)	LSD is just like other hallucinogens, they excite a certain region in the brain called locus coeruleus. In this area, there is a neuron attached to it that branches to different sensory areas in the brain. Locus coeruleus is in charge of feelings like wakefulness and illicitness response to unexpected stimuli.

== Meth ==
1)	Dopamine is removed from the synaptic cleft using dopamine transporters. Meth is taken into the cell because meth mimics the shape of dopamine and the dopamine transporters does not recognize the dopamine from meth.

[[File:Meth 1.jpg]]


2)	When meth is transported to the inside of the cell, it enters the vesicle that carries dopamine and forces the dopamine out of the vesicle.


[[File:Meth 2.jpg]]



3)	The dopamine gets pumped out of the cell into the synaptic cleft when dopamine is abundant  inside the cell by the reverse pumping of the dopamine transporters.


[[File:Meth 3.jpg]]


4)	Once the dopamine is outside of the cell, it binds to the dopamine receptors again and again because it is abundant in synaptic cleft.


[[File:Meth 4.jpg]]



5)	Meth works directly on the brain’s reward pathway. Therefore, it is highly addictive and meth users feel intense pleasure when they take it.

== Ecstasy ==

1)	Serotonin is removed from the synaptic cleft by serotonin transporters after they have done their job. 

[[File:Ecstasy 1.jpg]]


2)	Serotonin transporters pick up ecstasy because ecstasy mimics the shape of serotonin. Actually, serotonin transporters have a higher affinity to ecstasy than serotonin molecules themselves.


[[File:Ecstasy 2.jpg]]


3)	The interaction of serotonin transporters with ecstasy confuses the transporters in a way that they start pumping serotonin out of the cell into the synaptic cleft. 


[[File:Ecstasy 3.jpg]]


4)	Because serotonin becomes abundant in the synaptic cleft, it starts binding to receptors over and over causing overstimulation to the cell.


[[File:Ecstasy 4.jpg]]



5)	Ecstasy has an effect on sleep, mood, perception, and appetite.  It also has an indirect effect on reward pathway. Ecstasy is not as addictive as other drugs because it has a milder release of dopamine along the reward pathway.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Bacterial Proteins==
Bacterial proteins are the most powerful human poisons known and belong to two broad categories: lipopolysaccharides (Gram-negative bacteria) and proteins, which are released from bacterial cells. Endotoxins, which are structural components of bacteria, are cell-associated substances that a located in the cell envelope and can be released from growing bacteria or lysed cells as a consequence of effective host defense mechanisms or antibiotics. The extracellular diffusible toxins are referred to as exotoxins and are usually secreted by bacteria during exponential growth. Exotoxins are usually polypeptides that act at tissue sites remote from the original point of bacterial invasion or growth. The location for activity of a particular toxin, like Botulinium, is determined by the site of damage. Enterotoxin, neurotoxin, leukocidin and hemolsyin are terms that describe the target site of well-defined protein toxins. Although the tissues affected and the target site may be known, the exact mechanism by which toxins cause death is not clear and is subject to debate.

==Botulinium neurotoxins==
[[File:Botulinumtoxin surface 3BTA.png|thumb|275px|Botulinum Neurotoxin type A, Botox]]
Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs), a family of bacterial proteins produced by the anaerobic bacteria Clotridium botulinu, and the causative agent of botulism, is acknowledged to be the most poisonous protein known. Botulism poisoning is a serious and life-threatening illness in humans and animals. BoNT proteases disable synpathic vesicle exocytosis by cleaving their cytosolic SNARE substrates. There are seven distinct BoNT isoforms (A-G), which show strong amino acid sequence similarity. Human botulism is caused by the BoNT serotypes A, B, E and F. Interestingly, type A is used for various cosmetic and medical procedures, more commonly known as Botox.

BoNTs exert their neurotoxic effect by a multistep mechanism: binding, internalization, membrane translocation, intracellular traffic and proteolytic degradation. The activated mature toxin consists of 3 parts: the N-terminal light chain (~50 kDa),  the heavy chain (100 kDa) that encompases the light chain (HN) and the receptor-binding doman (HC). HC determines the cellular specificity with a protein receptor (SV2 or Syt depending on the isoform) and a ganglioside. HN is a helical bundle that chaperones the light chains across endosomes where it is driven by a transmembrane proton gradient. Then, BoNTs enter the cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis, induces a conformational change and the light chains (LCs) cleave the unique components of the synaptic vesicle docking-fusion complex known as SNARE. As a result, cleavage of SNARE nullifies vesicle fusion and synaptic transmission, which causes the severe paralysis characteristic of botulism.

==Tetanus toxin==
Tetanus toxin is a very powerful neurotoxin produced by the vegetative cell of ''Clostridium tetani'' in conditions that lack oxygen (anaerobic). As the bacterium matures, it developed its characteristic terminal spores which also give them advantage by increasing the bacteria's resistance to heat and most antiseptics. The toxin cause tetanus, a fatal disease that involves unfavorable muscle spasms that can cause respiratory failure and even death. The LD50 of this toxin has been measured to be approximately 1 ng/kg, making it the second most deadliest toxin in the world after the Botulinium neurotoxins. 

The mechanism of the toxin is it first travels through the vascular and lymphatic systems of the body, disrupting the neuromuscular junctions and the central nervous system. Tetanus toxin blocks the release of inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine by degrading the protein synaptobrevin. This causes the failure of regulating motor reflexes by sensory stimulation, which leads to the muscle depolarizing even with the smallest of action potentials. This continued depolarization causes the antagonist and agonist muscles to contract simultaneously and this generalized contraction causes the symptom known as tetanic spasm.

==Diphtheria Toxin==
[[File:Corynebacterium diphtheriae Gram stain.jpg|thumb|275px|Corynebacterium diphtheriae gram strain]]
Diphtheria Toxin is a bacterial exotoxin caused by Corynebacterium Diphtheriae. This toxin exists as a single polypeptide chain, about 60,000 daltons in molecular weight. Outside of the cell, the toxin is produced in its inactive form, later to be activated by trypsin, a proteolytic enzyme, in the presence of thiol. Thiol acts as a reducing agent during this activation process. The toxin consists of two parts: Fragment A and Fragment B. Fragment A, which is responsible for the catalytic activity of the toxin, is masked until it reaches the target cell. The hydrophobic portion of the toxin, named Fragment B, is responsible for interacting with cell membrane receptors on the target cell surface. 

Diphtheria toxin may enter a target cell via direct entry or receptor mediated endocytosis. In direct entry, the toxin binds to a target cell surface receptor. This binding induces the formation of a pore on the cell membrane, allowing the catalytic chain of the toxin to enter the target cell’s cytoplasm. During receptor-mediated endocytosis, the toxin is placed in a vesicle, where the pH drops, allowing both Fragment A and Fragment B to unfold. The hydrophobic regions of both chains then enter the vesicle membrane. Next, reduction and proteolytic cleavage of the A chain is released into the cytoplasm, where it regains enzymatic conformation.

Diphtheria toxin utilizes NAD as a substrate, and catalyzes ADP ribosylation, where the ADP-ribose portion of NAD combines with elongation factor-2 (EF-2). This process inactivates protein synthesis (in animal cells), resulting in cell death.

===Corynebacterium Diphtheriae===
Corynebacerium Diphtheriae consists of two subunits. Subunit A contains an NH3+ group and is responsible for the enzymatic activity during the inhibition of EF-2. This inhibition interferes with the protein synthesis, resulting in cell death. Subunit B contains a carboxylic acid and a Hinge loop, which permits movement of the regulatory domain. Subunit B allows the toxin to bind to the membrane of a target host cell. This subunit possesses a region, known as T (translocation) domain, which is inserted into the target cell’s membrane, thus ensuring the release of Fragment A (catalytic component of the toxin) into the cytoplasm of the host cell.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A model organism is an indispensable tool used for medical research. Scientists use organisms to investigate questions about living systems that cannot be studied in any other way. These models allow scientists to compare creatures that are different in structures, but share similarities in body chemistry. Even organisms that do not have a structural body, such as yeast and mold, can be useful in providing incites to how tissues and organs work in the human body. This is because enzymes used in metabolism and the processing of nutrients are similar in all living things. Other reasons model organisms are useful are that they are simple, inexpensive, and easy to work with.

Examples of model organisms:

==Escherichia Coli:'' Bacterium==

There are good and bad bacteria. The one form of bacterium one is usually familiar with is the ''E. coli'' that is associated with tainted hamburger meat. However, there also exist &quot;non-disease-causing&quot; strains of ''E. coli''. in the intestinal tracts of humans and animals. These bacteria are the main source in providing vitamins K and B-complex. They also help in the digestive system and provide protection against harmful bacteria. Differentiating between harmful and helpful strains of ''E. coli'' can help distinguish the genetic differences between bacteria in humans and bacteria that cause poisoning.

==Dictyostelium Discoideum (Dicty): Amoeba==

''Amoeba'' is microscopic in that 100,000 of them equal a grain of sand. This organism has between 8,000 and 10,000 genes and many of them are similar to those in humans and other animals. ''Dicty'' cells usually grow independently. However, with limited food resources, these cells can pile on top on each other to form a multicelled structure of up to 100,000 cells. When migrating, this slug-like organism will leave behind a trail of slime. They can disperse spores that are capable of generating new amoeba.

==Neurospora Crassa: Bread Mold==

This type of model organism is used world wide in genetic research. Researchers like to use bread mold because it is easy to grow and can answer questions about how species adapt to different environments. ''Neurospora'' is also useful in the studying of sleep cycles and rhythms of life.

==Saccharomyces Cerevisiae: Yeast==

Yeast is commonly used in research, but it is also an important part of life outside the laboratory. It is a fungus and has eukaryote properties. Researchers prefer yeast because it is fast to grow, cheap and safe to use, and easy to work with. Yeast can be used as a host for mammalian genes, and it allows scientists to study how they function inside the host. Discoveries of the antibiotic penicillin or the protein called sirtuin that interferes with aging resulted from observing fungus. 

==Arabidopsis Thaliana: Mustard Plant==

''Arabidopsis'' is a flowering plant that is related to cabbage and mustard. Researchers often use this plant to study plant growth because it has very similar genes with other flowering plants and little encoded-protein DNA, which makes it easy to study genes. ''Arabidopsis'' has eukaryotic cells, and the plant can mature quickly in six weeks. Cell communication in plants operates much like human cells do, and this makes it easier to study genetics.

==Caenorhabditis Elegans:'' Roundworm==

Roundworms are as tiny as the head of a pin, and they live in dirt. In the laboratory, they live in petri dishes and feed on bacteria. This ''C. elegans'' creature has 959 cells and one third of the cells form the nervous system. Researchers like to use roundworm because it is transparent, which allows a clear view of what goes on in the body. ''C. elegans'' has more than 19,000 genes compare to a human of about 25,000 genes. ''C. elegans'' is the first animal genome to be decoded, and the major of the genes is similar to that of humans and other organisms.

==Drosophila Melanogaster: Fruit Fly==

This type of fruit fly is most commonly used in research. Fruit flies in the laboratory are often exposed to harmful chemicals and radiation that can change their DNA sequences. Researchers allow flies to mate and then study their offspring for mutations. The mutant flies help researchers to study detective genes. Fruit flies can reproduce quickly, which makes it easy to create mutant flies, and this enables researchers to study how genes function. By relating some of the defects found in fruit flies with those in humans, researchers may discover the defective genes as well.

==Danio Rerio: Zebrafish==

Zebrafish habitat in slow streams, rice paddies, and the Ganges River in East India and Burma. They are also found in pet stores. Researches prefer zebrafish because their eggs and embryos are transparent, which provide a plain view of the development process. It takes only 2 to 4 days for zebrafish cells to divide and form the fish's body parts: eyes, heart, liver, and etc. This research enables scientists to study birth defects, the proper development of the heart and blood.

==Mus Musculus: Mouse==

Mice are mammals like humans, and we share 85 percent of our genes. Because mice are very similar to people, they are used to study diseases in humans. Scientists can create &quot;knockout&quot; mice, missing gene mice, and study how the mice function.

==Rattus Norvegicus: Rat==

Rat was the first animal to be used in scientific research. For the most part, laboratory rats are used to test drugs and most of what we know about cancer started with rat research. Rats are mammals and are bigger than most model organisms, which makes it easy for scientists to perform experiments on the rat brain. Scientists have learned about substance abuse and addiction, learning and memory, and neurological diseases through rats. They are also useful in the studying of asthma, lung injury, and arthritis disease.

==Pan Troglodytes:'' Chimpanzee==

The fact that chimpanzees share 99 percent of the genes with humans makes them very unique for studying human genome. Because they are immune to malaria or AIDS, ongoing medical research is trying to discover the reason at genomic level. 

==Lambda Phage: Virus==
A lambda phage is a bacterial virus, or bacteriophage that infects a bacterial species such as escherichia coli. This virus has a temperate lifestyle meaning that it may well reside within the genome of its host until its lyses out of its host, also known as lysogeny. The lambda phage consists of constituent parts that all take part in its integration in the host genome. The phage contains a capsid head, a tail, and tail fibers for which is used to latch on to its host. The importance of this model organism to scientists is its ability to incorporate itself into its hosts genome allowing to integrate its genomic DNA into its host. This is especially helpful to scientists for genomic work.
 
==Chlamydomonas reinhardtii: Green Algae==
This model organism is a unicellular green algae that is primarily used to study the mechanisms of photosynthesis, regulation of metabolism, cell to cell recognition, adhesion, response to nutrient deprivation and flagella motility. It proves to have a great significance to scientists because it can grow in media lacking organic carbon and chemical energy sources. In addition this model organisms is associated with fluorescence and can grow in the dark when supplied with other unicellular green algae as a source of hydrogen.

[[Image:Mark_mcgwire.jpg‎ |right|thumb|200px|Mark McGwire confesses to using steroids on and off for a decade]]
The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994%E2%80%9395_Major_League_Baseball_strike player's strike of 1994] caused attendance for MLB games was at an all time low and threatened to bankrupt the sport. That was until 1998, when two players began a well-publicized race to beat one of baseball’s most coveted records - most homeruns in a single season &lt;ref name=&quot;baseball&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_baseball_in_the_United_States History of Baseball in the United States].&lt;/ref&gt;. Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa’s battle for the new record revitalized baseball. However, the sudden offensive explosion raised questions about how these numbers were being achieved. Rumors of steroid use among players were later released. Newspaper columns and sports talk radio shows were filled with comments about who’s on what and what should be done. In this chapter, we focus on steroid use in professional baseball and how changes in the professional sport impact society.

=='''History'''==
==='''Performance Enhancing Drugs'''===
    
Performance enhancing drug use dates back to the ancient Greeks, and we can see how they have developed through the years.  Although they did not use the same type of steroids we use today, they were also focused on increasing athletes stamina and performance in sporting events &lt;ref name=&quot;one&quot;&gt;[http://sportsanddrugs.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=002366 History of Performance Enhancing Drugs in Sports].&lt;/ref&gt;.  Athletes would use herbal medications, wine potions, hallucinogens, and eat animal hearts or testicles to improve their performance.   In the Late 19th Century, athletes would drink wine and coca leaves to prevent hunger and fatigue.  In the early 1900’s, it was common for Olympic athletes to mix drugs such as heroin, cocaine, and caffeine to increase performance.  In 1928, the International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF) prohibited doping of athletes&lt;ref name=&quot;one&quot; /&gt; . Coaches and teams could no longer train with &quot;secret-formulae&quot; as before.  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolic_steroid Anabolic Steroids] are the most commonly used performance enhancing drugs today.  They increase protein synthesis in cells which is naturally done by testosterone.  &lt;ref name = &quot;wiki&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolic_steroid Anabolic Steroids].&lt;/ref&gt;.  The synthetic hormone was best used for medical purposes dealing with normal growth, development, and sexual functioning &lt;ref name = &quot;cesear&quot;&gt;[http://www.cesar.umd.edu/cesar/drugs/steroids.asp Anabolic Steroids].&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1930’s and early 1940’s, it was speculated that the Nazi army used steroids to increase aggression and stamina of soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiki&quot;/&gt;  The drug was also used to help malnourished victims and soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;cesear&quot;/&gt;   After the more precise steroid was created, athletes began to use steroids to build muscle and increase stamina. After many years of struggling to regulate steroid usage, the first act of Congress was the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 1990 and 2004.  &lt;ref name=&quot;one&quot; /&gt;   

==='''Baseball'''===
[[File:Aprettylittlepocketbook.jpg|200px|thumb|The 1744 reference to baseball from &quot;A Pretty Little Pocket-Book&quot;]] 
Baseball originated in England as a similar game called “rounders.” “Rounders” was played much like baseball, but the rules were not established so the game changed often.&lt;ref name=&quot;baseballhist&quot;&gt;[http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/ebookviewer/ebook/nlebk_20192_AN?sid=f5580bb4-4620-49c6-a258-196ea7e38c75@sessionmgr114&amp;vid=1 History of Baseball]&lt;/ref&gt;. Abner Doubleday is commonly thought of as the father of modern baseball, but as early as 1744 young boys were calling the sport “base-ball” in both England and America.  &lt;ref name=&quot;baseballbegan&quot;&gt;[http://site.ebrary.com/lib/uvalib/docDetail.action?docID=10142045 Baseball:The Early Years]&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Some also place [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Cartwright Alexander Cartwright] as the founder of baseball in the early 1840s because of his involvement with the first organized team, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knickerbockers New York Knickerbockers]. &lt;ref name=&quot;baseballbegan&quot;/&gt;.  The actual founder of baseball is debated by many because of the long history of the sport.  After the pioneering, social teams, baseball became a professional sport with the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Red_Stockings Cincinnati Red Stockings] started in 1869.  &lt;ref name=&quot;baseballhist&quot;/&gt;.  

[[File:1869-cincinnati-red-stockings.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Cincinnati Red Stockings in 1869:The first professional team]]

The National and American Leagues would be started in the following years.  By the 1920s, fans were able to listen to baseball by radio.  Baseball grew even more with the development of the television in the 50s.&lt;ref name=&quot;baseballhist&quot;/&gt;.
More teams were added in both leagues because of the growing demand.  
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the 1920s, not only did radios make baseball more popular, but star players like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babe_Ruth Babe Ruth] became popular.  Babe Ruth was on the New York Yankees when he built his strong slugging record. &lt;ref name=&quot;baseballw&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball Baseball]&lt;/ref&gt;.  The 1930s was also a time for women, children, and minorities to start to play baseball.  Jackie Robinson was the first to break the color barrier on the Brooklyn Dodgers.&lt;ref name = &quot;baseballw&quot;/&gt;  Modern baseball includes star players such as Alex Rodrigez, Mark McGwire, and Sammy Sosa.  

Baseball is known as “America’s passtime” because of its rich history and longevity.  
&lt;br/&gt;

=='''Supporters and Detractors'''==

There are number of social groups that impact the socio-technical interface of steroid use in baseball.   It is not only important to look at the influence of these groups, but we need to understand why these groups acted at this interface.  The issue of steroid use in baseball is a socially constructed debate where power comes from control of people’s perception of the drug.  The groups which have the potential to influence the debate are: players, managers and owners, fans, the media, and recently congress.  

=== Detractors ===

One of the most outspoken people against steroid use in baseball was [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Helling Rick Helling].  He is not widely known, but he was the first to warn people in charge of baseball.  In 1998, he spoke to the player’s association, owners, and the executive board of the MLB and said that steroids were corrupting baseball and was ignored for 7 years until the Mitchell report was released.   He believed steroids were bad because of how it affected players that were morally good&lt;ref name=&quot;The Man Who Warned Baseball&quot;&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1881350-1,00.html The Man Who Warned Baseball]&lt;/ref&gt;.  He saw players taking steroids not to gain an edge but to keep from falling behind.  

&quot;Do I feel cheated?... All the non-users feel cheated. I think in a silent way, a lot of people who hadn't cheated over the years are happy with the way the media exposed the problem, and they're happy we're making progress toward evening the playing field.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Kent&quot;&gt;[http://www.baseballssteroidera.com/bse-memorable-quotes-steroid-related.html Jeff Kent],Quote Source: San Francisco Chronicle, Mar. 3, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

This quote from Jeff Kent embodies the integrity that has been missing in baseball.  The problem he is referring to is about people’s perception of steroid use in baseball.  In the early 1990’s, fans and managers were blissfully unaware or they intentionally turned a blind eye.  Neither group questioned what players did behind closed doors.  The use of drugs has developed a stigma that can tarnish a player’s reputation and the sport’s image as a whole.  Many players oppose drug use because it disrupts the fairness of the game not because of the negative side effects of steroids&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/96ssm.html The Social Construction of Drug Debates]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Chad Curtis, a former player, held the same regard for integrity in baseball as Helling and Kent, but he made it known why he abstained from steroid use.

&quot;There are two things that might stop a person from using steroids: a moral obligation -- they're illegal -- and a fear of the medical complications. I was 100 percent against the use of steroids. But I must tell you, I would not fear the medical side of it. I fully agree you can take them safely.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Curtis&quot;&gt;[http://www.baseballssteroidera.com/bse-memorable-quotes-steroid-related.html Chad Curtis],Quote Source: Sports Illustrated Magazine, June 3, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supporters ===

The integrity of baseball has been questionable since the early days of baseball (see: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sox_Scandal Black Sox Scandal]).  The goal of MLB during the steroid era was to make money.  The face of this era is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juiced:_Wild_Times,_Rampant_%27Roids,_Smash_Hits_%26_How_Baseball_Got_Big Jose Canseco], whose career was self-admittedly successful due to steroid use.  

&quot;The players and owners disagree on most things, but when it comes to making money, they're on the same page.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Canseco&quot;&gt;[http://www.baseballssteroidera.com/bse-memorable-quotes-steroid-related.html Jose Canseco],Quote Source: Canseco at Congressional Hearing, March 17, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Canseco was not entirely untrue, since there was an increase in attendance of 20 million fans from 1995-1998 across the entire league&lt;ref name=&quot;Attendance&quot;&gt;[http://www.ballparksofbaseball.com/1990-99attendance.htm MLB Attendance Figures from 1990-1999]&lt;/ref&gt;.  Players would use steroids to get a larger paycheck and secure a spot on the team.  Steroids would earn them millions of dollars instead of having to retire or be cut.  In 1998, Bud Selig, the commissioner, had Robert Millman, MLB chief medical adviser, talk to the players association at the same meeting that Helling brought up steroid corruption&lt;ref name=&quot;The Man Who Warned Baseball&quot; /&gt;.

&quot;There is no evidence andro (anabolic steroids) does anything bad or good.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Millman&quot;&gt;[http://www.baseballssteroidera.com/bse-memorable-quotes-steroid-related.html Robert Millman],Quote Source: Washington Post, Dec. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

MLB had effectively eliminated the public’s concern for steroids in baseball for the time being.  

=== Impact on Fans ===

	After confessions from [http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=qSVIOZkjY-Q McGwire], Canseco, Caminiti, and Giambi, public outcry about cheating and rampant steroid use in baseball caused fans to discredit recent records by Barry Bonds.  In 2008, 70% of fans believed that at least one out of every four players were using steroids to enhance their performance&lt;ref name=&quot;Survey of Fans in 2008 about Steroids&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2008/03/31/sports/20080331_POLL_GRAPHIC.html Survey of Fans in 2008 about Steroid Use in Baseball]&lt;/ref&gt;.  The prestige and moral order of baseball was replaced by shame and distrust.  Due to the emotional connection fans have with players, some fans can feel betrayed by players who cheat.  Fans were asked if players implicated with steroid use such as, Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens – both of whom have hall of fame caliber resumes, should be allowed into the hall of fame, their response was the following:  40% said Bonds should not be allowed and 31% said Clemens should not be allowed&lt;ref name=&quot;Survey of Fans in 2008 about Steroids&quot; /&gt;.  

=== Role of the Media ===

The media was a major factor in exposing those who used steroids.  Few openly admitted usage&lt;ref name=&quot;Admitted Steroid Users&quot;&gt;[http://www.baseballssteroidera.com/list-admitted-users.htm Admitted Steroid Users]&lt;/ref&gt; and many were implicated through trainers and team employees&lt;ref name=&quot;Implicated Steroid Users&quot;&gt;[http://www.baseballssteroidera.com/list-implicated-players.htm Implicated Steroid Users]&lt;/ref&gt;, but the shame and humiliation of seeing celebrity athletes being questioned in court had the most impact on the public.  The Congressional hearing on steroids in baseball was televised allowing the public to see baseball’s former superstars try to avoid the consequences of their actions.  In a sport where stealing is a recorded statistic, it is no wonder deception is a big part of the game on and off the field.

=='''Social Implications'''==

Many athletes participate in sports for the opportunity to pit their abilities against those of their peers, and to experience the satisfaction that comes from playing to their potential. Others do so for a desire for recognition and fame&lt;ref name=&quot;two&quot;&gt;[http://www.health.ny.gov/publications/1210/1210.pdf Anabolic Steroids in Sports].&lt;/ref&gt;. Despite evidence of steroids causing possible physical harm and significant side effects, some athletes are determined to win at any cost. The fact that baseball offers guaranteed contracts, players are provided the incentive to ignore health risks and attempt to cash in. Diamondback Craig Counsell stated, “if you can get an advantage somewhere, even if it involved crossing an ethical line, people will do it. Home runs are money &lt;ref name=&quot;three&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A24530-2002May28 Shipley, A. (2002, May 29). Baseball players say steroid use is heavy. Washington Post, p. D01].&lt;/ref&gt;.” One professional sports icon stated “the message that (steroids) sends is definiately not a positive one: I can do steroids and make $250 million &lt;ref name=&quot;ten&quot;&gt;[http://www.chron.com/sports/astros/article/Baseball-s-steroid-issue-calls-ethics-into-1743395.php Baseball's steroid issue calls ethics into question].&lt;/ref&gt;.” Many professional athletes know that kids at high schools and youth sports levels look up to them and “what they do ultimately filters down &lt;ref name=&quot;ten&quot; /&gt;.” 
&lt;br /&gt;

==='''Impact on Youth'''===
Several factors in our society might contribute to children and young adults using steroids to achieve athletic success.  First is the message that is being sent by many sports idols today. Recent [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banned_substances_in_baseball_in_the_United_States steroid investigations] in baseball make it clear that steroids have played a part in record-breaking performances. However, the fame athletes get when on steroids sends the message that steroids are accepted, if not necessary, to reach such success. Society places emphasis on sports at the collegiate level with stadiums seating thousands of fans and countless events televised nationally. From championship games to Little League World Series, our youth is placed under national spotlight at exceedingly young ages. College and professional sport recruiters are scouting out younger talent, and the pressure to succeed is high&lt;ref name=&quot;scouting&quot;&gt;[http://www.guidetocoachingsports.com/scouting.htm Scouting Little League Baseball Talent].&lt;/ref&gt;. Economic factors encourage steroid use to gain an edge in sports. The money and social status that accompanies athletic success when granted a professional contract is highly appealing to young athletes &lt;ref name=&quot;alex&quot; /&gt;. Another more subtle but increasingly wide-reaching monetary influence is the rising cost of collegiate education. Whether steroids are used for the competitive edge or as a mean of keeping up with fellow peers, our youth is beginning to use steroids at exceedingly young ages. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Recent study indicated that 6.6% of 12th grade male students use or have used anabolic steroids and that over two thirds of the user group initiated use when they were 16 years or age or younger&lt;ref name=&quot;seven&quot;&gt;[http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/260/23/3441.abstract Estimated Prevalence of Anabolic Steroid Use Among Male High School Seniors].&lt;/ref&gt;. Approximately 21% of users reported health professional was their primary source &lt;ref name=&quot;seven&quot; /&gt;. The current strategy for dealing with performance enhancing drug use by adolescents is multifaceted and primarily involves education and prevention strategies and drug testing programs. Although adolescent boys, particularly those involved in athletics such as football or bodybuilding, make up the majority of high school steroid users, national surveys show that adolescent girls are also vulnerable to the lure of steroid use &lt;ref name=&quot;five&quot;&gt;[http://archives.drugabuse.gov/NIDA_Notes/NNVol12N4/Steroid.html NIDA].&lt;/ref&gt;. Girls take steroids for a variety of reasons, but most prominent is to get more lean body mass. Studies show that teens that use or have used steroids were significantly more likely to practice other health-harming behaviors, including smoking, drinking, and using marijuana &lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot;&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Healthday/story?id=4507434&amp;page=1#.TtLUpnNl0jF ABC News Health].&lt;/ref&gt;.

=='''Conclusion'''==
The issues of steroid use in baseball stresses how technology doesn’t define the culture, it reflects it. Society’s image of the ideal body and “winning at any cost” attitude is shaped largely by forces outside the chalked lines. For effective change to be implemented, the culture surrounding baseball needs to be addressed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Elizabeth Neufeld ==

Elizabeth Neufeld was a geneticist whose work mainly focused on mucopolysaccharides. Her main accomplishments were accidentally finding corrections in biological defects that led to therapies for metabolic disorders and the possible connection of Sanfilippo syndrome and Alzheimer disease.

&lt;u&gt;Early in Life&lt;/u&gt; 

Elizabeth Neufeld was born in Paris but moved to New York in 1940. She attended Joan of Arc Junior High School and went on to Hunter High Schoool. Her favorite class was Latin and in high school she was first introduced to biology. She attended Queens community college and  took almost every science class that was available. Soon after, she received a position at Jackson Lab located in Bar Harbor Maine and was an assistant for Elizabeth (Tibby) Russel. Russel was a mouse geneticist and assigned Neufeld to study the variability of blood cells among mouse strains. She also took part in studies with mouse mutants at the W locus point with severely impaired Hematopoiesis.She began graduate school at the university of Rochester but left after a year due to the death of her father. After that she volunteered at the Institute of De Broglie Physico Chimique. She was hired a s a technician at the McCollum-Pratt Institute and worked on pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase, an enzyme purified from pseudomonas and beef heart whose mechanism was unknow. She asked the Professor Kaplan to become his grad  student but he refused and said &quot;women were not happy in grad school.&quot; Kaplan did recommend her to his friend at UC Berkely, W.Z. Hassid.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;u&gt;UC Berkeley&lt;/u&gt;

Neufeld was enroled as a student at UC Berkeley and worked with starches and glycogen. she found a paradox in her research of a mechanism that catalyzed the transfer of glucose 1-phosphate to the outer branches of a primer amylopectin and glycogen. The product of the reaction was called amylose because it resembled the blue color of natural emylose when mixed with Iodine. The paradox of her reaction was that the product was shorter than what was expected but still gave off a blue color. The reason for this was the confusion of naming the product Amylose and natural Amylose. they were thought to be the same thing but were in fact different. From her research she awarded a PhD.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;u&gt;After Berkeley&lt;/u&gt;

After leaving Berkeley, Neufeld joined the lab of Daniel Mazias and his research on sea urchin eggs. Her task was to verify that the cycle of a fertilized egg was associated with changes in cellular concentration of non protein sulfhydryl groups.She in fact found no change and left this lab to join up with Victor Ginsburg. Together they discovered pyrophosphorylases and empirases that would catalyze the synthesis of UDP sugars in mung bean extracts. Soon after, Neufeld went to work with David Feingold and together they synthesized polymers important to place cell walls. They found when plants were injured they produced callose. They also worked with several other reactions like UDP decarboxylatin to UDP - xylose and UDP epimirization to UDP - galacturonic acid which were assumed to be precursors to complex cell wall polymers. This period in time was one of the happiest in her life.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Hurler and Hunter Syndrome&lt;/u&gt;

Both Hurler and Hunter syndrome are metabolic disorders in which the degradation of mucopolysaccharides in inhibited. Fribroblasts from Hurler cells were similar to those in Hunter cells. Cells with these disorders have an influx of mucopolysaccharides and were first believed that mucopolysaccharides were being over synthesized. When tested, radioactivity in Hurler and Hunter cells continued to increase linearly while normal cells leveled off after 4 hours. This proved previous theories of the syndromes being lysosomal disorders. But soon they accidentally discovered how to correct the disorders in cultured environments.When analyzing Hurler and Hunter cells, they were both accidentally mixed and were allowed to culture. When tested, the mixed culture showed the normalization of normal cells and did not increase linearly past four hours. The then created intentional mixtures of hunter-hurler, hunter-normal and hurler-normal and to their surprise they all showed normal cell patterns. This kicked off the idea that if corrections could be made in mucopolysaccharide metabolism in cultured environments, then therapies could be made to help patients with these diseases. The cells secreted corrective factors to one another. If the culture corrected itself then it was assumed that the cells were of different genotypes and if the cells did not then they were of the same genotypes. It also showed mucopolysaccharide accumulation in cells deficient in B-glucuronidase coulde be fixed by the addition of B-glucuronidase. This was later called Sly syndrome and helped support the corrective factors hypothesis that Hurler and Hunter Syndromes were lysosomal enzymes missing in deficient cells which were unknown during this discovery. It was soon found that Hurler patients were deficient in α-L-iduronidase activity
and correction was accomplished by the uptake of phenyl - α-L-iduronidase. Although things looked bright, not all uptake was corrective. this suggested that there were specific structural elements on the enzyme that was required for uptake.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;u&gt;mannose-6-phosphate and treatments for α-L-Iduronidase Deficiency &lt;/u&gt;

Neufeld was analyzing β-hexosaminidase to search for the uptake structure but was beat to the finish line when another scientist discovered the uptake for  β-glucuronidase structure to be mannose-6-phosphate. This modification was previously unknown in mammalian cells. A canine model was soon found and the opportunities for therapies looked bright. They used canine and human cDNA to produce recombinant DNA on Chinese ovarian hamster cells. The cells secreted a mannose-6-phosphate signal and was highly corrective in cultured fibroblasts. the enzyme proved useful in  clearing glycoasminoglycn from many organs and had short and long term effects. Recombinant α-L-iduronidase enzyme was used to treat α-L-iduronidase deficiency disease and was soon approved by the FDA. The FDA also approved the mannose-6-phosphate corrective system for Hunter and Maroteaux-Lamy Syndromes. These therapies looked bright but there were a few problems. First of all not all tissue were equally correctable by the enzymes. Also, the central nervous system would not respond to the injected enzyme because blood-brain barrier prevented the enzyme from entering the brain. A solution to the blood-brain barrier problem was to use Hematopoietic stem cells. The stem cells helped maintain mental development in patients with severe Hurler Syndrome when performed early enough in life. The treatment was implemented using cells of moncyte/macrophage lineage because these cells could cross the blood-brain barrier. These cells believed to correct neurons by either secreting α-L-iduronidase or replacing deficient microglia with healthy microglia.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Neufeld and the Sanfilippo Syndrome&lt;/u&gt;

The Sanfilippo Syndrome was also a muccopolysaccharide stoarge disease that involved manifestations in the brain. There are four types of Sanfilippo Syndrome and Neufeld worked with type B because it enzyme, α-N-acetylglucosaminidase, was the easiest to analyze and purify.They used a mouse model and discovered something odd. They found a sixfold increase in mRNA lysozymes in the affected mouse than in the normal mouse. The lysozyme was related resembled the tau protein which needed to be phosphorylated. During phosphorylation, the lysozyme protein was hyperphosphorylated and showed similar characteristics to hyperphosphorylated tau found in patients with Alzheimer disease. When antibodies were used, the lysozyme was stained similar to the hyperphosphorylated tau protein. She accidentally found a link in Sanfilippo syndrom and Alzheimer disease and opened doors for potential therapies to both diseases.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction to Hurler Syndrome ==
[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Hurler syndrome has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.]]
Hurler syndrome, also known as mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a genetic disorder, inherited in an autosomal recessive manner,  that 
results in the buildup of glycosaminoglycans (formerly called mucopolysaccharides). It is associated with storage and urinary excretion of the mucopolysaccharides dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. 

Persons with Hurler syndrome do not make a substance called lysosomal alpha-L-iduronidase, an enzyme responsible for the degradation of mucopolysaccharides in lysosomes. This enzyme helps break down long chains of sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans. These molecules are found throughout the body, often in mucus and in fluid around the joints. Without this enzyme, a buildup of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate occurs in the body. 

== Symptoms ==

Symptoms of Hurler syndrome most often appear between ages 3 and 8. Infants with severe Hurler syndrome appear normal at birth. Facial symptoms may become more noticeable during the first 2 years of life.

Symptoms include:
# Abnormal bones in the spine
# Claw hand
# Cloudy corneas
# Deafness
# Halted growth
# Heart value problems
# Joint disease, including stiffness
# Mental retardation that gets worse over time
# Thick, coarse facial features with low nasal bridge

== Signs and tests ==
# Genetic testing for the alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) gene
# Urine tests for extra mucopolysaccharides
# X-ray of the spinal cord 

== Treatment ==

Enzyme replacement therapy adds a working form of the missing enzyme to the body. Bone marrow transplant has been used in several patients with this condition. The treatment has had mixed results. Other treatments depend on the organs that are affected.

== Classification ==

MPS I is divided into three subtypes based on the severity of symptoms. All of the MPS types are due to the lack of the enzyme α-L-iduronidase. MPS I H or Hurler syndrome is the most severe of the three. The other two types are  Scheie syndrome and Hurler-Scheie syndrome. Hurler syndrome is often classified as a lysosomal storage disease, and is clinically related to Hunter Syndrome. Hunter is X-linked while Hurler is autosomal recessive.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Hurler Syndrome&lt;br /&gt;

Hurler syndrome is an inherited disease that associates with storage and urinary excretion of mucopolysaccharides dermatan sulfate and heparin sulfate. People who get Hurler syndrome cannot break down long sugar molecules called mucopolysaccharides or glycosaminoglycans – GAGs – due to alpha-L-iduronidase deficiency, a lysomosal enzyme responsible for degradation of glycosaminoglycans. GAGs can build up in the lysosomes of the brain, heart, liver, bones and other organs of the body.The accumulation of GAGs in human body results in damages to organs.

'''Symptoms'''&lt;br /&gt;

* Abnormal bones
* Cloudy corneas
* Deafness
* Short stature
* Heart diseases
* Joint disease, including stiffness
* Mental retardation
* Thick, coarse facial features, i.e. Low nose bridge, flat face, large head
* Enlarged liver and spleen
* Diarrhea
* Breathing difficulties and snoring
Child with Hurler syndrome appears normal at birth. The symptoms start to appear between 6 months and 2 years of age and most often between ages 3 and 8. Most people with Hurler syndrome can not survive beyond age 10.

'''Treatment'''&lt;br /&gt;

A therapy called enzyme replacement was developed to tackle Hurler syndrome. Alpha-L-iduronidase cDNA in human and canine was used to made recombinant enzyme in Chinese hamster ovary cells. These cells secreted alpha-L-iduronidase with mannose 6-phosphate signal. Mannose 6-phosphate is a carbohydrate modification, which inhibits alpha-L-iduronidase uptake. The recombinant enzyme was tested in alpha-L-iduronidase-deficient dogs. It degraded GAGs from many organs in both short term and long term experiment. The recombinant enzyme was later tested on human and approved by FDA in 2003.

Even though having been proven to be effective, the enzyme replacement treatment has some limitations. Not all tissues are equally correctible. Mucopolysaccharides stored in central nervous system are not accessible by the enzyme due to the blood-brain barrier. Lastly, enzyme replacement treatment is very costly, about half a million dollars a year. 

Another therapy for Hurler syndrome, transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells, is available. This method helps maintain the normal mental development. The therapy is only effective if it is performed early enough in life. Another limitation of this treatment is that it is risky.

Child with Hurler syndrome appears normal at birth. The symptoms start to appear between 6 months and 2 years of age and most often between ages 3 and 8. Most people with Hurler syndrome can not survive beyond age 10.

==Background Info==

The Hurler Syndrome was first tackled by a researcher named Elizabeth F. Neufeld in the late 1960s. Initially, Neufeld linked the cause of the disease to the polymers of chondroitin sulfate B and heparitin sulfate, but due to their dissimilar chemical structures, it was very difficult to determine defects. She later hypothesized that excessive synthesis of mucopolysaccharide chains and excess of UDP-glucuronic acid, caused by defective UDP-xylose responses, were the causes. However, she was proven wrong when inhibiting the UDP-glucose dehydrogenase had no effect on the experimental cell culture she set up. Her hypothesis was again proven wrong when she used the radioactivity of (35)SO4 onto macromolecules with high solubility to measure the content of mucopolysaccharides. The mucopolysaccharide content in the cells of a Hurler patient did not decrease, whereas it did with the samples of a normal persons. As a result of these two experiments, Neufeld was later able to conclude that the Hurler syndrome was a lysosomal storage disease caused by the inability of breaking down mucopolysaccharides. 

==Treatments==

A therapy called enzyme replacement was developed to tackle Hurler syndrome. Alpha-L-iduronidase cDNA in human and canine was used to made recombinant enzyme in Chinese hamster ovary cells. These cells secreted alpha-L-iduronidase with mannose 6-phosphate signal. Mannose 6-phosphate is a carbohydrate modification, which inhibits alpha-L-iduronidase uptake. The recombinant enzyme was tested in alpha-L-iduronidase-deficient dogs. It degraded GAGs from many organs in both short term and long term experiment. The recombinant enzyme was later tested on human and approved by FDA in 2003.

Even though having been proven to be effective, the enzyme replacement treatment has some limitations. Not all tissues are equally correctible1. Mucopolysaccharides stored in central nervous system are not accessible by the enzyme due to the blood-brain barrier. Lastly, enzyme replacement treatment is very costly, half a million dollars a year1. 

Another therapy for Hurler syndrome, transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells, is available. This method helps maintain the normal mental development. The therapy is only effective if it is performed early enough in life. Another limitation of this treatment is that it is risky.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Organisms that live in perpetually cold environments have enzymes that function very effectively in the cold. Some examples of this include fish, which have also evolved to develop antifreeze proteins as a way of adapting, and some prokaryotes that have to live in cold places. Recent discoveries have uncovered that further investigation of these enzymes could actually have biotechnological applications. The most commonly referred to cold-adapted enzyme is the alpha amylase from Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis (AHA), a type of prokaryote. 
The ability of organisms to thrive in cold environments comes from their capacity to synthesize cold-adapted enzymes. Organisms that thrive in cold environments are called psychrophiles. These enzymes have developed a range of structural features that allows for high flexibility particularly around the active site, low-activation enthalpy, low-substrate affinity, and high specific activity at low temperatures. The study of the structure, function, and stability of cold-adapted enzymes is rudimentary in the research into protein folding and catalysis, a still developing field.

== Thermal adaptation ==
Different organisms have evolved in different ways, causing them to adapt to different thermal environments that suits them. Thermal adaptation in extremes is particularly hard to adapt to and has a limited range that an individual organism can tolerate. Psychrophilic microorganisms, those that have adapted to the cold, are said to be able to metabolize in snow and ice at −20°C. Some psychrophilic can even proliferate at ≤0°C but are restricted to temperatures  &lt;30°C (2–5). 

Since there are so many microorganisms found in the world's oceans, cold alpine regions, caves, upper atmosphere, and polar regions, a large proportion of biomass, or living organisms in a certain region, on Earth is generated at these cold temperatures in their specific areas. Organisms from the three domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eucarya, are also from these cold environments. Most cold-adapted enzymes are found to have come from prokaryotes.  In order to survive, all these organisms have to be at thermal equilibrium with their surrounding environment. This comes from all the components of their cells being appropriately adapted to the cold. In order to adapt to the cold, potential mechanistic diversity  and cell-specific adaptation strategies have been adopted. A general pattern that has emerged from research of these organisms is that organisms that live in permanently cold environments usually develop enzymes that help them function capably in the cold

[[File:3 domains of life.GIF‎]]

An example of a cold-adapted enzyme which will be further studied and explained is the α-amylase from Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis (AHA). This enzyme is the most extensively studied cold-adapted enzyme

== Activity of Cold-Adapted Enzymes ==
Arrhenius equation below describes the rate of all reactions including enzymatic reactions. 

''k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;'' = AKe&lt;sup&gt;-E&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sup&gt;RT&lt;/sup&gt;

''k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;'' = enzyme reaction rate (increases with an increase in absolute temperature (T), decreases in activation energy (Ea)

A = preexponential factor

K = dynamic transmission coefficient (generally assumed to be 1)

R = universal gas constant (8.314 J mol−1 K−1)

According to this equation,  due to low temperatures from 0°–4°C, an inadequate amount of  kinetic energy is available for the system to overcome barriers. Some  strategies that help compensate the slow metabolic rates include: an energetically expensive strategy of increasing enzyme concentration, seasonal expression of isoenzymes in fish and nematodes, and the evolution of enzymes in which reaction rates tend to become more  temperature independent and instead approach diffusion control. Cold-adapted enzymes tend to shift their optimum temperature of activity to a lower temperature with a concurrent decrease in stability. These enzymes show a high-reaction rate when they decrease their activation free-energy barrier between the ground state and transition states according to the equation below:

ΔG#=ΔH# -TΔS#
 
ΔG#  = activation free-energy barrier

ΔH# = is the change in activation enthalpy

ΔS# = is the change in activation entropy

T = is the absolute temperature

== Stability of Cold-Adapted Enzymes ==

	The structure of cold-adapted enzymes are highly flexible which allows them to unfold at low to moderate temperatures. Researches have tried many methods to study the unfolding and folding transitions in order to determine the way they unfold and measure the kinetic and conformational stabilities of enzymes. Such methods include spectrophotometric, calorimetric, and electrophoretic methods. Experiments have been conducted using these techniques on multidomain proteins like chitobiase. Proteins have a tendency to unfold and such processes are irreversible. When large multidomain proteins unfold due to heat, these proteins tend to be kinetically driven to finish the unfolding process. 

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:PDB 1c7t EBI.jpg|Structure of Chitobiase
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The only example of a cold-adapted enzyme that has reversible unfolding is AHA. At temperatures of 20°C or above, AHA has reversible unfolding that is shown by 100% recovery of ΔH cal., the total amount of heat absorbed during unfolding, during a second scan after the initial thermal denaturation. Small-molecular weight enzymes unfold with the process of cooperative unfolding. Cooperative unfolding happens because of its tightly packed bulk which causes a small number of interactions between other structural elements, helping it conserve its natural state. If the limited number of interactions in cooperative unfolding were to be disturbed, a two-state unfolding may occur due to increased interactions. 

	In the enzyme pancreatic porcine α-amylase (PPA) and more stable mutants of AHA, the two-state unfolding process does not occur. Instead, other types of folding  could come from increased ionic interactions, causing the frequency of intramolecular discrepancies to occur during folding. AHA mutants show this concept of discrepancies or divergence, causing the rate of thermal inactivation to be directly comparable to the extent of reversibility. 

	In the enzyme TUG-GE, at the temperatures 3°C and 12°C, AHA unfolds reversibly and shows two transitions. The transition that unfolds at a lower urea concentration belongs to the active-site region. The active site is formed by cooperative unfolding of structures, showing independent unfolding of other more stable regions, or the domains, of the protein.. The substrate-binding region of the cold-adapted enzyme is found to be the most flexible region when the unfolding starts due to its high Km. The research on AHA shows that instability of active-site region is key to heat-labile enzymes, and is an important concept in examining a broader range of cold-adapted enzymes

=== Kinetic Stability ===

The process of enzyme inactivation or denaturation is shown with kinetic stability. Most cold-adapted enzymes have a half-life of less than 20 minutes at the temperature of 50°C, some enzymes even denature at lower temperatures. In order to predict kinetic stability, it is essential to consider the magnitude of the free-energy change between the folded, or active, state and the transition state shown below by:

F  K¦↔ 〖TS〗^#  k¦→ D 

F = folded enzyme

K = equilibrium constant

K= first-order rate constant

D = denatured state

Cold-adapted enzymes increase the rate of thermal unfolding with a decreased ΔG# shown by the equation:

ΔG#= =RT ln K
 
Reduced thermostability of cold-adapted enzymes could be due to low ΔH# of the folded form. A certain number of monovalent interactions need to be broken to reach transition state (TS#) and a reduction in this number causes the low number of the folded form. An example of an enzyme that has low thermostability, a direct result from increased disorder of the transition state, is the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase. During unfolding, a key note to the decreased entropy of thermostable enzymes could have come about from the hydration of nonpolar groups. This is caused by water forming ordered structures around hydrophobic side chains thus decreasing the entropy o the system. It is vital to determine activation parameters of denaturation in order to discover a larger range of cold-adapted enzymes and their thermostable homologs.

== Flexibility and Structural adaptation ==

X-ray structures of cold-adapted enzymes have been discovered to show the structural basis of cold adaptation by comparing these x-ray structures with homology models of proteins from mesophiles and thermophiles. An important factor to the activity and stability of a enzyme is its physiological environment. Studies have also shown that mainly marine organisms have been used to study cold-adapted enzymes. The X-ray structure of enzyme citrate synthase has been determined and compared to other enzymes of Bacteria, Eucarya, and Achaea. Due to the absence of crystal structure information, studies generally choose closely related organisms. By maximizing thermal differences and minimizing phylogenetic differences in comparative data sets, the lack of x-ray structures for enzymes can be countered. 

=== Hydrophobic Interactions ===
Hydrophobic interactions between hydrophobic residues and solvent water molecules play a key role in contributing to the structural flexibility and thermostability of cold-adapted proteins. 

=== Core hydrophobicity ===
Cold-adapted enzymes have amino acids that tend to be smaller and less hydrophobic than in homologs from mesophiles and thermophiles. Since Van der Waals interactions are weak, have short range, and distance sensitive, the distance between hydrophobic groups inside a protein will determine the enthalpic contributions to stabilization. Reduced van der Waals interactions and increased movement of internal groups will therefore destabilize cold-adapted enzymes. An example of a group inside a protein is Ille. Ille can pack efficiently inside the core and stabilize a protein due to tis branching and size. In the cold-adapted trypsins, citrate synthase, and AHA, fewer Ille residues can pack inside the core. 

Hydrophobic interactions are strongest at room temperature due to the solubilities of hydrophobic side chains in water having it be at the minimal temperature 20°C. Through a study with 31 proteins that unfold reversibly, it was found that about 75 % had maximum stability around room temperature. This shows that hydrophobic interactions in the core of a protein play a key role in enhancing protein stability at low to moderate temperatures.

=== Surface hydrophobicity ===
A higher proportion of hydrophobic, or nonpolar, residues occur on the surfaces of cold-adapted enzymes shown by studies with x-ray structures of many enzymes. Using large-scale modeling and structural studies, similar conclusions were found that demonstrated that the mean fraction of the solvent-accessible surface, or buried surface, of the enzyme has a higher hydrophobicity in cold-adapted proteins. In the X-ray structure of the example with Ille, it revealed that Ille clusters at the subunit interface are absent in the cold-adapted enzyme while tightly packed hydrophobic clusters are present in the homolog from a hyperthermophile. 

Studies have shown that hydrophobic surface residues will destabilize a protein structure due to the decreased entropy of water molecules because these water molecules form cage-like structures around nonpolar residues. It was found that at lower temperatures, the entropy gain is actually reduced due to the decreased mobility of released water molecules showing that cold-adapted enzymes may gain flexibility from and have a greater capacity to tolerate increased surface hydrophobicity. 

=== Surface Hydrophilicity ===
Certain cold-adapted enzymes like trypsins and β-lactamase (55) have had an increase in surface charge, mainly negative charge. For some enzymes, the negative charge is rather high but with some positive charge located near the active site. Due to high viscosity and high surface tension of water, at low temperatures, the energetic cost of disrupting H-bond networks is high. This energetic cost may be counter by surface-charged or polar amino acids that interact with water molecules with a high dielectric constant. This would then enable proper solvation and help maintain the flexibility of the enzymes. With better solvent interaction and positive charge, flexibility may be improve at low temperatures. 

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:PDB_1os8_EBI.jpg‎|Structure of Trypsin&lt;/gallery&gt;

Localization of acidic residues in surface patches have the possibility of producing charge-charge repulsions that cause the overall destabilization  of protein structure. Sometimes the case arises where charge repulsion of acidic residues may create a high level of flexibility in the linker region, This is a major structural feature of cold adaptation in certain enzymes. Other studies have shown that cold adaptation involves a decrease in the mean fraction of solvent-accessible and buried surface that is charged. This involves other proteins from not only the Achaea family, but also Bacteria family causing and increase in surface Hydrophilicity in proteins. With increased surface charge in thermostable proteins, researchers have been able to link this to an ability to form networks of sat bridges. This directly contrasts the interaction with water molecules in cold-adapted enzymes. A direct correlation has been found that as ionic interactions become stronger with decreased temperature, a minimization of their number that allows cold-adapted proteins to retain flexibility at low temperatures occurs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Peptide Biosensor==
	Peptide biosensors are used to determine phosphorylation activities in cells. A biosensor is a device that provides information about the composition, structure and function of biological analytes such as isolated enzymes, immonosystems, tissues, and organelles by  converting a biological response into an electrical, thermal, or optical signals. The biosensors that are mainly used for the analysis of phosphorylation events incorporate the use of a synthetic fluorophore, the portion of a molecule that illuminates the color of the molecule. When the fluorophore interacts with a phosphorylated peptide or protein domain, the fluorescence properties of the complex changes. Fluorscence are dyes that emit a certain color when a molecule is exposed to light. In general, the emitted light is usually longer than that of the incident light. The complex causes an enhancement in fluorescence and this property is used to determine the phosphorylation event of an analyte.
&lt;ref&gt; Tarrant, M.K.; Cole, P.A.; [http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.biochem.78.070907.103047 The Chemical Biology of Protein Phosphorylation.&quot;] Annu. Rev. Biochem. 78 (2009): 797-825. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Peptide Biosensors==
====Environmentally Sensitive Biosensor====
	An environmentally sensitive biosensor detects phosphorylation activities that occur between a solute and a solvent molecule that forms relatively weak covalent bonds. In general, a domain that has a high affinity for binding to a phosphospecific amino acid attaches to a phosphorylated peptide or protein. This complex changes the polarity of the solvent in the fluorophore which increases the fluorescence of the molecule and the complex illuminates a noticeable color.[[File:Environment.png|thumb|Environmentally Sensitive Biosensor]]

====Deep-Quench Biosensor====
	A deep-quench biosensor utilizes a quencher that interacts with the fluorophore in the peptide. When this complex is phosphorylated, the biosensor employs a domain that has a high affinity for binding to a phosphospecific amino acid to separate the quencher from the fluorophore. This separation causes an increase in the fluorescence in the molecule.[[File:Quencher.png|thumb]]&lt;ref&gt; Tarrant, M.K.; Cole, P.A.; [http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.biochem.78.070907.103047 The Chemical Biology of Protein Phosphorylation.&quot;] Annu. Rev. Biochem. 78 (2009): 797-825. &lt;/ref&gt;

====Self-Reporting Sensors====
	A self-reporting sensors is a type of sensor that does not require the use of a domain that has a high affinity for binding to a phosphospecific amino acid in order to detect the presence of phosphorylated amino acid. This type of sensor is only applicable for amino acids that are aromatic, usually tyrosine. The pi bonds in the molecule enable the amino acid to quench the fluorophore in the peptide biosensor. When the molecular is phosphorylated, the aromatic amino acid cannot quench the flouorophore again.[[File:self.png|thumb]]

====Metal Chelation-Enhanced Fluorescence Biosensors====
	Metal chelation-enhanced fluorescence detects the presence of a phosphorylation event via Sox, a gene that encodes for a transcription factor that binds to the DNA. In addition being a sequence known the HMG box, Sox is also a fluorophore which can be intensified by chelation. Due to this unique property, Sox is used to determined phosphorylation activities in a system. In addition, metal chelation-enhanced fluorescence do not require the use of an acid-binding domain that has a high affinity for a phosphoamino acid.
	In the presence of a serine or threonine residue, Sox is capable of recruiting a phosphate group to gather, which elicits phosphorylation to occur. Once the serine or threonine residue has been phosphorylated via Sox, the peptide acquires a higher ability to bind to Mg2+ peptides. The binding of the Mg2+ to the phosphorylated serine or threonine residue generates a fluorescent signal. In addition, several probes such as PKC, Cdk2, and PKA have been created to increase the intensity of the fluorescent signal.

      <comment>/* Categorization of Protein-DNA Recognition */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There exists a variety of interactions between proteins and DNA that are necessary for biological processes, in which proteins must recognize specific sections of DNA. These interactions can be categorized by what the proteins use to recognize and interact with in DNA. Proteins use a combination of these interactions in order to achieve specificity in '''DNA binding'''.

==History==
It was previously thought, based on early low-resolution [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA/Franklin's DNA X-ray Crystallography|x-ray structures]],  that the set of nucleic acids present in the major groove of DNA helices presented a set of bases that correspond with a complementary sequence of amino acids for the sake of recognition specificity. This theory of recognition is referred to as direct readout. Although this mechanism of recognition is common and provides a significant amount of what is in the Protein Data Bank, it has been realized that simple one-to-one correspondence between codes is insufficient in recognizing the specificity of the protein-DNA interactions. In some cases of DNA recognition, interactions of the protein and the DNA strand are less direct, and the interactions are not likely to occur if not for some sort of deformation of the DNA helix conformation. These interactions are defined as indirect readout mechanisms.

==Categorization of Protein-DNA Recognition==
[[File:DNA Structure+Key+Labelled.pn NoBB.png|thumb|right|alt=Illustration of major and minor groove in DNA|Illustration of major and minor groove in DNA]]
The two main categories are base readout and shape readout. Base readout is when the protein recognizes the specific chemical signatures of different nucleic acid bases. Shape readout is the recognition of the shape of DNA sequences. 

===Base Readout===
Base readout can be further categorized into readouts that occur in the major groove versus those that occur in the minor groove. [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrogen bonds|Hydrogen bonding]] is one mechanism of DNA recognition by proteins; it is a greater source of specificity in the major groove as compared to the minor groove due to the pattern of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors available. In the minor groove, the hydrogen donor/acceptor patterns do not distinguish A:T from T:A and G:C from C:G. Specificity based on hydrogen bonds is based both on the number of donor-acceptor pairs and the unique hydrogen bonding geometry. When A:T bind together they make two hydogen bonds. When G:C bind together they make three hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonding has also been noted to be mediated by water molecules; for example, in the Trp repressor enzyme water molecules are found to bridge hydrogen bonds. However, this type of water-mediated hydrogen bonding mechanism of recognition has only been found in the case of major groove readout, not in cases of minor groove readout. 

Displacement of water molecules from the minor groove may also be used as a thermodynamic driving force for the binding of DNA. [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrophobic interaction|Hydrophobic effects]] may also be used in recognizing specific bases, like pyrimidine groups as compared to purine groups. Although hydrogen bonding is effective in recognizing purine bases, like adenine and guanine, contacts with pyrimidines are mainly hydrophobic. 
[[File:PDB 1p78 EBI.jpg|thumb|left|alt=This is an example of a DNA bend with protein 1p78|This is an example of a DNA bend with protein 1p78]]

===Shape Readout===
Shape readout can be divided into global and local shape recognition. Variations of DNA shape are dependent on the chemical interactions of each base pair, which results in a unique conformational signature. Specificity in readouts depends on variations from the usual B-DNA structure, and result in binding less ideal DNA conformations. 

Local shape readout is dependent on two main variations: narrow minor groove and DNA kinks. DNA kinks are when the helix's linearity is broken due to base pairs unstacking. This promotes optimal contact between the amino acid and DNA base.

Global shape readout is categorized as when the entire binding site of the DNA is not in the ideal B-DNA structure. Examples of these [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA/DNA structure#Secondary Structures of DNA|structures]] are A-DNA, bent DNA, and Z-DNA. In the A form of DNA, sugar structures that are typically not exposed are due to the expanded minor groove, and thus can contact nonpolar [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]], such as alanine, leucine, phenylaline, and valine. In Z-DNA, the position of the phosphate groups is recognized. For example, RNA adenosine deaminase recognizes the zig-zag phosphate patterns on the left handed helix.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry is a powerful tool with which protein/enzyme structure and interaction can be studied. This can also determine the location and orientation of protein and enzymes associated with phospholipids. 

This occurs based on the principle of hydrogen exchange with solvent. The hydrogen atoms on a protein molecule can be divided into three groups (1):&lt;br /&gt;

1) Hardly ever exchange (H that is attached directly to C)&lt;br /&gt;

2) Exchange extremely quickly (H that is attached to the side chain atom)&lt;br /&gt;

3) Exchange rate depends on the local environment (Amide Hydrogen N-H) (1)&lt;br /&gt;


The hydrogen atoms on a protein molecule that undergo exchange reaction can be followed experimentally used deuterated water. &lt;br /&gt;


The third process listed above, the amide hydrogen exchange is described as follows: &lt;br /&gt;

1) Incubated proteins in deuterated water are reacted with probes/perturbations to shows how it can influence the accessibility to water and therefore affect amid hydrogen exchange rates. It will only proceed smoothly and efficiently if the amide hydrogen is reacted in solvent water. As the name implies, hydrogens exposed to hydrophobic regions will need more time to exchange, and have an increased chance of not exchanging at all since efficiency is due to the amide hydrogen being in the solvent water. &lt;br /&gt;

2) The deuterium atoms can be &quot;locked in place&quot; to prevent further exchange (1)&lt;br /&gt;

3) High powered liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis then uses a protease, which is a catalyst, to digest/cleave the protein into its respective peptides, which are 5-15 amino acids in length. &lt;br /&gt;

4) Mass spectrometry is used to fragment those digested peptides into smaller pieces, which helps in identifying the peptide.&lt;br /&gt;


One limitation to this approach is that collision induced dissociation causes &quot;scrambling,&quot; where the deuterium atom changes conformation within the peptide (1). A method that reduces the chances of scrambling is electron transfer dissociation.&lt;br /&gt;
  

DXMS studies with two potent, specific, and reversible lipid inhibitors. These inhibitors provide very specific methods in docking, and when docked, the precise binding conformations of the inhibitors became defined. One of the specific and reversible inhibitors is substrate, and when this inhibitor is docked, it can provide an image of the conformation of a phospholipid molecular species bound in the active site of an enzyme (1). &lt;br /&gt;


DXMS could also be used in conjunction with phospholipid bilayer nanosdiscs to analyze membrane protein conformation. There have been complications in the past with studying in vitro systems by way of detergent micelles or liposomes. Detergent micelles often denature the membrane proteins due to their detergent nature. Liposomes form a mixture of small, large, and multilamellar vesicles which lead to inconsistent results (2). Nanodiscs, when used with DXMS, offers a solution to studying membrane proteins. &lt;br /&gt;


Nanodiscs are made with membrane scaffold protein, lipids, and the membrane protein in question mixed in a phospholipid/detergent solution (2). Detergent is removed in order for the nanodiscs to form on their own. The nanodisc allows the protein to remain in its natural conformation. The nanodiscs are then purified with size exclusion chromatogoraphy and the purified nanodiscs are subjected to the deuterated buffer multiple times(2). The DXMS needs to be carried out quickly in order to minimize deuterium loss from quenching. Three methods helped to ensure the success of the nanodiscs in conjunction with DXMS (2):&lt;br /&gt;

1) nanodisc disassembly by adding cholate (cholate is effective because it increases membrane scaffold protein peptides and protein digestion)  &lt;br /&gt;

2) zirconium oxide beads separates the phospholipids from the rest of the mixture  &lt;br /&gt;

3) optimized chromatography used to separate the membrane scaffold protein peptides from the membrane proteins peptides &lt;br /&gt;


DXMS in conjunction with nanodiscs allows the analysis of a protein in its natural conformation and ultimately the protein’s natural conformation leads to the understanding of its function.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic developed in 1963 to replace PCP and presently used in human anesthesia and veterinary medicine. Most of the ketamine that is sold on the street has been abstracted from veterinarians’ offices. Ketamine’s chemical structure and mechanism of action are similar to those of PCP. Although it is manufactured as an injectable liquid, in illicit use ketamine is generally evaporated to form a powder.
The ways it’s used is either snorted or swallowed. Ketamine is odorless and tasteless, so it can be mixed with beverages without being noticed, and it induces amnesia. Because of these properties, the drug is sometimes given to unsuspecting victims and used in the commission of sexual assaults referred to as “drug rape.”

The short term effect of Ketamine is that it can trigger dream-like states and hallucinations. Users report sensations ranging from a pleasant feeling of floating to being separated from their bodies. Some ketamine experiences involve a terrifying feeling of almost complete sensory detachment that is likened to a near-death experience. These experiences, similar to a “bad trip” on LSD, are called the “K-hole.” Low-dose intoxication from ketamine results in impaired attention, learning ability, and memory . In higher doses, ketamine can cause delirium, amnesia, impaired motor function, high blood pressure, depression, and potentially fatal respiratory problems.


==Overview==

Ketamine is a barbiturate anesthetic. It is designed as a slightly acidic (3.5-5.5 pH) solution that is administered through injection. Its chemical name is (±)-2-(o-Chlorophenyl)-2-(methylamino) cyclohexanone hydrochloride.
Ketamine goes by various names on the street. It has been known to be called K, Special K, Cat valium, or vitamin K. Ketamine is abused in both the liquid and solid form. The liquid form is usually injected intravenously and is the most dangerous way to consume. The solid form is used to be smoked, snorted or swallowed as a pill. Also, it is known to be added to drinks. Ketamine is legally used as an anesthetic for animals and humans, but it is commonly abused for pleasure.  &lt;ref name=&quot;Ketamine&quot;&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/archive/ndic/pubs4/4769/4769p.pdf Ketamine], October 28 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==

Ketamine has many powerful effects, which have made it a popular privately used drug. Some of its psychological effects include out of body experiences, hallucinations, numbness, euphoria, and nausea. All of these effects vary with dosage and tolerance. Ketamine effects can last up to 24 hours, but the hallucinations only about 45 to 90 minutes. 
Ketamine use is associated with severe mental and physical detriments. These effects can include: delerium, depression, high blood pressure and loss of motor functions. Ketamine has also been known to be used as a rape drug by incapacitating the user. It is sometimes spiked into other drugs or given to those ignorant of the drugs strength. &lt;ref name=&quot;ketamine&quot;&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/archive/ndic/pubs4/4769/4769p.pdf ketamine], October 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmacology==

Ketamine is a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist. The blocking of this receptor is believed to cause the pain relief one experiences while on Ketamine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Secrets of mitochondria discovered recently ==

Mitochondria are a power plant in our cell because it is programming cell death. Mitochondria also involved in signal transduction network; response to both signals from outside and emitted signals themselves. Several areas have been discovered recently. First, DNA of mitochondrial code is unusual. DNA can be replicated, transcribed, and goes to nucleoids. Second, Mitochondria and nuclear can communicate each other. Nucleus talk to mitochondria by imported proteins but still does not discovered how mitochondria talks back to nucleus. Third, mitochondrion relocates protein. Inter membrane space of mitochondrial can oxidize disulfide bridges from sulfhydryl groups even though surrounded environment is highly reduced. The free energy of ATP shocks protein from mitochondrial 70-kDa heat, and it hydrolysis to move proteins across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Fourth, mitochondria can be dividing and fuse by machine, some proteins. Every two mitochondrial membranes have their own shape changing machine to divide and fuse by itself. Last, our body still has maternally inherited from mitochondria DNA. Mitochondria specializes its energy and DNA of mitochondria are maternal. Mitochondrial DNA that uniparental inheritance helps to ensure harmful mutation to encoded subunits; oxidative phosphorylation system letting co-optimized by adaptive mutation from nuclear encoded partner subunits. Moreover, mitochondria still has lots of secrets we will discover even though we already discover many areas in mitochondria.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Background==

Microscopy is a technique that is oftentimes used to study the cell (inside and outside).  The two most common types of microscopy are light microscopy and electron microscopy.  


The three types of light microscopy are fluorescence, phase-contrast, and confocal.  

1) Fluorescence shows the location of molecules in the cell by tagging them with fluorescent dyes or antibodies.

2) Phase-contrast enhances contrast in cells by amplifying variations in density.

3) Confocal uses lasers and special optics to optically section fluorescently-stained cells.



The two types of electron microscopy are scanning and transmission.

1) Scanning shows a 3D image of the surface of a cell or specimen.

2) Transmission is used to section through a cell or specimen.



The difference between light microscopy vs. electron microscopy is that election microscopy uses a beam of electrons instead of light.

The key to excellent microscopy is magnification and resolution (clarity) to be able to see what you're trying to find in a cell.

==Scanning Electron Microscopy==

Scanning Electron Microscopy works by having an electron beam scan over the entire object.  This process can be related to a 3D scanner that takes the positioning data of each atom on the object to create a computer generated model that reflects the data.  This positioning data is retrieved by the detecting the collision behavior of the particles when an incoming electron causes the ejection, scattering, or excitation of other electrons.  Other data such as the velocity and amount of x-ray packets that are produced by electron scattering can also be used to provide more details for the computer model.  

In order to provide maximum magnifying capabilities for the microscope, an electromagnetic field is maintained by fluctuating voltage contained in copper coils surrounding critical portions of the beam.   This magnetic is used to maintain a very precise and linear beam of electrons to scan the object with.  These “scanning” coils are also what allows the beam to direct and adjust itself accordingly to properly scan the specimen.

Electron microscopy is particularly popular amongst scientists visualizing minute specimens, some of which are smaller than the smallest frequency of light physically smaller.  It is this inherent problem of light microscopy that prevents normal microscopes from viewing nanoscopic structures, since the “light” used to too big to view anything that small.  Given that the de Broglie wavelengths of electrons are capable of being created thousands of times shorter than normal light, electron beams are the preferred wave particles for observing molecular structures. 

==Atomic Force Microscopy==

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a type of high-resolution imaging with resolution on the nanometer scale. Interestingly, this is a resolution that is 1000 times more than the expected optical diffraction limit. The original AFM is a derivative of the scanning tunneling microscope that was engineered by Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer in Zurich, Sweden in the 1980s. Today, the AFM is widely used to investigate on the subcellular, nanometer scale. 

The AFM has a cantilever with a sharp tip at the end. This tip is used to scan the surface of interest, which is mounted on a glass surface. The cantilever is brought close to the surface of the sample. Tiny forces act on the principle of springs (Hooke's law) caused by interaction between the tip and the sample through chemical interactions such as van der waals, capillary forces, electrostatic forces, and magnetic forces to name a few. These various forces causes a measurable deflection of the cantilever. As the cantilever tip taps along the surface of the sample, the components of the cantilever is continuously measured in the x, y and z direction to create an image that is computationally constructed based on the amplitude, phase, and other features of the cantilever tip movement. From the tracking of the cantilever movement, the surface of the sample can be analyzed and 3D images can be produced such as amplitude and phase traces. 

Atomic Force Microscopy is widely used in the academic lab setting. A research group at the University of California, Davis headed by Dr. Tina Jeoh focuses on using atomic force microscopy to explore the surface chemistry and structure of cellulose, a polysaccharide component of the cell wall in plants. With the investigations of the cellulose structure, the aim is to access the mechanisms by which enzymes such as cellulases act on the cell wall to release soluble, fermentable sugars in order to optimize efficiency of converting the sugars into second generation cellulose-based biofuels. The group uses chemical vapor deposition with methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS) and centrifugation to adhere purified macro-algae based cellulose to silanized glass. The wet cellulose is imaged under AFM along with cellulase. The time-lapse AFM gives an insight to the mechanism by which cellulase breaks down cellulose into beta glucan rings through imaging.

==Transmission Electron Microscopy:==

Transmission Electron Microscopy operates similarly to scanning electron microscopy, but rather than letting an electron beam individually scan the surface of a specimen, the microscope takes electrons and transmits them through an ultra-thin specimen.  The resulting electron collisions are then detected by electron detectors to create a model of the imaged specimen.  Fundamentally, a Transmission Electron Microscope is similar to the Scanning variant, they only differ in how the image is created.  A disadvantage for this system is that it requires the creation of very thin specimens for the electron beam to pass through, which is a very meticulous and laborious process.  There is also the risk of damaging thin biological specimens with the beam.

==Electron Microscope (Scanning) Parts==

===Electron Gun===  
The electron source used to image the specimen with.  They come in two types.
'''Thermoionic:'''  
This type of electron source utilizes thermal energy in a filament to eject electrons from.
'''Field emission:'''  
Uses an electrical field to eject electrons

===Lenses===  
The lenses of a scanning electron microscope are the components that concentrate the electrons coming from the gun into a fine linear beam.  These lenses use magnetism rather than optical prisms to fine tune the electron beam.  
===Sample Chamber=== 
Specimens are stored within the sample chamber and provide a focal point for the electron gun as well as electron detectors.
===Detectors=== 
These line the sample chamber to observe any scattered electrons and any resulting rays from electron collisions.
===Vacuum Chamber=== 
The case for practically the entire electron microscope.  A vacuum is required to operate the electron microscope because anything less would cause unintended electron collisions and interference for the electron beam.

      <comment>/* Systemic siRNA delivery */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==RNA Based Drugs==

==RNAi Drugs== 

RNAi drugs are a relatively new class of drugs that rely on a mechanism known as RNA interference to inhibit or silence gene expression of certain genes . Specifically, RNAi drugs are made of synthesized small interfering RNA molecules (siRNAs) that recruit and inhibit expression of specific mRNA transcripts that code for a particular gene &lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, the strategy behind RNAi drugs towards the treatment of cancer is that by synthesizing siRNA molecules that bind to specific mRNAs responsible for cancer-causing genes, the siRNAs, by the mechanism of RNA interference, can inactivate that mRNA transcript coding for a harmful protein and thus inhibit the translation of that protein that contributes to the symptoms of cancer and disease. Because of the ability of siRNAs to degrade mRNAs and silence their genes, RNAi based drugs are being seen as a new and innovative approach to treating cancer. Possible indications for RNA-based therapeutics include HIV, macular degeneration, and the treatment of cancerous tumor cells.

==Systemic siRNA delivery==
Systemic siRNA delivery strategies can be divided into passive and active (targeted) delivery.

==Applications==
Since the discovery of RNA interference in 2002, scientists have been actively investigating the potential of RNA interference to inhibit the expression of harmful or cancerous genes that are responsible for a variety of human diseases and cancers. For instance, scientists began to exploit RNA interference for the treatment of macular degeneration, which is a condition caused by the over-production of the VEGF gene in the eye and leads to the excess growth of blood vessels behind the retina that can eventually cause blindness. &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; Thus, scientists initially sought to use RNAi drugs as a way to turn off the overactive VEGF gene in the eye. 

Another potential use of RNAi has been actively investigated in the treatment of HIV and is leading to the development of a novel class of HIV medications. A study published in January 2011 found that delivering an siRNA molecule bound to an RNA aptamer molecule that specifically binds to the surface of HIV cells significantly reduced expression of the HIV virus in mice injected with the virus. &lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Challenges in Drug Delivery== 

The manufacture and marketing of RNAi drugs have been especially challenging due to difficulties in its drug delivery system; RNA is degraded in the human bloodstream, making it difficult for the drug to reach its intended site of action in human cells to be effective. &lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; To counter this problem, scientists are investigating ways to couple RNAi molecules with other molecules to prevent the premature breakdown of RNAi molecules in the bloodstream before reaching cells or package RNAi molecules inside enclosed molecules that can transport the RNAi molecules to ensure its effective delivery. For instance, UCSF researchers are exploring ways to package siRNAs inside fat-coated molecules known as liposomes as a means of drug delivery, which are already extensively used as drug vehicles in commercial drug development. &lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; Once transported to its intended site of action, the siRNA contents can be released out of the liposomes to silence genes at that site.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Ibuprofen== 

[[File:Ibuprofen2.svg|thumb|Ibuprofen2]]

Ibuprofen is often used as a NSAID. NSAID is an abbreviation for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. It is used to relief symptoms of arthritis or fever. Basically, Ibuprofen acts as an analgesic or pain reliever. It is typically found in many over-the-counter drugs, such as Motrin, Advil, Potrin, and Nuprin. In other words, it often comes in capsules, tablets, or powder form. Comparing to that of aspirin for example, Ibuprofen is somewhat short-lived and relatively mild. However, it is known to have an antiplatelet effect. Ibuprofen is also seen as the core medicine in the World Health Organization's (WHO) Model List of Essential Medicines. This is the list of minimum medical needs based on a particular healthcare system. 

In addition, ibuprofen acts as a vasoconstrictor because it inhibits the vasodilating prostacyclin that is produced by cyclooxygenase 2 enzymes. In the year 1969, Ibuprofen is known as a carboxylic acid that was first found in the United Kingdom by Boot Pure Drug Company in the name of Brufen. However, many people are familiar that it was discovered by Andrew RM Dunlop with the help of people such a John Nicholson and Stewart Adams. Even till this day, ibuprofen comes in different forms as pain reliever and is seen under a variety of popular trademarks (brand name medicines sold in over-the-counter drugs).

== Medical Uses ==
Typically, ibuprofen is used for sickness such as pain, fever, or even dysmenorrhea. It can also be used for rheumatoid arthritis, which is known as a type of inflammatory disease. 

Not only is ibuprofen in tablet or capsule forms, but they can also be in topical gel form that can simply absorb through the skin, which are commonly used during sport injuries because it does not cause a high risk of digestive problems. 

=== Dosage ===
Although, ibuprofen is known as its short half-life, it actually consist of a dose-dependent time period of around four to eight hours. This is quite a lot, especially with the kind of characteristic ibuprofen have. There is no specific dose a person should intake. In other words, the recommended dose varies from person to person base on the weight of their body and indication. Even with no specific dose, it is typically said that the maximum amount for over-the-counter use is approximately a dose of 400 mg per dose and 1200 mg per day. However, there is an exception for individuals who have stronger tolerance and response because the maximum that they can take is about 800 mg per dose and 3200 mg per day. 

=== Ibuprofen Lysine ===
Ibuprofen lysine is also known as ibuprofen lysinate. Interestingly, ibuprofen lysine is licensed for treatment of the same condition as ibuprofen in places such as Europe, New Zealand, and Australia. Since lysine salt is known to increase water solubility it is often used for closure of a patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants who are no more than 32 weeks gestational age that weigh between 500 and 1,500 grams. That is exactly one to three pounds. The drug will be ineffective if ibuprofen lysine is used in infants over the 32 week span. The use of Ibuprofen lysine is to support the respiratory and fluid restriction. Besides infants, ibuprofen can be used to help kidney function in people of all ages. Overall, comparing to that of acid ibuprofen, ibuprofen lysine shows to work faster which proves how effective it can be.

==Synthesis==
Ibuprofen was found by the Boot Pure Drug Company and the synthesis is named after the company as the &quot;Boot process&quot;. In the process it starts with Friedel-Crafts acylation of Isobutylbenzene.




[[File:Benzene Friedel-Crafts alkylation-diagram.svg|Benzene Friedel-Crafts alkylation-diagram|500px]]


&quot;The Boot Process''
# Isobutylbenzene reacted with Ethyl chloroacetate would result with α,β-epoxy ester
# Hydrolyzed 
# decarboxylated to the aldehyde
# React with hydroxylamine gave oxime 
# Converted to nitrile, 
# hydrolyzed to the desire acid

:[[File:Boots synthesis of ibuprofen.png|900px]]

Later on, the new Hoechst process named after the Hoechst Company undergoes a similar acetylation, followed by a hydrogenation with (Raney nickel) catalyst. It will result in alcohol and last reaction is palladium-catalyzed carbonylation.


:[[File:BHC synthesis of ibuprofen.png|900px]]



==Ibuprofen Mechanism-COX inhibitor==
[[File:Cyclooxygenase-1 with bound ibuprofen 1EQG.png|thumb|Cyclooxygenase-1 with bound ibuprofen 1EQG]]

[[File:6COX.png|thumb|6COX|6 COX-2]]
Ibuprofen's function is to block an enzymes called cyclooxygenase(COX). The NSAIDs unselectively inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2. When the COX is inhibited, arachidonic acid is converted into H2(PGH2),then PGH2 is converted into prostaglandins and tothromboxane A2. Prostaglandins could ease inflammation, fever and pain, and tothrombozne A2 could lead to formation of blood clots. Since the only function desired in this brought by COX-2 (easing pain, fever and inflammation) and COX-1 is causing unwanted side effects further researches have been done on blocking COX-2 but not COX-1. After years of research, through X-ray crystallography and biophysical techniques this selective blocking is achieved.

==Side Effects==
Ibuprofen can cause severe allergic reactions to certain people. If the following symptoms are present, seek medical help immediately:
* hives
* swelling in lips, face, throat or tongue
* difficulty breathing
* chest pain
* vision problems
* bloody vomit
* nausea
* fever
* jaundice (yellow skin or eyes)
* convulsions

Less severe symptoms can include:
* upset stomach
* diarrhea
* constipation
* itching
* dizziness
* ringing in ears

==incompatibility with other drugs==
Ibuprofen can cause violent reactions when mixed with some other drugs. This drugs include, but not limited to:
* antidepressant
* aspirin or other NSAIDS
* heart of blood pressure medicine
* lithium
* diuretics
* steroids
* methotrexate
* blood thinner

=Nexium=

==Description==
Esomeprazole, brand name known as Nexium, is categorized as a group of drugs called proton pump inhibitors. By inhibiting ATPase in gastric parietal cells, Esomeprazole decreases the amount of acid secretion in the stomach. This drug is mainly used for people with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a disease in which an excessive amount of gastric acid causes a backflow from the stomach and thus leading to the burning of the esophagus. By preventing the formation of gastric acid, Esomeprazole allows the injured esophagus to heal and prevent further damages. 

==Drug Structure== 
The molecular formula of Esomeprazole is (C17H18N3O3S)2Mg* 3 H2O, with molecular weight of 767.2g as a trihydrate and 713.1g on an anhydrous basis. 
 
==Side effects==
Studies have showed patients who receive high-dose of Esomprazole have increased risk of fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. High dose defines as multiple intakes every day for a long term period. In addition, Esomeprazole may cause serious side effects such as the following:
•blisters 
•hives
•rash
•itching
•difficulty breathing or swallowing
•irregular, fast, or pounding heartbeat
•uncontrollable shaking of a part of the body
•seizures
•stomach pain
•fever

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
Thalidomide was synthesized in 1953 by a West German company as a sedative. It became popular outside of the United States to help with morning sickness in the mid 1950s, but in 1961 it was discovered to cause birth defects. Its popular use was discontinued, but it is now used as a treatment for other diseases, such as leprosy and multiple myeloma. &lt;ref name= &quot;letter&quot;&gt;[http://thornlea.sharpschool.com/UserFiles/Servers/Server_119514/File/Library%20Classes%20Documents/Gr.%209%20Science/Pregnancy%20and%20Fetal%20Development/thalidomideandcongenitalabnormalities.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
===Composition===
Thalidomide is a tasteless and odorless white crystalline compound. &lt;ref name= &quot;comp&quot;&gt; [http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM196212062672305 The Saga of Thalidomide] &lt;/ref&gt;

The chemical formula of thalidomide is C13H10N2O4, and it exists as a racemic mixture. 

===Synthesis=== 
A two-step synthesis of thalidomide is presented in 2 scheme below 
requires no purifications. Reaction of L-glutamine with
N-carbethoxyphthalimide produces N-phthaloyl-L-glutamine.
Cyclization of N-phthaloyl-L-glutamine to produce thalidomide
is accomplished by treatment with CDI in the presence of a
catalytic amount of DMAP. &lt;ref name=&quot;A Concise Two-Step Synthesis of Thalidomide&quot;&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/op980201b A Concise Two-Step Synthesis of Thalidomide]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical Importance==
Despite the widespread tragedy associated with thalidomide, it continues to be used in medical settings due to its usefulness in the treatment of a number of conditions and diseases, such as leprosy and cancer.

The aspects of thalidomide most applicable to treatments such as those for leprosy and multiple myeloma are its inhibition of angiogenesis, and the anti-inflammatory effects. In leprosy, thalidomide is particularly effective in suppressing painful related conditions.

In a study of patients with advanced multiple myeloma, thalidomide was shown to cause remission in 10% of the patients. This could be due to a number of factors, including angiogenesis inhibition, the ability of thalidomide to alter adhesion molecule expression, and its inhibiting effect on the growth of the tumor necrosis factor alpha.  &lt;ref name= &quot;myeloma&quot;&gt;[http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejm199911183412102 Antitumor Activity of Thalidomide in Refractory Multiple Myeloma]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thalidomide selectively inhibits the tumor necrosis factor alpha by degrading its mRNA, decreasing the half life of this molecule. &lt;ref name = &quot;mRNA&quot;&gt;[http://jem.rupress.org/content/177/6/1675.full.pdf+html Moreira et. al.]&lt;/ref&gt; Inhibition of this factor, which causes fever and discomfort in cancer patients, can make quality of life much better. However, it may also weaken the immune system. &lt;ref name = &quot;TNF&quot;&gt;[http://jem.rupress.org/content/173/3/699.full.pdf+html Sampaio et. al]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thalidomide can also help with the wasting caused by HIV, because it inhibits tumor necrosis factor alpha.  &lt;ref name= &quot;Tox Sciences&quot;&gt;[http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/122/1/1.full Thalidomide: The Tragedy of Birth Defects and the Effective Treatment of Disease]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Teratogenic Effects==
Children whose mothers took thalidomide during pregnancy were often born with shortened or missing limbs.

The structure of thalidomide contributes to its teratogenic effects. Tests show that only the S enantiomer of thalidomide is teratogenic. Thalidomide was originally racemic, but cannot be made safe by isolating one enantiomer, as the R entantiomer will readily convert to the S enantiomer in the body. &lt;ref name = &quot;enant&quot;&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/op980201b A Concise Two-Step Synthesis of Thalidomide]&lt;/ref&gt;   
 
There have been various hypotheses regarding the mechanisms of thalidomide, particularly as it relates to teratogenicity. However, current research is mostly concerned with &quot;(1) oxidative stress/damage, (2) DNA intercalation, (3) inhibition of angiogenesis, and (4) cereblon (CRBN) binding.&quot; &lt;ref name= &quot;Tox Sciences&quot;&gt;[http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/122/1/1.full Thalidomide: The Tragedy of Birth Defects and the Effective Treatment of Disease]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

# Thalidomide has been shown to encourage production of oxygen radicals in rats to whom it has been administered, which results in oxidative stress as fewer viable oxygens are biologically available, effecting a large number of organs that rely on oxygen.
# Thalidomide attaches to promoter sites that are GC-rich using DNA intercalation, decreasing transcription of IGF-1 and FGF-2, which both lead to angiogenesis and the proper growth of extremities and limbs. 
# Thalidomide is an angiogenesis inhibitor, which means that it prevents the formation of new blood vessels. This is useful in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, and solid tumors &lt;ref name= &quot;angio&quot;&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/91/9/4082.full.pdf+html) Angiogenesis Inhibition]&lt;/ref&gt;
# CRBN has been found to be a thalidomide-binding protein, and its mutant form, which binds poorly to thalidomide, may weaken thalidomide's tetatogenic limb affects when it is overexpressed.
It is likely that these mechanisms all contribute to some way in thalidomide's overall teratogenic effect.

When pregnant rabbits (thalidomide sensitive) and pregnant rats (thalidomide insensitive), green fluorescent protein expression in the cells of the limb buds of the rabbit embryos was decreased, while that the in the rats was unaffected. &lt;ref name= &quot;Tox Sciences&quot;&gt;[http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/122/1/1.full Thalidomide: The Tragedy of Birth Defects and the Effective Treatment of Disease]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Exposure periods have been correlated to specific problems caused by thalidomide: http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/122/1/1/F3.large.jpg

===Drug Trials=== 
Thalidomide originally underwent animal testing as well as clinical trials in humans. This included 98 children under the age of 1, 160 nursing mothers, and 81 women in the third trimester of pregnancy. No teratogenic effects were observed during the clinical trials. &lt;ref name= &quot;comp&quot; /&gt;
Following the thousands of birth defects caused by thalidomide, it became mandatory to test drugs on pregnant animals, to detect teratogenic effects. &lt;ref name=&quot;letter&quot; /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Lysosome==
Lysosomes are spherical bodies, or vacuoles that are enclosed by a single membrane. The membrane serves as a protectorate to the cell, since lysosomes contain harsh digestive enzymes, which would cause significant damage if exposed to cell content. Lysosomes contain different hydrolytic enzymes, such as proteases, lipases, and nucleases that are capable of breaking down all types of biological polymers (e.g. proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids) that enter the cell or are no longer useful to the cell. In all, lysosomes function as the digestive system of the cell. On another note, lysosomes avoid self-digestion by glycosylation of inner membrane proteins, which prevent their degradation. [[File:Lysosome.jpg|thumb|Structure of Lysosome]]

Lysosomes are membrane-enclosed organelles that help eukaryotic cells obtain nourishment from macromolecular nutrients. The lysosomes contain many hydrolytic enzymes such as proteases, nucleases, and lipases). The lysosomes are formed vesicles containing hydrolytic enzymes and proton pumps bud off from the Golgi complex. Phagocytosis and lysosomal digestion help the eukaryotic cell because they effectively increase the membrane surface area over which nutrients can be absorbed. However, in eukaryotes, lysosomes allow for intracellular digestion, and digested material crosses the lysosomal membrane into the cytoplasm.

==Lysosome Production==
Lysosomes are manufactured and budded into the cytoplasm by the Golgi apparatus with enzymes inside. The enzymes that are within the lysosome are made in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, which are then delivered to the Golgi apparatus via transport vesicles. When lysosome reaches the cytoplasm, fusion forms a secondary lysosome.

==Inside Lysosomes==
Lysosomes contain enzymes that include:
* Glycosidase: an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of glycosidic linkages in sugar molecules.
* Protease: an enzyme that catalysis the hydrolysis of peptide bonds.
* Acid phosphatase: a phosphatase, an enzyme that catalyzes they hydrolysis of phosphate linkages in a variety of molecules.  
* Sulfatase: an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of sulfate ester linkages in molecules.
* Lipase: an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of ester bonds in lipid molecules.
* Amylase: an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of carbohydrates into sugars.
* Nuclease: an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds in nucleotide subunits of nucleic acids. 
*glucocerebrosidase: an enzyme which breaks down glucocerebroside
* Phosphoric Acid monoesters

Lysosome enzymes are proteins that are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and modified in the Golgi apparatus. Lysosomal enzymes are tagged for lysosomes by the addition of mannose-6-phopahte label. A shortage of any one of these enzymes will lead to lysosome diseases such as Tay-Sachs disease and Pompe’s disease. 

==Lysosomal Defects==
In human cells, when lysosomes lack enzymes they can generate storage disease. People with these defects are usually missing one or more of the Lysosomal hydrolysis enzymes. 
: '''Tay-Sachs Disease'''
: Tay-Sachs disease is a disease that affects the nervous system. It occurs when the body lacks hexosaminidase A, a protein that breaks down ganglioside. Accumulation of ganglioside
: '''Pompe’s disease'''
: Pompe’s disease is a disease that affects the heart and skeletal muscles. It occurs when the body lacks alpha-glucosidase, an enzyme that breaks down glycogen. 
: '''Mucopolysaccharidosis I'''
: MPS I is cause by the deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase. Deficiency can effect both skeletal and mental development. 
: '''Gaucher’s disease'''
: Gaucher’s disease is caused by the deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase enzyme. A deficiency of this enzyme causes harmful substances to build up in liver, spleen, bones, and bone marrow. 

==Lysosomal Enzyme Production==
Enzymes that are used by the lysosome are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are transported to the Golgi apparatus (GA). The ER formed transport vesicles that carry the enzymes and loads them by fusing them to the GA. Glycosylation may occur, which will determine the final destination of the proteins.
 
==Lysosome Acid-Hydrolyses== 
Lysosomes contain a variation of enzymes that hydrolyze proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. The enzymes present in the lysosomes work best at an acidic pH; thus they are referred to as acid hydrolases. Is it evident to note that the pH in a lysosome is about ~5 while the cytoplasm has a neutral pH of about ~7. In order for the lysosome to maintain an acidic pH, the lysosome must actively uptake concentrate H+ ions (protons). The concentrated H+ ions are actively equilibrated to reach a pH of about 5 by hydrogen ion pumps. In part with the pH level, enzymes within a lysosomes work best at an acidic pH.

==Function==
Lysosomes digest unused and/or threatening content that is present in the cell. In retrospect, lysosomes recycle the cell’s organic material in a process known as autophagy.  It also recycles waste products such as fats, carbohydrates, proteins, and other macromolecules into simple compounds, which are then utilized as new materials in the cytoplasm. The recycling of waste product is in large part due to about 40 different types of hydrolytic enzymes that are engineered by the endoplasmic reticulum and modified by the Golgi apparatus.  

:'''Autophagy (Autophagocytosis)''' 
:The term autophagy is derived from the Greek “auto” or oneself and “phagy” to eat. Autophagy is a process of self-eating and self-degradation. The degradation takes part when the cell content and organelles is consumed by lysosomes. The cell produces vesicles called autophagosomes that captures and deliver cytoplasmic material to lysosomes.  Autophagosomes are formed when the ER wraps around damaged cell structures or cell content, of which the lysosome then joining the autophagosomes to destroy the content captured and delivers the broken down material to the cytoplasm. Overall, autophagocytosis preserves the health of cells and tissues by degrading unused and/or damaged cellular content to new ones. 

:'''Endocytosis'''
:Endocytosis occurs when the cell membrane of a cell surrounds large nutritional molecules. This engulfing of a large nutritional molecule forms a endosome. Some of the things endosomes acquire are complex lipids, polysaccharides, nucleic acids, and proteins. Lysosomes then fuse with endosomes, whereby it transfers it enzymes to breakdown molecules. The broken down molecules are then delivered to the cytoplasm by proteins for later consumption. 

:'''Phagocytosis'''
:Lysosome works in close relations with phagocytosis whereby it joins phagosomes to break down the object or bacteria with its enzymes.  Phagosomes are produced when the cell membrane of a cell surrounds a disease-causing bacterium; toxic or unused content in/outside the cell.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==

The cytoskeleton provides support in a cell.  It is a network of protein fibers supporting cell shape and anchoring organelles within the cell.  The three main structural components of the cytoskeleton are microtubules  (formed by tubulins) , microfilaments (formed be actins) and intermediate filaments.  All three components interact with each other non-covalently. 
Eukaryotic cells contain proteins called intermediate filaments, microfilaments, and microtubules that are collectively termed the cytoskeleton. Also, the cytoskeleton proteins are multifunctional and are also involved in whole-cell movements and movements of substances within the cell. 

Actins and Tubulins are abundant cytoskeletal proteins which support diverse cellular processes due to their unique properties of filament-forming proteins. Recent evidences suggest that regulated degradation pathways exist for actin and tubulin collectively maintain the quality control of cytoskeletal proteins, ensuring the appropriate function of microfilaments and microtubules.&lt;ref&gt;Lundin , Victor , Michel Leroux, and Peter Stirling. &quot;Elsevier: Article Locator.&quot; ScienceDirect.com | Search through over 10 million science, health, medical journal full text articles and books.. sciencedirect.com, n.d. Web. 17 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000409002461#&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt;

====Microtubules====
Microtubules are polymers of tubulin.  They help with cell transport.  They also help with the cell shape because it resists compression.  It also helps facilitate cell motility.  There are two motor proteins that assist organelles to move along the microtubules:
*Kinesin, which moves things away from the nucleus.  
*Dynein, which moves things towards the nucleus.
Microtubles have a larger diameter than microfilaments and intermediate filaments. The hollow microtubule structure consists of 13 tubulin dimers. They are one alpha-tubulin protein plus one beta-tubulin protein form one tubulin dimer. Microtubules also help movement of substances within the cell and are also involved in powering whole-cell movement by cilia and flagella. The microtubules provide tracks that can move vesicles from one organelle to the next in an efficient, directed fashion. Microtubules also segregate the duplicated chromosomes during mitosis. 

====Microfilaments====
Microfilaments are polymers of actin.  They help with cell shape also because it bears tension in the cell.  It is also involved in cell motility.  There are three types of cell shape, which are microvilli, lamellipodia, and filopodia.
*Microvilli are projections on surface that increase surface area.
*Lamellipodia are membrane ruffles that help sense the environment and direct movement.
*Filopodia are like microvilli but are less stable.  They also sense the environment.  They can turn into lamellipodia.
Microfilaments are formed when individual actin monomers polymerize, in a process fueled by ATP hydrolysis, to form chains of filamentous actin. Microfilaments are dynamic structures, growing and shrinking in a controlled manner. Some microfilaments play a structrual role in the cell to maintain cell shape. These structural microfilaments have protein caps at both ends to prevent changes in microfilament length. Anyways, other microfilaments have functions that require dynamic changes in length. The microfilaments also mediate cytoplasmic streaming, a mixing of the cytoplasm that aids diffusion. 

====Intermediate filaments====
Intermediate filaments are polymers of keratin. They help with cell shape also because it bears tension in the cell.  It is primarily involved in organelle anchorage.
The intermediate filaments also consist of various fibrous proteins that have a diameter of about 10 nm. Intermediate filaments often form a meshwork under the cell membrane and, in cells that lack a cell wall, help impart and maintain cell shape. Intermediate filaments are fairly stable and are not thought to undergo acute changes in length the way microfilaments and microtubules do.

==Functions of Cytoskeleton==
Cytoskeletons are often synthesized based on the cell's needs; however, some protein fibers are permanent. The changeable nature of the cytoskeleton thus contributes to its five important functions.

===Cell Shape===
[[File:Microvilli.png|thumb|Microvilli]]
The mechanical strength of the cell is due to protein scaffolding in the cytoskeleton. In some cells, protein scaffolding also determines the shape of the cell. Microvilli are supported by cytoskeletal fibers such as microfilaments. Microvilli also increase the surface area of the cell for the absorption of materials. 

===Internal Organization===
The cytoskeletal fibers of the cell help stabilize positions of organelles. However, the interior arrangement of the cell varies based on the cell's needs. The organelles are dynamic and change minute to minute. 

===Intracellular Transport===
The cytoskeleton has the ability to move materials not only in the cell but also within the cytoplasm, thus aiding in the movement of organelles as well. This function is important especially in the nervous system where materials are often transported over long intracellular distances. 

===Assembly Of Cells Into Tissues===
Cells are connected to one another through the linking of the protein fibers of the cytoskeleton as well as the protein fibers in the extracellular space. In the process, materials outside the cell are stabilized as well. The assembly of cells not only contributes to the mechanical strength of the tissue but also allows information to transfer between cells from one to another. 

===Movement===
[[File:Motor Proteins.png|thumb|Motor Protein]]
The cytoskeleton of the cell allows the cell to move. For example, the cytoskeleton of white blood cells allows them to squeeze out of blood vessels. Growing nerve cells are also able to send out extensions that allow them to elongate. The microtubule cytoskeleton of cilia and flagella on the cell membrane allow them to move. In addition, motor proteins using energy from ATP can aid in the movement of cells and intracellular transport by sliding along cytoskeletal fibers. There are three types of motor proteins in the cytoskeleton that include myosins, kinesins and dyneins.Kinesins often times brings vesicles from inside the cell out to the periphery. If the kinesins are mutated, then there is likely to be a neural disorder. KIF1β is one disorder resulting from a mutated kinesin. It causes lack of strengths in arms and legs. Dynein, on the opposite hand, brings the vesicles from the periphery back to the inside of cell.  Motor proteins convert energy into movement and those found in the cytoskeleton use stored ATP. Myosins allow for muscle contractions. Kinesins allow for the movement along microtubules as dyneins help with the whiplike motion of the microtubule bundles of cilia and flagella. Many motor proteins consist of two heads (to bind to the cytoskeleton fiber), a neck and a tail region at the end to bind to organelles.

==&lt;big&gt;Quality control of cytoskeletal proteins&lt;/big&gt;==

===The evolution of cytoskeletal proteins===

The evolution of cytoskeletal proteins required a novel biogenesis machinery. The cytoskeleton in eukaryotes enhances intracellular trafficking and cell division. These functions were once believed to be the distinguish elements of eukaryotes from prokaryotes because bacterial cytoskeleton also composed of proteins that similar to actin and tubulin. The actin-like and tubulin-like proteins in bacteria form filamentous structures which imply in the division of genetic material and maintenance of cell shape.&lt;ref&gt;J. Pogliano  The bacterial cytoskeleton  Curr. Opin. Cell Biol., 20 (2008), pp. 19–27&lt;/ref&gt; However, actins and tubulins in eukaryotes are distinct from similar prokaryotic proteins in the way that they maintain inovative properties which is critical for eukaryogenesis (the origin of the eukaryotic condition/the evolution of the eukaryotic condition).&lt;ref&gt;M.R. Leroux, F.U. Hartl  Protein folding: versatility of the cytosolic chaperonin TRiC/CCT  Curr. Biol., 10 (2000), pp. R260–264&lt;/ref&gt;

Both eukaryotes and bacteria have a cytoskeleton. The bacterial proteins homologous to actin are MreB and ParM, and the bacterial proteins homologous to tubulin are FtsZ. However, actin and tublin differ from MreB, ParM, and FtsZ in the sense that they have properties important for eukaryogenesis. 
::Actins and tubulins in eukaryotes formed microfilaments and microtubules which unite with their complementary molecular motors (myocin, kinesin, dynein) to be used for phagocytosis. Phagocytosis enables endosymbiosis and also cilia's development  which supports mobility and sensory.&lt;ref&gt;T. Cavalier-Smith  The phagotrophic origin of eukaryotes and phylogenetic classification of Protozoa  Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol., 52 (2002), pp. 297–354&lt;/ref&gt; The inception of actins and tubulins in eukaryotes is an important factor in facilitating their efficient folding and assembly &lt;ref&gt;S. Bertrand et al.  Folding, stability and polymerization properties of FtsZ chimeras with inserted tubulin loops involved in the interaction with the cytosolic chaperonin CCT and in microtubule formation  J. Mol. Biol., 346 (2005), pp. 319–330&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Bertrand et al.  Folding, stability and polymerization properties of FtsZ chimeras with inserted tubulin loops involved in the interaction with the cytosolic chaperonin CCT and in microtubule formation  J. Mol. Biol., 346 (2005), pp. 319–330&lt;/ref&gt; which is called cytoskeletal protein biogenesis machinery (CPBM). The CPBM includes molecular chaperones which assist folding of chaperonin containing tailless complex polypeptide-1 (CCT), prefoldin (PFD) - phosducin-like proteins that regulate CCT functions, and five other cofactors. &lt;ref&gt;S. Lacefield, F. Solomon  A novel step in beta-tubulin folding is important for heterodimer formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.C. Stirling et al.  PhLP3 modulates CCT-mediated actin and tubulin folding via ternary complexes with substrates&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.C. Stirling et al.  Functional interaction between phosducin-like protein 2 and cytosolic chaperonin is essential for cytoskeletal protein function and cell cycle progression&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E.A. Mccormack et al.  Yeast phosducin-like protein 2 acts as a stimulatory co-factor for the folding of actin by the chaperonin CCT via a ternary complex&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Lopez-Fanarraga et al.  Review: postchaperonin tubulin folding cofactors and their role in microtubule dynamics  J. Struct. Biol., 135 (2001), pp. 219–229&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, post-translational modifications and proteasomal degradation are required in regulating the function of actins and tubulins which is also unique to eukaryotes.

::On the other hand, in prokaryotes, the cytoskeletal protein biogenesis machinery is absent.

===Autoregulation of cytoskeletal protein synthesis===
Actin and tubulin concentrations are strickly controlled due to their critical effects on cytoskeletal dynamics. In animal cells, tubulin synthesis is regulated by an autoregulatory feedback mechanism that can sense the concentration of tubulin heterodimer in order to regulate the stability of ɑ-tubulin, and β-tubulin mRNAs. &lt;ref&gt;D.W. Cleveland et al.  Unpolymerized tubulin modulates the level of tubulin mRNAs  Cell, 25 (1981), pp. 537–546&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.E. Sellin et al.  Global regulation of the interphase microtubule system by abundantly expressed Op18/stathmin  Mol. Biol. Cell, 19 (2008), pp. 2897–2906&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to animals, the synthesis of tubulin in metazoans is also autoregulated due to its critical influences. Researches have shown that  overexpression of β-tubulin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae leads to abnormal microtuble function and slow growth.&lt;ref&gt;D. Burke et al.  Dominant effects of tubulin overexpression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  Mol. Cell. Biol., 9 (1989), pp. 1049–1059&lt;/ref&gt;

Actin overexpression causes by an incompletely characterized feedback mechanism that is sensitive to the concentration of actin monomers is preventable by the presence of the 3' untranslated region of actin mRNA.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lyubimova et al.  Autoregulation of actin synthesis requires the 3′-UTR of actin mRNA and protects cells from actin overproduction  J. Cell Biochem., 76 (1999), pp. 1–12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biogenesis of cytoskeletal proteins===

The cytoskeleton protein biogenesis machinery is found in eukaryotes but not in prokaryotes. It includes chaperonin containing CCT (complex polypeptide-1) and PFD (prefoldin), phosductin-like proteins, and five cofactors. The chaperonin molecules help actin and tubulin proteins to fold. Challenges to the protein biogenesis machinery include: (1) the high concentrations of actin and tubulin in cells, (2) the tendency of actin and tubulin to self-associate, (3) the inability of actin and tubulin to fold without the help of other molecules, (4) the fact that actin and tubulin compete with one another for the same folding space. 

Biogenesis of cytoskeletal proteins faces a lot of difficulty which mainly due to the abundant of actin and tubulin concentrations, self-associate tendency, and the inability in folding independently. In addition, the competing for access to limited folding space is also a challenge to biogenesis of cytoskeletal proteins.&lt;ref&gt;M.R. Leroux, F.U. Hartl  Protein folding: versatility of the cytosolic chaperonin TRiC/CCT  Curr. Biol., 10 (2000), pp. R260–264&lt;/ref&gt;  Fortunately, the action of specific chaperonin cofactors can account for the regulation of chaperonin-mediated cytoskeletal protein folding.

====Eukaryotic cytosolic chaperonin====
Eukaryotic cytosolic chaperonin is a unique ability to assist the folding of actin and tubulin. Molecular chaperones can interact with the newly synthesized polypeptide chains to become stable during the folding process form a linear monomer amino acids chain into a more complex and functional protein &lt;ref&gt;F.U. Hartl, M. Hayer-Hartl  Converging concepts of protein folding in vitro and in vivo  Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol., 16 (2009), pp. 574–581&lt;/ref&gt;. There are many types of chaperones that direct the folding of new proteins, refolding of stress-denatured proteins, unfolding of proteins, and transporting proteins &lt;ref&gt;F.U. Hartl, M. Hayer-Hartl  Converging concepts of protein folding in vitro and in vivo  Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol., 16 (2009), pp. 574–581&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E.T. Powers et al.  Biological and chemical approaches to diseases of proteostasis deficiency  Annu. Rev. Biochem., 78 (2009), pp. 959–991&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Chaperonin, an important family of molecular chaperones, has a barrel-like structure with two multimeric stacked rings of 60kDa (Dalton's atomic mass unit). Chaperonins undergo ATP-dependent conformational changes during its folding cycle: facilitate substrate binding, encapsulation and release&lt;ref&gt;C.R. Booth et al.  Mechanism of lid closure in the eukaryotic chaperonin TRiC/CCT  Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol., 15 (2008), pp. 746–753&lt;/ref&gt;. In eukaryotes, the cytosolic chaperonin is the tailless complex polypeptide 1 ring complex (CCT) which is required for viability in yeast and worms. 

CCT is crucial for the biogenesis of actin and tubulin. CCT is composed of eight related subunits - ɑ,β,ɣ,ẟ,ɛ,ʝ,ŋ,θ - which show up twice in each oligomer. CCT is closely related to archaeal chaperonin thermosome but quite different from bacterial chaperonin GroEL &lt;ref&gt;C. Spiess et al.  Mechanism of the eukaryotic chaperonin: protein folding in the chamber of secrets  Trends Cell Biol., 14 (2004), pp. 598–604&lt;/ref&gt;. CCT is known to have a more specific binding profile than bacterial GroEL &lt;ref&gt;C. Dekker et al.  The interaction network of the chaperonin CCT  EMBO J., 27 (2008), pp. 1827–1839&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.Y. Yam et al.  Defining the TRiC/CCT interactome links chaperonin function to stabilization of newly made proteins with complex topologies  Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol., 15 (2008), pp. 1255–1262&lt;/ref&gt;. As a chaperonin, CCT undergoes ATP-dependent conformational changes during its folding cycle. Due on the copiousness of actin and tubulin, they occupy significant proportion of CCT complexes. Beside actin and tubulin, there are other CCT substrates also have key roles in progression of the cell cycle &lt;ref&gt;C. Spiess et al.  Mechanism of the eukaryotic chaperonin: protein folding in the chamber of secrets  Trends Cell Biol., 14 (2004), pp. 598–604&lt;/ref&gt; Researches show that CCT function in vivo is regulated by several dedicated cofactors, including PFD and phosducin-like proteins.

PFD, a jellyfish-shaped molecular chaperone required for stabilization of new cytoskeletal proteins, is a CCT co-chaperone for the biogenesis of actin and tubulin &lt;ref&gt;S. Geissler et al.  A novel protein complex promoting formation of functional alpha- and gamma-tubulin  EMBO J., 17 (1998), pp. 952–966&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Martín-Benito et al.  Structure of eukaryotic prefoldin and of its complexes with unfolded actin and the cytosolic chaperonin CCT  EMBO J., 21 (2002), pp. 6377–6386&lt;/ref&gt;.

Phosducin-like proteins, regulators of the folding of actin and tubulin in association with CCT, are thioredoxin domain-containing proteins with homology to phosducin, a regulator of retinal G-protein signaling &lt;ref&gt;M.

====Tubulin folding cofactors====

Scientists believed that actin is released from CCT in a native, assembly-competent state, but cyclase associated protein might interact with and stabilize near-native or unstable forms of actin in close association with the chaperonin &lt;ref&gt;E.A. McCormack et al.  Mutational screen identifies critical amino acid residues of beta-actin mediating interaction between its folding intermediates and eukaryotic cytosolic chaperonin CCT  J. Struct. Biol., 135 (2001), pp. 185–197&lt;/ref&gt;. On the other hand, functional tubulin is an obligate ɑ-β heterodimer, and evolved in a folding pathway linked to dimer assembly&lt;ref&gt;M. Lopez-Fanarraga et al.  Review: postchaperonin tubulin folding cofactors and their role in microtubule dynamics  J. Struct. Biol., 135 (2001), pp. 219–229&lt;/ref&gt;.

Roles of each cofactor: &lt;br /&gt;
1. Tubulin cofactor A (TBCA): collects unassembled beta-tubulin &lt;br /&gt;
2. Tubulin cofactor D (TBCD): assists beta-tubulin down the assembly pathway &lt;br /&gt;
3. Tubulin cofactor B (TBCB): binds to alpha-tubulin after chaperonin release &lt;br /&gt;
4. Tubulin cofactor E (TBCE): receives alpha-tubulin from TBCB and processes it further &lt;br /&gt;
5. Tubulin cofactor C (TBCC): promotes GTP hydrolysis in beta-tubulin if in the presence of a stable supercomplex (formed by the joining of beta-tubulin-TBCD and alpha-tubulin-TBCE complexes) &lt;br /&gt;
:a. also facilitates the release of native alpha-beta-tubulin heterodimer

Diseases linked to the cofactors:&lt;br /&gt;
It is believed that if TBCB is not degraded properly, a neurological disease called giant axonal neuropathy may result. This disease is related to decreased density of the microtubule of cells. Mutations of TBCE are associated with hypoparathyroidism (a developmental disorder), mental retardation, and facial dysmorphism (HRD).

===PFD===
Prefoldin (PFD) is a CCT co-chaperone required for stabilizing nascent cytoskeletal proteins. It consists of two alpha-type and four beta-type subunits which collectively make its structure resemble the shape of a jellyfish. The six subunits form a cavity shaped like a rectangle that attaches to newly formed actin and tubulin as the chains leave the ribosome. PFD then delivers the actin and tubulin to CCT, probably via a docking and substrate-release mechanism (supported by electron microscopy analysis of PFD-actin complexes). It is also possible that PFD improves the efficiency of actin and tubulin protein folding by navigating partially folded molecules back towards the CCT for more folding. This idea is supported by the fact that yeast cells without PFD were observed to fold actin and tubulin more slowly than wild-type cells. Furthermore, Pfd1 knockout mice showed signs of dysfunction of cytoskeletal proteins, neuronal loss, neuromuscular defects, and defective development of lymphocytes. These Pfd1 knockout mice were only viable for five weeks.  


===Phosducin-like proteins===
Phosducin-like proteins regulate the folding of actin and tubulin. Three such proteins have been termed PhLP1, PhLP2, and PhLP3 as they are CCT-binding proteins. PhLP1 assists in assembling heterotrimeric G-proteins by CCT; this process is regulated by PhLP1 phosphorylation. PhLP2 and PhLP3 are involved in the biogenesis of cytoskeletal proteins. It is believed that there is a specificity of PhLP2 for actin biogenesis and of PhLP3 for tubulin biogenesis. In other words, disruption of PhLP2 function caused severe actin cytoskeletal defects whereas disruption of PhLP3 function alters normal tubulin biogenesis. 

When studied in vitro, it is observed that an excess of PhLP2 and PhLP3 prevents actin and tubulin from being folded via the CCT-mediated folding pathway. It is believed that this is due to the reduced activity of CCT ATPase. However, when the study in done on yeast cells, it appears that PhLP2 stimulates actin folding by purified yeast CCT. The researchers of this study concluded that amino acids of mammalian PhPL2 that were not present in yeast PhLP2 are responsible for preventing actin and tubulin from being folded. This also supports the idea that higher eukaryotes evolved with more regulation of cytoskeletal proteins.

===Protein biogenesis/quality control pathways===

1. Translation
:a. Following translation, nascent actin and tubulin undergo folding via:
::i. PFD folding pathway.
:::1. Assisted by PFD and substrate delivery.
::ii. PFD-independent pathway.
2. Folding
:a. Both PFD and PFD-independent folding pathways lead to formation of CCT (cytosolic chaperonin).
:b. CCT-mediated folding follows, leading to: 
::i. Formation of near-native alpha- and beta-tubulin.
::ii. Formation of near-native actin.
3. Assembly, Disassembly, and Polymerization
:a. Near-native alpha- and beta-tubulin assembles into a TBCE-TBCD complex.
::i. Complex forms folded tubulin heterodimer.
::ii. Folded tubulin heterodimer polymerizes into a microtubule. 
:b. Near-native actin is folded into a folded actin monomer.
::i. Folded actin monomer polymerizes into a microfilament.
4. Degradation
:a. Free tubulin and free actin not used in polymerization undergo ubiquitylation  into proteasome.
::i. Proteasome is then degraded.

===Post-translational modification (PMT) of cytoskeletal proteins===
For actin, post-translational modification is known to affect only folding. Tubulin, on the other hand, is affected by PTM in such a way that allows native proteins to turn on and off activity in a reversible and regulatory manner. Tubulin can be modified in a number of ways such as acetylation, detyrosination, and glutamylation. These tubulin modifications occur on microtubules, and it has been hypothesized (though not well-tested) that the free tubulin heterodimer is the substrate responsible for reversing the modifications. Much study, however, has been dedicated to Tubulin PTMs in general. Tubulin acetylation, for example, has been shown in recent studies to be linked to a human neurodegenerative disease called amytrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

===Degradation of cytoskeletal proteins===
Part of the quality control process includes the degradation of proteins. Damaged proteins and misfolded proteins that cannot be refolded with the help of chaperones are removed in this process. Unfortunately, the pathway in which the degradation occurs is not as well studied as the biogenesis process.&lt;ref name=“Quality Control of Cytoskeletal Proteins and Human Disease”&gt;Lundin, Victor, Loroux, Michel and Stirling, Peter. “Quality Control of Cytoskeletal Proteins and Human Disease” January 2010: 288-295. Retrieved on 20 November 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;


Turn-over rates and steady-state concentrations of all cellular proteins is regulated in the following ways:

1. protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) 

2. lysosomal degradation
3. another proteolytic mechanism 

“Proteostasis” is the regulatory process in which damaged or incorrectly folded proteins that cannot be repaired by charperones are removed by proteolysis. Not much work has been put into the study of actin and tubulin degradation, but tubulin has been known to rapidly degrade in the presence of microtubule-destabilizing drugs such as colcemid. Such drugs make tubulin more soluble.


===Parkin===
Parkin is a ubiquitin-protein ligase important to tubulin degradation. Parkin is mutated in patients with autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinson disease (PD). Its normal function is to interact with HSP70-interacting protein (CHIP) to make stress-denatured proteins undergo ubiquitylation. Parkin is also believed to stimulate ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin. Cells that over-express mutant alpha-synuclein, a toxic inclusion-forming protein in Parkinson disease, reveal increased concentrations of alpha-tubulin and insoluble parkin. These two traits are also observed in patients affected by Lewy body disease.

===Cofactor E-like===
E-like (COEL), a tubulin folding cofactor, is a protein that destabilizes tubulin. Cells without human COEL contain excess amount of stable microtubules while microtubule disassembly and the degradation of α-tubulin is observed in cells with excess COELs. The degradation of tubulin caused by the presence of COEL is countered by a negative regulator of microtubule called stathmin that isolates tubulins. Overall, COEL is important for three reasons: 1. it can remove misfolded tubulin 2. regulate the concentration of tubulin 3. control tubulin isotype.&lt;ref&gt; Lundin, Victor, Loroux, Michel and Stirling, Peter. “Quality Control of Cytoskeletal Proteins and Human Disease” January 2010: 288-295.Retrieved on 20 November 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Actin Degradation===
In metazoan cells, the concentration of tubulin is reduced when CCT or PFD does not function properly. The concentration of actin, however, is not affected significantly. This suggests that the quality control for actin differs from that of tubulin. Relative to the control tubulins, there seems to be less of a need to remove misfolded β-actins. Still, there are incidences when actin degradation is necessary. In the case of ischemic oxidative damage, α-actin specific to the heart is degraded by proteasome. It is also found that α-actins are degraded by lysosomes when muscle contraction in cardiomyocytes is inhibited by the use of drugs. It has been recently observed that TRIM32, an ubiquitin that ubiquitylates α-actin in vitro, when unusually expressed in the human embryonic kidney cells, reduces the concentration of cytoplasmic β-actins. TRIM32 mutations have been found in Bardet-Biedl syndrome and muscular dystrophy, although the actual role TRIM32 plays in these diseases remains unknown.&lt;ref&gt; Lundin, Victor, Loroux, Michel and Stirling, Peter. “Quality Control of Cytoskeletal Proteins and Human Disease” January 2010: 288-295.Retrieved on 20 November 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
As knowledge on the diverse functions of RNA become more and more abundant, it has become quite apparent that understanding how RNA folds and what causes it to fold is going to be key to understanding RNA itself. Since its inception as an area of study, the RNA folding problem has been compared and contrasted with the much more difficult protein folding problem and many different methods of unfolding RNA have been considered and used. 

==How is it done?==
Originally, atomic force microscopy was considered as a method of unfolding RNA in physiological conditions of temperature and solvent in order to skip the usage of high temperatures and denaturants. Since then, the preferred method to unfold single molecules of RNA has evolved to the usage of laser tweezers, better known as optical tweezers, in order to apply force to the molecule to induce unfolding. This technique, called [[Structural Biochemistry/Mechanical Unfolding of RNA|mechanical unfolding]] allows direct observation of the unfolding and refolding of the RNA sequence being studied.

As an RNA molecule unfolds from more complex tertiary structures down to single strands, force and end-to-end distance is measured. Using this information, scientists can find the amount of work that is needed to unfold the RNA and the amount of work obtained upon refolding. The work obtained while refolding is known as the Gibbs free energy change. Further study of the time dependence of the processes help scientists determine kinetics that are involved. 

This unfolding of RNA is also present naturally in biological cells. [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA/RNA Helicase|Helicases]] unwind specific types of RNA and certain enzymes, such as RNA polymerases and ribosomes, need to unwind RNA strands before they can go about performing their assigned functions. In this case, those functions are transcription and translation of the RNA strand.

==Comparing and Contrasting with Protein Folding Problem==
Protein folding involves a combination of twenty amino acids in order to form a protein molecule. Also, because of its tendency to fall into different secondary structure arrangements (α-helices, parallel and anti-parallel β-sheets, β-turns, random coils, etc.) and for these secondary arrangements to share energy dependencies with its tertiary arrangements, the problem of protein folding is a formidable one. 

By comparison, the RNA folding is much simpler than protein folding. Only four nucleotides are used in building the structure with each nucleotide being composed of a base, a ribose, and a phosphate. The bases themselves differ only slightly from each other because of their similarities in form and differences only in carbonyl and amino group placements. The riboses are fundamentally the same other than their two possible conformations. The phosphate's electrostatic charge, though originally seen as an obstacle, can actually be controlled through the ionic strength of the solvent. There are only four main secondary structures for RNA (helices, loops, bulges, and junctions) and since the energies for the formation of these secondary structures is actually higher than those of RNA's tertiary structures, RNA can remain stable in its secondary structure.

==RNA folding software==
Unlike protein folding, RNA folding is feasibly modeled with mid-range computer processing power due to the significant drop in force-introducing molecules (4 nucleotide bases compared to 20 amino acids). Modelling of the minute forces contributed by RNA bases was demonstrated by the Stanford group [http://simbios.stanford.edu/ Simbios] which is dedicated to physics modelling of biological activity. The RNA folding program adds one nucleotide at a time to the RNA which prevents the computer from becoming overloaded. Because RNA structures form relatively stable and orderly shapes, this modelling provides a realistic simulation for real-world structure. The program and source code can be found [https://simtk.org/home/nast here].

The RNA folding process can be demonstrated in a game-like fashion as seen in the Carnegie Mellon and Stanford University program [http://eterna.cmu.edu/web/ EteRNA]. EteRNA creates a painless introduction to key forces present in RNA folding. Players can even create RNA molecules to meet certain requirements such as shape, length, and composition, desired for experimentation. If successful, the created RNA strand will be synthesized and used for testing. This sort of free-form program allows for human creativity to locate a solution to a problem where a computer's rigid method of thought would take painstaking hours to find.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Basics of Pharmacology==
Understanding how the science of pharmacology works will help us understand questions like, &quot;How come a person's stomach burns after taking an aspirin tablet?&quot; Or even perhaps why some grapefruit juice can increase the blood levels of some medicines in people. Pharmacology deals with how medicine and their chemicals affect the body's reactions to them. Pharmacology is immensely important for treating diseases and how medicine affects the organs of the body. Pharmacology can allow one to examine how drugs in the organs of the human body affect them and how they stay in it. In addition, pharmacology deals with how medicines interact with cells and genes, which affects the function of the cells and the body.

==Drugs in Pharmacology==
When medicines reach the reacting spots in the body, many events and things occurs along the way when it reaches that spot. There are four basic stages of the life of medicine in the body. It is known as adsorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. This entire process is known as ADME.

Absorption describes how when medicines enter the body they are are adsorbed into the bloodstream from their administration point. There are a few ways to enter medicine in the body. One way is orally like swallowing a pill and another is intramuscular, meaning having a needle injected into your body. Another example is entering subcutaneously like injecting insulin right below the skin. One more example is transdermal like wearing a skin patch. A main obstacle a drug faces when entering the body is the absorption stage. Medicines that are ingested by the mouth are taken through a special blood vessel coming from the digestive tract to the liver, where significant amounts can be killed by metabolic enzymes known as the &quot;first pass effect&quot; Alternatives paths of entering drugs to the body go through he liver, which will go into the bloodstream directly or through the skin or lungs. 

After the drug is absorbed the next step is known as distribution. This is when the bloodstream transports the medicine throughout the body. When this occurs, potential adverse reactions or side effects can happen when the drug interacts and affects another organ besides the organ that is originally targeted at. For example, a pain reliever used for the purpose of calming down a sore leg may result in irritating the stomach. This is a potential side effect. There are different factors that can affect the stage of distribution like if protein or fat molecules are in the blood. This is important because the protein and fat molecules can latch onto the drug molecules and essentially stop the progress of the drug. Drugs that are aimed at affecting the central nervous system like the brain and spinal cord have huge obstacle. The immense obstacle for the medicine molecules is almost impossible to penetrate and the drug enters a barricade known as the blood-brain barrier. This barrier is designed from an extremely compact and tight woven mesh of capillaries packed together as a defence wall against harmful and deadly substances like poisons or viruses. However, pharmacology has developed ways to bypass this barrier.

The next step after distribution is metabolization. This is when the drug is broken down and it takes two steps most of the time. These steps occur mainly in the body's chemical processing plant known as the liver. The liver has many chaotic events and activity going on but it is very controlled activity. The things that are taken into the bloodstream regardless of how it was taken in in the first place, is transported to the this large internal organ. This is where the chemicals are rearranged to form new structures used for the body. This is known as biotransformations.

These biotransformations occur in the liver are done by the enzymes. For each of our cells, we have various enzymes, taken from hundreds of thousands. Each enzyme is designed specifically for a certain function. Some of these enzymes break down molecules. Others can connect smaller molecules to form longer chains. Drugs most of the time  make it easier to get rid of the substance in urine. A majority of the products of the enzymes that break down are called metabolites, which are not as chemically active as the original molecule. This is how scientists refer to the liver as a detoxifying organ. Once in a while drug metabolites can have chemical activities of their own, which can be as potent as the original drug. When doctors prescribe these drugs, it is important to factor in these effects. After the liver enzymes are completed on the medicine, the now inactive drug goes trough the final stage of the body known as excretion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We are moving from Standing Purification to Micropurification, which is 100th of the volume of standard, and there are many reasons that scientists are shifting toward the micropurification.
A major reason is biochemists are seeking to ultimately work on cancer cells. However, They are expecting that Cancer cells that are provided will be small. Therefore, it has been crucial to modify the existing purification  (standing purification) to Micropurification, which is 100th in volume. 

	Another reason is that biochemists are going to find a suitable capacity of DEAE Sephacel beets to the volume of proteins, meaning they are going to saturate the beets with proteins to find the maximum capacity. 		

Background information 

Standard purification of protein is considered kind old school of biochemistry techniques in which proteins are separated based on their properties such size charge solubility functional groups and etc.  In sanding purification, biochemistry usually start with source of protein and by using different combined techniques of separations, they were able to discriminate between proteins based on their properties such centrifugation and electrophoresis.  
In Micropurification, It is similar to standard purification but biochemists modified the scale of the stands purification. For example, in DEAE instead of using 50-60 ml of DEAE-Sephacel Ion-exchange column, biochemists could use .1 ml. generally speaking  most of the  scale of the techniques employed  in Micropurification is miniaturized.

Methods and Materials 

	 Researchers used micropurification technique in variety of proteins however; we will focus more in the micropurification of Phosphofructokinase-1 which is a protein that regulates the glycolysis process. 
In the first step, usually is to obtain the protein from a source, in this case the source was rabbit muscle tissue. Then, the muscle tissue is being blended and homogenized. However, in order to keep the proteins from decomposition, biochemists usually use chemicals that acts as a protease inhibitor to protect the proteins from being decomposed upon homogenization. The homogenate is then balance. 


	

	The centrifugation step follows the homogenate step. In this step, biochemists usually separate the supernatant and the precipitate by density. PFK-1 is a soluble protein so we expect it to be in the supernatant. Therefore, we can just discard the supernatant. At this point, this we have many stuff in the supernatant fluid besides our protein. 


Just like standard purification, the next step will be what is called the heat step. Heat de-naturation is performed when the solid material is re-suspended. The purpose of this step is to denature all the proteins that are in the solution and not our protein of interest. This could be done by using a solution that contains the substrates MgSO4 and ATP that acts to stabilize rPFK-1 protecting it from denaturation. Then, we separate the supernatant and the bullets and we expect our protein to be in the supernatant. 
	
	Affinity chromatography technique is employed to separate proteins according to their charge.  After the heat-step, the 1cc micro-purification columns are set up according to standard purification procedures using 1/10 the volume of DEAE (ion-exchange) beads to separate the enzymes. Since our protein is positive charged and the beads are negative charged, our protein adheres to the beads. After that, addition of a successful portions of weak base is used to with different concentrations. Finally our protein is obtained with multiple fractions.

Finally, Lastly, if for any reason the purification could not be completed in one day, an additional step of salting-out is required to precipitate the enzyme. A G-25 Sephadex desalt column composed of beads that separate the enzyme from the NH4SO4 by size. Ideally, the first few fractions collected are expected to contain the greatest amount of PF

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:15px; margin-right:10px;&quot;&gt;This style guide is an introductory wikibook for beginners who want to produce political messages in various media formats. It is not a rule book; rather, it is a set of guidelines to facilitate effective political communication. Its purpose is to bridge the gap between two distinct styles to create pragmatic, clear, and useful information to establish a consistent tone, style, and format between all of the messages you or your organization produces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is meant as a practical guide for anyone, regardless of political affiliation, and it is organized in such a way that a person new to political communication can learn to create convincing and thought-provoking op-eds, letters to the editor, press releases, social media posts, website content, and spoken messages.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This template contains internal functionality for template {{nowrap|{{tl|subject page}}}}.  Interface logic, such as default values and support for {{nowrap|[[Template:Allbooks category|allbooks categories]]}}, is located at {{nowrap|{{tl|subject page}}}}.
=== Usage ===
All the parameters of {{tl|subject page}} are expected to be provided, even if blank; at this writing, the ones that could be blank are &lt;code&gt;parent2&lt;/code&gt;, {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;show all featured&lt;/code&gt;}}, {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;show all staged&lt;/code&gt;}}, and &lt;code&gt;maxcount&lt;/code&gt;.  There is also one additional parameter generated within the interface at {{nowrap|{{tl|subject page}}}}.
* {{((}}{allbooks page}{{))}} &amp;mdash; the name of the associated [[Template:allbooks category|allbooks category]] if it exists, otherwise blank.
Also, the following two parameters work differently here than at {{nowrap|{{tl|subject page}}}}.
* {{((}}{show all featured}{{))}} &amp;mdash; blank means don't use the allbooks category; there is no specially distinguished value &lt;tt&gt;no&lt;/tt&gt;.
* {{((}}{show all staged}{{))}} &amp;mdash; blank means don't use the allbooks category; there is no specially distinguished value &lt;tt&gt;no&lt;/tt&gt;.
=== See also ===
* {{tl|Subject page/booklist}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Too little for a chapter==
I propose that this chapter is removed. Or it is repurposed to list and explain the supplied examples in the distro.

==non working example==
&lt;s&gt;I don't think that this example is working correctly.  While the theory is good, the model that is generated does not look like a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodecahedron dodecahedron].  The problem appears to be that the initial cube is too small, as compared with the later intersecting cubes.&lt;/s&gt;

Identified the problem in the example, fixed it, and updated the rendered image.

==query idiom ==
I think the code has a few issues from the point of good design:
- the module embeds a scaling operation which is better left out and done outside the module - this removes the need for a parameter but its not a parameterisable shape
- both numbers are mysterious - at least the 116.565  should be named as the dihedral angle, and the 72 number better replaced by 360/5
- I'd prefer to factor out the box object as a module so its clearer that it is the same object being placed 6 times.

{{hide in print|1={{drop|T}}}}{{Only in print|T}}here are generally two ways to address political communication: as it should be and as it is.

One side of this argument often comprises writers and intellectuals. Frustrated with those who manipulate language for personal and political gain, they often complain about the nebulous language and misleading strategies of those who represent them. Among those in this group are writers like George Orwell, who bemoaned the purposeful misuse of language to manipulate and confuse rather than inform.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elements of Political Communication/References#CITEREFOrwell1946|Orwell, &quot;Politics and the English Language&quot;]].&lt;/ref&gt;  These complaints are nothing new; in Petronius' ''Satyricon'', written in the late first century AD, the narrator expresses the views of the writer:
[[File:SatyriconPithou1587.jpg|thumb|upright=.5|&lt;small&gt;1587 Copy of ''The Satyricon'' by Petronius&lt;/small&gt;]]
{{quote|Our rhetoricians tormented by another species of Furies when they cry, &quot;I received these wounds while fighting for the public liberty; I lost this eye in your defense: give me a guide who will lead me to my children, my limbs are hamstrung and will not hold me up!&quot; Even these heroics could be endured if they made easier the road to eloquence; but as it is, their sole gain from this ferment of matter and empty discord of words is, that when they step into the Forum, they think they have been carried into another world [.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.] every word a honied drop, every period sprinkled with poppy-seed and sesame.  Those who are brought up on such a diet can no more attain to wisdom than a kitchen scullion can attain to a keen sense of smell or avoid stinking of the grease. [.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.] With your well modulated and empty tones you have so labored for rhetorical effect that the body of your speech has lost its vigor and died.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elements of Political Communication/References#CITEREFArbiterNodotMarchenaDe Salas1922|Arbiter, ''Satyricon'']], 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the other side are the pragmatists, who place more emphasis on the ability to convince than to clarify. Political strategists like Niccolò Machiavelli, Saul Alinsky, and Frank Luntz, though they each express very different views, fall into this category. The methods of this second group have dominated the modern political marketplace, but they did not originate from a contemporary source either. Quintis Tullus Cicero, in his ''Commentariolum petitionis'', wrote:
{{quote|I have heard a man say about certain orators, to whom he had offered his case, &quot;that he had been better pleased with the words of the one who declined, than of the one who accepted.&quot; So true it is that men are more taken by look and words than by actual services.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elements of Political Communication/References#CITEREFCicero1899|Q. T. Cicero to M. T. Cicero, ''Commentariolum petitionis'']].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Though this is clearly an oversimplification of the conflict, both perspectives offer important insight. Neither purely clear and concise nor clever and careful political messaging is enough to appease the average voter, regardless of his or her ideology. {{hide in print|1=This guide is an attempt to bridge the gap between these two schools of thought.}}
{{only in print|1===Purpose==
This book is for beginners who want to produce political messages in various media formats. It is not a rule book; rather, it is a set of guidelines to facilitate effective political communication. Its purpose is to bridge the gap between two distinct styles to create pragmatic, clear, and useful information to establish a consistent tone, style, and format between all of the messages you or your organization produces.

It is meant as a practical guide for anyone, regardless of political affiliation, and it is organized in such a way that a person new to political communication can learn to create convincing and thought-provoking op-eds, letters to the editor, press releases, social media posts, website content, and spoken messages.}}

{{cquote|''I've put in so many enigmas and puzzles that it will keep the professors busy for centuries arguing over what I meant, and that's the only way of insuring one's immortality.''|author=Richard Ellmann|source=''James Joyce'', Oxford University Press, New York, Revised Edition (1982), p. 521.}}&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[w:James Joyce|James Joyce's]] novel ''[[w:Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' is one of the most allusive works of literature in the Western canon. Ever since its publication in 1922, its encyclopaedic nature and voluminous display of erudition have proved stumbling blocks for many readers. All too often the reader's initial enthusiasm for the book is whittled away at the expense of a growing sense of bewilderment, as a mass of unexplained references and quotations piles up. Bewilderment inevitably gives rise to frustration, and this frustration provides the reader with an excuse to give up.

This wikibook aims to provide the reader of ''Ulysses'' with a set of line-by-line annotations and authoritative references which explain Joyce's allusions and allow the reader to enjoy the book without being overwhelmed by a rising tide of incomprehensible minutiae. It is assumed that the reader has read ''Ulysses'' at least once before, though first-time readers should also find the annotations useful; but no spoiler alerts will be provided when references are made to other parts of the novel. It is recommended that the first-time reader make a genuine effort to read the work through from cover to cover before seeking assistance from annotations or critical appraisals.

The annotations are being compiled with reference to the original edition (''editio princeps'') of ''Ulysses'', which was published in Paris on 2 February 1922 by Sylvia Beach's Shakespeare and Company. Subsequent editions of the novel have attempted to correct the many errata of the original, but the 1922 edition possesses a certain historical cachet that no subsequent edition can match. Cross-references are given in a five-digit format that cites the relevant page and line of the 1922 edition: 003.01 refers to the opening line of the novel and 732.22 to the closing line. In this wikibook each page of ''Ulysses'' will have its own dedicated page, which will contain both an accurate reproduction of the relevant page of ''Ulysses'' and, below it, a comprehensive list of annotations and errata.

This book is under development at [[Main Page|Wikibooks]], a site providing a collection of open-content textbooks. Anyone can edit this book, and all who are interested in contributing are encouraged to [[w:WP:BB|be bold]] and help to make this one of the most useful books on ''Ulysses'' available on the Internet. Please try to ensure that your contributions adhere to the style of existing annotations, and always include complete and authoritative references to support your annotations. Don't forget to add your name or username to the [[Annotations to James Joyce's Ulysses/Contributors|list of contributors]].

Welcome to the [[Main Page|Wikibook]] of annotations to James Joyce's novel ''Ulysses'', a [[w:wiki|wiki-based]] project which aims to provide readers of the novel with a comprehensive list of annotations explaining Joyce's innumerable quotations, allusions and references. When finished, it will also contain a list of errata and corrigenda to the original edition of 1922.

Please see the [[Annotations to James Joyce's Ulysses/Contents|Contents]] page for a full list of the eighteen episodes into which ''Ulysses'' is divided. If you wish to browse individual pages of the novel, see the [[Annotations to James Joyce's Ulysses/Page Index|Page Index]]. A PDF of the book will eventually be made available.

This Wikibook is a work in progress. Contributors are welcome and are encouraged to add their names or Wikibook Usernames to the [[Annotations to James Joyce's Ulysses/Contributors|list of contributors]].

&lt;span style=&quot;margin-left:5%;font-family:Times;&quot;&gt;Traditional media guidelines – Op-eds and letters to the editor&lt;/span&gt;}}
[[File:Writing a letter.jpg|thumb|alt=A close-up photograph of a fountain pen and a slightly out-of-focus piece of paper, possibly a newspaper.|However you choose to write your letter, use these tips to ensure its publication.]]
A letter to the editor is a short (~200 words) piece that addresses a particular article or subject from a recent edition of the publication. An op-ed, by the strictest definition, is a medium-length piece (~500 words) solicited by the publication to oppose the position of the editorial board.  This is where the term “op-ed” comes from: the “opposite of the editorial”, not “opinion-editorial”.  That said, the lines in today’s media are blurry. A letter to the editor can be much longer in some instances and an op-ed need not be solicited or be the opposite opinion of the editorial board.  Your situation will determine how you structure your piece. The editor may change it anyway.
{{clear}}

==Content==
Know your audience and what they can do to help your cause. Do not just express an opinion; advocate a position and give the reader the tools needed to take the next step. Advocating a position involves expressing your opinion and suggesting what the reader should do about it. If Problem X exists, advocate how to correct it. If Candidate X is the best person for the job, suggest ways to support that person. Examples of support include visiting a campaign or issue website, volunteering, or just by voting a particular way. Address the readership of the publication, not an individual or niche. Each publication has its own demographics, so don’t submit the same piece to multiple places. Writing to ''The New York Times'' regarding a local election is obviously a waste of time, but so is writing a partisan piece on a national issue for the local newspaper. Editors typically favor the expression of individual ideas over general talking points, and they are more likely to publish letters that include a story involving self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elements of Political Communication/References#CITEREFWahl-Jorgensen2001|Wahl-Jorgensen, &quot;Letters to the Editor as a Forum&quot;]], 314&amp;ndash;318.&lt;/ref&gt; Introduce a personal perspective to relate to the audience why your opinion is valid. You may be tempted to create a laundry list of facts and statistics, but that is not the purpose of an op-ed or letter to an editor. Rhetorical devices such as metaphors, short anecdotes, or reasonable appeals to emotion are more effective at convincing people of your point of view than an assortment of statistics.

==Format==
Your piece should be between 200-500 words long. Shorter pieces are acceptable but will not take up as much space on the published page. Details like font, margins, and other formatting options are not important unless your document uses non-traditional or awkward markup.  Making the process more difficult for the editor (such as submitting in .pdf format or via snail mail) makes it less likely your piece will be published.  Paragraph breaks will be determined by the editor, as will the headline.
===How-to===
Begin writing an op-ed or letter to the editor by concisely expressing how you feel about the issue in one or two sentences. In a few more sentences, explain the importance of the issue, though this may not be necessary if you’re writing about a national issue currently in the spotlight. Then, in one or two short paragraphs, elaborate on your reasons for having this opinion. Express what you believe your audience can do to further this particular cause. This call to action is important; without it, readers may not feel propelled to do anything, even if they agree with your point of view, unless you guide them in the right direction.

Go back to the beginning of your piece and briefly explain who you are and explain any relevant details. If possible, find a unique perspective from which you can view the issue and include it the introduction to gain readers' attention. Write a very brief conclusion, preferably a one sentence zinger that calls back to the unique perspective in the introduction. Writers often express their frustration with creating effective introductions and conclusions, but this strategy makes writing these sections an easier task.

Before submitting your piece, check to see if it answers the following questions:
* Who are you and how do you relate to X?
* Why is X important?
* What is your view on X?
* Why do you think that about X?
* What can we do about X?

This structure is not set in stone, but it will help the struggling writer reach 200-500 words.  Experiment to find your voice.

==Examples==
{{hiddenh3|Generic candidate support letter}}
{{quotation|The other day, I ran through my subdivision in Town X, where I have lived for the past few years.  As I weaved between mailboxes and skipped up curbs, I noticed a headline on the front of the ''Town Gazette''. It said “Candidate Y to Challenge Candidate X in Election”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This election will determine who will represent our community for many years to come. Representatives from this area vote on important problems that affect our lives, so we cannot afford to ignore these pressing issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am for Candidate X. I am against Candidate Y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Candidate X has many years of experience volunteering for his community by serving on various boards and committees.  This includes a few years on the Pertinent Review Board, which addressed the important issue of pertinence last year. He has consistently voted to help our citizens, as opposed to his opponent, who has avoided addressing the issues repeatedly.
I strongly recommend that voters research these candidates and their positions on these important issues by visiting this publication’s voter’s guide on the election.  Anyone can contact Candidate X's campaign by visiting example.com, facebook.com/example, or twitter.com/example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I doubt if my words will change how the candidates run their campaigns, but I can assure you they will affect how I run my workouts:  From now until election day, I will be running through Town X in my “Elect Candidate X” T-shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
-Name}}
This example is very generic, but this allows the writer to ensure he or she includes everything, and it allows for a broader application.  Whenever possible, be specific about your positive points.  For example, replace &quot;many years&quot; in the above letter with however many years of experience the candidate actually has (assuming the length is reasonable for the position sought).
{{hiddenh3|Generic issue support letter}}
{{quotation|Dear editor,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Boy, it's hot outside!  These are the days that make us stay inside and soak up that wonderfully cool air from our air conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But not everyone has this convenience.  Sometimes it's scary to think about the folks out there who may not be able to escape from the oppressive sun during heat waves like the one we're experiencing.  The elderly, especially, often have trouble in times like these.  I call my grandmother every day now to make sure she's okay and well hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Other people around town are suffering as well.  It seems like our society ought to be able to come up with a solution to this problem, but it always catches us by surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
That's why I support the expansion of the Generic Home Fund Grant program in our city.  The city disburses the grants to lower income residents trying to upgrade their homes to pay for things like efficient air conditioning units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We all take things for granted, sometimes, but the next time you're enjoying your cool home, think about your fellow neighbors.  Contact your city councilman today by visiting the city's website, example.com, and ask them to expand this program.  This isn't just for grandma; it's a good idea for our community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
-Name}}
This letter is less formal, but still concerns a serious subject in a respectful manner.  The sentence beginning with &quot;But&quot; in the second paragraph signals a shift to a more serious tone, but the style remains consistent.
==Review==
{{quiz|question=Which sentence is the most effective?
|a=I believe Candidate X is the right person for the job.
|b=Candidate X is the right person for the job.
|c=Vote for candidate X for Smith County Dog Catcher, Place 1 on November 2nd.
|d=Candidate X is the right person for the job, and I encourage voters to vote for him/her for Smith County Dog Catcher, Place 1 on November 2nd.
|answer='''D.''' The first and second choices offer an opinion, but no action for the reader to take. The third offers action, but no real opinion.}}
{{quiz|question=Which salutation is the most appropriate?
|a=Journalist X, your article last month was biased...
|b=Dear Hispanic readers of ''The Morning News'',...
|c=Dear readers,...
|d=To whom it may concern:...
|answer='''C.''' Salutations are rarely necessary for letters to the editor, and never needed in op-eds. If one is appropriate, however, use one that applies to all of your audience (or simply &quot;Dear editor&quot;). Newspapers rarely publish letters that address only a segment of their readers.}}
{{quiz|question=Which personal narrative is the most effective?
|a=I have lived in Town X for 12 years. For eight of those, I have served this community by volunteering for Foundation Y. During this session, the city council will consider HB XXXX, which will cut state funding for this wonderful program.
|b=I have lived in Town X for 12 years, the last eight of which I have spent volunteering for various organizations including Foundation A, Foundation B, Foundation Y, and many other organizations. During this session, the city council will consider HB XXXX, which will cut funding for Foundation Y, which is a great program.
|c=During this session, the city council will consider HB XXXX, which will cut state funding for Foundation Y, for which I have volunteered at during the last eight years. I have lived in Town X for 12 years.
|d=I have lived in Town X for 12 years. For eight of those, I have served this community by volunteering for Foundation Y, but during this session, the city council will consider HB XXXX, which will cut state funding for this program I've worked so hard for.
|answer='''A.''' The second choice adds superfluous information that can distract from the flow of the narrative. Assume that readers are only interested in the essential parts of your story. The third choice is backwards: The personal aspect should function as a segue into your point, not the other way around. The fourth choice is too personal, in that it leads the reader to believe that the issue is really about you, not the foundation.}}
{{quiz|question=Which appeal is the most effective?
|a=During the 2007&amp;ndash;2008 school year, the UIL conducted 10,117 tests for anabolic steroids, including 6,455 males and 3,662 females. There were two confirmed positive results. 2008 Fall: 18,817 tests, 7 CPs.  2009 Spring: 16,260 tests, 8 CPs.  2009 Fall: 3,133 tests, 2 CPs.  2010 Spring: 3,308 tests, 0 CPs.  2010 Fall: 2,083 tests, 1 CP.
|b=Imagine spending millions of dollars every year to test tens of thousands of people for a condition you didn’t think they had. That's high school steroid testing in a nutshell.
|c=Imagine spending millions of dollars in 2007 to test 6,455 male and 3,662 female high school athletes at random for steroids.
|d=We spent millions of dollars to conduct 10,117 tests for anabolic steroids in high school athletes in 2007, and we found only two positives. We almost doubled that in 2008, and then we've cut the program substantially since then.
|answer='''B.''' Although not as precise, the second choice offers a shorter, more rhetorical version of the first sentence. If necessary, embed the most important statistics in the remainder of the piece.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">A system of differential equations is a collection of two or more differential equations, which each ODE may depend upon the other unknown function.

For example consider the equations:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}x'(t)=2x(t)+y(t)\\ y'(t)=3y(t)\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

In this case the equation for differential equation for &lt;math&gt;x'(t)&lt;/math&gt; depends on both &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt;.  In principle we could also allow &lt;math&gt;y'(t)&lt;/math&gt; to depend on both &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, but it is not necessary.

Notice in some cases we find a solution for a system of ODE's.  For example in the case above, because &lt;math&gt;y'&lt;/math&gt; doesn't depend on &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; we can solve the second equation (by separating variables or using an integrating factor) to get that &lt;math&gt;y=C_2e^{3t}&lt;/math&gt;.  Since there will be a second constant when we solve the first ODE, we choose to call the constant here &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;.  Now we can plug this into the first equation to get that:
&lt;math&gt;x'=2x+C_2e^{3t}&lt;/math&gt;.  We can solve this equation by using an integrating factor to get that:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}x(t)=C_1e^{2t}+C_2e^{3t}\\y(t)=C_2e^{3t}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

In other cases a clever change of variables allows one to separate the two ODE's.
Consider the system 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}x_1'(t)=4x_1(t)+2x_2(t)\\ x_2'(t)=2x_1(t)+4x_2(t)\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;.  

If we let &lt;math&gt;y_1=x_1+x_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2=x_1-x_2&lt;/math&gt;.  Then we find that  

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}y_1'(t)=6y_1(t)\\ y_2'(t)=2y_2(t)\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

and each of these are easy to solve: &lt;math&gt;y_1=C_1e^{6t}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2=C_2e^{2t}&lt;/math&gt;.  And so we find &lt;math&gt;x_1=C_1e^{6t}+C_2e^{2t}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_1=C_1e^{6t}-C_2e^{2t}&lt;/math&gt;.  It turns out to be helpful with systems to work with vectors and matrices so if we introduce &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\vec{x}(t)=\begin{pmatrix}x_1(t)\\x_2(t)\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;  Then the above system can be re-written as:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\vec{x}(t)=\begin{pmatrix}4 &amp; 2 \\ 2 &amp; 4\end{pmatrix}\vec{x}(t).&lt;/math&gt;

And we have solutions &lt;math&gt;\vec{x}_1(t)=C_1e^{6t}\begin{pmatrix}1\\1\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{x}_2(t)=C_2e^{2t}\begin{pmatrix}1\\-1\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the solutions we found were of the for &lt;math&gt;e^{\lambda t}\vec{\xi}&lt;/math&gt; for some constant vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{\xi}&lt;/math&gt;.  Using this as motivation we will investigate the question, when does 
&lt;math&gt;\vec{x}(t)=e^{\lambda t}\vec{\xi}&lt;/math&gt; solve the system:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\vec{x}(t)=A\vec{x}(t).&lt;/math&gt;

for some constant matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

By substituting into the equation we see that:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt}(e^{\lambda t}\vec{\xi})&amp;=A(e^{\lambda t}\vec{\xi})\\
\lambda e^{\lambda t}\vec{\xi}&amp;=e^{\lambda t}A\vec{\xi}\\
e^{\lambda t}(A-\lambda I)\vec{\xi}&amp;=\vec{0}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;e^{\lambda t}\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, the only way for the left hand side to be &lt;math&gt;\vec{0}&lt;/math&gt; is if &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is an eigenvalue and &lt;math&gt;\vec{\xi}&lt;/math&gt; is a corresponding eigenvector.

This is not quite the end of the story.  When the matrix is real we shall consider the following cases:

===Real Distinct Eigenvalues===

===Complex Eigenvalues===

=== Real Repeated Eigenvalues ===

[[File:HelenThomasAndBarackObama2009.jpg|thumb|right|Your relationship with traditional media outlets is important.]]
Press releases are official releases from your organization regarding specific news, issues, or events. The purpose of a press release can vary widely; this chapter will focus on using this tool to communicate with professional news media outlets. Press releases are often written with a style that mimics that of local and major publications with the hope that the recipient will reprint the release verbatim.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elements of Political Communication/References#CITEREFJacobs1999|Jacobs, ''Preformulating the News'']], 305.&lt;/ref&gt; The likelihood of an outlet publishing a straight news release decreases as the publication increases in size. That said, even if the release is not printed verbatim, it may influence the coverage of a particular topic or event.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elements of Political Communication/References#CITEREFTewksburyJonesPeskeRaymond2000|Tewksbury et al., &quot;Interaction of News and Advocate Frames&quot;]], 804.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

==Content==
Avoid editorial comments in press releases; state only the facts and pertinent information regarding the issue, such as the time, date, and location of an event. Always include personal contact information at the top and bottom of the release. This should be an individual within your organization that has an excellent understanding of the topic and will be available to communicate with interested publications. Journalists and editors choose which stories to explore; therefore, an accurate and descriptive headline and lead section may earn their attention. Finally, include a very brief boilerplate, a final paragraph that contains basic information about your organization, including a broad description of your activities. Consider writing at least two versions of the boilerplate: one for organizations that clearly already know what your organization does, and another for those that may be less familiar.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elements of Political Communication/References#CITEREFTreadwellTreadwell2005|Treadwell and Treadwell, ''Public Relations Writing'']], 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
Though there is no required length, the average press release is between 300 and 500 words long. The importance and complexity of your subject will determine the length of your release, but in general, the entire document should be able to fit on a single page. Although the ''Associated Press Stylebook'' does not contain a set format for press releases, there are some formatting points to note.&lt;ref&gt;For an example of a press release from the Associated Press itself, see [[Elements of Political Communication/References#CITEREFAP2012|Associated Press, &quot;2012 AP Stylebook Adds Fashion&quot;]].&lt;/ref&gt; Use a readable, 12-point typeface. Contrary to popular belief, typefaces such as Times New Roman do not increase readability;&lt;ref&gt;[[Elements of Political Communication/References#CITEREFDelangeEsterhuizenBeatty1993|Delange, Esterhuizen, and Beatty, &quot;Performance Differences&quot;]], 241.&lt;/ref&gt; however, it is advisable to use a widely-accepted font throughout the release. Avoid all instances of formatting for emphasis except where noted in the [[Elements of Political Communication/Press release guidelines#Template|template]]. Include a centered &quot;# # #&quot; at the end of the release.

Ensure that any images you include in the release are prepared for publication. Use a popular digital format, such as .PNG or .JPG. Since most digital cameras take larger pictures than are necessary for publication, resize the image to no more than 700 pixels wide. Include attribution information for the image, and only images for which you have explicit permission to use, both from the photographer and the subjects photographed.&lt;ref&gt;It is generally good practice to acquire explicit consent from a non-public figure before distributing an image of the person. See [[Elements of Political Communication/References#CITEREFKrages2003|Krages, &quot;The Photographer's Right&quot;]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===Template===
Include the elements below in your release. The organization logo is optional, but all other information should be included in the correct format.

'''Local Political Party launches new website at Executive Committee meeting'''&lt;br /&gt;
CITY, State (September 16, 2011) - The Local Political Party revealed its new website, at http://www.example.org, on Tuesday.  The site includes information and resources, but also emphasizes engagement from residents.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Among many new functions, the site allows readers to share or comment on individual articles through social media networks.  The first of its kind among political sites in the area, the &quot;Speak Up&quot; page connects residents with the editorial pages of local publications, allowing citizens to express their views quickly and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The redesign is the first part of a communications strategy from the Local Political Party to engage constituents and create an open political environment in which political organizations respond to constituents’ viewpoints openly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For additional inquiries, please contact Fake Name at email@example.com, (555) 555-5555.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;cite&gt;you can assume that license could be BSD (it seems to be the softest one).
But if you know about another standard license which doesn't require to

This ''book'' does not appear to be a book but it seems to be either an article (which is more at home on Wikipedia) or part of an already existing book.  Where does it belong?

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This template determines whether its first parameter can be parsed by parser function [[mw:Help:Extension:ParserFunctions#.23titleparts|#titleparts]].
=== Usage ===
: &lt;code&gt;{{((}}parsable{{!}}&lt;/code&gt;&amp;lt;parameter&amp;gt;&lt;code&gt;{{))}}&lt;/code&gt;
asks #titleparts to extract the ''second'' part of &amp;lt;parameter&amp;gt;.  It returns true (i.e., non-blank) iff this request produces something different from &amp;lt;parameter&amp;gt;.  If &amp;lt;parameter&amp;gt; is blank, the result of the test is false (because &lt;code&gt;{{((}}#titleparts:&lt;/code&gt;&amp;lt;parameter&amp;gt;&lt;code&gt;{{!}}1{{!}}2{{))}}&lt;/code&gt; then returns a blank string, which is not different from &amp;lt;parameter&amp;gt;). 

&lt;includeonly&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Multi-jointed bosses are an efficient, but rarely used, technique to animate cool looking bosses.  Unlike most bosses where the entire boss is one sprite, with multi-jointed bosses, every body part is an individual sprite that rotate around each other.

Here is how to program a simple robotic arm:


1) Draw the sprite for the shoulder, upper arm, elbow, lower arm and hand at 16 equally spaced angles.


2) Now you need to define 10 registers:

a) shoulder angle

b) elbow angle

c) shoulder angle key frame

d) elbow angle key frame

e) shoulder x

f) shoulder y

g) angle

h) amplitude

i) result x

j) result y


3) Write a routine that converts between polar coordiantes (angle,amplitude) to rectangular coordinates (x,y).


4) Write a routine that displays a sprite with the center being defined by resulting rectangular coordinates, with the angle being used to determing the sprite's attributes.


5) Write a routine that increments the shoulder and elbow angles towards their coorisponding key frame angles.


6) Now put all this together in one big routine:

- The bosses AI determines the key frame angles and shoulder coordinates.

- increment the shoulder and elbow angles towards their coorisponding key frame angles.

- copy shoulder coordinates to result coordinates

- copy shoulder angle to angle

- display 16x16 shoulder sprite

- set amplitude to 24 pixels

- convert between polar to rectangular cooridinates

- display 32x32 upper arm sprite

- convert between polar to rectangular cooridinates

- display 16x16 elbow sprite

- copy elbow angle to angle

- convert between polar to rectangular cooridinates

- display 32x32 lower arm sprite

- convert between polar to rectangular cooridinates

- display 16x16 hand sprite

      <comment>The V tex coord must be (bitmap_height / atlas_height) because each glyph occupies a variable amount of vertical space. Using 1 and 0 (as before, when each texture contained a single full glyph) for the top and bottom of a glyph will produce artifacts.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:OpenGL Tutorial Text 01.png|thumb|Optimized text rendering with a texture atlas]]

= Introduction =

In the first text rendering tutorial, we were uploading a new texture to the graphics card for each character that we drew.
This is of course very wasteful. It would be much better to have all possible character images stored permanently on the graphics card.
A simple way to do this is to have many textures, one for each character, so that we just have to switch between textures when drawing a quad.
However, this means we can only draw a quad at a time, and if we have a lot of text that means a lot of OpenGL calls.
A slightly more complex way is to have a single, large texture that contains all the characters,
and to properly set the texture coordinates for each quad so that the right character will be rendered.
This is also known as a [[w:texture atlas|texture atlas]].

= Creating a texture atlas =

A texture atlas is basically a big texture which contains many small images that are packed together.
If all the subimages have the same size, it is rather easy to create a tightly packed atlas.
However, we have already seen that the glyph images that FreeType produces have wildly varying sizes.
This is true even when using [[w:monospaced font|monospaced fonts]]!
Although there are various methods to efficiently pack a set of arbitrarily sized rectangles,
we will use a very simple method in this tutorial:
we will put all characters next to each other in a single row.

Before we can create the atlas itself though, we need to know the combined width of all the glyph images, and the height of the tallest glyph.
Assuming we have already initialized FreeType, have loaded a font, and set the font size, it is a simple matter:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
FT_GlyphSlot g = face-&gt;glyph;
int w = 0;
int h = 0;

for(int i = 32; i &lt; 128; i++) {
  if(FT_Load_Char(face, i, FT_LOAD_RENDER)) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Loading character %c failed!\n&quot;, i);
    continue;
  }

  w += g-&gt;bitmap.width;
  h = std::max(h, g-&gt;bitmap.rows);

  /* you might as well save this value as it is needed later on */
  int atlas_width = w;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Remember that the variable &quot;g&quot; is just a shortcut to save some typing, and in that spirit, we also used the &lt;code&gt;max()&lt;/code&gt; function, so you should put &lt;code&gt;#include &lt;algorithm&gt;&lt;/code&gt; at the top of the source.
We skip the first 32 ASCII characters, since they are just control codes.

Now that we know the width and height of our atlas, we can create an empty texture for it:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
GLuint tex;
glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0);
glGenTextures(1, &amp;tex);
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, tex);
glPixelStorei(GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, 1);

glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_ALPHA, w, h, 0, GL_ALPHA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, 0);
&lt;/source&gt;

We used a null pointer to tell OpenGL that we will fill in the contents of the texture later.
Again, don't forget about the GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT.
Now we are ready to paste the glyph images into the texture atlas.
We will use the very convenient &lt;code&gt;glTexSubImage2D()&lt;/code&gt; function for this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
int x = 0;

for(int i = 32; i &lt; 128; i++) {
  if(FT_Load_Char(face, i, FT_LOAD_RENDER))
    continue;

  glTexSubImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, x, 0, g-&gt;bitmap.width, g-&gt;bitmap.rows, GL_ALPHA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, g-&gt;bitmap.buffer);

  x += g-&gt;bitmap.width;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

That's it, our texture atlas is finished... except that we should try to remember where in the atlas we can find individual characters.

= Caching glyph metrics and texture offsets =

When we are building our vertex buffer, we need to know the right texture coordinates to use.
Most importantly, we need to know the x offset, the rest of the information can be found in FreeType's &lt;code&gt;face-&gt;glyph&lt;/code&gt; struct.
However, calling &lt;code&gt;FT_Load_Char&lt;/code&gt; all the time is also not so efficient,
so the best thing to do is to store all the information we need to render text in our own cache.
Since we only use the ASCII character set, we can just make an array containing the information for all ASCII characters:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
struct character_info {
  float ax; // advance.x
  float ay; // advance.y
  
  float bw; // bitmap.width;
  float bh; // bitmap.rows;
  
  float bl; // bitmap_left;
  float bt; // bitmap_top;
  
  float tx; // x offset of glyph in texture coordinates
} c[128];
&lt;/source&gt;

In the for loop where we upload the glyph images to the texture, we fill in this array:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  c[*p].ax = g-&gt;advance.x &gt;&gt; 6;
  c[*p].ay = g-&gt;advance.y &gt;&gt; 6;

  c[*p].bw = g-&gt;bitmap.width;
  c[*p].bh = g-&gt;bitmap.rows;

  c[*p].bl = g-&gt;bitmap_left;
  c[*p].bt = g-&gt;bitmap_top;

  c[*p].tx = (float)x / w;
&lt;/source&gt;

Although the struct contains only members of type float, you could use (u)int16_t or even (u)int8_t for them, depending on the maximum size of the glyphs and the atlas.
Since we are dealing with ASCII, we could also have omitted the copy of the &lt;code&gt;g-&gt;advance.y&lt;/code&gt; value, since it should be 0 anyway.
If you want to go beyond ASCII though, it is best not to make any assumptions.

= Rendering lines of text using the atlas =

Now that we really have all the information we need,
we can build a vertex buffer that contains all the information necessary to render a complete line of text.
Let's adapt the &lt;code&gt;render_text()&lt;/code&gt; function from the previous tutorial to use the texture atlas:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
void render_text(const char *text, float x, float y, float sx, float sy) {
  struct point {
    GLfloat x;
    GLfloat y;
    GLfloat s;
    GLfloat t;
  } coords[6 * strlen(text)];

  int n = 0;

  for(const char *p = text; *p; p++) { 
    float x2 =  x + c[*p].bl * sx;
    float y2 = -y - c[*p].bt * sy;
    float w = c[*p].bw * sx;
    float h = c[*p].bh * sy;

    /* Advance the cursor to the start of the next character */
    x += c[*p].ax * sx;
    y += c[*p].ay * sy;

    /* Skip glyphs that have no pixels */
    if(!w || !h)
      continue;

    coords[n++] = (point){x2,     -y2    , c[*p].tx,                                            0};
    coords[n++] = (point){x2 + w, -y2    , c[*p].tx + c[*p].bw / atlas_width,   0};
    coords[n++] = (point){x2,     -y2 - h, c[*p].tx,                                          c[*p].bh / atlas_height}; //remember: each glyph occupies a different amount of vertical space
    coords[n++] = (point){x2 + w, -y2    , c[*p].tx + c[*p].bw / atlas_width,   0};
    coords[n++] = (point){x2,     -y2 - h, c[*p].tx,                                          c[*p].bh / atlas_height};
    coords[n++] = (point){x2 + w, -y2 - h, c[*p].tx + c[*p].bw / atlas_width, c[*p].bh / atlas_height};
  }

  glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof coords, coords, GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW);
  glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, 0, n);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

First we define a struct to hold the vertex and texture coordinates for each point, to make it slightly easier to write the code to fill in all the values.
We need 6 points for each character we will render, since we have to use GL_TRIANGLES instead of a GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP to be able to render separate quads.
In the loop, we perform the same calculations as before, but using the cached glyph metrics.
We add an optimisation to skip drawing glyphs that have zero width and/or height, such as the space character.
After the loop has filled in our vertex buffer, we just need to upload it to the graphics card, and tell it to render all the triangles.

=== Exercises ===

* Make a &lt;code&gt;struct atlas&lt;/code&gt; that holds the texture and cache for a given font and font size, so that you do not have any global variables anymore. Make it so you can pass a pointer to such as struct to &lt;code&gt;render_text()&lt;/code&gt;.
* If you draw misaligned text, you should see much more rendering artifacts than in the previous tutorial. Can you explain why this happens? How would you prevent this from happening?
* Use an index buffer object so that you only need to have 4 points per character in the vertex buffer. Is this a worthwhile optimization?
* Since we are dealing with pixel-aligned coordinates, we don't really need floating point coordinates. OpenGL also supports 16 bit integer coordinates (GL_SHORT). Convert the glyph metrics cache and vertex buffer to use that instead, and change the shaders as necessary.
* If you have a VBO with GL_SHORT coordinates, is it still worthwhile to use an IBO?
* The texture atlas techniques also makes it easy to cache the VBO (and IBO), so that you don't have to recalculate anything if the text doesn't change. It is also very common that only the last part of the text changes. How could you optimize this?

=== Troubleshooting ===

If you are having trouble getting it to render correctly, go through this list.

* In newer versions of OpenGL the value GL_ALPHA is deprecated for use in the function glTexImage2D. Replace it with GL_RED and modify the shader to read the red channel to fix this. See the [http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glTexImage2D.xml glTexImage2D documentation] for list of valid values.

      <text xml:space="preserve">These ''Annotations to James Joyce's Ulysses'' are based on the original edition of the novel, published by Sylvia Beach's Shakespeare and Company in Paris on 2 February 1922. Episode divisions and titles, though not present in the ''editio princeps'', have been added to avoid confusion and to aid the modern reader. Joyce himself divided the novel into three parts, to which he gaves the titles the ''Telemachia'', the ''Odyssey'' and the ''Nostos'' (or &quot;Return Home&quot;), though these titles were suppressed when the book was published.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book
  |editor1-first= Stuart
  |editor1-last= Gilbert
  |title = Letters of James Joyce
  |volume = I:113
  |publisher = Viking Press
  |location = New York
  |year = 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; I have adopted the standard spellings used by contemporary Joyceans. Joyce's idiosyncratic spellings derive from Victor Bérard's two-volume ''Les Phéniciens et l’Odyssée'', which he consulted in 1918 in the [[w:Zentralbibliothek Zürich|Central library of Zürich]].&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Ulysses_(novel)#Structure|Ulysses]].&lt;/ref&gt; All eighteen titles occur in the two [[Annotations to James Joyce's Ulysses/Appendices/Schemata|schemata]] which became public after the appearance of the novel and which outline its structure and Homeric parallels.

'''ULYSSES BY JAMES JOYCE'''{{spaces|5}}The paper wrapper or dust jacket with which copies of the original edition of ''Ulysses'' were covered featured the two colours of the Greek flag - blue and white - at Joyce's own request.

On 2 February 1922 Joyce, his future wife Nora Barnacle and a number of their friends went to Ferrari's restaurant in Paris to celebrate the publication of ''Ulysses'', which had taken place that very day, the author's fortieth birthday.

{{epigraph|quote=''He had brought with him a package containing his copy of ''Ulysses'', and placed it under his chair. Nora remarked that he had thought about the book for sixteen years, and spent seven years writing it. Everyone asked to see it opened, but he seemed to shrink from producing it. After the dessert he at last untied the parcel and laid the book on the table. It was bound in the Greek colours - white letters on a blue field - that he considered lucky for him, and suggesting the myth of Greece and Homer, the white island raising from the sea.''&lt;ref&gt;Nutting had mixed the exact shade of blue for him, since the binders could not get it right and needed something to copy. [Ellmann's footnote. Myron Nutting (1890-1972) was an American artist who became acquainted with Joyce in Paris in 1921; Ellmann (op. cit.), p. 516.]&lt;/ref&gt; ''There was a toast to the book and its author which left Joyce deeply moved.''|cite=Richard Ellmann, ''James Joyce'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, Revised edition (1982), p. 524.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Goals==
This book will teach you to use Direct3D, covering various topics such as lighting, normal mapping, texturing and more.

==Requirements==
The DirectX 10 tutorials are written using C++ with HLSL and use shader version 4.0 and 5.0. Please ensure that your hardware can support these. Running on software mode has some problems, especially being terribly, horribly slow.

Before writing any graphics code we'll need to have the tools to do so. The first of these tools is a compiler that is preferably built into a nice IDE. The one I use and will be supplying project files for is Visual Studio 2010. There are several others available and some are even free off the net. I'll leave that up to you to decide which one you prefer.

The second tool you will need is the DirectX SDK. It can be downloaded from Microsoft's website for free. After downloading and installing the SDK you will have the files necessary to compile DirectX programs. You will also notice it comes with samples, tools, and documentation. The documentation is pretty good, it also has some very simple examples under the DirectX 10 tutorials section which also applies to DirectX 11. The tools that come with it are also useful, we'll be using the DDS texture tool quite often. The sample browser also provides some simple examples to achieve certain effects you may be looking to do. The samples will generally also have some of the new features of the latest SDK demonstrated.

The June 2010 SDK can be downloaded at: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=6812

With both installed you can now setup your IDE to work with the DirectX 11 SDK. Please note that some IDEs will need to be installed first before installing the DirectX SDK.

==Credits==
This book is a copy of Craig's work at http://rastertek.com/. All credit shall go to him. He's putting some hard work into this.

      <comment>/* Schools */ Toning down claims regarding cellphone addiction. Yes, cellphone addiction may be possible. But, AFAIK, doctors don't know for sure whether or not it is. And there's definitely no such addiction discussed in the [[w:DSM-5|DSM-5]].</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter is about the effect of [[wikipedia: mobile phone|mobile telephones]] on the ways people interact.  When new communication methods become available, a shift from existing modes of interaction to new methods occurs.  This phenomena was present in the years following the invention of the printing press &lt;ref&gt;The Gutenberg Galaxy. (1962). University of Toronto Press. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gutenberg_Galaxy]&lt;/ref&gt;, the radio &lt;ref name = &quot;Media Effects&quot;&gt; McQuail, D. (2000). McQuail’s Mass Communication Theory (4th ed.). Sage Publications Ltd.

American Psychologist 53.9:1017-031. [http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1998-10886-001.]&lt;/ref&gt;, and social networking &lt;ref&gt; Wikibooks. (2011). Lentis: Social Networks. Wikibooks. [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Lentis/Social_Networks]&lt;/ref&gt;.  Many of these technologies have similarities to cell phones, which suggests that the technology has significantly changed the way people interact with one another. 

==Cell Phones Overview==

===History of the Cell Phone===

In 1973, Martin Cooper of Motorola made the first call on a portable cell phone. &lt;ref&gt;http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa070899.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This phone sold for $3,500 in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;http://inventors.about.com/cs/inventorsalphabet/a/martin_cooper.htm&lt;/ref&gt; As technology progressed, cellular systems began to sprawl across the United States. Cellular network technology advanced from analog to digital to broadband. All of these factors lowered the cost of the cell phone and made them available to the general public. The current cost of a cell phone today ranges from $39.99-$399.99.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.att.com/shop/wireless/devices/cellphones.html?WT.srch=1&amp;wtPaidSearchTerm=cell+phones&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Generation Cellular Networks===

The first public automated cellular networks launched in Tokyo in 1979, and within five years the network serviced the entire Japanese population &lt;ref&gt; Wikipedia. (2011). History of Mobile Phones. Wikipedia. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_mobile_phones#First_generation:_Cellular_networks]&lt;/ref&gt;. Several other countries followed suit in the early 1980s.  These early markets included international roaming as well as the ability to transfer calls from one site to the next as the user traveled from one coverage area to the next. 

Modern commercial cellular technology was developed in 1983 by AT&amp;T &lt;ref&gt; Milestones in AT&amp;T Hsitory. [http://www.corp.att.com/history/milestones.html]&lt;/ref&gt; .  This technology had multiple base stations whose coverage areas overlapped using the same frequencies with little or no interference.  Reducing coverage area sizes allowed for more base stations and therefore more capacity throughout the 1980s.

===Modern Cellular Networks===

[[File:Mobile phone evolution Japan1997-2004.jpg|thumb|Mobile phone evolution in Japan from 1997-2004, from second to third generation models.]] Second, third, and even fourth generation cellular networks have emerged since the early 1990s. Second generation networks introduced text messaging, ringtone downloads, and logo downloads &lt;ref name= &quot;Modern Network&quot;&gt; Karjaluoto, H. (2006). An investigation of third generation (3G) mobile technologies and services. Contemporary Management Research, 2(2), 91–104. [http://www.cmr-journal.org/article/download/222/512] &lt;/ref&gt;.  Beginning in 2001, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3g 3G networks] allowed cellular phone users to indulge in new services such as internet browsing, e-mail, instant messaging, video-conferencing, and digital television.  These networks also allowed for location-based services such as turn-by-turn directions &lt;ref name= &quot;Modern Network&quot; /&gt;. Finally, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4g fourth generation networks] will increase the speed of the third generation network features, allowing for secure browsing and media streaming.

===Modern Phone Capabilities &amp; the Smartphone===
The cell phone originally served the single purpose of allowing people to talk to each other. Cell phone manufacturers realized they could expand upon the features of the cell phone and began to include: address books, text messaging, email, web surfing, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://insite.artinstitutes.edu/the-history-and-evolution-of-cell-phones-57809.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;. These new phones with various capabilities are known as smartphones, and the term &quot;mobile device&quot; is being used more frequently to emphasize that the cell phone is no longer just a tool for verbal communication. These features have shifted the cell phone from being a verbal communication tool to a multimedia tool.

Despite these changes, the cell phone still appears to be used as a tool for social connection and interaction. Games such as Farmville allow users to interact with other players and compare stats and scores.&lt;ref&gt;http://company.zynga.com/games/farmville&lt;/ref&gt; Although modes of interaction between people may have changed (i.e. texting instead of calling), the need for social interaction has not.

== Benefits of Cell Phones for Face-to-Face Interaction ==
Cell phones can be used to facilitate face to face interactions.  Cell phones allow a user to quickly and effectively connect with people and set up face to face meetings.  Users no longer need a Rolodex or contact book; all the information needed to get in touch with somebody is stored in a cell phone.  This allows a cell phone user to carry all of this information around at all times, so they can easily contact anyone in any situation&lt;ref name= &quot;benefits&quot;&gt; Latest Technology Blog. (2009). 10 benefits of cell phones!. [http://www.techacid.com/2009/03/21/1o-benefits-of-cell-phones/]&lt;/ref&gt;.  

===Cell Phones In Developing Countries===

Cell phones have also been shown to facilitate social interactions in developing countries.  A recent study on Kenya,a country that has seen a significant rise in cell phone use in the past couple years &lt;ref name = &quot;Kenya Stats&quot;&gt; AudienceScapes. (2010). Mobile Communications in Kenya. [http://www.audiencescapes.org/country-profiles/kenya/media-and-communication-overview/mobile-communications/mobile-communications-]&lt;/ref&gt;, shows that cell phones actually help people interact face to face.  Kenyans that used cell phones had larger social networks than Kenyans without them.  In addition, Kenyans with cell phones had stronger and more meaningful relationships with people in their social networks than those who did not use cell phones.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shrum&quot;&gt; Shrum, Wesley, Paul Nyaga Mbatia, Antony Palackal, Dan-Bright S. Dzorgbo, Ricardo B. Duque, and Marcus Antonius Ynalvez. (2010). Mobile Phones and Core Network Growth in Kenya: Strengthening Weak Ties. Social Science Research. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar effects can be seen in Nigeria, which has also experienced a rapid proliferation of cell phones&lt;ref&gt;Ghana Business News. (2009). Nigeria mobile phone subscribers reach 68 million. [http://www.ghanabusinessnews.com/2009/06/19/nigeria-mobile-phone-subscribers-reach-68-million/]&lt;/ref&gt;.  With the increase in cell phones, Nigerians are expanding and strengthening their social networks, which is facilitating more face to face interaction &lt;ref&gt;Smith D. J. (2006). Cell Phones, Social Inequality, and Contemporary Culture in Nigeria. Canadian Journal of African Studies / Revue Canadienne des Études Africaines. Vol. 40, No. 3, pp. 496-523. Canadian Association of African Studies. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/25433906]&lt;/ref&gt;. Cell phones provided a crucial link to other people and a valuable resource for managing social networks and interactions.

===Cell Phones Increasing Face to Face Interactions===

Cell phones have also been shown to increase face to face interactions in young adults.  A study done on high school students showed that cell phones helped them associate friends with a phone number, picture, email, and facebook. This strengthened their relationship and promoted face to face interaction&lt;ref&gt; Corbett A. (2009). Cellular Phones Influences and Impacts on Social Iterations and Interpersonal Relationships. [http://www.unh.edu/sociology/media/pdfs-journal2009/Corbett2009.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt;.

Cell phone interactions are almost always preceded by face to face interactions.  By allowing users to communicate while they are physically apart, cell phones increase the chance of another face to face contact &lt;ref name = &quot;Geser&quot;&gt; Geser Hans: Towards a Sociological Theory of the Mobile Phone. In: Sociology in Switzerland: Sociology of the Mobile Phone. Online Publications, Zuerich, March 2004 (Release 3.0).  [http://socio.ch/mobile/t_geser1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers have also found that there is a positive link between face to face interaction and cell phone usage &lt;ref name=&quot;UM Research&quot;&gt; Goscicki C. (2011). Study Discovers How Cell Phones Use Affects Social Interactions. The Michigan Daily.[http://www.michigandaily.com/news/%E2%80%98u%E2%80%99-researchers-identify-link-between-cell-phones-and-socialization-habits]&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the more people engage in face to face interactions, the higher their frequency of cell phone use &lt;ref&gt;http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/cyber.2009.0314&lt;/ref&gt;.  This research challenges the idea that cell phone conversations and text messaging is replacing face to face interaction, and claims that cell phones help social interactions between friends and family&lt;ref name=&quot;UM Research&quot; /&gt;.

Conversations are sparked by cell phones. Debates about different brands and operating systems are common. It is normal to hear cell phone users defending their personal phone or comparing it to a co-worker's or friend's.

An article suggests that a high frequency of cell phone use allows people to enlarge their social network. By doing so, they are exposed to more opportunities for interpersonal communication &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563210003638&lt;/ref&gt;. In this way, a mobile phone can ultimately create new relationships and strengthen existing social bonds. Texting further allows people to communicate with others without interrupting ongoing communication, making it a useful tool for maintaining relationships.

== Arguments Against the Use of Cell Phones ==

=== &quot;Present Absence&quot; ===
Cell phones penetrate people’s everyday life and facilitate convenience in communication. With this technology, people are less dependent on location-based social networks and can rapidly change their social space &lt;ref name=&quot;Truch &amp; Hulme, 2004&quot;&gt;Truch, A., &amp; Hulme, M. (2004). Exploring the implications for social identity of the new sociology of the mobile phone. global and the local in mobile communications: places, images, people and connections’ conference, Budapest. [http://obviousmag.org/archives/uploads/2004/2004071101_Mobile.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;. The theory of present absence suggests that individuals can be physically present in one place while interacting with other people through cell phones at the same time &lt;ref name=&quot;Fortunati, 2002&quot;&gt;Fortunati, L. (2002). The mobile phone: Towards new categories and social relations 1. Information, Communication &amp; Society, 5(4), 513–528. [http://www.mendeley.com/research/the-mobile-phone-towards-new-categories-and-social-relations-1/]&lt;/ref&gt;. Despite one's physical present, a cell phone can draw individuals’ attention at any time after a ring or buzz, since social norms demand that people response immediately. One researcher observed that when an individual answers their cell phone, the rest of the people in the face-to-face conversation may show significant vulnerability and unease. This can cause social anxiety  such as feeling left alone, insecurity and feeling unimportant, as well as annoyance towards the person taking the phone call &lt;ref name=&quot;Humphreys, 2005&quot;&gt;Humphreys, L. (2005). Cellphones in public: social interactions in a wireless era. New media &amp; society, 7(6), 810. [http://interruptions.net/literature/Humphreys-NewMediaSociety05.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The limited cognitive capacity of humans may also serve to explain the present absence phenomenon&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load&lt;/ref&gt;. People's attention and performance of various cognitive abilities are reduced when they are engaged in multiple activities&lt;ref&gt;http://php.scripts.psu.edu/users/o/o/oob100/127TOCOMMJ.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus carrying out two activities at the same time such as participating in a face to face conversation while being on the phone may represent a cognitive overload on the user. Their cognitive resources utilized for competing tasks will be assigned to those of the highest priority. An example of this is the reduction in walking pace of a pedestrian sending a text message. Cell phone users also tend to be less aware of their surroundings. This can be supported by real-life situations such as people falling into lakes while texting. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.theblaze.com/stories/embarrassed-mom-falls-into-lake-michigan-while-texting/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infringement on Social Boundaries ===
Cell phones are also criticized for blurring public and private social spaces. A study conducted in Hong Kong suggests that most phone calls to immediate family members and friends are made on streets and other public places, in spite of the fact that only 16.1% of those surveyed think this is appropriate cell phone ettiquette &lt;ref name=&quot;Wei &amp; Leung, February&quot;&gt;Wei, R., &amp; Leung, L. (1999). Blurring public and private behaviors in public space: policy challenges in the use and improper use of the cell phone. Telematics and Informatics, 16(1-2), 11-26. doi:10.1016/S0736-5853(99)00016-7 [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=338767]&lt;/ref&gt;. These calls inevitably introduce private issues, such as “business deals, lovers’ quarrels, and the most unsavory gossip” into public places. Findings suggest that this type of cell phone usage in social spaces generates negative attitudes because it may disturb others nearby.&lt;ref&gt;http://php.scripts.psu.edu/users/o/o/oob100/127TOCOMMJ.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby individuals are forced to accept the information from the person on the phone, which is not simply overhearing. They tend to believe that the talker is sending a message to those nearby that he or she has claimed the individual use of the public space &lt;ref name=&quot;thenewatlantis&quot;&gt;Rosen C. (2004). Our Cell Phones, Ourselves. The New Atlantis. [http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/our-cell-phones-ourselves]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The deregulation of boundaries in the workplace is also evident. Cell phones provide a convenient way to communicate with people outside of work, undermining the established work-life boundary in most cultures. On the other hand, cell phones facilitate fluid communication and create more direct and private links between individuals in the work space. Institutional orders dependent on spatial isolation are more difficult to maintain because people can talk to other coworkers easily outside of the workplace &lt;ref name=&quot;Geser, 2006&quot;&gt;Geser, H. (2006). Is the cell phone undermining the social order?: Understanding mobile technology from a sociological perspective. Knowledge, Technology &amp; Policy, 19, 8-18. doi:10.1007/s12130-006-1010-x [http://www.springerlink.com/content/e72pgerbv6etkn7r/]&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Effects on Social Behaviors === 
Cell phones may also reduce interaction with strangers. One study shows that people who have cell phones are less likely to help strangers in need, possibly because they are less likely to observe the surroundings. They are also reluctant to show non-verbal social cues such as smiling, and unconsciously display more non-friendly behaviors &lt;ref name=&quot;psu&quot;&gt;Banjo, O., Hu, Y., &amp; Sundar, S. S. (2008). Cell phone usage and social interaction with proximate others: Ringing in a theoretical model. Open Communication Journal, 2, 127–135. [http://php.scripts.psu.edu/users/o/o/oob100/127TOCOMMJ.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;. Interaction with increasingly smart and interactive devices may disperse social responsibilities, causing alienation of communication at the social level.

Alternatively, certain mannerisms such as chin-cupping and back turning while on the phone are used to establish privacy boundaries in public areas. A study suggests that people who are alone in public tend to engage in activities such as being on the phone to legitimize being alone in public &lt;ref&gt;http://php.scripts.psu.edu/users/o/o/oob100/127TOCOMMJ.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. With the aid of cell phone, people are more reluctant to leave their comfort zone in public. These types of behaviors invite the presumption of privacy and make users appear inaccessible for social interaction.

Findings have also suggested that cell phones can be used as a form of self-exclusion in social spaces. Cell phone users have been reported to glance or gaze up from their phone (acknowledging the presence of strangers), yet according to their body language, show no intent of pursuing any type of interaction &lt;ref&gt;http://php.scripts.psu.edu/users/o/o/oob100/127TOCOMMJ.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. The easy accessibility of cell phones allows users the choice of opting out of social interactions with strangers.

=== Cell Phone Dependency ===
People may become dependent on cell phone use to maintain relationships. Individuals can become attached to using their cell phones to connect with others instead of communicating via face-to-face interactions. Replacing face-to-face interactions with cell phone could lead to the problem of &quot;friends on the wire&quot;. One person might feel close to another just because they chatted on the phone. However, they feel unease in a physical meeting due the prolonged lack of physical intimacy in the friendship. This is analogy to the idea of &quot;friends on Facebook only&quot;, where two persons interacts well on Facebook but found themselves unable to start a conversation in real life. People who are over dependent on phones cannot function well without cell phones in the social environment, including inability to remember names, and illusions that their phone is ringing. Cell phone dependency is especially evident in teenagers, who are developing their social cognitive abilities. A study with 624 young adults showed that excessive cellular phone use may cause leisure boredom, sensation seeking, lack of self-esteem and other addictive behaviors &lt;ref name=&quot;Leung, Konijn, Tanis, Utz, &amp; Linden, 2007&quot;&gt;Leung, L., Konijn, E. A., Tanis, M. A., Utz, S., &amp; Linden, A. (2007). Leisure boredom, sensation seeking, self-esteem, addiction symptoms and patterns of mobile phone use. Mediated Interpersonal Communication. Department of Communication Science, Free University Amseterdam. [http://www.com.cuhk.edu.hk/cuccr/en/pdf/mp9-CMC.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;. In response, many schools in the US have banned cell phone use during the school time &lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;&gt;SCHOOL BOOK. (2011). Time to Repeal the Cellphone Ban, Students Say. The New York Times. [http://www.nytimes.com/schoolbook/2011/11/02/time-to-repeal-the-cellphone-ban-students-say/]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Another form of cell phone dependency is when the majority of people in a social group use cell phones. A Japanese researcher pointed out that cell phone use is a way of life for teenagers; about 96% of 16-to-17-year-old students typically have cell phones on their person &lt;ref name=&quot;redorbit&quot;&gt;RedOrbit. (2009). Japanese Teens' Cell Phone Ues Out of Control. [http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/1645743/japanese_teens_cell_phone_use_out_of_control]&lt;/ref&gt;, and 24% of them claim not to interact with their peers who do not have a cell phone. A cell phone is essential to being part of the social group because of the prevalence of these devices, causing discrimination and cell-phone bullies  &lt;ref name=&quot;Fortunati, 2002&quot;&gt;Fortunati, L. (2002). The mobile phone: Towards new categories and social relations 1. Information, Communication &amp; Society, 5(4), 513–528.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;japantimes&quot;&gt;Nagata, K. (2009). Cell Phone Culture Here Unlike Any Other. The Japan Times Online. [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20090902i1.html]&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Text-messaging ===
People feel more comfortable [[wikipedia:Text messaging|text-messaging]] compared to talking to people face-to-face since it allows more time to deliberate. [[File:Texting.jpg|thumb|Texting on a [[wikipedia:QWERTY|QWERTY]] keyboard.]] Researchers claim that text-messaging confines the scope of social interactions. Most of the time, texters form small, close-knit groups, or “text circles,” consisting of relatively invariant members. Since text-messaging is intrinsically private, outsiders can hardly participate &lt;ref name=&quot;160characters&quot;&gt;Reid, D., &amp; Reid, F. (2004). Insights into the social and psychological effects of SMS text messaging. Text, 2005(February), 1–11. [http://www.160characters.org/documents/SocialEffectsOfTextMessaging.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition, text-messaging creates many abbreviations and non-standard grammar patterns that only certain groups of people can understand. As a consequence, text-messaging and cell phone use potentially hinder the communication between parents and their children, since patents can hardly observe and monitor the interests of their children expressed through their text-messages.

73% of Americans admitted to using text-messaging as a tool to maintain relationships &lt;ref&gt;http://www.intomobile.com/2011/09/20/american-and-text-messaging-3/&lt;/ref&gt;. However, with respect to a romantic relationship, participants in a study placed a higher importance on face to face communication and verbal communication and believed these to be richer forms of communication &lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/amanda-klein/texting-romantic-relationships_b_1821646.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Text-messaging was seen as a less significant form of communication and potential pitfalls include: misinterpretation, ambiguity, and false representation of one's true self &lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/amanda-klein/texting-romantic-relationships_b_1821646.html&lt;/ref&gt;. As compare to face-to-face interactions, text messaging lacks [[wikipedia:Prosody_(linguistics)|prosody]], an important feature in linguistics. Prosody includes the rhythm, stress and intonation of speech which are important to understand speaker's emotional states and presents of irony. Hence, in text messaging, users find it hard to understand one's true intention and emotion. Excess use of emotion phrases or icons such as the smiley face and &quot;lol&quot; further obfuscate the meaning of the text.

== Cell Phone Sub Culture == 
=== Social Norms, Cues, and Expectations===
Social components of face to face interaction have been transferred to the cell phone domain in the form of text-messaging norms, etiquette, and rules &lt;ref&gt;Top 10 list of SMS etiquette [http://www.wirelessdevnet.com/newswire-less/thefeature04.html]&lt;/ref&gt;. Social cues are normally based on facial expression during face to face communication, but the cell phone has replaced them with [[Wikipedia:Emoticon|emoticons]] and [[Wikipedia:Slang|slang]] words. Text-messaging [[Wikipedia:Jargon|jargon]] is an important part of belonging to the cell phone sub culture &lt;ref&gt;Texting Abbreviations, 2012[http://netforbeginners.about.com/od/internetglossary/tp/The-Top-Text-Message-Acronyms-of-2011.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;. The limit of characters per [[Wikipedia:Short Message Service|SMS]] text message forces a form of brevity in the structure of this social interaction. Acceptable [[Wikipedia:SMS Language|text abbreviations]], emoticons, and phrases have become a large part of understanding one another in such a limited context. For example, the phrase &quot;laugh out loud&quot; has been replaced with abbreviations such as &quot;[[Wikipedia:LOL|lol]]&quot;, which has become a trademark to expressing oneself in response to humor. Emoticons such as [[Wikipedia:Smiley|smiley faces]] have replaced social cues such as “facial expressions” that one would experience in a normal conversation. 

Cell phone etiquette matters when it comes to communication &lt;ref&gt;Cell Phone Etiquette: 15 Rules To Follow[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/26/cell-phone-etiquette-15-r_n_514927.html]&lt;/ref&gt;. Society dictates that you respond to emails, pick up phone calls, respond to voice mails, and reply to text messages since mobile devices are so readily available. Failing to be responsive can send mixed messages: it leaves the sender waiting for your reply, creates speculation of a sending error, or implies avoidance of the text at hand. Text messages have become a favored form of communication as they grant users complete control over what they want to say and requires less commitment. In fact, the number of text messages sent and received has grown from 14 billion in 2000 to 188 billion in 2010, and Americans ages 18-29 send and receive an average of nearly 88 text messages per day, compared to 17 phone calls &lt;ref&gt;We Never Talk Anymore: The Problem with Text Messaging[http://techland.time.com/2012/08/16/we-never-talk-anymore-the-problem-with-text-messaging/]&lt;/ref&gt;. However, text-messaging can be viewed as an informal way to communicate more complex matters such as planning an event, extending an apology, or maintaining a deeper relationship. Habitual text-messaging may not only cheat existing relationships, it may also limit the ability to form new ones since it doesn't incur the art of interpreting nonverbal visual cues &lt;ref&gt;We Never Talk Anymore: The Problem with Text Messaging[http://techland.time.com/2012/08/16/we-never-talk-anymore-the-problem-with-text-messaging/]&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Social Status===
Cell phones have become a form of social status. This is something that has been perpetuated by commercials, and advertising of the latest cell phones. Some people achieve status by being an [[Wikipedia:Early adopter|early adopter]] in the [[Wikipedia:Technology adoption life cycle|technology adoption life cycle]], waiting in lines for the newest phones with the latest capabilities. In addition, phone specifications have become an indicator of your phone quality: screen size, [[Wikipedia:Display resolution|display resolution]], weight, internet speed, [[Wikipedia: Signal strength|signal reception]], [[Wikipedia:Image resolution|camera resolution]], [[Wikipedia:Mobile app|cell phone applications]], and more. It has become an obsession to tout the newest phone, much like buying a brand new car. Cell phones have become expensive to buy without a contract renewal, yet people still break contract to have the newest model. People value reputation above cash, and for some, higher price tags mean more status points &lt;ref&gt;For the Brain, Cash Is Good, Status Is Better [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=for-the-brain-status-is-better]&lt;/ref&gt;. The cell phone is a highly visible accessory, which characterizes one's technological consumerism. Those who aren't satisfied with having the latest smart phone can even purchase personalized phone cases to set themselves apart &lt;ref&gt;Custom Cell Phone Case iPhone Cases[http://www.zazzle.com/custom+cell+phone+case+iphone+cases]&lt;/ref&gt;. The cell phone has become an object of individuality for people to achieve their desired status. 

Downloading the newest or most popular phone application provides additional status. The ability to do more with your phone is something promoted by cell phone companies, rewarded by peers, and readily available for the user to access through online market places such as [[Wikipedia:Google Play|Google Play]]. Having the most popular apps, the newest games, or the ability to find directions during a car ride immediately adds to one's reputation through their cell phone. Cell phone applications and [[Wikipedia:Media sharing|media sharing]] have become the most recent technological developments amongst competing cell phone companies &lt;ref&gt;http://epub.lib.aalto.fi/en/ethesis/pdf/12638/hse_ethesis_12638.pdf[http://epub.lib.aalto.fi/en/ethesis/pdf/12638/hse_ethesis_12638.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Social Groups ==
=== Social Groups in Favor of Cell Phone Use ===
There are many social groups support the use of cell phones for social interactions, including cell phone manufacturers, wireless service providers and agencies such as the [[wikipedia:ITU| ITU]](International Telecommunication Union), the UN agency for technology and communication, and the [[wikipedia:CTIA_–_The_Wireless_Association|CTIA]](Cellular Telecommunications Internet Association). 

Telecommunication companies, from service providers to cell phone manufacturers, advertise the social advantages of cell phones. These can be seen in cell phones advertisements. One of the world best known slogans is Nokia's &quot;Connecting People&quot; slogan invented by Ove Strandberg and it had been in use since 1992 &lt;ref&gt; Nokia Timeline [http://home.btconnect.com/randallwilkinson/media/pdfs/Nokia_Timeline.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;. [[File:Nokian logo.svg|thumb|Nokian logo]]

==== Social Media Integration ====
Modern cell phone advertisement stressed on the capability of content sharing and the ease of social interaction with friends. Cell phone ads showcase the importance of users staying up to date with social events and meeting up with friends and how having a cell phone helps &lt;ref name= &quot;at&amp;t taco ad&quot;&gt; Video: AT&amp;T Taco Ad. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoMkJ87uMBU]&lt;/ref&gt;. Nowadays, seamless integration to social media applications such as Facebook and Twitter is valued as the core phone functionality &lt;ref name=&quot;Pulse (2012)&quot;&gt;Pulse. (2012). How Social Networking Is Impacting Smartphones [pulse2.com/2012/10/10/how-social-networking-is-impacting-smartphones/]&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, Nokia Lumia 900 utilizes the &quot;Live Tiles&quot; system to show unread Facebook notifications update at a glance. The Samsung Galaxy S3 makes Facebook one of it's top shortcut priorities, allowing user to check latest statues updates from friends without even unlocking phone. Smartphone and social media became two concepts that are strongly linked together. A study has shown that 67% of smartphone customers downloaded social networking applications and spend more than 100 minutes per week using those applications &lt;ref name=&quot;J.D. Power and Associates, 2012&quot;&gt; J.D. Power and Associates. (2012). Social Networking and Gaming Applications Driving Smartphone Usage and Revenue [https://pictures.dealer.com/jdpower/9b9fa4aa0a0d02b701de152f6fa581cd.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt;. In fact, people spends more time using Facebook through mobile apps than on computers &lt;ref name=&quot;New York Times 2012&quot;&gt; Chen B. (2012). Facebook Reorients Itself for a Small-Screen World [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/24/technology/facebook-rewrites-its-code-for-a-small-screen-world.html?_r=0]&lt;/ref&gt;. On smartphone platform, many social gaming applications gained popularity, allowing players to interacts with their friends in game. Popular asynchronous social network games such as [[wikipedia:FarmVille|FarmVille ]] and [[wikipedia:Draw_something|Draw Something]] do not require players to play at the same time, thus enabling users to enjoy casual game with friends on their spare time. With social gaming, cell phone introduced a new way of interaction.

==== Virtual meeting ====
Cell phone could be used to stimulate face-to-face interactions using video conference technology such as Skype, Facetime, and Google+ Hangouts &lt;ref name=&quot;Facetime Ads&quot;&gt; Video: Facetime Ads [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKoLp_lGo14]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Hangout Ad&quot;&gt; Video: Google+: Just hanging out together [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo390-3ohW4] &lt;/ref&gt;. Many cell phones have built-in front-facing camera to support video calling. Such video conference technology introduced the idea of &quot;virtual meeting&quot;, allowing two people to virtually meet each other despite being in different physical locations. Virtual meeting is often used in workplace in conjunction to traditional live meeting. Virtual meeting sparked debate as to whether it replaces face-to-face meeting. Although virtual meeting allows user to see digital image of faces, it is hard to make actual eye contact due to the different locations of camera and screen. It might even provide the illusion that the other party is trying to avoid an eye contact. The lack of eye contact degrades user experience and hence the interaction made through a virtual meeting might not be as effective as a live meeting. The other psychological problem of meeting virtually is the consciousness that the video might be recorded. As compare to live meeting, user feels less privacy and security in virtual meeting and this changed how people interacts during video conference.

In addition to software technology, hardware of cell phones are constantly evolving to further embrace the idea of social connectivity. The Android Beam is an application of [[wikipedia:Near_field_communication|Near field communication]] technology in smartphone. It allows content transfer by a touch of two phones on the back. 

Sharing and connecting with friends is now easier than before with the aid of cell phones. Through advertisements and providing various social networking features in cell phone, advocates of cell phone argued that that cell phone will increase user's social interaction rather than reducing it.

=== Social Groups against Cell Phone Use ===
Most groups are against cell phone use for specific reasons. This sections will focus on social groups that against cell phone use in certain situations due to its disruption in the social context. 

==== Theaters ====
Many movie theaters have a “zero tolerance” cell phone rule against talking on the phone and texting during the screening, because the improper use of a cell phone is a top customer complaint in movie theaters &lt;ref name=&quot;fox2now&quot;&gt;Regnier C. (2011). Wehrenberg's New 'Zero Tolerance' Cell Phone Policy. Fox2Now. [http://www.fox2now.com/news/ktvi-wehrenberg-zero-tolerance-cell-phone-policy-081511,0,7918480.story]&lt;/ref&gt;. Theaters often show a short video before the actual movie to remind everyone about turning off their phone during screening &lt;ref&gt; Video: AMC Theater - Silence your cell phone short [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mgn5-o1Eeo]&lt;/ref&gt;. In New York City, cell phone in indoor theater, library, museum etc. are exhibited. The legislation was first proposed by theater owners &lt;ref&gt; New York City bans cell phones during public performances [http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/Northeast/04/13/broadway.cellphone.ban.reut/]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Restaurants ====
Some restaurants battle against the usage of cell phone while dining. Talking loudly on the phone or snapping photos in a restaurant could cause annoyance to other diners. Irritation over distracted dining increases further with the rise of photo sharing application like [[wikipedia:Instagram|Instagram]] and [[wikipedia:Pinterest|Pinterest]]. According to a Mobile Etiquette Survey in 2012, one in five adults share information online when eating a meal with others and a third of teens do the same &lt;ref&gt;Intel. (2012). Intel Annual 'Mobile Etiquette' Study Examines Online Sharing Behaviors Around the World; Global Perception of 'Oversharing' Revealed [http://newsroom.intel.com/community/intel_newsroom/blog/2012/09/05/intel-annual-mobile-etiquette-study-examines-online-sharing-behaviors-around-the-world-global-perception-of-oversharing-revealed]&lt;/ref&gt;. A New American restaurant in Los Angeles gave a 5% discount to diners who give up their cell phones in a basket at the front door &lt;ref&gt; Associate Press. (2012). Restaurant owners grapple with policies for annoying cell phone use [http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2012/10/19/restaurant-owners-grapple-with-policies-for-annyoning-cell-phone/#ixzz2EznRlhNn]&lt;/ref&gt;. Many other high-end restaurants have a sign that says cell phone use is prohibited. Some diners are supportive of the idea by playing the &quot;Phone Stacking&quot; game invented by Brian Perez to prevent meal-time interruption &lt;ref&gt;Mogg T. (2012). Phone Stack restaurant game prevents meal-time interruptions (and could cost you a lot of money) [http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/phone-stack-restaurant-game-prevents-meal-time-interruptions-and-could-cost-you-a-lot-of-money/]&lt;/ref&gt;. In the game, everyone stack their phones face down in the center of the table while dining and the first person who pick up his/her phone pays the bill.

==== Schools ====
Many schools in the US also ban the use of cell phones among students. A Survey has shown that 24% of K-12 schools ban cell phones in school and 62% ban cell phones in classroom in 2010 &lt;ref&gt;Lenhart, Ling, Campbell &amp; Purcell. (2010). Teens and Mobile Phones [http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Teens-and-Mobile-Phones/Summary-of-findings/Findings.aspx] &lt;/ref&gt;. Schools believe that cell phones may have negative impacts on the mental and social development of the students. However, teenagers treat text messaging as the primary method of communication rather than talking face-to-face. Thus, bans from school is not usually effective, 58% of cell-owning teens at schools that ban phones have sent a text during class &lt;ref&gt;Lenhart, Ling, Campbell &amp; Purcell. (2010). Teens and Mobile Phones [http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Teens-and-Mobile-Phones/Summary-of-findings/Findings.aspx] &lt;/ref&gt;. Parents, on the other hand, have a conflicting emotion towards teenager cell phone use. Parents wants to get in touch with their teens. However, cell phones often result in irritating interruptions in family gatherings. Cell phone could also possibly create a culture gap between older generations and the younger generations. Unrestricted cell phone use could lead to teenager [[w:Problem mobile phone use|cell phone overuse]]. Although cell phone helps strength the bonds between teenage peers, cell phone overuse is highly undesired by parents and also viewed as an unhealthy problem by the society.

It should also be pointed out that, because the cell phone has a high penetration rate in people's social life, individuals are becoming more willing to tolerate certain use of cellphones in the public. While mobile phones are typically banned in primary education settings, many educators and parents believe that cell phones may prepare children for crisis situations&lt;ref name=&quot;cmcs&quot;&gt;Katz, J. E. (2003). Mobile phones in educational settings. Origins, 91–103. [http://cmcs.rutgers.edu/publications/articles/mobile%20phones%20in%20educational%20settings.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;. According to the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, we may believe that cell phone may gain further popularity in changing people's social life.

==== Cell Phone and Driving ====
The most severe criticism of cell phone use is using cell phone while driving. Cell phone is a huge distraction to driver and thus potentially led to higher rate of accident. Experiment shown that texting while driving had a greater impact than driving drunk &lt;ref&gt; Lebeau P. (2009). Texting And Driving Worse Than Drinking and Driving [http://www.cnbc.com/id/31545004]&lt;/ref&gt;. Research shows that risk of a collision is 4 times higher with cell phone usage and hands-free cell phone units offers no advantage&lt;ref&gt; Redelmeier &amp; Tibshirani (1997) Association between Cellular-Telephone Calls and Motor Vehicle Collisions [http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199702133360701]&lt;/ref&gt;. Many social groups campaigned against cell phone usage while driving, such as [http://stoptextsstopwrecks.org/#home Stop Texts Stop Wrecks Org], [http://teensagainstdistracteddriving.com/ Teens Against Distracted Driving] and [http://www.att.com/gen/press-room?pid=2964 AT&amp;T's Texting Can Wait Campaign]. Currently, 10 states prohibit all drivers from using handheld cell phone while driving &lt;ref&gt; Cell Phone and Texting Laws [http://www.ghsa.org/html/stateinfo/laws/cellphone_laws.html] &lt;/ref&gt;. Some argued that having a phone conversation is similar to having a conversation with a passenger in the car. However, Cognitive Psychologist Goldstein pointed out that a friend on the phone behave differently than a passenger. A passenger will be more aware of traffic condition and would pause conversation upon upcoming hazards whereas a friend on the phone could not do that&lt;ref&gt; GoldStein (2008). Cognitive Psychology Third Edition&lt;/ref&gt;. He also argued that phone conversation is socially demanding and it is generally considered poor manner to suddenly stop talking or to pause for a long period.

== Conclusion ==

The full implications of cell phone use on face-to-face interaction are unclear. The effects of older technologies like the printing press and the radio were not fully understood until several years later, and this lag time can only be expected to take place for a technology as complex as the cell phone. The cell phone has as many groundbreaking characteristics as these other technologies and its effects have been varied, ranging from social isolation to increased social networks and face-to-face interaction. Many of the effects of cell phones on face-to-face interactions are dependent on the users &lt;ref&gt; Hartfield J. &amp; Harrison M. (2008). 
Symposium: Cell Phones- Modern convenience or social scourge? Prometheus. [http://theprometheusinstitute.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=215:symposium-cell-phones-modern-convenience-or-social-scourge&amp;catid=56:technologyandbusiness&amp;Itemid=46]&lt;/ref&gt;. However, users are often constrained by expectations and norms in the society. Society has implicit rules that dictate when one is expected to use a cell phone for social interactions and when one is not allowed to use a cell phone. One generalizable lesson is that technologies can be extremely negative or extremely positive, and these effects are dependent on the habits of the users themselves and the society norms.

== Fair use ==
Wikibooks can host fair use images locally, even if we use Commons as the default they will not host fair use images themselves.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 04:24, 27 December 2011 (UTC)

== Use of tutorials from RasterTek.com ==

Hey there! You've been making a lot of edits in one day, but you must be certain that Craig allowed you to copy the tutorials to Wikibooks and allowed you to do so under a free license, like the GFDL, CC-BY, or CC-BY-SA. If you don't verify this, then the pages you added will be deleted speedily.

* &lt;font size=3&gt;Previously administered as part of the French territory of Comoros, in 1975 it separated from Comoros and remained under French control when Comoros gained its independence. Although the United Nations in 1979 declared Mayotte to be under Comoros sovereignty, in all practical terms the island remained a French possession and in fact became a fully integrated department (province) of France in 2001. For stamps used in Mayotte before 1975, see COMOROS.

* Only one stamp type has been found that has “MAYOTTE” in the frank. All other stamps used since 1975 have frank dies indistinguishable from those of France. See [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/International_Postage_Meter_Stamp_Catalog/France France: Annex] for these issues.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
There are a number of scheme dealing with the detention and forfeiture of property in criminal law. There is a significant amount of overlap between many of them and so provide for several methods of forfeiting property.

* [[Canadian Criminal Sentencing/Proceeds of Crime]]
* [[Canadian Criminal Sentencing/Offence-related Property]]
* [[Canadian Criminal Sentencing/Offence-related Property Under the Controlled Drugs Substances Act]]

'''Application for disposition'''&lt;br&gt;
117.05 (1) Where any thing or document has been seized under subsection 117.04(1) or (2), the justice who issued the warrant authorizing the seizure or, if no warrant was issued, a justice who might otherwise have issued a warrant, shall, on application for an order for the disposition of the thing or document so seized made by a peace officer within thirty days after the date of execution of the warrant or of the seizure without a warrant, as the case may be, fix a date for the hearing of the application and direct that notice of the hearing be given to such persons or in such manner as the justice may specify.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Ex parte hearing'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) A justice may proceed ex parte to hear and determine an application made under subsection (1) in the absence of the person from whom the thing or document was seized in the same circumstances as those in which a summary conviction court may, under Part XXVII, proceed with a trial in the absence of the defendant.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Hearing of application'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) At the hearing of an application made under subsection (1), the justice shall hear all relevant evidence, including evidence respecting the value of the thing in respect of which the application was made.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Forfeiture and prohibition order on finding'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) Where, following the hearing of an application made under subsection (1), the justice finds that it is not desirable in the interests of the safety of the person from whom the thing was seized or of any other person that the person should possess any weapon, prohibited device, ammunition, prohibited ammunition and explosive substance, or any such thing, the justice shall
:(a) order that any thing seized be forfeited to Her Majesty or be otherwise disposed of; and
:(b) where the justice is satisfied that the circumstances warrant such an action, order that the possession by that person of any weapon, prohibited device, ammunition, prohibited ammunition and explosive substance, or of any such thing, be prohibited during any period, not exceeding five years, that is specified in the order, beginning on the making of the order.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Reasons'''&lt;br&gt;
(5) Where a justice does not make an order under subsection (4), or where a justice does make such an order but does not prohibit the possession of all of the things referred to in that subsection, the justice shall include in the record a statement of the justice’s reasons.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Application of ss. 113 to 117'''&lt;br&gt;
(6) Sections 113 to 117 apply in respect of every order made under subsection (4).
&lt;P&gt;
Appeal by person'''&lt;br&gt;
(7) Where a justice makes an order under subsection (4) in respect of a person, or in respect of any thing that was seized from a person, the person may appeal to the superior court against the order.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Appeal by Attorney General'''&lt;br&gt;
(8) Where a justice does not make a finding as described in subsection (4) following the hearing of an application under subsection (1), or makes the finding but does not make an order to the effect described in paragraph (4)(b), the Attorney General may appeal to the superior court against the failure to make the finding or to make an order to the effect so described.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Application of Part XXVII to appeals'''&lt;Br&gt;
(9) The provisions of Part XXVII, except sections 785 to 812, 816 to 819 and 829 to 838, apply in respect of an appeal made under subsection (7) or (8) with such modifications as the circumstances require and as if each reference in that Part to the appeal court were a reference to the superior court.

In order to succeed in an application for a forfeiture order, the applicant must prove:&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Robinson, [http://canlii.ca/t/2fk2r 2011 CanLII 3758] (NL PC) at para 7&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
# the respondent is the owner of the item to be forfeited
# the respondent did not have reasonable grounds to believe that the item forfeited would or might be used in the commission of the offence.

==Forfeiture of Property on Computer-related Convictions==
Section 164.2 allows for the Crown to seek forfeiture of computer equipment on conviction for [[Canadian Criminal Sentencing/Offences/Child Pornography|child pornography]] (s.162.1) or [[Canadian Criminal Sentencing/Offences/Child Luring|child luring]] (172.1).

{{quotation|
'''Forfeiture after conviction'''&lt;br&gt;
164.2 (1) On application of the Attorney General, a court that convicts a person of an offence under section 163.1, 172.1 or 172.2, in addition to any other punishment that it may impose, may order that anything — other than real property — be forfeited to Her Majesty and disposed of as the Attorney General directs if it is satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the thing
:(a) was used in the commission of the offence; and
:(b) is the property of
::(i) the convicted person or another person who was a party to the offence, or
::(ii) a person who acquired the thing from a person referred to in subparagraph (i) under circumstances that give rise to a reasonable inference that it was transferred for the purpose of avoiding forfeiture.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Third party rights'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Before making an order under subsection (1), the court shall cause notice to be given to, and may hear, any person whom it considers to have an interest in the thing, and may declare the nature and extent of the person’s interest in it.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Right of appeal — third party'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) A person who was heard in response to a notice given under subsection (2) may appeal to the court of appeal against an order made under subsection (1).
&lt;P&gt;
'''Right of appeal — Attorney General'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) The Attorney General may appeal to the court of appeal against the refusal of a court to make an order under subsection (1).
&lt;P&gt;
'''Application of Part XXI'''&lt;br&gt;
(5) Part XXI applies, with any modifications that the circumstances require, with respect to the procedure for an appeal under subsections (3) and (4).
&lt;P&gt;
2002, c. 13, s. 7; 2008, c. 18, s. 4; 2012, c. 1, s. 18.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Definition=
The zero-price effect is an observed theory that decisions about free (zero price) products differ, in that people do not simply subtract costs from benefits but instead they perceive the benefits associated with free products as higher&lt;ref&gt;Shampanier, Kristina, Nina Mazar, and Dan Ariely. &quot;Zero as a Special Price: The True Value of Free Products.&quot; Marketing Science. 26.6 (2007): 742-757. Print. &lt;/ref&gt;. The effect of zero price can be characterized by the tendency to regard zero as behaving as a “special” price &lt;ref name=Shampanier /&gt;  resulting in overreaction to a free product as if zero price meant increased value&lt;ref name=Shampanier&gt;Shampanier, Kristina and Dan Ariely. “How Small is Zero Price? The True Value of Free Products”. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. 2006: 1-55. Accessed 31 October 2011 from &lt;http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/wp/wp2006/wp0616.htm &gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the effect on demand where ”free has the effect of bending the demand curve – demand shoots up in a very non-linear fashion”&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;Anderson, Chris. Free: The Future of a Radical Price. New York: Hyperion, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=Supporting Research=



'''EXPERIMENT ONE''':&lt;ref name=Shampanier /&gt;

Given an experimental situation, the nature of response to price changes involving zero price and positive prices was conducted. The experiment involved 60 participants who were given the choice to purchase a Hersheys bar (the low-value good), a Ferrero Rocher chocolate (the high-value good) or to buy nothing.  


Three different pricing conditions were tested; two of which prices for both goods were positive were called cost conditions, and those in which the price for one good was zero were called free conditions. The two variations which featured cost conditions involved Hersheys cost 1 cent and the Ferrero cost 26 cents, and In the second cost condition, Hersheys cost 2 cents and Ferrero cost 27 cents. The free condition tested featured the Hersheys bar was free and the Ferrero was priced at 25 cents.


Results of the experiment revealed that when prices changed from the initial 2&amp;27 cost condition to the 1&amp;26 cost condition, the change in demand for both products was negligible. In contrast, when prices dropped from 1&amp;26 to 0&amp;25, there was a substantial increase in the demand for Hersheys and a large decrease in the demand for Ferrero chocolate suggesting that the inclusion of the price of Hersheys as zero increased demand for Hersheys over Ferrero despite the relative value of the products.


Traditional economic theory argues that people subtract costs from benefits when making an economic decision and choose the outcome with the highest level of utility. According to this argument, zero should be treated just like any other price. However, the results of this experiment indicate that zero is NOT just another price. In fact, the results support the existence of a zero price effect. 



'''EXPERIMENT TWO:'''&lt;ref name=Shampanier /&gt;

In order to test the strength of the zero price effect, participants were provided with choices that involved larger incentives to not choose the product with price zero. 398 participants took place in this experiment. Each individual was given the choice to purchase a low value product (Hersheys), a high value product (a Lindt truffle), or nothing. Pricing conditions for this experiment were as follows : In condition one, Hersheys cost 1 cent and the truffle cost 15 cents, in condition two Hersheys were free and the truffle cost 14 cents, and in the last condition Hersheys were free and the truffle cost 10 cents.  The purpose of having the last free condition was to investigate how drastic price reductions for the high-value product effected demand for the free low-value product.


As the price dropped from the 1&amp;15 condition to the 0&amp;14 condition, demand for Hersheys chocolate increased dramatically, while demand for the Lindt truffles decreased substantially, again exhibiting evidence to support the zero price effect. There was no significant demand change between the two free conditions (0&amp;14 and 0&amp;10) despite the lowered price of the truffles. ”The reduction of a price to zero is more powerful than a five-times larger price reduction that remains within the range of positive prices”&lt;ref name=Shampanier /&gt;. The difference between the cost and free conditions is quite significant, but the difference between the two free conditions is insignificant&lt;ref name=Shampanier /&gt;.

=Possible Explanations/Causes= 

'''Social Norms'''

Social norms may be attributed to somehow creating a higher perceived value for the product whose price is zero. There have been several studies performed that suggest that the presence or lack of prices in a market invokes different decision-making patterns in individuals. Situations which involve prices invoke “market exchange norms” while an absence of prices (free) invokes “norms of social exchange” &lt;ref name=Shampanier /&gt;


'''Affect'''

Affect, being how individuals perceive decisions involving costs and benefits, is seen as a possible explaination/cause of the zero price effect. Theory  states that consumption options that have only benefits create a higher affective response when compared to options that involve both benefits and costs. Shampaner and Ariely argue that the decision to take a Hersheys chocolate for free involves no explicit costs - one does not actually have to pay for the chocolate - and so a higher affective response is achieved. This is in contrast to the truffles, where, although the benefits of consuming a Lindt truffle are presumably higher (it is the higher-value product), the costs are also higher as well, and the mental transactions involved with weighing the costs and benefits cause the consumer to simply choose the free product. Situations which involve prices invoke “market exchange norms” while an absence of prices (free) invokes “norms of social exchange” &lt;ref name=Shampanier /&gt;

=Applications=

&lt;u&gt;Section Description&lt;/u&gt;

*The purpose of this section of the article would be to provide examples of how businesses and countries have used the zero price effect to elicit desired behavior from a population.

&lt;u&gt;Quotes/Ideas to Include&lt;/u&gt;

'''Google'''&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt;

*Google is an example of a company that has thrived off of “free”
*Google is a 20 million dollar company that gives that majority of its products (Gmail, Google Docs, spreadsheets, etc) away for free. How can it do this?
*Google makes the majority of its profits off of advertising, so it can afford to give away products for free in order to make its products available to a large number of individuals with the hope that they will eventually purchase software from the company.

'''Jell-O'''&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt;

*When pre-packaged powdered gelatin was first produced by Peter Cooper in the late 1800s, Cooper had a difficult time selling his invention. Eventually, Cooper became so frustrated with the failed product that he sold the rights to a man by the name of Pearle Wait. Wait spent a great deal of his time and money attempting to market the packaged gelatin, with little success. Eventually Wait gave up as well and sold the rights to Frank Woodward in 1899. Woodward and his marketing chief William Humelbaugh realized that Jell-O was not selling because consumers didn’t understand the product and its benefits. In an effort to change this, Woodward distributed free cookbooks to housewives around the country - free cookbooks filled with recipes involving Jell-O. Due to Woodward’s genius marketing strategy, Jell-O would eventually become a household staple. 

'''Congestion in Singapore'''&lt;ref&gt;Lew, Yii Der and Wai Yan Leong. “Managing Congestion in Singapore - A Behavioral Economics Perspective”. Journeys. May 2009. Accessed 31 October 2011 from &lt;http://www.ltaacademy.gov.sg/doc/IS02-p15%20Behavioural%20Economics.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

*In the mid 1970s, the government of Singapore introduced a program known as the Area Licensing Scheme in an attempt to solve the traffic congestion problem that was developing 
*Under the ALS, drivers were forced to purchase special licenses to enter heavy-traffic zones during peak hours. In addition to these fees, drivers parking prices in the Central Business District were also increased. Finally, in order to encourage alternative forms of transportation, significant improvements were made to the country’s bus system.
*As predicted, visits to high-traffic zones during peak hours dropped, and usage of the bus system increased as individuals substituted away from driving. 
*Implementation of the ALS had another interesting effect on the behavior of Singapore’s residents. Despite the fact that citizens were typically averse to sharing their vehicle with others, individuals began driving complete strangers to high-traffic zones. The reason behind this reaction was that carpools were exempt from the fees associated with the ALS. Thus the residents of Singapore were heavily influenced by both the raise in transportation prices and the existence of a zero price associated with carpooling.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Engine - 3 cylinder diesel (TY395)==

     See [[Chinese Tractor Maintenance/TY395]]

==Hydraulic System==

===Specifications===

* Gear pump – 6.6 gpm
* Pump fitting – M14 x 1.5 ORFS (O-ring flat surface)
* Pressure relief valve set @ 2230 psi
* Refill capacity – 6.8 gal
* Cylinder fittings – M18 x 1.5 ORFS (O-ring flat surface)

===Maintenance===

Use ISO AW32 hydraulic oil (non-foaming)
or ISO AW 32/46/68 multi-grade hydraulic oil.

===Troubleshooting===

===Modifications===

Phil added a 10 micron filter in the hydraulic return line.

Phil added a copper disk (0.64” OD and 0.04” thick with 1/16” hole in center) to each tilt cylinder port to smooth blade tilting action.  

==Electrical System==

===Specifications===

12 volt, 200 watt alternator

===Troubleshooting===

===Modifications===

Phil added T fitting with VW low pressure switch to the oil pressure gauge line. Switch is normally closed which lights a red lamp and sounds a buzzer when oil pressure is low. Tubing is 1/4” and pressure switch is 1/8” pipe thread.

Rich replaced his OEM alternator with a Delco 10Si three wire alternator. The OEM pulley fit the Delco 10Si but he had to make a new adjustment bracket. Rich also replaced the OEM belt with a link-belt from Harbor Freight. More power and a rebuilt Delco 10Si is cheaper than an OEM replacement alternator.

Bob replaced his OEM alternator with a Delco 12Si, 72 amp alternator. He put the lock washer between the OEM pulley and the fan as a spacer and used a couple of washers on the adjustment arm. Only additional purchases were a pigtail for $2.50 US and a link-belt, to replace the OEM belt, from Harbor Freight.

==Fuel System==

===Maintenance===

Need to treat diesel with a biocide to kill the bugs and add a lubricant such as Power Serve because of the new low sulfur diesel.

===Troubleshooting===

===Modifications===

Phil removed screen on top of sediment bowl and in bottom banjo bolt of primer pump. Installed a Racor 25 series pre-filter (025-RAC-02). Filter can be easily seen, cleaned and removes 99% of the water.  Copper tubing is 5/16”.

==Main Clutch==

===Manual===

====Specifications====

Single plate 10&quot; dry disk diaphragm spring.

====Operation====

Do NOT ride the pedal during dozer operation.

====Maintenance====

Clutch is adjusted by the pedal linkage

====Troubleshooting====

Leon's method for checking clutch.
* 1) Select a very slight incline where the dozer will creep backwards when clutch is depressed.
* 2) Prepare anything that can be used to measure the clutch position at a glance such as 1” tape on a 2x4 with 1” gaps.
* 3) With the dozer in first gear and the throttle as low as it will go, gently let out the clutch noting the clutch position on the forward movement and change in engine sound.
* 4) While moving forward, depress the clutch slowly until forward movement stops but before dozer starts to move backward noting the clutch position.
* 5) Repeat two more times and adjust pedal linkage as necessary.

====Modifications====

Leon replaced his clutch with a multi leafed soft clutch and solid plate.

===Hydraulic===

====Specifications====

====Operation====

====Maintenance====

====Troubleshooting====

====Modifications====

==Steering Clutch and Brakes==

===Specifications===

Steering clutch is a multiple dry cerametallic disk clutch.

===Operation===

Do NOT ride the pedals during dozer operation.

===Maintenance===
New segmented brake bands can be removed/replaced from the top without removing the final drive. Brake cam shaft must be removed first before the anchor pins and care taken to not contaminate the casting. If the brake bands to be removed are not segmented,one anchor end must be cut off to remove brake band.

===Troubleshooting===

===Modifications===



==Transmission==

===Specifications===
One mainshaft, one countershaft, non-synchronous, sliding spur gear.
Four speeds forward, one reverse.
High and low range yields 8 forward &amp; 2 reverse speeds.

===Maintenance===

Use non-foaming gear oil which is safe for yellow metal such as 80W90.

===Troubleshooting===

===Modifications===

==Final Drive==

===Maintenance===

Use non-foaming gear oil 85w-140.

===Modifications===

==Hydraulic Lifter and PTO==

===Specifications===

* Lifting capacity @ hitch point – 1650 lbs
* PTO shaft – 1 3/8” diameter with 6 splines
* 540 rpm @ 1812 engine rpm
* 1,000 rpm @ 1772 engine rpm
The high speed setting needs to be verified since 1,000 r/m PTO shafts have 21 splines.
It is believed that the high speed in this case is 720 r/m.

===Operation===

If arms are lifted too high, it is possible that the ram can come out of the cylinder.

===Maintenance===

===Troubleshooting===

===Modifications===

==Track and Undercarriage==

===Specifications===

Dozer with rubber tracks have one additional carrier roller per side.
Some newer models will have two top carrier rollers per side (steel and rubber tracks).

===Maintenance===

Do not forget to grease fitting on the front trunnion of the swing frame equalizer. To get to this fitting you will have to block dozer or drive it up on something like rail ties. Be sure to block blade.

===Troubleshooting===

===Modifications===

==Seat and Frame==

===Modifications===

Phil used jam nuts on bottom “oil level access screen” bolts and slotted screen to fit over these bolts. Used two mini toggle clamps to hold top of screen for easy removal and checking oil level.

==Blocking Dozer==

* Front - Under each side of swing frame equalizer.
* Rear -  Under each final drive housing.
* Blade – Block blade so it is not hanging against the lift cylinders.
* Note: If you plan to run dozer, be sure to have track clearance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Fold arrows''' – Supplementing the code folding support in the last beta, there are now buttons in the gutter to collapse text using the mouse. By default, the fold buttons will fade from view unless the mouse is over the gutter, however this is configurable using the fade_fold_buttons file setting. The fold buttons, and the space reserved for them in the gutter, can be removed with the fold_buttons file setting.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This template attempts to include this allbooks category in one of its parents.
=== Usage ===
: &lt;code&gt;{{((}}Allbooks category/parent{{!}}parent=&lt;/code&gt;&amp;lt;parent&amp;gt;&lt;code&gt;{{!}}subject=&lt;/code&gt;&amp;lt;subject&amp;gt;&lt;code&gt;{{))}}&lt;/code&gt;
where &amp;lt;subject&amp;gt; is the name of the subject page associated with this allbooks category (thus, {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Subject:&lt;/code&gt;&amp;lt;subject&amp;gt;}}), and &amp;lt;parent&amp;gt; is a parent name ''provided by that subject page'' (thus, it is the value of a parameter {{((}}{{parent}{{))}} or {{((}}{parent2}{{))}} passed to a call to {{tl|Subject page}} on page {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Subject:&lt;/code&gt;&amp;lt;subject&amp;gt;}}).

This template then checks that the parent subject page exists {{nowrap|(&lt;code&gt;Subject:&lt;/code&gt;&amp;lt;parent&amp;gt;)}} and is correctly formatted for automatic extraction of parameter values, and that its associated allbooks category exists; if not, it calls {{nowrap|{{tl|Allbooks category/error}}}}.  If all is well, it adds this allbooks category to the parent's allbooks category.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This template implements the final phase of internal processing for template {{tl|Allbooks category}}.  On entry here, we already know the subject page exists and is correctly formatted for extraction of its parameters.
=== Usage ===
There are three parameters, assumed to be specified (even if blank).
* {{((}}{parent}{{))}} &amp;mdash; the name of a parent subject, or blank.
* {{((}}{parent2}{{))}} &amp;mdash; the name of a parent subject, or blank.
* {{((}}{subject}{{))}} &amp;mdash; the name of the subject associated with this allbooks category; just the name of this category without the {{nowrap|&quot;/all books&quot;}} suffix.
This template attempts to add this allbooks category to the allbooks categories associated with the parent subjects, via {{nowrap|{{tl|Allbooks category/parent}}}}, and provides a notice that this allbooks category should be populated automatically.

&lt;br&gt;
==Annotations==
'''ULYSSES'''{{spaces|5}}''Ulysses'' derives from the Latin ''[[wikt:Ulysses|Ulyssēs]]'', a frequent error for ''Ulixēs'', influenced by the Ancient Greek ''Ὀδυσσεύς'' (''Odysseus''). Ulixēs was the name by which the Romans knew Odysseus, the hero of the Homeric epic the ''Odyssey''. As a fine Latinist but a comparatively poor [[wikt:Hellenist|Hellenist]], Joyce would have been more familiar with the hero as Ulysses than Odysseus. ''Ulysses'' is the form used in most of the standard English translations (e.g. [[w:George Chapman|George Chapman]], [[w:John Dryden|John Dryden]], [[w:Alexander Pope|Alexander Pope]], [[w:Samuel Butler|Samuel Butler]]). Joyce was also familiar from a young age with [[w:Charles Lamb|Charles Lamb's]] ''The Adventures of Ulysses''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=James Joyce |last=Ellmann |first=Richard |year=1982 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, when Joyce was in his third year at Belvedere College, he chose Ulysses as his subject for an essay entitled &quot;My Favourite Hero&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=James Joyce |last=Gorman |first=Herbert Sherman |year=1939 |publisher=Farrar &amp; Rinehart |location=New York |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In English ''Ulysses'' is sometimes stressed on the second syllable, and this is the pronunciation required in most verse translations of the Homeric epics. Joyce, however, always referred to his novel as YOOL-i-seez, with the stress on the first syllable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation needed}}&lt;br&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms_c_IaXR4k Sylvia Beach] pronounces it thus in this interview she gave in the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt; This pronunciation is sanctioned by the Oxford English Dictionary and is used almost universally in Ireland when one is referring to the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |title=Ulysses |edition=Second Edition|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his design for the cover of the 1949 [[w:Random House|Random House]] edition of ''Ulysses'', the American artist [[w:Edward McKnight Kauffer|Edward McKnight Kauffer]] emphasized the initial '''UL''', &quot;giving graphic form to the phonetic structure of the title with its accent on the first syllable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=By Its Cover: Modern American Book Cover Design |last1=Drew |first1=Ned |last2=Sternberger |first2=Paul Spencer |year=2005 |publisher=Princeton Architectural Press |location=New York |pages=11-12 |url=http://books.google.ie/books?id=_GkNcgf-DxcC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Irish/Pronunciation|Irish language]] most polysyllabic words are stressed on the first syllable, and this trait often carries over into our pronunciation of non-Irish words (''garage'', ''debris'', ''Godot'', ''Bernard Shaw'', etc).


'''SHAKESPEARE AND COMPANY'''{{spaces|5}} [[w:Shakespeare_and_Company_(bookstore)|Shakespeare and Company]] was a bookstore founded by an American expatriate [[w:Sylvia Beach|Sylvia Beach]] in Paris. It originally opened at 8 Rue Depuytren on 17 November 1919 before moving to larger premises at 12 Rue de l'Odéon in 1922. Joyce first met Beach at a literary soirée at the poet [[w:André Spire|André Spire's]] house at [[W:Neuilly-sur-Seine|Neuilly-sur-Seine]] on 11 July 1920.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms_c_IaXR4k Sylvia Beach Parle de James Joyce.] Fittingly, Beach first approached Joyce in Spire's library.&lt;/ref&gt; The following day Joyce visited her bookshop and the two became fast friends. Sylvia Beach went on to publish ''Ulysses'' on 2 February 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=James Joyce |last=Ellmann |first=Richard |year=1982 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |pages=488-489}}&lt;/ref&gt;


'''Rue de l'Odéon'''{{spaces|5}}The [[w:Rue de l'Odéon|Rue de l'Odéon]] is a street in the [[w:Odéon|Odéon]] quarter of the [[w:6th arrondissement of Paris|6th arrondissement of Paris]] on the [[w:Rive Gauche (Paris)|Left Bank]]. The French poet [[w:Adrienne Monnier|Adrienne Monier's]] bookshop, ''La Maison des amis des livres'', was located at No. 7. In 1922 her lover Sylvia Beach moved her bookshop, Shakespeare and Company, to No. 12. On his second visit to Paris in early 1903, Joyce regularly dined at a café in the nearby Carrefour de l'Odéon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=James Joyce |last=Gorman |first=Herbert Sherman |year=1939 |publisher=Farrar &amp; Rinehart |location=New York |page=100}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite book |title=James Joyce |last=Ellmann |first=Richard |year=1982 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This template implements the initial phase of internal processing for template {{tl|Allbooks category}}.  On entry here, all that is known is the expected name for the subject page associated with the allbooks category.
=== Usage ===
There is one parameter, assumed to be specified and non-blank.
* {{((}}{subject}{{))}} &amp;mdash; the name expected for the associated subject page.  This is just the name of the allbooks category without the &quot;/all books&quot; suffix.
This template checks that the subject page exists and is correctly formatted for extracting its parameters; if not, it calls {{nowrap|{{tl|Allbooks category/error}}}}.  If all is well, extracts the parameters from the subject page and calls {{nowrap|{{tl|Allbooks category/core2}}}}.
&lt;includeonly&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:OpenGL Tutorial Object Selection.png|thumb|Object selection using the mouse]]

= Introduction =

For some applications it is important to be able to select objects on the screen with a click of the mouse.
If you have a complex 3D scene with a non trivial projection (such as a perspective projection),
it can be very hard to figure out which object you clicked on based only on the mouse pointer x and y coordinates.
Fortunately, OpenGL has some features that make this a lot easier.
We will look at two valuable techniques; the first is finding out the coordinates in our object space from the mouse coordinates and depth buffer information,
the second is uniquely tagging every pixel using the stencil buffer so that we can figure out to which object it belongs.

= Reading back information from the framebuffer =

For both techniques, we will need to read back information from the framebuffer after we have drawn our 3D scene.
We do not need to read back the whole framebuffer, we just want to know what is at the pixel on which we clicked with the mouse.
We can register a callback with GLUT to get the mouse position whenever you click,
and use the &lt;code&gt;glReadPixels()&lt;/code&gt; function to find out what is at that pixel.
To register the callback, use:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
glutMouseFunc(onMouse);
&lt;/source&gt;

The callback looks like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
void onMouse(int button, int state, int x, int y) {
  if(state != GLUT_DOWN)
    return;

  window_width = glutGet(GLUT_WINDOW_WIDTH);
  window_height = glutGet(GLUT_WINDOW_HEIGHT);

  GLbyte color[4];
  GLfloat depth;
  GLuint index;
  
  glReadPixels(x, window_height - y - 1, 1, 1, GL_RGBA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, color);
  glReadPixels(x, window_height - y - 1, 1, 1, GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT, GL_FLOAT, &amp;depth);
  glReadPixels(x, window_height - y - 1, 1, 1, GL_STENCIL_INDEX, GL_UNSIGNED_INT, &amp;index);

  printf(&quot;Clicked on pixel %d, %d, color %02hhx%02hhx%02hhx%02hhx, depth %f, stencil index %u\n&quot;,
         x, y, color[0], color[1], color[2], color[3], depth, index);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;glReadPixels()&lt;/code&gt; function is quite straightforward.
The first two parameters are the x and y offset in pixels, but OpenGL has y coordinates reversed compared to GLUT.
The third and fourth parameter are the width and height of the region we are interested in.
Since we only want one pixel, we specify a 1 by 1 region.
Next is which component of the framebuffer we want to read.
GL_RGBA reads the full color information, GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT reads the value of the depth buffer, and GL_STENCIL_INDEX the value of the stencil buffer.
The sixth parameter is the format we want the data in.
Note that for OpenGL ES 2.0, there may be restrictions which formats you can select for each type of information, depending on the hardware and driver capabilities of your graphics card.
Last is the pointer to the variable or array we want to store the data in.

Of course, you will only get sensible depth or stencil information if you have the depth and stencil buffers enabled.
The values you get for the color and stencil index are what you would expect.
However, the depth value might be hard to interpret, although you will clearly see that for objects that are nearer to the camera, the depth value is smaller.
The depth value will always be between 0 and 1, and by default the background will have a depth value of 1.

Exercises
* Modify the [[OpenGL_Programming/Modern_OpenGL_Tutorial_06|textured cube tutorial]] to read the color, depth and stencil buffer information when you click in the window.

= Unprojecting window coordinates =

The mouse pointer x and y coordinates and the depth buffer z value are in so-called window coordinates, but are mostly useless.
What we want is to convert them back to object space coordinates, which is the coordinate system we used to specify our vertex coordinates in.
To do this, we need to apply the inverse of the transformation matrix to the window coordinates.
The GLM library conveniently has a function for us that does exactly what we want: &lt;code&gt;glm::unProject()&lt;/code&gt;.
This is how it is used, given the view and projection matrices you used to display the scene:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  glm::vec4 viewport = glm::vec4(0, 0, window_width, window_height);
  glm::vec3 wincoord = glm::vec3(x, window_height - y - 1, depth);
  glm::vec3 objcoord = glm::unProject(wincoord, view, projection, viewport);

  printf(&quot;Coordinates in object space: %f, %f, %f\n&quot;,
         objcoord.x, objcoord.y, objcoord.z);
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that if the depth value is 1, the coordinates will not really make sense, so you should check for that.
Now that we know the object space coordinates, we can try to find out which object is closest to those coordinates.
An easy technique is to loop through all the objects, and check the distance of the center of each object to those coordinates.
This might not give exact matches though, especially if the objects have complex shapes.
If the objects are on a regular grid, you can easily convert from object coordinates to grid coordinates.
If you use an octree or BSP to store your geometry, you can traverse those data structures to quickly find where you clicked.
However, if you want to know exactly which object is at the pixel you clicked, and the above methods are not good enough,
then you can try the stencil buffer technique described in the next section.

Exercises:
* You usually apply a model-view-projection matrix to the objects your draw. Why should you not include the model matrix in your unProjection?
* Suppose you wrote a 2D game with an isometric projection, and you can draw your screen from bottom to top without using the depth buffer. Can you still use &lt;code&gt;glm::unProject()&lt;/code&gt; with just the x and y coordinates?
* Change the textured cube tutorial to render at least 10 smaller cubes. When clicking on the window, find out which cube's center is closest to the point you clicked.

= Using the stencil buffer to identify objects =

If you're not using the stencil buffer for anything else,
you can use this to hold information about the objects on screen.
Similar to how we would draw a color in the color buffer, we can draw a number in the stencil buffer.
First, make sure you add &lt;code&gt;GLUT_STENCIL&lt;/code&gt; to your call to &lt;code&gt;glutInitDisplayMode()&lt;/code&gt;.
Then, assuming we are drawing ten objects, we can draw each object's number to the stencil buffer this way:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
void onDisplay() {
  glClearColor(...);
  glClearStencil(0); // this is the default value
  glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT|GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT|GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT);

  /* Any other initialization goes here */
  ...

  /* Enable stencil operations */
  glEnable(GL_STENCIL_TEST);
  glStencilOp(GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP, GL_REPLACE);

  for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
    glStencilFunc(GL_ALWAYS, i + 1, -1);
    draw_object(i);
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

First, we clear the whole framebuffer, and ensure the stencil buffer contains only zeros.
Next, we need to enable the stencil test, otherwise nothing will happen.
We use &lt;code&gt;glStencilOp(GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP, GL_REPLACE)&lt;/code&gt; to ensure the stencil buffer will be written to whenever the color buffer is written to (in particular, only when the depth test succeeds),
and we will replace the existing value with a fixed new value.
Then, right before drawing the object itself, we set the stencil function to always pass the stencil test, and the reference value to &lt;code&gt;i + 1&lt;/code&gt; (because 0 is already used for the background).
We set the mask to have all bits enabled (you can also use &lt;code&gt;~0&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;0xff&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt; if you prefer).
When reading back from the stencil buffer, you know you clicked on the background when you read a zero, otherwise you clicked on an object. Don't forget to subtract 1 when necessary.

Exercises
* Modify the textured cube example to write to the stencil buffer. Make it so you can highlight cubes when you click on them.

= More techniques =

The two techniques above are simple and fast, but might not be good enough for you.
Although the stencil buffer technique is the most accurate one, almost all graphics card only support an 8-bits stencil buffer.
That means you can only have up to 255 objects uniquely identified.
If you need more than 255 objects are already using the stencil buffer for something else,
consider using one of these alternatives:

* Combining information from both the stencil buffer, color buffer, and object coordinates might give you a unique solution.
* Draw the scene multiple times, using &lt;code&gt;glScissor()&lt;/code&gt; to render only the pixel you are interested in. In every pass, you can get 8 bits of information from the stencil buffer, so 3 passes allows you to uniquely identify 16 million objects.
* Draw the scene a second time, but instead of using the stencil buffer, give each object a unique solid color. This will give you a 24 or even 32 bits number for every pixel. Make sure you disable anti-aliasing though.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Does God exist?

Let us analyze this question by starting with literal aspects of the question first. The fact that we capitalize the first letter 'G', there is a definite inherent acceptance that we are talking about someone or something, that stands apart from the rest of us, or at least from the one who is posing this question or from the one who is expectantly holding the breath for an answer! Secondly why, when and how does this question even arise in one's mind and why is it even important to raise this question or understand the answer. And lastly who is putting this question to whom and of course ultimately, whom is this question about.

A myriad variety of religions got spun around this question and its answer for time immemorial. Each one has an opinion, some of them unique, some may gel well with others and some totally antagonistic to others. Which one is true? Answering this question is probably more inflammatory and more difficult than the original question we started out with. So we would not go there. But if we try to answer the original question, these secondary and probably irrelevant questions just fall apart.

Let us take the word, 'exists or not' aspect. Here there is a paramount expectation that someone or something whom we call God, to exist, the word 'exist' being used in the sense of common understanding of the word, i.e., 'a road is', or 'a telephone is' etc. In so doing, He, who we think to be God as 'existing', we bring Him into the realm of our experience. This reduces experience of existence totally to the level of mind, since we are either conceptualizing God by ourselves, or assimilating or rather accepting what others may preach of Him. This does serve the purpose to some extent. But such a god is no God, since he totally and absolutely depends on the mercy of the strength of your commitments, beliefs and faiths! Be it in what you conceptualized yourself or assimilated/accepted from others. After all, here the objective is to think there is some Power called God that ordains everything. However as I said earlier, this concept depends totally on the strength of your belief. Suppose you start out with such belief, it might withstand quite a few knocks on the head. Whenever we hit some head bumps, we might be able to accept them since we ''think'' that God has ordained them for me. But such faith and its strength has limits. There do come such big bangs in life that do knock even the senses out of us! And such events even knock the so called 'God-ordains' belief to winds! Instead of accepting the happenings as ordinances from God that we thought we accepted them to be, we start attributing them to others, such and such person, thing, circumstance or what not caused the trouble. Thus foster resistance and animosity. There goes your peace and your god along with it! And when things come more positively to us, we never fail to appropriate the success to ourselves, leaving nothing to God to ordain! If the belief that &quot;everything is ordained by God&quot; is unquestionably rooted in you, then one would be immune to pleasures and pains, and would be happy ever, and your god could stay with you. But such a belief is possible only under sedation or coma or something of that nature! But never as long as a person remains out seeking. Note that our very quest of 'Does God exist?' started us an out outward quest, after all! So this is a dead-end approach, you will never hit the target!

Another aspect of the question is, there is an inherent expectation that there is ''one'' God, but not many. This again arises due to an unconscious expectation that whoever we are seeking be the most superior of all, which precludes any competition! Secondly, whatever other believers think the answer to be, let my understanding of the answer be the superlative! I will be jumping a little bit ahead, but I had to say this here. Let us ask, how many skies are there? Even in English this is somewhat of a meaningless question. When we have something that is limited in its size in some fashion, or exists now and not later, or there are two things where one precludes the other to pervade the former, would we say there is one, two or many. But when there is only one, we can't say &quot;There is one&quot; like &quot;There is one sky&quot;. Try saying, &quot;One sky is blue&quot; to your friend, and don't shy from the strange looks! We just say &quot;sky is blue&quot;. When the status of a mere sky demands so much attention to detail and respect, how much should God garner, whom we want to hold so high? So &quot;God is One&quot; is a syntactical contradiction of amusing sorts! Any very ironically, however inaccurate the language is when it comes to God, it is very much true too! We shall see.

A moment on why we even ask this question &quot;Does God exist?&quot; We appear to ask this question with a presupposition about what God is and then try to ascertain whether such conceptualization meets the merits of our understanding of ''existence''! But why does this question arise? If we take away all the religions totally out of the equation, and then if one were able to raise this question, such a mind is extremely subtle, sharp and extraordinarily evolved. However this question is (100 - 0)% of the time is raised by religions. Their agenda is simple. Such a religion already has a conceptualization of what God is and follows it with an elucidation of such concept with a question like answer in &quot;What God is?&quot;. So this would be a self fulfilling prophesy of sorts but not a genuine inquiry or question. It will boil down the religion to a number game of believers and non-believers, something like a political system of power mongering. Sure, however sometimes one might find solace in numbers. After all, if one fool mingles seamlessly into an ocean of fools, one will not feel fish out of water! After all how many Socrates' are there! How many Jesus' are there! (Mind you, these names are quoted only to highlight the unique nature of their inquiry, but not in relation to our inquiry :)

Let us go back to the grammar of the question. There is a subject who set out on the inquiry, with an actionable verb of finding the object called God! Some of our stomachs churn if we look at this question like this! What? God, an object? Of course dude, this is plain English! Since this is not an acceptable characterization of the question then, there must be something wrong with the question itself! So we have to turn the question backwards. 'Do I exist?' or in other words, 'Am I the God?'

The most simple and the most intriguing answer to this question is just four letters short 'YES!'. Ya, you can cut it down to three, if you have guts to drop '!'.

My goodness, we started out with one question. We hardly seem to have answered. But managed to raise a serious controversy or even blasphemy in declaring ourselves to be God! This answer has myriad problems. At first looks, it means, there are many people (let us leave insentient things for now), and each one is god! So how many gods does it make, dammit??? Moreover each one of us never existed till one's parents met or till one found one's way somehow into a test tube! And each one of us is sure to vanish into oblivion sooner or later! So our god perishes so easily! God! We created a mess for god as well as ourselves with this answer!

But the mistake is who we thought ourselves to be, like what we thought God to be! When we said, &quot;I am God&quot; and concluded that god is transient and perishes, we are referring to the body. So drop the body, it is not god. Then go a little bit deeper. The mind then? The mind takes a hike when you do enough to qualify for a DUI (Driving under the influence of Alcohol!) ticket. It also takes a hike when a foot ball concussion is kind and strong enough! So this mind god also perishes! Can't be the God. Then we need to go to the roots of what 'I' is. So is it the first unqualified thought of 'I' that one might experience right after waking from bed? Well, we never really experience this since we never watch for it. We always wake up as Tom, Dick or Harry. But never as 'I'. With some ''immense'' practice, it is possible to see this 'I', at the time of waking, at first and then whenever you want, much later with much practice. So is it this 'I' the god then? Well, does 'I' exist, when you go into deep sleep or coma? There goes our iGod!

So we have to go deeper. Unfortunately language stops here. We have to somehow try to get back into deep sleep while we are fully wide awake! At such experience, what is out there, where there is no subject, object or verb, ''That'' is God. ''It'' is always there. ''He'' never dies. But our ever restless mind like the never stopping waves, obscures ''Her''. We don't deny Sun just because clouds covered him. So mind doesn't deny God just because it agitates. We just miss Him. This is funny, me missing myself? But how? That is yet another discussion!

Now let us analyze this God. Is such God 'one'? This is a ridiculous question since there is no one, two or many in Him. Hope you get the point. Second, is your god superior to mine? Quite a laughable proposition since there is no one, two or many gods. After all, neither even you nor me are there in Him! And She alone is ''all'', if there were ever an ''all!'' And is God a ''He'', or a ''She'', or an ''It?'' or some pronoun that a man is yet to manufacture?? None of the science of chromosomes will come our rescue here, sorry! After all who made the pronoun? Let him not stand above the God and create a pronoun for God, or should we??? And what about the fundamental question 'Does God exist?' If you are still after this question, you must be kidding!!! Whom? The answer should be quite interesting!

If we get this much right and tight, it has unimaginable, incomprehensible and quite surprising consequences. We wake up into a totally new dimension of awareness, existence and living. My goodness! Then what about me, my family, my friends, my enemies, my land, my property and my animals etc., etc.? What about them? What about all others and things around? Who are they? What is my relation to them? And these why/what/how W's will not end that easily. But that is yet another discussion! 

Wish you all the best!

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

=== Usage ===
This template should be placed on each &quot;allbooks category&quot;.  An allbooks category is associated with a subject category, &lt;code&gt;Category:''subject''&lt;/code&gt;, and is automatically populated with all books that belong to either &lt;code&gt;Category:''subject''&lt;/code&gt; or any descendant subject of that category.  The name of the allbooks category is formed by appending suffix {{nowrap|&quot;/all books&quot;}} to the name of the subject category, thus {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Category:''subject''/all books&lt;/code&gt;}}.

This template takes no parameters.

This template checks to make sure various associated pages are set up correctly for automatically populating allbooks categories.  If it finds a problem, it displays a notice explaining the problem and suggesting how to fix it, with buttons to perform likely remedial actions.

=== Internals ===
* Template {{tl|Allbooks category}} itself contains only the interface to the functionality: it determines the associated subject page name, and passes that information on for further processing to template {{nowrap|{{tl|Allbooks category/core}}}}.

=== See also ===
* [[:Category:Allbooks categories]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Terminology=

Before we start the implementation process, it is important to get familiar with the terminology commonly used in the rest of this book. At the beginning some words might be a bit puzzling, but with a bit of practice, you will find this terminology quite logical.

[[File:GNU Health create company.png|thumb|Company. An example of a Party]]
&lt;br/&gt;
* '''Party''' : In GNU Health, a party is an entity. An abstract concept to define someone or something that has legal status. It's the unit of the relationship in Tryton. Some examples of Parties are :
** Patients 
** Companies
** Health professionals
** Health centers
&lt;br/&gt;
* '''Model''': The model defines each object in GNU Health. Models define the database objects (tables). ''gnuhealth.patient'' is a model example.
&lt;br/&gt;
* '''Field''': The building blocks of the model. For example : ''age'' and ''sex'' are ''gnuhealth.patient'' fields. 
&lt;br/&gt;
* '''View''': Views are the representation of the model on the screen. Most models will have an individual form to accept data into the model and display data out from the model.
** '''Tree''' : The list format of the model. The tree view allow us to search  select multiple records. [[File:GNU Health disease genes tree.png|thumb|Example of a Tree list]]
** '''Form''' : The representation of the model on the screen that allows you to input data. [[File:GNU Health disease genes form.png|thumb|Form view of the same record]]
&lt;br/&gt;
* '''PostgreSQL''' : The database server that allows the storage and retrieval of our data.
&lt;br/&gt;
* '''Table''' : The model representation at the database sever. The model ''gnuhealth.patient'' is mapped in the table ''gnuhealth_patient'' in postgreSQL.
&lt;br/&gt;
* '''Record''' : Each unique entry in a particular database table. For example ''Ana Betz'' is a record on the ''gnuhealth_patient'' table in PostgreSQL. 
&lt;br/&gt;
* '''Tryton''' : Tryton is the development framework that is used in GNU Health. It covers most of the ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) needed to run an organization.
&lt;br/&gt;
* '''Python''' : The programming language used by GNU Health [[File:GNU Health modular design.png|thumb|GNU Health modular design]]
&lt;br/&gt;
* '''Module''' : Modules are programs that provide specific functionality. GNU Health provides different modules to meet your health center needs. Example of modules are ''Socioeconomics'', ''Genetics'' and ''Surgery''. You should only install the modules that are actually needed for your center.
&lt;br/&gt;
* '''Report''' : Reports allows you to dynamically print documents in Open Document / LibreOffice format (ODF), Portable Document Format (PDF) or even directly to the printer. [[File:GNU Health lab report sample.png|thumb|Sample Lab report]]
&lt;br/&gt;
* '''Action''' : Actions are processes excecuted upon one or more selected records.
&lt;br/&gt;
* '''Notebook''' : A tabbed group of forms designed to make navigation easier.
&lt;br/&gt;

= Navigation Area =
Now is time to identify the components of the GNU Health Screen. In the following screenshot we have marked the main sections :
[[File:GNU Health navigation area.png|center|330px|Navigating GNU Health]]
* '''Main Menu''' : We can navigate among the different functionalities. Configuration, Patients, Financial, ... You can deactivate the main menu (useful in low resolution devices) by pressing '''Ctrl+T'''
* '''Tabs''' : Tryton allows you to have multiple records open at the same time. The section &quot;Tabs&quot; of the screenshot shows the current form.
* '''Actions''' : Under the Tabs section you will find different icons that act upon the current record. You can, for instance, create a new record, generate a report, change the view, select related records associated to this patient (appointments, lab tests... ).
* '''Record form''' : This is where you see and input the information. Notice that you can have tabbed forms (notebooks) in the lower half of the form, which allows quick and easy navigation. In this example some of the tabs within the records are main, medication, diseases, surgeries, socioeconomics and gynecological information. The upper side of this form is static, so the health professional has the most relevant information about the patient always visible.
* '''Status bar''' : The lower side of the screen shows the status bar. From left to right, these are fields :
** '''User name''' : In this case we logged in as ''Administrator''
** '''Organization Name''' : ''GNU Solidario Hospital''
** '''Requests''' : Tryton has an internal messaging system. You will get notifications in realtime.
** '''Server Information''' : The lower right section gives you login and server information. In this example, it shows &quot;admin@localhost:8000/demo&quot;. ''admin'' is the login name, ''localhost'' the name of the GNU Health server, ''8000'' is the port where connects and ''demo'' is the database name.

= Form fields and field types =
Let's now go through the most relevant field types and how to properly use them. We will use the previous screenshot of the patient  as the example. 
* '''Text fields''' : These type of fields allow us to enter a lot of information. You will see them normally like large boxes. In our example, the field under &quot;Patient Allergies and Critical Information&quot; is a text field.
* '''Character fields''' : These type of fields are similar to the Text fields, but with a limited size. There are few character fields and none in this example. The ''diet type'' in the lifestyle section or the Gene ID on genetics are example for character fields.
* '''Date Fields''' : These fields will open a calendar when clicked, so you can choose the date. Alternatively, you can enter the date manually. The ''date of birth'' is a Date field.
* '''DateTime Fields''' : Similar to the date fields, but with the addition of time. An example of this field is the ''Date/time of birth'' of the newborn, in the neonatology module.
* '''Integer fields''' : These fields allow only integer numbers. They show a &quot;0&quot; by default. An example is ''Minutes of physical exercise per day''
* '''Float fields''' : You can enter decimal numbers. The ''body temperature'' is one example of a float field.
* '''Function fields''' : These are special fields, in the sense that they are calculated in real time, depending, most of the time, on the values of other fields. For example, the ''Patient Age'' is a function field. Notice that the field has a grey background, meaning that is '''read-only'''. It will calculate the current patient age in years/months/days depending on the patient date of birth. Another example of function field is the ''Hospitalization Status'' of the patient.
* '''Selection fields''' : These fields will let you choose from a list of options. For example, the patient ''Sex'' or the ''blood type'' are selection fields. This type of field minimizes typing error.
* '''Relational fields''' : These fields retrieve information from a related model. They are of the form One2Many or Many2One. Relational fields are important to keep the uniqueness of data. By using this type of fields, you link the ID of an existing record, without duplicating information, to another record. The ''patient'' is a relational (One2Many) field. It relates to the the ''party'' model, from where it gets all the administrative data (Social security number, address, etc... ).
:Shortcuts : '''[F2]''' will open the related record and '''[F3]''' will create a new record
* '''Required fields''' : These fields are mandatory. You must enter information or else the record won't be saved. You can quickly identify the required fields because they have a blue background. The '''Patient''' field is a required field.

== Time to Practice ==
'''Important :''' Make sure you are in your '''demo database'''. This demo database that you created has no important information. You can put anything you want. You can even delete it and recreate it. Just make sure you don't use a production database for your tests. One way to prevent accidentally entering the production database is to have a different password for your demo database, this way if you select the wrong database, you won't be able to login.
&lt;br/&gt;
It's been a lot of information! Now is time to play around with all this information.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
With the information try the following :
# Navigate in the Main menu
# Open the Configuration Submenu
# Create a Physician with the Family Medicine Specialty.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Can God be known?

''Very deep question indeed!'' At least that’s how it sounds!  Let us see.

Where does this question rest the real power in? In the person capable of knowing the God? Or in the object called God that will be known? If God is something that can be known, like any other object that can be known, who has more power? The one who is capable of knowing anything and everything, including the god himself or the knowable god? The answer should be obvious. The knower.

But isn't  the God supposedly the most powerful? Or is he something too powerless an object that could be known? We  ''know'' that the knower is the more powerful than the known. So should we not know that the knower could be the God Himself that might be known? If the knower is the God, your, me or anyone can know themselves? Let us see this one. 

Can I know myself? O ya, I bloody well know ''me!'' I have no doubts about myself! I am a Tom, a Dick or a Harry, after all! But if I am just a and mere a Tom, a Dick or a Harry, I am no God! I remain just a wretched Tom, a wretched Dick or a wretched Harry! That is all, nothing more nothing less! Just a name of some wretched form!

Now let us see what is that which usually does the knowing? The mind complex, the intellect or the internal consciousness or whatever you call it. But don’t we ''know'' our thoughts and mind is just thoughts? Yes. So they are still relegated to the field of our objectivity and hence inferior to us. So I must be distinct from mind. So if we drop the mind, we stand bare naked with an innate sense of I. Then drop that one too, into a homogenous sense of absence of multiplicity. That is something ''even God can't describe! After all even God can't know Himself!!! But why should He anyway!'' Is that a deficiency for Her to not to be able to know Him? Why should It know? What else is there to know in that homogeneity anyway!

''Whatever remains is the Knower that knows everything without needing to know anything since there is nothing else to know!'' And by the way, what might be the gender of the knower? He, She or It? He knows Itself to know that She can’t know Himself! 

So can God be known? ''Isn’t that a hollow question?''

      <text xml:space="preserve">What is the nature of the divine?

This very question the way it is posed takes away all the divinity that might otherwise be there! So long as one looks at the nature of the divine as something that is objectively comprehensible, they will never ever know, nor there anything left of divine to know! So long as you sit on the banks and try to measure the temperature, you will never know how hot or cold the water is. How deep or shallow the river is. Just take out all the clothing paraphernalia and jump right in, get immersed in. Once fully in, what cold or what heat! You should neither feel it, nor care any more to know it. You will realize that ''you just know that you already knew.'' So also take out all the adornments that we put on by habit. Drop all I, me, mine, he she, it and lose yourself into the divine. Once you are fully in, there remains nothing to be known, even the divinity that we started out to find. You will know that you, as if you were remaining as you, will know that you were ever divine even before knowing. Before you jumped in, while jumping in and after jumping in. And if only you could stay there in divinity, you can come right back out while still staying steady back there! 

So what is the nature of divinity? Hmm! So you still want to sit on the banks then! So be it!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Creator/Destroyer!

Human mind begot the religion. And religion begot the so called the Creator. Some religions stop at Creator and shudder to talk of the Destroyer. Some religions are bold and gracious enough to accommodate the Destroyer too! After all, what goes up has to come down. What is creatable must also be destroyable too. But it begs the question who created the Creator? The religion, of course! And who created the Destroyer? However paradoxical this question might sound in its syntax of juxtaposing creation of the Destroyer, the answer is of course, our beloved religion! None else!

Now let us settle the Creator first. Usually we call this guy, the god! The god creates. Does he really? Let us see. What did he create? The physical objects, environment, life, etc. Hmm! You are being bashful! What about your neighborhood terrorist that could blow a bus load of kindergarten age children and still be able to sleep in peace? What about that drug lord who sells and kills in the name of drugs? What about all the ills and the stench of the world? After all, the religion that accepts the creator must also account for these lapses and negativeness too! Most religions sulk at this. But still the religions have a marvelous answer for this quandary. 'Shut up! Okay?' Or they may say, &quot;Sir, God created just good things, and a free will. But the man misuses free will and begets violence and bad things&quot;. Then we go, &quot;OK, then what about the tsunami that killed innocent thousands in one flush of a sweep the other day!&quot;. Oops, the benign and kind creator concept of religion runs into pot holes right away!

OK, for now, let us accept the Creator. But where was He before creation? He must have some space to sit or stand. So did he create the space or space predates him? What about time? Was there a time when creation was not and he was there at that time? So time was there or not there before creation? Who came first, Creator or time, or space? Problems and problems! And who told you that creator created, did you see him do it? Oops, I was not there to witness. Then who told you. Of course, you guessed it. The religion! And who created religion? Can't be the Creator. If he did, he must be nuts to have created so many mad and even violent varieties of religions! Then who is the culprit? If you haven't guessed, let me help you. It is YOU who created religion! Then religion creates creator. And creator creates the man! And man creates the religion! Man! Mind spins into an infinite loop here! One last laugh on this religious creator goes like this! The religion man says, there was a creator that looked like the man himself and such creator created the man as an image of himself, which is like the man himself! How ludicrous and untenable is this theory! In this argument of religion the principle of sublime alter is totally lost and the wrangling settles on man and his madness!

Let us see if we can figure the ''end of the Destroyer!'' Is he one and same as creator? Na! Can't be. When you create something so exalted and beautiful, you can't have the heart to destroy the same, do you? So destroyer must be another then, let us at least assume so. But if he can destroy, what was creator doing? The creator can't even protect what he created? If he can't, which of them is more powerful? And this lands us into yet another problem again! 

But religion has a single answer to all of this, &quot;have faith or your tongue will split into thousand pieces due to this blasphemy!!!'

Now one might say, &quot;Sir, what are you talking, you are blaspheming the underlying themes of all religious beliefs!'. But the point is, is there something higher and more noble than the blind religion? Secondly, the concept of Creator and/or Destroyer, is only and only meant for lifting one from the incessant body identification to a higher realm to submit oneself at a superior altar. Be it Creator. Be it Destroyer. So the question of Creator and/or Destroyer or whether they are one, two or many is irrelevant. Lift the focus from the low planes of me and mine and broaden the outlook stretching to the whole creation, and eventually losing the locus of focus in your tiny self! For that purpose alone, Creator exists, or Destroyer exists. Not a tit bit beyond that! So, so long as this question does not resolve on itself and disappear, the answer is a firm affirmative. Have no doubts about it. Once the question drops, you will discover the question to be no longer relevant!

==1. Prerequisite: Tree Honor==
{{ay prerequisite|Nature|Trees}}

==2. Learn the proper use of the following common forestry tools and practice using them on trees in a forest. Record the information for each tree giving also the common name of each tree:==
For this requirement you will need access to a forest and permission from a land owner to bore into the trees.

You can go as a group, but each person in the group must take several measurements.  In addition to the equipment listed below, each participant should bring a notebook and a pen for recording measurements and observations.

===a. DBH (diameter at breast height) tape – measure the diameter of trees (or measure the tree circumference and calculate the diameter)===

A DBH-tape is a form of dendrometer that consists of a cloth or metal tape that is mainly used to measure diameter at breast height (DBH). DBH is measured at a fixed height of {{units|140cm|4.5 feet}} above the ground, where it is most convenient to measure diameter. DBH is measured up high so to avoid measuring a tree's butt swell. Butt swell is where the base of the tree is unconventionally fatter than the rest of the tree. Height and diameter are used to determine the volume of a given tree, measuring above the butt swell is required to provide the most accurate measurement.

Diameter is easily measured because the tape is calibrated in units of 3.14 (&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;) inches or centimeters. The tape is actually measuring the tree's circumference but since circumference and diameter are related by pi, the diameter can easily be obtained.  The only problem with the diameter tape is that the measurements assume the tree's trunk cross-sections are perfectly circular. Thus the diameter tape just gives an approximation, regardless it is the most commonly used dendrometer for DBH.

===b. Clinometer or Tangent height gauge – measure the height of trees===
{|
|[[Image:Clinometer commonly used by foresters.JPG|350px|thumb|A clinometer used in forestry]]
|[[File:Clinometerlow.jpg|thumb|350px|Hand made clinometer]]
|}
The clinometer, known in many fields as an inclinometer, is a common tool used in forestry to measure slope, vertical angles, and – in combination with distance measurements – elevation change or tree heights.

A forester using a clinometer makes use of basic [[trigonometry]].

First the observer measures a straight-line distance ''D'' from some observation point ''O'' to the object. Then, using the clinometer, the observer measures the angle ''a'' between ''O'' and the top of the object. Then the observer does the same for the angle ''b'' between ''O'' and the bottom of the object. Multiplying ''D'' by the  tangent of ''a'' gives the height of the object above the observer, and by the tangent of ''b'' the depth of the object below the observer. Adding the two of course gives the total height (''H'') of the object, in the same units as ''D''.

Note that since multiplication is distributive it is equally valid to add the tangents of the angles and ''then'' multiply them by D:

:''A'' = tan ''a''
:''B'' = tan ''b''
:''H'' = (''A'' &amp;times; ''D'') + (''B'' &amp;times; ''D'') = (''A'' + B) &amp;times; ''D''

Note also that both angles should be positive numbers (i.e. ignore any minus sign on the clinometer's scale).

If you are doing this activity with a large group, you may wish to make several simple clinometers using paper, a protractor, a tube, and a weighted string (see the photo above). Note that the 0° mark is at the bottom center, so that if the tube is held level, the string will line up with this mark (showing no incline).  To use this device, sight the top of the tree through the tube while another person takes the reading from the scale.

===c. Increment borer – count the growth rings to determine age===
===d. Prism – estimate the basal area per acre or hectare===

==3. Use the information gathered in #2 to determine the board foot volume of the trees in the forest you measured.==
==4. Calculate the basal area of a tree from the diameter (dbh) or circumference measurement. What is basal area per acre or hectare?==
==5. Study five tree species important to forestry in your area and give the following information about each: &lt;br&gt;a. common and scientific name&lt;br&gt; b. range of tree&lt;br&gt; c. height and diameter of tree at maturity&lt;br&gt; d. common use and importance of tree&lt;br&gt; e. habitat of tree, forest zone, and elevation==

==6. List the benefits of forest to the environment, water quality, air quality, wildlife, and recreation.==
==7. List the uses of wood produced in the forests in your area, and which tree species are important for each use.==
==8. Discover &amp; Discuss the following: How are forests managed to reduce the damage from insects and disease? What factors influence fire behavior?  Considering that wildfires produce both benefits and destruction, what treatments could reduce wildfire severity?==
==9. Do one of the following in forest regeneration:==
===a. Tour a forest seedling nursery===
===b. Plant forest seedlings or forest seed===
==10. Explore the biblical stories in Genesis 1-3 and Revelation 22 that talk about the tree of life. In your discussion, discover the role of trees in God’s perfect environment, and our responsibility to take care of our environment.==

      <text xml:space="preserve">Miracle!

The moment we utter this word, we long left the realm of spirituality and strayed way deep into the jungle thickets of blind religion! After all what is a miracle? A miracle is one which defies normality. Make clouds rain gold coins. God forbid lest someone's head might bleed but ''that's a miracle!'' Make a goat lay a man. Of course miracle! Some miracles may not be funny and may even be very conducive to harmony and peace as well, like, say reviving the victims of a car crash or even a tsunami. These are no doubt miracles.

Now let us say, we do find someone who could do such inexplicable things. What is in it for us? That someone could do, but not you! One might say, &quot;sir, that solidifies my faith in him!&quot;. Hmm! If the one who is capable of these things, why does he care a hoot for your meagre and/or stupid faith? He can create the faith if he so desires! The counter could be, &quot;He did all these to lift my soul higher&quot;. 

YES, here we come to the crux of the problem. What we are saying is, &quot;God, first show me a miracle, then I will see if the miracle is good enough of your power to submit to you or not!&quot; My goodness! So we want to test the Lord! So miracle is the test for the Lord to garner support of the decadent lot! So Lord is such a cheap magician dying for our popularity!

And some religions even go out of their way to declare somebody a saint, who might already be very noble otherwise. And they do this most of the time after the person died. Or such a noble person may never accept to such stupidity. So let the person die first. Then resurrect him as a saint! ''Or kill him yet another time!'' And to qualify to be a saint, the person must have done at least a couple of miracles! Otherwise he can't be ''MADE'' the saint, even if he were one already! He must have sneezed an ounce of silver or vomited pound of gold! If one is such a great miraculous person, what does a stupid title of sainthood bestow on him extra anyway? A live miraculous person will never care. And nor does a dead one either! So who cares? ''The ones assuming the charge of making the kings!'' So they patiently wait the real saint to die first. They had to! And then do their bidding! Stupid religiosity.

But the greatest miracle is to be able to know that you can't know the God but know Him anyway to be no different from yourself or anyone to the extent there is no you or anyone, but just ''Him that is It and She!'' Knowing God is knowing everyone as no different from oneself. ''This is most rarest and most toughest miracle of all!'' The person who can do this miracle is a saint without the need of any titles whatsoever! While being alive or while being dead, for ''such a He is never alive nor dead!''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cycling is a healthy, convenient, and sustainable transportation alternative, but since the introduction of motorized vehicles, it has declined significantly across the globe. However, cycling is still wildly popular in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands Netherlands] compared to the rest of the world, but not by accident.  

=History=
In the early 1900s, the Dutch cycle paths were narrow, of poor surface, dangerous or even absent at junctions, and not interconnected. Truly dedicated cycle paths were not necessary as cycling was the primary means of transportation. After [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II World War II], as the Netherlands became wealthier, cars became more common&lt;ref&gt;Ebert, A. (2004). Cycling towards the Nation:The Use of the Bicycle in Germany and the Netherlands, 1880-1940. European Review Of History, 11(3), 347-364.&lt;/ref&gt;. [[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Rijswijkstraat Batavia TMnr 10014865.jpg|thumb|right|A street in the Netherlands in the 1950's with relatively few cars]] This led to car domination of streets originally intended for bicycles and horse-drawn carriages.  To make room for cars, buildings were demolished and some of the old cycling infrastructure was removed. This was clearly demonstrated in the town of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoogeveen Hoogeveen], where streets once used mainly by cyclists became car dominated by the late 1960's. The streets were reconstructed to improve driving safety with little regard for cyclists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwanen&quot;&gt;Schwanen, T., Dijst, M., &amp; Dieleman, F. M. (2004). Policies for Urban Form and their Impact on Travel: The Netherlands Experience. Urban Studies (Routledge), 41(3), 579-603.&lt;/ref&gt; An informative blog documents the [http://hembrow.blogspot.com/2010/09/transformation-in-centre-of-hoogeveen.html transformation of a street in Hoogeveen] from 1945 to 1965 through photographs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hembrow&quot;&gt;Hembrow, D. and Wagenbuur, M. Transformation in the Centre of Hoogeveen. Retrieved from http://hembrow.blogspot.com/2010/09/transformation-in-centre-of-hoogeveen.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The street once ideal for bicycling was completely reconstructed for drivers. A canal was filled in for a safer driving path and center lanes became parking lots. 

Although cycling remained common, it had become dangerous. With car-dominated roads, the number of cyclist-car collision accidents skyrocketed. As a result, cycling declined by 6% every year.  3,300 lives were lost in 1971 alone and over 400 of these deaths were children under the age of 14.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doc&quot;&gt;Documentary: How the Dutch got their cycling paths. Retrieved from http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=XuBdf9jYj7o&lt;/ref&gt; The slaughter of children led to protests by a group called &quot;Stop de Kindermoord&quot; (Stop the Child Murder in Dutch) who demanded safer streets for children bicycling. Their voices were heard, especially in 1973 when the first oil and economic crisis led to a gas shortage and high energy prices. Then Prime Minister, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joop_den_Uyl Joop den Uyl], declared that the Dutch would change their ways and be less dependent on energy. Policies to encourage cycling emerged as the first city centers were made car-free. Continued protests and [http://sustainablecitiescollective.com/projectpublicspaces/32021/how-dutch-got-their-cycle-paths mass cycling tours] created an awareness that eventually changed the way of thinking about transportation policies. In the mid 1970s, municipalities started experimenting with safer cycle routes separated from motorized traffic.  Since then, a considerable effort had been made to implement a new bicycle-friendly infrastructure in the Netherlands..&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwanen&quot;/&gt; The same street in Hoogeveen previously mentioned was reconstructed once more to be reserved strictly for cyclists. The first cycle routes were created from scratch and financed by the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_Netherlands Dutch government].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pucher&quot;&gt;Pucher, J. and Buehler, R. Making Cycling Irresistible: Lessons from The Netherlands, Denmark and Germany. Retrieved from http://www.vtpi.org/irresistible.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This not only led to an increase in cycling by 30-60%, but also led to leaders and planners to consider cyclists in infrastructure design.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doc&quot;/&gt;  With the new infrastructure, the Netherlands now has the lowest non-fatal injury rate and lowest fatality rate regarding cycling accidents in the world even with such a large percentage of the population cycling.  27% of trips in the Netherlands are made on bicycle compared to only one percent of trips in the United States and the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pucher&quot;/&gt;  This success is a result of many factors, and an example from which the world can learn.

=Infrastructure=

The Dutch philosophy on creating bicycle friendly infrastructure is based on safety and convenience. There are five requirements necessary; cycling paths must be safe, direct, comfortable, attractive, and cohesive. The routes are required to be short and logical from the origin to the destination, have smooth surfaces and generous cycling space, and be void of smell or noise inconveniences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ministerie&quot;&gt;Ministerie van Verkeer en Waterstaat. Cycling in the Netherlands 2009. Retrieved from http://www.fietsberaad.nl/library/repository/bestanden/CyclingintheNetherlands2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Cars have been banned from many roads to make room for cycling. In many areas, such as the main street in Hoogeveen, cars were no longer allowed and the space is reserved specifically for cyclists and pedestrians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hembrow&quot;/&gt; [[File:Hoogeveen Daan Cascade 03.JPG|thumb|right|A street in Hoogeveen in 2010 reserved for cyclists]] Today, almost everyone in the Netherlands is both a driver and a bicyclist, and equal attention is given to infrastructure for both modes of transportation. Many roads have dedicated cycle paths completely separated from motor vehicles which allows for safe and comfortable cycling and driving.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pucher1&quot;&gt;Pucher, J., Dill, J. and Handy, S. Infrastructure, Programs, and Policies to Increase Bicycling. Retrieved from http://www.bikeleague.org/news/pdfs/pucher_preventative_medicine.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entirely Segregated Traffic Networks===

In order to encourage use, cycle paths must be safe. In many cities in the Netherlands, including the largest ones, there is complete segregation between bicycling paths and motorized traffic. [[File:Rotterdam Fietspad Westzeedijk.jpg|thumb|right|Complete segregation between bicycling paths and motorized vehicle roads ]]This entirely segregated traffic system has improved traffic safety tremendously for both drivers and cyclists.  Many older cities are also  reserving centralized, historic streets exclusively for cycling. Generally, if speed limits are near or above 50 km/h, cycling paths and motorized traffic need to be completely separated. &lt;ref name=&quot;Ministerie&quot;/&gt;  As speed limits and traffic volumes increase, the separation between cycling paths and motorized traffic should also increase. For example, cycling paths adjacent to highways are typically separated by a small field rather than a strip of grass or concrete used as in lower traffic areas.

===Combined Profile Traffic Networks===

For residential areas or areas where the speed limit is 30 km/h or less, traffic network separation is less important. Although there are no physical boundaries between cyclists and motorized traffic on combined profile roads, there are often markings or symbols that indicate bicycle lanes. These lanes are painted red, indicating that they are legally dedicated cycle lanes. These combined profile roads are perfectly safe as long as strict speed limits are enforced. Sometimes speed limit enforcing measures such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_hump traffic humps] create a hindrance for cyclists. To address this issue, the smooth 0.12 m tall, half-sine-shaped hump was specifically designed to interfere with the suspension of cars, but create no inconveniences for cyclists. Railway level crossings have been replaced by dedicated bicycle underpasses for safety. &lt;ref name=&quot;Ministerie&quot;/&gt;

===Other Bicycle Friendly Measures===

Many suburban areas in the Netherlands are separated from cities by wide canals or rivers. Previously, bridges connecting to the cities were designed for motorized vehicles with high traffic and speed limits. Cyclists were forced to take long detours for their commute until new bicycle bridges were constructed. [[File:Grave (N-Br, NL) fietspad van de Maasbrug.JPG|thumb|right|Cyclists crossing a river using a bicycle bridge]]

At [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_light traffic lights], there are different signals for cyclists and drivers. Sensors for detecting cyclists give two green sequences per bicycle. There are also timers which tell cyclists how long they have to wait for the next green light.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_circle Traffic circles] have also seen improvement to cater to cyclists.  Previously, cyclists yielded to cars in fear of a collision in which they would suffer far greater injuries than the motorist. The alternative traffic circle design includes a completely separated cycling track around the motorized traffic circle with at least 10 m distance between crossing places for cyclists and cars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ministerie&quot;/&gt;

===Bicycle Parking Facilities===
[[File: Bicis a l'estació de Leiden.JPG|thumb|right| Bicycle parking lot in Leiden, The Netherlands]]
[[File:Fietshangar3.jpg|thumb|right| Convenient, secure bicycle garage used in residential areas]]
Designated bicycle parking facilities are another essential piece of cycling infrastructure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pucher1&quot;/&gt;  These facilities are designed to provide safe, clean, and easy bicycle parking as close to the cyclists' destination as possible. Bicycle parking facilities are ubiquitous in the Netherlands ranging from bicycle parking lots outside school and office buildings to large scale multi-level parking garages strictly for bicycles outside popular shopping centers and train stations.  Small bicycle garages provide secure, convenient bicycle parking at home, the most common departure and destination point for cyclists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ministerie&quot;/&gt;

=The Benefits of Bicycling=

The benefits of bicycling encourage the Dutch to make more trips on bicycle than any other mode of transportation. Cycling is economical, costing far less than both the private car and public transportation, both in direct user costs and public infrastructure costs. It only requires a small fraction of the space needed for driving and parking cars. Furthermore, bicycling causes virtually no [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_pollution noise] or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution air pollution] and consumes far less [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-renewable_resource non-renewable resources] than any other mode of transportation.  The only energy cycling requires is provided by the cyclist, and the very use of that energy offers valuable cardiovascular exercise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pucher&quot;/&gt; Compared to countries with similar wealth, the Netherlands has a relatively low rate of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity obesity] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease heart disease]. Those who ride a bicycle for 30 minutes a day are physically five years younger than those who lack this daily exercise.&lt;ref name=&quot;The netherlands&quot;&gt; Dutch Cycling Embassy. (2011). The Netherlands: A history of cycling innovation.&lt;/ref&gt;

=Other Factors Contributing to Bicycling's Popularity=
===Fuel Prices===
The Netherlands has relatively low car ownership compared to countries of similar wealth.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank. (2008).  Motor Vehicles per 1000 People. &lt;/ref&gt;  In part, this can be attributed to the very high cost of fuel in the Netherlands. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline Gasoline] prices in the Netherlands are among the ten highest in the world and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_fuel diesel] prices are among the 25 highest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ebert, Metschies, Schmid, Wagner.  (2009).  &quot;International Fuel Prices 2009&quot;.  Eschborn, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is due, in large part, to high taxation of both fuels and certainly makes cycling an appealing alternative when compared on a cost basis.

===Geography and Density===
The Netherlands is among the flattest countries in the world, which certainly makes bicycling less physically strenuous.  The majority of the population lives in the flattest part of the country.  The three largest cities, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam Amsterdam], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam Rotterdam], and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague The Hague] have total elevation differences of less than 10 meters, including parts which are below sea level.&lt;ref&gt;Actueel Hooghtebestand Nederland.  http://www.ahn.nl/viewer&lt;/ref&gt;  The Netherlands is also among one of the densest countries in the world&lt;ref&gt;Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division (2009) (.PDF). World Population Prospects, Table A.1. 2008 revision. United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt; which naturally means that trips are shorter.  Generally, cycling is only preferred for journeys totaling to or less than 5 km.

===Weather===
[[File:Woman riding a bike under rain.jpg|thumb|right|Woman cycling in the rain holding an umbrella]]
Bicycling in inclement weather is not very common in most countries.  However, in the Netherlands, even when it rains, everyone [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkgKYjrNLwg continues to bicycle], perhaps with the addition of an umbrella in their free hand.  Generally, weather in the Netherlands is quite mild, with temperatures rarely above 23 degrees Celsius in the summer and rarely below 0 degrees Celsius in the winter.  Rain in the Netherlands is not typically intense, which makes bicycling less unpleasant as compared to in other countries. Extreme weather conditions such as snow are rare to non-existant.&lt;ref&gt;Weather Underground.  (2011).  &quot;Seasonal Weather Averages&quot;.  Amsterdam.  http://www.wunderground.com/NORMS/DisplayNORMS.asp?AirportCode=EHAM&amp;StateCode=&amp;SafeCityName=Amsterdam&amp;Units=none&amp;IATA=WUI&amp;normals=on&amp;MR=1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety===
The Netherlands has the lowest cycling fatality rate in the world. Cycling is over three times as safe in the Netherlands as in the UK and more than five times as safe as in the USA, which explains why the Dutch do not perceive cycling to be a dangerous way to travel. Safer cycling in the Netherlands, however, is not due to the widespread use of helmets. In the Netherlands, less than one percent of adult cyclists wear helmets and among children, only three to five percent wear helmets. Helmets are seen as unattractive and therefore discourage cycling. Helmets also provide a false sense of safety, which may encourage risky riding behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;At the frontiers of cycling&quot;&gt; Pucher, J., &amp; Buehler, R. (2007). At the frontiers of cycling: Policy innovations in the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany. World Transport Policy and Practice, 4-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=Conclusion=
Bicycling in the Netherlands clearly shows how technology cannot succeed on its merits alone.  The inherent benefits of bicycling, although clear to the Dutch, were not enough to make bicycling as wildly popular as it is today.  To foster success, the Dutch made cycling irresistibly convenient and safe, developing an extensive and dedicated cycling infrastructure. This proved to would-be-cyclists that their presence on the roadways of the Netherlands was not just possible, but expected.  A similar phenomenon can be seen with another environmentally friendly means of transportation.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car Plug in electric cars] are touted by many to be the wave of the future, but opponents claim that their limited range will doom them.&lt;ref&gt;The Telegraph.  (2011).  &quot;Nissan Hits Back at Top Gear&quot;.  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/top-gear/8676473/Nissan-hits-back-at-Top-Gear.html  &lt;/ref&gt;  Supporters and opponents, however, agree that without a network of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charging_station charging stations], their adoption as a mainstream means of transportation will be limited.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, A.  (2011).  Interview.  &quot;Nissan Executive Vice President Andy Palmer speaks to the Global Media Center&quot;.  Nissan Global.&lt;/ref&gt;  Much like how the Dutch strove to create a national system of cycling infrastructure, many countries are now striving to create a national system of plug in charging stations.  Policy makers acknowledge that the setting must be adapted to a technology just as much as a technology must be adapted to its setting for success.&lt;ref&gt;Haggerty, J.R. and Ramsey, M.  (2011).  &quot;Charging Stations Multiply but Electric Cars are Few&quot;.  Wall Street Journal.  &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Calculations and functions in a CRF ==
In your XL for the CRF you can choose in column N, RESPONSE_TYPE, the type &quot;calculation&quot;. In other programs this is sometimes called a Derived Field. You can use it for example to add the values of two items, Item1 and Item2, both integers. &lt;br /&gt;
The way to do this is make an item SumOfItem1AndItem2, type calculation. Now, we will start with column Q RESPONSE_VALUES_OR_CALCULATIONS. Here we put our calculation in format &lt;b&gt;func: Item1 + Item2&lt;/b&gt;. Because of the fact that we fill in something in this column, we must also complete the two preceding columns, RESPONSE_OPTIONS_TEXT and RESPONSE_LABEL. To keep things easy, we just fill in &quot;calc&quot; for both.

=== Using the pow-functions in your calculations ===
In the example above we added the values of two items and likewise we can subtract them, but what if we want the difference between the two items? And not just Item1 - Item2: we want the absolute difference between Item1 and Item2.
In our calculations, we can use two functions, POW and DECODE.&lt;br /&gt;
POW stands of course for Power and it works with two parameters: a number and the power (surprise!) For example pow(2,3) is 8. We can use 1/2 for the square-root, so pow(25, 0.5) is 5.&lt;br /&gt;
We set this to work in our quest for the absolute, by typing in column Q: &lt;b&gt;func: pow(pow(Item1-Item2,2),1/2)&lt;/b&gt;. This functions first takes the power of 2 of the difference and then takes the square-root, resulting in the absolute difference.

=== Using the decode-function ===
Another example of using a function in your CRF can be when you want your users to enter temperature in both Fahrenheit and Celsius. You design your CRF with a field Temperature and a field TempUnit and also a calculated field TempInCelsius. In TempUnit the user chooses between Fahrenheit or Celsius and the result is F or C.&lt;br /&gt;
In our calculation to degrees Celsius, we will use the decode-function. The syntax of this function is
# a variable to evaluate
# one or more key-value pairs
# a default

In our case we will test item TempUnit. If this is &quot;C&quot;, then we will take the value of Item Temperature. In the other case, so the default, it will be Fahrenheit, so we will subtract 32 and then multiply it with 5/9. The function then looks like 
&lt;b&gt;func: decode(TempUnit,C,Temperature,((Temperature-32)*5/9))&lt;/b&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Several other historical technologies apply to this case. For the purposes of this chapter, we will show the progression of communications technologies over time. 

Do I need citations for the fact that many other technologies follow this model, or can I get away without having citations here? 

Opposing side: 
Children don't make friends with those don't have cellphones. -&gt; dependent on cellphones &quot;because of social&quot;
http://news.ufl.edu/2007/01/18/cell-addiction/

Social norms on cellphones: 
http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2006/11/the-definitive-guide-to-cell-phone-no-nos310.html --&gt; has quotes from different people

Theories:
The change of space and/proximal relationships
Pro: individuals are able to remain in close and instantaneous contact regardless of where/when they are
Pro: increase productivity for cooperation, etc. 
Con: old generations vs. young generations -&gt; gap
Con: cell phone usage when hanging out with others (&quot;present absence&quot;)
Con: invading other people's spaces (may not related to our topic)

Cell phone dependency

Con: &quot;social dependency&quot; -&gt; cannot function well without cell phone on daily basis 
Con: draw attention from other communications

SMS
More like a &quot;filler&quot; communication [maintenance, romance ], not functional/practical communication between individuals 
Pro: Concerns that the increased use of SMS will decrease face-to-face, but researches show that text messaging can actually built up a stronger tie 
Pro: survey shows that 47% of teens say without SMS the social life would end or be worsened
Con: Grammar? 
Con: parents cannot intercept or have access to the content of the communication
Pro: privacy

Social groups: 
Adolescents and young adults
Individual with low self-esteem typically do not communicate face-to-face, but they use phones to build social networks
Female and male -&gt; females are more dependent on cellphones

http://www.unh.edu/sociology/media/pdfs-journal2009/Corbett2009.pdf

conclusion:
The effects of this technology are yet to be seen. Once an entire case studies of developing nations are especially interesting since the before and after case, as well as the number of phones in use, can be well documented.  There are social groups who argue for and against cell phones, and both have valid points.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Anthropology and religion!

Before we dive into this topic, it is interesting to see that there could be myriad ways to pair the religion with, like 'Psychology and religion', or 'Science and religion' and so on. But what might easily be missed are 'Zoology and religion' or even 'Schizophrenia and religion!' After all the man who created the religion with a noble intention of lifting one's outlook to a nobler alter, has also degenerated its sentiment into the current grand circus called 'religion.' It has become as fit as an animal study of zoology, or as maddening as schizophrenia!

Once we got this out of the way, let us talk about &quot;Anthropology and religion!&quot; In this topic, there is fundamental clash of ''ideas!'' Note the word ''ideas!'' Anthropology appears to propagate the idea that the nature evolves by itself, organisms morph and develop by themselves. Not sure if this can be proven scientifically or not, but sure wish and pray that it is provable! If proven, in fact it bolsters the argument for a Creator hundred thousand times than it opposes! And Anthropologists caught in monkeys don't realize this! They resist to acknowledge that the intelligent principle is built right into the very makings of the creation and the created. Or may be that they hate to refer to It as Creator. After all Creator is a word created by man. So It may as well be called 'Life' or even 'Qxz', after all the Real Creator has no name, nor does He care! Moreover, a stone left to itself for ever can never become an egg, does it? Let see how a man gets drunk. Because he drinks the juice of a dead and rotten fruit? So a dead and inert thing can influence a sentient being! Really? Is it the dead fruit's juice that  made him morph into a hallucinating maniac or it is the live bacteria in the rotten juice that did the trick? So the boundaries of inert vs sentient blur and may easily miss our attention. Nor Anthropologists, however strongly antagonistic to the concept of Creator, will ever claim that insentient can evolve into sentient! They say only live things evolve. And they are absolutely right, just that they explain only a small but major part of the story of creation, the sentient. So why does the religion have to divorce the very life from the concept of their Creator and raise cudgels against Anthropology? After all, the very life is just one of many manifestations of the Reality, called Creator. And Anthropology, if it is a science, is just an obedient tool in establishing the reality of the Creator! Doesn't matter if an Anthropologist accepts it or not! If Anthropology does not cover insentient, that is a different matter. Just that its focus and purpose are limited but well served though. So the real Anthropology, not as promulgated for the purposes of atheism, can never be opposed to Spirituality. But to religion, it may sure be! We will see how.

Now comes the religion. This unfortunately is on a much weaker footing than Anthropology! Because the fact is, Anthropology is God's creation where as religion is the stupid brain child of the decadent lot mongering to garner popularity in numbers! When God created Anthropology, He in grained Himself into His creation in the form of Life. And made things live and kicking! And when man created religion, he too entered into to it, but only as a dead beat stupid! He got a problem now. He manufactured religion. And religion manufactured its own version of the creator. And this ''c''reator runs right in opposition to the real ''C''reator propounded by the real Anthropology! Who is right? Does the Upper win or the mere lower? For anyone who knows even a tiny bit of English, it should become immediately clear that Upper is no doubt higher than the lower! So the real Anthropology's real Creator beats the bogus creator manufactured by the religion hands down, any time!

Now this leaves us with the question of place of religion with respect to spirituality. A true religion has extraordinarily noble and worthy intentions. It is to lift the vision from the low life to the Ultimate. To lift from the irrelevant arguments to submit and lose into the Universality and to avoid controversies and discordance. So a religion that finds controversy with God's creation, be it the Anthropology or the real religion, then it is no religion. It has some ulterior motives. So we don't have to belabor it any more. A true religion is true Anthropology. A true Anthropology is the true religion. And for that matter, any true branch of science is a profound religion!

      <comment>/* Cell Phone Dependency */ +{{disputed|date=December 2013}}. See talk.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">
== Introduction ==
[[File:2007Computex_e21-MartinCooper.jpg|thumb|Martin Cooper]]
Cell phones may have started out as a gadget for adults, but they have now become a necessary item for the entire family. In 2004, 45% of children younger than 18 years old owned a phone; but by 2010, that percentage rose to 75%{{ref|children with phones|[1]}}. Today, children as young as seven years old are more likely to own a cell phone than a book{{ref|phonebook|[2]}}. This dramatic increase in cell phone use by children raises a whole new set of concerns.

==='''History'''===
On April 3, 1973, [[w: Martin Cooper (inventor)| Martin Cooper]], a manager for Motorola,  made the first cellular phone call from the streets of NYC to his rivals at [[w: Bell Labs| Bell Labs]]. The phone he used was a prototype of the [[w: Motorola DynaTAC| Motorola DynaTAC]], which was 9 inches tall, weighed 2 1/2 lbs, contained 30 circuit boards, had 35 minutes of talk time, and required 10 hours to fully recharge{{ref|wired|[3]}}. 

In the thirty-eight years since that first call, there has been a dramatic evolution of the cell phone. Since the first commercial release of cell phones in the early 80s{{ref|pcworld|[4]}}, phones have become smaller, more affordable, and more capable. While cell phones and their growing capabilities have many benefits, their use also carries some risk.

== Social Connection vs. Social Isolation==

==='''Social Connection'''===

Each new cell phone model is released with an intended use in mind. These purposes include basic communication (texting or calling), pictures or videos, calendar applications, and Internet connection. The most recent cell phone application is the [[w:Siri (software)|iPhone 4 Siri]] in which a user cannot only communicate with others, but can also communicate with his or her phone by talking directly to it.

Because most adults did not grow up using cell phones, they use this techology as a means for communication. But when cell phones are put into the hands of children, the use can quickly extend beyond those originally intended.

====''Adolescent Theories''====

E. Elkind proposed adolescent egocentrism, a psychological theory about the social interactions of adolescents.{{ref|Egocentrism|[5]}} During this developmental stage, adolescents are known to be self-conscious and have extremely low self esteem, and therefore, have a need to feel included, accepted by peers, and connected. The feeling of belonging that many teenagers strive for has been found in the security of a cell phone.  Cell phones give children the ability to bond with others, form a private social life, overcome feelings of awkwardness by communicating indirectly, and therefore, it provides a symbol of acceptance that most teenagers struggle to find.{{ref|Acceptance|[6]}} While walking down a sidewalk full of strangers, a cell phone is often seen as a social lifeline to many teenagers in today’s [[w:Social isolation|socially isolated]] society.{{ref|Lifeline|[7]}}

==='''Social Isolation'''===

Although cell phones have fulfilled the need for children to be connected, overuse of this technology can result in social alienation.  Because children have the ability to be in constant contact with people from different cities, states, and even countries, they can involuntarily alienate themselves from their current, social surroundings. 
[[File:Cell_phones.jpg|thumb|Social Isolation Caused By Cell Phone Usage]]

====''Social Development Alterations''====

The overuse of cell phones by children can stunt their social development by not allowing for the development of skills such as the ability to:
* Summarize: Because texting allows children time to think before they respond, the ability to express opinions in a clear and concise manner is harmed.{{ref|Lifeline|[7]}}
* Read social cues: Cell phone dependent children often isolate themselves in social situations and therefore never develop the ability to read social cues, which is detrimental to future educational or professional environments. 
* Be aware of social surroundings: For example, children crossing a street while using a cell phone are less likely to look both ways, and are therefore 43% more likely to be struck by a passing car.{{ref|Pedestrian|[8]}}

====''Cell Phone Dependency''====

{{disputed|date=December 2013}}

The availability of cell phones to children creates a cause for a childhood addiction. Cell phone dependency is characterized by extreme [[w:Extraversion and introversion|extraversion]], [[w:Neuroticism|neuroticism]], and low [[w:Self-esteem|self-esteem]].{{ref|Egocentrism|[5]}}  Today, an extraverted personality is a positive attribute, but when it is extreme, a person has an obsessive need to be with or in communication with a person at all times. Teenagers already have a stereotypically low self-esteem, so those that are dependent on a cell phone for communication will have greater difficulty overcoming this barrier. {{ref|Lifeline|[7]}}

== Parents' Control v.s. Children's Independence==

Cell phones produce the conflicting results of giving parents more control and giving children more independence. While the appeal of cell phones includes child safety, cell phones can often be dangerous to own.

==='''Cell Phone's Enable Parental Control'''===
[[File:Treo 650 TomTom Navigator.jpg|thumb|Cell Phone GPS Tracking Capability]]

Parents may feel that their child is safer carrying a phone. Cell phones give parents peace of mind since it provides instant connectivity. Parents can contact their children to determine their whereabouts and activities. Especially for children far away from home or with divorced parents, the cell phone allows parents to stay involved in their child's life. 

A phone can be used to teach children responsibility. They will learn to care for their phone, avoid losing it, and stay within their plan limits. At a young age they will learn about budgets and social etiquette. 

Parents often use cell phones as a means to discipline their children. Sixty-two percent of parents take phones away as punishment, and 52% of parents limit the time of day their children may use their phone {{ref|ParentalControl|[9]}}. Parents can also give their children boundaries such as to call them whenever they change locations. The rules parents establish regarding cell phones may improve a child's behavior.

In a 2009 survey, 64% of parents look at the contents of their child’s phone, and 48% of parents use phones to monitor their child's location {{ref|ParentalControl|[9]}}. There are many pieces of software available that parents can buy to monitor their child’s cell phone activity such as [http://www.iwondersurf.com/ iWonder Surf] and [http://www.webwatchernow.com/mobile-phone-monitoring-software/?refID=lnkshr&amp;siteID=sYZWWQeqRbc-QYTmWClve2.394h2xhLdWQ Webwatcher Mobile]. To activate and view activity, a parent has to secretly install the software on their child’s phone and log onto their online account. They can view [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System GPS] location, text messages, and call information. Parents can even disable web access during school hours.

==='''Cell Phones Enable Children's Independence'''===

Frequently cell phones have the opposite result of giving children more freedom, which can expose them to serious risks. With instant connectivity possible, children today are more likely to be able to leave home. The cell phone also enables children to lie about where they are and what they are doing. 

By having more independence, children may be more vulnerable to certain dangers such as sexting. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexting Sexting] is the sending of sexually explicit messages or photographs between phones. [[w:Vanessa Hudgens|Vanessa Hudgens]] and [[w:Miley Cyrus|Miley Cyrus]] are examples of young celebrity role models who had nude text messages leaked to the public. Sexting is becoming increasing popular among middle school and high school students. The coming of age mistakes and immaturity are becoming even more visible with cell phone technology. Over 15% of 12-17 year olds claim they have received nude photos from text messages {{ref|Sexting Statistic|[10]}}.
These actions can lead to serious consequences such as embarrassment, misdemeanors, felonies, and even child pornography charges. 

Cells allow a new way for children to be bullied. Over 1 in 5 teens have been cyber-bullied{{ref|Cyber-bully Statistic|[11]}}. Cyber-bulling can lead to low self-esteem, depression, suicide, violence and school failure. 

Cell phones also open up children to communication with predators. Predators not only target children through texting, but also through webcams, the internet, and social networking sites available on many phones. Over 1 in 7 children have been propositioned online for sex from a predator {{ref|Predator Statistic|[12]}}.

== Helpful in Emergency vs. Health Emergency ==

==='''Helpful in Emergency'''===
Cell phones are extremely convenient in emergencies. In most situations in which emergency help is needed, people can now pull out their cell phones to dial 911 or access information quickly. In large-scale emergencies, parents can contact their children to assure they are safe, and schools can send alerts to the entire student body{{ref|Babay|[13]}}. This is an overwhelmingly positive benefit to the widespread use of mobile phones. In these cases, it could be argued that cell phones ''save'' lives. However, some would say the negative health side effects outweigh the benefits of being able to make an emergency call.

==='''Health Emergency'''===
[[File: Tumor BrainstemGlioma2.JPG|thumb|right|MRI of child with brainstem tumor.]]
Cell phones are known to generate [[w:electromagnetic field|electromagnetic fields]] (EMFs). This is how they communicate with cell towers and why we can communicate almost everywhere. The problem is that phones emit these electromagnetic waves in all directions, including into our bodies. A 1996 study explored the [[w:Specific absorption rate|Specific Absorption Rate]] (SAR), the rate of energy absorption, in models of a human adult brain, a 10 year old brain, and a 5 year old brain during cell phone use.  Their study showed notably higher SAR's in a 10 year old than an adult, and even higher SAR's in a 5 year old. These results prove that EMFs penetrate deeper into children’s brains than adults’ brains{{ref|Gandhi|[14]}} and contribute to the idea that cell phones may be more harmful to children than to adults. This increased susceptibility to EMF penetration is attributed to the fact that children have smaller brains and softer brain tissue than adults{{ref|Chalfen|[15]}}. 

In response to the fears that cell phones are causing [[w: brain tumor|brain cancer]], many researchers have tried to determine whether cell phones (or the electromagnetic radiation they emit) are actually ''causing'' brain cancer. In the first study focusing specifically on children{{ref|Boice|[16]}}, Aydin et al. looked specifically at children with brain cancer. The group looked at 352 children (7-19 years old) from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland that had been diagnosed with a brain tumor between 2004 and 2008. Their cell phone usage times were estimated based on interviews and examination of their phone records. Despite fears, they found no evidence tying regular cell phone use to a higher risk of cancer in children{{ref|Aydin|[17]}}.

These conclusions regarding cell phones and brain cancer need to be qualified. Due to the recent increased use of cell phones, especially among children{{ref|Pew|[18]}}, it is not yet possible to evaluate their long term impact on health. Unfortunately, experts estimate that symptoms may not   appear until 15 to 35 years after initial use{{ref|Pitt|[19]}}; therefore, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to prove causation at this time{{ref|German|[20]}}.

==='''Society's Reaction'''===
Some groups, such as the International Parenting Association, take this qualification to the extreme and insist that cell phones will harm children and should ''never'' be used{{ref|Parenting|[21]}}. Others would site more definitive research supporting the contrary, such as a paper from the Journal of the National Cancer Institute that states: “there is no known biologically plausible mechanism by which nonionizing radio waves of low energy can disrupt DNA and lead to cancer” {{ref|Boice|[16]}}.

We can't currently prove causation, but we also can't prove non-effect. With no definitive support for either side and the possibility of years before such support arrives, we must ask ourselves and important question: Should we deprive ourselves (and our children) from the benefits of cell phones because of potential risks to our health?

== The Generalizable Lesson ==

Cell phones were initally created to socially connect our society, improve safety, and be helpful in health emergency situations. But with these benefits have come consequences, especially for the growing number of children with cell phones. Some consequences include cell phone dependency, vulnerability to dangerous people, and potentially harmful radiation. This case can be broadened to more generalizable lessons. As seen from the examples above, technology may be created with certain ''intended'' purposes, but those purposes can change and evolve once the technology is put into the hands of a user. Furthermore, while there may be many benefits associated with a new technology, there may also be unforeseen consequences of its widespread use.

==Mode &amp; Markets==
The Interstate Highway System, formally known as the &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower Interstate Highway System,&quot; is a network of cross-country automobile highways, devoid of traffic lights, with grade separated crossings and limited access. The main advantage of this design is not having to stop for cross traffic. By not having to stop at traffic lights or stop signs, momentum is not lost, and energy for travel is used more efficiently. The main markets for the Interstate Highway System include: the military, freight travel by heavy trucks, and of course the automobile. The interstate Highway System is also referred to as the &quot;freeway.&quot;

==Setting the Scene==
Prior to the advent of the Interstate Highway System, automobiles had already become the most popular and, in some cases, preferred mode of travel in urban centers, especially new suburbs. However, most interstate travel, including the shipping of goods, was done via the railroads. Although the railroads were and still are a more efficient way of moving mass amounts of goods, the rigid track system with it's mainly set courses made it difficult to provide last-minute shipments. The freedom of mobility, and the unlimited routing possibilities an interstate highway system could provide, was what initially stirred interest in such a project. But it was National Defense concerns and military interests that were used to justify to the public the necessity of funding the project; and in 1956, the Federal Aid Highway Act was passed.

==Design==
The Interstate Highway System's design was heavily influenced by the &quot;Autobahn&quot; highway system in Germany. During World War II, General Dwight D. Eisenhower saw the advantage Germany had over American Allies at moving troops and ammunitions around Germany. However, this is not to say the United States didn't already have examples of highways with grade separated crossings, they did, but on a much smaller scale. The Pennsylvania Turnpike, which later was incorporated into the Interstate Highway System, is one example of this. There were many limited access interstate highways prior to the implementation of the Interstate Highway System, however, these were usually winding, narrow roads with few lanes and at-grade crossings. 

The greatest difference between the U.S. Interstate Highway System and Germany's Autobahn is where each highway system runs in relation to the respective country's urban centers. The Interstate Highway was initially designed to go around urban areas, like the Autobahn does. However, in it's implementation, the Interstate Highway System ended up cutting through urban centers. This design alteration was intentional, in the hopes that it would generate economic development in urban centers. The design change had both intentional and unintentional consequences. The design intentionally cut through low income neighborhoods, displacing many. However, some unintentional consequence include: the creation of new barriers which broke up the urban fabric, enabling decentralisation and sprawl on a level never before seen, and, consequentially, the decline of urban centers.

The shift from rural highways to the Interstate Highway System--for Interstate travel--came naturally, and was seen by most as a great improvement over the previous highway system. Some new design elements, which the public had to adapt to, include: on-and-off ramps, signage, higher posted speed limits (which speeds people were happy to go), and interchanges. Regardless of these new infrastructural additions, the rules of the road, such as passing on the left or signaling to change lanes, stayed the same.

==The Role of Policy==
During the birthing stage, and well into the growth phase, individual states set their own speed limits. They ranged from 40 miles per hour to 80 miles per hour. It wasn't until 1974, when President Nixon signed the Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act, that a national speed limit of 55 miles per hour was locked in and enforced, in the hopes it would lower foreign oil dependence. 55 miles per hour was supposedly the most fuel efficient speed for automobiles of that day. This Act wasn't repealed until 1995. Today speed limits range anywhere from 35 miles per hour to 80 miles per hour, depending on the terrain and the amount of access points.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/nixon-signs-national-speed-limit-into-law&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth and Implementation==
The Federal Highway Act of 1956 sent the Interstate Highway System into a major growth phase. 90% of the original funding came from a government sanctioned one cent gas tax. the rest of the funding came from the individual States, who all got their funding by similar means. All funding came from the public sector. The only role the private sector might have played in the implementation of the Interstate Highway System was influencing the location of acces points on the freeway.

In urban centers, limited access points on the Interstate Highway System were not as limited as in rural areas. As a result, people began using the freeway for short trips around town and as a way to commuting to work. with higher speed limits, people could travel farther distances in less time. Therefore, houses out in the suburbs, which prior to the Interstate were impractical, now seemed practical. Many people moved to suburbs with convenient access to the Interstate. However, because so many people decided to move out to the suburbs and become dependent on this one system of transportation, the system became strained in urban areas resulting in stop and go traffic jams. In an attempt to relieve this congestion, many of the urban freeways have been widened. But these efforts proved to be in vain, as tripple convergence would undoubtably occur.

==Maturation==
The Interstate Highway system reached maturity in the early 1980's, and today the infrastructure is mostly built out. Durring the maturity phase, there were many attempts to make the system more efficient; new policies and infrastructure were tried, tested, and implemented. Examples of these include: Traffic System Management Tools such as ramp meters; Highway Helpers; HO/T (HOV) Lanes; Park and Ride Lots (to encourage the use of an alternate mode); Highway Access Management; and Peak Pricing. Beyond these, there isn't much that can be done to improve the Interstate Highway infrastructure. Future advancements, if any, will likely be due to improvements made to the vehicles that use the road. There have been great advancements in automated vehicles. These advancements, if fully realized, may be the answer to the inefficiencies of the current system.

The buffalo was worshiped by the Native Americans, however they thought the settlers were wasteful and careless with this animal..]]

== Reconstruction ==

We have reached the period of westward expansion after looking at the Civil War and then reconstruction. [http://www.history.com/interactives/civil-war-150#/wiki] Reconstruction was literally &quot;reconstructing&quot; the United States after the Civil War ravaged physical, economic, and political aspects of the Confederacy.

== Ten-Percent Plan ==

Before he died Lincoln had a plan for reconstruction... Lincoln’s plan was a lenient one. Lincoln called his plan the Ten-Percent Plan. Under said plan the government would pardon all Confederates, except high-ranking officials and those accused of crimes against prisoners of war, who would swear allegiance to the Union. As soon as 10% of those people who had voted in 1860 took this oath of allegiance, A confederate state could form a new state government and send representatives and senators to Congress. Under this rule there were 4 states that moved towards readmission: Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Virginia. [http://www.oldstatehouse.com/exhibits/arkansas-politics/onthestump-4d2.asp]


[[File:Lincolnassassination.jpg|thumb|Lincoln's Assassination at Ford's Theater]]

Not everyone agreed with the Ten-Percent plan. Radical Republicans wanted no political power for former slaveholders and this group was led by Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner. 

As we know Lincoln was killed so it was up to his successor Andrew Johnson to take the reigns of reconstruction. Johnson created his own plan but it wasn’t much different. To change the ten-percent plan he said that high-ranking confederates and wealthy southerner landowners couldn’t vote. 

All 7 remaining slave states quickly agreed to Johnson’s plan. Texas was the only one of the 7 that didn’t set up a new state government and elect representatives to congress. 

== The Horse and the Buffalo ==

[[File:DeepSpringsCattleDrive.jpg|thumb|Cowboys on horse]]

The culture of the Native Americans began to change rapidly. The Spanish brought over horses, which changed the pace of hunting for the natives. They also started using guns to help kill buffalo. The horses and guns made it more efficient and easier for them to hunt. The majority of the tribes left their farms to search the plains and hunt buffalo. Buffalo was a necessity for the Native Americans. They used them for teepees, clothing, shoes, blankets, and food. Since they were able to hunt them easier, they had their basic needs. This was a positive thing for the Native Americans, but it also had its down falls. Since they were able to travel further, they trespassed on other tribes’ land what ended up leading to war and battles. Some warriors were honored to kill the enemies. The natives would sometimes call a truce so they could trade and exchange news.

This picture shows how the lives of Native Americans were changed by the Spanish and U.S. Troops. They could easily hunt now with horses and rifles. Hunting became faster and easier for them. In the picture, the Cheyenne Indians are fighting and shooting at the U.S. troops. The Native Americans and Americans fought because the U.S. troops and people would steal their land or take their materials that the Natives used for granted, like the buffalo. The Americans did not respect the Natives’ rights and morals.

The buffalo were very important to most Native Americans in the past. They were part of their every day life. Buffaloes were used for homes, clothes, food, and many more things. Native Americans did not take the buffaloes for granted; all parts of the buffalo were great use to them. Once the U.S. people started coming West, they realized how they could use the buffalo for food as well. The population of the buffalo decreased drastically, and the Native Americans’ lives were changed forever. The Americans did not use all parts of the buffalo that were useful. Sometimes they would even kill them just for fun, while the Indians would use all of it because they needed it. The buffalo were very important to the Native Americans, and once they were almost all gone because of the Americans, they could not continue living the way they used to.

== Family Life ==

To the Native Americans, family was extremely important. The tribes would contain family groups with ties to other tribes that spoke their same language. All the people in the tribes had certain jobs. Usually, the young men would train to become hunters and warriors like their fathers. Men or women could become a medicine doctor, called shamans, to heal the wounded with the spirits. The women cooked the food and made the shelters and clothing. They taught their daughters to do the same. The Plains Indians often believed that everything had spiritual meaning. They believed in the Great Spirit, which had power over all things like animals, trees, and the weather. They believed the earth and sun was a mother of all the spirits. The food and land was sacred. Their culture was molded around stories and myths. The tribes never had one ruler; they had a counsel. The leaders of the tribe would make sure everyone was able to use the land and didn’t let anyone dominate their tribe.

For the Cheyenne Indians, the people in the tribes had many roles. The children would play and go to school. Sometimes they would go hunting and fishing along with their fathers. Women roles were being in charge of the home. They cooked and cleaned, but also they built the houses and dragged around the heavy posts for the homes when they moved. The men were hunters and warriors. They were responsible for getting food to feed their families. Only the men could become chiefs in the Cheyenne tribes.

== Massacre at Sand Creek ==

[[File:Fort-lyon-vhs00109.jpg|thumb|Fort Lyon]]

Massacre at Sand Creek In 1864, the Cheyenne tribe went to Sand Creek Reserve in Colorado for the winter. They assumed they would be protected by the government, but the government wanted the land for white development. There were several fights over the land, and the Native Americans and the white people finally met together and agreed on peace terms. A group of about 600 Cheyennes camped out about 40 miles north of Fort Lyon. They were following all the rules they agreed on, and thought they would be safe if they did what the government asked them to do. However, General Curtis sent a telegram to Colonel Chivington saying, “I want no peace till the Indians suffer more.” Chivingston had previously stated that his goal in life was “to kill Indians,” so he happily responded by sending his troops to fight the Native Americans on November 29, killing over 150 people, mostly women and children. When Chivingston was asked why they killed so many children, he responded by saying, “Nits make lice.” [http://www.lastoftheindependents.com/sandcreek.htm] [http://www.archaeology.org/9911/newsbriefs/sand.html] [http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1258507/sand_creek_massacre.html] [http://www.kansasmemory.org/item/211654]

== Death on the Bozeman Trail ==

The Bozeman Trail ran straight through Sioux hunting grounds. The Sioux chief had been trying to get the government to shut down the trail, but they did nothing. In December of 1866, Crazy Horse and about 2000 Indians attacked Captain Fetterman and his men as they traveled the trail. They killed over 80 soldiers. Native Americans call this the Battle of the Hundred Slain and Americans call it the Fetterman Massacre. Fetterman was considered not very smart, and he hated Indians with a passion. He also believed that no matter how many Indians there were, a regiment of American soldiers could defeat them. He foolishly led his men to believe that 80 of them could defeat the entire Sioux Nation. As the Indians attacked for the final time, Fetterman and his second in command agreed to shoot each other at the same time The government forced the Sioux to sign the Treaty of Fort Laramie, where they agreed to live on a small reservation next to the Missouri River. Sitting Bull, the leader of the Hunkpapa Sioux, was the one leader who didn’t sign it. The groups who did sign it thought they would still be able to leave their reservation to hunt. [http://www.philkearny.vcn.com/fettermanfight.htm][http://www.essortment.com/fetterman-massacre-21591.html] [http://theminiaturespage.com/boards/msg.mv?id=218962]

== Red River War ==
The Camanchi and Kiowa tribes had been raiding for six years. The United States wanted to move the Camanchi, Kiowa, Southern Cheyenne, and Arapaho Native Americans to reservations. During this time, the Native Americans and the settlers did not get along. The U.S. thought it would be safer for the Native Americans if we made them frontier houses on the reservations. Some Native Americans chose to live in the frontier houses but still raided other camps and used the houses as safe houses. Those who did not go along with the United State’s tactics were under fire. General Philip Sheridan gave orders to “Destroy their villages and ponies, to kill and hang all warriors, and to bring back the women and children.” Because the United States was so violent and merciless, the resistance in the southern plains were crushed. 

“This war did not spring up on our land, this war was brought upon us by the children of the Great Father who came to take our land without a price, and who, in our land, do a great many evil things... This war has come from robbery- from the stealing of our land.” -Spotted Tail. The Medicine Lodge Treaty of 1867 set aside reservations for the Native Americans that would provide education, food, guns, and supplies. Ten Native American tribes endorsed the treaty and promised to stop the raids if they would be able to live in the reservations. The U.S. stated in the treaty, “They can hunt on any lands south of the Arkansas River so long as the buffalo may range thereon.” Basically the U.S. was promising them land to hunt the buffalo that the settlers could not touch. The American settlers ignored the law and hunted on Native American land anyway, and they practically wiped out the buffalo population. The U.S. government didn’t keep their promise and the food that was provided was bad quality and the living conditions were poor. The reservations also had many restrictions, limiting the Native Americans on where they could go, and they had never experienced that before. This caused a lot of unhappiness in the reservations. Some Native Americans were so unhappy that they joined tribes who had broken free to the Texas plain. These groups of Native Americans took it upon themselves to drive the white man out of their land. “When a white army battles Indians and wins they called it a great victory, but if they lose it is called a massacre.”-Chiksika.

== Gold Rush ==

[[File:Gold-cat10x.jpg|thumb|Gold]]

Within four years of the treaty of fort Laramie, miners began searching the black hills for gold. The Sioux, the Cheyenne, and the Arapahoe protested to no avail. In 1874, when colonel George A. Custer reported that the black hills had gold “from the grass-roots down” A gold rush was on. Red Cloud and Spotted Tail, another Sioux chief, vainly appealed again to the government officials in Washington.
   
In January 1848, James Wilson Marshall discovered gold while constructing a saw mill along the American River northeast of present-day Sacramento. The discovery was reported in the San Francisco newspapers in March but caused little stir as most did not believe the account. [http://www.findingdulcinea.com/news/on-this-day/On-This-Day--President-Polk-Sparks-the-California-Gold-Rush.html][http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/californiagoldrush.htm][http://www.blackhillsvisitor.com/main.asp?id=14&amp;cat_id=30156][http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/us/A0807775.html]

Sutter, a Spanish man grunted land in California, discovered gold. He tried to keep it a secret and, though the information leaked, no one really believed it. One of the most famous methods of mining is gold panning. The miners would search for gold in the rive by shifting through the sand  . Many thought that gold existed in sheets and would flow into the river. Whoever found that source would be rich.[http://www.historichwy49.com/goldrush.html][http://www.ghosttowngallery.com/htme/history.htm][http://www.sierrafoothillmagazine.com/goldmethods.html][http://www.historichwy49.com/goldrush.html]

== Custer’s Last Stand ==

Custer was a Lieutenant and led the 7th Cavalry to charge into battle against Lakota Sioux and Northern Cheyenne tribes. Custer's job was to force the Native Americans back to their reservations. Some of the people refused to leave their sacred land. So Custer attacked the from the north. He and all of his  265 soldiers were killed in less then an hour. This was a short-lived victory for the Native Americans. Sitting Bull later escaped to Canada. The Souix treaty of 1868 was similar to this event. American settlers wanted the Native Americans out of the land so they could take it. Therefore, they pushed the Native Americans out of their land, almost always leading to a battle between the two groups. [http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/recon/jb_recon_custer_1.html][http://www.custerslaststand.org/][http://www.sonofthesouth.net/union-generals/custer/custers-last-stand.htm][http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/sioux-treaty/]

On the morning of June 25, 1876, Lieutenant Colonel George A. Custer and the 7th Cavalry charged into battle against Lakota Sioux and Northern Cheyenne Native Americans. Their goal was to have the Native Americans back to their reservations. Some of the Native Americans refused to leave their sacred land, and other hunters were camped in remote places and never learned of the order. The U.S. Army prepared for a battle anyways. Led by Crazy Horse, Gall, and Sitting Bull, the warriors had raised spears and rifles crushed Custer’s troops. Within an hour, Custer and all o the men of the Seventh Cavalry were dead. In 1876, the Sioux were beaten. Sitting Bull still had a few followers took refuge in Canada. Soon enough Sitting Bull surrendered. [http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/recon/jb_recon_custer_2.html][http://www.custerslaststand.org/][http://www.friendslittlebighorn.com/custerslaststand.htm]

== The Dawes Act ==

[[File:CERA prairie.jpg|thumb|left|The Dawes Act broke up reservations and gave land to individual Native Americans]]

The Dawes act was to turn Native Americans into farmers or landowners by providing them with 160 acres of land. A single person would have 80 acres. The people thought this law would “civilize” the Indians but little did they know the Indians wanted their own culture. It was adopted by congress in 1887 and was named for the sponsor Henry Dawes. [http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=50][http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dawes+act+of+1887][http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=50][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawes_Act]

== The Destruction of the Buffalo ==
Along time ago, thousands of buffalo roamed North America. Native Americans used the buffalo for everyday means and survival. The Native Americans used the skin for clothes and shoes; the meat for eating; the bones were used for utensils and scrapers; hooves for cups; fat for soap and tongues for hairbrushes. When they killed a buffalo they didn’t waste any part of the buffalo. Native Americans worshiped the buffalo and then settlers came and started killing them. The settlers started to kill the buffalo and sometimes they just did it for fun. They could kill buffalo without frightening any of the others. After awhile the buffalo became more sparse and weren’t what they had been before. [http://www.heritage-images.com/Preview/PreviewPage.aspx?id=1156774&amp;pricing=true&amp;licenseType=RM][http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/american-buffalo-spirit-of-a-nation/introduction/2183/][http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/tserve/nattrans/ntecoindian/essays/buffaloc.htm][http://www.jstor.org/pss/30237207]

== Wounded Knee ==

[[File:Wounded Knee aftermath.jpg|thumb|Wounded Knee aftermath]]

After many battles with the Americans the Sioux were very desperate. They were suffering from disease and poverty. In there desperation they were told by a prophet that their way of life would be restored if they did the ghost dance. Alarmed by the number of Native Americans doing this the Americans tried to arrest the Sioux chief Sitting Bull. 

When 40 soldiers went to do this one of them was killed by Sitting Bull’s bodyguard. This caused the remaining soldiers to kill Sitting Bull. A couple of weeks later Custer’s old regiment rounded up 350 freezing Sioux as they were trying to flee to the south. They caught them on the banks of Wounded Knee Creek about twenty five miles west of current day town of Martin, South Dakota. 

While rounding them up a shot was accidentally shot by somebody and it caused the American soldiers to kill 300 of the Indians, most women and children. Although it did bring an end to the Ghost Dance religion it didn’t end the Sioux way of life.This was the final bloody end to the Indian wars.

In an autobiography by Black Elk, he describes how he did not feel bad for all the women and children who died because he thought that it would be better for them in the otherworld than to live here with the kind of people that would do these things to women and children. He also said that he would rather move on with them, but he needed revenge first.

== Vaqueros and Cowboys ==

The cowboys and vaqueros were proud of the work they did and most of them came from Mexico. They weren’t in great demand until the railroads reached the Great Plains. When a Cowboy wasn’t driving cattle he was working on the ranch. Vaquero is translated into the words cow and man. Vaca means cow. In English, it was demoted to cowboys.    They used Texas Longhorns for food, work animals and transportation. [http://mistercrew.com/blog/2010/06/20/cowboys-and-vaqueros/][http://www.slideshare.net/astaburuaga6/vaqueros-and-cowboys]

For every 3 cowboys were in the US 1 was a vaquero. Vaquero is Spanish for cattle herder. The American cowboy began from Spanish tradition. The beef industry was very small until the Civil war and the beef industry became large with a demand for beef. The Civil war was when the cowboy started to become famous, and after the Civil war was when poor Confederate soldier and freed slaves started looking for work on the ranch. In the 1880s the cattle industry started to move north, so the space for ranching became much larger. English speaking cowboys often trained horses by &quot;breaking them&quot; by a cowboy that specialized in training horses, but then they realized that they needed a more humane way so they used a new technique used by the vaquero.

== Growing Demand for Beef ==

The Native Americans were the first to hunt and work the land. Unfortunately for them them, the settlers growing need to own land, find gold, and raise livestock led to the Native Americans disappearance. Many bloody battles resulted as the settlers and Native Americans fought. After the Civil War and many of the buffalo had died out, there was more land on the open plains. Ranchers started using the large spaces of land to raise cattle. Cities across the nation were growing. Railroads were used to transport cattle from Missouri to Texas to keep up with the growing demand for beef across the country. 

Unfortunately the main route from Sedalia, Missouri  to Texas had a few of its own obstacles. The first obstacle was bad thunderstorms affected the trade route. Another problem was the flooded rivers along the trade route. The final  obstacle was angry farmers who blocked and tried to prevent the herds transported and being sold. These obstacles led to the ranchers trying to find more efficient and better trade routes. [http://www.slideshare.net/DHUMPHREYS/gcse-history-american-west-revision][http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h46-am.htm][http://www.cimarronnm.com/PDF/Dawson-Goodnight-Loving_History.pdf]

After the Civil War, there were more cities being built and the demand for beef went up. In 1865, the Chicago Union Stock Yards opened. After a harsh winter, in the spring of 1866, the railroads running through Sedalia, Missouri, opened. Ranchers and cowboys brought their cattle up from Texas to Sedalia going through Kansas. They then took their cattle to towns such as Chicago. The route to Sedalia had many problems. There were bad thunderstorms and rain-swollen rivers. There were also many forests, and some cows would get lost. Some of the cows were sold at low prices, and other cows died of starvation. In 1866 the farmers were angry about their trampled crops, and they blockaded the cattle. That prevented them from reaching Sedalia.

== The Cow Town ==

In 1867 Joseph McCoy proposed a plan too some western towns to make a trail to where rails and shipping yards where. He came to a small town called Abilene and quickly build a hotel and some cattle stalls. Joseph soon came across a problem that he couldn’t bring cattle through Missouri because a sickness that cattle had been carrying got people sick. He got though this law by paying a 10,000 dollar bond to pay for any problems and damages.

After he could bring cattle through Missouri, O.W. Wheeler brought 2,400 steers from San Antonio. In the next five years over three million heads of cattle where brought to Abilene from Texas. Soon Abilene became know as a rough town because of all the cowboys in the town. [http://www.vlib.us/old_west/trails/cthist.html][http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ay0c2][http://www.thechisholmtrail.com/begin4.htm]

Cattlemen drove there cattle down three main trails, one being the Chisolm trail which became very used. It was said to be one of the wonders of the world. It was named after Jesse Chisolm that was a part of Cherokee. He built trading posts. During the Civil war the cattle multiplied they were only worth 4 dollars a cow. The cowboys would go and buy the cattle and go back home on the trail. It stretched 800 miles. 35000 head of cattle went on this trail. Business doubled to 75000 head of cattle and the chisolm trail went really wide. [http://www.thechisholmtrail.com/][http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/C/CH045.html]

== A Day’s Work ==

[[File:Grabill - The Cow Boy.jpg|thumb|left|The Cow Boy]]

Today I will be telling you about a day’s work as a cowboy. A cowboy is a person who tends cattle on ranches in North America, traditionally on horseback. Some cowboys worked at rodeos also. The cowboy has deep historic roots tracing back to Spain and the earliest European settlers of the Americas.

A cowboy worked 10 to 14 hours a day on a ranch and 14 or more on the trail. They had to be alert at all times for dangers that might harm or upset the herds. Some cowboys were as young as 15; most were broken-down by the time they were 40. A cowboy owned his saddle, but his trail horse usually belonged to his boss. He was an expert rider and roper. His gun might be used to protect the herd from wild or diseased animals rather than to hurt or chase outlaws. [http://www.infohorse.com/cowboytraining.asp][http://www.texomaliving.com/cowboys-at-work]

The life of a cowboy consists of, long cattle drives,which in  1867, the first cattle drive from Texas up the Chisholm Trail arrived at the rail yards of Abilene, Kansas.  long hours, and roundups. Their daily life consists of working 14 hours on the ranch and 14 or more on the trail driving cattle. Young cowboys were 15, most were broken down by the time they were 40. A cowboy may own his saddle, but the horse is his boss's. They have to be excellent ropers, and expert riders. The only time they had to use a gun was to protect the herd from diseased animals, rather then to hurt or chase outlaws. The golden age of cowboys only lasted from 1867 - 1886. [http://www.thewildwest.org/cowboys/wildwestcowboyfacts.html][http://www.gregorarndt.de/University/Modern_History/Cowboys/Cowboy_Facts/cowboy_facts.html][http://www.thethomasranch.com/thomas_ranch_037.htm]

== Roundup ==

[[File:Grabill - Round-up at Moss Agate.jpg|thumb|Grabill - Round-up at Moss Agate]]Time when cowboys round up longhorns they find in the open range into a large corral. They keep the herd penned for several days, so that they are so hungry that they would rather graze than run away. Then they marked and claimed the herd. Then the trail boss chooses a crew for the long drive. 

Cattle driving was a major economic activity particularly between the years of 1866-1886. Long distance cattle driving originated in Mexico, California, and Texas. Sometimes it was horses instead of cattle though. Spaniards started the ranching industry in the New World. The roundup usually needed at least 10 cowboys, with three horses per cowboy.

When the cowboys finally reached the end of the trail, they celebrated. Then they started the process again. The cattle drive was a unique time, but id did not last long. The drives ended in the 1890s for multiple reasons. When settlers moved west they planted crops around where the cowboys would take their herds. Barbed wire was also another major reason. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_drives_in_the_United_States][http://www.swco.ttu.edu/history_trunk/ranching frontier.htm]

A traditional thing for cowboys to do was to roundup cattle. It was a very difficult task and took time to do. They would starve cattle until they would graze instead of run away because they were so hungry. While they were grazing people would look at the cows and decide which one they would drive. Cows were worth $5-$10 and were important.

Today we still do cattle roundups, but they are vacations rather than a lifestyle. Nowadays they mean how manly you are rather than how much money you can make. It is important to round up cattle but I think I’d rather get paid to do it than pay to do it. 
[http://www.texasalmanac.com/topics/agriculture/cattle-drives-started-earnest-after-civil-war][http://www.doubleeranch.com/roundups.html][http://www.bitterrootranch.com/roundups.htm] - 
== The Long Drive ==

The long drive was difficult for both the cowboys and the cattle. If the cowboys made the cattle go too many miles in a day, the cattle might become underweight and unhealthy. They usually traveled 15 miles a day, which meant it took around 3 months to make the journey.
There were about 3,000 head of longhorns in a herd. For each herd, there were about 10 cowboys to help them along, with 3 horses per cowboy. The trail boss handled negotiations with settlers and Native Americans along the way. They were paid at least $100 per month. Cowboys were in their saddles all day, slept on the ground, and bathed in rivers. Cooks drove the supply wagons and handled medicines.
There were a lot of dangers in the job. Even the slightest sneeze could set the herd off in a stampede. There were many storms out on the plains, and metal attracts lightning. So they put all their metal possessions at the edge of the camp away from the cattle. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_drives_in_the_United_States#Movement_of_cattle][http://www.texasalmanac.com/topics/agriculture/cattle-drives-started-earnest-after-civil-war][http://www.historyonthenet.com/American_West/cattle_industry.htm]

From dawn to dusk, cowboys herded cattle miles at a time during a day. About 3,000 cattle were being herded. This took about 3 months at a time. They had to take a lot of precautions. Like when their were lightning storms they had to put all of their metal possessions at the edge of their camp, and if they made the cattle move to fast, the cattle would lose to much weight and by the time they got to their destination the cattle wouldn’t be any good. The cowboys bathed in the rivers that they went by on. They had many cowboys to help. They had a cook, night hawk, wranglers, and one cowboy for every 300 cattle.

== Legends of the West ==
[[File:Annie Oakley shooting glass balls, 1894.ogg|thumb|left|Annie Oakley shooting glass balls, 1894]]
Annie Oakley was one of the legends of the wild west.  She was called “Little Sure Shot” by Sioux chief Sitting Bull.  Annie started shooting game when she was nine years old to support her widowed mother and her siblings.  By the time she was sixteen years old she was known as a “dead shot.”  She won a shooting contest in Cincinnati by one point to Frank E. Butler who was a well-known marksman.  Ms. Oakley married this gentleman and was an assistant to him during his traveling shooting acts.  Butler noticed Annie Oakley’s skill in shooting, and he later became her assistant and personal manager.  She joined Buffalo Bill’s Wild West show in 1885, and was in the show for seventeen years.  She won many awards for her work and skill in the show.  She was so incredibly skilled, in fact, that she could shoot a dime tossed in the air from a distance of ninety feet.  She even could hit the edge of a playing card from ninety feet away and shoot it five to six more times as it fell to the ground.  That inspired the term “Annie Oakleys,” which were free tickets to the shows with holes punched in them.

Her work was considered something of a man’s work, but she helped in changing the public's mind about appropriate sports and activities in which women could participate.  She worked to push women’s rights; one being the right to bear arms for sport and self-defense.  Annie opened shooting ranges and matches in the United States and Europe for women competitors.  She traveled along the east coast to demonstrate to World War I soldiers how to safely use firearms.  Annie left a legacy being the first female wild west star.  She demonstrated her immense skill in shooting and trapshooting through contests, wild west shows, and rodeos.

James Butler Hickok, more famously known as “Wild Bill,” was also a gifted shooter.  He was raised in a normal environment responsible with farm chores and expected to attend church every Sunday.  His parents; however, had a station for the Underground Railroad and helped smuggle slaves from the south.  He developed his interest in guns while he was fleeing with his father from officers who had accused them of carrying slaves in their stage coach.  He would practice at targets on the farm, but his father never really approved of his fantasies about the west.  Bill was known for his shooting, but he held many positions as a coach driver on the Sante Fe and Oregon Trails, peace officer, towpath driver, and Union army soldier.  Within his workings he met Bill Cody in Kansas who had Buffalo Bill’s Wild West show.  “Wild Bill” got his name when he broke up an angry bar mob by shooting a couple of shots overhead.  A woman praised him for this calling him “Wild Bill,” although she could have possibly mistaken him for someone else.  Mr. Hickok took an offer from his old friend Bill Cody to be in some of his wild west shows, but he eventually left these for other ventures.  He had developed a reputation from his shooting and relationships with other people.  Once, he entered into a saloon and joined a game of poker, which he had enjoyed many times with skill in his younger days.  Jack McCall, who had drunk plenty at that point, approached Bill and said, “Take that!”  Mr. McCall took a pistol and shot Bill in the back of the head killing him instantly.

== Railroads open the West ==

[[File:Theodore Judah.jpg|thumb|Theodore Judah (1826-1863), American businessman who co-founded the Central Pacific Railroad.]]

The railroads started construction in 1850 it to them till 1871. There was 170 million dollars put into the production of the railroad. The Central Pacific group got 10 square miles per every mile of track laid and the Union Pacific group got 20 square mile per every mile of track laid. The Central Pacific group started in Sacramento, California. The Union Pacific group started in Omaha, Nebraska. 

There was a variety of people working on the railroad there were war veterans, Irish, Chinese, African, and Mexicans did all the hard work. In 1869 both the groups had reached Utah. Now the East and West are forever linked.[http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist1/rail.html][http://www.linecamp.com/museums/americanwest/hubs/railroads_expanding_west/railroads_expanding_west.html][http://www.mrvanduyne.com/west/railroads10.htm]

In 1850 to 1871 the federal government put out huge land grants for laying the tracks to the West. These grants were 17 million acre areas worth about half a billion dollars. The two railroad companies were the Union Pacific going from Omaha to the west, and the Central pacific going east from Sacramento. These railways received 10 square miles of public land for every mile of track on state land. They also received 20 square miles of land for every mile of track in a territory. Civil War veterans, Irish and Chinese immigrants, African and Mexican Americans were the main labor force for cutting through the mountains on their way west. The Union Pacific Railway was responsible for cutting through the Rocky Mountains and connecting the United States forever more.  The railroad brought California to the rest of the country

When the railway was finally connected they sent a single word over telegraph, that word was “DONE”. The central pacific Railway was organized by a group of merchants, later called the “Big Four”, these men were Collis P. Huntington, Gov. Leland  Stanford, Mark Hopkins, and Charles Crocker. Dr. Daniel W. Strong surveyed a practical mountain path for the Railroad to take, the financial aspect was taken care of by Theodore Dehore Judah, an engineer, and Judah also won the federal support of Abraham Lincoln. The railroad cut a six month journey to a six day trip to the west and California. Most of the settlers in Nebraska, Minnesota, and Wisconsin were immigrants.

This project was set aside when the Civil War broke out. After the war, the companies sped to finish the railroad as quickly as possible, so they hire the immigrants, and African Americans who would work cheaply and quickly.

== Government Support for Settlement ==

President Abraham Lincoln passed the Homestead act on May 20, 1862. The Homestead Act was made to give power to all American citizens, even the poor. It gave 160 acres of surveyed public land after they payed a filing fee and 5 years of residence. It was supposed to get people to migrate to the west. Northern business men were opposed to it because it lowered property values. By 1900, the Homestead Act had filed 600,000 claims for 80 million acres.

Exodusters were African-American were slaves freed from the south. They lived in bad conditions. Most were people that got ripped off share cropping, and didn’t make enough money. Many of them went to Kansas because Kansas was trying to attract settlers. There they thought of possibilities of plenty of land, and bountiful crops. Many could not pay for the whole boat ride, so they would ride half of the way, and walk the rest. When they arrived the exodusters started churches, schools, and small businesses.[http://middle.usm.k12.wi.us/faculty/taft/unit5/westwebquest/exodusters/][http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/homestead-act/][http://www.nathankramer.com/settle/article/homestead.htm]

== The Closing of the Frontier ==

[[File:Frederick Jackson Turner.jpg|thumb|Frederick Jackson Turner]]

The superintendent of the US Census stated in 1890 that there was no longer a frontier line.  The frontier line was defined as &quot;a line beyond which the population was under two persons per square mile.&quot;

In 1893, Frederick Jackson Turner composed an essay entitled The Frontier in American History.  He stated that the frontier was what gave Americans their special character.  He also argued that the exploration and settlement of the frontier had formed character and defined values.  Western expansion is behind the optimism, independence, adaptability, ingenuity, and self reliance of the American people.  Some historians may argue that the government's role in the settlement of the West was what defined Americans.

With much of the wilderness in the West being for sale, some recognized the beauty of the untamed land.  Yellowstone was the first national park to be created.  One of many expeditions was the Washburn-Langford-Doane expedition in 1870.  This expedition mapped the area and made detailed observations about the land.  Yellowstone was officially created in 1872 in the states of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. [http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=184]

== Dugouts and Soddies ==

On the great plains, there were few trees to use for housing.  Therefore settlers often built soddies.  A soddie is made of slabs of sod, usually two feet long, one foot wide, and about six inches thick.  The walls were constructed by stacking the slabs atop one another.  The roofs were usually boards covered with sod.  If the sod was placed grass up, it would be less likely to erode, but mud would drip when it rained.  If the sod was placed grass down, the roof was less likely to leak.  The soddies were inexpensive, but difficult to maintain.  Vermin were abundant, the floor needed watering regularly, and the roof needed to be replaced annually.

Another housing option was the dugout.  A dugout was dug into the side of a hill and only needed one side to be built.  This wall could be built of stones, logs, or sod.  The roof was usually made of sod.  These houses were cool in the summer and easy to heat in the winter.  However, they were usually temporary because people and cattle could unknowingly wander onto the roof. [http://www.irwinator.com/126/wdoc99.htm][http://www.wyomingtalesandtrails.com/soddies.html]

== Women’s Work ==

Back in the day, when the Pilgrims just started settling on the Americas, women were admired for their work more than they are today. They worked so much harder to get what they needed. Day in and day out, they did almost as much work as what the man of the house did. Women now-a-days need to have the kind of determination that the women back then did. 

I would imagine they were never bored. There was always something that needed to be done. They typically were out working beside their husband. Some of the harder things that the women did, was plowing the land, planting and harvesting the crop and wheat. They also were in charge, you could say, of making everybody’s clothes. They would make then using Beef and Lamb hides. 

They deserve almost all of our respect. They set an amazing example as to how hard we should work to get what we need, instead of depending on someone else, or just on your husband to do all the work. The husband wasn’t the one who the family looked to for the income. Their was an equality between the husband and wife. We need to have that more now, or work towards that. [http://staff.washington.edu/cgiacomi/courses/english200/historicalbriefs/women.html][http://edhelper.com/ReadingComprehension_35_13.html][http://www.flowofhistory.com/readings-flowcharts/the-early-modern-era/the-industrial-revolution/fc114]

Women workers were basically super human they did everything, anywhere anytime. Women worked in the fields with the men, plowing the land and planting and harvesting the predominant crop, wheat.  farmed the animals, sheered sheep, even knew how to drive a team of horses. They carded wool to make clothes for their family,in addition they sewed quilts and shoes. They made soap and candles , At harvest time they canned fruits and vegetables, also while tending a large garden  Also skilled in doctoring from animal attacks to broken parts. Also sponsored churches and schools, encouraging to make the community stronger.[http://www.kindredtrails.com/Frontier-Women-Page2.html][http://www.campsilos.org/mod2/students/life4.shtml]
== Technical Support for Farmers ==

[[File:Plow.jpg|thumb|Steel Plow]]

John Deere invented the steel plow (1837), enabling to slice through hard soil. It also pulled more easily than any plow that had been tried before. Then, many other machines were invented soon after, like; Spring tooth harrow (1869), Grain drill to plant the seeds (1841), barbed wired fence (1874), and the corn binder (1878). All these inventions made farming and harvesting so much easier and more effective. In 1890 there were more than 900 manufacturers of farm equipment. In 1830, it took around 183 minutes to produce a bushel of grain, then in 1900, it took only 10 minutes. [http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blfarm.htm][http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blfarm1.htm][http://www.iptv.org/iowapathways/mypath.cfm?ounid=ob_000067]

The invention of farming equipment and other tools helped build technical support for the farmers on the prairie. The first piece of farm equipment was the steel plow. This was invented by John Deere. Its job was to break up the sod and thick root masses of the tall grasses the prairie had and it replaces the iron plow. They kept upgrading the pieces of farm equipment to make harvest easier. Later after the plow, Robert Hall McCormick invented a mechanical reaper. There were more than just these tools that made farming speedier. The spring-tooth harrow, to prepare the soil; the grain drill, to plant the seeds; barbed wire, to fence the land and keep animals in; and the corn binder. Having all of these pieces of equipment increased the farmers’ need for cash and commercial farming. As all these pieces made farming easier, the market for agricultural products spurs adoption of the improved technology which increased the farm production. By the 1900’s there were more than 900 pieces of manufactured farm equipment. Agricultural was becoming increasingly mechanized and commercialized.

== Agricultural Education ==

[[File:Justin Smith Morrill - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|left|Justin Smith Morrill]]
[[File:Jack Trice Stadium.jpg|thumb|Iowa was the first state in the nation to accept the provisions of the Morrill Act of 1862. Iowa subsequently designated Iowa State as the land-grant college on March 29, 1864.]]

The Federal Government supported farmers by financing agricultural education.  The Morrill Act of 1862 and 1890 gave states land to help finance agricultural schools.  Justin S. Morrill, a U.S. Representative from Vermont during the Civil War, helped lead the Act of 1862.  He supported legislation to make a national agricultural school, but President Buchanan vetoed it.  This was a setback.  On July 2, 1862, President Lincoln signed the first Morrill Land Grant Act. The Act would start a revolution in American education because it provided states with the funds they could use for many productive things.  

The Morrill Land Grant Act of 1890 helped with the formation of agricultural colleges and also was designed to bring better education for former slaves.  They couldn’t enter White colleges and universities to be educated.  This act led to the formation of 17 Black land grant colleges in the former Confederate states.  It had a consequence of supporting segregation in education based on racism.  The act called on states to allow free slaves to their colleges or to create new schools for accomplished students.

The Hatch Act of 1887 established agricultural evaluation stations to let farmers know about new expansion.  Agricultural researchers made grains for arid soil and techniques for dry eastern plains to flourish and become “the breadbasket of the nation.”  The Act attacked general unawareness of growing problems.  This helped make agricultural producers even more productive.  The Act’s funding has caused in a federal-state research connection that has removed the danger of hunger and the work of the existence of agriculture production.  The Hatch Act pretty much established agricultural evaluation stations in connection with the colleges that were established in several States.

== Farmers in Debt ==

Post Civil War farmers had many burdens, and those burdens really put a hurt on their wallets. There were many reasons why the farmers went into debt. Machinery was very expensive at this time, and they had to borrow just to buy a machine to get started farming. There were outstandingly high taxes, and the shipping costs were ridiculous. The railroad took advantage of farmers needing short trips, so they raised the price of a short trip ticket to the point that it was more expensive than the long trip tickets. These conditions really brought the farmers together. 

There were a few plans that the farmers had to try to get ahead in business. They used as much land as they could get their hands on, and when wheat was high, they didn’t have much of a problem repaying their debt. Many of these farmers found themselves growing as much as they could. These farms were called Bonanza Farms, and these farms had up to fifteen-thousand acres of one single crop. In one incident, there was twenty-four square miles of one crop in Casselton, North Dakota. In the 1880’s the plains got a drought much like that of the drought that happened around forty years later. Due to this extreme drought, Bonanza farms slowly started to die off and disappear. [http://www.lib.niu.edu/2000/ihy000228.html][http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/reconstruction/section3/section3_wfarmer.html][http://www.cliffsnotes.com/study_guide/The-Revolt-of-the-Farmers.topicArticleId-25238,articleId-25189.html]
== Economic Distress ==

[[File:Greenback.jpg|thumb|Greenback]]

The financial problems of the farmers were not only in one area of America, but in the nation as a whole. America wanted 500 million dollars worth of paper money during the Civil War. The paper money wasn’t worth as much as the hard money such as coins and paper money printed in yellow ink that could be exchanged for gold. After the war, greenbacks were out of circulation.

Taking the greenbacks out of circulation increased tension and it also increased the value of the money that was still in circulation. This means that if farmers borrowed money before, they would have to pay them back with money that has more value than it did before. Another problem was that they weren’t getting paid as much for their crops any more. For about 20 years, bushels of hay had to decreased from $2.00 to only $0.68   from 1867 to 1887. Farmers were losing money left and right.

In the 1870’s, farmers and people that were in debt kept asking the government to put more money into the circulation. The only result of that was the Bland- Allison Act of 1878 which meant that the government had to distribute 2 to 4 million dollars worth of silver each month. It wasn’t enough.

One thing that stayed strong were exports that were circulating throughout the South. From the production of tobacco along the James River to northeastern North Carolina to rice and indigo around many coastal swamps in the Carolinas and Georgia. After a while, cotton production started to grow slowly but surely.

== Problems with the Railroads ==

Building the railroad was a great thing, but had many problems that came along with it. Thousands of miles of available track were only in the Northeast and the South because the center of the country was still unsettled. They ran into a huge problem and that was mountains. They had to start on both sides and meet in the middle. There was not a lot of competition for the railroads, so the railroad cost was higher. The railroad workers made secret agreement with Middlemen which were grain brokers and merchants because the railroads were able to control the grain storage and the market prices. The workers that made these agreement got caught and had to work longer hours and were in more debt every year. 

The workers of these railroads were all different types of people. Most of the workers were Chinese, but there was some other immigrants as well. They may have been different races, but they all had one thing in common and that was they just wanted to work to be done. They were just doing the railroad to do it. They kept waiting for the whistle to blow saying that the railroad was complete and they could stop working. Because of this railroad, the West was a big interest. The railroad helped move people out there but also increased the force of moving Native Americans because it was easier to transport people now. So as you can see, the railroad was good and bad in many ways and with this great improvement on transportation came many problems.

== The Farmers’ Alliances ==

[[File:Kelley Oliver Hudson pic sig.jpg|thumb|Kelley Oliver Hudson pic sig]]

First started in Lampasas County, Texas. Farmers needed to organize to push for reforms. The Patrons of Husbandry was an organization started in 1867 by Oliver Kelley. From 1870 to the 1900‘s the agricultural exports were tripled.They were an organization called a Grange by the farmers. Its purpose was to create education and a social outlet for farm families. Once the 1870’s came around they mostly just fought the construction of the railroad. The starting of the Grange also started other organizations like the Farmers’ Alliances. All the groups tried to help farmers and educate them about the government, banks, loans and railroads. The people that spoke from town to town about these things were called Spellbinding’s. The movement grew to 4 million, which was mostly in the South and the west. Many of the farmers needed to know how to manage their funds in case a crop the next year didn’t come through. Like growing more than one kind of crop.[http://history.howstuffworks.com/american-history/farmers-alliances.htm][http://mshistory.k12.ms.us/articles/163/farmers-the-populist-party-and-mississippi-1870-1900][http://www.apstudynotes.org/us-history/topics/agrarian-revolt/]
== The Populist Party Platform ==

The Populists proposed an increase in the money supply, which would cause an increasing price of goods and service. the also had a proposal for a graduated income tax and a federal loan program. The Populists wanted an eight hour work day and restriction on immigration. Other opinions were that there should be a better national currency, Transportation should be owned and operated by the Government for the good of the people, and the land,including the natural resources, if owned by a person not from the United states should be reclaimed by the government to let settlers live there. 

The Populists won ten percent of the vote in 1892 Later on the Populist platform became the platform for the democratic party and kept alive the concept that the government is responsible for reformation of social injustices. [http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/111pop.html][http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h875.html][http://mshistory.k12.ms.us/articles/163/farmers-the-populist-party-and-mississippi-1870-1900]
The Populists otherwise known as the People’s Party was a short-time political party. It caused a increase in money supply which people started creating money that really had no value. There was a rise in prices and supplies. Drought then hit the area and caused it to go into depression. There was government reforms which were an election of U.S. Senators by popular vote, single terms for the president and vice-president, and a secret ballot to end vote fraud. The Populists wanted an eight-hour work day and restrictions on immigration. Many people liked this a lot. The Populists got almost 10% of total vote. The People’s Party elected 5 senators, 3 governors, and 1,500 state legislators. The Populists became the base or platform of the Democratic party and then the Populists Party mostly faded away.

== The Panic of 1893 ==
During the 1880s, farmers were over-burdened with debts and loans. Railroad construction had expanded faster than the markets, so, in February 1893, the Philadelphia and Reading Railroads went bankrupt. Soon after, the Erie, Northern Pacific, Union Pacific, and the Santa Fe went bankrupt. The government’s gold supply had worn thin, partly due to its obligation to purchase silver. People panicked and traded paper money for gold. At Wall Street, the stock prices dropped dramatically, which in turn caused the price of silver to plunge and the silver mines were forced to close. At the end of 1893, over 15,000 businesses and 500 banks had closed. The depression of the 1890s lasted until 1897. One response to the series of failures and bankruptcies was an upsurge in business consolidations. The poorer of the nation thought they had been ignored during the hard times and the were left at the mercy of the trusts. [http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h792.html] [http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=538] 

In the 1800s, many farmers were deep in dept. Construction on the railroads was expanding faster than markets. In 1893 the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad went bankrupt, followed by the Erie, the Northern Pacific, the Union Pacific, and the Santa Fe. People were trading paper money for gold. The price of silver went down and mines closed. By the end of the year, over 15,000 businesses and 500 banks closed. 3 million people lost there jobs.[http://florencekelley.northwestern.edu/historical/panic/][http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/whitten.panic.1893][http://www.historycentral.com/Industrialage/Panic1893.html][http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h792.html]

== Silver or Gold ==

[[File:Silver-nugget.jpg|thumb|left|Silver]]

[[File:The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, 006.png|thumb|The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, 006]]

Populists watched the two major parties divide and struggle between different regions and economic interests. The central issue was which metal would be the basis of the nation’s monetary system. The “silverites” who favored bimetallism, which was a monetary system in which the government would give citizens either gold or silver in the exchange for paper currency or checks. The “gold bugs” favored the gold standard, which was backing dollars solely with gold. This group also has President Cleveland in it.

The backing of currency was an important issue because people thought paper money was worthless if it could not be turned in for gold or silver. Silver was more plentiful than gold, backing the currency with both metals, would make more currency, (with less value per dollar) available. Supporters of bimetallism hoped that this measure would stimulate the stagnant economy. Retaining the gold standard would provide a more stable, but expensive, currency.

The Greenback party thought that paper money would be the solution. But during post war decades, ,the opening of vast silver veins had sharply increased the nations silver supply.  The silver ratio was 16 to 1 which was the moderate solution to the currency problem.  Bimetallism was the main topic of issue during the 1890’s and lasted into the late 19th century.  in 1896 and 1900 the gold standard defeated the silverites under William Jennings Bryan.

The gold standard in 1890-1908 was efficient, the number of gold violations was small. The actions of the Bank of England and U.S Treasury in manipulating gold points were consistent. [http://projects.vassar.edu/1896/currency.html][http://www.conservapedia.com/Bimetallism][http://www.jstor.org/pss/1833191]

== Bryan and the “Cross of Gold” ==

This started with the Populist Party calling for bimetallism and free coinage of silver. They couldn’t decide how they were going to approach this though. Would they join forces with sympathetic candidates in major parties and risk losing their political, or should they nominate their own candidates and risk losing the election?

As the 1896 campaign progressed the Republican Party committed to the gold standard which is using gold as the primary currency and nominated William McKinley for president because he supported this. The Democratic Party, however wanted the combined use of gold and silver and thus elected 36 year-old William Jennings Bryan and their representative running for presidency. Later on this is where Bryan would make his most famous speech called the “cross of gold speech.” This was also known as the most important speech in political history. It was delivered on July 9, 1896, in a convention in Chicago. He said this speech in intent to represent the broad population like farmers, small town merchants, and business men.[http://www.historicalvoices.org/earliest_voices/bryan.html][http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5354/][http://www.micheloud.com/FXM/MH/crime/crossof.htm]

== The End of Populism ==

In this chapter, William Jennings Bryan won the democratic nomination. Two weeks later, the delegates where both pleased and frustrated. They didn't like his idea called &quot;Cross of gold&quot;. This made Democrats nominate their own candidate.

In the national campaign, populists served as a symbol for republicans. They warned that the silver Democrats had allied themselves with ignorant &quot;hayseeds&quot;. Bryan ignored the people party, even though he was its nominee. [http://projects.vassar.edu/1896/populists.html][http://www.socialstudieshelp.com/Lesson_51_Notes.htm]

#Every datagraphic visualizes a relationship among the dimensions
#There is an appropriate visualization for every relationship
#The visualization should be efficiently designed
#The design should reveal the insight.

== Starting a new book ==

Easiest way to do it is to simply create a pointer to it, go to that pointer, and start writing.

For instance: Say I want to start a book on Fruitbats. In my sandbox, or on any other page, I create the link &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Fruitbats]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. I can then either save that page and click the link in the saved page, or click on the link in the preview. I am now editing the base of a hierarchy that will become a book.

A lot of people put project standards on the Talk page of the project root. It's also useful to use the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Bookcat}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template at the foot of each page to correctly categorize the book pages as being in the category of the book title.

      <comment>/* Frequency response of a single real pole */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">
==Design of continuous-time linear, time-invariant filters==
The student should already know how to characterize a linear, time-invariant system using:
* convolution,
* unit impulse response function, 
* transfer functions 
&amp; frequency response. 

This provides the basis to design linear time-invariant systems that can achieve specifications for particular purposes - which is what electrical engineers MUST be able to do.

Several things are key to going this: 
* know what a pole in the complex plane is 
* know what the zeros are 
* understand how these influence the frequency response of a system

===Reviewing poles and zeros in the complex plane === 
[[Image:Complex number illustration.svg|thumb|left|A complex number can be visually represented as a pair of numbers forming a vector on a diagram called an [[w:Argand diagram|Argand diagram]], representing the [[w:complex plane|complex plane]]. ''Re'' is the real axis, ''Im'' is the imaginary axis, and ''i'' is the square root of –1.]]

A '''complex number''' is a number consisting of a ''[[W:real number|real]]'' part and an ''[[W:imaginary number|imaginary]]'' part. Complex numbers extend the idea of the one-dimensional [[W:number line|number line]] to the two-dimensional [[W:COMPLEX PLANE|complex plane]] by using the number line for the real part and adding a vertical axis to plot the imaginary part. In this way the complex numbers [[W:subfield|contain]] the ordinary real numbers while extending them in order to solve problems that would be impossible with only real numbers.

Complex numbers are [[W:#Applications|used]] in many scientific fields, including electrical engineering, electromagnetism, most of physics included quantum physics, and applied mathematics.

Argand diagrams are frequently used to plot the positions of the [[w:pole (complex analysis)|poles]] and [[w:Zero (complex analysis)|zeroes]] of a [[w:mathematical function|math function]] in the complex plane.

====Poles in the complex plane  ====
[[Image:Gamma abs 3D.png|right|thumb|240px|The absolute value of the [[Gamma function]]. This shows that this function becomes infinite at the poles (left). On the right, the Gamma function does not have poles, it just increases quickly.]]

Let's review complex poles. In [[w:complex analysis|complex analysis]] (an isolated singularity is one that has no other singularities close to it), a '''pole''' of a [[w:meromorphic function|function]] is a '''[[w:mathematical singularity|singularity]]''' that behaves like the singularity of &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle \frac{1}{z^n} &lt;/math&gt; at ''z'' = 0. This means that any pole of the function ''f''(''z'') is a point ''a'' such that ''f''(''z'') '''[[w:Infinity#Complex_analysis|approaches infinity]]''' as ''z'' approaches ''a''.

* The function 

::&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac{3}{z}&lt;/math&gt; 

: has a pole of order 1 or simple pole at &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle z\, = \,0&lt;/math&gt;.

* The function 

:: &lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac{z+2}{(z-5)^2(z+7)^3}&lt;/math&gt;

: has a pole of order 2 at &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle z\, = \,5&lt;/math&gt; and a pole of order 3 at &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle z\, = \,-7&lt;/math&gt;.

* The function 

:: &lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac{z-4}{e^z-1}&lt;/math&gt;

: has poles of order 1 at &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle z\, = \,2\pi ni\text{ for } n\, = \,\dots,\, -1,\, 0,\, 1,\, \dots.&lt;/math&gt; To see that, it helps to write &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle e^z&lt;/math&gt; in [[w:Taylor series|Taylor series]] around the origin.

* The function 

::&lt;math&gt;f(z) = z&lt;/math&gt; 

: has a single pole at infinity of order 1.

*The [[w;cosecant|cosecant]] function &lt;math&gt;\csc \left(\pi z\right)&lt;/math&gt; has an isolated singularity at every integer.

====Complex plane zeros====
A complex number ''a'' is a '''simple zero''' of ''f'', or a '''zero of multiplicity 1''' of ''f'', if ''f'' can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;f(z)=(z-a)g(z)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''g'' is a [[w:holomorphic function|holomorphic function]] ''g'' such that ''g''(''a'') is not zero.

Generally, the '''[[w:multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]]''' of the zero of ''f'' at ''a'' is the positive integer ''n'' for which there is a holomorphic function ''g'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;f(z)=(z-a)^ng(z)\  \mbox{and}\ g(a)\neq 0.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The multiplicity of a zero ''a'' is also known as the '''order of vanishing''' of the function at ''a''.

The [[w:fundamental theorem of algebra|fundamental theorem of algebra]] concludes that every nonconstant [[w:polynomial|polynomial]] with complex coefficients has at least one zero in the [[w:complex plane|complex plane]].  This is in contrast to the situation with [[w:real number|real]] zeros: some polynomial functions with real coefficients have no real zeros.  

Consider the example  ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1. 
In this case x = ± i 

Consider the example  ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 1.
In this case x = ± 1

===Characterizing the frequency response === 
The frequency response is defined in terms of the magnitude response and the phase response. 

The magnitude is displayed using a log-log plot, expressed in decibels (dBs), which is given by 20 log10 {|H(jω)|}.

The phase response is usually expressed in either radians or degrees.

These examples yield dimensionless answers because they are relative ratios expressed in decibels.

*To calculate the ratio of 1&amp;nbsp;kW (one kilowatt, or 1000 watts) to 1 W in decibels, use the formula
:&lt;math&gt;
G_\mathrm{dB} = 10 \log_{10} \bigg(\frac{1000~\mathrm{W}}{1~\mathrm{W}}\bigg) \equiv 30~\mathrm{dB} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

*To calculate the ratio of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1000}~\mathrm{V} \approx 31.62~\mathrm{V}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;1~\mathrm{V}&lt;/math&gt; in decibels, use the formula
:&lt;math&gt;
G_\mathrm{dB} = 20 \log_{10} \bigg(\frac{31.62~\mathrm{V}}{1~\mathrm{V}}\bigg) \equiv 30~\mathrm{dB} \,
&lt;/math&gt;
Notice that &lt;math&gt;({31.62\,\mathrm{V}}/{1\,\mathrm{V}})^2 \approx {1\,\mathrm{kW}}/{1\,\mathrm{W}}&lt;/math&gt;, illustrating the consequence from the definitions above that &lt;math&gt;G_\mathrm{dB}&lt;/math&gt; has the same value, &lt;math&gt;30~\mathrm{dB}&lt;/math&gt;, regardless of whether it is obtained with the 10-log or 20-log rules; provided that in the specific system being considered power ratios are equal to amplitude ratios squared.

*To calculate the ratio of 1&amp;nbsp;mW (one milliwatt) to 10 W in decibels, use the formula
:&lt;math&gt;
G_\mathrm{dB} = 10 \log_{10} \bigg(\frac{0.001~\mathrm{W}}{10~\mathrm{W}}\bigg) \equiv -40~\mathrm{dB} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

*To find the power ratio corresponding to a 3 dB change in level, use the formula
:&lt;math&gt;
G = 10^\frac{3}{10} \times 1\ = 1.99526...  \approx 2 \,
&lt;/math&gt;

A change in power ratio by a factor of 10 is a 10 dB change. A change in power ratio by a factor of two is approximately a [[3dB-point|3 dB change]]. More precisely, the factor is 10&lt;sup&gt;3/10&lt;/sup&gt;, or 1.9953, about 0.24% different from exactly 2. Similarly, an increase of 3 dB implies an increase in voltage by a factor of approximately &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;, or about 1.41, an increase of 6 dB corresponds to approximately four times the power and twice the voltage, and so on. In exact terms the power ratio is 10&lt;sup&gt;6/10&lt;/sup&gt;, or about 3.9811, a relative error of about 0.5%.

&lt;br&gt;

====Response of a pure integrator====
Consider a pure integrator (effectively an RC circuit). It has a transfer function
&lt;math&gt; H(s) = {1 \over s} &lt;/math&gt;

Its frequency response is
&lt;math&gt; H({j \omega}) = {1 \over {j \omega}} &lt;/math&gt;


The magnitude response, expressed in terms of gain, is:
&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
G = | H(j\omega) | = \left|\frac{V_C(j \omega)}{V_{in}(j \omega)}\right|
&lt;/math&gt;


The magnitude response decreases by a decade (factor of ten) when the frequency increases by a decade. 

The magnitude response expressed in decibels decreases by 20 dB every decade.

:&lt;math&gt; |H(j\omega)| = {1 \over |j\omega|} &lt;/math&gt; 

and the phase angles are:

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi_R = \angle H(j \omega) =  \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\omega}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;.

====Response of a pure differentiator ====
The magnitude response of a pure differentiator with transfer function

:&lt;math&gt;H(s) = s &lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently, with frequency response

:&lt;math&gt;H(j\omega) = j\omega&lt;/math&gt;

===Frequency response of a single real pole === 

Let us consider a transfer function of the form

:&lt;math&gt;H(s) = {1 \over {1 + s\tau}} &lt;/math&gt;

An arbitrary transfer function of the form
˜H
(s) =
1
s + a
(7.8)
can be written as
˜H
(s) =
(1/a)
1 + (s/a)
(7.9)
such that H(s) and ˜H (s) are related through a scaling factor 1/a with τ = 1/a. Consequently,
if we know the magnitude response of ˆH (s) = 1/{1 + (s/a)}, we can express the log magnitude
response of ˜H(s) as
20 log10
{| ˜H (jω)|} = 20log10
{| ˆH (jω)|} + 20log10
{1/a} (7.10)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Concurrency encompasses a host of design issues, including communication among processes, sharing and competing for resources (such as memory, files, and I/O access), synchronization of the activities of multiple processes, and allocation of processor time to processes. If more than one thread exists in system at once, these threads can execute independently or in cooperation. 

The problems with concurrent execution can be expressed as follows:
* Concurrent processes (or threads) often need access to shared data and shared resources. 
* If there is no controlled access to shared data, it is possible to end up with an inconsistent view of this data.
* Maintaining data consistency requires mechanisms to ensure the orderly execution of cooperating processes.
* Race conditions may arise due to different order of the relative execution of various programs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Axonal Transport ==
[[File:Cytoplasmic_dynein.svg|thumb|A stylized depiction of dynein carrying cargo along a microtubule]]
Axonal transport, also called axoplasmic transport, is a cell process not only responsible to the movement of protein and membrane to its axon, but also responsible to the movement of molecules that destined for degradation from the axon back to the cell body. Movement toward the cell body is called retrograde transport; movement toward the synapse is called anterograde transport. 

Axonal transport is essential to neuron cell growth and survival. Axon of neuron is 1,000 or 10,000 times the length of the cell body, but contains no ribosomes, which means that it is unable to produce protein. All proteins and membrane must synthesis in neuronal cell body or neuron cell dendrite, and then transport to axon to support what axon needs. The motor proteins kinesin and dynein are mechanochemical enzymes using during anterograde process. 

Vesicular cargoes move 50-400 mm/day whereas proteins move less than 8 mm/day. The reason that the protein is slow is that protein pause frequently.

== Alzheimer’s Disease ==
==Introduction of Alzheimer’s Disease==
[[File:Alzheimer's_disease_brain_comparison.jpg|thumb|Combination of two brain diagrams in one for comparison. In the left normal brain, in the right brain of a person with Alzheimer's disease]]

Alzheimer's disease, also called AD, is a common form of dementia. The reason caused disease is unknown and there is no cure for disease. The patient will get worse as disease progresses, and eventually leads to death.5% 65-year-old people have Alzheimer's disease; 20% 85-year-old people have Alzheimer's disease- percentage of patients’ increases as patients’ age increases.

==Type==
There are 3 kinds of Alzheimer's disease:

1- Dementia AD, also called DAD, occupies 10% of patients. Most patients are younger than 65; some of them even younger than 40-year-old. Researchers find out that some patients have number 14-chromosome abnormalty, which doesn’t show on SDAT patients.

2- Senile dementia with Alzheimer's type, also called SDAT, occupies 85~90% of patients. Most patients are older than 60 years old. Research shows that SDAT is not hereditary. 

3- Familial AD, also called FAD, occupies 1% of patients. FAD is considered as hereditary disease, which is based on euchromosome heredity rules of Mendel. In the family of FAD, at least two generation of family members are diagnose as FAD. Most patients are younger than 40-year-old. The disease is barely affected by drugs.

==Diagnose==

==Characteristics==
There are four stages of the disease:

1- Pre-dementia: 

[[File:Auguste_D_aus_Marktbreit.jpg|thumb|Auguste Deter. Alois Alzheimer's patient in November 1901, first described patient with Alzheimer's Disease.]]

Patients will have mild cognitive difficulties. The test can help doctor to find Alzheimer's disease symbols existing eight years before diagnosis of AD. These symbols, such as short memory loss and inability to acquire new information, will cause patients cannot finish complex living activity independently.

2- Early: 

Defined as first 2~3 years, patients will have difficulties with language, executive functions, perception, or execution of movements. Language problem shows obviously in decreased word fluency and shrinking vocabulary, eventually leads to general oral and written impoverishment in language. Memory losing happens as same time, but less prominent than other symbols. Alzheimer's disease doesn’t affect all memory, such as implicit memory, episodic memory and semantic memory.

3- Moderate:

Disease will eventually hinder independence; patients will lose common living abilities. On language perspective, patients are unable to recall the vocabulary, leading incorrect word substitution. Reading and writing skills are also reducing progressively. Memory problem get worse; some patients even cannot recognize close relatives. Emotion changes dramatically, leading to wandering, crying and resistance to caregiving.

4- Advanced:

This is the last stage of Alzheimer's disease. The MMSE will drop 3~4 points every year until it goes to zero. Normally, patients can still live for 8~9 years, but most patients are already lost the living ability - all of their living activities are relied on other people. Their vocabularies reduce to simple phrases; sometimes they can only speak single word. Patients will dead eventually, but the reason caused patients dead is not Alzheimer's disease - is actually some external factors, such as infection of pressure ulcers or pneumonia.

==Causation==
There are several reasons that may cause Alzheimer’s Disease:
[[File:20100422_235222_Cyanobacteria.jpg|thumb|Oscillatoria sp]]
1- Heredity

Research report shows that more than 20% 80-year-old people have Alzheimer’s Disease. However, in the Alzheimer’s Disease family, more percentage of patients is observed; the age of having Alzheimer’s Disease even reduces to 13-year-old.

2- Cyanobacteria

Cyanobacteria contain neurotoxin named BMAA(β-N-methylamino-L-alanine). BMAA was verified that is strongly poisonous to animal nerve cells, increasing the speed of deterioration of animal brain cells. Accumulation of small amounts of BMAA can kill all brain nerve cells of rat.

3- Aluminum

Over-absorbing Aluminum ions is considered as the reason that may cause Alzheimer’s Disease. The research report shows that after the World War II, soldiers left on the Territory of Guam had high percentage of Alzheimer’s Disease. The high concentration of Aluminum ions was detected in the underground water of the Territory of Guam. After changing the drinking water for soldiers, the percentage of having Alzheimer’s Disease drops dramatically.

==Treating and Drugs==
There are three drugs that used to treat Alzheimer’s Disease. The first two drugs are already approved by FDA and used in clinical. The third one is still in testing period.  

1- Anti-acetylcholiesterase

Anti-acetylcholiesterase is used to treat patients who have early Alzheimer’s Disease. The drug changes patients’ emotion and psychotic symptoms. In order to treat accompany diseases, such as insomnia, doctors suggest that patients should take sleeping pills or other assistant pills with Anti-acetylcholiesterase at same time.

[[File:Honoré_Daumier_032.jpg|thumb|Intellectual activities such as playing chess or regular social interaction have been linked to a reduced risk of AD in epidemiological studies, although no causal relationship has been found.]]

2- Memantine(Namenda)

By stopping excitotoxicity of Glutamic acid, Memantine can stop the destruction of brain cells caused by Glutamic acid, which reduces the speed of losing living ability. Memantine is the only drug that can treat moderate and advanced Alzheimer’s Disease. 

3- bFGF

Research report shows that bFGF is useful to treat rats that have Alzheimer’s Disease, but there is no clinical report supporting that bFGF has positive effect on human body.

==Prevention==
There is no evidence to support that any particular behavior is effective to preventing Alzheimer’s Disease. However, researches show that changing a few modifiable factors, such as diet, intellectual activities, and living speed, can reduce the chance of getting Alzheimer’s Disease. On diet, people should eat more vegetable and decrease times of eating meat. And intellectual activities, such as reading, playing board games, completing crossword puzzles, and playing musical instruments, help to keep brain cells healthy.

      <comment>Added some information regarding TRP Ion channels on this previously blank page</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels get their name from a ''Drosophila'' phototransduction mutant that show a transient instead of a sustained response to bright light. In addition to responses to light, TRPs mediate responses to nerve growth factor, pheromones, olfaction, mechanical, chemical, temperature, pH, osmolarity, vasorelaxation of blood vessels, and metabolic stress. TRP-related ion channel proteins are found in a variety of organisms, tissues, and cell types, including nonexcitable, smooth muscle, and neuronal cells. TRP channels are recruited to diverse signaling pathways, such as gating mechanisms, regulation, and permeability.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Geothermal energy is a concept that utilizes the difference between the surface of the earth and subsurface temperatures in order to generate (usually) steam generated power. In some cases water is pumped down into the earth where is it converted to steam and that steam is recovered and used to drive turbines to make electricity. Geothermal energy generation is a highly stable and low risk clean energy option. Some people believe that a geothermal grid is both the simplest and safest option for providing a clean global power solution as it is more reliable and efficient than a number of other clean energy technologies. It has been calculated that there is enough geothermal energy available that it could potentially replace all other options, potentially nuclear also, as both a viable and consistent source of power generation. 

Using the earth as a heat source has advantages aside from being able to generate electricity:
*Heating for homes and offices.
*Heating water for pools, showers, etc.
*Thermal control of soils used for crop production.
*Drying materials such as timber and wool.
*Thermal control of water used for fish-farming.

Normally the energy used for such thermal control is generated from less renewable resources including coal &amp; gas power stations. Using geothermal energy simply for heating alone can save precious resources and allow for the freeing up some of the existing load on current energy grids.

===Geothermal Energy Generation Process===

; Binary-cycle plants 
: The most commonly used technology, are used when the source hydrothermal water is not hot enough to drive a generator. Heat is transferred from the hydrothermal water to another liquid that has a lower boiling point than that of water, generating vapor that can drive a turbine.

; Flash steam plants 
: These pull superheated water from deep below the surface into lower-pressure tanks to produce steam. They are most common in areas where high-temperature resources are available.

; Dry steam plants 
: These utilize geothermal steam directly.

Typical Process - Geothermal energy is converted for heating and electricity generation. 

:#The water is pumped down through a injection well where it flows through fractures in the hot rocks. 
:#It rises to the surface into a recovery well, from here it can be converted to steam.
:#A geothermal brine is combined with steam and transported from the recovery well(s) to a centralized separation station.
:#The steam / brine solution is separated and piped through these moisture separators to heat exchangers.(In the steam heat exchangers, the steam is cooled under pressure into condensate.)
:#At this stage the steam can be sent to steam turbines to make electricity. Waste steam is released through a steam exhaust.
:#The heat is then transferred to cold fresh water in condensate heat exchangers. The condensate cools down in the process to 20 degrees C.
:#Separated brine transfers heat to cold fresh water via specialized heat exchangers. (Geothermal brine is mineral-rich and causes scaling to coat the pipes in the heat exchanger. The solution to this is straightforward: steel particles are allowed to circulate in the stream, continually cleaning the pipes of any scaling buildup.)
:#Cold water is then pumped from wells to yet another storage tank.
:#From the storage tank, it is pumped to the heat exchangers where its temperature is increased.
:#It is then passed through deaerators where it is boiled at low vacuum pressure to remove dissolved oxygen and other gases that cause corrosion after being heated. This decrease in pressure cools the water in the process.

===Countries which presently use geothermal energy===
'''Brazil'''

'''China'''
China uses geothermal energy primarily for heating and not electricity generation.

'''Hawaii'''
There is one plant in Hawaii on Puna (the big island) and provides up to 30% if the island's power requirements.

'''Iceland'''
Iceland is perhaps the premier user of and leader in geothermal energy worldwide with up to 89% of it's heating and energy requirements being sourced geothermally. Natural hot springs in Iceland have been popular for centuries so it would appear that the Icelandic people have in fact been taking advantage of this natural resource for centuries. 

'''Italy'''

'''New Zealand'''

'''Phillipines'''

'''U.S.A'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
The internet has enabled great feats of collaboration. The ability to access vast databases with the click of a button or share volumes of information in an instant is one of the greatest accomplishments of the 20th Century. This connection, however, is not without a downside. There is abundant evidence that the internet encourages risky behavior by its users.  The ability to post anonymously to blogs and message boards removes a sense of accountability by the poster and can bring out more aggressive tendencies.  Additionally, social networking sites provide people with a community and establish a sense of trust between users, where risky behavior can appear to be more common and acceptable.  Finally, sites that display ratings and reviews for posted content encourage riskier behavior by rewarding images and videos of dangerous stunts with higher ratings.  The following three case studies illustrate the concept of web induced risk taking: internet anonymity, parkour, and planking.

== Internet Anonymity ==
Internet anonymity refers to websites that allow users to create [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_post anonymous posts] on discussion boards or webpages.  The user can often create a username or post under the generic username “anonymous”.  Websites like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan 4chan] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot Slashdot] are examples of sites that enable anonymous postings.  These postings can be legally traced to the user through [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ip_address IP address] information collected by the website, but with the use of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymizer Anonymizer] programs, IP information becomes virtually undetectable&lt;ref&gt;About Anonymizer. (2011). Retrieved from Anonymizer, Inc. website: http://www.anonymizer.com/company/&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Controversy ===
On some anonymous message boards, users post vulgar or defamatory comments.  College gossip sites [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juicycampus JuicyCampus] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_ACB College ACB] have garnered attention from college officials because of the harmful nature of the posts, with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepperdine_University Pepperdine University] chief information officer stating JuicyCampus to be a “’virtual bathroom wall’ for abusive, degrading, and hateful speech.”&lt;ref&gt;Young, J.

Retrieved from American Medical News website: http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2011/07/11/prl20711.htm  &lt;/ref&gt;.  4chan’s “Random” board has received a bounty of media attention because of the content of the site.  It is a place where users have, as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_post ''The Washington Post''] writes, “managed to pull off some of the highest-profile collective actions in the history of the Internet,” such as causing a sharp decline of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.

Proponents of 4chan state that anonymous posting is an expression of the freedom of speech.  In defense of anonymous posting and 4chan, Wendy Seltzer, one of Harvard University’s fellows at the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkman_Center_for_Internet_and_Society Berkman Center for Internet and Society], states, “The Internet needs some of these unstructured spaces… This may be a reaction against other places that have developed that say, ‘This is what you use Facebook for, this is what you use LinkedIn for.’” &lt;ref name=&quot;first&quot; /&gt;

=== Legality ===
According to federal law, owners of websites cannot be held liable for the comments of user posts&lt;ref&gt;47 U.S.C. § 230, http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode47/usc_sec_47_00000230----000-.html. &lt;/ref&gt;.  In this way, web sites that allow posting are able to continue operation.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_amendment First amendment] rights and other laws enable users to post anonymously&lt;ref&gt;Bill of Rights. (n.d.). Retrieved from Cornell University Law School website: http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;McIntyre v.

In order to identify a user from their IP address, all parties involved must comply with the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Communications_Privacy_Act Electronic Communications Privacy Act], and in many cases a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpeona subpoena] is required for the submission of an IP address location to authorities&lt;ref&gt;18 U.S.C. § 2703, http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/2703.html.&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Risk Taking ===
By posting anonymously, many users find it possible to post something that would not be deemed socially acceptable at work or in a public setting.  Because of anonymous posting through the internet, users cannot tangibly realize the consequences of their actions, and this disconnect removes a sense of accountability from the commenter&lt;ref name=&quot;first&quot; /&gt;.  Furthermore, as is commonly found in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink groupthink] phenomena studies, groups of people adhere to more aggressive and extreme risk taking profiles than any of the individuals would by themselves&lt;ref&gt;Yechiam, E., Druyan, M., &amp; Technion, E.

Retrieved from http://journal.sjdm.org/8530/jdm8530.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  Sites like 4chan, with over 11 million unique visitors per month and 150,000 to 200,000 posts on the “Random” board per day, enable this kind of behavior because of anonymous posting and groupthink behavior as well as the sheer volume of users, which facilitates this groupthink risk-taking profile&lt;ref name=&quot;first&quot; /&gt;.

== Parkour ==
=== History ===
One case that presents an interesting story of web induced risk taking is that of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour Parkour], or ‘street running’. The activity, as practiced in modern culture, was created in the 1980s by David Belle and Sebastian Foucan &lt;ref name = &quot;background&quot;&gt;''History of parkour''. (2011). Retrieved from http://www.wfpf.com/history-of-parkour.&lt;/ref&gt;. It stems from a training discipline called &quot;the natural method&quot;, which was developed by a French soldier named George Herbert in the early 1900s as a way to train people to move through their surroundings as effectively as possible &lt;ref name = &quot;background&quot; /&gt;. Participants rely purely on their own athleticism and daring to complete the activity: moving from point A to point B in the most interesting way possible &lt;ref name = &quot;background&quot; /&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Parkour was popularized in the early 2000s when the founders began participating in movies and videos to inspire interest in the sport. It was given massive worldwide exposure when the 2006 James Bond film &quot;Casino Royale&quot; showcased the skills of Sebastian Foucan (the founder plays a villain during a chase scene in the opening minutes of the movie) &lt;ref name = &quot;background&quot; /&gt;. Participation expanded due to these media portrayals, and especially due to internet videos and the notoriety street runners were able to gain by posting videos to the popular website [http://www.youtube.com Youtube]. Since the activity requires no expensive equipment, anyone with the conditioning, strength, and courage to attempt the sport can engage in the activity.

=== Evidence of Risk ===
Parkour is inherently risky, and there have been many reported injuries along with several deaths. In 2009, a 15 year old high school student died after falling from a parking structure in Sacramento, CA; friends and family suspected parkour as the only reasonable explanation for the event because of the teen's interest in the sport &lt;ref name = &quot;student&quot;&gt; ''Parkour investigated in teen's death''. (2009, November 09). Sacramento news: KCRA. Retrieved from http://www.kcra.com/r/21503335/detail.html &lt;/ref&gt;.Time Magazine ran an article 2007 discussing the ‘street running’ craze on college campuses &lt;ref name = &quot;Time&quot;&gt; Rawe, J. (2011, April 05). ''Student stuntmen''. Retrieved from http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1607235,00.html &lt;/ref&gt;. The magazine reported another falling death - a student at the University of Illinois - that was attributed to parkour &lt;ref name = &quot;Time&quot; /&gt;. It also cited the number of insurance claims filed by the colleges of injured students as an indicator of how dangerous the activity can be &lt;ref name = &quot;Time&quot; /&gt;.

=== Social Groups ===
Despite the associated injuries and risks, websites devoted to discussing and promoting parkour are abundant; sites such as American Parkour Forums &lt;ref name = &quot;APK&quot;&gt; ''American parkour''. (2011). copyright: Simple Machines. Retrieved from http://www.americanparkour.com/smf/index.php &lt;/ref&gt;, Bay Area Parkour &lt;ref name = &quot;BAPK&quot;&gt; ''Bay area parkour''. (2011). Created by SafeNSure. Retrieved from http://www.baparkour.com/ &lt;/ref&gt;, Parkour South Africa &lt;ref name = &quot;PKSA&quot;&gt; ''Parkour: South Africa''.(2011). copyright: phpBB. Retrieved from http://www.parkour.co.za &lt;/ref&gt;, and Worldwide Jam &lt;ref name = &quot;WWJ&quot;&gt; ''Worldwide jam''. (2011). copyright: Worldwide JAM. Retrieved from http://www.worldwidejam.tv &lt;/ref&gt; are just a few examples. While the target audience of each may be different, they all advertise the aspects of the sport and try to attract new participants by describing the health benefits of the workouts, the adrenaline rush achieved, etc. &lt;ref name = &quot;About_WWJ&quot;&gt; ''About parkour''. (2007). copyright: Worldwide JAM. Retrieved from http://www.worldwidejam.tv/about.jam.parkour.html &lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
In addition to touting the benefits of parkour, these social groups will often address the reports of participant injury. The general message is that while it is an inherently risky sport, injuries are not as prevalent as one might expect - that the injury rate is, in fact, lower than that of many other &quot;extreme sports&quot; &lt;ref name = &quot;Injury&quot;&gt; ''Parkour primer: Injury in parkour''.(2011). copyright: Parkour Dot Com. Retrieved from http://www.parkour.com/parkour-dojo/parkour-primer/#Injury &lt;/ref&gt;. Several sites also assert that risk of injury is mitigated by proper training, &lt;ref name = &quot;Injury&quot;/&gt; &lt;ref name = &quot;Safety&quot;&gt; ''Safety and parkour''. (2007, September 20). Parkour north america. Retrieved from http://parkournorthamerica.com/plugins/pdf/pdf.php?plugin:content.18 &lt;/ref&gt;, and then proceed to describe how to undertake some of the most dangerous stunts in the free running catalog &lt;ref name = &quot;Safety&quot;/&gt;. Articles and forums with this type of content are able to convince some readers that as long as they follow the strategy detailed online they won't come to harm, when this may not in fact be the case. This  is allows people to join an exciting community with the perception that there is minimal associated risk.

== Planking ==
=== History ===
Planking is a variation of the “Lying Down Game,” a mass-participation game that was invented in the UK in 2000.  To play the game, people lie face down with their arms rigidly at their sides and get someone to take their picture to be uploaded online.  It was referred to as planking in Australia because participants resembled planks, and became popular as local radio stations held competitions for the most unique and interesting planking locations&lt;ref&gt;''The origins of the &quot;planking fad&quot;''. (2011). Retrieved December 5, 2011, from http://amog.com/lifestyle/101398-origins-planking-fad/&lt;/ref&gt;.  The game gained momentum in the media in March, 2011, when David “Wolfman” Williams planked after scoring in a televised rugby game&lt;ref&gt;''Despite deaths and injuries, internet 'planking' fad continues''. (2011). Retrieved December 5, 2011, from http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/05/20/despite-deaths-injuries-internet-planking-fad-continues/&lt;/ref&gt;.  People began competing on blogs and social networking sites, and as more people participated the game transformed to encourage riskier and more dangerous planking locations.  Photos emerged depicting people on police cars, railway tracks, and industrial machinery.  Finally on May 15, 2011, Acton Beale fell to his death while attempting a planking stunt on a seventh-floor balcony in Australia.  This became the first planking-related death, and it revealed just how dangerous the popular internet fad had become&lt;ref&gt;Millian, M. (2011). '''Planking' death puts spotlight on bizarre web craze''. Retrieved December 5, 2011, from http://articles.cnn.com/2011-05-18/tech/planking.internet.craze_1_facebook-group-australian-man-photos?_s=PM:TECH&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Social Networking Sites ===
Social networking sites, such as Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter, are major contributors to the widespread popularity of the planking phenomenon.  These sites provide communities where people can interact and develop relationships with one another.  Besides connecting with family, friends, and peers, users of similar interests can come together to share ideas, pictures, and video content over the web.  The Planking page on Facebook boasts over 700,000 members who comment on and rate each other’s images&lt;ref&gt;''Planking''. (2011). Retrieved December 5, 2011, from http://www.facebook.com/OfficialPlanking&lt;/ref&gt;.  However, studies show that teenagers who spend over 3 hours a day on social networking sites are 60-80% more likely to have tried smoking, binge drinking, or illicit drugs&lt;ref&gt;Evangelista, B. (2011). ''Facebook may raise risk of teen substance abuse''. Retrieved December 5, 2011, from http://articles.sfgate.com/2011-08-25/business/29925481_1_substance-abuse-social-networking-teen-mom&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''OMG! excessive texting tied to risky teen behaviors''. (2010). Retrieved December 5, 2011, from http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/childrens-health/articles/2010/11/09/omg-excessive-texting-tied-to-risky-teen-behaviors&lt;/ref&gt;.  People who spend more time on these websites are more likely to see pictures or videos of their friends engaging in dangerous behaviors.  Activities such as drinking, smoking, and even planking begin to seem common and normal, resulting in users of social networking sites to feel more comfortable with taking those risks.

=== Easy Participation ===
It is becoming easier and easier for people to participate in internet fads such as planking.  A survey of wireless carriers in 2010 revealed that about 91 percent of Americans use cell phones, and most of these phones are equipped with a camera&lt;ref&gt;Foresman, C. (2011). ''Wireless survey: 91% of americans use cell phones''. Retrieved December 5, 2011, from http://arstechnica.com/telecom/news/2010/03/wireless-survey-91-of-americans-have-cell-phones.ars&lt;/ref&gt;.  Additionally, over 78 percent of the U.S. populace has immediate access to the internet&lt;ref&gt;''Top 20 countries with the highest number of internet users''. (2010). Retrieved December 5, 2011, from http://www.internetworldstats.com/top20.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, making planking an easy and convenient game to play no matter the time or place.

=== Reward/Competition ===
Social websites such as Facebook and YouTube feature systems where users can rate the submitted content.  Facebook provides a “Like” button that users can click to show their friends and family that they endorse a particular submission or comment&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, J. (2011). ''Facebook's &quot;like button problem&quot;''. Retrieved December 5, 2011, from http://hotair.com/archives/2011/09/22/facebooks-like-button-problem/&lt;/ref&gt;.  YouTube allows users to anonymously “thumbs up” or “thumbs down” content, and even displays the number of hits to a particular video submission.  These features encourage competition – friends and anonymous users can contend to get the most hits or the highest ratings for their content.  Thus, people are rewarded for taking riskier planking photographs because those are the ones that receive the best feedback and obtain the highest ratings.

== Conclusions ==
The internet age has allowed for the mass connection of people across the globe. Even when activities may involve serious risks, the idea that participating will make you a member of a larger group is extremely alluring. As seen with the cases of web forums, Youtube, Facebook, internet clubs, etc., possible negative consequences are often outweighed by social factors. Whether it's the belief that accountability can be evaded through anonymous posting, the assurance that internet instructions will keep you safe from harm, or the promise of a reward in the form of popularity, people are influenced by the internet to take unnecessary risks everyday.

&lt;/small&gt;
 

&lt;small&gt;Football ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soccer soccer]) is a sport that has so far resisted the use of high-tech support on and off-field. 


There is a range of new machineries developed to improve the game’s result and flow. A  wireless technology is already in use and can adjudicate on off-side decisions such as whether a ball passes over the goal line; clarify penalty decisions, replays on big screens and with an off-field referee interconnecting with the umpires on the field; as many other possibilities to make the game clear. 


However, FIFA’s decision of keeping technology away from the fields also has sustenance; the gaming can lose the characteristics and the World Game can suffer with changes and impacts still unknown, speculations arise the idea of threat the  [[Sport Innovation/Game’s Magic|Game’s Magic]].


While  [[Sport Innovation/On-field technology|on-field technologies]] are easier to control and be banned from fields,  [[Sport Innovation/Off-field technology|off-field interaction]] indicates a long way to be adapted and soccer is no longer different. The use of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media Social Media] for example is changing how supporters spectate the games and bringing place a more interactive communication channel.


Moreover, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting_of_sports_events Sport Broadcasting] suffered impacting changes in live and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_television Online Streaming] forcing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA FIFA] and the major sporting events to adapt themselves to a new way of showcasing the matches.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Algae''' refers to to a variety of species which live in water and often process sunlight, nutrients and carbon dioxide in order to survive. Some species produce hydrogen in the absence of sunlight while others due to their high lipid content can be harvested to produce up to 300 times more oil per acre than conventional crops. There is a limiting relationship between growth time and lipid content that at present hampers production capability. With Hydrogen production there are risks and hazards which have yet to be fully overcome.

;Pond farming
:As algae naturally grows in rivers, lakes, ponds and the ocean it can be harvested from these areas. Algae however are environmentally sensitive creatures and as such growth rates are strongly affected by external variables such as temperature, available sunlight, dissolved oxygen content, available nutrients, interspecies competition, pH and so on. Pond farming, or harvesting directly from nature, is therefore less reliable than a 'closed-loop' system where certain variables can be more carefully controlled. Open pond systems with monoculture algal production are also susceptible to viral infection.

;Closed Loop / Vertical Growth farming
:Algae are stacked vertically to maximize light exposure and nutrient delivery [Image:http://static.howstuffworks.com/gif/algae-biodiesel-5.jpg|frame|image-1]. Water is often recycled and thermally controlled. After the growth phase is exhausted the Algae are harvested and converted into oil. The remaining portion of the biomass not converted into oil can be recycled to some extent also [Image:http://static.howstuffworks.com/gif/algae-biodiesel-6.jpg|frame|image-2].

For those species which require light-free or oxygen-free environments different approaches might be needed to maximize production value.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===The Geology of Mercury===
Mercury exhibits some of the most unusual, and unique, geology in the solar system.
One of the most prominent features on Mercury is that of the enormous amounts of impact craters. There are a plethora of these smaller craters within larger craters. These features from the Highlands of Mercury.
There are smaller areas of Lowlands, which are areas that appear to have been flooded by lava at some point in Mercury's history - however, these are few and far between, and much smaller than that of the Lunar Maria. The prominent examples of Lowlands on Mercury are that of the Borealis Planitia, or &quot;Northern Plain&quot;, and the Caloris Planitia, or &quot;Hot Plain&quot;.
The Caloris Basin is the most prominent impact zone, covering approximately 800 miles (1,300 KM) of Mercury's surface. This collision was likely from some sort of solar debris that was approximately 90 miles across. The collision was so massive that it sent shockwaves across the entirety of Mercury's surface, resulting in &quot;weird terrain&quot; at the antipodal to the impact. This &quot;weird terrain&quot; is defined by depressions, hills and valleys that result from the wrinkling of the crust. The Caloris Impact likely occurred 3.85 billion years ago.
Some of the strangest terrain to be found on Mercury is that of the Rupes (or Scarps). These surface features are unique to Mercury, and can cut across entire craters. Where this occurs, the craters typically have shorter diameters perpendicular to the rupes rather than parallel to them. The favored theory for how these formed is that as Mercury's mantle cooled, the planet shrank, resulting in thrust faults to jut parts of the planet up (some up to 2.5 miles). Some rupes extend for hundreds of miles. The fact that the rupes cut through craters and have not been flooded by molten material suggest that they are likely some of the youngest features on Mercury.
70% of Mercury's mass is attributed to its enormous iron core, 25% can be attributed to its mantle, and the other 5% can be attributed to the crust. The core itself is as large as the moon, resulting in an unusually heavy planet. This was likely caused by an impact with another protoplanet, resulting in the ejection of much of the planet's initial mantle.
Only half of Mercury has been mapped to date.
===The Rarefied Atmosphere===
Mercury has a tenuous shell of gases that it either extracts from the Sun or receives from micrometeorite impacts. Other elements may leak from the surface from rocks or ice locked deep in craters.
Gases found in the atmosphere include: Oxygen (42%), Sodium (29%), Hydrogen (22%), Helium (6%), and Potassium &amp; other gases (1%).
The atmosphere is often blasted apart by solar wind and solar storms.

 convert to KrnAddInterrupt/KrnRemInterrupt, and irq.hidd is deprecated



==Introduction==

HIDD  API  is,  in  fact,  heavyweight.  You  need to open a HIDD library,  open  oop.library, instantiate an object (even if there's no object  in  fact, like in this case); and object calls are more costly then plain library calls.

* Object-oriented approach is good for implementing complex things, because  it  provides  code reuse. It's proven to be nice for graphics and PCI code. But what is IRQ handling? It's just lists, nothing more. You  either add or remove handlers, the rest is out of your control. 
* In fact the developer should not interact with &quot;IRQ number&quot; entity at  all. Our PCI API is incomplete, because it lacks &quot;Add interrupt  handler for the device&quot; method. Current approach works only on  PC-alike  machines,  with 1:1 relationship of PCI and system IRQs. 

For  example,  on  Amiga  there's  no such relationship. There all PCI devices  share  the  same  system  interrupt,  which  needs  to  be de-multiplexed  using  bridge-specific  code. Consequently, direct IRQ handling is needed only by: 

* lowlevel system components, like PCI driver itself.
* Non-autoconfigurable  devices  with  hardwired  IRQs  (PC  legacy devices). 

But doesn't this 'developer should not interact with &quot;IRQ number&quot;' make the KrnAddIRQHandler also wrong from 3rd party developers point of view? Shouldn't the function be moved to pci device object and have it talk with kernel?
A proper API would work in terms of &quot;events&quot; or &quot;messages&quot;. Interrupts would just be an implementation detail.
Or perhaps a signals-slots paradigm. There's some literature out there that compares the two approaches.


==Reference==

Having irq.hidd a thin wrapper over kernel.resource functions is a good think because it gives developers a cohesive interface to work against - always HIDD (irq, pci, graphics, etc). 
Don't  see  how  such  a  wrapper  can  be  useful,  IMHO  it  only over complicates things.

many places where struct Interrupt's is_Code is being called with different signatures: 
&lt;pre&gt;
rom/exec/intservers.c:
   IntServer expects intMask in D0 (instead of the correct D1)
   .. but calls is_Code without D1
   Interrupt Server: D0/D1 = undefined. Handler: D0 undefined, D1 = mask.

   VBlankServer expects intMask in D1
   .. and calls IntServer with it in D1.

SoftIntDispatch expects 5 arguments...
   .. but calls the chained interrupt with only 3..
&lt;/pre&gt;

.. and numerous places where drivers are setting up is_Code with functions with different calling signatures 
but they _should_ be called with the same calling sequence.

On stack-call architectures, the other problems mentioned may lead to bigger issues (different # of arguments).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Solar Photovoltaic cells convert sunlight directly into electricity. The name &quot;Photovoltaic&quot; comes from the process of converting photons (lights) to voltage (electricity), hence the name photovoltaic. This process is called PV effect. This process was first noted by a French physicist, Edmund Bequerel, in 1839, who found that certain materials would produce small amounts of electric current when exposed to light. This was later expanded by Albert Einstein who mathematically described photoelectric effect on which photovoltaic technology is based. The first photovoltaic module was built by Bell Laboratories in 1954 and its serious use began in the 1960s through space programs. Today, this technology is used to power not only  calculators, watches, and entire homes but also space satellites and the Mars rovers.

==How it works==
Solar cells are made out of silicon or other semiconductor materials also used in the microelectronics industry. Electrons are released from the atoms in the semiconductor material when light hits the solar cell. When the photon is re-absorbed by photovoltaic material it knocks an electron away from it's parent atom resulting in a change in charge on the atom. This void is filled by a new electron in order to balance the atom's valence returning it to it's more stable configuration. In an electrical circuit, where the electrical conductors are attached to the positive and negative sides, the electrons can be captured as electricity which can then be used.  
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;

[[File:Operation of a basic photovoltaic cell.gif|500px|center|thumb| A simple solar cell]]

&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
The following photovoltaic materials are currently used both terrestrially and on satellites and spacecraft:
;Crystaline Silicon :May be monocrystaline or polycrystaline in nature. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystalline_silicon c-Si]
;Cadmium telluride :Cadmium telluride ([http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CdTe CdTe]) is a crystalline substance generated in a reaction involving cadmium and tellurium. It is both a solar cell material and used as an infrared optical window. It is often layered with cadmium sulfide to make a photovoltaic solar cell that takes advantage of the p-n junction which the two materials form at the interface.
;Amorphous Silicon :[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorphous_silicon a-Si] has been used as a photovoltaic solar cell material for devices which require very little power, such as pocket calculators, improvements in a-Si construction techniques have made them more attractive for large-area solar cell use as well. Here their lower inherent efficiency is made up, at least partially, by their thinness - higher efficiencies can be reached by stacking several thin-film cells on top of each other, each one tuned to work well at a specific frequency of light. This approach is not applicable to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystalline_silicon c-Si] cells.
;Copper Indium Gallium Selenide :([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_indium_gallium_selenide CIGS]) is a semiconductor material which is a solid solution of copper indium selenide (often abbreviated &quot;CIS&quot;) and copper gallium selenide.
;Microcrystalline and Micromorphous Silicon :Microcrystalline silicon (known also as nanocrystalline silicon) is amorphous silicon it however contains small crystals thus absorbing a broader spectrum of light whilst adding structural flexibility.
;Organic photovoltaic cell :[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_solar_cell OPVC] use organic electronics--which deals with conductive organic polymers or small organic molecules to absorb light transport charge. The optical absorption capability of organic molecules is quite high, so a large number of photons can be absorbed with a small amount of material. OPVC are lower in efficiency, stability and strength when compared to their inorganic equivalents.
;A dye-sensitized solar cell :[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye-sensitized_solar_cell DSSC] is a low-cost thin film solar cell. It is a semiconducting material formed when a photo-sensitized anode and an electrolyte, a photoelectrochemical system are combined.
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;

[[File:Arraysolarcell.gif|500px|center|thumb| Multiple solar cells wired together and mounted on a frame form a photovoltaic module. Multiple modules wired together from an array. The larger the area of a module or array, the more sunlight it can capture. Therefore, larger area translates to more electricity produced.]]





== Advantages vs Disadvantages ==
The most obvious advantage is that solar energy is very plentiful and will never run out unlike fossil fuels. The 89,000 TW of sunlight reaching the Earth is about 6000 times more than 15 TW, the average power consumed by humans. It also has the highest power density among renewable energies. It is pollution free during use and once installed, it does not require any maintenance for several years so operating costs are extremely low after the initial set up. However, while it is pollution free during use, it does provide some pollution to manage end-wastes. However, this is nothing compared to the pollution caused by traditional means of generating power and can be managed through existing pollution controls and recycling. The obvious disadvantage to solar energy is that energy can only be produced during the day and its production can be drastically effected depending on weather conditions (cloudy, raining). While it is possible to store excess energy in the day and use it during the night, converting DC current to AC current does result in some energy loss.


==Future==
As many of our primary resources such as coal and oil used for energy are non-sustainable and disappearing fast, renewable energy is an attractive option that will grow as non-renewable energies become more and more scarce and renewable energy technology becomes more and more efficient and cheaper. Only a fraction of money invested in nuclear power is invested in solar panel so with more investment and time, there is definitely a big room for improvement. Considering there is about 6000 more times energy than our current consumption free to harvest, even if we can just get a tiny fraction of that energy, it will reduce our hunger for energy significantly

*  The stamps are grouped by appearance and function:
:: A - horizontal rectangle with truncated corners
:: B - rectangle with simulated perforation outer frame
:: C - rectangle with ornamental, Greek style outer border
:: D - rectangle with straight outer frame
:: E - open, horizontal frank, without outer frame
:: PO - special stamps generated only by post office machines
:: OO - special stamps generated only for official government mail

==History==
:''Wikipedia Article on the ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_wind_power ''History of Wind Power'']

Besides transportation, the earliest known use of wind as an energy source was its conversion to mechanical power in Persia sometime between 1000-200BC. The converter was a vertical axis windmill that turned a millstone, which ground grains for flour production. This design was later brought to Europe possibly by the Crusaders and windmill abundance increased dramatically in the 1200s.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=NcMws2-N3BMC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=Persia+and+the+Middle+East,+the+horizontal+axis+windmill+spread+across+the+Mediterranean%0Acountries+and+Central+Europe&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gKZf1qNjIm&amp;sig=75zpgLK9qmpTN7r8r_OaEM8WON0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GDfMTpXFPIqCtgeZwNFz&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=history&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; In 1888 Charles Brush designed and built the first wind turbine to generate electricity, which was stored in batteries for his household use.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=Mu6BBq3W4pQC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=charles+brush+wind&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nwbcTrG1D6bq0gGSsrjHDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=charles%20brush%20wind&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The system produced about 12KW and lasted about 20 years. In 1892 Danish scientist Dane Poul La Cour came up with the first modern design of the wind turbine based on the aerodynamic principles.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=o-5w_qVJG5wC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=paul+la+cour+first+wind&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cAfcTtW2POf30gG0ofjTDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=paul%20la%20cour%20first%20wind&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives to Electricity production==
[[Image:Bad_Gir_Yazd_Dolat_Abad.jpg|thumb|right|Badgir in Dolatabad Gardens, highest in the world at 34m, Yazd, Iran&lt;ref&gt;http://wreeec2011bali.com/uploads/files/Iran%20Traditional%20Architecture%20and%20the%20use%20of%20Wind%20(2).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Historically, wind has been used in non-electricity generating technologies such as the [[w:windcatcher|windcatcher]]. Windcatchers have been used for many centuries to create natural ventilation in buildings in central Iran. The structure directs wind down into the building and pulls air out of the building from the opposite side. Inside the building there is usually a pool or a decorating water fountain. The rapid evaporation of this water due to the very low air humidity of the area can significantly cool down the building and act as a natural air conditioning system.  Although windcatchers have long been forgotten to the extent that even people in Iran may not have heard of them, a comeback is possible. BBC reported a design of a zero emission home in 2007 claiming that it will set the environmental standards for all new homes in the future. One of the main components was a wind catcher for ventilation.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6735715.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits of Wind Energy==

While environmental pollution and the emission of [[w:carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide]] from the use of fossil fueld constitute a threat to health, the environment and sustainable economic growth, wind energy is a source of clean, non-polluting electricity. Wind turbines cause virtually no emissions during their operation and very little during their manufacture, installation, maintenance and removal. According to the [[w:U.S. Department of Energy|United States Department of Energy]], in 1990, California's wind power plants offset the emission of more than 2.5 billion pounds of carbon dioxide, and 15 million pounds of other pollutants that would have otherwise been produced.&lt;ref&gt;http://windeis.anl.gov/guide/basics/index.cfm &lt;/ref&gt; It would take a forest of 90 million to 175 million trees to provide the same air quality. Moreover, wind energy can provide incomes for rural areas.

By 2020, taking [[w:EWEA|European Wind Energy Association]] projections that 180GW of wind energy would be generating 425 TWh per annum&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enerverde.eu/cms/download/factsheet_environment2.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;, wind power will provide annual savings of:

• 215 million tonnes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

• 261,000 tonnes SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

• 333,000 tonnes NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Political Factors==
==='''United States'''===
Wind power is a new industry in the United States, so its public exposure has been limited. 
With increased interest in renewable energy, news outlets are featuring more stories about wind energy. Despite this increased media attention, a study conducted by researchers Klick and Smith (2010) polled 600 people about wind energy and found that public opinion is weak&lt;ref&gt;Holly Klick, Eric R.A.N. Smith, Public understanding of and support for wind power in the United States, Renewable Energy, Volume 35, Issue 7, July 2010, Pages 1585-1591, ISSN 0960-1481.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Wind power was part of the renewable energy platforms of the two major parties during the U.S. Presidential Elections in 2008 and 2012. The Democrats and the Republicans have recognized the potential of wind power as a form of clean energy, and in their 2008 election platforms, proposed government incentives and funding to increase renewable energies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=78545&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=78283&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, in 2012, the Democrats continued to maintain their ambitious agenda on renewable energies, including wind power, while Republicans, no longer incumbents, have reduced their renewable energy statement to a few sentences, which encourages continued renewable energy development, but in the market without taxpayer funding. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=101961&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=101962&lt;/ref&gt;
Since renewable energy is a growing political issue, wind power will continue to be featured in national energy debates. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.democrats.org/democratic-national-platform&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=101961&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Technical and Environmental Issues==
==='''Supply and Storage Issues'''===

The best option for wind is as distributed power&lt;ref&gt; http://ahec.org.in/links/International%20conference%20on%20SHP%20Kandy%20Srilanka%20All%20Details%5CPapers%5CPolicy,%20Investor%20&amp;%20Operational%20Aspects-C%5CC17.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;. Electricity generated from wind power can be highly variable at several different timescales: from hour to hour, daily, and seasonally. Wind also tends to be complementary to solar. This means that wind energy is  an intermittent technology that can be used only when resources are available. The intermittence of wind hinders the economic competitiveness of the resource, because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability.

==='''Cost Issues'''===

Even though the cost of wind power has decreased dramatically in the past 10 years, the technology requires a higher initial investment than fossil-fueled generators. Intermittency and the non-dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental operating reserve, and could require an increase in the already existing energy demand management, or storage solutions.&lt;ref&gt; ^ &quot;Claverton-Energy.com&quot;. Claverton-Energy.com. Retrieved 2011-12-02 &lt;/ref&gt;

==='''Wind Turbine Technological Challenges'''===

The engineering challenge for the wind industry is to design an efficient wind turbine to harness wind energy and turn it into electricity. The evolution of modern wind turbines is a story of engineering and scientific skill. In the last 20 years, turbines have increased in size by a factor of 100 (from 25 kW to 2500 kW and beyond), the cost of energy has reduced by a factor of more than five.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.wind-energy-the-facts.org/en/part-i-technology/chapter-3-wind-turbine-technology/ &lt;/ref&gt;

It is a big challenge to produce a wind turbine that&lt;ref&gt; http://www.wind-energy-the-facts.org/en/part-i-technology/chapter-3-wind-turbine-technology/the-technical-challenge-of-a-unique-technology/ &lt;/ref&gt;:

* Meets specifications (frequency, voltage, harmonic content) for standard electricity generation with each unit operating as an unattended power station;

* Copes with the variability of the wind;

* Competes economically with other energy sources.

* Stands high fatigue.


==='''Environmental Concerns'''===

Although wind power plants have relatively little impact on the environment compared to fossil fuel power plants, the environmental issues include how the turbines appear in a landscape, the sound they make and their effect on birds and other wildlife.

====Noise====

Like all mechanical systems, wind turbines produce some noise when they operate. In recent years, engineers have made design changes to reduce the noise from wind turbines. 

====Visual Impacts====

Because they must generally be sited in exposed places, wind turbines are often highly visible. They need to be in order to catch the prevailing wind and work effectively. Being visible is not necessarily the same as being intrusive. However, aesthetic issues are by their nature highly subjective. Proper siting decisions can help to avoid any aesthetic impacts to the landscape. 

====Avian/Bat Mortality====
Bird and bat deaths are one of the most controversial biological issues related to wind turbines. The deaths of birds and bats at wind farm sites have raised concerns by fish and wildlife agencies and conservation groups.

*''Measuring the Problem''
:The ''Wildlife Society Bulletin'' conducted a study in March of 2013 that &quot;estimated 888,000 bat and 573,000 bird fatalities/year&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wsb.260/abstract&lt;/ref&gt; occur as a result of wind turbines in the United States alone. To put this death toll in prospective, 970 million crash into buildings, 175 million crash into power lines, 72 million die from pesticides, and 1 million die from oil and gas spills&lt;ref&gt;http://www.livescience.com/41644-wind-energy-threat-to-birds-overblown.html&lt;/ref&gt;. 

*''Legislation''
:In November of 2013 the United States government ruled that Duke Energy Corp. would pay a one million dollar fine after pleading guilty to killing 14 eagles and 149 other birds. This marked the first time in US history that government enforced environmental laws protecting birds from wind turbine farms&lt;ref&gt;http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/11/22/21581139-eagle-deaths-at-wind-turbine-farm-duke-energy-agrees-to-pay-1-million&lt;/ref&gt;. This ruling may remain the only of its kind as the Obama administration announced just a few weeks later on the 6th of December that &quot;it will allow some companies to kill or injure bald and golden eagles for up to 30 years without penalty, an effort to spur development and investment in green energy while balancing its environmental consequences&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wcpo.com/news/national/following-duke-energy-ruling-on-eagle-deaths-us-extends-permit-for-killing-eagles&lt;/ref&gt;. This decision did not come without opposition as environmental groups worry that the free pass will spark an increase in the number of bird deaths rather than encourage efforts to develop a safer wind energy farms.

*''State of the Art''
:A number of prevention methods have been suggested to lessen the impact of wind turbines on avian and bat populations. Some of the techniques include painting turbine blades with black or UV paint, tracking flocks with radar, manually shutting down turbines when flocks approach, and building turbines around common flight paths. Research into these prevention techniques is in its early stages as researchers attempt to identify both why birds are colliding with the turbines, and how to reduce the rate of occurrence.

==Health Concerns==
''Wind Turbine Syndrome''
:It has been argued that wind turbines can have an impact on human health and quality of life. &quot;Wind Turbine Syndrome&quot; was first brought up as an issue by Dr. Nina Pierpont, an anti-wind energy activist. In her book self-published in 2009, she attributes symptoms including sleep deprivation, headaches, dizziness, anxiety, and vertigo to the infrasound and low-frequency noise generated by wind turbines&lt;ref&gt;http://www.windturbinesyndrome.com/&lt;/ref&gt;. Since Dr. Pierpont published her research farmers and townspeople from across the world have come forward claiming that do indeed suffer from these symptoms.  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.awea.org/learnabout/publications/upload/AWEA_and_CanWEA_Sound_White_Paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.windpoweringamerica.gov/pdfs/workshops/2010/webinar_mccunney_wind_turbines_health_effects_presentation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Critics''
:Proponents of wind energy such as the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) and the US Department of Energy have countered these claims by citing studies that correlate these symptoms to annoyance and stress rather than physical health impacts.  Critics also note that Pierpont did not use a valid sample size, she did not see her subjects in person, her work was not properly peer reviewed, and there were no recorded complaints prior to her study&lt;ref&gt;http://checksandbalancesproject.org/2011/06/10/nina-pierpont/&lt;/ref&gt;. This implies that until further research is done into the phenomenon, &quot;Wind Turbine Syndrome&quot; cannot be used as the sole reason to impede wind farm construction. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.windpoweringamerica.gov/pdfs/workshops/2010/webinar_mccunney_wind_turbines_health_effects_presentation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
''Other Causes''
:Shadow flickering has also been identified as a potential problem for those living close to wind turbines. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.aweo.org/windlincoln.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, minimum setback distances can be implemented to prevent this.

==Public Attitudes==
National opinion towards wind energy have been positive as the United States attempts to reduce carbon emissions through the increasing use of alternative, cleaner sources. A survey conducted by the American Wind Energy Association in March 2010 noted that 89% of American voters believed the nation should increase usage of wind energy. Additionally, 77% supported the implementation of a national Renewal Energy Standard (RES) that would mandate the amount of energy obtained through renewable sources.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.awea.org/newsroom/releases/04-22-10_Poll_Shows_Wind_Works_for_Americans.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Nimbyism===
:''Wikipedia Article on ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY ''NIMBYism'']

Despite overwhelming support for the United States to switch to more renewable energy, the installment of wind energy technology across the nation continues to face strong opposition by people living near proposed sites. Local opposition towards wind energy can be described by an attitude known as NIMBY (not in my backyard). Nimbies are people who oppose an issue due the proximity of this issue to them, or who support a cause (e.g. wind energy), but do not want it to require any sacrifices on their part, much like a free rider. 

For wind energy, these sacrifices may include the aforementioned issues in addition to other ones pertaining only to citizens living in the near vicinity to proposed wind turbines. Consistent with risk perception, studies have supported that persons living close to the site of a ''proposed'' wind farm particularly oppose wind farms due to a linear relationship between distance and risk perception. Similarly, people further away from an ''existing'' wind farm oppose further wind development due a lack of local experience to alleviate risk as seen in the below figure. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2006.12.012&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Public Opinion near Black Hill (BH) Vs. Public Opinion near Dun Law (DL).png|thumb|Adapted from Figure 1 in van der Horst. 2007: NIMBY or not? Exploring the relevance of location and the politics of voiced opinions in renewable energy siting controversies. based on data from Warren et al. 2005: Green on green: public perceptions of wind power in Scotland and Ireland]]
Due to the disputed medical legitimacy of Wind Turbine Syndrome, it has been suggested that WTS was conceived by Nimbies to support their opposition to wind power development near their homes.

====Examples====

====Cape Wind====

[[w:Cape Wind|Cape Wind]], an approved offshore wind project located near Cape Cod, was initially proposed in 2001 by Jim Gordon and his company [http://www.capewind.org/index.php Cape Wind Associates], the project would entail the installation of 130 wind turbines in a shallow, high-wind region of the Nantucket Sound known as Horseshoe Shoal. The company claims that the wind farm would be capable of supplying 75% of the electricity necessary for the Cape and the Islands. 

Following its proposal, [http://www.saveoursound.org/ the Alliance to Protect the Nantucket Sound] was founded. As classic Nimbies, this group believes that the Cape Wind project has the right idea, but the wrong location. They believe that Cape Wind would be detrimental to wildlife, the economy, public safety and the scenery. Two computer generated simulations of what the proposed wind farm would look like from shore show how opposing groups can use images to affect human perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capewind.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Sections&amp;file=index&amp;req=viewarticle&amp;artid=9&amp;page=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saveoursound.org/cape_wind_threats/view/&lt;/ref&gt; Although the two images are from locations the same distance away from where Cape Wind would be, it is obvious that the subtle differences are meant to persuade the viewer one way or the other. In addition to images, both groups support their arguments with what they claim are facts. These facts are then labeled as myths by the opposing side. Some of the most heavily debated issues are the price of the electricity, the effect on marine life and the visibility of the turbines on the horizon.

Coverage of Cape Wind has not only been limited to local news and blogs, but has also been in the form of popular media. ''Cape Wind: Money, Celebrity, Energy, Class, Politics, and the Battle for Our Energy Future'' was written by Robert Whitcomb and Wendy Williams in 2008. An unreleased documentary named [http://www.capespin.com/ Cape Spin] has also been produced.

====Donald Trump====
=====Golf Course Development=====
In early 2006, Donald Trump purchased the private Menie Estate, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balmedie Balmedie], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeenshire Aberdeenshire], Scotland with the hopes of establishing a premier flasgship [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Links_(golf) links-style] golf course as a part of a larger 1.6 billion dollar &quot;resort featuring a second golf course, a hotel, luxury holiday homes and a residential village.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/10/sport/golf/donald-trump-new-golf-course-in-scotland/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;


From the onset, construction of the new course and planned development has received both awe in the natural beauty and design of the course from golf enthusiasts around the world and vile from nearby residents over environmental concerns.
In May 2011, British filmmaker [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Baxter Anthony Baxter] released a documentary ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You've_Been_Trumped You've Been Trumped]'' negatively against several controversial actions Trump took in establishing the golf course, including obtaining a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_of_Special_Scientific_Interest Site of Special Scientific Interest] to expand the golf course. Since then, it has won 10 awards from film festivals and environmental documentary organizations, four-star movie reviews, critical acclaim by Michael Moore, Alec Baldwin and Scottish filmmaker Bill Forsyth, whose movie [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Hero ''Local Hero''] was cited in the film. While Trump tried unsuccessfully to stop its broadcast on BBC, the documentary received over 1.1 million viewers with high praise across the UK, leading to a second showing on BBC2. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/22/donald-trump-bbc-film-row&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Scotland Against Spin=====
======European Offshore Wind Development Centre======
Established in 2011, The [http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/917/0118802.pdf 2020 Routemap for Renewable Energy in Scotland] set a renewable energy target of 30% of all energy needs by 2020. Leveraging Scotland's offshore wind reserves, the Routemap details &quot;large scale development of offshore wind represents the biggest opportunity for sustainable economic growth in Scotland for a generation, potentially supporting up to 28,000 directly related jobs and a further 20,000 indirect jobs and generating up to £7 billion for the Scottish economy by 2020.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/917/0118802.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2013, Scotland approved a development test area 2 kilometers off the coast of Balmede in Aberdeen Bay to test the performance of new wind turbine designs to be used in future wind projects in Scotland.  
Scotland approved the new center for offshore wind developers and logistics-specialized companies to develop and test cutting edge technology in Aberdeen, bringing in high paying jobs to stimulate the local economy and support the creation of jobs in wind energy across Scotland. In addition to serving as a test development area, the European Offshore Wind Development Centre (EOWDC) is capable of generating power for nearly half of all homes in Aberdeen.

In October 2012&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20121003006477/en/Gaming-App-Approved-iOS-6-Wing-Whackers&lt;/ref&gt;, [http://www.techstudios.net/ Tech Studios] created an app called Wing Whackers to &quot;provide a fun and interactive way for children and adults of all ages to learn about birds, energy, and the environment while being able to actually support and save the lives of some of the world’s most amazing avian heroes.&quot; The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-scrolling_video_game side scrolling video game] features multiple characters &quot;heroes&quot; (an eagle, an owl, a bat, a pelican, a hawk) that a user has to guide through a series of obstacles (power lines and wind turbines) without falling into the clutches of animals &quot;nemeses&quot; on the ground (a snake, a shark, and a boar).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wingwhackers.com/our-mission/&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately following its debut, Donald Trump [https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/257882636381483008 tweeted] about the game as an attempt to spread awareness of potential negative effects of wind turbines to dissuade the EOWDC.

==Conclusions==
Several lessens can be learned from the social interface of the wind technology.
*''Technological path dependence.'' Technologies can progress and develop in one direction and that direction or path becomes the focus of future development, and alternatives struggle for relevance.
*''Feasibility of different technologies in different parts of the world.'' Not all technologies are suitable everywhere. Economic, cultural and geographical factors affect the implementation of technology. For example, wind turbines are economically feasible in windy places while windcatchers are only feasible in extremely low humidity climates.
*''NIMBY''. People may support an idea in general, but when its drawbacks directly affect them they oppose it. Most people make decisions based on incentives, prioritizing personal benefits over public benefits. Technologies that offer personal incentives thrive, even if they are detrimental to the environment. We see this all around the world as people or businesses make decision based on maximizing profits and ignoring the environmental effects. To be successful in saving the environment we must develop technologies that provide personal incentives as well as environmental benefits.

All healthcare providers and physicians depend on their [http://lytecmedicalbillingsoftware.com/#medical-billers medical billers] to get reimbursed for the services they provide to their patients. In a way, coders and billers help physicians with their livelihood.

Now with the Internet and with all of the insurance billing software out there many companies have been born that do medical coding and billing only.

&lt;br&gt;
==Annotations==
'''S'''{{spaces|5}}''Ulysses'' opens and closes with the serpentine letter ''S''. This has been compared to the figures of serpents in the ''[[w:Book of Kells|Book of Kells]]'' that have their tails in their mouths ([[w:ouroboros|ouroboros]]): ''Ulysses'' is a closed circle, ending where it began. In ''[[w:Finnegans Wake|Finnegans Wake]]'' Joyce achieved a similar effect by linking the opening and closing sentences of the book so that the former completes the latter.

Joyce was greatly influenced by the ''Book of Kells''. Referring to Edward Sullivan's ''The Book of Kells'' (a facsimile of some pages of the manuscript with a commentary), he once told his young Irish friend Arthur Power: &quot;In all the places I have been to, Rome, Zurich, Trieste, I have taken it about with me, and have pored over its workmanship for hours. It is the most purely Irish thing we have, and some of the big initial letters which swing right across a page have the essential character of a chapter of ''Ulysses''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=James Joyce |last=Ellmann |first=Richard |year=1982 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-281465-6 |page=545}}&lt;/ref&gt;


'''S'''{{spaces|5}}The three parts into which Joyce divides ''Ulysses'' open with significant letters:
:Part I (''The Telemachiad''): '''''S'''''
:Part II (''The Odyssey''): '''''M'''''
:Part III (''The Nostos''): '''''P'''''
These letters are the initials of the novel's three protagonists: ''S''tephen Dedalus, ''M''olly (Marion) Bloom and ''P''oldy (Leopold) Bloom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ulysses Annotated |last=Gifford |first=Don |coauthors=Robert J. Seidman |year=1988 |publisher=University of California Press |location=London |isbn=0-520-05639-6 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''S'', ''M'' and ''P'' are also significant in the context of Aristotelian logic. In a [[w:syllogism|syllogism]] there are three terms: the subject, the middle term and the predicate. These are conventionally represented by the letters ''S'', ''M'' and ''P'' respectively. In the original 1922 edition, Episode 17 (''Ithaca'') ended with a large black period, which was once used as a conventional sign for [[w:Q.E.D.|Q.E.D.]] at the end of a formal proof or demonstration. Thus ''Ulysses'' is a polemical work with a logical structure.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford, ''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;


'''Stately'''{{spaces|5}}For all his cynicism and neo-paganism, Buck Mulligan is identified as an upholder of church and state.


'''plump'''{{spaces|5}}(1) Fat, chubby. Joyce's principal model for Buck Mulligan, [[w:Oliver St. John Gogarty|Oliver St. John Gogarty]], was hardly ''plump''. Ellmann writes that when Joyce first met Gogarty in the National Library in 1903, Gogarty was &quot;handsome, lithe though inclined to fat, prosperous and merry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann, ''op. cit.'' 117.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904 Gogarty attended [[w:University of Oxford|Oxford]], where, in his own words, he &quot;became mentally and physically ''pinguis'' [Latin: ''fat'']&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Many Lines to Thee: Letters to G. K. A. Bell 1904-1907 |last=St John Gogarty |first=Oliver |editor=James F. Carens |year=1971 |publisher=Dolmen |location=Ireland |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether plump is an accurate description of Gogarty, there is no doubt that Joyce intended Buck Mulligan to be fat: in ''Oxen of the Sun'' ([[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Oxen_of_the_Sun/384|384.33-36]]), Dixon jocosely inquires whether Mulligan's &quot;incipient ventripotence&quot; indicates that he is pregnant. It is possible that, in the Shakespearean context of ''Ulysses'', Joyce intended Mulligan to represent the fat knight [[w:Falstaff|Falstaff]] to Stephen's [[w:Prince Hal|Prince Hal]].

'''plump'''{{spaces|5}}(2) Blunt (in manners); crude; rude; clownish.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary.''&lt;/ref&gt; These adjectives accurately describe Mulligan's character.


'''Buck Mulligan'''{{spaces|5}}Malachi Mulligan is a portrait of Oliver St. John Gogarty, a young writer and medical student with whom Joyce (portrayed here as Stephen Dedalus) lived for six nights (9-14 June 1904) in the [[w:Martello tower|Martello Tower]] at [[w:Sandycove|Sandycove]]. According to the two [[w:Linati schema for Ulysses|schemas]] which Joyce provided for ''Ulysses'', Buck Mulligan here represents [[w:Antinous son of Eupeithes|Antinous]], the leader of the suitors of [[w:Penelope|Penelope]] in the ''[[w:Odyssey|Odyssey]]''. As Stephen represents [[:w:Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] as well as the ''Odyssey's'' [[w:Telemachus|Telemachus]], Mulligan can also be identified with [[w:King Claudius|Claudius]].


'''stairhead'''{{spaces|5}}A [[wikt:stairhead|stairhead]] is a level space at the top of a flight of steps. In the Martello tower at Sandycove, a narrow spiral staircase of stone steps leads from the interior of the tower to the roof or [[wikt:terreplein|terreplein]]. Buck Mulligan, in mockery of the Catholic ceremony of the [[w:Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], has just ascended these steps in imitation of a Catholic priest ascending the steps to the altar.


'''bearing'''{{spaces|5}}A more solemn word than ''carrying''. One also ''[[wikt:bear#Etymology_2|bears arms]]'', appropriate here, as Mulligan and Stephen will [[wikt:cross swords|cross swords]] in this episode. The military setting in the Martello tower underscores the sense or meaning Joyce assigned to this episode in the Linati schema: ''Il figlio spodestato alla lotta'' (&quot;The dispossessed son in combat&quot;).


'''bowl'''{{spaces|5}}Mulligan's shaving bowl represents the [[w:chalice|chalice]] that holds the wine, which becomes the blood of Christ in the Mass.


'''razor'''{{spaces|5}}The first of many allusions in this episode to blades and cutting. Mulligan is a shaver, and also a future surgeon, but the deadliest weapon in this episode is neither the razor nor the scalpel. Rather than belonging to Mulligan, it is in the possession of Stephen (at least as he sees it). It is ''the lancet'' of his (Stephen's) art, the ''cold steel pen''. This allusion is a play on the phrase &quot;the pen is mightier than the sword&quot;. 


'''''Introibo ad altare Dei'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''I will go in to the altar of God.'' The Latin [[w:Tridentine Mass|Tridentine Mass]] opens with the ''Prayers at the Foot of the Altar''. After making the [[w:Sign of the Cross|Sign of the Cross]], the priest and his servers intone an [[wikt:antiphon|antiphon]] based on Psalm 43 (Vulgate 42), ''Iudica Me, Deus'' (''Judge Me, O God''), the fourth verse of which Mulligan quotes. By intoning these words ''after'' he has ascended the steps, Mulligan has perverted the order of the liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/tutorial/ordo-missae-1.html Prayers at the Foot of the Altar]&lt;/ref&gt;

Joyce preferred to indicate spoken dialogue with a dash, in the Continental manner, rather than with inverted commas. The latter were used, against the author's wishes, in ''[[w:Dubliners|Dubliners]]'' and the first two editions of ''[[w:A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man|A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Walter Gabler, ''A Note on the Text'', in James Joyce, ''Dubliners'', Vintage International (1993), page 233.&lt;/ref&gt;


'''Chrysostomos'''{{spaces|5}}(''Greek'') ''Χρυσόστομος'' is Greek for ''golden-mouthed'', a common epithet meaning ''[[wikt:eloquent|eloquent]]'', though here it refers literally to Mulligan's [[w:Gold teeth|gold-pointed teeth]].&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 14.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The epithet was applied to [[w:John Chrysostom|St John Chrysostomos]], one of the fathers of the Greek church, whose name recalls that of [[w:Oliver St. John Gogarty|Oliver ''St John'' Gogarty]], Joyce's principal model for Buck Mulligan. On 16 June, the feast of the [[wikt:confessor|confessor]] [[w:St. John Francis Regis|St John Francis Regis]], the fourth lesson of the [[w:Nocturns|Second Nocturn]] would have been taken from one of John Chrysostom's sermons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/stream/romanbreviaryref03cath#page/457/mode/1up John, Marquess of Bute (translator), ''The Roman Breviary'' (1908) 457.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ireland [[w:Pope Gregory I|Pope Gregory the Great]] was known as ''Grigoir Belóir'' (''Gregory of the Golden Mouth'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100005A/index.html ''Annals of the Four Masters'' M590.4] and [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/G100005A/index.html ''Annála Ríoghachta Éireann'' M590.4.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also, reputedly, an Irish  saint of the 6th-century known as ''Greoihir Belóir'' (''Gregory of the Golden Mouth''). He lived in a cave in the [[w:Aran Islands|Aran Islands]]. A local myth recounts that he bit off his lower lip while fretting over his sins, and a golden lip grew in its place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/stream/irishlocallegend00ohan#page/n44/mode/1up John O'Hanlon, ''Irish Local Legends'' 27-29.]&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory's Sound, between Inishmore and Inishmaan, is named after him. [[w:John Millington Synge|John Millington Synge]] mentions the Bay of Gregory of the Golden Mouth in his one-act play ''[[w:Riders to the Sea|Riders to the Sea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.one-act-plays.com/dramas/riders_to_the_sea.html ''Riders to the Sea''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his early satire ''Gas from a Burner'' (1912), Joyce refers to [[w:Augusta, Lady Gregory|Lady Gregory]] as ''Gregory of the Golden Mouth''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.books.james-joyce/msg/9293e8a84ff978c9 ''Gas from a Burner'' 42.]&lt;/ref&gt;


'''Two strong shrill whistles''' The two whistles represent the [[w:Sacring-Bell|sacring bell]], which is rung during the elevation of the consecrated Host during Mass. The origin of these helpful whistles is still a mystery. There are two obvious sources: (1) the mailboat, which is just about to leave Kingtown Harbour, about 1200 metres away (see [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Telemachus/005|005.17]]) (2) a train arriving at Sandycove Railway Station, about 900 metres away.

In the live reading of ''Ulysses'', broadcast in 1982 on ''[[w:Raidió Teilifís Éireann|Raidió Éireann]]'' to commemorate Joyce's centenary, the two whistles were represented by two blasts of a ship's whistle. But the resulting sound is hardly ''shrill'', sounding more like a tuba than a piccolo.

I prefer the train whistle, which is normally of much higher pitch than a ship's whistle. In the final episode of ''Ulysses'', Molly hears two train whistles (see [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Penelope/706|706.05]] and [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Penelope/713|713.11]]). It is possible that Joyce intended a connection between these two events, linking the novel's most [[w:Mephistopheles|Mephistophelean]] character at the beginning of the book with the [[w:Eternal feminine|Ever-Womanly]] Molly at the end. Molly's bedroom at 7 Eccles Street is only about 600 metres from [[w:Drumcondra railway station|Drumcondra Railway Station]].

005.12 '''Algy calls it . . . mother?''' {{spaces|5}} Algernon &quot;Algy&quot; Charles Swinburne, a Victorian poet, wrote these words in the poem &quot;A Triumph of Time.&quot; On line 257 and 258, he writes &quot;I will go back to the great sweet mother,/Mother and lover of men, the sea.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/swinburne/triumph.html &quot;A Triumph of Time&quot; by A. C. Swinburne] ''The Poems of Algernon Charles Swinburne'', 6 volumes, London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; The imagery of the sea here is feminine and sexual, set in direct apposition to Buck's use of &quot;snotgreen&quot; and &quot;scrotumtightening&quot; as descriptors of the sea.


005.13 '''''Epi oinopa ponton'''''{{spaces|5}}(''[[w:Homeric Greek|Homeric Greek]]'') ''Upon the wine-coloured sea''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 15.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The Homeric epithet ''ἐπὶ οἴνοπα πόντον'' occurs several times in the ''[[w:Odyssey|Odyssey]]'', the first occurrence being at 1:183.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0135%3Abook%3D1%3Acard%3D178 ''Odyssey'' 1:178-229.]&lt;/ref&gt; The precise meaning of ''οἴνοπα'' (''wine-faced, wine-dark, wine-coloured'', or something else) has been endlessly debated by scholars. Nevertheless, this phrase remains perhaps the best-known quotation from ancient Greek literature, one which scholars of the language are sure to encounter in their first months of study. By putting this quote into Mulligan's mouth, Joyce is not doing Mulligan's scholarship any favours. Ironically, the Classical Greek which Mulligan would have learned at Oxford was not [[w:Pronunciation of Ancient Greek in teaching|pronounced]] according to the reconstructed pronunciation of Ancient Greek; the Classical Association, which promoted the introduction of a more authentic pronunciation, was only founded in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classicalassociation.org/ The Classical Association.]&lt;/ref&gt; So Mulligan has almost as little experience of the Greeks ''in the original'' as Stephen.


005.15 '''''Thalatta! Thalatta!'''''{{spaces|5}}(''[[w:Attic Greek|Attic Greek]]'') ''The sea! The sea!''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 15.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 13.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[w:Thalatta! Thalatta!|θάλαττα θάλαττα]]'' is a familiar quotation from the ''[[w:Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' (''The Inland Expedition'') of [[w:Xenophon|Xenophon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0201%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D7%3Asection%3D24 Xenophon, ''Anabasis'' 4:7:24.]&lt;/ref&gt; The joyful cry of the Ten Thousand Greek mercenaries upon finally reaching the Black Sea is one of the best-known quotations from ancient Greek literature. Joyce is once again undermining Mulligan's scholarship by having him quote such a familiar phrase.


005.24 '''hyperborean''' {{spaces|5}} A word comprised of &quot;hyper-,&quot; a Greek term meaning beyond or above, and &quot;borean,&quot; a term referring to the north wind. &lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hyperborean] Dictionary.com definition of &quot;Hyperborean.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Hyperboreans were said to live in a land beyond where the north wind dwelt in Thrace. This mythical land was perfect, and the sun shone all the time, perhaps suggesting a place within the arctic circle. In Joyce, &quot;Hyperborean&quot; is used to refer to a character's Celtic origin, having come from Asia and settled in Ireland, beyond the north wind.&lt;ref&gt;[w:Hyperborea|Hyperborea]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the reference to the mirror is from another work: Oscar Wilde's preface to ''The Picture of Dorian Gray''. In it, Wilde says that &quot;The nineteenth century dislike of Realism is that of Caliban seeing his own face in the glass. The nineteenth century dislike of Romanticism is that of Caliban not seeing his own face in the glass.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26740 ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' by Oscar Wilde. London: Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent, &amp; co. (1916)]&lt;/ref&gt; As Mulligan pulls the mirror away from Daedalus' face, he says &quot;If only Wilde could see you now,&quot; as if to suggest that Daedalus has somehow opposed Wilde's aphorism.

008.30 '''Sir Peter Teazle''' {{spaces|5}} [[w:Sir_Peter_Teazle|Sir_Peter_Teazle]] was a British thoroughbred racehorse. His name is used as a then-familiar example of why Daedalus' mother had lost touch with reality.


008.32 '''hired mute from Lalouette's''' {{spaces|5}} In the [[w:Victorian_era|Victorian_era]], mourners were commonly hired for funerals to add to the atmosphere. These people were dressed in dull colors and stood near the entrance to the home or church, looking somber. Lalouette's, Gifford and Seidman note, was a Dublin mortuary whose rental services included mutes. &lt;ref&gt;[http://joyceproject.com/notes/010070mutes.htm The Joyce Project]&lt;/ref&gt; Mulligan's reference would have been obvious to Daedalus, because mutes had been in common use since Elizabethan England, and Lalouette's was famous in the region.

009.13 '''Sassenach''' {{spaces|5}} &quot;Sassenach&quot; is a Gàidhlig loanword, denoting &quot;Saxon.&quot; It bears a disparaging meaning, and is often used in jest. &lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxons Wikipedia's page on Saxon]&lt;/ref&gt;


009.20-22 '''''And no more . . . brazen cars''''' {{spaces|5}} These words are from a poem by William Butler Yeats titled ''Who Goes with Fergus.'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/who-goes-with-fergus/ ''Who Goes with Fergus'' by William Butler Yeats]&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce repeatedly quotes poems by Yeats, perhaps to reinforce his statement about the cracked mirror as &quot;a symbol of Irish art&quot; on page 007.02. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.spectacle.org/398/thoughts.html Five Ideas about Joyce]&lt;/ref&gt;

010.05 '''I am the boy . . . invisibility''' {{spaces|5}} From a popular musical of the day called ''Turko the Terrible.'' In it, King Turko sings about how he will use his newfound gift of invisibility, given him by a rose. &lt;ref&gt;[http://joyceproject.com/notes/010078invisibility.htm The Joyce Project]&lt;/ref&gt; Daedalus' mother hid that she attended bawdy shows, and this poem is used to illustrate that fact.


010.09 '''And no more . . . brood''' {{spaces|5}} From the same Yeats poem as 009.20.


010.21 '''''Liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet : iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''May the lilied throng of radiant Confessors encompass thee; may the choir of rejoicing Virgins welcome thee.'' These words are taken from the ''Ordo Commendationis Animae'' (''Rite for the Commending of a Departing Soul''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preces-latinae.org/thesaurus/Varia/CommendatioAnimae.html ''Ordo Commendationis Animae''.]&lt;/ref&gt; one of the Prayers for the Dying that form part of the [[w:Last Rites|Last Rites]] given to Catholics at the point of death. This prayer can be found in the ''[[w:Roman Ritual|Roman Ritual]]'' (''Rituale Romanum''), the official book of the [[w:Roman Rite|Roman Rite]] containing all the services not found in the ''[[w:Missale Romanum|Missal]]'' or ''[[w:Brevarium Romanum|Breviary]]''. It comprises the seventh chapter of the title ''Anointing of the Sick''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/stream/ritualeromanumpa00cath#page/156/mode/1up ''Rituale Romanum'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen would have heard these words when the Last Rites were being given to his dying mother.

''Liliata'', &quot;lilied&quot;, means &quot;as white as lilies&quot; or &quot;as bright as lilies&quot;. ''[[wikt:confessor|Confessors]]'' are saints who suffered for their faith but were not martyred for it.

011.12-17 '''''O, won't we have . . . coronation day?''''' {{spaces|5}} One form of an English song to commemorate the coronation of King Edward VII. Its words are repeated several times through the book. It is one of many ditties which Mulligan disrespectfully sings to refer to his surroundings or situation. In this case, he may be using &quot;coronation day&quot; as a rough slang for &quot;payday,&quot; because the amount could be reckoned in crowns. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cas.umt.edu/english/joyce/notes/010029coronation.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;


011.28 '''barbacans''' {{spaces|5}} or barbican: an outwork of a fortified place, as a castle; a defensive outpost of any sort. &lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/barbican Dictionary.com Barbican]&lt;/ref&gt;

A common [[w:Trinitarian formula|Trinitarian formula]] used in numerous prayers and rites of the Catholic Church and when making the [[w:Sign of the Cross|Sign of the Cross]]. In the context of the parody of the Catholic Mass, begun by Mulligan on the [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Telemachus/003|opening page]] of the novel, the priest would first intone these words while making the Sign of the Cross before the antiphon ''Intoibo ad altare Dei'', and later at the beginning of the [[w:Introit|Introit]]. By placing them here in the midst of the [[w:Eucharist|Eucharist]], Mulligan is again perverting the order of the liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Gifford |first1 = Don |last2 = Seidman |first2 = Robert J. |title = Ulysses Annotated |publisher = University of California Press |year = 1988 |page = 20}}&lt;br&gt;

013.9 '''Mabinogion''' {{spaces|5}} [[w:Mabinogion|The Mabinogion]] is a title given to eleven collected medieval Welsh folk tales. These tales were collected and translated into English in the mid 19th century by Lady Charlotte Guest. They span a large range of topics and use pre-Christian Celtic mythology, folktalke motifs, and medieval historical traditions. &lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mabinogion Wikipedia article: Mabinogion]&lt;/ref&gt;


013.9 '''Upanishads''' {{spaces|5}} [[w:Upanishads|The Upanishads]] are a collection of texts from the stories that form the basis for the Hindu religion. Their importance in India is still significant, for with the [[w:Bhagavad_Gita|Bhagavad Gita]] and [[w:Brahmasutra|Brahmasutra]] the oldest of these nearly 200 texts form the basis of many older Hindu philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upanishads Wikipedia article: Upanishads]&lt;/ref&gt;

Joyce referenced the Mabinogion and the Upanishads to give mother Grogan's tea a certain air of antiquity, and to give Mulligan a certain air of pompous self-importance. None of the men in the tower had any reason to suspect that Grogan's tea was in any ancient texts.

013.20 '''finical''' {{spaces|5}} finicky,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/finical Dictionary.com &quot;finical&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; in other words, excessively particular or fastidious; difficult to please; fussy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/finicky Dictionary.com &quot;finicky&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

014.18 '''Are you a medical student, sir?''' {{spaces|5}} The milkwoman asks Mulligan if he is a medical student. He answers in the affirmative, claiming medical knowledge. Joyce has undermined this knowledge as recently as 006.24, when Mulligan incorrectly identifies the definition of GPI.

This is the title of a translation of a French moral treatise ''Le Somme de Vices et de Virtues'' (''The Book of Vices and Vertues''), written in 1279 by the Dominican monk Frère Lorens (Laurentius Gallus). Lorens was confessor to [[w:Philip III of France|Philip III of France]] and it was for the king that he wrote the treatise. It is a layman's manual of sins and virtues, similar in content and style to ''[[w:The Parson's Tale|The Parson's Tale]]'' in [[w:Geoffrey Chaucer|Geoffrey Chaucer's]] ''[[w:The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]''. The English translation was made in 1340 by [[w:Dan Michel of Northgate|Dan Michel of Northgate]], and is highly valued today by scholars of Middle English, being one of the few surviving works in the Kentish dialect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/stream/danmichelsayenb00michgoog#page/n4/mode/2up Dan Michel of Northgate, ''Ayenbite of Inwyt''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

018.05 '''proves by algebra''' {{spaces|5}} This is explained more fully on [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce%27s_Ulysses/Nestor/028|028.18]], within context.


018.16 '''Elsinore''' {{spaces|5}} The castle in Shakespeare's ''Hamlet''. The italicized line is a quote from act 1 scene 4, line 77, in which Horatio describes the way the cliff hangs over its base.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/hamlet-text/act-i-scene-iv enotes.com Text of Shakespeare's ''Hamlet'']&lt;/ref&gt;


018.33 '''The Ballad of Joking Jesus''' {{spaces|5}} The song inscribed in the text is a modified form of the poem [[w:The_Song_of_the_Cheerful_(but_slightly_Sarcastic)_Jesus|The Song of the Cheerful (but slightly Sarcastic) Jesus]] by [[w:Oliver_St._John_Gogarty|Oliver St. John Gogarty]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Song_of_the_Cheerful_(but_slightly_Sarcastic)_Jesus Wikipedia entry regarding The Song of the Cheerful (but slightly Sarcastic) Jesus]&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce uses it as a continued satirical comment on the Catholic church by having Mulligan sing, who has taken on the voice of the maudlin priest in this mass. Dedalus refers to it as a prayer on [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce%27s_Ulysses/Telemachus/019|019.23]], saying that he has heard the joke three times daily, after meals.

      <comment>Added Carlyle and Spencer to the Übermensch annotation</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Ulysses, 1922.djvu|thumb|600px|center|page=25]]
&lt;br&gt;
==Annotations==
022.26 '''''Uebermensch'' ... the supermen'''{{spaces|5}}(''German'') literally ''Superman''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 27.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[w:Übermensch|Übermensch]]'' is a philosophical concept introduced by Thomas Carlyle in 1840 in his book ''On Heroes, Hero-Worship and the Heroic in History''.&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Great_Man_theory|Wikipedia entry on Great Man Theory]]&lt;/ref&gt; The book proposed that &quot;The history of the world is but the biography of great men,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hirsch |first=E.D. |title=The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy (Third Edition) |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |city=Boston |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that each era of human civilization was defined by the abilities and religion of its Übermensch. Used this way, Joyce would be advocating that his heros are the defining force behind their society. &lt;/br&gt;

However, Herbert Spencer believed the causal relationship worked the opposite way. Instead, he argued that society defined its own Übermensch. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Spencer |first=Herbert |title=The Study of Sociology |publisher=Appleton |year=1896 |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that Joyce believes that his unassuming heroes are Übermenschen in that they are the obvious result of the society in which they live.&lt;/br&gt;

However, Joyce refers quite clearly to another work on 022.36. Mulligan says the title of a different work: ''Thus Spake Zarathustra.'' This references the Übermensch concept as discussed by [[w:Friedrich Nietzsche|Friedrich Nietzsche]] in 1883 in his book ''[[w:Thus Spake Zarathustra|Also Sprach Zarathustra]]'' (''Thus Spake Zarathustra''). Nietzsche used the term to describe a human being who has successfully transcended or surpassed human nature, one who has freed himself from Christian morality and spiritualism, one who has evolved to a higher state. See also [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Proteus/050|050.14]].

'''''Liliata rutilantium ... virginum'''''{{spaces|5}}See [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Telemachus/010|010.21-22]]. Stephen's emended version, laid out as a [[w:tercet|tercet]], anticipates the tercet of ''Heighos'' at the end of ''[[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Calypso/067|Calypso]]''. Presumably it is 8:45&amp;nbsp;am as Stephen sets off for Dalkey. For Bloom, the bells of St George's Church are tolling for Paddy Dignam; for Stephen, the bells (real or imaginary) are ringing for his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Gunn |first1 = Ian |last2 = Hart |first2 = Clive |title = James Joyce's Dublin |publisher = Thames &amp; Hudson |year = 2004 |page = 27 |isbn = 0-500-51159-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is doubtful whether Stephen can actually hear any chimes. The closest church to him in 1904 was probably St Patrick's Church in Bullock Harbour, about 600 metres away, but it had no clock tower. St Joseph's Church on Summerhill Road, about 750 metres away, also lacked a clock tower. The closest clock tower was probably that on the Town Hall in Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire), about 1.5 kilometres away.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Collegiate Shag has a few basic variations.  The most popular is the 6-count Double Shag which uses a 'slow, slow, quick, quick' rhythm. 

BASIC PATTERN: from the lead's point-of-view.  (Follows, just mirror the Lead) 
:Beat 1: STEP onto left foot.
:Beat 2: HOP on left.
:Beat 3: STEP onto right foot
:Beat 4: HOP on right.
:Beat 5: STEP onto left foot.
:Beat 6: STEP onto right foot. 

Slow1&amp;2, Slow3&amp;4, Quick5, Quick6. The movements for 5&amp;6 can be a shuffle-step, a run-in-place, or step-in-place.  A familiar feeling is a jumping rope feeling.  Be sure to do a full transfer of weight with the planted foot has all the weight.

POSITION: There is Solo, Open, Closed.
*Solo is when you break apart have have no physical contact with partner.  You rely on visual cues and maintain the beats.
*Open is when you have a one or two handed hold, but are apart from each other.
*Closed is when Lead's left hand holds the Follow's right hand. Lead's right hand on the Follow's left shoulderblade. Body position is offset with Lead's right foot in-between the flows feet. Traditionally the hand-hold is held straight up in the air, but you can also hold the hands at the shoulder level.

KICK PATTERNS: from the lead's point-of-view.  (Follows, just mirror the Lead) 
One can kick down, to the side, in front, to the back, or tap the ground.
:Beat 1: STEP onto left foot.
:Beat 2: HOP on left while kicking the right foot.
:Beat 3: STEP onto right foot
:Beat 4: HOP on right while kicking the left foot.
:Beat 5: STEP onto left foot.
:Beat 6: STEP onto right foot. 

TURNS: The Follows can be turned with an outside, inside, a free, texas tommy, or pass-by turns patterns.  Traditionally, the Follow turns on the Quick-Quick (2counts), but they can also spin during the Slow-Slow (4counts).

028.18 '''proves by algebra''' {{spaces|5}} This is previously mentioned on [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce%27s_Ulysses/Telemachus/018|018.05]], when Mulligan uses it as an impressive facet of Dedalus' abilities.


028.32 '''''Amor matris'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''The love of a mother.'' ''A mother's love''.

'''subjective and objective genitive'''{{spaces|5}}In grammar, the [[w:Genitive_case|genitive]] or possessive case has several different forms. The Latin phrase ''Amor matris'' is ambiguous to Stephen because it means two different things depending on whether ''matris'' is subjective genitive or objective genitive:

:'''subjective genitive:''' ''A mother's love [for her child]''
:'''objective genitive:''' ''[A child's] love for his mother''

Stephen is thinking of himself and his own mother as much as he is thinking of Sargent and Sargent's mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Gifford |first1 = Don |last2 = Seidman |first2 = Robert J. |title = Ulysses Annotated |publisher = University of California Press |year = 1988 |page = 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''lord Hastings' Repulse'''{{spaces|5}}[[w:Henry Weysford Charles Plantagenet, 4th Marquess of Hastings|Henry Weysford Charles Plantagenet]] (1842-1868), was a British peer.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 37.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Irish peerage he held the titles Earl of Moira and Baron Rawdon of Moira, both of which became extinct upon his death. His racehorse Repulse won the [[w:1000 Guineas Stakes|1000 Guineas Stakes]] at Newmarket in 1866 over a distance of 1 mile (1609 metres).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pedigreequery.com/repulse Repulse Horse Pedigree.]&lt;/ref&gt; The winning jockey was Tom Cannon, Sr, a greatgrandfather of [[w:Lester Piggott|Lester Piggott]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horseracinghistory.co.uk/hrho/action/viewDocument?id=1315 Tom Cannon, Sr.]&lt;/ref&gt; The horse was trained by John Day, Jr. The 1000 Guineas is run by three-year old thoroughbred fillies.


'''the duke of Westminster's Shotover'''{{spaces|5}}[[w:Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster|Hugh Grosvenor]] (1825-1899) was a successful racehorse onwer and [[w:Master of the Horse|Master of the Horse]] from 1880-1885. His horse [[w:Shotover (horse)|Shotover]] won the [[w:Epsom Derby|Epsom Derby]] in 1882 over a distance of 1½ miles (2414 metres).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pedigreequery.com/shotover Shotover Horse Pedigree.]&lt;/ref&gt; The winning jockey was Tom Cannon, who had ridden Repulse to victory in the 1000 Guineas sixteen years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horseracinghistory.co.uk/hrho/action/viewDocument?id=1315 Tom Cannon, Sr.]&lt;/ref&gt; The horse was trained by [[w:John Porter (horseman|John Porter]]. Shotover also won the [[w:2000 Guineas Stakes|2000 Guineas Stakes]] in 1882 with the same jockey. The Epsom Derby and the 2000 Guineas are run by three-year old thoroughbreds.


'''the duke of Beaufort's Ceylon, ''prix de Paris'', 1866'''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') The [[w:Grand Prix de Paris|Grand Prix de Paris]] is a French flat horse race for three-year old thoroughbreds.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 37.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Inaugurated in 1863, it is run every July at [[w:Longchamp Racecourse|Longchamp Racecourse]] in Paris. In 1866 it was indeed won by [[w:Henry Somerset, 8th Duke of Beaufort|Henry Somerset, 8th Duke of Beaufort's]] Ceylon over a distance of 3000 metres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pedigreequery.com/ceylon Ceylon Horse Pedigree.]&lt;/ref&gt; The winning jockey was once again Tom Cannon,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horseracinghistory.co.uk/hrho/action/viewDocument?id=1315 Tom Cannon.]&lt;/ref&gt; and the trainer John Day. Beaufort (1824-1899) was the [[w:Master of the Horse|Master of the Horse]] from 1858-1859 and from 1866-1868.


'''Elfin riders sat them'''{{spaces|5}}Presumably Repulse, Shotover and Ceylon are carrying the same rider: the jockey Tom Cannon, Sr, who rode them to victory in their Classic triumphs. Is Mr Deasy an admirer of Cannon?

Jockeys are usually light and of diminutive build — [[wikt:elfin|elfin]].

The transitive use of the verb ''to sit'', meaning ''to sit upon'' or ''to ride'' is quite rare; it is most commonly used, as here, with reference to the riding of a horse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/stream/dictionaryenglis02john#page/646/mode/1up Samuel Johnson, ''A Dictionary of the English Language'', Volume 2, ''s. v.'' '''Sit'''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

But the &quot;Translucent&quot; [διαφανὲς], as we call it, is not something peculiar to air, or water, or any other of the bodies usually called translucent, but is a common &quot;nature&quot; and power, capable of no separate existence of its own, but residing in these, and subsisting likewise in all other bodies in a greater or less degree. As the bodies in which it subsists must have some extreme bounding surface, so too must this. Here, then, we may say that Light is a &quot;nature&quot; inhering in the Translucent when the latter is without determinate boundary. But it is manifest that, when the Translucent is in determinate bodies, its bounding extreme must be something real; and that colour is just this &quot;something&quot; we are plainly taught by facts, colour being actually either at the external limit, or being itself that limit [πέρας], in bodies. Hence it was that the Pythagoreans named the superficies of a body its &quot;hue&quot;, for &quot;hue&quot;, indeed, lies at the limit of the body; but the limit of the body; is not a real thing; rather we must suppose that the same natural substance which, externally, is the vehicle of colour exists [as such a possible vehicle] also in the interior of the body.''
&lt;/poem&gt;

Stephen's translation of διαφανὲς (''transparent'', ''translucent'') as ''diaphane'' suggests that he is using [[w:Thomas Aquinas|Thomas Aquinas's]] Latin commentary on ''Sense and Sensibilia'' to try and make sense of Aristotle's obscure theory:&lt;ref&gt;[http://dhspriory.org/thomas/SensuSensato.htm#5 Thomas Aquinas, ''Commentary on Sense and Sensibilia'' §5.] and [http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/css01.html#81216 ''Sentencia Libri De Sensu et Sensato'', Lectio 6.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Concludit ergo, quod color est extremitas perspicui in corpore determinato: quod quidem additur, eo quod huiusmodi corpora sunt, quae secundum se colorantur.''
&lt;/poem&gt;
| &lt;poem&gt;''Such bodies are properly called perspicuous or transparent, or also diaphanous, for in Greek means the same as visible. ... Accordingly he concludes that color is the limit of the transparent. He adds in a determinate body, because such bodies are those that are themselves colored.''
&lt;/poem&gt;

Aquinas makes similar remarks in his commentary on Aristotle's treatise ''On the Soul''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dhspriory.org/thomas/DeAnima.htm#215L Thomas Aquinas, ''Commentary on Aristotle's On the Soul'', Book 2, Lectio 15, §428.] and [http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/can2.html#80508 ''Sentencia Libri De Anima'', Librum 2, Lectio 15.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''adiaphane'' seems to be Stephen's own. Neither the Greek αδιαφανὲς nor the Latin ''adiaphana'' is to be found in his sources. The obvious meaning of ''adiaphane'' is ''the opaque'' or ''opacity'', which is what ''[[wikt:adiaphane|adiaphane]]'' means in French. (Stephen, and Joyce, read Aristotle in Paris. See [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Nestor/026|026.04 ff.]]) Four lines below, however, Stephen refers to the darkness as ''it''. In Aristotle's text, ''darkness'' (σκότος) is defined as the ''privation of light''. See also Stephen's description of darkness on the next page as ''[[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Proteus/038|the black adiaphane]]''.

It is typical of Stephen to be fascinated by Aristotle's outdated and obscure theory of light and colour (and Thomas Aquinas's comments thereon), while having little or no interest in what modern science has to say about these phenomena.


'''''maestro di color che sanno'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''master of those who know''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 45.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 42.&lt;/ref&gt; This is how [[w:Dante Alighieri|Dante]] describes [[w:Aristotle|Aristotle]] in the ''[[w:Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' 4:131-132.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/stream/inferno00aliggoog#page/n62/mode/2up Dante Alighieri, ''Inferno'' 4:131.]&lt;/ref&gt; In Dante's Italian ''color'' can mean both ''them'' and ''colour'', which is what Stephen is currently contemplating. Language is [[wikt:protean|protean]].


'''''nacheinander ... nebeneinander'''''{{spaces|5}}(''German'') ''in succession ... side by side''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 45.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen is quoting from the long essay of 1766 ''Laokoon oder über die Grenzen der Mahlerey und Poesie'' (''Laocoön, or On the Limits of Painting and Poetry'') by the German art critic [[w:Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/6889/pg6889.txt Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, ''Laokoon''.] and [http://www.archive.org/stream/laocon00lessgoog#page/n272/mode/2up ''Laocoön'' §20.]&lt;/ref&gt; Lessing was inspired to write this essay by the monumental sculpture in the Vatican known as [[w:Laocoön and His Sons|Laocoön and His Sons]] or ''The Laocoön'', which depicts the scene described by [[w:Virgil|Virgil]] in Book 2 of the ''[[w:Aeneid|Aeneid]]'', in which the Trojan priest and his sons are crushed to death by two sea-serpents, punishment, or so the Trojans think, for advising them not to accept the [[w:Trojan Horse|Wooden Horse]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0055%3Abook%3D2%3Acard%3D195 Virgil, ''Aeneid'' 2:199-233.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparing the sculpture with Virgil's verse, Lessing came to the conclusion that the visual arts (e.g. painting and sculpture) and the literary arts (e.g. poetry) should not try to emulate each other. Each has its own unique sphere: painting is spatial, insofar as the whole work of art is experienced in a single glance; poetry, on the other hand, is temporal, being recited or read from beginning to end over an extended period of time. The painter, therefore, should depict only such images as can be captured in a single moment, while the poet should depict acts and events, avoiding static descriptions:

| &lt;poem&gt;''If it is true that painting, in its imitations, makes use of entirely different means and signs from those which poetry employs; the former employing figures and colours in space, whereas the latter articulates sounds in time;''

Sie erfodert also, daß diese Teile nebeneinander liegen müssen; und da Dinge, deren Teile '''nebeneinander''' liegen, der eigentliche Gegenstand der Malerei sind; so kann sie, und nur sie allein, körperliche Schönheit nachahmen.''

''Der Dichter, der die Elemente der Schönheit nur '''nacheinander''' zeigen könnte, enthält sich daher der Schilderung körperlicher Schönheit, als Schönheit, gänzlich. Er fühlt es, daß diese Elemente, '''nacheinander''' geordnet, unmöglich die Wirkung haben können, die sie, '''nebeneinander''' geordnet, haben ....''
&lt;/poem&gt;
| &lt;poem&gt;''Corporeal beauty is the result of the harmonious action of various parts which can be taken in at a glance. It requires therefore that these parts should lie '''next to one another'''; and therefore things whose parts lie next to one another are the proper object of painting: this art and this alone can imitate corporeal beauty.''

''The poet who can only describe the elements of beauty, '''one after the other''', abstains altogether from painting corporeal beauty as beauty. He feels that these elements arranged '''in succession''' cannot possibly produce the effect which they have when arranged '''next to one another''' ....''

'''''Los'''''{{spaces|5}}[[w:Los (Blake)|Los]] is a character who appears in the [[w:William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic works]] of the English poet and mystic [[w:William Blake|William Blake]].&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 45-46.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 43.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[w:The Book of Los|The Book of Los]]'', Los appears as a smith, with furnaces, an anvil and a hammer of adamant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/work.xq?workid=b-los&amp;java=yes William Blake, ''The Book of Los'', Plate 5, lines 20-22.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a simplification, however, to regard him as the creator of the material world. It would be more accurate to assign that role jointly to Los and [[w:Urizen|Urizen]]. In March 1912, Joyce delivered a lecture in Italian at the Università Populare in Trieste on the subject of William Blake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Occasional, Critical and Political Writing |last=Joyce |first=James |editor=Kevin Barry |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-283353-7 |pages=175-182}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of this lecture he quoted from another of the poet's prophetic works, ''[[w:Milton a Poem|Milton]]'':

'''''Demiurgos'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Greek'') ''[[wikt:Demiurge|Demiurge]]'' is the modern English form of the ancient Greek [[wikt:δημιουργός|δημιουργός]] (''demiourgos''), the word [[w:Plato|Plato]] gave to the hypothetical creator of the material world.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 45-46.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 43.&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Greek the word meant ''craftsman'', ''skilled worker'', ''maker'', ''creator'', ''artist'', ''master''. Plato first used the term ''[[w:Demiurge|δημιουργός]]'' in his dialogue ''[[w:Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', not as the personal name of a specific deity, but simply as a common noun meaning ''craftsman'', ''maker'' or ''fashioner''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/physis/plato-timaeus/genesis.asp Plato, ''Timaeus'' 28a.]&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greeks did not subscribe to the notion of ''Creation from nothing'' ([[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Proteus/038|038.11]]); for Plato, the creator was a craftsman who fashioned the material world out of the already extant [[w:Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]], like the sculptor who turned a shapeless lump of marble into the ''[[w:Laocoön and His Sons|Laocoön]]''.

Later schools of philosophy that were influenced by Plato (e.g. [[w:Middle Platonism|Middle Platonism]], [[w:Neopythagoreanism|Neo-Pythagoreanism]], [[w:Neoplatonism|Neo-Platonism]]) regarded the Demiurge as an important but subordinate deity. [[w:Gnosticism|Gnostics]] used the concept of a Demiurge to solve the perennial [[w:Problem of evil|problem of evil]].The Gnostic [[w:Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentine]], mentioned by Stephen in ''[[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Telemachus/021|Telemachus]]'', is reputed to have included the Demiurge in his theology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnosis.org/library/flora.htm Ptolemy, ''Letter to Flora''.] [[w:Ptolemy (gnostic)|Ptolemy the Gnostic]] was a disciple of Valentine.&lt;/ref&gt; In Joyce's time, the [[w:Theosophical Society|Theosophical Society]] used the term to describe ''the Supernal Power which built the universe''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/stream/isisunveiledama03blavgoog#page/n44/mode/1up/ Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, ''Isis Unveiled'' 1:xxviii.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''lex eterna'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''eternal law''. [[w:Thomas_Aquinas|St Thomas Aquinas]] discusses the various kinds of law in his ''[[w:Summa Theologica|Summa Theologica]]''. In the First Part of Part 2, Question 91, Article 1, he writes:

{{quote|''... a law is nothing else but a dictate of practical reason emanating from the ruler who governs a perfect community. Now it is evident, granted that the world is ruled by Divine Providence ... that the whole community of the universe is governed by Divine Reason. Wherefore the very Idea of the government of things in God the Ruler of the universe, has the nature of a law. And since the Divine Reason's conception of things is not subject to time but is eternal, according to Proverbs 8:23, therefore it is that this kind of law must be called eternal ... the end of the Divine government is God Himself, and His law is not distinct from Himself. Wherefore the eternal law is not ordained to another end. ''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2091.htm ''Summa Theologica.'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stephen argues that God himself is bound by the ''lex eterna'', as this is nothing but a manifestation of God's reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Gifford |first1 = Don |last2 = Seidman |first2 = Robert J. |title = Ulysses Annotated |publisher = University of California Press |year = 1988 |page = 47}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Thornton|first1 = Weldon|title = Allusions in Ulysses |publisher = University of North Carolina Press |year = 1968 |page = 45}}&lt;/ref&gt; St Thomas discusses the nature of Eternal Law in Question 96.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2093.htm ''Summa Theologica.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

It is worn about the neck and shoulders in such a manner that the ends cross on the left shoulder, one end falling to the knees in front, the other behind.

'''''Descende, calve, ut ne nimium decalveris.'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''Come down, O bald head, lest you be made excessively bald.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Gifford |first1 = Don |last2 = Seidman |first2 = Robert J. |title = Ulysses Annotated |publisher = University of California Press |year = 1988 |page = 50}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Thornton|first1 = Weldon|title = Allusions in Ulysses |publisher = University of North Carolina Press |year = 1968 |page = 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen has altered the opening words of the first prophecy in the ''[[w:Vaticinia de Summis Pontificibus|Vaticinia Pontificum]]'' (''Prophecies of the Popes'', Venice, 1589), which was spuriously attributed to [[w:Joachim of Fiore|Joachim Abbas]]: ''Ascende, calve, ut ne amplius decalveris, qui non vereris decalvere sponsam: ut comam ursae nutrias'' (''Go up, O bald one, lest you be made more bald, you who are not afraid to make your wife bald in order to nourish the she-bear's hair'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://schulen.eduhi.at/stift_kremsmuenster/vat/vat01.htm ''Vaticinia Pontificum'']&lt;br&gt;[http://www.archive.org/stream/siueprophetiaeab00joac#page/n37/mode/2up Internet Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

The prophecy recalls II Kings 2:23-24: ''And he ([[w:Elisha|Elisha]]) went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head. And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings+2&amp;version=KJV King James Version]&lt;/ref&gt; In the Latin Vulgate, the childrens' taunt is rendered: ''ascende calve ascende calve''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings+2&amp;version=VULGATE Bibla Sacra Vulgata]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen's Latin phrase is based on the very first sentence of the ''Vaticinia Pontificum''. When he (or Joyce) browsed a copy of this work in [[w:Marsh's Library|Marsh's Library]], it is possible that he read no further than this. He probably first encountered Joachim in his reading of [[w:Dante Alighieri|Dante's]] ''[[w:Divine Comedy|Divine Comedy]]''. In ''Paradiso'' 140-141 Joachim is described as ''il calavrese abate Giovacchino, di spirito profetico dotato'' (''the Calabrian abbot Joachim, endowed with a prophetic spirit'').

When an earlier version of this episode was published in ''[[w:The Little Review|The Little Review]]'' in May 1918, the reading was ''amplius''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/stream/littlereview05mcke#page/n41/mode/1up ''The Little Review'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''O si, certo !'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''O yes, certainly!''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 51.&lt;/ref&gt; In Italian the word for ''yes'' is usually spelt ''sì'' (or, rarely, ''sí''). ''Sì certo'', without the comma, means ''certainly''.

'''mahamanvantara'''{{spaces|5}}(''Sanskrit'') This is an esoteric term used in Hinduism to denote a very long [[w:Hindu units of measurements|period of time]].&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 51.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 49.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[w:Manvantara|manvantara]] is a period of time equal to the lifespan of a [[w:Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]]: 306,720,000 years. A mahamanvantara or mahakalpa is a period of time equal to the lifespan of [[w:Brahma (god)|Brahma]]: 311,040,000,000,000 years.

:1 mahayuga = 4,320,000 years
:71 mahayugas = 1 manvantara = 306,720,000 years
:2000 mahayugas = 1 day and night of Brahma = 8,640,000,000 years
:720,000 mahayugas = 1 year of Brahma = 3,110,400,000,000 years
:100 years of Brahma = 1 mahamanvantara = 311,040,000,000,000 years.

In the context of ''Ulysses'', the meaning assigned to the term ''mahamanvantara'' in the theosophy of [[w:Helena Blavatsky|Helena Blavatsky]] is probably of greater relevance. In a glossary of theosophical terms, which Blavatsky appended to the 1890 edition of ''The Key to Theosophy'', the entries for ''Mahamanvantara'' and ''Manvantara'' are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/stream/keytotheosophybe00blav#page/299/mode/1up Helena Blavatsky, ''The Key to Theosophy'' 299, 301.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|'''Mahâmanvantara''' (''Sans.'') The great interludes between the ''Manus'', the period of universal activity. ''Manvantara'' here implies simply a period of activity, as opposed to ''praylaya'' or rest, without reference to the length of the cycle.}}

{{quote|'''Manvantara''' (''Sans.'') A period of manifestation, as opposed to ''pralaya'', dissolution or rest; the term is applied to various cycles, especially to a Day of Brahmâ, 4,320,000,000 solar years, and to the reign of one Manu, 306,720,000. Lit., ''Manu-antara'', between Manus. (See ''Secret Doctrine'', ii., 68 ''et seq''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/stream/secretdoctrines01blavgoog#page/n90/mode/1up Helena Blavatsky, ''The Secret Doctrine'', Volume 2, pp. 68 ff.]&lt;/ref&gt;)}} 


'''''— Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position?'''''&lt;br&gt;
'''''— C'est le pigeon, Joseph.'''''&lt;br&gt;
(''French'') This is a near quotation from ''La Vie de Jésus'' (''The Life of Jesus''), an anti-Catholic novel by [[w:Léo Taxil|Léo Taxil]]:&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 52.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 50-51.&lt;br&gt;{{cite book |title=La Vie de Jésus |last=Taxil |first=Léo |year=1884 |publisher=P. Fort |location=Paris |page=15 |url=http://books.google.ie/books/about/La_Vie_de_J%C3%A9sus.html?id=auAuQwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::''— Who put you in this wretched condition?''
::''— It was the pigeon, Joseph.''

In the original, Joseph actually asks: ''Qui donc, si ce n'est un homme, vous a mis dans cette fichue position?'' (''Who then, if it wasn't a man, put you in this wretched position?'').

French grammar requires the feminine participle ''mise'' (''put''), as [[w:Saint Joseph|Joseph]] is asking [[w:Mary (mother of Jesus|Mary]]. But the error, which Stephen (Joyce?) replicates here, was already present in the edition of the book that would have been available to Joyce in Zürich.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robotwisdom.com/jaj/ulysses/nodding.html Jorn Barger, ''Joyce nodding?'']&lt;/ref&gt;


'''''lait chaud'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''hot milk'', ''warm milk''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 52.&lt;/ref&gt;


'''''lapin'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''rabbit''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 52.&lt;/ref&gt;


'''''gros lots'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''top prizes'', ''jackpots''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen, it seems, misunderstands this French term. He is referring to the public lotteries, which had been permitted in France since 1844.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri17chisrich#page/21/mode/1up ''Encyclopædi Britannica'' (Eleventh Edition), '''Lotteries'''.]&lt;/ref&gt; But ''[[wikt:lot|lot]]'' means ''prize (in a lottery)'', so the actual meaning of ''gros lots'' is ''first prizes'' or ''jackpots''.


'''''La Vie de Jésus'' by M. Léo Taxil'''{{spaces|5}}[[w:Léo Taxil|Léo Taxil]] was the pseudonym of the anti-Catholic and anti-clerical French writer Marie Joseph Gabriel Antoine Jogand-Pagès (1854-1907).&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 53.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Vie de Jésus'' (''The Life of Jesus'', also known in English as ''The Amusing Gospel'') is a humorous work, in which Taxil satirically holds up to ridicule inconsistencies, errors, and false beliefs to be found in the gospels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=La Vie de Jésus |last=Taxil |first=Léo |year=1884 |publisher=P. Fort |location=Paris |page=15 |url=http://books.google.ie/books/about/La_Vie_de_J%C3%A9sus.html?id=auAuQwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;


'''''— C'est tordant, vous savez. Moi je suis socialiste. Je ne crois pas en l'existence de Dieu. Faut pas le dire a mon père.'''''&lt;br&gt;
'''''— Il croit?'''''&lt;br&gt;
'''''— Mon père, oui.'''''&lt;br&gt;
(''French'') This is a fragment of a conversation Stephen had in Paris with Patrice Egan about Taxil's ''La Vie de Jésus'':&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

::''— It's hilarious, you know. Me, I'm a socialist. I do not believe in the existence of God. You mustn't tell my father.''&lt;br&gt;
::''— He is a believer?''&lt;br&gt;
::''— My father, yes.''&lt;br&gt;


'''''Schluss'''''{{spaces|5}}(''German'') ''Period!'' ''Enough said!''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 53.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[wikt:Schluss|Schluss]]'' is German for ''end'', ''conclusion'', but here Stephen is using it colloquially as a mild exclamation, meaning ''Enough!''


'''Paysayennn. P. C. N., you know : ''physiques, chimiques et naturelles'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''physical, chemical and natural''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 53.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Paysayenn'' is a phonetic spelling of how a Frenchman would pronounce the letters ''[[w:French alphabet|P. C. N.]]'' The letters are an abbreviation for the French phrase ''[[w:fr:PCN|Physique-Chimie-Sciences naturelles]]'' (''Physics, Chemistry, Natural Science''). In December 1902, Joyce was granted a provisional card of admission to the course for the certificate in physics, chemistry and biology at the École de Médecine in Paris. This certificate was required before he would be permitted to study medicine. As it happened, his medical ambitions only lasted a few more days.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1982) 112-113.&lt;/ref&gt; Note that Stephen's translation of ''P. C. N.'' is not quite correct.


'''''mou en civet'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''lung stew''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 53.&lt;/ref&gt; A stew made from the lungs or [[wikt:lights|lights]] of butchered animals would have been one of the cheapest dishes available in a Paris restaurant.


'''''boul'Mich''''''{{spaces|5}}(''French slang'') ''Boulevard Saint-Michel''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 53.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904 the [[w:Boulevard Saint-Michel|Boulevard Saint-Michel]], a street on the [[w:Rive Gauche (Paris)|Left Bank]] of the Seine in Paris, was the café centre of the city's student and bohemian life.

'''''Lui, c'est moi'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''I am he''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 53.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 51-52.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen's statement is a parody of the oft-quoted remark attributed to [[w:Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV of France]]: ''L'état, c'est moi'' (''I am the state'').


'''''Encore deux minutes''. Look clock. Must get. ''Fermé'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''Still two minutes to go ... Closed''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen is recalling an incident when he tried to cash a money order from his mother at a French post-office. When the door was closed in his face, he pleaded with the usher in broken French and English: ''There are still two minutes to go [before closing time]. Look [at the] clock. [I] must get [this money order cashed].'' To which the usher replied: ''[We're] closed''.


'''''Euge! Euge!'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''Well done! Well done!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Gifford |first1 = Don |last2 = Seidman |first2 = Robert J. |title = Ulysses Annotated |publisher = University of California Press |year = 1988 |page = 54}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite book |last = Thornton |first = Weldon |title = Allusions in Ulysses |publisher = The University of North Carolina Press |year = 1968 |page = 52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Latin Vulgate translation of the Bible, this interjection is always used ironically by a mocker, as is clearly intended here. English versions usually translate the original Hebrew as ''Aha'' or ''Ah'':

:'''Ezekiel 25:3'''{{spaces|3}}''et dices filiis Ammon audite verbum Domini Dei haec dicit Dominus Deus pro eo quod dixisti '''euge euge''' super sanctuarium meum quia pollutum est et super terram Israhel quoniam desolata est et super domum Iuda quoniam ducti sunt in captivitatem''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2025&amp;version=VULGATE Bible Gateway]&lt;/ref&gt; 

:'''Ezekiel 25:3'''{{spaces|3}}''And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou saidst, '''Aha''', against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity;''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2025&amp;version=KJV Bible Gateway]&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Hebrew word is ''heach''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://concordances.org/hebrew/1889.htm Strong's Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;


'''''Comment'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''What?''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 54.&lt;/ref&gt; At [[w:Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]] in England, on his way to Paris, Stephen pretended he was French and could not speak English in order to avoid having to pay a porter threepence to carry his valise.


'''''Le Tutu'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') A ''[[wikt:tutu|tutu]]'' is a short ballet skirt.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 54.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 52-53.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Le Tutu'' was a humorous weekly magazine that first appeared in Paris on 25 March 1901.


'''''Pantalon Blanc et Culotte Rouge'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''White Knickers and Red Panties''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 54.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 53.&lt;/ref&gt; No such periodical is known, though the second half of the name recalls a geniune French magazine, ''La Vie en Culotte Rouge'' (''Life in Red Breeches'', or ''Among the Camp Followers'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb32888964b/date ''La Vie en Culotte Rouge''.] ''Culotte rouge'' is also French slang for a ''camp follower''.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that Joyce concocted the title so as to strengthen the link between Stephen and Bloom, for whom women's undergarments are a fetish. See [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Lotus_Eaters/070|070.33 - 071.37]], and of course ''[[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Nausicaa/331|Nausicaa]]''.


'''Paris rawly waking, crude sunlight on her lemon streets. Moist pith of farls of bread, the froggreen wormwood, her matin incense, court the air. Belluomo rises from the bed of his wife's lover's wife, the kerchiefed housewife is astir, a saucer of acetic acid in her hand.'''{{spaces|5}}For this description of early morning in Paris, Joyce drew heavily upon his unpublished prose poem ''[[w:Giacomo Joyce|Giacomo Joyce]]'', where it is [[w:Trieste|Trieste]] that is being described:

{{quote|''Trieste is waking rawly: raw sunlight over its huddled browntiled roofs, testudoform; a multitude of prostrate bugs awwait a national deliverance. Belluomo rises from the bed of his wife's lover's wife: the busy housewife is astir, sloe-eyed, a saucer of acetic acid in her hand.....''}}


'''Belluomo'''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''Handsome man''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian makes sense in the context of Trieste (see above).


'''''chaussons'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''turnovers''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 54.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''chausson'' is a [[wikt:turnover|turnover]] made, usually, with puff pastry and a fruit filling. ''Chaussons aux pommes'' are [[wikt:apple turnover|apple turnovers]].


'''''pus'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''pus''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 54.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[wikt:pus|Pus]]'' is a viscous yellowish liquid associated with bacterial infections (e.g. pimples). Stephen is referring to the yellow custard in a ''flan bréton''.


'''''flan bréton'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''custard tart''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 54.&lt;/ref&gt; In French ''[[wikt:flan|flan]]'' denotes a baked custard tart. The variety of custard tart associated with [[w:Brittany|Brittany]] is called a ''[[w:Far Breton|Far Breton]]''. But Stephen's reference to the yellow pus of the custard suggests that he has some sort of custard pastry in mind in which the custard is not set, such as a ''[[w:Mille-feuille|mille-feuille]]''.

''Breton'', without the acute accent on the ''e'', is the correct spelling. In the ''[[w:The Little Review|The Little Review]]'', which published an early draft of this episode in 1918, the word was spelt ''brêton''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.lib.brown.edu/repository2/repoman.php?verb=render&amp;id=1298917764984376&amp;view=pageturner&amp;pageno=39 ''The Little Review'' 5:1:37.]&lt;/ref&gt;


'''conquistadores'''{{spaces|5}}(''French Slang'') ''lady-killers''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 54.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[w:Conquistador|Conquistadores]]'' is a Spanish word for the soldiers, explorers and adventurers who conquered and colonized the territories that created the Spanish Empire in the 15th-17th cunturies; but the term is also used in several European languages to describe a [[wikt:lothario|lothario]].

'''''Un demi sétier'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French Slang'') ''A small black coffee''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The usual French term for a small black coffee is ''[[wikt:demitasse|demitasse]]''. A ''sétier'' is an obsolete unit of capacity and volume. It was used before the French Revolution to express the capacity of dry substances, such as seeds and grains, and the volume of liquids. Its value varied from place to place, but the Parisian dry ''sétier'' was equal to 151.680 litres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopaedia of Scientific Units, Weights and Measures |last=Cardarelli |first=François |year=2003 |publisher=Springer |location=London |isbn=1-85233-682-X |page=582 |url=http://books.google.ie/books?id=6KCx8Ww75VkC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The liquid ''sétier'' was equivalent to about 9 litres, or to 284 millilitres, depending on the source consulted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ie/books?id=MX1FAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA505#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A.

'''sester'''.]&lt;/ref&gt; The latter would make a ''demi-sétier'' equal to about 142 ml, which is appropriate for a small cup of coffee.


'''''Il est Irlandais. Hollandais? Non fromage. Deux Irlandais, nous, Irlande, vous savez? Ah oui!.'' she thought you wanted a cheese ''hollandais'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''He's Irish. Dutch?

She thought you wanted a Dutch cheese.''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen recalls a conversation between Kevin Egan and a waitress in a Parisian restaurant.


'''''slainte !'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Errata'') ''sláinte !'' is the correct spelling.

:''Moi faire'', she said, ''tous les messieurs''. Not this ''monsieur'', I said.

In ''[[w:The Little Review|The Little Review]]'', which published an earlier draft of this chapter in 1918, the passage is printed thus:&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.lib.brown.edu/repository2/repoman.php?verb=render&amp;id=1298917764984376&amp;view=pageturner&amp;pageno=39 ''The Little Review'', Volume 5, No. 1, Page 39.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''rue de la Goutte-d'Or'''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''Street of the Drop of Gold''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[w:Goutte d'Or:|Goutte d'Or:]] is a suburb of Paris in the [[w:18th arrondissement of Paris|18th arrondissement]], named for the ancient vineyards that once produced a golden white wine here. The ''[[w:fr:Rue de la Goutte d'Or|Rue de la Goutte d'Or]]'' runs from the ''Rue Polonceau'' to 22 ''Boulevard Barbès''. Gabler italicizes this phrase.&lt;ref&gt;Gabler (1986) 36.&lt;/ref&gt;


'''rue Gît-le-Cœur'''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') A [[w:fr:Rue Gît-le-Cœur|street]] in the [[w:6th arrondissement of Paris|6th arrondissement]] of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 57.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a narrow street, close to the Left Bank of the Seine. It runs roughly paralel to the [[w:boulevard Saint-michel|boulevard Saint-michel]]. The name, which translates literally as ''Lies-the-Heart Street'', is a corruption of ''Rue Gilles le Queux'' (''Gilles the Cook Street''). Gabler italicizes the name.&lt;ref&gt;Gabler (1986) 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''the red Egyptians'''{{spaces|5}}[[w:Gypsy|Gypsies]].&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 61.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 60-61.&lt;/ref&gt; In Ireland, however, ''Gypsies'' usually refers to members of the [[w:Irish Travellers|Travelling Community]], who are ethnically Irish. In this passage Stephen is relying for his quotations and information on [[w:Richard Head|Richard Head's]] ''[[w:Slang dictionary|The Canting Academy]]'' of 1673. Head describes the Gypsies thus:

{{quote|The principal Professors of this Gibberish or Canting, I find, are a sort of People which are vulgarly called ''Gypsies''; and they do endeavour to perswade the ignorant, that they were extracted from the ''Egyptians'' ... they artificially discolour their faces, and with this tawny hew and tatterdemallion habit, they rove up and down the Country, and with the pretension of wonderful prediction, delude a many of the younger and less intelligent people.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Head, ''The Canting Academy'', London (1673), page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}


'''blued feet'''{{spaces|5}}Stephen is probably referring to the discoloration of the feet which occurs when the traditional blue dye [[w:Indigo dye|indigo]] is worked into fabrics by treading barefoot in the vats. In ancient Egypt the preparation of the indigo for the vats also involved treading.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ie/books?id=ua83AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA136&amp;lpg=PA136#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Robert James Forbes, ''Studies in Ancient Technology'' 136.]&lt;/ref&gt;


'''ruffian'''{{spaces|5}}In standard English ''ruffian'' is a pejorative term for a lawless thug. In [[w:Thieves' cant|thieves' cant]], ''ruffin'' or ''ruffian'' refers specifically to the Devil. Stephen may have confused the two. In [[w:Richard Head|Richard Head's]] ''[[w:Slang dictionary|The Canting Academy]]'', male gypsies are usually called ''rogues'' or ''coves''.


'''strolling mort'''{{spaces|5}}(''Thieves' Cant'') ''wandering wench''. In [[w:Richard Head|Richard Head's]] ''[[w:Slang dictionary|The Canting Academy]]'', ''Strowling Morts'' are described thus:

{{quote|Strowling-Morts are such as pretend to be Widdows, travelling about from County to County, making laces upon [st]aves, as Beggars tape, or the like; they are subtil Queans, hard-hearted, light-fingered, hypocritical and dissembling, and very dangerous to meet, if any ''Ruffler'' or ''Rogue'' be in their company.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Head, ''The Canting Academy'', London (1673), page 86.&lt;/ref&gt;}}


'''bing awast, to Romeville'''{{spaces|5}}(''Thieves' Cant'') ''Go away, to London''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 61.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen is quoting the first line of the seventh and final stanza of the canting song, ''The Rogue's Delight in Praise of his Strolling Mort'', which Richard Head includes in ''The Canting Academy''. ''Rome'' means ''rum'', i.e. ''excellent''; ''Romeville'' is the [[w:Thieves' cant|cant]] term for London. See below.


'''Buss'''{{spaces|5}}(''archaic'') ''Kiss''. ''[[wikt:buss|Buss]]'' is archaic English. It is not, and never has been, [[w:Thieves' cant|cant]].


'''wap in rogue's rum lingo'''{{spaces|5}}(''Thieves' cant'') ''kiss, in the excellent language of the Gypsies''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen translates the Shakespearean term ''buss'' into [[w:Thieves' cant|cant]]. On the term ''lingo'', Eric Partridge writes:

{{quote|'''lingo''' was in [the 18th century], and occ[asionally] later, a synonym of ''the slang, the flash ''(''language''); just - only just - possibly it was, for a decade, c[ant] in this specific sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of the Underworld |last=Partridge |first=Eric |year=1995 |publisher=Wordsworth Editions Ltd |location=Ware |isbn=1-85326-361-3 |page=410}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}


'''O, my dimber wapping dell'''{{spaces|5}}(''Thieves' Cant'') ''O, my pretty loving wench''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 61.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen is quoting the second line of the seventh and final stanza of the canting song, ''The Rogue's Delight in Praise of his Strolling Mort'', which Richard Head includes in ''The Canting Academy''. ''To wap'' means ''to copulate''. See below.


'''''White thy fambles ... clip and kiss'''''{{spaces|5}} (''Thieves' Cant'') This is the second stanza of the canting song, ''The Rogue's Delight in Praise of his Strolling Mort'', which Richard Head includes in ''The Canting Academy'':&lt;ref&gt;Richard Head, ''The Canting Academy'', London (1673), pp. 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''nebeneinander'''''{{spaces|5}}(''German'') ''side by side''. See [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Proteus/037|037.13]].


'''tripudium'''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') In ancient Rome, the ''[[wikt:tripudium|tripudium]]'' was a solemn ceremonial dance.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The word denotes a triple stroke, in which the Earth is stamped three times with the foot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/searchresults?q=tripudium ''Tripudium''].&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce does not italicize the word, treating it as an English borrowing.


'''''Tiens, quel petit pied!'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''My, what a small foot!''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 64.&lt;/ref&gt;


'''''diebus ac noctibus iniurias patiens ingemiscit.'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''days and nights it [Creation] sighs patiently over injustices.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Gifford |first1 = Don |last2 = Seidman |first2 = Robert J. |title = Ulysses Annotated |publisher = University of California Press |year = 1988 |page = 64}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Thornton|first1 = Weldon|title = Allusions in Ulysses |publisher = University of North Carolina Press |year = 1968 |page = 65}}&lt;/ref&gt; A quotation from the ''Commentary on the Epistle of Blessed Paul to the Romans'', long attributed to [[w:Ambrose|Saint Ambrose]] but now ascribed to a contemporary of his styled [[w:Ambrosiaster|Ambrosiaster]]. The comment is to Romans 8:22, ''For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208&amp;version=KJV Bible Gateway]&lt;br&gt;[http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/04z/z_0339-0397__Ambrosius__In_Epistolam_Beati_Pauli_Ad_Romanos__MLT.pdf.html ''In Epistolam Beati Pauli Ad Romanos]&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul's '''συστεναζει''' (''sustenazei'') means both ''sighs together'' and ''groans together''. [[w:Jerome|Saint Jerome's]] Latin translation ''ingemiscit'' also carries both meanings, ''sighs'' and ''groans''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://concordances.org/greek/4959.htm Strong's Greek.]&lt;/ref&gt; When read in context, however, Paul's point is that ''all of creation has been groaning, as though in the pangs of childbirth, right up to the present time.''

Thornton suggests that Joyce probably came across the comment &quot;in some choir manual or [[wikt:sodality manual|sodality manual]].&quot; [[w:Marsh's Library|Marsh's Library]], however, has a copy of the complete works of St Ambrose (Basle, 1506), which includes the commentary on ''Romans''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marshlibrary.ie/catalogue?key1=a&amp;uval1=Ambrose;+St.;+Bishop+of+Milan;+c.+340-97+&amp;op2=&amp;key2=&amp;uval2=&amp;coll=3&amp;adv=n ''Omnia opera; Ambrosius episcopi Mediolanensis'', F. Conradus Leontorius (editor), Basle (1506).]&lt;br&gt;[http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/bsb00008239/images/bsb00008239_00411.jpg ''In Epistolam Ad Romanos''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Prix de Paris'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') The ''[[w:Grand Prix de Paris|Grand Prix de Paris]]'' (''Great Prize of Paris'') was the most important event in French horse racing.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 65.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The mention of ''Old Father Ocean'' has reminded Stephen, perhaps, of ''[[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Proteus/038|the steeds of Mananaan]]'' See [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Nestor/032|032.17]].

Stephen is probably also punning on the story of the [[w:Judgement of Paris|Judgement of Paris]], in which the Prince of Troy awarded the ''[[w:Apple of Discord|Apple of Discord]]'' to [[w:Aphrodite|Aphrodite]], precipitating the [[w:Trojan War|Trojan War]]. Paris's prize for choosing Aphrodite was Helen of Troy.


'''beware of imitations'''{{spaces|5}}In a [[w:Palinode|palinode]] attributed to the Greek poet [[w:Stesichorus|Stesichorus]], the Trojan War was fought over a phantom Helen, while the real Helen was living in Egypt under the protection of King Proteus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/11*.html Dio Chrysostom, ''Discourses'' 11:40 ff.]&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[w:Herodotus|Herodotus]] recounts a similar tradition in his ''[[w:Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2707/pg2707.txt Herodotus, ''Histories'' 2:112.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek playwright [[w:Euripides|Euripides]] also draws upon this tradition for his drama ''[[w:Helen (play)|Helen]]'', in which Helen is reunited with her husband [[w:Menelaus|Menelaus]] when he is marooned in Egypt on his way home from Troy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Eur.+Hel.+1 Euripides, ''Helen''.]&lt;/ref&gt; This latter event, of course, is the Homeric background Joyce drew upon when he wrote the Proteus episode of ''Ulysses''.


'''''Lucifer, dico, qui nescit occasum'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''The Morning Star, I say, who knows no setting.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Gifford |first1 = Don |last2 = Seidman |first2 = Robert J. |title = Ulysses Annotated |publisher = University of California Press |year = 1988 |page = 65}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Thornton|first1 = Weldon|title = Allusions in Ulysses |publisher = University of North Carolina Press |year = 1968 |pages = 66-67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen's adapts this quotation from the [[w:Easter Vigil|Easter Vigil]], the Catholic service for [[w:Holy saturday|Holy saturday]]. The [[w:Exsultet|Exultet]] or Easter Proclamation, sung by the [[w:deacon|deacon]] before the [[w:Paschal Candle|Paschal Candle]], concludes with the words:

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|+ '''''Exultet''''' &lt;/noinclude&gt;
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
| &lt;poem&gt;
''May the early Morning Star find his flames [still burning]:''
''He, I say, the Morning Star, who knows no setting.''
''Christ your Son,''
''Who, returned from the dead, has shed his peaceful light on the human race,''
''And who lives and reigns for ever and ever.''
''Amen''
&lt;/poem&gt;
| &lt;poem&gt;
''Flammas eius lúcifer matutínus invéniat:''
''ille, inquam, Lúcifer, qui nescit occásum.''
''Christus Fílius tuus,''
''qui, regréssus ab ínferis, humáno géneri serénus illúxit,''
''et vivit et regnat in sæcula sæculórum.''
''Amen.''
&lt;/poem&gt;
|}

''Lucifer'' means ''the bringer of light'' and was applied to the [[w:Morning Star|Morning Star]] by the ancient Romans. In the ''Exultet'' it refers to the risen Christ. But Lucifer is also a name for [[w:Satan|Satan]], so Stephen's phrase can also be translated: ''Lucifer, I say, who knows no fall.''

See '''Isaiah 14:12:''' ''How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer,&lt;ref&gt;[http://concordances.org/hebrew/1966.htm Strong's Hebrew.]&lt;/ref&gt; son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2014&amp;version=KJV Bible Gateway]&lt;/ref&gt;

See '''Luke 10:18:''' ''I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010&amp;version=KJV Bible Gateway]&lt;/ref&gt;


'''''Già'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''Indeed''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 66.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gifford, Stephen is using the word to express impatience; he feels that he has spent enough time wandering across Sanymount Strand and is urging himself to get a move on.

'''''Là ci darem'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''There we shall join [hands]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 77.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 73.&lt;/ref&gt; These are the opening words of the [[w:Duettino|duettino]] ''Là ci darem la mano'', Act I, Number 7 of [[w:Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] comic opera ''[[w:Don Giovanni|Don Giovanni]]'', in which the Don, a sexual predator, begins his seduction of the peasant Masetto's young bride Zerlina. The opera occupies Bloom's mind for the rest of the day on account of the similarity between his and Masetto's predicaments:&lt;ref&gt;[[s:it:Don Giovanni/Atto Primo/Scena nona|''Don Giovanni''' Act 1, Scene 9.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Voglio e non vorrei'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''I want to but I wouldn't like to''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 77.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 73&lt;/ref&gt; Bloom has misremembered Zerlina's line. He will correct it in ''[[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Hades/090|Hades]]'', but he continually makes the same mistake throughout the day. It has been suggested that Bloom is thinking of a pair of lines spoken by Don Giovanni's servant Leporello in the opening scene: ''Voglio far il gentiluomo/E non voglio più servir'' (''I want to be a gentleman/And I no longer wish to serve'').&lt;ref&gt;[[s:it:Don Giovanni/Atto Primo/Scena_prima|''Don Giovanni''' Act 1, Scene 1.]]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Circe/417|Circe]]'', two pages before repeating the mistake, Bloom addresses Molly with the words ''At your service''.

Zerlina's ''Vorrei e non vorrei'' (''I would like to and I wouldn't like to'') might be more loosely translated as: ''I would like to, but I shouldn't'', or ''Should I or shouldn't I?''.


'''Wonder if she pronounces that right : ''voglio'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') The word ''voglio'' (''I want to'') is pronounced [ˈvɔʎo] in [[W:International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], (vOLo in [[w:Extended Speech Assessment Methods Phonetic Alphabet|X-SAMPA]], ''vawl-yo'' phonetically). Of course, this is all irrelevant to Molly, who won't be called upon to sing this word.

== Overview ==

'''''Abraxas Malfoy''''' was grandfather to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]], and father to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]]. He knew [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Horace Slughorn]] and died of Dragon Pox, presumably at an old age.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

In their first [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] class, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]] asks [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Slughorn]] if he remembers his grandfather. Slughorn replies that he does and is sorry to hear of his death but it was not unexpected, &quot;Dragon Pox, at his age&quot; before turning away.

Professor Slughorn mentions Draco's grandfather again in the Slug Club Christmas party.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Apparently distant friends with Horace Slughorn, who is probably about his age; they may have attended Hogwarts at the same time.

== Analysis ==

We know that Professor Slughorn is more than a bit of a social climber, and that he seems to cut off those people who he feels don't offer him an &quot;in&quot; into the higher-flying parts of society. The fact that he acknowledges knowing Abraxas Malfoy would indicate that there was some fame or accomplishment in Abraxas' past to attract Slughorn's attention. We never find out, though, exactly what that accomplishment is.

Abraxas is brought into the story, as far as we can see, only to cast a light on Slughorn and some specifics of his social climbing. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 7|an earlier chapter]], we see that Slughorn is willing to cultivate [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marcus Belby|Marcus Belby]] as long as he has hopes of making a connection with Belby's still living famous uncle. As Abraxas is no longer alive and does not represent a useful connection. Slughorn is not particularly interested in those who had connections to him. We suspect that this particular shallowness in Slughorn's character is one of the things that Harry dislikes, and one of the reasons Harry avoids the Slug Club.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Hunger Games ==

The Hunger Games is a young adult science fiction novel by Suzanne Colins. There are three novels in the series: The Hunger Games, Catching Fire and Mockingjay.

It is set in a dystopian, post-apocalyptic future in a country called Panem in the remains of the USA, separated into fourteen administrative regions. There are thirteen districts (District 1, District 2, District 3 etc.) and the capital, Capitol. Each district specializes in something, e.g. mining, fishing, electronics, and supplies this to the Capitol. Seventy four years before The Hunger Games the districts rebelled against the Capitol, but were beaten, all apart from District 13 which was supposedly destroyed, and now have to pay the price of their rebellion. Every child in each district is entered into &quot;the reaping&quot;. Their names are submitted and two are drawn out at random, one boy and one girl, and they will have to compete in The Hunger Games. This is a TV program to be watched in the Capitol, each of the twenty four contestants is placed into an unknown arena and have to kill each other. Only one will survive the games, the rest of them are all killed, and will then live a life of luxury in their district, although afterwards most turn to drugs. The winners have to mentor the next participants.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I found this a little helpful while doing some research for my history homework, but I think it could have given more information for examples of civilizations or other things. But overall i think it was OK. It should include pictures. But its helped me quite a lot.
So I thank WikiBooks.

      <comment>/* Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone */ first book whole book layout; notes on the entire series</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">= Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone =

''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' (released as ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' outside the US) is the first book in a seven-book series. Published in the UK in June 1997, in the US in September 1998, the book had been making the rounds of the publishers for a year before it was finally accepted by Bloomsbury. The seven books have done what was considered impossible: in the age of electronic entertainment, video games and the internet, they inspired almost an entire generation of young readers to buy and read that most archaic of forms, words printed on paper. The seven books have been turned into eight films, among other works, and have inspired an extremely large and active fan base.

Each of the first five books of the series largely stands on its own, though there is a single story line that unites the seven of them into one planned, cohesive story. The last two books, each with its own story line, are more closely linked. The series follows the adventures of Harry Potter, aged 11 at the start of the adventure, as he discovers his own Wizard heritage, finds his place in the hidden Wizard society of England, and learns to manage his power to defeat Voldemort, the most feared wizard of all time, who has returned from apparent death to take over the Wizarding government of England.

The first book, of course, is the hook for the series. If the book does not engage your attention, you will not read onwards, so the opening chapter of the first book must entice you to read further, and the opening book must intrigue you enough that you are willing to wait for subsequent volumes. ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' clearly manages this, being intriguing enough to snare even readers who are well past the first flush of youth, while still being written on a level that is accessible to readers of the same age as our hero.

The first chapter introduces us to the Dursley family, making a great point of how aggressively normal they are. Late that night, a character appears near their house, uses a device to extinguish all the street lights, then speaks to a cat who turns into an woman. The woman is evidently named Professor Minerva McGonagall, while the extravagantly bearded gentleman who put out the street lights, and who the others seem to defer to, bears the name of Albus Dumbledore. They are shortly joined by a giant of a man, one Hagrid, who appears from the sky on a flying motorcycle. The three of them leave a foundling child on the Dursleys' doorstep, and depart into the night, Dumbledore re-illuminating the streetlights as he goes.

How does this chapter manage to entice us to read the rest of the story? First, we are introduced to the idea of an entire second world, marked by strange clothes, notably robes. With the appearance of Dumbledore, also robed, and his quite obvious magical abilities, we gather that the world we are about to be introduced to is one of wizards and witches. We are not told of this, it is never explicitly outlined; Dumbledore and McGonagall take their magical abilities for granted, they are not pushed into the reader's face, they simply occur and the reader notes them in passing. Events of the previous eleven years, and of the previous night, are alluded to but not laid out in detail; we learn that a great villain has been defeated by this infant, and suspect that we are embarking on the story of his growing up. We also see McGonagall's resistance to placing Harry with these &quot;muggles&quot;, whatever those might be, and have to wonder why that would be happening.

What this chapter does, therefore, is awaken our curiosity. The character of Dumbledore is sketched in; he seems the wise elder, but there are odd irregularities in his behavior that we cannot yet analyze &amp;mdash; we do not expect his liking for &quot;lemon sherbert&quot; candies, for instance, and his delight at recognizing the cat is also somewhat surprising. McGonagall is less intriguing in herself, but we suspect that there may be an interesting interplay between her and Dumbledore, and her ability to change into a cat also evokes wonder. Harry quite obviously has already played a significant role in this undiscovered world, and we are curious to see how he will get along with the Dursleys, who already are seen to have serious issues with this world. A much larger story is hinted at, and we are driven to find out more about it.

In the same manner, the book as a whole, while complete in itself, whets our appetite for more. We learn that the villain, Voldemort, though widely believed to be dead, seems to still exist and retain some semblance of life; though he is defeated in this book, we believe it is not a complete defeat, and we expect that we will see more of him. We learn that Dumbledore is a complex character with significant hidden depth, and want to learn more about him as well. We see Harry's maturation through the course of this book, as he learns his place in Wizard society, and are driven to find out how he grows up and into his powers and confidence in himself. Additionally, we are throughout given glimpses of a vast conspiracy, a hidden world of magic that runs parallel to our own &quot;muggle&quot; world, a world that we would like to believe in and that we want to learn more about.

We should emphasize two major factors in the success of the story as a whole, spanning the seven books. First, of course, is the overall story arc, in which someone who believes himself to be nothing becomes a hero, saving a world. This is a very difficult plot arc to make work. While the rags-to-riches story is one of humanity's oldest and favorite yarns, it is far too easy to over-simplify. The hero cannot simply be given the keys to the kingdom, he has to earn them; he has to grow into his powers, and his responsibility, in a way that is true to his nature. We see this in the Harry Potter story, as he is faced by, and by repeatedly extending himself conquers, a succession of ever-stronger enemies. 

And secondly, the characters have to be realistic, not necessarily likeable, but showing that they are not simple cardboard props, present to speak their lines, and little else. The Harry Potter series is a prime example of this, as nearly every character who we see at any length is shown to react in ways that are based on some inner character, rather than simply as puppets of the author. Examples are Lucius Malfoy, who could have been a simple villain, but shows that he cares for his family after his prestige is lost; Draco Malfoy, Harry's nemesis, who again shows more depth in later books than the simple bully that he appears to be early on; and the Auror Tonks, who has romantic issues unrelated to the main story that show more of her character.

Note that there is another study, going into significantly more depth on the series' literary merits, elsewhere on Wikibooks. While not designed for the budding author of Young Adult books, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]] may be of use to the author looking to understand the Potter phenomenon.

=Introduction=
{{Book Search|prefix=From Data to Insight}}
“...what is the use of a book,&quot; thought Alice, &quot;without pictures...?”&lt;br /&gt;
This book teaches the principles of transforming data into insights:
# All data represent one of 3 dimensions: WHAT | WHEN | WHERE?
# Every datagraphic visualizes a relationship among the dimensions.
# There is an appropriate visualization for every relationship.
# The visualization should be efficiently designed.
# The design should reveal the insight.

=Data=
A common approach to the treatment of data is that they are at the bottom of a hierarchy:
#Wisdom
#Knowledge
#Information
#Data
whose lower levels are more 'dense' and less 'useful' and whose higher levels are more 'reduced' and abstract. This book deals mainly with the lowest three levels: how to transform data - largely through visualization - into insightful knowledge about the how the world seems to work.
==Relationships==
==Numbers==
==Geometry==

=The Dimensions of Data=
=Phenomena=
We begin with the idea of discrete objects that are enumerable (can be counted) to yield a single number but perhaps measured in many ways. In what follows these objects won't be divided into their components.
As shown in the exhibit, the fundamental data distinction is between numbers and what could be called labels.[[Image:measurement.jpg|thumb|a simple measurement hierarchy]] The simplest kinds of numbers are the integers '''I''', which are used to count objects. As the number of objects becomes large (say &gt; 100) the difference between their counts becomes relatively small so that these counts become nearly continuous. Truly continuous numbers—the real numbers '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;—can assume all possible values.
Labels (sometimes called nominal values or factors) are used to distinguish objects without measuring an amount or any specific numeric quality, although labels can be ordered (&quot;do not like&quot;, &quot;indifferent&quot;, &quot;like&quot;). Counts can play the roles of labels when the values are small (e.g. single-person v. 2-person v. &gt;2-person families). [[w:Combinatorics|Combinatorics]] deals with how labeling can be used to collect the objects into various 'bins' whose counts will be discussed in data [[From Data to Insight#Description|description]] below.

It is important to know what kind of measurements are being dealt with because there are descriptive and relational methods appropriate to each kind.
Let's examine a few examples, in the present case from the field of environmental analysis.
* The number of trees in a [[w:quadrat|quadrat]] is an integer ranging from 0 to less than infinity.
* The weight of a soil sample is a real number greater than 0 (although a sample could have zero weight, the question arises as to whether it is a sample at all, and, if so, whether there are therefore infinite such samples).
* The proportion of Nitrates in a water sample measured in parts per million is a real number resulting from the act of division.
* The magnitude of an earthquake is a real number, but because such numbers come from [[w:Long Tail|long-tailed distributions]], logarithms are often used.
* A land cover class ('forest', 'water', 'cropland', 'urban') is a label associated with no number, although each class could be assigned an arbitrary integer (say 2, 4, 1, 3). Sometimes integers are used to label measurements, but these numbers (sometimes called 'keys' in database terminology) are identifiers and cannot be described further; moreover, they should be the first column of the [[From Data to Insight#Description|data matrix]].
A particularly complicated kind of measurement results in various kinds of categories, which require often sophisticated analytical techniques. One example would be assigning a human patient to the class of patients suffering from [[w:West Nile Virus|West Nile Virus]], which can be considered an anatomical condition (brain inflammation), an infection by a specific Flavivirus, or a collection of symptoms (fever, etc.). Measurement problem - issues of reliability and confidentiality - are among the reasons why epidemiological data description is so challenging.
It is useful to explore some of the unusual conditions that arise in the treatment of real numbers.
* Zero arises when there's nothing to count (as in a treeless region or an image pixel receiving no photons), or as the length of an instant of time (&quot;2011-11-24 13:02:36.032 EST&quot;, where only milliseconds are shown).
* Negative numbers are needed in e.g. spatial data to show altitude below sea level or angle below the equator, in time data to show years before the present, or phenomena to show temperature below freezing.
* If some standard value is known then a 'rate' is computed most simply by dividing a measurement by that standard, as in a proportion of the whole or a percentage increase.
* Finally there often arise unusual cases, where a measurement is missing (NA = not available or not applicable) or infinite (a ratio resulting from the division by zero).
[[Image:wiki_Numbers.png|thumb|the 'behavior' of various kinds of numbers]]
Critical to describing data is understanding how they behave. The exhibit shows that the fundamental continuum is between discrete and continuous measurements; if one keeps track of where a given measurement is on this continuum the appropriate descriptive approach should be clearer.

===Description===
Although most of this book will discuss how to visualize relationships between different kinds of measurements, much of analysis is concerned with simple description.
We begin with the basic data matrix, as in the table below
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;ID       NOMINAL  REGULAR  INTEGER  RATIONAL
-------------------------------------------
Sigma       D        28       2       9.1
Gamma       B        29       7       9.7
Delta       B        30       6       7.6
Kappa       C        31       8       7.5
Mu          D        32       8       9.8
Beta        A        33       3       4.2
Pi          D        34       6       4.7
Epsilon     D        35       4       4.8
Tau         C        36       8       4.2
Lambda      C        37      10       2.0
Alpha       A        38       9       5.8
Rho         A        39       1       4.2&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
which is a 12 x 5 matrix of measurements that illustrate the key distinctions discussed so far:
*The ID variable is a unique label that identifies each row.
*NOMINAL is a not necessarily unique label consisting of a single alphabetic character, although it could easily be a number, or longer name.
*REGULAR is a variable that increments in unit steps, and so could be either an index (the second row could be the 29th 'case) or a time stamp (year 1928).
*INTEGER is a non-unique whole number that might be counting something.
*RATIONAL is a real number that is a true measurement, say of wind speed in knots (and note that 'knots per hour' is incorrect unless you mean acceleration!). 
The above table is a useful illustration of where to begin with data visualization. It might be the complete data matrix (although 12 rows isn't very much) that you want to present in a report, in which case this is a clear template to use. Or the matrix might just be a sample of the full dataset; and - provided this sampling is indicated - the format is also useful. Finally, the table might be presenting statistics for 12 variables. In each of these cases I have presented a simple and clearly organized template.
It's obviously very important to understand the data and to be completely clear what the data matrix represents, particularly: the numbers of rows and columns, the role of each column, and what it represents. Once this is clear, you can turn to the problem of describing each of the columns or variables. Each kind of measurement allows of its own set of descriptive statistics.
Descriptive statistics present basic facts about your data. They are of two types: nonparametric and parametric, and they are easy to understand.
==== Nonparametric statistics ====
The range is the simplest description of your data: what are the smallest and largest values attained? For the 3rd column of the data above it's easy to see that REGULAR ranges from 28 to 39, INTEGER from 1 to 10, and RATIONAL FROM 2.0 TO 9.8. For a larger dataset you can sort the numbers and choose the smallest and largest. These numbers will help determine the axes of any plots that are drawn.
The next statistic to examine is the [[w:Mode (statistics)|mode]], the most common value in the list. In a bar chart (the most appropriate visualization) the mode will have the longest bar.&lt;/br&gt;
[[image:d2i_Bar_chart.png]]&lt;br /&gt;

The above exhibit is about the simplest visual description of the NOMINAL variable. Note that the vertical axis shows the values ordered by their frequencies, so you can easily see which values are the most and least common.

      <text xml:space="preserve">God's will and obedience!

There are three nouns and a conjunction here! To understand this whole sentence, if it is one, we shall understand each one of them first and then juxtapose them as proposed and see if they make any sense in that order.

First noun is ''God''.To understand this concept (Yes, it is just a concept of one's mind of something that doesn't fit in any mind!), one take a look at [[Philosophy_of_Religion/Does_God_exist?|Does God exist?]] or [[Philosophy_of_Religion/Creator/destroyer|Creator/destroyer]]

Now let us come to His ''will''. If one understood ''God'' from the above references, then one would know his ''will'' too! You will realize that God and His will are not two separate and different things, and nor God stands apart from you like an object, a vacuum cleaner or a hammer or something else! So god's will is a funny meaningless expression, something like Ocean's wave! How self-standing and how extraneous is wave of an Ocean? So is the will of God.

Now comes the problematic word ''obedience!'' Now who obeys whom, when there are no two entities? Neither god, nor you but just One, the God, just You! So obedience is a meaningless word in this context. When understanding matures, what remains is mere execution of harmonious actions without appropriation of the outcomes to one's own self. There neither should or will remain a sense of ownership in doing, nor an expectation of any particular outcome for one's effort, but will be accompanied by a gracious acceptance of whatever finally transpires. The calmness and the serenity that is never lost even in that commotion of intense effort is the best possible meaning for obedience. And if one wants to call that obedience, yes, that could be the best befitting definition to this last piece of the puzzle.

At the end we come to ''and''. This word is for dramatization, that falls out of the thinking that something exalted being stated in the sentence, while in reality whole thing never made any sense!

Now go back to the sentence and contemplate. You will know the meaning!

This lesson will focus on broadening your vocabulary, allowing you to say short sentences and understanding the structure of Hawaiian.

==Vocabulary==

ke kula -school

ka 'ohana -family

ka lani -heaven/sky

ke kanaka -man

ke aloha -love

ka wahine -woman

ka honua -earth

ka makua -parent

ke keiki -child

ka haumana -student

=== Adjectives ===
li'ili'i -little

nui -big

nani -pretty

pupuka -ugly

māluhiluhi -tired

ma'i -sick

===Verbs===

hele -go

'ai -eat

hele mai -come

moe -sleep

hana -work

holo -run

==Review==

As you have learned in lesson 1, &quot;Aia&quot; is placed at the beginning of a sentence to show the subject's location (when or where).
     ex) Aia ka pua ma ke kula.
         (location) The flower (is) at the school.

     -Notice how there is no word for &quot;to be&quot; verbs in Hawaiian; it all depends on the position of
      a word in the sentence.
     ex) Ka pua li'ili'i (the little flower) is a part of a sentence, while
         Li'ili'i ka pua'a. (The flower is little) demonstrates a whole sentence.
     -Notice how &quot;ka pua'a&quot; went from the beginning to the end.

Next, let's look at, &quot;Nani ke keiki&quot;.
This means, the girl is beautiful, but literally translates to, &quot;Beautiful the girl&quot; because the adjective is in front.
For future references, note that the adjective comes after the noun it describes.


===Ke vs. Ka===

In Hawaiian, there are two ways to express the definite article (the). Ka is used most of the time, before every word not starting with k, e, a, or o.

===Pronouns===
'''Wau or au''' translate as I
''''Oe''' means you (singular)
''''O ia''' means he, she or it.

==Noun Announcers==
Noun announcers basically come before a noun in a sentence, announcing that it is coming. Every noun is preceded by a noun announcer, most of the time, it being &quot;ka&quot; or &quot;ke&quot;. Along with ka and ke, other announcers include 'o, kēia (this), kēlā (that), ko'u (my), kou (your), and kona (his/her).

==Practice Phrases==

Translate into Hawaiian for practice:

'''''dolce far niente'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''pleasant idleness''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 85.&lt;/ref&gt; The literal translation of this common Italian expression is ''[[wikt:dolce far niente|sweet doing nothing]]''.


'''Azotes'''{{spaces|5}} ''[[wikt:azote|Azote]]'' is an archaic name for [[w:Nitrogen|nitrogen]], the commonest constituent of the Earth's atmosphere. The French chemist [[w:Antoine Lavoisier|Antoine Lavoisier]] called this gas ''azote'', from the Greek roots ἀ (a) and ζωή (zōē) meaning ''not-life'', because it could not support life. Most plants, however, require nitrogen, which is probably what Bloom is thinking of. He seems to believe that such plants are called ''azotes'', though I have not found any references to support such a belief.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.org/stream/popularcyclopae05carpgoog William Benjamin Carpenter, ''Popular Cyclopaedia of Natural Science'' (1844), &quot;Animal Physiology&quot;, p. 25.] ''... most plants require the element nitrogen or azote as one of the materials of their growth....''&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that he has confused ''azote'' with ''[[wikt:exotic|exotic]]'', a plant that is not native to the local ecosystem. Exotics are to be found in the hothouse in Dublin's Botanic Gardens, alluded to by Bloom immediately after ''azotes''. Richard Ellmann referred to such near misses as ''Bloomisms''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ulysses on the Liffey |last=Ellmann |first=Richard |year=1984 |publisher=Faber and Faber Limited |location=London |isbn=0-571-13309-6 |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Voglio e non'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') See [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Calypso/061|061.33]]. Bloom has repeated his earlier mistake.


'''''Là ci darem la mano ... la'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''There we shall join hands''. See [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Calypso/061|061.20]]. Bloom's ''La la lala la la'' matches the musical rhythm of the following line, whose words he has possibly forgotten: ''Là mi dirai di sì'' (''There you shall say &quot;Yes&quot; to me'').

'''S. J.'''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''Societas Iesu'', the [[w:Society of Jesus|Society of Jesus]] or Jesuits. In Latin an initial ''I'' followed by a vowel is interchangeable with ''J''.


'''D. D.'''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''Divinitatis Doctor'', [[w:Doctor of Divinity|Doctor of Divinity]]. It signifies that a [[w:doctorate|doctorate]] in [[w:divinity|divinity]] has been conferred on Dr William J. Walsh.


'''Ecce Home.'''{{spaces|5}}(''Erratum'') Ecce Homo. This has been corrected in every edition of ''Ulysses'' I have examined, but ''Ecce Home'' is a common mistake made by those not familiar with the Latin language. It is precisely the sort of mistake Bloom might make.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Ellmann |first1 = Richard |title = Ulysses on the Liffey |publisher = Faber and Faber |year = 1984 |page = 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;


[[File:Munkácsy-Ecce homo.jpg|thumb|right|''Ecce Homo'']]
'''Ecce Homo'''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''Behold the man''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Gifford |first1 = Don |last2 = Seidman |first2 = Robert J. |title = Ulysses Annotated |publisher = University of California Press |year = 1988 |page = 92}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Thornton|first1 = Weldon|title = Allusions in Ulysses |publisher = University of North Carolina Press |year = 1968 |pages = 82-83}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[w:Gospel of John|Gospel of John]], these words are spoken by [[w:Pontius Pilate|Pontius Pilate]] when he presents Jesus to the people:''Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ioannes+19&amp;version=VULGATE John 19:5]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899 a painting by the Hungarian artist [[w:Mihály Munkácsy|Mihály Munkácsy]] entitled ''Ecce Homo'' (1896) was exhibited in the [[w:Royal Hibernian Academy|Royal Hibernian Academy]] on [[w:Abbey Street|Lower Abbey Street]]. It depicted Christ wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. In September of the same year the seventeen-year-old Joyce wrote a short essay about the painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Joyce |first1 = James |title = Occasional, Critical and Political Writing |editor = Kevin Barry |publisher = Oxford University Press |year = 2000 |pages = 17-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that Bloom is referring to this painting.


'''''Corpus'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''Body''. In the [[w:Tridentine Mass|Latin Mass]], each time the priest offers the [[w:Eucharist|consecrated bread]] to a communicant, he says ''Corpus Domini nostri Jesu Christi custodiat animam tuam in vitam æternam. Amen.'' (''May the Body of Our Lord Jesus Christ preserve your soul for eternal life. Amen'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/missale-romanum-pdf.html ''Missale Romanum'', ''Ritus Servandus'' X:6 (Page 73).]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to John 19:20, the inscription was written in Hebrew (which probably means [[w:Aramaic|Aramaic]]), Latin and Greek.

The original Greek '''ο ναζωραιος''' has been translated ''[[w:Nazareth|of Nazareth]]'' and ''[[w:Nazarene (title)|the Nazarene]]''.

'''''vibrato'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''vibrated''. In English ''[[w:Vibrato|vibrato]]'' is a technical term which describes the musical technique of quickly and repeatedly raising and lowering the pitch of a note by a small amount in order to impart an emotional expressiveness to the note. The practice is particularly associated with vocal music and [[w:String instrument|string technique]]. Some types of [[w:Pipe organ|organ]] can produce a similar effect by altering the pressure of the air passing through the pipes. Bloom is probably thinking of the [[w:Vox humana|vox humana]] [[w:Organ stop|stop]] on a church organ. This stop uses a [[w:Tremulant|tremulant]] (or tremolant) to achieve a vibrato effect. ''Vox humana'' is Latin for ''Human voice'', so Bloom is justified in saying that, ''he knew how to make that instrument talk....''


'''''Stabat Mater'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''The Mother Stood''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 95.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 85.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[w:Stabat Mater|Stabat Mater]]'' are the opening words and traditional title of a 13th-century hymn to the [[w:Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]]. The hymn is sometimes known as the ''Stabat Mater Dolorosa'' (''The Sorrowful Mother Stood'') to distinguish it from another work with the same opening. It recounts the suffering of Christ's mother during his [[w:Passion (Christianity)|Passion]]. It has been set to music several times.


'''''Quis est homo?'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''Who is the man?''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 95.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 85.&lt;/ref&gt; These are the opening words of the third stanza of the ''[[w:Stabat Mater|Stabat Mater]]''. In [[w:Gioachino Rossini|Rossini's]] setting, ''[[w:Stabat Mater (Rossini)|Quis est homo?]]'' is a duet for soprano and mezzo-soprano.


'''''Gloria'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''Glory''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 96.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 85.&lt;/ref&gt; The opening word and traditional title of the hymn ''[[w:Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria in excelsis Deo]]'' (''Glory to God in the highest''), the Greater Doxology or Angelic Hymn which forms part of the [[w:Order of Mass|Ordinary]] of the [[w:Tridentine Mass|Latin Mass]].

The ''Gloria'' in the spurious ''Mozart's Twelfth Mass'' is still a popular piece with amateur choirs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Mozart%27s+Twelfth+Mass&amp;oq=Mozart%27s+Twelfth+Mass&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=3675l16055l0l16581l21l21l0l15l15l0l172l828l1.5l6l0 YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aq. Dist. Fol. Laur. Te Virid.'''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin abbreviations'') ''[[wikt:aqua|Aqua]] [[wikt:distillata|Distillata]]. [[wikt:folia|Folia]] [[wikt:lauri|Lauri]]. Thea [[wikt:viridis|Viridis]].'' (''Distilled Water. Laurel Leaves. Green Tea.)''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloom is reading some of the labels on the apothecary's jars of ingredients. Several of these and similar jars are still on display in Sweny's Chemist.

[[w:Distilled water|Distilled water]] is used by pharmacists as a [[w:diluent|diluent]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ripplefxwater.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=18&amp;Itemid=32 Distilled Water in Pharmacy.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaves of the [[w:Bay leaf|bay laurel]] (''Laurus nobilis'') have several medicinal uses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medicineherbs.net/medicinal-herbs/laurel Laurel.]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Thea viridis'' L. is one of the older scientific names for the Chinese tea herb from which [[w:green tea|green tea]] is made. ''[[w:Camellia sinensis|Camellia sinensis]]'' is the currently preferred name. It too has medicinal uses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medicineherbs.net/medicinal-herbs/green-tea Green Tea.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Is Joyce's ''Te'' an error for ''The.''?


'''''Peau d'Espagne'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''Spanish skin''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 98.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[w:Peau d'Espagne|Peau d'Espagne]]'' is a perfume made of flower and spice oils. Presumably Bloom is mentally answering Martha Clifford's inquiry concerning Molly's perfume. In ''[[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Penelope/713|Penelope]]'', Molly will recall using a cheap and inferior form of ''Peau d'Espagne'' when she was living with her father in Gibraltar.

'''''fidus Achates'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''faithful Achates''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 105.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 90.&lt;/ref&gt; [[w:Achates|Achates]] is the friend and companion of [[w:Aeneas|Aeneas]] in [[w:Virgil|Virgil's]] epic poem the ''[[w:Aeneid|Aeneid]]''. He is referred to by this phrase on three occasions. In the context of an episode called ''Hades'', the most relevant instance occurs at ''Aeneid'' 6:158, shortly before Aeneas descends into the Underworld.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0054%3Abook%3D6%3Acard%3D156 ''Aeneid'' 6:156-182]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Achates'' has become a by-word for an intimate companion, though the name is often used ironically.

In English ''fidus Achates'' is pronounced [ˈfaɪdəs æˈkeɪtiːz].

      <comment>/* Server software */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The performance of OpenClinica as an application is dependent upon numerous software, load and hardware variables - those on the client's machine, in the network and on the server.  This page is intended as a guide to where these issues can be explored.

== The effect of CRF size ==
The speed of CRF pages can be affected by the number of fields in a section (also known as a tab or page).  Long sections download slowly due to the fact that for each item in the active section, several pieces of javascript must be downloaded and parsed.  If a CRF is split into two or more sections than this improves the loading speed of the CRF considerably.

The download speed of a large section can also be improved if a reverse proxy (see below) is used to compress the page.

== The client machine ==
A client machine that is slow or that is running complex programs in parallel with the web browser can result in the web pages displaying slowly.  The client machine's net connection may also be problematic if the machine if connected via an unstable wireless connection.

== The network ==
The further the client machine is away from the server and the worse the network connection, the longer communication will take between the two, to transmit even small pages and simple graphics.  Having the server halfway around the world from the client (e.g. a client in Australia and the server in the UK) can add 1/3rd of a second to communication time (that's 2/3rds second for a round trip).

== The server ==
=== Server software ===
The server uses a number of pieces of software to respond to clients, which respond reasonably well in the default configuration, but can be optimised in different ways:

*OpenClinica
** [http://blog.openclinica.com/2012/12/03/openclinica-3-1-3-now-available/ Recent versions of OpenClinica] include performance optimisations, including '40% faster turn times' on an optimised system (read a related [https://mailman.openclinica.com/pipermail/users/2012-December/007946.html discussion])
** OpenClinica has no configuration for performance optimisation (though there is a [[OpenClinica_User_Manual/PageAnalysis|'wishlist']] for further improvements).  If OpenClinica is running smoothly, the amount of time it spends writing data to the logs can be reduced. Warning: only do this when you experience no problems! In the datainfo.properties, under '''11 - Logging configuration''' change the entry '''logLevel''' to '''logLevel = warn''' or for the brave among us to '''logLevel = error'''. As soon as anything unusual happens, changed it back to '''info'''.
*Tomcat - the OpenClinica documentation describes how to install Tomcat, which serves up web pages.  Tomcat can be optimised:
**See OpenClinica's optimisation instructions for [https://docs.openclinica.com/3.1/installation/installation-linux#content-title-5460 Linux] or for [https://docs.openclinica.com/3.1/installation/installing-openclinica-windows#content-title-5461 Windows]
**[[OpenClinica_User_Manual/UsingAReverseProxy|Compression (and SSL) can be enabled on Tomcat itself]] without using a reverse proxy
**Other software can be used to augment Tomcat in at least a couple of ways:
***Installing a reverse proxy such as Nginx (see [[OpenClinica_User_Manual/UsingAReverseProxy|Using Nginx as a secure reverse proxy for OpenClinica]]) to deal with SSL, content caching and compression.
***Installing Tomcat/Apache's [http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/apr.html APR] to speed up SSL.
*Database - for Postgresql see [[OpenClinica_User_Manual/OptimisingPostgreSQL|Optimising PostgreSQL]].  Alternatively, [http://docs.oracle.com/ Oracle's docs] have sections on optimisation

When a server is configured optimally (with sufficient memory allocated as in the references above), [https://mailman.openclinica.com/pipermail/users/2012-December/007946.html this thread] suggests OpenClinica is primarily limited by the performance of Postgres' caching, and the speed of the processor it runs on.  Further improvements might be gained by optimisations to OpenClinica itself.

=== Server hardware ===
==== Minimal ====
See the [https://community.openclinica.com/project/openclinica#systemreqs Compatibility and System Requirements section of the Download OpenClinica page] in the OpenClinica documentation for basic hardware server requirements.

==== Working ====
OpenClinica have a page on [https://docs.openclinica.com/3.1/technical-documents/hardware-software-stack-considerations Hardware &amp; Software Stack Considerations] that suggests a 'base configuration that works well' of: Quad Core Xeon Processor 2.0Ghz or better, 4 GB RAM, 4 x 73 GB HD.
This is the same specification referred to in a mail in November 2011 by an OpenClinica employee on what he considered a [https://mailman.openclinica.com/pipermail/users/2011-November/006112.html 'a pretty nice setup to run OpenClinica on'].  He highlighted the speed of the disk array as a key factor in performance.

==== Optimal ====
OpenClinica Optimized(tm) Hosting ([http://blog.openclinica.com/2011/10/07/clinical-trials-cloud/ Clinical Trials in the Cloud]) is architected by Shaun Martin (see the [https://www.openclinica.com/new-cloud-enabled-openclinica-optimized%E2%84%A2-hosting-raises-bar-openclinica-performance-and-reliabilit-0 press release]), and uses Fusion-io's hybrid disk technology (see below) and multiple redundancy.

==== The theory ====
*Memory requirements: As of OpenClinica 3.1.x, Tomcat can use up to 2GB of RAM (see server software section above), a PostgreSQL database can use up to 2GB of RAM (see [[OpenClinica_User_Manual/OptimisingPostgreSQL|Optimising PostgreSQL]]) and Oracle's requirements vary.
*Disk space requirements: The space taken up by the application and PostgreSQL are around 1GB (Oracle's requirements will vary).  Tomcat consumes about 400MB of disk space, and each Tomcat instance takes up around 100MB of space (assuming CRFs don't include uploaded file attachments).  Java consumes about 250MB of space, and PostgreSQL 250MB of space.  Actual data entry will increase usage, but as the data is generally text (except in the case of CRF file attachements), the space used is unlikely to be huge.
*Disk speed requirements: Faster disks, such as SSDs (solid state disks) and high speed hard disks will speed up the response times of PostgreSQL or Oracle.
**For example, OpenClinica Optimized(tm) Hosting ([http://blog.openclinica.com/2011/10/07/clinical-trials-cloud/ Clinical Trials in the Cloud]) uses Fusion-io's hybrid disk technology (SSDs in combination with regular hard disks) to improve database performance - 'data extracts run up to 10x faster'.
**In a posting to the OpenClinica user list about testing SSDs, Michael Bluett reported that SSDs [https://mailman.openclinica.com/pipermail/users/2012-December/007946.html &quot;didn't seem to give any benefit&quot;] on an optimised system, with Marco van Zwetselaar suggesting that this might be due to 'having plenty of memory (and allocating it to PostgreSQL), which would then mostly operate from its cache'.
**In a posting to the OpenClinica user list about starting to use SSDs, Krister Kristianson reported faster performance, that [https://mailman.openclinica.com/pipermail/users/2012-January/006588.html 'What took up to 10 seconds now takes less than 1 second'].
**When reporting a slow page in issuetracker, 'dannyl' reported a 2.5-3x speed increase, saying that the SSD [https://issuetracker.openclinica.com/view.php?id=12197#c42215 'has dropped response time to about 8-10s instead of 20-30s'] (login required).
*Processor requirements: Faster processors with more cores will speed up the generation of pages by Tomcat, PostgreSQL and Oracle.  If the server software is optimised and  [https://mailman.openclinica.com/pipermail/users/2012-December/007946.html pages and data mostly served from cache], then a faster processor may be the best way to improve the server's contribution to the response time
*Separate web server and database server: Separating the database server (Postgresql/Oracle) from the webserver (Tomcat) may spread the load of the server if a single server is seen to be overloaded.  But this separation introduces networking delays, which may outweigh the benefits if the webserver is frequently communicating with the database server.  As a possible warning, [https://issuetracker.openclinica.com/view.php?id=12197 a bug with version 3.1.2] (login required) describes a large number of queries to the database being made by tomcat.

=== Performance benchmarks ===
OpenClinica provide [https://docs.openclinica.com/customer-docs/openclinica-performance-benchmarks OpenClinica Performance Benchmarks] to set your expectation of how fast an instance should respond in the real world.

==Measuring and analysing performance==

Performance can be measured from the browser and remotely, highlighting the cause of any delay - is it processing on the server, or the speed of data from the server to the client?

*Browser add-ons can analyse the performance of a web site from a client's browser (as well as the performance of individual pages):
[http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/ YSlow] and [http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/ Page Speed]

*Sites such as [http://www.webpagetest.org/ webpagetest.org] and [http://tools.pingdom.com/ tools.pingdom.com] may be used to test the speed of your website from various points on the web.

==Further reading==
Web application optimization is a complex and almost open-ended topic (see [http://www.google.com/search?q=factors+in+web+application+performance]).

'''''Dominenamine'''''{{spaces|5}}Bloom has either misheard or deliberately mangled the priest's ''In nomine Domini'' (Latin: ''In the name of the Lord''), possibly conflating it with the final syllable of Paddy Dignam's name.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 117.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 98.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Roman Rite the [[w:Absolution of the dead|Absolution of the Dead]] was said over the deceased following [[w:Requiem Mass|Requiem Mass]] and before the burial. Joyce omits Dignam's Requiem (is this artistic licence, or was this an acceptable practice in Dublin in 1904?), but the Absolution begins without preamble with the prayer beginning ''Non intres ....'' So it is possible that Bloom is merely improvising.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03071a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia.]&lt;/ref&gt;


'''''Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, Domine.'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''Enter not into judgment with thy servant, O Lord.''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 118.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 99.&lt;/ref&gt; These are the opening words of the prayer, based on Psalms 143,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%20143&amp;version=KJV Psalms 143 (Vulgate 142).]&lt;/ref&gt; that begins the Absolution of the Dead:

|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;

''Lord, do not call your servant to account; for no one can stand guiltless in your presence unless you grant him forgiveness of all his sins. Therefore, we pray, that in passing judgment you will not let your sentence fall heavily on one who is commended to you by the sincere prayer of Christian faith. But with the help of your grace may this servant, who during life was sealed with the sign of the Blessed Trinity, be found worthy of escaping the doom of your vengeance. We ask this of you who live and reign forever and ever.''

''Amen''
|
''Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, Domine, quia nullus apud te justificabitur homo, nisi per te omnium peccatoru ei tribuatur remissio. Non ergo eum, quæsumus, tua judicialis sententia premat, quem tibi vera supplicatio fidei christianæ commendat. Sed gratia tua illi succurrente, mereatur, evadere judicium ultionis, qui dum viveret, insgnitus est signaculo sanctæ Trinitatis: Qui vivis et regnas in sæcula sæculorum.''

''Amen.''

'''''Et ne nos inducas in tentationem.'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''And lead us not into temptation.'' These words are taken from the [[w:Lord's Prayer|Lord's Prayer]] (Matthew 6:13 and Luke 2:4). After the ''Non Intres'', the Absolution of the Dead continues with the responsory ''[[w:Libera Me|Libera Me]]'' (''Deliver Me'') and the ''[[w:Kyrie|Kyrie Eleison]]'' (''Lord, Have Mercy''). The priest then intones aloud the opening two words of the Lord's Prayer: ''Pater Noster'' (''Our Father''). As the following lines are being recited silently, the priest sprinkles the bier with holy water with the [[w:Aspergillum|aspersorium]] and incenses the body with the [[w:thurible|thurible]]. When he has completed these tasks, the Lord's Prayer is resumed with the following responsory and prayer:

Bloom has adapted the legal term ''[[w:Habeas corpus|Habeas corpus]]'' (''May you have the body''), a writ requiring a prisoner to appear in person before a judge so that the judge may determine whether or not he has been lawfully detained .

'''''De mortuis nil nisi prius.'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''Of the dead [speak] nothing but before.''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 121.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloom is misquoting the Latin apothegm ''[[w:De mortuis nil nisi bonum|De mortuis nil nisi bonum]]'' (''Of the dead [speak] nothing but good''). He may be trying to adapt the saying to the idea he expresses in the same line, the implication being that one must wait at least two years ''before'' speaking ill of the dead.

He is probably also remembering vaguely the legal term ''[[w:Nisi prius|nisi prius]]'' (''unless previously''), which refers to the court of original jurisdiction that heard a case as distinguished from a court of appeals.

'''Last act of ''Lucia. Shall I nevermore behold thee?'' Bam! expires'''{{spaces|5}}''[[wikt:Lucia di Lammermoor|Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' (1835) is an opera in three acts by [[wikt:Gaetano Donizetti|Gaetano Donizetti]] after [[wikt:Walter Scott|Walter Scott's]] novel ''[[wikt:The Bride of Lammermoor|The Bride of Lammermoor]]'' (1819).&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 122.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 103.&lt;/ref&gt; The plot, similar to that of ''Romeo and Juliet'', concerns the tragic love of Lucia Ashton and Edgardo di Ravenswood, whose families are engaged in a deadly feud. In the final scene, when Edgardo has learned that Lucia is dying and has called for him, he sings:

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|+ '''''Lucia di Lammermoor'''''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/variations/scores/bhq5367/large/index.html ''Lucia di Lammermoor''.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
| &lt;poem&gt;''Rivederla ancor vogli' io,''
''Revederla e poscia....''
&lt;/poem&gt;
| &lt;poem&gt;''I want to see her again,''
''See her again and then....'' 
&lt;/poem&gt;
|}

But just as Edgardo is about to rush to Lucia's side, he is detained by the Calvinist chaplain Raimondo Bidebent, who informs him that Lucia is dead.

As is often the case, Bloom's memory has let him down. Edgardo does not expire after this line — his lamentations go one for several more minutes before he stabs himself and dies. What is more, Bloom's ''translation'' of the foregoing line is inaccurate. He seems to be confusing the aria with the refrain from [[wikt:Stephen Foster|Stephen Foster's]] song ''[[wikt:Gentle Annie (song)|Gentle Annie]]'' (1856): ''Shall we never more behold thee''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://imslp.org/wiki/Gentle_Annie_%28Foster,_Stephen%29 Stephen Foster, ''Gentle Annie''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''that brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage'''{{spaces|5}}Bloom misremembers (or is he being intentionally ironic?) a phrase that occurs several times in the ''[[wikt:Haggadah|Haggadah]]'', the text Jews recite at the start of the feast of [[wikt:Passover Seder|Passover]], when they celebrate the events recounted in the [[wikt:Exodus|Book of Exodus ]].&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 132.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 110.&lt;/ref&gt; The words are taken from Exodus 13:3 and 13:14.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0213.htm#3 Exodus 13:3] and [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0213.htm#14 Exodus 13:14.]&lt;/ref&gt;


'''''alleluia'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''Praise God!''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 132.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 110.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the usual Latin form of the Hebrew command ''[[wikt:Hallelujah|Hallelu Yah]]'', or ''Hallelujah''. The word occurs several times in the ''[[wikt:Haggadah|Haggadah]]'', which Jews read during the celebration of [[wikt:Passover|Passover]].


'''''Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Hebrew'') ''Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 132.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 110.&lt;/ref&gt; These are the opening words of [[wikt:Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy 6:4]], the Hebrew prayer known as the ''Shema'' or ''[[wikt:Shema Yisrael|Shema Yisrael]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0506.htm#4 Deuteronomy 6:4.]&lt;/ref&gt; This Judaic confession of faith is recited twice a day, morning and evening, by orthodox Jews as part of their daily [[wikt:Jewish prayer|prayer services]]. The Hebrew word ''[[wikt:Names of God in Judaism|Adonai]]'' (''Lord'') is substituted for the Bible's ''YHWH'', which is never pronounced.


'''No, that's the other'''{{spaces|5}}Bloom correctly remembers that the ''Shema'' is not part of the Jewish Passover ritual.

'''''Pardon, monsieur'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''Excuse me, sir''. Lenehan is noted for his frequent use of French. Joyce's principal model for Lenehan was Michael Hart, a friend's of Joyce's father who died around 1900; Hart too had a habit of speaking French.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1982), p. 365&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Ithaca/657|657.20]], where Bloom recalls the death of Hart.


'''''anno Domini'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''in the year of our Lord''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Lenehan is using the phrase ''[[w:Anno Domini|Anno Domini]]'' in a Pickwickian sense, meaning ''years''.

'''mazurka'''{{spaces|5}}A [[wikt:mazurka|mazurka]] is a lively Polish country dance in triple time; the dancers mark the heavy accent on the third (or sometimes the second) beat of each bar by tapping their heels or stamping their feet. Joyce's use of the noun as a verb is analogous to the similar treatment of the names of other dances, e.g. ''[[wikt:waltz|waltz]]'', ''[[wikt:tango|tango]]''.

'''''Thanky vous'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') Lenehan whimsically turns ''Thank you'' into French by translating ''you'' (''[[wikt:vous|vous]]'') and replacing ''Thank'' with a French-sounding hypocorism. The phrase does also sound like the German equivalent, ''[[wikt:danke schön|Danke schön]]'', though Lenehan has no history of quoting German.

'''Cloacae'''{{spaces|5}}''Sewers''; ''drains''. The word is the plural of the Latin ''[[wikt:cloaca|cloaca]]''. In some versions of ''Ulysses'' the word is emended to the italicized ''Cloacae'' or the unitalicized &quot;Cloacæ&quot;, but the word has been adopted into English, with its Latin plural, so no emendation is required. When an earlier draft of this episode was published in ''[[w:The Little Rewiew|The Little Review]]'' in October 1918, the word ''was'' italicized: ''Cloacae''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.lib.brown.edu/repository2/repoman.php?verb=render&amp;id=1298921533562502&amp;view=pageturner&amp;pageno=39 ''The Little Review'', Volume 5, Number 6, Page 37.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''He saw them three by three ... underdarkneath the night'''{{spaces|5}}Following the allusion to Dante's ''Inferno'', Stephen now conflates two episodes from the remaining parts of the ''[[w:Divine Comedy|Divine Comedy]]'': the Divine Pageant (or Mystic Procession) in the 29th canto of the ''[[w:Purgatorio|Purgatorio]]'', and the vision of the [[w:Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] in the 31st canto of the ''[[w:Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 143.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

''la terza parea neve teste' mossa;''

''e or parean da la bianca tratte,''
''or da la rossa; e dal canto di questa''
''l'altre toglien l'andare e tarde e ratte.''

''Da la sinistra quattro facean festa,''
''in porpore vestite, dietro al modo''

'''He saw them three by three'''{{spaces|5}}[[w:Dante Alighieri|Dante]], who employed ''[[w:Terza rima|terza rima]]'' in his ''[[w:Divine Comedy|Divine Comedy]]''.


'''three by three'''{{spaces|5}}This phrase does not occur in the passages Stephen conflates. Gifford&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 143.&lt;/ref&gt; mistranslates ''Purgatorio'' 29:110 ''tre e tre'' as ''three by three'', believing it refers to the three approaching ladies, but ''tre e tre'' means ''three and three'', and refers to the first three and final three of the seven bands in the Divine Pageant: twenty-four elders, representing the books of the [[w:Old Testament|Old Testament]]; the four [[w:Living creatures (Bible)|Living Creatures of the Apocalypse]], representing the four [[w:Gospel|Gospels]]; the three ladies, representing the three [[w:Theological virtues|Theological Virtues]], Faith, Hope and Charity; four dancers, representing the four [[w:Cardinal virtues|Cardinal Virtues]], Prudence, Justice, Temperance and Fortitude; two old men, representing the ''[[w:Acts of the Apostles|Acts of the Apostles]]'' and the [[w:Pauline epistles|Epistles of Saint Paul]]; four humble men, representing the [[w:General epistles|Epistles of Saints Peter, James, John and Jude]]; and one old man, representing the ''[[w:Book of Revelation|Book of Revelation]]''. Stephen, however, is still thinking of the ''[[w:terza rima|terza rima]]'' Dante employs in his ''Comedy'', in which the rhymes occur three by three.


'''entwining'''{{spaces|5}}Stephen is thinking of the manner in which the rhymes are entwined in Dante's ''[[w:Terza rima|terza rima]]''.


'''''per l'aere perso'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''through the murky air''. In his ''[[w:Convivio|Convivio]]'', Dante defines ''perse'' as ''a colour mingled of purple and of black, but the black predominates''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.org/stream/convivioofdantea00dantiala#page/325/mode/1up Dante, ''Convivio'' 4:20.]&lt;/ref&gt; See the quotation from Dante's ''Inferno'' 5:89 above.


'''''quella pacifica oriafiamma'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''that peaceful Oriflamme''. See the quotation from [[w:Dante Alighieri|Dante's]] ''[[w:Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'' 31:127 above. The ''[[w:Oriflamme|Oriflamme]]'' was the battle standard of the kings of France.


'''''di rimirar fè più ardenti'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''made ''[''my eyes'']'' more eager to regaze''. See the quotation from [[w:Dante Alighieri|Dante's]] ''[[w:Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'' 31:142 above. These are the closing words of the canto.


'''But I old men'''{{spaces|5}}Dante saw his rhymes three by three as colourful girls, but Stephen sees the rhymes he employed in the quatrain he wrote in ''Proteus'' as pairs of old men. See [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Aeolus/127|127.20-23]].

The information presented is dense. There is not enough explanatory English text. 
One would need to know a lot about CA in advance in order to make sense of the page?

== Garden of Eden regular expression correct? ==

The shortest sequence I can generate with the garden of eden regular expression
0*1(00*1+1(1+00)*010)*1(1+00)*011(0+1)*
is 11011

11011 is not a garden of eden state as 1010011 is it's parent.

Also I cannot seem to generate 01010, which does appear to be a garden of eden state as stated, with the regular expression.

Perhaps I am reading the symbols wrong, I am interpreting them with the same meaning they have in POSIX regexes.
even if I interpret the plus symbol as a union, I can get 11011 and not 01010.  It just seems incorrect to me.

If no one can explain where this regex comes from someone should delete it.  Also a citation would be nice, then we could actually verify these things from an authoritative source.

For all I know that could be a regex of garden of eden states for a different rule that got placed here by mistake.</text>

Most of the material is classical mathematics. There are some diagrams at the bottom which are CA-related?
The page would NOT ENCOURAGE the inquisitive visitor... One really needs to emphasize the CA up front
rather than presenting the classical differential equations?

      <comment>/* Copyright violation */ Update figures and rules</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Copyright violation ==

Software copyright violation (&quot;Piracy&quot;), involves creating unlicensed duplicates of computer programs, then selling them or using them, even as authentic items. Software application programs that are used without the permission of the owner/manufacturer or obtained illegally are often called pirated software, the proper term would be unlicensed software. It is illegal in the United States and in most countries.

According to the [[w:Business Software Alliance|Business Software Alliance (BSA)]] 2009 report, approximately 41% of all personal computer software is installed illegally. The loss to software vendors is about $50 billion.

{{NOTE|This types of estimations are intrinsically prone to errors. First the source of the reports have an invested interest in amplifying the problem and the cause, toward the goal calling attention to the issue and doing so generate supportive legislation. Second, it implies that not only that the numbers are accurate but that all detected illegal uses directly signifies missed revenue. }}
[[File:Pro piracy demonstration.jpg|thumb|Demonstration against Copyright law]]
Copyright violation is often represented as theft, this is factually incorrect since nothing is directly subtracted from the owner. It is an infringement of the owner rights that can indeed cause monetary loss by depreciating how the public views the product, since copies may be of inferior quality or compromised (include virus) and reduce legitimate sales (this is however somewhat counter balanced by increased public exposition).

With the widespread violation of copyright, due to the intrusive types of protection schemes, bad legislation and unrealistic duration of copyright, owners and manufactures do not get direct and guaranteed return for their creative work. Programs that have high costs are industrially duplicated used illegally or pirated, this also means that states can not tax these sales.

After interviewing 15,000 computer users from 33 different countries in early 2012, the Business Software Alliance found 57% of the world computer users acknowledge to using pirated software. Most of the users of pirated software are young males in countries with developing economies, such as Venezuela, China and Thailand. 

With the expansion of global markets, it is essential that businesses audit their software to lower their risk for copyright violations. Sarbanes-Oxley requires company officers to confirm the integrity of all financial records and to ensure the proper internal controls are in place. Should a company be found guilty of copy right violations the penalties include $150,000 fine per violation and possible prison time for the officers of the company. 




=== Copyright law opposition ===
[[File:Anti-copyright.svg|100px|thumb|Anti-copy Symbol]]
One form of defense that right owners (firm or author) of software can use to deter criminals from unlicensed duplicating software is Copyright. This is protection available to the rights owner of a software program, a book, movie, etc. Having this protection gives the author exclusive right to duplicate it. A copyright, depending on local legislation, may last for 95 years of publication or 120 years since the date it was created, whichever comes first.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This template is used by a series of sub-templates of {{tl|Subjects}} with integer names, to determine the name of the next template in the series.
=== Usage ===
The single unnamed parameter, {{((}}{1}{{))}}, is the integer number of the current sub-template.  One is added to {{((}}{1}{{))}}; call the sum ''n''.  If ''n'' is an integer, and there exists a template {{nowrap|{{((}}Subjects/''n''{{))}}}}, the result returned is {{nowrap|&quot;''n''&quot;}}.  Otherwise, the result returned is {{nowrap|&quot;upper bound&quot;}}.
=== See also ===
* {{tl|Subjects/0}}
* {{tl|Subjects/upper bound}}
* {{tl|Subjects/leaf}}
&lt;includeonly&gt;
&lt;!-- CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS HERE, THANKS --&gt;

'''''table d'hôte'' she called it'''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''Table d'hôte'' is a fixed menu in a hotel, offering a fixed meal at a set price. The ''she'' Bloom refers to may be ''[[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Cyclops/293|Mrs O'Dowd that kept the hotel]]''.

'''Herring's blush'''{{spaces|5}}(''proverbial'') ''It would make a red herring blush'' is used proverbially to describe something very shameful. Bloom, however, is misusing the phrase to describe Davy Byrne's rosy cheeks.

==Annotations==
'''''élite'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''the upper class''; ''the rich''; ''the privileged members of society''. This French [[wikt:élite|term]] is now a naturalized English word. The literal translation is ''[[wikt:elect|elect]]''.


'''''Crème de la crème'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''the best of the best''. This French [[wikt:crème de la crème|expression]] is now a naturalized English phrase. The literal translation is ''cream of the cream'', the cream being the richest part of milk.


'''Whitehatted ''chef'' like a rabbi'''{{spaces|5}}On certain ceremonial occasions, rabbis wear white cylindrical hats similar to the traditional white cap of a French chef.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloom may be thinking of the ''[[w:Shtreimel|shtreimel]]'', which comes in several varieties, not all of them worn exclusively by rabbis. The ''shtreimel'' of Rabbi [[w:Menachem Mendel Schneersohn|Menachem Mendel Schneersohn]] was made of white velvet and was not unlike a [[w:Chef's uniform|chef's white hat]], or ''[[w:Toque|toque blanche]]''.


'''''chef'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''the head cook in a kitchen or establishment''. This French [[wikt:chef|term]] is now a naturalized English word and is not usually italicized. The literal translation is ''head''.


'''Curly cabbage ''à la duchesse de Parme'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''Curly kale cooked in a style popularized by the Duchess of Parma''. Gifford identifies this as ''Baked savoy cabbage with a stuffing of ground veal, herbs, bread crumbs, etc''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 182.&lt;/ref&gt; But ''curly cabbage'' is a literal translation of ''chou frisé'', the French name for [[w:Kale|curly kale]]. Auguste Morel, who worked on the authorized French translation of ''Ulysses'', translated Joyce's ''Curly cabbage'' as ''Chou frisé''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ulysse |last=Joyce |first=James |others=Auguste Morel, Stuart Gilbert (trans.) |year=1929 |publisher=La Maison des Amis des Livres |location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1816 the estranged wife of Napoleon Bonaparte [[w:Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie Louise]] became Duchess of Parma. She introduced the manners and ''cuisine'' of the French court to Italy, and her tastes made a lasting impression on local dishes.


'''''Du, de, la'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''Of the, of, the''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 182.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Du'' is a contraction of the preposition ''de'' (''of'' or ''from'') and the masculine [[w:Article (grammar)|definite article]] ''le'' (''the''). ''De la'' is the feminine equivalent of ''du''. Some editions of ''Ulysses'' omit the comma after ''de''. The Corrected Text omits all three commas from this sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Gabler (1984) 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Don Giovanni, a cenar teco M'invitasti'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''Don Giovanni, you invited me to dine with you''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 185.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 148.&lt;/ref&gt; These words are spoken by the statue of the Commendatore in the final scene of [[w:Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] opera ''[[w:Don Giovanni|Don Giovanni]]''. In the opening scene of the opera, Don Giovanni kills the Commendatore, who is trying to protect his daughter Donna Anna from the Don's attempted rape. In Act II, Scene 3, the Don comes across a statue of the Commendatore in a graveyard, and he mockingly invites it to dinner.


'''''A cenar teco'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''To dine with you''.


'''What does that ''teco'' mean?'''{{spaces|5}} (''Italian'') ''With you''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 185.&lt;/ref&gt;


'''''The rum the rumdum'''''{{spaces|5}} The Commendatore's next line is: ''E son venuto'' (''And I have come''), which has the same rhythm as Bloom's ''The rum the rumdum''.

'''''Orchestral Satan, weeping many a rood ... fatto trombetta'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') Stephen here conflates two lines from [[w:John Milton|Milton's]] ''[[w:Paradise Lost|Paradise Lost]]'' and one line from [[w:Dante Alighieri|Dante's]] ''[[w:Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 194.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The lines from Milton refer first to Satan's huge bulk as he lies prone in the burning lake of Hell and then to the tears he lets drop as he is about to address his fallen angels:

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|+ '''''Paradise Lost 1:196 ... 1:620'''''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/26/pg26.txt John Milton, ''Paradise Lost''.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
| &lt;poem&gt;''Lay floating many a rood...''
''Tears such as angels weep burst forth....''
&lt;/poem&gt;
|}

The line from Dante is the closing line of the twenty-first canto of the ''Inferno''. It refers not to Satan but to another infernal demon Barbaricca, one of the ''[[w:Malabranche (Divine Comedy)|Malabranche]]''. Barbaricca is the leader of a troop of demons who escort Dante and Virgil through the fifth of the ''[[w:Malebolge|Malebolge]]'' that comprise the Eighth Circle of Hell. His fellow demons salute him by sticking out their tongues and he responds by farting:

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|+ '''''Inferno 21:139'''''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1009/pg1009.txt Dante, ''Inferno''.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
| &lt;poem&gt;''ed elli avea del cul fatto trombetta.''
&lt;/poem&gt;
| &lt;poem&gt;''and he made a trumpet of his arse.''
&lt;/poem&gt;
|}

Stephen has modernized Dante's spelling of ''elli'' (''he'')


'''and one more to hail him : ''ave, rabbi'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''hail, master.''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 195.&lt;/ref&gt; The words, spoken by Judas just before he kisses and betrays Christ, are taken from the Latin [[w:Vulgate|Vulgate]] translation of Matthew 26:49.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2026&amp;version=KJV Matthew 26.]&lt;/ref&gt; Cranly is presumably being identified here by Joyce as Judas. Joyce and J. F. Byrne (the model for Cranly) became estranged in 1902, shortly before Joyce met [[w:Oliver St. John Gogarty|Oliver St. John Gogarty]] (the model for Buck Mulligan), though it was Byrne who felt that he had been betrayed by Joyce.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1983) 116-117.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Documentation subpage}}
&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

{{high-risk}}&lt;!-- this documentation is used for the entire series of templates subjects/n --&gt;
This is one of a series of sub-templates of {{tl|subjects}} that add the current page to [[Template:Allbooks category|allbooks categories]].
=== Usage ===
There are three required parameters and two optional.  One of the required parameters may be blank.
* {{((}}{ping}{{))}} &amp;mdash; Optional.  If non-blank, this template is only being called to make sure it exists.
* {{((}}{subject}{{))}} &amp;mdash; Required.  Names a subject to whose allbooks category this page should be added.
* {{((}}{origin}{{))}} &amp;mdash; Required.  Names the previously visited subject, ''if any'', which provided the value for {{((}}{subject}{{))}}; may be blank.
* {{((}}{n}{{))}} &amp;mdash; Required.  An integer that names this template.  The first template in the series is called 0, the second is 1, and so on.
* {{((}}{diagnose}{{))}} &amp;mdash; Optional.  If non-blank, diagnostic messages are provided when errors are detected, together with suggestions to fix the problem and buttons to act on the suggestions.
If {{((}}{ping}{{))}} is non-blank, this template simply returns &quot;ping&quot; without doing anything else.  This makes it possible for each template in the series to look for the [[Template:Subjects/name next|next]] template in the series without using expensive parser function {{((}}#ifexist:{{))}} (instead, simply ping the next template and compare the result to &quot;ping&quot;).

Otherwise, this template first requests the current page be added to the allbooks category associated with {{nowrap|Subject:{{((}}{subject}{{))}}}}, via {{tl|Subjects/allbooks}}.  Then it checks to see whether the subject page itself exists and is suitably formatted for extraction of its parent parameters.  If all is well, it extracts the parent parameters from the subject page, and passes each of them in turn to the next sub-template in the series.  Otherwise, it adds the current page to {{nowrap|[[:Category:Attention needed (allbooks)]]}}, and if in addition {{((}}{diagnose}{{))}} is non-blank, also calls {{nowrap|{{tl|subjects/diagnose subject}}}}.

When calling the next template in the series, the identity of the next template is determined via {{nowrap|{{tl|subjects/name next}}}}, which detects when there are no more templates available in the series and in that case diverts the call to {{nowrap|{{tl|subjects/upper bound}}}}.

== Learn Hawaiian Textbook for Dedicated Students ==

Hi, An anonymous IP user has requested the deletion of this book.  I am thinking that this was you and you hadn't logged in?  You were the only contributor to the book before the deletion was requested so if you wish to delete it there is no problem.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:54, 25 November 2011 (UTC)

== Hawaiian- For the Dedicated Learner ==

Hello there, Master tongue. I read your user page and I congratulate you on your quest to learn more than 58 languages. Very impressive! Your book, Hawaiian- For the Dedicated Learner, is wonderful so far! However, I do have a few issues to bring up with you regarding the book. First and foremost, wikibooks already has a book titled [[Hawaiian]], so I will be proposing a merge of your book into that one. I do not mean to offend you, but that book's title is more appropriate for the Wikibooks platform. However, I am very dedicated to preserving the content you have already created within your book, including your navigation plan, and I hope you do continue to make content for the [[Hawaiian]] wikibook. --[[User:Thereen|Thereen]] ([[User talk:Thereen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thereen|contribs]]) 05:51, 27 November 2011 (UTC)

You know what really bugs me? When you go from website to website, looking for a legit one where you can learn a language, but all the ones you can find are the same: they show you phrases that might/will come in handy if/when you travel to the place where that language is spoken.

Almost every site lacks the grammar behind the language unless one searches for &quot;Grammar&quot;. If you are not aware yet, let me inform you that there is so much more to language than just words. Grammar is a large part of it all, along with pronunciation and slang/common speach. So many websites think it's ok to just say, &quot;Ok, memorize these phrases and you'll be good,&quot; but it doesn't mean anything if you don't know '''how''' to use that information. That really gets on my nerves! Uhg! ([[User:Master tongue|Master tongue]] ([[User talk:Master tongue|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Master tongue|contribs]]) 04:50, 10 January 2012 (UTC))


==Important Note for Those Interested in Learning Irish...==
For those interested in learning Irish, I have found a fantastic website that is entirely self tought, allowing you to go at your own pace:

http://www.irishpage.com/irishpeople/index.htm

It really is a wonderful site, and I have been enjoying it. It shows pronunciation, and explains everything from the beginning, starting with easy, basic notes, to more advanced lessons. Did I mention that there are 128 lessons here?!? What's more, there is an internal link to a different page, in a different course with audio, yet one must pay to use that one. (I still recomend looking it over a bit though!)
And with that, I say, Good Luck! to everyone in their language studies! ([[User:Master tongue|Master tongue]] ([[User talk:Master tongue|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Master tongue|contribs]]) 23:48, 11 January 2012 (UTC))

== Hawaiian book ==

Master tongue, there are a few points of confusion I have over the content in your Hawaiian wikibook. Check out: [[Talk:Hawaiian/Lesson_One]]. [[Special:Contributions/75.36.227.38|75.36.227.38]] ([[User talk:75.36.227.38|discuss]]) 06:30, 5 August 2012 (UTC)</text>

==Introduction: The First Sustained Example of Men and Women Writing Together in the English Tradition==
===Overview===
Despite growing scholarly interest in the Devonshire Manuscript (BL MS Add. 17492), a verse miscellany belonging to the 1530s and early 1540s,&lt;ref&gt;Following Peter Beal’s definition of a verse miscellany as “a manuscript, a compilation of predominantly verse texts, or extracts from verse texts, by different authors and usually gleaned from different sources,” in ''A Dictionary of English Manuscript Terminology, 1450–2000'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), 429. Beal lists D as a pertinent example of a verse miscellany (430).&lt;/ref&gt; there have been no authoritative critical editions published to date.&lt;ref&gt;A modernized-spelling, ''The Devonshire Manuscript of Courtly Verse: A Woman’s Book,'' edited by Elizabeth Heale, is forthcoming in ''The Other Voices in Early Modern Europe'' series published by University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier scholarship privileged the Devonshire Manuscript (conventionally referred to as sigil D in most scholarly apparatus) in relation to the canon of Sir Thomas Wyatt, since 129 of the 185 items of verse (complete poems and fragments) contained in the miscellany have been attributed to him. These verses, in turn, have been transcribed and published by Agnes K. Foxwell, Kenneth Muir, and Patricia Thomson in their respective editions of Wyatt’s poetry.&lt;ref&gt;A. K. Foxwell, ed., ''The Poems of Sir Thomas Wiat'' (London: University of London Press, 1914), I: 251-355; Kenneth Muir, ed. ''Collected Poems of Sir Thomas Wyatt'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1949), 91-155; Kenneth Muir and Patricia Thomson, ed. ''Collected Poems of Sir Thomas Wyatt'' (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 1969), 189-236; hereafter referred to as sigla F, M, and M &amp; T respectively. Many of the remaining poems, unattributed to Wyatt, have been transcribed and published in Kenneth Muir, “Unpublished Poems in the Devonshire Manuscript,” ''Proceedings of the Leeds Philosophical Society'' 6.4 (1947): 253-82, hereafter referred to as sigil MU. George Frederick Nott’s important early two-volume edition, ''The Works of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, and of Sir Thomas Wyatt, the Elder'' (London: Longham, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown, 1815-16), hereafter sigil N, does not include diplomatic transcriptions of verses in D. The numerous errors in transcription made in these earlier publications are discussed in the Textual Introduction and are glossed in the critical apparatus.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Arthur F. Marotti has argued, the “author-centered focus” of these editions “distorts [the] character” of the Devonshire Manuscript in two ways: “First, it unjustifiably draws the work of other writers into the Wyatt canon, and, second, it prevents an appreciation of the collection as a document illustrating some of the uses of lyric verse within an actual social environment.”&lt;ref&gt;  Arthur F. Marotti, ''Manuscript, Print, and the English Renaissance Lyric'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1995), 40. Nott’s misguided statement, that the manuscript “contains Wyatt’s pieces almost exclusively” (N, II: vii), or Muir’s comment, “it is not always easy to decide whether a poem [in the manuscript] is written by a successful imitator or by Wyatt himself in an uninspired mood” (MU, 253) are characteristic of the sort of dismissive author-centric views taken to task by Marotti.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Devonshire Manuscript is much more than an important witness in the Wyatt canon; it is also, in the estimation of Colin Burrow, “the richest surviving record of early Tudor poetry and of the literary activities of 16th-century women.”&lt;ref&gt;Colin Burrow, “How to Twist a Knife,” ''London Review of Books'' 31.8 (2009): 3, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The present edition seeks to publish the contents of the manuscript in their entirety, to move beyond the limitations of an author-centered focus on Wyatt’s contributions in isolation, and to concentrate on the social, literary, and historical contexts in which the volume is situated as a unified whole. In doing so, we are mindful of Marotti’s assertion that “literary production, reproduction, and reception are all socially mediated, the resulting texts demanding attention in their own right and not just as legitimate or illegitimate variants from authorial archetypes.”&lt;ref&gt;Arthur F. Marotti, “Manuscript, Print, and the English Renaissance Lyric,” in ''New Ways of Looking at Old Texts: Papers of the Renaissance English Text Society, 1958–1991'', ed. W. Speed Hill (Binghamton: Center for Medieval and Early Renaissance Studies, 1993), 209-221, at 212.&lt;/ref&gt; A concomitant aim of the present edition, therefore, is to preserve the socially mediated textual and extra-textual elements of the manuscript that have been elided in previous transcriptions. These “paratexts”&lt;ref&gt;We have interpreted “paratext” broadly, as articulated in Gérard Genette, ''Paratext: The Thresholds of Textuality'', trans. Jane E. Lewin (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; make significant contributions to the meaning and appreciation of the manuscript miscellany and its constituent parts: annotations, glosses, names, ciphers, and various jottings; the telling proximity of one work and another; significant gatherings of materials; illustrations entered into the manuscript alongside the text; and so forth. To accomplish these goals, the present edition has been prepared as a diplomatic transcription of the Devonshire Manuscript with extensive scholarly apparatus.

===The Works of the Devonshire Manuscript===
Of its 194 items,&lt;ref&gt;Scholars have only cautiously asserted an approximate number of items preserved in D: “the number of poems in the manuscript can only be given as approximately 184” (Southall, &quot;Devonshire,&quot; 143); “the manuscript preserves about 185 items of verse, but it is impossible to obtain an exact figure as many of these are fragments, medieval extracts or the like, and others are divided up differently by various editors” (Remley, &quot;Mary Shelton,&quot; 47). &lt;/ref&gt; a figure that includes all creative textual works—complete poems, verse fragments and excerpts from longer works, anagrams, and other ephemeral jottings—the manuscript collection consists of short courtly verses by Sir Thomas Wyatt (129 items, 66 of which are unique to the manuscript) and Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey (1 item); verses attributed to Lady Margaret Douglas (2 items), Richard Hattfield (2 items), Mary Fitzroy (née Howard) (1 item), Lord Thomas Howard (3 items), Sir Edmund Knyvett (2 items), Sir Anthony Lee (1 item [“A. I.” has 3 items]), and Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley (1 item); transcribed portions of medieval verse by Geoffrey Chaucer (11 items), Thomas Hoccleve (3 items), and Richard Roos (2 items);&lt;ref&gt;The medieval origin of these texts was identified by Ethel Seaton, “ ‘The Devonshire Manuscript’ and Its Medieval Fragments,” ''RES'', n.s., 7 (1956): 55-56. The use of William Thynne’s 1532 edition of Chaucer as the source for that poet’s verse in D was first noted by Richard Harrier, “A Printed Source for ‘The Devonshire Manuscript,’” ''RES'', n.s., 11 (1960): 54.&lt;/ref&gt; transcriptions of the work of others or original works by prominent court figures such as Mary Shelton, Lady Margaret Douglas, Mary (Howard) Fitzroy, Lord Thomas Howard, and, perhaps, Queen Anne Boleyn;&lt;ref&gt;As suggested in Southall, “Devonshire Manuscript,” 143. See the [[The_Devonshire_Manuscript/Biographies#Anne_Boleyn|biographical entry]] on Anne Boleyn for a more detailed discussion of her involvement with the manuscript.&lt;/ref&gt; and some 30 unidentified or unattributed pieces.&lt;ref&gt;The most recent examination of the hands in D is that of Helen Baron, “Mary (Howard) Fitzroy’s Hand,” esp. Table 1. See also the earlier findings of Edward A. Bond, “Wyatt’s Poems,” ''The Athenaeum'' 2274 (1874): 654-55. The present edition follows Baron’s findings, confirmed by independent investigation, as outlined in the Textual Introduction. See [[The_Devonshire_Manuscript/Biographies|Contributors to the Devonshire Manuscript]] for brief biographies of each of the identified hands and authors.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Marotti has noted, courtly manuscript miscellanies and poetic anthologies “represent the meeting ground of literary production and social practices,”&lt;ref&gt;Marotti, “Manuscript, Print, and the English Renaissance Lyric,” 212.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Devonshire Manuscript contains a number of pertinent examples, most notably in the form of epistolary verse and scribal annotation. The most widely documented instance is the sequence of epistolary love-poetry exchanged between Lady Margaret Douglas and Lord Thomas Howard, presumably composed while the couple was incarcerated for their clandestine betrothal.&lt;ref&gt;The relevance of the Howard-Douglas affair to this sequence in D was first noted by Bond, “Wyatt’s Poems,” 654-55. &lt;/ref&gt; The exchange takes place over a series of poems (ff. [26r]–[29v]), assumed to be in sequence, and all entered by the same hand (TH2).&lt;ref&gt;It is unclear whether the hand belongs to Lord Thomas Howard, since no independent examples of his hand have survived. Bond argued that Lord Thomas entered the series of poems into the volume during his imprisonment in the Tower (655). The alternative theory, that the epistolary verses were collected and entered into D as a group later, is proposed and dismissed by Baron (327). &lt;/ref&gt; The first verse begins with Lord Thomas lamenting “Alas that euer prison stronge / sholde such too louers seperate” (f. [26r], ll. 5-6). The poem immediately following, thought to be Lady Margaret’s reply,&lt;ref&gt;Scholars have traditionally followed Bond’s earlier assertion that the name “margrt” is scrawled at the end of the poem (f. [26v]), perhaps attributing authorship: Baron, 332; Harrier, Canon, 25; and Elizabeth Heale, ''Wyatt, Surrey and Early Tudor Poetry'' (London: Longman, 1998), 42. Independent examination of the manuscript suggests that the “scrawl” is only partially legible, with only the letter forms “ma”, “r”, and “h” clearly identifiable. As such, it may refer either to Mar[y] H[oward] or to Mar[garet] H[oward], the latter symbolically adopting her husband’s surname following their betrothal. An entry found on the flyleaf (f. [1r]) is similarly unclear: in faint ink, “margeret how” is possibly inscribed (Baron, 331; Bond, “Wyatt’s Poems,” 655); however, Remley has argued that the “hurried and surreptitious mark” was in fact made by Mary Shelton, reading it as “Mary Sh—lt—” (“Mary Shelton,” 54).&lt;/ref&gt; also makes reference to the lovers’ imprisonment and separation: “the one off us from the other they do absent” (f. [26v], l. 9). Lord Thomas then promises his “worldly tresor” that “My loue truly shall not decay / for thretnyng nor for punysment” (f. [27r], ll. 15-16). The form of this “punysment” is captivity, which Lord Thomas likens to that of “a hawke” in a “mue” (f. [27r], l. 27). A hawk is kept in a mew or moulting-cage (OED, “mew, n.2” 3.a) while it sheds its feathers. The image is optimistic, as it suggests that the lovers’ imprisonment and vulnerability is only temporary, and is a time of transformation and renewal: the sixteenth-century encyclopedia Batman vppon Bartholome held that hawks were mewed “that they may be discharged of olde fethers and hard, and be so renewed in fairnesse of youth.”&lt;ref&gt;''Batman vppon Bartholome, his booke De Proprietatibus rerum, newly corrected, enlarged, and ammended'', compiled by Steven Batman and translated by John Trevisa (London, 1582), f. 178r. Edward Phillips notes in his dictionary, ''The New World of English Words'' (London, 1658), “A Mue for Hawks” is “a kind of cage or aviary where Hawks are kept when they change their feathers” and “comes from the French word Muer, to change” (f. 2C4v).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following poem, Lord Thomas identifies his secret betrothal to Lady Margaret as the source of the couple’s current woes—“alas me thynke the[y] do me wronge / That they wold haue me to resyne / my tytly tytle wych ys good and stronge / that I am yowrs and yow ar myne” (f. [27v], ll. 9-12)—and that this punishment is designed to compel him to “swere / your company for to forsake” (f. [27v], ll. 13-14). As the next verse makes clear, the faithful lover remains steadfast in his devotion: “The[y] wyll me hyr for to deny / whom I wyll loue moste hartely / vntyll I dye” (f. [28r], ll. 9-12). The poem immediately following, presumably composed by Lady Margaret, is written as a response to the “great paynes he [Lord Thomas] suffereth for my sake / contynnually both nyght and day” (f. [28v], ll. 5-6), promising to reward his sufferings with eternal love in terms that poetically echo his earlier sentiments: “from me hys loue wyll not decay” (f. [28v], l. 8). 

As the sequence progresses, the hopeful tone of the earlier verses—the protestations of unerring commitment and unwavering love, the casting of the lovers’ imprisonment as temporary and a time of renewal—is gradually overtaken by more pessimistic sentiments. The gift of love exchanged between the lovers is no longer described as eternal, but “for terme off lyfe” (f. [29r], l. 22). Explicit allusions to death and despair become more frequent. Consider the closing lines of the final poem in the sequence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;but whan ye comen by my sepulture&lt;br /&gt;
remembre that yowr felowe resteth there&lt;br /&gt;
for I louyd eke thowgh I vnworthy were&lt;ref&gt;f. [30r], ll. 5-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Remley has suggested that this pastiche of lines from Chaucer’s Troilus and Criseyde “recast[s] an excerpt from the lament of Troilus on the impending departure of Criseyde” and is “meant to serve as Howard’s epitaph.”&lt;ref&gt;Remley, “Mary Shelton,” 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Other images are more ambiguous in the final poems of the sequence. For instance, those who interfere (“bate or stryfe”) with the lovers’ marriage (“ower louyng bandys”) are wished to be on “goodwyn sandys” (f. [29r], ll. 25-27), a large sand shoal off the coast of Kent, famous as a site of shipwrecks. To “set up shop on Goodwin Sands” was proverbial for hopeless endeavor and running aground.&lt;ref&gt;See Morris Palmer Tilley, ''A Dictionary of the Proverbs in England in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1950), S393; and, W. G. Smith and F. P. Wilson, ''Oxford Dictionary of English Proverbs'', 3rd ed. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1970), S393. John Heywood’s ''Prouerbes'' (London, 1549) is usually cited as the earliest usage in print.&lt;/ref&gt; The allusion is clearly designed to express Lord Thomas’ desire to thwart efforts to hinder his relationship, but there is a cruel irony in the desperation of the proverb since it may be read as a projection of his own hopelessness. 

While an association between these poems and Margaret Douglas and Thomas Howard can be inferred on the basis of “the insertion of names and initials and the close fit of the biographical detail,”&lt;ref&gt;Heale, “Women and the Courtly Love Lyric,” 305.&lt;/ref&gt; to interpret these poems as actual love letters or as evidence of sincere feeling is, as Catherine Bates has argued, “to assume the position of the state interrogator who could claim, on the basis of such actions or words, to understand exactly what they signified” and to know “the contents of the heart.”&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Bates, “Wyatt, Surrey, and the Henrician Court,” in E''arly Modern English Poetry: A Critical Companion'', ed. Patrick Cheney, Andrew Hadfield, and Garrett Sullivan, Jr. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007), 39-47, at 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Bates asks, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Is it not preferable in literary historical terms, and closer to the spirit of Renaissance Court practice, to suspend judgment, to delay pronouncing the fatal “meaning,” and to sustain the play of enigmatic signification, since to do this leaves open the whole range of possibilities that such play-acting allows for: namely, that Thomas Howard and Margaret Douglas dramatized themselves as tragic lovers (or were so dramatized by their friends) either because such role-play did indeed correspond to their inner feelings, or because it allowed them to dissemble feelings that were quite different, or because the whole thing was a joke or game in which no feelings were involved at all, or because it provided an idealized model for feelings to which they aspired?&lt;ref&gt; Bates, “Wyatt, Surrey, and the Henrician Court,” 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition to the composition of epistolary verse, contributors to the manuscript interacted with one another through scribal annotation. These marginal responses are, at times, quite personal in nature. For example, the text of the poem “Suffryng in sorow in hope to attayn” (f. [6v–7r]) is annotated in the left margin: a hand identified as Lady Margaret Douglas’ writes “fforget thys,” to which a hand identified as Mary Shelton’s responds, “yt ys wor[t]hy” (f. [6v]). The poem is written in a male voice appealing for the love of a lady: “suffryng in sorow” and “desyryng in fere,” the poet pleads for his unnamed addressee to “ease me off my payn” (f. [6v], ll. 1-2, 4). While its authorship remains hotly debated,&lt;ref&gt;The poem is entered in D by an unidentified hand (H2), and is also preserved in the Blage Manuscript (Trinity College, Dublin, MS 160, f. 159r). Modern editors of Wyatt’s poems commonly attribute the poem to him (F, I: 257-58; M, 96-97; M &amp; T, 176-77; N, II: 590; R, 268-69). However, this attribution has not been universally accepted: Harrier argues that the poem “must be excluded from the Wyatt canon” since it “may be by Thomas Clere” (Canon, 41, 45), and Joost Daalder silently excludes the poem from his edition of the ''Collected Poems'' (London: Oxford University Press, 1975). Julia Boffey has argued the author is Mary Shelton, mistaking Shelton’s signed comment at the end of the poem as an attribution: “Women Authors and Women’s Literacy in Fourteenth- and Fifteenth-Century England,” in ''Women and Literature in Britain, 1150–1500'', ed. Carol M. Meale, 2nd ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), 159-82, at 173. See also the discussion in H. A. Mason, ''Editing Wyatt'' (Cambridge: Cambridge Quarterly, 1972), 126.&lt;/ref&gt; the acrostic of the verse suggests that Mary Shelton is the intended recipient: the first letter of its seven stanzas spells out “SHELTVN.” The scribal annotations, which may only to refer to the quality of the verse, might therefore take on a more profound and personal meaning: Lady Margaret recommends rejecting the poem and its suit (“fforget thys”), but this advice is contradicted by Shelton who finds “yt ys wor[t]hy.” At the end of the poem, Mary Shelton adds a comment that has been variously transcribed as “ondesyard sarwes / reqwer no hyar,”&lt;ref&gt;As per Baron, 331; Remley gives “ondesyerd” in “Mary Shelton,” 50.&lt;/ref&gt; “ondesyrid favours / deserv no hyer,”&lt;ref&gt;As per F, I: 258.&lt;/ref&gt; or perhaps “ondesyard fansies / requier no hyar.” &lt;ref&gt;As per Heale, “Women and the Courtly Love Lyric,” 301. Heale gives “ondesiard fansies / requier no hiar” in Wyatt, 43; and “ondesyred fansies / require no hyar” in “ ‘Desiring Women Writing’: Female Voices and Courtly ‘Balets’ in Some Early Tudor Manuscript Albums,” in ''Early Modern Women’s Manuscript Writing: Selected Papers from the Trinity/Trent Colloquium'', ed. Victoria E. Burke and Jonathan Gibson (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2004), 9-31, at 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The transcription poses an interesting editorial crux: “sarwes” might be read as “service” or “sorrows.”&lt;ref&gt;“Searwes” (device) is also possible, but unlikely. Alternatively rendering the word as “fansies” or “favours” is less problematic, but equally less probable.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, “hyar” may be read as “hire” or “ear.” As S. P. Zitner has argued, “Whether Mary Shelton was saying that undesired service (attention) required no hire or that undesired sorrows required no ear, the response is pretty much the same in tone and substance.”&lt;ref&gt;S. P. Zitner,  “Truth and Mourning in a Sonnet by Surrey,” ''ELH'' 50.3 (1983): 509-26, at 513.&lt;/ref&gt; While this comment may be a “remarkable example of an overtly critical rejoinder to a courtly lyric” written in the spirit described by Zitner, Remley has argued that “it seems equally probable that her words are meant ironically,” that they offer a “private recognition of the absurd spectacle of a man determined to get his way through protestations of extreme humility.”&lt;ref&gt;Remley, “Mary Shelton,” 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Elizabeth Heale has argued such “unsympathetic replies may be part of the conventional exchange of courtly verse” and might be offered in jest, as “such jesting offered some opportunities for female subject positions that seem to have appealed to the women using the manuscript.”&lt;ref&gt;Heale, “ ‘Women Desiring Writing,’” 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the precise intentions behind Mary Shelton’s annotations and commentary remain obscure, their potential importance to the meaning and interpretation of the verse cannot be disputed. 

Another example of this kind of social interaction is found in the scribal annotations attached to the text of a short verse, “The pleasaunt beat of swet Delyte” (f. [66r]). The poem, entered by an ornate and unidentified hand (H13), closes with the lines “whereas wysdome the soft Iudge doth Raign / prove wyt avoyedes all Daunger breding pain” (ll. 5-6). Over the word “Daunger,” a hand identified as Lady Margaret’s has written “doutt” or “doute.” As with the previous example, the intentions behind the annotation are unclear: if it is meant as a correction, why has the word “Daunger” not been struck out? An alternative explanation might be that the intention is to draw attention to the word “Daunger” by leaving it visible and labeling its appropriateness or sentiment as doubtful. 

The instances of scribal annotation and exchanges of epistolary verse detailed above are but representative samples of the kinds of social interaction found throughout the Devonshire Manuscript. In addition to examining the volume as “a medium of social intercourse,”  other aspects of the Devonshire Manuscript—its multi-layered and multi-authored composition, its early history and transmission, the ways in which its contents engage with and comment directly on contemporary political and social issues—invite further investigation.

===Public and Private, Personal and Communal===
In 1641, Richard Brathwaite considered the relative absence of literary works by women in the following terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;These [women writers] desired to doe well, and not to be applauded; to advance vertues, and not to have their names recorded: nor their amiable features with glorious Frontispices impaled. To improve goodnesse by humility, was their highest pitch of glory. This their sundry excellent fancies confirmed; their elegant labours discovered; whereof though many have suffered Oblivion through the injury of time, and want of that incomparable helpe of the Presse, the benefit whereof wee enjoy.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Love and Arthur F. Marotti, “Manuscript Transmission and Circulation,” in ''The Cambridge History of Early Modern English Literature'', ed. David Loewenstein and Janel Mueller (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), 55-80, at 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Brathwaite, the paucity of available literary works by women was the result of a number of social and cultural constraints. In contrast to the &quot;masculine&quot; pursuit of literary fame, women were encouraged to practice the &quot;feminine&quot; virtues of modesty and humility. Moreover, access to technologies of writing and publication was strictly regulated in gendered terms—as Jennifer Summit has argued, “while the printing press [brought] men’s works to public attention, it [denied] the same service to women, consigning them instead to the textual obscurity and fragility of the manuscript.”&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Summit, ''Lost Property: The Woman Writer and English Literary History, 1380–1589'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000), 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Although Brathwaite’s comments were published almost a century after the compilation of the Devonshire Manuscript, they do highlight a number of pertinent issues for further consideration: the question of text and authorship, the status of women in the production and circulation of literary works, and the material conditions of manuscript and print in early modern England. Recent scholarship has radically challenged the traditionally held notions of what constitutes a &quot;text&quot; and an &quot;author.&quot; The editorial theories championed by D. F. McKenzie and Jerome McGann expanded the notion of textual production beyond a simple consideration of authorial intention. For McGann, these “nonauthorial textual determinants”&lt;ref&gt;Jerome McGann, &quot;The Monks and the Giants: Textual and Bibliographical Studies and the Interpretation of Literary Works,” in ''Textual Criticism and Literary Interpretation'', ed. Jerome McGann (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1985) 180-99, at 198.&lt;/ref&gt; should be considered alongside authorial intention to include in our critical gaze “other persons or groups involved in the initial process of production,” the “phases or stages in the initial production process,” and the “materials, means, and modes in the initial productive process.”&lt;ref&gt;  Jerome McGann, ''The Beauty of Inflections: Literary Investigations in Historical Method and Theory'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988), 79, 82. See also his earlier study, ''A Critique of Modern Textual Criticism'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt; The program advocated by McKenzie as “the sociology of texts” further extended this concept of textual production by arguing for the significance of the material form of a text and its ability to affect the text’s meaning.&lt;ref&gt;D. F. McKenzie, ''Bibliography and the Sociology of Texts'' (London: British Library, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

These theories of textual production spurred critics to reevaluate the notion of authorship in order to account for nonauthorial (but nevertheless significant) contributors and collaborators to any given text. It became readily apparent that the modern notion of authorship, with its sense of ownership of and singular control, was anachronistic and particularly unhelpful when dealing with literature of earlier periods. Leah S. Marcus, for example, advocated a process of “unediting, ” a systematic exposition of the various layers of editorial mediation of any given Renaissance text.&lt;ref&gt;Leah S. Marcus, ''Unediting the Renaissance: Shakespeare, Marlowe, Milton'' (New York: Routledge, 1996). On “unediting” as the rejection of critical editions in preference to the unmediated study of originals or facsimiles, see Randall McLeod, “UnEditing Shakespeare,” ''Sub-Stance'' 33-34 (1982): 26-55.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have also explored the notion of collaborative authorship, especially in relation to Renaissance drama, since the authority of any given play is dispersed amongst an infinite number of collaborations—between author(s) and actor(s), text(s) and performance(s)—and agents involved in processes of mediation, such as revision, adaptation, publication, and preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Representative studies include: Margreta de Grazia and Peter Stallybrass, “The Materiality of the Shakespearean Text,” ''Shakespeare Quarterly'' 44 (1993): 255-83; David Scott Kastan, “Shakespeare after Theory,” ''Textus'' 9.2 (1996): 357-74, and ''Shakespeare and the Book'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001); Sonia Massai, ''Shakespeare and the Rise of the Editor'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007); Jeffrey Masten, ''Textual Intercourse: Collaboration, Authorship, and Sexualities in Renaissance Drama'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), and “More or Less: Editing the Collaborative,” ''Shakespeare Studies'' 29 (2001): 109-31; Stephen Orgel, “What is a Text?” ''Research Opportunities in Renaissance Drama'' 24 (1984): 3-6, and “Acting Scripts, Performing Texts,” in ''Crisis in Editing: Texts of the English Renaissance'', ed.

At the same time, the work of feminist literary critics and historians to rediscover texts by women and revise the canon of Western literature has also exposed the role of gender in the material and institutional conditions of textual production.&lt;ref&gt;Representative studies include Elaine V.

On women as readers, see Heidi Brayman Hackel, ''Reading Material in Early Modern England: Print, Gender, and Literacy'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; To effectively investigate the role of women in the production and circulation of literary works, Margaret J. M. Ezell, has persuasively proposed that the definition of “authorship” needs to be reexamined and broadened:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We need to think about not only women who wrote and published and got paid for doing so, but also about women who wrote and circulated text socially, women who compiled volumes and managed the preservation and transmission of texts by themselves and by others, women who patronized and supported other writers through their writings, and even those early modern women who owned books and who interwove their own writing into others’ texts.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret J. M. Ezell, “Women and Writing,” in ''A Companion to Early Modern Women’s Writing'', ed. Anita Pacheco (Malden: Blackwell, 2002), 77-94, at 79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

“Compilation,” Elizabeth Clarke has noted, “rather than authorship of the writing in a document,” was the “dominant literary activity among women who could read and write” in the early modern period.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Clarke, “Women’s Manuscript Miscellanies in Early Modern England,” in ''Teaching Tudor and Stuart Women Writers'', ed. Susanne Woods and Margaret P. Hannay (New York: MLA, 2000), 52-60, at 53.&lt;/ref&gt; This is certainly true in the case of the Devonshire Manuscript, where women were, for the most part, directly responsible for the compilation of the predominantly male-authored contents of the anthology.&lt;ref&gt;That is, out of the manuscript’s 194 textual items, 129 are verses attributed to Thomas Wyatt.&lt;/ref&gt; Compilation, like any of the other “nonauthorial” textual determinants described above, is an act of mediation: the selection of verses to be recorded, the manner in which they were entered, and their relative position to one another, all contribute to the meaning of the texts, both individually and as a collection. Verses entered into the manuscript may have been selected on the basis of their popularity at court—which might well account for the disproportionate number of Wyatt poems represented—or for more personal reasons; other verses, as recent scholarship has drawn attention to, were not simply selected and copied, but adapted and altered to suit specific needs. 

A pertinent example comes from a series of Middle English verse fragments copied into the Devonshire Manuscript on ff. [89v–92r], fragments extracted from Chaucer’s ''Troilus and Criseyde'' and other works attributed to Hoccleve and Roos, all of which were ultimately derived from Thynne’s 1532 edition of Chaucer’s ''Workes''.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Chaucer, ''The Workes of Geffray Chaucer'', ed. William Thynne (London, 1532).&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of the Chaucer excerpts prompted John E. Stevens to suggest that these verses were intended for performance at court;&lt;ref&gt;John E. Stevens, ''Music and Poetry in the Early Tudor Court'' (London: Methuen, 1961), 188.&lt;/ref&gt; however, critics have more recently argued that the fragments are more than simply “remnants of some kind of courtly game or amusement.”&lt;ref&gt;Remley, “Mary Shelton,” 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Heale has noted that “many of these stanzas utter with an unusual forcefulness a woman’s view of the dangers and doubleness of male rhetoric,” and may “have been chosen because they give, in forthright fashion, a view of women’s reputations and emotions as vulnerable and easily abused in matters of love.”&lt;ref&gt;Heale, “Women and the Courtly Love Lyric,” 306-7.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one of the fragments entered into the manuscript is from Thomas Hoccleve’s ''Letter of Cupid'', his Chaucerian-verse rendering of Christine de Pisan’s original French, which pointedly illustrates “the ease with which the pity and kindness [a] woman may show in response to pleading […] can be turned to her shame”:&lt;ref&gt;Heale, “Women and the Courtly Love Lyric,” 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;ys thys afayre avaunte / ys thys honor &lt;br/&gt;
a man hymselfe accuse thus and diffame&lt;br/&gt;
ys yt good to confesse hymself a traytour&lt;br/&gt;
and bryng a woman to sclaundrous name&lt;br/&gt;
and tell how he her body hath don shame&lt;br/&gt;
no worshyppe may he thus to hym conquer&lt;br/&gt;
but great dysclaunder vnto hym and her&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
To her nay / yet was yt no reprefe&lt;br /&gt;

and vnto her thanke perpatuel&lt;br /&gt;
that in suche a nede helpe can so well&lt;br /&gt;
							(f. [89v])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the next leaf, an excerpt from the Chaucerian poem ''Remedy of Love'' has been altered to cast women in a more positive light. Where the original has the misogynistic “the cursydnesss yet and disceyte of women” (f. 336v), the Devonshire Manuscript has “the faythfulnes yet and prayse of women,” rendering the complete stanza as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;yff all the erthe were parchment scrybable&lt;br /&gt;
spedy for the hande / and all maner wode&lt;br /&gt;
were hewed and proporcyoned to pennes able&lt;br /&gt;

the faythfulnes yet and prayse of women&lt;br /&gt;
cowde not be shewyd by the meane off penne&lt;br /&gt;
								(f. [90r])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Paul Remley has argued that the selection and careful alteration of these medieval fragments in the Devonshire Manuscript allowed their copyist (whom he asserts is Mary Shelton) to “find a voice for her indignation at the treatment of women of her time by hypocritical lovers,” and that the presence of such alterations suggests that the entries “should not be dismissed as mechanical exercises in transcription punctuated by a few haphazard scrawls,” but rather understood as “a deliberate attempt to recast poetry written by others as a new and proprietary sort of literary text.”&lt;ref&gt;Remley, “Mary Shelton,” 56, 42. While Remley argues that Mary Shelton is the copyist of these medieval fragments, the present edition instead concurs with Baron’s findings that the verses were entered by hand TH2, not MS. See the Textual Introduction for a discussion of these and other discrepancies.&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Heale, however, has suggested that while “it would be nice to be able to claim that these stanzas were copied by a woman,” that “it is entirely possible that they were noted and copied out by Lord Thomas Howard or by another man,” possibly “to amuse and please their female acquaintances, or as a source for poems of their own.” Moreover, Heale argues that the question is better reframed, that “in a system of manuscript copying, appropriation, and adaptation, the question is perhaps less of the name or gender of an originating author,” and more one “of the kinds of voices and gestures the available discourses make possible to copiers and readers of both sexes.”&lt;ref&gt;Heale, “Women and the Courtly Love Lyric,” 307.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to the selection and alteration of verses as outlined above, the proximity of one poem to another is often significant. The epistolary love-poetry exchanged between Lady Margaret Douglas and Lord Thomas Howard, collected and entered as a sequence in the manuscript, has already been discussed in some detail above. Another example of the potential importance of physical proximity between entries in the manuscript is the poem “My ferefull hope from me ys fledd” (f. [7v]), signed “fynys quod n[o]b[od]y,” which is answered by the poem immediately following on the facing leaf, “Yowre ferefull hope cannot prevayle” (f. [8r]), which is in turn signed “fynys quod s[omebody].” While this kind of playful imitation and formal echoing does not rely on the relative proximity of the poems in the manuscript, the effect is immediately apparent and more visually striking when the poems are placed, as they are, on facing leaves. 

The teasing blend of jest and earnestness in this pair of poems—whose authorship remains unattributed—points to the role of much of the content in the manuscript as participating in the courtly “game of love.”&lt;ref&gt;The standard discussion of the “game of love” is Stevens, ''Music and Poetry'', 154-202. See also Roger Boase, ''The Origin and Meaning of Courtly Love: A Critical Study of European Scholarship'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1977); David Burnley, ''Courtliness and Literature in Medieval England'' (New York: Longman, 1998); and, Bernard O’Donoghue, ''The Courtly Love Tradition'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; The Devonshire Manuscript was composed entirely by figures associated with the Tudor court, an environment where, as Lawrence Stone has argued, “well-born young persons of both sexes were thrown together away from parental supervision in a situation of considerable freedom as they performed their duties as courtiers, ladies and gentlemen in waiting, tutors and governesses to the children.” Moreover, these aristocratic youths “had a great deal of leisure, and in the enclosed hot-house atmosphere of these great houses, love intrigues flourished as nowhere else.”&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Stone, ''The Family, Sex and Marriage in England, 1500–1800'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1977), 103-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than “a monolithic set of regulations for love affairs” and “a code of behavior solemnly and universally observed,” the &quot;game of love&quot; is a modern term to describe the diverse range of “courtly styles, idioms, and conventions” available “to be read in a range of literal, playful, and ironic ways, depending on the context.”&lt;ref&gt;Introduction, ''Troilus and Criseyde'', ed. Barry A. Windeatt (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998), xxiii, n. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Since it facilitated the expression of love in a formal and refined manner, poetry, in particular the lyric form, was the field on which much of the courtly &quot;game of love&quot; was played:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Poetry ''mattered'' to the Courtier . . . . Poetry was an instrument of social converse and entertainment, sometimes in the form of a masque, sometimes the subject of an informal parlour game or competition of wit. Poetry could be used as a compliment or comment on virtually every happening in life, from birth to death, from the presentation of a gift to the launching of a war; it was the agent of flattery, ego titillation, love-making, condolence. Poetry was the medium of the communication of experience, the means for the resolution of personal syntheses and the expression of personal analyses.&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Saunders, “From Manuscript to Print: A Note on the Circulation of Poetic MSS in the Sixteenth Century,” ''Proceedings of the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society'' 6.8 (1951): 507-28, at 509 (emphasis original).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Julia Boffey has suggested, as the Devonshire Manuscript was “passed around” among the “men and women whose amorous relationships in ‘real life’ are partially documented,” that “it is hardly surprising that they chose for the most part to copy into it lyrics on the subject of love.”&lt;ref&gt;Julia Boffey, ''Manuscripts of English Courtly Love Lyrics in the Later Middle Ages'' (Woodbridge: D. S. Brewer, 1985), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; For those aristocratic youths so inclined, collecting courtly lyrics was “a literary and social parlour game with strong erotic undertones,” since the compilation and circulation of verse miscellanies such as the Devonshire Manuscript, “just like the autograph book circulated in Jane Austen’s ''Emma'',” could be “used as tools of courtship.”&lt;ref&gt;Janine Rogers, “Riddling Erotic Identity in Early English Lyrics,” in ''And Never Know the Joy: Sex and the Erotic in English Poetry'', ed. C. C. Barfoot (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2006), 1-12, at 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Verse writing, then, was “accounted a central grace of courting,” but women participating in the ‘game of love’ faced social restraints that placed them in a potentially awkward situation. On the one hand, direct engagement in such “courtly repartee” could be perceived as a violation of Christian moral codes in which “a woman’s chastity was closely aligned with her silence and self-effacement.”&lt;ref&gt;Heale, ''Wyatt, Surrey, and Early Tudor Poetry'', 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, as Ann Rosalind Jones has observed, the prescribed social role of women at court required each “to be a member of the chorus prompting men to bravery in tournaments and eloquence in conversation . . . to be a witty and informed participant in dialogues whose subject was most often love.”&lt;ref&gt;Ann Rosalind Jones, “Nets and Bridles: Early Modern Conduct Books and Sixteenth-Century Women’s Lyrics,” in ''The Ideology of Conduct: Essays on Literature and the History of Sexuality'', ed. Nancy Armstrong and Leonard Tennenhouse (London: Methuen, 1987), 39-72, at 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Courtly women were not only expected to actively participate, but also, as Catherine Bates has argued, to perform the role of arbiter: in the &quot;game of love,&quot; where “a whole field of action becomes a tableau of encrypted signs to be read . . . the point of the game is to keep everyone guessing, and . . . the question of whether and what things mean is ultimately in the arbitration of the woman.”&lt;ref&gt;Bates, “Wyatt, Surrey, and the Henrician Court,” 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary conduct manuals recognized the precarious position in which such disparate social expectations placed courtly women. In Baldassarre Castiglione’s The Courtier, a manual contrived to “shape in woordes a good Courtyer,” women are advised to achieve a balance within the prescribed limits:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Accompanying with sober and quiet maners and with the honestye that must alwayes be a stay to all her deedes, a readie liuelines of wit, wherby she may declare herselfe far wide from all dulnesse: but with such a kinde of goodnes, that she may be esteamed no lesse chaste, wise and courteise, then pleasant, feat conceited &amp; sobre: &amp; therfore must she kepe a certein meane very hard, &amp; (in a maner) diriued of contrarie matters, and come iust to certein limites, but not passe them.&lt;ref&gt;Baldassarre Castiglione, ''The Courtyer of Count Baldessar Castilio'', trans. Thomas Hoby (London, 1561), sigs. C1r, 2B3v.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The desire on the part of courtly women to maintain this “certein meane” whilst treading the “dangerous tightrope . . . between wit and scandal,”&lt;ref&gt;Heale, ''Wyatt, Surrey, and Early Tudor Poetry'', 41.&lt;/ref&gt; coupled with the “relative privacy of manuscript transmission and the relative hostility of print culture to women’s writing,” surely “affected women’s choice of the manuscript medium of communication.”&lt;ref&gt;Marotti, ''Manuscript, Print, and the English Renaissance Lyric'', 61.&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid what J. W. Saunders influentially termed “the stigma of print,”&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Saunders, “The Stigma of Print: A Note on the Social Bases of Tudor Poetry,” ''Essays in Criticism'' 1.2 (1951): 139-64. For an important challenge to Saunders’ view, see Steven W. May, “Tudor Aristocrats and the Mythical ‘Stigma of Print,’” ''Renaissance Papers'' 10 (1980): 11-18. &lt;/ref&gt; courtly women writers “shared the prejudices towards print of their male counterparts”&lt;ref&gt;Michelle O’Callaghan, “Publication: Print and Manuscript,” in ''A Companion to English Renaissance Literature and Culture'', ed. Michael Hattaway (Malden: Blackwell, 2000) 81-94, at 83. As Margaret J. M. Ezell has suggested in ''The Patriarch’s Wife: Literary Evidence and the History of the Family'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1987), women’s choice of manuscript was not simply an issue of gender, but of class and “conservatism, the preference for an older form of literary transmission which left control of the text in the author’s hand rather than signing it over to the bookseller” (100).&lt;/ref&gt; and found in manuscript publication an attractive alternative, on account of its “social status, its personal appeal, relative privacy, freedom from government control, its cheapness, and its ability to make works quickly available to a select audience.”&lt;ref&gt;H. R. Woudhuysen, ''Sir Philip Sidney and the Circulation of Manuscripts, 1558–1640'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996), 15. See also Harold Love’s important study, ''Scribal Publication in Seventeenth-Century England'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993). Love maintains that there were “significant differences between the kinds of community formed by the exchange of manuscript” and those of print, “the most important … that the printed text, being available as an article of commerce, had no easy way of excluding readers” (183).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although manuscript publication potentially offered a greater degree of privacy and control over circulation than print, “it would be misleading,” Michelle O’Callaghan has suggested, “to distinguish between the two by confining manuscript publication to a private sphere and reserving the public sphere for print.”&lt;ref&gt;O’Callaghan, “Publication: Print and Manuscript,” 83. On the unclear distinction between public and private modes of production during this period, see also Lena Cowen Orlin, ''Private Matters and Public Culture in Post-Reformation England'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Edith Snook has noted that “manuscripts were not always absolutely private,” and that “textual exchange of handwritten texts could constitute an important part of social relationships.”&lt;ref&gt;Edith Snook, ''Women, Reading, and the Cultural Politics of Early Modern England'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2005), 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Margaret M. J. Ezell has argued that “once we leave behind the notion of authorship as an act defined by solitary alienation and the text as an isolated literary landmark,” we can better appreciate “writing for women and men” as both “a social activity as well as a means of private consolation.” &lt;ref&gt;Ezell, “Women and Writing,” 92. &lt;/ref&gt;Moreover, on this “vexed question of distinction between public and private,” Elizabeth Clarke has asserted that “manuscript writing in the early modern period cannot possibly be labeled private,” since “scribal publication continued to be an important social and political phenomenon alongside print culture well into the seventeenth century.”&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Clarke, “Women’s Manuscript Miscellanies in Early Modern England,” in ''Teaching Tudor and Stuart Women Writers'', ed. Susanne Woods and Margaret P. Hannay (New York: Modern Language Association of America, 2000), 52-60, at 57-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

“Poems produced within a manuscript culture,” Michelle O’Callaghan has argued, “actively participate in the social world in which they were produced and retain the impression of this environment.”&lt;ref&gt;O’Callaghan, “Publication: Print and Manuscript,” 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The Devonshire Manuscript certainly evidences its origins and circulation within the early Tudor court of Henry VIII, a body that was profoundly concerned with public and private performances of political loyalty and submission. Oftentimes these &quot;performances&quot; were realized in the form of texts produced especially for circulation at various levels within this specialized economy. As Seth Lerer has argued, “courtly verse” and other “literary products” of the early Tudor period routinely 

&lt;blockquote&gt;expose confusions and conflations among poetry and drama, private letters and public performances . . . . where the private acts itself before a spectatorial community, and where even the King’s chamber or the Queen’s bed could become the stages for the play of service.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Lerer, ''Courtly Letters in the Age of Henry VIII'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Devonshire Manuscript reflects this oscillation between public and private, between personal and communal: Within its pages, the private became public, the public was treated as private, and both were treated as deeply political. 

That the production of literature during the Tudor period inescapably possessed a political dimension is well established: “One striking phenomenon about early Tudor literature is that it was almost invariably concerned with politics, either directly or indirectly, and that this political bearing had a major impact on the nature of its literary forms.” Given that the overwhelming majority “of the writers of this period were courtiers and servants of the crown (or desired to be so), or else were directly affected by decisions taken at court,”&lt;ref&gt;Alistair Fox, ''Politics and Literature in the Reigns of Henry VI and Henry VIII'' (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1989), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; public and private literary production was both implicated within and producing of political context. In place of the direct statement and (possibly) politically charged declarative utterance, literary expression instead tended towards the opposite: “Social codes and political discretion determined that many of the things most writers desired to say could not be said openly, and as a result early Tudor literature is, above all, dramatized and indirect.”&lt;ref&gt;Fox, ''Politics and Literature'', 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Poetry became yet another venue for the performance of public and private roles within the royal court.

The circulation of love lyrics produced at court dramatizes the highly unstable division between public and private writing. The high dynastic stakes involved in the “literary and social parlour game” of which erotically-charged courtly love lyrics were a vital constitutive element especially encouraged the courtier-poet “to be ‘covert’ and ‘secree’—in a word, to ‘dissimulate.’”&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, “Riddling Erotic Identity in Early English Lyrics,” 8; John Stevens, ''Music and Poetry in the Early Tudor Court'' (London: Methuen, 1961), 216.&lt;/ref&gt; John Stevens, for example, highlights the motivation for the “oblique tone of many courtly love lyrics” as one of “covert communication . . . . or the pretence of it”:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The courtly love-lyric is, perhaps in essence, an enigma—a riddling, or dark, way of conveying your thoughts to someone who is, or pretends to be, your lover . . . . The lyric, although intended to be read or sung in society, to a present and observing audience, was another gambit of dissimulation. It was a public utterance which had, or pretended to have, a private meaning.&lt;ref&gt;John Stevens, ''Music and Poetry in the Early Tudor Court'' (London: Methuen, 1961), 216. Italics in original.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stevens’ example offers a possible context for the appropriation and repurposing of several medieval texts apparent within the Devonshire Manuscript, most noticeably the verses from Chaucer’s ''Troilus and Criseyde''. As pointed out above, these lines illustrate the fundamentally social nature of the text. They also, however, point to the need for occlusion and strategy within the social context of the Henrican court. Seth Lerer has argued persuasively that these excerpts illustrate how both Thomas Howard and Margaret Douglas were inscribed into the text of the Devonshire Manuscript: “If Thomas Howard represents . . . the Troilan lover, Margaret Douglas had lived as the object of personal desire and political exchange.”&lt;ref&gt;Lerer, ''Courtly Letters in the Age of Henry VIII'', 153.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his final analysis of the Devonshire Mansucript, Lerer states that the Chaucerian excerpts 

&lt;blockquote&gt;illustrate the pitfalls of impersonation, the dangers of being inscribed into the narratives of surreptitious love. For Margaret Douglas, and perhaps for Thomas Howard—living on in letters and in poems, transcribed into the accounts of chronicle, examination, and diplomacy—all the earth is, indeed, parchment scribable.&lt;ref&gt;Lerer, ''Courtly Letters in the Age of Henry VIII'', 156-57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the historically recorded aftermath of the Douglas-Howard marriage shows, the necessity for concealment and obfuscation within intra-courtly relations was far from a simple matter of style. The consequences for those who ran afoul of royal will could be dire, and that will was sometimes difficult to discern. 

For those closest to the King, navigating this treacherous terrain was exceptionally fraught:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To achieve a stable relationship with a master like Henry VIII was not easy: ‘Ricco, feroce et cupido di gloria’ [rich, fierce, and greedy for glory], as Niccolò Machiavelli had described the English king, he was capable alike of wrath and benign forgiveness, of diabolical cunning and childlike niaveté.&lt;ref&gt;Narasingha P. Sil, ''Tudor Placement and Statesmen: Select Case Histories'' (Cranbury, Associated University Presses, 2001), 20. Translation in Sil.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

A great deal of this “diabolical cunning,” it can be presumed, was oriented inwards towards the court itself. John Archer has pointed out that nowhere was political maneuvering more vital than “at the court of one’s own prince, who created and encouraged differences and jealousies among his servants, differences that he observed, and that caused them to watch each other in turn.”&lt;ref&gt;John Michael Archer, ''Sovereignty and Intelligence: Spying and Court Culture in the English Renaissance'' (Stanford, Stanford University Press, 1993), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The Howard-Douglas marriage discovery, by its very existence, operates within this context: If the sovereign rules effectively by incessantly and recursively dividing and monitoring the emergence of powerful groups opposed to the throne, then the unknown marriage of Margaret Douglas and Thomas Howard represents a massive failure of the surveillance apparatus.  In keeping with the character of the Tudor court, the two were almost immediately framed as a dangerously powerful faction angling for the throne. 

Characterized by Lacey Baldwin Smith as a “baffling composite of shifting silhouette,” Henry VIII occupied the center of an unstable constellation of shifting power relations, personal and political intrigue, and anxieties over a future Tudor dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Lacey Baldwin Smith, ''Henry VIII: The Mask of Royalty'' (London, Cape, 1971), 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In a “culture of surveillance that was chiefly defined by life at court,” where both external and internal monitoring were “influenced by practices and habits of thought cultivated at court,” the courtly lyric and the miscellany were both symptomatic of and constitutive of court culture.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, ''Sovereignty and Intelligence: Spying and Court Culture in the English Renaissance'', 3-4. &lt;/ref&gt; Both modes of literary communication operated as complex public/private utterances constructed to simultaneously impart and cloud meaning. They represent the courtly environment in microcosm. 

The Devonshire Manuscript, with its collection of courtly lyrics, its pastiche of medieval and contemporary poetry, its density of textual voices, its often uncertain authorship and attribution, is a powerful example of how textual production and interpretation were foundational to those communicating within the Tudor court.  A multivalent text, as Bradley Irish has demonstrated, the &quot;Devonshire MS reflects and refracts the gender dynamics of the contemporary Henrician court&quot; &lt;ref&gt;B. J. Irish, “Gender and Politics in the Henrician Court: The Douglas-Howard Lyrics in the Devonshire Manuscript.” ''Renaissance Quarterly.'' 64.1 (2011): 79-114, 81&lt;/ref&gt;. Contending that the “courtly life had always been a show, and the literature of courtliness has always been appreciated for its arabesques of the deceitful,” Lerer pointedly names the entire apparatus a “book of lies.”&lt;ref&gt;Lerer, ''Courtly Letters in the Age of Henry VIII'', 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current and Popular Contexts===
While mainstream fascination with Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn and the Tudor court has remained fairly consistent throughout the past several decades, recent years have seen a decided upsurge in interest in the period. Within popular culture, Showtime’s critically acclaimed series ''The Tudors'' and Hilary Mantel’s 2009 Man Booker Prize winning novel ''Wolf Hall'' signal a resurgent fascination with the historical personalities of early modern aristocracy. 

The Tudors incorporates several contributors to the Devonshire Manuscript: Thomas Wyatt, Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, and Sir Edmund Knyvett (in the form of Sir Anthony Knivert, a fictional composite) figure as fictional as characters in The Tudors. Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk (brother to Lord Thomas Howard of the Douglas-Howard lyrics), Margaret Tudor (mother to Lady Margaret Douglas), and Anne Boleyn feature prominently in various seasons of the show, dramatizing the centrality of the Devonshire Manuscript coterie to contemporary court politics.&lt;ref&gt;“Full Cast and Crew for ‘The Tudors,” http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758790/fullcredits#cast&lt;/ref&gt;

Although The Tudors is perhaps the best known manifestation of interest in the Henrican period in current popular culture, Hilary Mantel’s novel Wolf Hall fictionalizes many of the same characters and circumstances. Colin Burrows, in his review of the novel, notes that “Mantel’s chief method is to pick out tableaux vivants from the historical record—which she has worked over with great care—and then to suggest that they have an inward aspect which is completely unlike the version presented in history books.” In his view, the “chief running joke” of the novel is that “people and things which come to be of immense historical significance are within the novel unobserved and peripheral.” Burrows’ chief example of this is that “Mary Boleyn loses her book of love poems, and then remembers that her cousin Mary Shelton has it. This book of poems is presumably what is now known as the Devonshire Manuscript, the richest surviving record of early Tudor poetry and of the literary activities of early 16th-century women.”&lt;ref&gt;Colin Burrow, &quot;How to Twist a Knife.&quot; Rev. of ''Wolf Hall'', by Hilary Mantel. ''London Review of Books'' 31.8 (2009): 3-5. &lt;/ref&gt; Transformed into a fictional text, the Devonshire Manuscript is deployed yet again in a game of show and tell where only those “in the know” can interpret and shape its significance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section talks about the structure of Hawaiian, and simple things to note when
learning the language.

===Letters===
Hawaiian consists of h, k, l, m, n, p, w, and an 'okina, which represents a glottal stop in the
voice when speaking, as in the English phrase, uh-oh. The 'okina is basically an 
apostrophe between two vowels. The vowels are the same as in English, a, e, i, o, u, with one
exception: a kahakō can be placed over any vowel to make it's length increase- expressed as a line
over a vowel.

Note how ''hale'' (house) has a short ''a'', compared to ''kāne'' (man).

Another rule in Hawiian is that consonents can not double up. That is, they can't be side by side
in a word. Vowels have more freedom because they can lie next to each other, however consonents can
not. Consonents can not end a word either. The 'okina is considered a consonent.

==Voyager Missions==
The voyager missions were launched in order to study the outer solar system.
; Voyager 1 : Studied Jupiter, Saturn and is trudging on towards the heliopause. Presently the farthest human-made object from Earth.
; Voyager 2 : Studied Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Launched after, but with a higher velocity than Voyager 1.

This template diagnoses a problem with a subject page, suggests possible solutions, and provides buttons to implement them.  On entry here, it is known that parameter values cannot be automatically extracted from the subject page, but this could be either because the subject page does not exist, or because it does exist but is incorrectly formatted.
=== Usage ===
There are two required parameters, one of which can be blank.
* {{((}}{subject}{{))}} &amp;mdash; The name of the subject page with which there is a problem.
* {{((}}{origin}{{))}} &amp;mdash; The name of the previously visited subject page, ''if any'', which provided the value for {{((}}{subject}{{))}}; may be blank.
This template uses expensive parser function {{((}}#ifexist:{{))}} to determine whether the subject actually doesn't exist, or is merely misformatted.  If it actually doesn't exist, the solution may be to either to correct the page that provided the name {{((}}{subject}{{))}}, or to create the subject page.  And if {{((}}{origin}{{))}} is blank, the name {{((}}{subject}{{))}} was provided as a parameter to template {{tl|subject}}, so the page that needs correcting is the book page, {{((}}FULLPAGENAME{{))}}.

This is the terminating element of the series of integer-named sub-templates of template {{tl|subjects}}. 
=== Usage ===
Although this template is called using the usual numbered-template [[Template:Subjects/0|interface]] (the calling numbered template doesn't know whether it's calling another numbered template, or this one), only three of the parameters are ever used here.
* {{((}}{subject}{{))}} &amp;mdash; The name of the next subject.
* {{((}}{n}{{))}} &amp;mdash; The integer number ''after'' the number of the last existing numbered template in the series.
* {{((}}{diagnose}{{))}} &amp;mdash; Usually blank.  If non-blank, errors should be reported by messages, with suggested remedies and buttons to enact the remedies.
This template adds the current page to the allbooks category associated with the subject, and to {{nowrap|[[:Category:Attention needed (allbooks)]]}}, the attention needed being the creation of another numbered sub-template, numbered {{((}}{n}{{))}}.  If {{((}}{diagnose}{{))}} is non-blank, a message is generated explaining what needs to be done and providing a button to do it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

; Energy storage 
: is accomplished by devices or physical media that store some form of energy to perform some useful operation at a later time. 

A device that stores energy is sometimes called an accumulator such as is used on the London Tower bridge. All forms of energy are either potential energy (e.g. Chemical, gravitational, electrical energy, etc.) or kinetic energy. A wind-up clock stores potential energy (spring tension - mechanical), a battery stores chemical energy, and a hydroelectric dam stores energy in a reservoir as gravitational potential energy. Fossil fuels including coal and gasoline are chemical energy as is the food we eat.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Long gamma-ray bursts ===
Most observed events have a duration of greater than two seconds and are classified as long gamma-ray bursts. Because these events constitute the majority of the population and because they tend to have the brightest afterglows, they have been studied in much greater detail than their short counterparts. Almost every well-studied long gamma-ray burst has been linked to a galaxy with rapid star formation, and in many cases to a core-collapse supernova as well. 
Long GRB afterglow observations, at high redshift, are also consistent with the GRB having originated in star-forming regions.
A unique gamma ray emission event, GRB 110328A, lasting more than two and a half months was observed starting March 28, 2011, originating from the center of a small galaxy at redshift z = 0.3534. The event is interpreted as a supermassive black hole devouring a star, most likely a white Dwarf and emitting its beam of radiation towards Earth. It could thus be viewed as a temporarily active blazar (a type of Quasar).

===Short gamma-ray bursts===
Events with a duration of less than about two seconds are classified as short gamma-ray bursts. These account for about 30% of gamma-ray bursts, but until 2005, no afterglow had been successfully detected from any short event and little was known habout their origins.  Since then, several dozen short gamma-ray burst afterglows have been detected and localized, several of which are associated with regions of little or no star formation, such as large elliptical galaxies and the central regions of large galaxy clusters. This rules out a link to massive stars, confirming that short events are physically distinct from long events. In addition, there has been no association with supernovae. The true nature of these objects (or even whether the current classification scheme is accurate) remains unknown, although the leading hypothesis is that they originate from the mergers of binary neutron stars or a neutron star with a black hole. 
The observation of minutes to hours of X-ray flashes after a short gamma-ray burst is consistent with small particles of a primary object like a neutron star initially swallowed by a black hole in less than two seconds, followed by some hours of lesser energy events, as remaining fragments of tidally-disrupted neutron star material (no longer neutronium) remain in orbit to spiral into the black hole, over a longer period of time. A small fraction of short gamma-ray bursts are probably produced by giant flares from soft gamma repeaters in nearby galaxies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The international governing body of football, International Federation of Association Football, or as the French say [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA Fédération Internationale de Football Association] (FIFA), has long refuse the use of goal-line and other technologies within the game [1].


It’s up to referees and linesmen to make the important calls that mean the difference between winning and losing. Football has had its fair share of wrong decisions; goals that were disallowed, non-goal that were allowed and fouls that went unnoticed [2]. 


[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_line_technology Goal-line technology] (GLT) is a technology which determines if the ball has completely crosses the goal line, thus assisting the referees in the decision to call goal or not [2].


FIFA is now testing potential candidates for GLT, including [[Sport Innovation/Goal-line Technology/Nine Technology Systems being tested by FIFA|nine different systems]] including [[Sport Innovation/Goal-line Technology/Cairos GLT System|Cairos GLT System]] and [[Sport Innovation/Goal-line Technology/Goalminder|Goalminder]]. A series of tests will be conducted over the coming months that will determine the accuracy of the technology under differing settings and scenarios [1]. 


FIFA have laid down [[Sport Innovation/Goal-line Technology/FIFA Testing Criteria for Goal-line technologies|strict testing criteria]] that the nine systems will have to meet in order to proceed through to the second phase of testing.


Although the debate to introduce GLT as well as other technologies has been going on for over a decade, the most recent and controversial [[/The trigger that caused the need to further investigate goal-line technologies/|trigger]] reigniting the debate was in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup 2010 FIFA World Cup] held in South Africa. Over the years there has been legitimate arguments both [[Sport Innovation/Goal-line Technology/Arguments for the introduction of goal-line technology|for]] and [[Sport Innovation/Goal-line Technology/Arguments against the introduction of goal-line technology|against]] the introduction of GLT [3].


However, it is ultimately FIFA's decision as to whether or not technology is introduced into the sport of football [4]. The fact that FIFA are testing nine different goal-line technologies and have discussed its possible inclusion in the 2012-13 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Premier_League English Premier League] proves to be positive step into the [[Sport Innovation/Goal-line Technology/Football, Technology and the future|future]] [1]. It is clear that the introduction of technology in football has the potential to reduce human error and to make goal-line controversies a thing of the past [5].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview of virus entry==
Even though viruses are not complex and quite simple in terms of their structure and their components, the way they interact with host cells are quite complex. In order to enter the cell, animal viruses utilize a wide variety of cellular processes that deal with numerous cellular proteins. Even though some viruses are able to go into the cytosol through the plasma membrane, the majority of the viruses rely on endocytic uptake, vesicular transport via the cytoplasm, and the transportation to the endosomes and the other intracellular organelles. This process of taking in the viruses are associated with clathrin-mediated endocytosis, macropinocytosis, caveolar/lipid raft-mediated endocytosis, or other mechanisms. There are many ways and endocytic mechanisms that animal viruses utilize to allow a virus to enter a cell. 

[[File:Endocytosis types.svg|thumb|Membrane Proteins]]

==Introduction of virus entry==
Initially viruses attach to the cell surface of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. The interactions virus receptors usually are specific and have at least 3 valences. In addition, these interactions result in the activation of cellular signaling pathways. Cells react by incorporating the viruses utilizing a few endocytic mechanisms. After the viruses go in the lumen of endosomes or the endoplasmic reticulum, they obtain signals which are in the form of being exposed to low pH, proteolytic cleavage, and the initiation of viral proteins. These cause modifications in the viral proteins, and then they are able to penetrate the vacuolar membrane. After they penetrate the vacuolar membrane, they pass the viral genome, the caspid, or the viral particle that is kept together into the cytosol. Afterwards, the majority of RNA viruses replicate at a variety of positions within the cytosol. In contrast, most DNA viruses continue through their passage towards to the nucleus. A process that consists of steps that dissemble and uncoat operate parallel with the movement of the virus and viral capsids deeper into the cell. This whole process results in a regulated dispersion of the genome and accessory proteins in a replication-competent form. 

It is important to study and understand the virus-host cell interactions for a variety of reasons. Number one,the threat and potential damage that pathogens and viruses can cause are growing exponentially due to many factors like the world population growing larger, the immense increase in international trade and travel, and global warming. Therefore, it is extremely important and helpful to obtain as much information that can assist in the fight against viruses that are currently present or viruses that can potentially come up in the future. The study of the interactions between viruses and the cell is a growing field with many undiscovered details that can assist in developing strategies to deal with viruses. 

Another important reason to study the interaction between viruses and cells is that viruses can be utilized as instruments in molecular medicine. Viruses have developed to the point where they can enter cells and bring in foreign genes and macromolecules. This is why they are very useful in gene therapy and transporting macromolecules and drugs into cells. In addition, they viruses of have the capacity to perhaps be able to pinpoint cancer cells and exterminate them. Viruses are an ever increasing important instrument that scientists can utilize and manipulate to develop new strategies and concepts of in the field of molecular, structural and cell biology.

==Advantages of entry through endocytosis==
Morphological, genetic, and biochemical studies of bacteriophages have shown that the mechanisms of infection are extremely complicated. They also showed that the formation of coliphages T4 and T2 are made like hypodermic syringes with a tail that is capable of contracting. This creates a machinery that has the ability to strike through the two membranes of a gram-negative bacteria and penetrate the cytosol to send in the DNA. It was discovered that attachment to host cell receptors have the function of being a signal that activates the process of injection. Because the host cells of animal cells do not have the outer membrane and cell wall, they do not require complex and elaborate tools and mechanism to enter the cell. In contrast, bacteria has these cell wall and membranes that inhibit the pathway to the plasma membrane. In addition, animal cells give endocytic mechanisms that send viruses that come in advantages that bacteriophages do not possess. Endocytic vesicles carry viruses that come in from the outer edges to the perninuclear area of the host cell, where the conditions for infection are encouraged and the distance is minimized towards the nucleus. In effect, this enables viruses to cross through obstacles freely that deal with cytoplasmic bunching up and the complex construction of microfilaments in the cortex. The ability to travel through the endocytic vesicles is especially crucial for viruses that infect neurons, where the separate axons from the cell body have very long distances. Also the maturation of endosomes that have slowly changing conditions, like lowering of pH or the switching of a redox environment, enables viruses to detect their position within a cell and the passage. This will also allow the endosomes to utilize this information to put a time of penetration and uncoating. When certain proteases like furin and cathespins are present they give the required proteolytic activation of speciic viruses. In addition, when animals viruses are endocytosed, they are able to avoid leaving evidence of them being exposed on the plasma membrane.It is important to avoid leaving evidence of them being exposed on the plasma membrane because then it would result in a delay in being detected by immunosurveillance. Combined as one, endocytosis contains numerous advantages that cause viruses, like herpes simplex virus 1 and human immunodefiency virus 1 to utilize endocytic pathways for productive entrance rather than entering directly. 

The study of viral endocytosis has been combined with reviews on endocytoic pathways. It is important understand both of these aspects in these topics of wide range.

==Viruses as Endocytic Carriers==
Animal viruses have sizes that range from approximately 30&amp;nbsp;nm for parvoviruses to 40&amp;nbsp;nm for poxviruses. The majority of viruses lie in the 60 to 150&amp;nbsp;nm range. Even though viruses are typically shaped like a sphere, there are other viruses like Filovirus, Paramyxovirus, and influenza virus that can be fibrous and very stretched apart. When they attach to cells, viruses do not become disfigured. On the other hand, the plasma membrane changes shape usually to adjust to the shape of the virus. There are a few instances were invagination is necessary for endocytosis. The outer layer of viruses is usually covered proteins that attach to receptors in the form of caspid proteins formed in a n icosaherdral grid or as spike glycoprotein that span the entire viral envelope. The separate interactions with the receptors are usually weak, but interaction with many different receptor cause the activity to increase really high which causes the binding to cells almost impossible to reverse. Multivalent binding causes receptors to cluster, which may cause an association with lipid domains and activation of signaling pathways.

At the time when virus particles arrive at the endosomes, the virus particles are usually similar in size to the intralumenal vesicles. When they are too large to fit into the narrow tubular extensions, they are usually localized to the bulbous, vacuolar areas of the endosomes and are organized to the degradative pathway.

Viruses usually in the past have been utilized as model cargo in endocytosis and membrane trafficking studies. By using an electron microscopy one can easily recognize these viruses and they can be identified with fluorescent groups or proteins, which enable single-particle location and monitoring in live cells. By giving a focused source of light, the center of mass of fluorescent viruses can be accurately outlined using a point-spread function. Because infection causes amplification, when viruses have successfully entered the cell, it can be easily measured, even with very small amounts of virus. Also the many studies of virology has created numerous tools, like virus mutants, fluorescent viruses, antibodies, expression systems, and modified host cells.

Lipid raft function to control the signaling, fluidity and receptor functions on the membrane. These are usually rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids. Viruses that use the Caveolar/Raft-dependent pathways form primary endocytic vesicles that are dependent on cholesterol, lipid rafts, and complex signaling pathways. These ways use tyrosine kinases, phosphatases, and glycophingolipids.  The process is started by the ligands and the site of penetration for these viruses is the ER. One of the most studied virus that uses this pathway is the polyomavirus. These viruses make use of the multiple receptors available in order to bind better. 

==Attachment Factors and Receptors==
Even though some viruses utilize receptors that have defined endocytic receptor functions, like transferrin and low-density lipoprotein receptors, the majority of molecules that viruses attach to deals with different functions like cell to cell recognition, ion transpotation, and attachment to the extracellular matrix. Most of the time the carbohydrate moieties serve as a important function in the binding of viruses. 

It is important and helpful to distinguish the difference between attachment factors that simply attach viruses and therefore assist them to focus the viruses on the top area of the cell, and virus receptors that function as a trigger to modify the viruses, promote cellular signaling, or activate penetration. One objective that a lot of receptors have in common is that they encourage endocytosis and they assist the virus into the cell. A lot of the time, when the viruses enter, they begin with binding to attachment factors. Afterwards they interact with other receptors. In reality, it is hard to distinguish the difference between attachment factors and receptors because both of them play a role in the effectiveness of the infection.

The attachment factor that is most seen is called glycosaminoglycan chains in proteogylcans. Attaching to these negatively charged polysaccharides is typically electrostatic and somewhat not specific. There has been identification that in some instances viruses evolve to utilzie GAGs when they adjust to the development in tissue culture. Another common category of carbohydrates consist of sialic acids, to which many viruses attach to. Similar to the situation with influenza and polyomaviruses, the majority of the time, this attachment is very specific and deals with lectin domains or lectin sites.

Because binding is very specific, this is a significant cause in determining tropism and species specificity and therefore one can tell the nature of viral diseases. One other dimension of receptor specificity is that it can identify the choice of endocytic pathway and intracellular routing that the viruses there are coming in will travel through. In this specific instance, parvoviruses that bind to the transferrin receptor utilize clathrin-mediated uptake passage. They are also capable to recycle to cell surface with their receptor. In contrast, not as significantly present groups like rhinoviruses that bind to the LDL receptor break apart from the receptor in early endosomes and taken to the late endosomes.

There are a few receptors that have the job of promoting modifications the virus that allows attachment of the virus to a coreceptor, promotion of endocytic uptake, or transformation to configuration that is membrane fusion-active. The most suitable defined case is HIV-1. This is because in this case two receptors are necessary to promote conformational modifications to promote the fusion. Adenoviruses 2 and 5 contain two receptors that promote conformational modifications and encourage endocytosis. For the avian leukosis virus, the signals necessary to entrance are receptor binding in conjunction with low levels of pH.

==How viruses hijack cell regulation SLiMs==
	
How viruses hijack cell regulation
SLiMs
	Virus' life cycle is shaped by the interactions they have with cellular proteins. They can take over and use proteins for their own interest for their mechanisms. However, viruses are compact spatial constrained with tiny genomes, yet they can command so many pathways and processes. One of the reason they are able to do so is by extensive mimicry of host protein short linear motifs (SliMs).
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:LxCxE bound to Retinoblastoma.png|The Human papilloma virus E7 oncoprotein mimic of the LxCxE motif (red) bound to the host Retinoblastoma protein (dark grey)(PDB 1gux.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
	
	 When viruses enter the cell, they have their own DNA and RNA polymerases, helicases and proteases, which enable replication, expression, and maturation. But, the virus still needs the cell to help with viral replication. Compact non globular protein interaction interfaces known as SliMs are present in eukaryotic proteomes. They have a wide variety of specific functions, such as the ability to encode a functional interaction interface in a short sequence, participation in a region of proteins, and capacity to function independently, and convergently evolve. Their functions include targeting proteins to specific destinations, acting as recognition sites for proteolytic cleavage, and provide specific modifications., signaling, recognition, rewiring pathways, molecular switching. 
	
	There are a diverse set of host pathways targeted and their functionality. Some of them include the host target 14-3-3 by viral protein Rep68 with Virus AAV with the Motif RsxSxP. Another example is host target ALIX by viral protein Gag for HIV with motif LYPxxxL. Thus, there are many different mechanisms by how viruses use the motifs.
	
	One of the mechanism is cellular transport. Directing proteins to destinations require large complexes or cytoskeletal structure of micro tubules. Consequently, viral proteins use the vast cellular infrastructure by copying the motifs. For example, signal mimicry is the driving force of the essential regulatory protein Rev of HIV. 

	Another mechanism is signal transduction. SliMs have low binding affinities and fast off-rates, which promotes fast reaction in response to variation stimuli. Thus, viruses copies the signaling motifs and deregulate their pathways. 

	A 3rd mechanism is controlling cellular protein levels. Viral proteins play roles as scaffolds, by redirecting substrate specificity to unconventional host protein targets. For example, in ubiquity ligage recruitment, the virus hijacks the cell resulting in polyubiquitylation of the host, followed by proteasonal degradation. By doing so, the cellular protein is altered, which enables the viral proteins to survive and replicate their genome. Destruction motifs can also be used to inhibit the destruction of the proteins as well, which can prolong the lives of pro viral proteins. 

	A 4th mechanism is transcriptional regulation, which is a very tightly controlled cellular process. Even so, even its regulation can be degraded by motifs mimicry. 
	
	A 5th mechanism is to modify the host proteome by deregulation of endogenous modification processes. Viral proteins can act as scaffolds between host enzymes and viral targets. A single modification can ultimately result in modifying an entire genome. 

	A 6th mechanism is their own modification. Viral proteins can also direct their own modification by mimicking docking and modification sites of host enzymes.  

	Viruses must use motifs because the regular function of the cell is largely controlled by SliMs. They are evolution's results to rewire cellular regulatory pathways, which makes them equally vulnerable to the faster evolving viral proteins, allowing the viral proteins to deregulate the pathways. 

	SliMs length, which are 3-10 residues long, allows it to convergently evolve. Usually, only one or two mutations are necessary for the creation of a new motif. RNA viruses usually go through 10^-5 – 10^-3 mutations in each position in a generation, while DNA viruses usually go through 10^-8 – 10^-5. Convergent evolution of these viral motifs can be examined through viral strains and isolations. Phenotype variations of the viral proteins are due to the adaption of motif specificity. 

	 The size of viral genomes are largely restricted, yet they still interact extensively with the host cell. Once the viral protein acquires the interaction with the protein interface, it alters a pre-folded region, but the host cannot operate under multiple binding sites that are close to each other, so they do not have the ability to interact with a number of these distinct partners because they are spatially restricted. Viral proteomes usually have folded structures. Generally, a globular interface is not needed for the viral to take over a process, but nevertheless, multiple contrasting mechanisms are available to manipulate a specific pathway or protein.

	Eukaryote regulatory systems are robust, due to the cellular networks cooperation. Viruses can also use the mechanisms to also be robust. The small sizes of motifs also enable viral proteins to be robust against the mutations and adaptions. Mimicry of SliMs are also robust.

== You recently created pages ==

Hi, you recently created a number of Wikibooks pages including [[Goalminder]], [[Nine Technology Systems being tested by FIFA]] and others.  Please note that Wikibooks is for the creation of ''books'' so these pages should ideally be part of one book.  The book title could be, for example, [[FIFA Technologies]] with each of the recently created pages part of that book, for example [[FIFA Technologies/Goalminder]].  What title do you want for your book?--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:08, 26 November 2011 (UTC)
:: I have now discovered that those pages are part of the [[Sport Innovation]] book.  I have moved the 4 pages you created into this book.  I have also linked to the pages from the Sport Innovation front page.  The new locations of the books are:
* [[Sport Innovation/Arguments for the introduction of goal-line technology|Arguments for the introduction of goal-line technology]]
* [[Sport Innovation/Arguments against the introduction of goal-line technology|Arguments against the introduction of goal-line technology]]
* [[Sport Innovation/Goalminder|Goalminder]]

'''''Pfuiteufel !'''''{{spaces|5}}(''German'') ''Pfui'' is the German for ''[[wikt:fie|fie!]]'' and ''Teufel'' means ''Devil''. Together, ''Pfui Teufel!'' means ''Disgusting! Yuck! Ugh!

'''''il se promène, lisant au livre de lui-même'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''he strolls about, reading in the book of himself''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 200.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Best is misquoting from a [[w:Prose poetry|prose poem]] by [[w:Stéphane Mallarmé|Stéphane Mallarmé]], ''[[:fr:s:Hamlet_et_Fortinbras_(Stéphane_Mallarmé)|Hamlet et Fortinbras]]'', which first appeared as a letter in ''[[:fr:w:La Revue blanche|La Revue blanche]]'' on 15 July 1896:&lt;ref&gt;Stéphane Mallarmé, ''Hamlet et Fortinbras'', ''La Revue blanche'', 15 July 1896.&lt;/ref&gt;

|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
| &lt;poem&gt;''Un impresario, dans une province mêlée à mon adolescence, épigraphiait HAMLET, qu’il représenta, du sous-titre ou le DISTRAIT : cet homme d’un goût français joliment, entendait, je suppose, préparer, par là, le public à la singularité qu’Hamlet seul compte et qu’à l’approcher, quiconque s’efface, succombe, disparaît. La pièce, un point culminant du Théâtre, est, dans l’œuvre de Shakespeare, transitoire entre la vieille action multiple et le Monologue ou drame avec Soi, futur. Le héros ; tous comparses : il se promène, pas plus, lisant au livre de lui-même, haut et vivant signe ; nie du regard les autres.''

''Il ne se contentera pas d’exprimer la solitude, parmi les gens, de qui pense ; il tue indifféremment ou, du moins, on meurt. La noire présence du douteur cause ce poison, que tous les personnages trépassent : sans même que lui prenne toujours la peine de les percer, dans la tapisserie. Alors, placé, certes, comme contraste à l’hésitant, Fortinbras, en tout qu’un général ; mais sans plus de valeur et si la mort, fiole, étang de nénuphars et fleuret, déchaîne tout son apparat varié, dont porte la sobre livrée ici quelqu’un d’exceptionnel, cela importe, comme finale et dernier mot, au moment où se reprend le spectateur, que cette somptueuse et stagnante exagération de meurtre, dont l’idée reste la leçon, autour de Qui se fait Seul — pour ainsi dire s’écoule vulgairement par un passage d’armée, vidant la scène avec un appareil de destruction actif, à la portée de tous et ordinaire, parmi le tambour et les trompettes.''
&lt;/poem&gt;
| &lt;poem&gt;''An impresario in a province inextricably linked to my adolescence added as an epigraph to HAMLET, which he was staging, the subtitle “or THE ABSENT-MINDED MAN”. This man of French taste amusingly meant, I suppose, to prepare the public thereby for the peculiarity which is unique to Hamlet and to which one who effaces himself succumbs and disappears. The play, a pinnacle in the history of drama, is, in Shakespeare’s output, transitional between the old many-handed action and the monologue or drama of Self, which was yet to come. The hero; all the extras: he walks about, no more, reading in the book of himself a high and living sign; he denies others his regard [scorns to look at others].''

''He will not be content to express [embody] the solitude of the Thinker, while surrounded by others; he kills indifferently – or at least, people die. The dark presence of the doubter is the cause of this poison, so that all the main characters die, even without his having to take the trouble to stab them behind the arras. Then there is Fortinbras, introduced, no doubt, as a contrast to the procrastinator; every inch a general, but having no greater influence [on the action than Hamlet]. And if Death (phial, weeping brook and foil) unleashes all his varied pageantry, the sobre livery of which someone exceptional wears here, it is to signify, as finale and closing words, at the moment the spectator is returning to his senses, that this sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder around Him who chooses the path of Solitude (which is the whole point of the play) is cast so to speak in vulgar form with the passing of an army, clearing the stage with an active instrument of destruction, commonplace and accessible to all, to the accompaniment of trumpets and drums.''
&lt;/poem&gt;

'''''limbo patrum'''''{{spaces|5}}In Catholic theology, [[w:Limbo|Limbo]] is the name for a place or state occupied by the souls of those who have not been admitted to Heaven but who have not merited the eternal damnation of Hell. The name comes from the Latin expression ''in limbo'', meaning ''on the border'', as Limbo was imagined to form the borderland of Hell.

In theological usage the name is applied to (a) the temporary place or state of the souls of the just who, although purified from sin, were excluded from the beatific vision until Christ's triumphant ascension into Heaven (the ''limbus patrum'' or ''border of the fathers'') or (b) to the permanent place or state of those unbaptized children and others who, dying without grievous personal sin, are excluded from the beatific vision on account of original sin alone (the ''limbus infantium'' or ''limbus puerorum'', ''border of infants'' or ''border of children'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_%281913%29/Limbo ''Catholic Encyclopedia.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fathers, ''Patres'', are specifically the [[w:Patriarchs (Bible)|Patriarchs of the Old Testament]], the righteous men and women who were not admitted to Heaven until Christ's [[w:Harrowing of Hell|Harrowing of Hell]]. Stephen's use of the term, therefore, is theologically incorrect, as the soul of Hamlet's father would have had no business being in ''limbo patrum''.

In Elizabethan England, however, ''Limbo Patrum'' was a slang term for prison.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 203.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 161.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase occurs in [[w:William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[w:John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher's]] play ''[[w:Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]'' 5:4:67-68: ''I have some of 'em in Limbo Patrum, and there they are like to dance these three days;''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Life_of_King_Henry_the_Eighth ''Henry VIII'' 5:4:67-68.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same scene Paris is held up as an exemplar of corruption.

'''''absit nomen'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''let the name be absent''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 207.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen is alluding to the Latin precept ''absit nomen, absit omen'' (''If you do not utter an ill-omened expression, you will not incur the bad luck attendant on it''). The second half of this phrase, ''absit omen'' (''let there be no [ill] omen''), is used on its own as an [[wikt:apotropaic|apotropaic]] phrase to ward off any possible bad luck that might attend the uttering of an ill-omened term; today one might knock on wood to achieve the same effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Slang and Euphemism |last=Spears |first=Richard A. |year=1981 |publisher=Jonathan David Publishers, Inc. |location=New York |isbn=0-8246-0273-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ta an bad ar an tir. Taim imo shagart'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Errata'') These Irish expressions should read: ''Tá an bád ar an tír. Táim i mo shagart.'' When an earlier draft of this chapter was printed in ''[[w:The Little Review|The Little Review]]'' in April 1919, the reading was the same as appears here.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.lib.brown.edu/repository2/repoman.php?verb=render&amp;id=129892512531252&amp;view=pageturner&amp;pageno=42 ''The Little Review'', Volume 5, Number 12, p. 40.]&lt;/ref&gt;


'''''Tá an bád ar an tír. Táim i mo shagart'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Irish'') ''The boat is on the land. I am a priest.''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 217.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The first sentence is very close to one in Eugene O'Growney's ''Simple Lessons in Irish''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Simple Lessons in Irish: Part 1 |last=O'Growney |first=Eugene |year=1897 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=22 |url=http://archive.org/stream/SimpleLessonsInIrishPart1Ogrowney/SimpleLessonsInIirishPart1RevEugene0growney#page/n20/mode/1up}} §57 includes the sentence: ''Atá an bád ar tír'' (''There is a boat on land'').&lt;/ref&gt; The author was a Catholic priest, which probably accounts for the second sentence. In ''Stephen Hero'', we are told that when Stephen Daedalus undertakes a course of lessons in Irish, ''He bought the O'Growney's primers published by the Gaelic League''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stephen Hero |last=Joyce |first=James |year=1986 |publisher=Grafton Books |location=London |isbn=0-586-04477-9 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Father O'Growney's portrait hangs over the mantelpiece in the classroom where Stephen learns Irish.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''. p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;


'''beurla'''{{spaces|5}}(''Irish, Hiberno-English'') ''The English language''. The Irish word ''beurla'' (now spelt ''béarla'') originally meant ''language'', ''speech'', ''dialect'', but gradually replaced ''Saics-Bhéarla'' (''the Saxon tongue''). Eugene O'Growney gave ''beurla'' as the spelling in 1897,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.org/stream/SimpleLessonsInIrishPart2OGrowney/SimpleLessonsInIrishPart2Rev.EugeneOGrowney#page/n23/mode/2up Eugene O'Growney, ''Simple Lessons in Irish'', Part 2, §332, p.25.]&lt;/ref&gt; but Patrick S. Dinneen gave ''béarla''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.org/stream/irishenglishdict011837mbp#page/n82/mode/1up Patrick S. Dinneen, ''Irish-English Dictionary'' 61-62.]&lt;/ref&gt;


'''A basilisk. ''E quando vede l'uomo l'attosca''. Messer Brunetto'''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''And when it looks at men it poisons them''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 217-218.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 176.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[wikt:basilisk|basilisk]] is a mythical beast hatched by a cockerel from the egg of a serpent, and said to be so venomous that even its glance is deadly. [[w:Brunetto Latini|Brunetto Latini]] was a Florentine scholar of the 13th-century. Among his works is ''Li Livres dou Trésor'' (''The Books of the Treasury''), an encyclopaedia in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Li Livres dou Trésor |last=Latini |first=Brunetto |year=1863 |publisher=Imprimerie Impériale |location=Paris |pages=192-193 |url=http://archive.org/stream/lilivresdoutreso00latiuoft#page/192/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was translated into Italian as ''Il Tesoro de Brunetto Latini'' (''The Treasury of Brunetto Latini''), commonly misattributed to Bono Giamboni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Il Tesoro de Brunetto Latini volgarizzato da Bono Giamboni |year=1887 |publisher= |location=Bologna |pages=137-139 |url=http://archive.org/stream/iltesoro02lati#page/137/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Book 5, Chapter 3, ''Della natura del basilischio'' (''On the nature of the basilisk''), includes the remark, which Stephen misremembers: ''e col suo vedere attosca l'uomo quando lo vede'' (''and with its sight it poisons men when it looks at them''). The original French version is: ''et de sa veue tue les homes quant il les voit'' (''and with its sight kills men when it looks at them'').

Although Stephen misremembers the Italian quotation, Joyce apparently did not, for he quotes it correctly in ''Giacomo Joyce'' 15: As I come out of Ralli's house I come upon her [Amalia Popper] suddenly as we both are giving alms to a blind beggar. She answers my sudden greeting by turning and averting her black basilisk eyes. ''E col suo vedere attosca l'uomo quando lo vede''. I thank you for the word, messer Brunetto.

Ser Brunetto Latini was a guardian and teacher of Dante, who mentions both him and ''Il Tesoro'' in the ''Inferno'' 15. ''Messer'' and ''Ser'' are old forms of address, meaning ''My Sire'' and ''Sire''.

'''''L'art d'être grand...'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Errata'') This should read: ''L'art d'être grandp...''. The final ''p'' was present when an earlier draft of this episode was published in ''[[w:The Little Review|The Little Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.lib.brown.edu/repository2/repoman.php?verb=render&amp;id=129892512531252&amp;view=pageturner&amp;pageno=43 ''The Little Review'', Volume 5, Number 12, p. 41.]&lt;/ref&gt; ''L'art d'être grand'' is the French for ''The art of being great'', but this erratum is included in the errata list that Joyce himself compiled for the fourth impression of the first edition of ''Ulysses'' (January 1924).


'''''L'art d'être grandp...'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''The art of being a grandf...''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 221.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 180.&lt;/ref&gt; ''L'Art d'être grand-père'' (''The Art of Being A Grandfather'') is a collection of poems for children by [[w:Victor Hugo|Victor Hugo]]; they were written for Hugo's own grandchildren and published in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:fr:L’Art d’être grand-père|L’Art d’être grand-père]]''&lt;/ref&gt;


'''''buonaroba'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''good stuff''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 222.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 181.&lt;/ref&gt; In Elizabethan England ''[[wikt:bona roba|bona roba]]'' was a slang term for a showy wanton, a wench, a flashy girl.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofengl01johnuoft#page/n277/mode/1up Samuel Johnson, ''Dictionary of the English Language''.]&lt;/ref&gt; The term occurs twice in Shakespeare's works, ''II Henry IV'' 3.2.26 and 3.2.217, though neither occurrence has any particular relevance for the point Stephen is making.

'''''Entr'acte'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''a short, usually comic and musical, performance in the interval between two acts of a play or opera''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen anticipates that Mulligan's arrival will interrupt the serious discussion and precipitate a comic interlude.


'''''Was Du verlachst wirst Du noch dienen'''''{{spaces|5}}(''German'') ''That which you deride you shall nevertheless serve''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 224.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 183-184.&lt;/ref&gt; This phrase is usually glossed as a German proverb, but Joyce's source has not yet been identified.


'''''Glo-o-ri-a in ex-cel-sis De-o'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''Glory to God in the highest''. See [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Lotus_Eaters/079|079.11]]. The musical quotation is taken from a [[w:Plainchant|Plainchant]] setting of the ''Gloria'' in the ''[[w:Liber Usualis|Liber Usualis]]'' for ''Missa IV, In Festis II Classis 1'' (''Mass IV, For Feasts of the Second Class, Number 1'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://musicasacra.com/pdf/liberusualis.pdf ''Liber Usualis'' 26.] For the same chant in modern notation, see [http://quilisma-publications.info/pdf%20files/Full%20Liber%20Usualis/%2800%29%20Liber%20Usualis,%20Pp%20001-100.pdf ''Liber Usualis'' 26.]&lt;/ref&gt; 16 June is the feast of the French Jesuit [[w:John Francis Regis|St John Francis Regis]].

'''Cours la Reine'''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''The Queen's Path''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 230.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[w:Cours-la-Reine|Cours la Reine]] is a promenade and public park on the right bank of the Seine in Paris. It was created in 1618 by Queen Marie de Medicis.


'''''Encore vingt sous. Nous ferons de petites cochonneries. Minette? Tu veux?'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''Twenty more sous. We'll fool around. You want to eat some nice pussy?''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen recalls an encounter with a prostitute on the Cours-la-Reine. ''Sou'' is a colloquial term for five ''[[w:Centime|centimes]]'' or one twentieth of a [[w:Franc|franc]], though the actual coin disappeared when the French currency was decimalized in 1795; the prostitute is demanding ''another franc''. ''Faire de petites cochonneries'' (''to do little swinish things'') is slang for fornication and other sexual perversions. ''Faire minette'' (''to do pussy'') is slang for [[w:Cunnilingus|cunnilingus]].

Today the present infinitive (''mingere'') is usually placed second, but stephen's order corresponds to that of older textbooks such as ''Adam's Latin Grammar''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ie/books?id=A6IAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Adam's Latin Grammar''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[w:Finnegans Wake|Finnegans Wake]]'' (pages 185-186) Joyce associates the creative act of writing ''Ulysses'' and other works with both defecation and micturition.

'''''Sufflaminandus sum'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''I should be checked''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 236-237.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 198.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Roman rhetorician [[w:Seneca the Elder|Seneca the Elder]], the Emperor [[w:Augustus|Augustus]] once said ''Haterius noster sufflaminandus est'' (''Our Haterius ought to be checked'') in reference to the senator and orator [[w:Quintus Haterius|Quintus Haterius]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/seneca.contr4.html ''Controversies'' 4:7]&lt;/ref&gt; Haterius spoke so rapidly that he employed someone to warn him to slow down. Augustus joked that his puffs of air needed a brake: Augustus conflated the verb ''sufflo'' (''to inflate'') with the noun ''sufflamen'' (a bar used on wagons as a brake).&lt;ref&gt;Joy Connolly, ''The State of Speech: Rhetoric and Political Thought in Ancient Rome'', Princeton University Press (2007). [http://books.google.ie/books?id=8YH6SnJVqB4C&amp;pg=PA247&amp;lpg=PA247#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Shakespearean context, there is also a reference to [[w:Ben Jonson|Ben Jonson's]] remark about Shakespeare: ''... he flowed with that facility, that sometime it was necessary he should be stopped: ''Sufflaminandus erat'', as Augustus said of Haterius.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/stream/timberordiscove00jonsgoog#page/n67/mode/1up/search/Shakespeare ''Timber: or, Discoveries Made Upon Men or Matter''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly, Jonson misunderstood Augustus's pun. He took Augustus to mean, ''Haterius should be fitted with a gag [on account of the volubility of his rhetoric]'', whereas the correct meaning is, ''Haterius should be fitted with a brake [on account of the rapidity of his rhetoric]''. But Jonson was probably Stephen's (and Joyce's) source.

See also [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Scylla_and_Charybdis/177|177.19]], which quotes from the same passage in Jonson's ''Timber''.


'''''Amplius. In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia inter multos'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''Morover, in human society it is of the utmost necessity that there be friendship among many people.'' This is a quotation from [[w:Thomas Aquinas|St Thomas Aquinas]], ''[[w:Summa contra Gentiles|Summa Contra Gentiles]]'', Book 3, Chapter 125, ''That Matrimony Should Not Take Place Between Close Relatives'', Paragraph 6.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.josephkenny.joyeurs.com/CDtexts/ContraGentiles3b.htm#125 ''Summa Contra Gentiles'' 3:125:6.].&lt;br&gt;Both Gifford (1988) 237 and Thornton (1968) 198-199 failed to locate the source of this quotation.&lt;/ref&gt;


'''''Ora pro nobis'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''Pray for us.''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 237.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 199.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase occurs commonly in Catholic prayers and rituals, especially the [[w:Litany of the Saints|Litany of the Saints]].


'''''Pogue mahone! Acushla machree!'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Hiberno-English'') ''Kiss my arse! My Sweetheart!''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 237.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 199.&lt;/ref&gt; The first expression is an Anglicisation of the Irish ''Póg mo thóin''. The second expression is a term of endearment from the Irish ''A chuisle mo chroí'' (''O pulse of my heart''). See also [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Scylla_and_Charybdis/179|179.07]], which quotes from John Philpott Curran's song ''Cushla-ma-Chree''.


'''''Requiescat'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''May she rest.''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen curtails the common [[w:Rest in peace|prayer for the repose of the dead]]: ''Requiescat in pace'' (''May she rest in peace'').

See also [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Hades/100|100.24]], where the prayer occurs in Paddy dignam's burial rite.

Dante was thirty-five in 1300, the year in which the ''[[w:Divine Comedy|Divine Comedy]]'' is set. Seventy years is the traditional lifespan allotted to mankind ([[s:Bible_(King_James)/Psalms#Psalm_90|Psalms 90:10]]).

'''''Amplius. Adhuc. Iterum. Postea.'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''Moreover. Furthermore. Again. Next.''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 241.&lt;/ref&gt; These are technical or rhetorical terms used by [[w:Scholasticism|scholastic]] debaters to introduce the different points of their arguments. In this context, they all mean much the same thing and are variously translated in modern editions as ''again, furthermore, moreover, besides, then, next''. The first two occur repeatedly in the works of [[w:Thomas Aquinas|Thomas Aquinas]]; he does not use ''[[wikt:iterum|Iterum]]'', but ''[[wikt:item|Item]]'' (''likewise, similarly, also'') does occur frequently. Instead of ''[[wikt:postea|Postea]]'' (''next, then'') he prefers ''[[wikt:praeterea|Praeterea]]'' (''besides, moreover''). Considering the role Aquinas plays in Stephen's thought, it is possible that he (or Joyce) has misremembered, substituting ''Iterum. Postea'' for ''Item. Praeterea.''

'''''Piano, diminuendo'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''Softly, with gradually diminishing volume''. These are common [[w:Glossary of musical terminology|musical terms]].


'''''A tempo'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''at the original tempo'' (i.e. ''speed''). This [[w:Glossary of musical terminology|musical direction]] is generally used after a change of tempo (e.g. ''accelerando'') to indicate that the performer should resume the original tempo. Here, however, there has been no change of tempo — in fact, no tempo has been specified.


'''''Stringendo'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''with gradually increasing intensity''. This [[w:Glossary of musical terminology|musical direction]] is often loosely equated with ''accelerando'' (''gradually getting faster''), but its meaning is broader. While it is true that the tempo is usually increased, so too are the volume and intensity of expression. Here, Stephen is becoming more and more excited.

'''''Autontimerumenos'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Greek'') ''Self-Tormentor''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 244-245.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 207-208.&lt;/ref&gt; The correct expression is ''[[w:Heauton Timorumenos|Heauton Timorumenos]]'', which is the title of a play by the Latin playwright [[w:Terence|Terence]], after a Greek original of the same name by [[w:Menander|Menander]] (of which only fragments survive). There may also be an allusion to [[w:Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire's]] poem ''L'Héautontimorouménos'' in the second edition of his collection ''[[w:Les Fleurs du mal|Les Fleurs du mal]]'' (''The Flowers of Evil'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://baudelaire.litteratura.com/les_fleurs_du_mal.php?rub=oeuvre&amp;srub=pov&amp;id=94#.UJfY8YYnSkg ''Les Fleurs du mal'', &quot;L'Héautontimorouménos&quot;.]&lt;/ref&gt;


'''''Bous Stephanoumenos'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Greek'') ''Garlanded Bull''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 245.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 208.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[w:A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man|A Portrait of the Artist as a Young man]]'' Stephen's school-mates call to him: ''Bous Stephanoumenos! Bous Stephaneforos!'' (''Crowned Bull! Garland-bearing Bull!''). Stephen's name is derived from the Greek ''stephanos'' ([[wikt:στέφανος|στέφανος]]), which means ''crown'', ''garland'', ''wreath'', ''crown of victory'', ''prize''. It has been suggested that Stephen sees himself as the sacrificial beast, garlanded in preparation for the sacrificial rites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ste%2Ffanoumenos&amp;la=greek#lexicon Perseus Greek Lexicon.]&lt;br&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/stable/25486759 Stuart Curran, ''Bous Stephanoumenos: Joyce's Sacred Cow'', ''James Joyce Quarterly'', Volume 6, Number 2 (University of Tulsa, Winter, 1969), pp. 163-170.]&lt;/ref&gt;


'''S. D : sua donna. ''Già : di lui. Gelindo risolve di non amar S. D.'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''S. D: his woman. Sure—his. Gelindo resolves not to love S. D.''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 245.&lt;/ref&gt; The source of this epigram is unknown. ''Gelindo'' is an Italian personal name; it is possible that Stephen associates the name with the Italian ''[[wikt:gelido|gelido]]'' (''cold'', ''gelid''). ''S. D.'', of course, are also Stephen Dedalus's (and Simon Dedalus's) initials. In ''[[w:A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man|A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'', Stephen writes in his journal: ''Turned off that valve at once and opened the spiritual-heroic refrigerating apparatus, invented and patented in all countries by Dante Alighieri''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4217 James Joyce, ''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'' (1916) 252.]&lt;/ref&gt;


'''sua donna ... ''amar'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Errata'') The words ''sua donna'' should be in italics. ''amar'' is the [[wikt:amar|apocopic form]] of ''amare'' (''to love''), so there is no need to correct it, but in some editions of ''Ulysses'' it is emended to ''amare''. The form ''amar'' was printed in ''The Little Review'', which published an earlier draft of this episode in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.lib.brown.edu/repository2/repoman.php?verb=render&amp;id=1299765792453127&amp;view=pageturner&amp;pageno=30 ''The Little Review'' (May 1919), Volume 6, Number 1, p.28.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pater, ait'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''Father, he cries.''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 246.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen recalls Icarus's cry to his father [[w:Daedalus|Daedalus]] as he falls into the [[w:Icarian Sea|Icarian Sea]], recounted by the Roman poet [[w:Ovid|Ovid]] in his ''[[w:Metamorphoses|Metamorphoses]]'':

The story of Icarus's fall is alluded to by Shakespeare in ''[[w:Henry VI, Part 3|Henry VI, Part 3]]'' 5:6:18-25, where [[w:Henry VI|Henry VI]] compares himself to Daedalus and his son [[w:Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales|Edward]] to Icarus.&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:The Third Part of King Henry the Sixth|Henry VI, Part 3.]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen may also be thinking of Christ crying out to his Father as he dies on the cross, Luke 23:46: ''Et clamans voce magna Iesus ait Pater in manus tuas commendo spiritum meum et haec dicens exspiravit''. (''And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2023:46&amp;version=VULGATE Luke 23.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dumas fils (or is it Dumas père)'''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''Dumas Junior (or is it Dumas Senior)''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 249.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 212-213.&lt;/ref&gt; The reference is to the French writers [[w:Alexandre Dumas, fils|Alexandre Dumas, fils]] and his father [[w:Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas, père]]. Joyce requested that ''fils'' and ''père'' be set in italics in the errata list he compiled for the fourth impression of ''Ulysses''. This errata list was printed and bound with this impression as pages 733-736.&lt;ref&gt;James Joyce, ''Ulysses'', Shakespeare &amp; Company, Paris (1924).&lt;/ref&gt;


'''Hamlet ''père'' and Hamlet ''fils'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''Hamlet Senior and Hamlet Junior''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 250.&lt;/ref&gt; The former is the ghost in Shakespeare's play, the latter is the eponymous hero. Stephen has taken up John Eglinton's allusion to the two Dumas.

'''''Eureka!'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Anglicized Greek'') ''I've got it!''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 251.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 214.&lt;/ref&gt; [[w:Archimedes|Archimedes]] is alleged to have cried ''[[w:Eureka (word)|εὕρηκα]]'' (''I have found'') when he discovered the [[w:Archimedes' principle|principle]] that bears his name.


'''''Egomen'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Greek'') ''I, on the one hand''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 251-252.&lt;/ref&gt; In Greek, ''ἐγώ'' (''egō'') means ''I'', while ''μέν ...δέ'' (''men ... de'') are conjunctions that are used to convey the idea ''on the one hand ... on the other hand''. But ''μέν'' is sometimes used to emphasize a single word such as ''ἐγώ''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Primer of Greek Grammar |last=Abbott |first=Evelyn |coauthors=E. D. Mansfield |year=1987 |publisher=Duckworth |location=London |isbn=0-7156-1258-1 |page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that Stephen means ''ἐγώ μήν'' (''egō mēn''), which would mean: ''I, surely''. In either case, the ''men'' particle would not be attached to the ''egō''.

Gifford believes that Joyce is also punning on the title of the London literary journal ''[[w:The Egoist (periodical)|The Egoist]]'', which serialized ''[[w:A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man|A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' and three-and-a-half episodes of ''Ulysses''. By supporting his work, ''The Egoist'' helped Joyce to believe in himself. The ''Other chap'', who is undermining Joyce's self-belief, would then be [[w:George Roberts (publisher)|George Roberts]], the reluctant publisher of ''[[w:Dubliners|Dubliners]]''.

Other scholars, rejecting the Greek hypotheses, suggest that ''Egomen'' may be a typo for the Latin ''[[wikt:egomet|Egomet]]'' (''I myself'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:BdA3TAqGGvkJ:huespedes.cica.es/aliens/iberjoyce/freethought.pdf+egomen+greek+joyce&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=ie&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShwpRflR-x79Vd-fpeBaCSDHsH5CriRrIr4u-s99tMkJX34HjO5_pd4nwKE34LeJMFTcPZ-1cLqlASLXmq5yqXPjT9IxX0SUDrJyamwnZguEnWIQSZb-Ba-dM8T768RhwmhhMh_&amp;sig=AHIEtbRyeXyv__bJD_fuIetTP56aVRJoAw Gert Lernout, ''A Horrible Example of Free Thought: God in Stephen's Ulysses''.]&lt;/ref&gt; This could mean Stephen, himself; or it could be a reference to the God of Moses, who identifies himself with the words: ''Ego sum qui sum'' (''I am that I am'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%203&amp;version=VULGATE Exodus 3:14.]&lt;/ref&gt; This would imply that the ''Other chap'' is Satan.

''Egomen'' is a legitimate word of Greek origin, defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as: ''A monastic functionary in the Greek Church.''

'''''Summa contra Gentiles'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''Comprehensive Treatise Against the Unbelievers''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 252.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 215.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the usual title of a work by [[w:Thomas Aquinas|St Thomas Aquinas]] also known as ''Liber de Veritate Catholicae Fidei Contra Errores Infidelium'' (''Book on the Truth of the Catholic Faith Against the Errors of the Infidels''). Allegedly written for [[w:Raymond of Peñafort|Raymond of Peñafort]], the head of Thomas's religious order the [[w:Dominican Order|Dominicans]], it was an attempt to demonstrate the truth of Catholic theology without having recourse to so-called [[w:Revelation|revealed truths]]; the Jews and Islamic Moors of Spain were the intended audience.

Stephen quotes from this compendium at [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Scylla_and_Charybdis/197|197.08-09]].


'''''Notre ami Moore'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''Our friend Moore''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988).&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 216.&lt;/ref&gt; Thornton believes this is an allusion to the words ''Mon ami Moore'' (''My friend Moore'') used by the Irish playwright [[w:Edward Martyn|Edward Martyn]], a cousin of [[w:George Moore (novelist)|George Moore's]], when rescuing Moore from a potentially compromising situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.ca/ebooks/moorega-hail/moorega-hail-00-h-dir/moorega-hail-00-h.html George Moore, ''Hail and Farewell''.]&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase became a standing joke between the two men, and whenever Martyn was exasperated by Moore's excesses, he would shake his head in resignation and mutter, ''Mon ami Moore, mon ami Moore''.

While Gifford agrees that the phrase alludes to this remark of Edward Martyn, he cites another use as being most relevant to this passage: Mon ami Moore ''yearns to be ''le génie de l'amitié'', but unfortunately he can never be looked upon as a friend. For he suffers from ... a perennial condition of mental diarrhoea.''

'''''Vere dignum et iustum est'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''It is truly fitting and just.''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 260.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Father Conmee's pun on Paddy Dignam's surname is taken from the opening phrases of the various [[w:Preface (liturgy)|Prefaces]] that are intoned as part of the [[w:Eucharistic Prayer|Eucharistic Prayer]] in the Catholic [[w:Tridentine Mass|Tridentine Mass]]. After the introductory [[w:Responsory|response]], most prefaces continue, ''Vere dignum et iustum est, æquum et salutare, nos tibi semper et ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens æterne Deus'' (''It is truly fitting and just, right and for our salvation, always and everywhere to give Thee thanks, Lord, Holy Father, Almighty and Eternal God.'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/missale-romanum.pdf ''Missale Romanum'' 278 ff.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The words Father Conmee quotes also occur in the ''[[w:Exsultet|Exultet]]'' or ''Easter Proclamation'', which Stephen invoked at [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Proteus/050|050.04-05.]]

'''That book by the Belgian jesuit, ''Le Nombre des Élus'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''The Number of the Elect''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 263.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 223.&lt;/ref&gt; The Belgian Jesuit that Father Conmee is thinking of is Auguste Castelein SJ, author of ''Le Rigorisme, le nombre des élus et la doctrine du salut'' (''Rigorism, the Number of the Elect and the Doctrine of Salvation''), which was published in Brussels in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.org/details/lerigorismelenom00cast Auguste Castelein, ''Le Rigorisme, le nombre des élus et la doctrine du salut''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Castelein argued that the number of the [[wikt:Elect|Elect]] would be much greater than the number of the damned.


'''''eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''Ejaculation of semen within the natural female vessel.'' This is a technical definition of sexual intercourse. In his notes to his stageplay ''[[w:Exiles (play)|Exiles]]'', Joyce writes, concerning the adultery of Bertha:

{{quote|''It is certain that [Bertha's] instinct can distinguish between concessions and for her the supreme concession is what the fathers of the church call emissio seminis inter vas naturale. ''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Exiles |last=Joyce |first=James |year=1979 |publisher=Panther Books |location=London |isbn=0-586-04806-5 |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although Joyce ascribes the Latin phrase to the [[w:Church Fathers|Fathers of the Church]], the question of adultery and what precisely constituted adultery exercised the minds of many 19th-century Catholic theologians. Joyce's immediate source for the phrase may have been ''Casus de Matrimonio'' by the Jesuit priest and professor of moral theology Maurice M Matharan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Casus de Matrimonio: fere quingenti quibus applicat et per quos explicat suá Asserta moralia |last=Matharan |first=Maurice M |year=1893 |publisher=Victor Retaux et Filius |location=Paris |isbn= |page= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A heavily underlined copy of this Latin treatise was in Joyce's library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=James Joyce and Sexuality |last=Brown |first=Richard |year=1990 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-36852-9 |page= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another possible source is ''Onanisme'' by Dr Paul Garnier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Onanisme |last=Garnier |first=Paul |year=1885 |publisher= |location=Paris |isbn= }}&lt;br&gt;{{cite book |title=Consciousness of Joyce |last=Ellmann |first=Richard |year=1977 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Paris |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Garnier quotes the theologian Nardi when defining the act of [[w:Masturbation|onanism]]:

''Effusio seminis extra vas''
''per voluntarium et violentam copulae interruptionem''
''ad generationem impediendam.''
&lt;/poem&gt;
| &lt;poem&gt;
''The ejaculation of the semen outside the vagina''
''by the voluntary and violent interruption of copulation''
''in order to prevent conception.''
&lt;/poem&gt;
|}

See also [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Ithaca/687|687.28-29]] and '''687.33-34''', where the phrase recurs in English translation.


'''''Moutonner'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''To be flecked with fleecy clouds''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 264.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[wikt:moutonner|word]] is derived from ''[[wikt:mouton|mouton]]'' (''sheep'').

'''''Pater'' and ''Ave'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') On a Thursday, the prayers for [[w:None (liturgy)|None]] begin with the ''[[w:Lord's Prayer|Pater Noster]]'' (''Our Father''), followed by the ''[[w:Hail Mary|Ave Maria]]'' (''Hail Mary'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ie/books?id=6hNAAAAAcAAJ&amp;q= ''Breviarum Romanum'' 45.]&lt;br&gt;Gifford (1988) 264.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 225.&lt;/ref&gt;


'''''Deus in adiutorium'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') On Thursdays, after the ''Ave Maria'' the [[w:Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] for None continues with a short response based on Psalms 70:1 (Vulgate 69:1):

'''''Res'' in ''Beati immaculati : Principium verborum tuorum veritas : in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ tuæ'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') On Thursdays, after Psalms 70:1 the Divine Office continues with the hymn ''[[w:Rerum Deus Tenax Vigor|Rerum Deus Tenax Vigor]]''. Following this Father Conmee recites Psalms 119:129-176 (Vulgate 118). [[w:Psalm 119|Psalm 119]], the longest in the Bible, is an acrostic poem; it is divided into twenty-two stanzas, one for each of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet; each verse in a given stanza begins with that stanza's letter. In the Vulgate Latin translation, the opening words of the psalm are ''Beati immaculati'' (''Blessed are the undefiled''). The recitation of this psalm in the Divine Office for None begins with the seventeenth stanza, ''Pe''. Father Conmee has reached the final verse (160) of the twentieth stanza, ''Resh'' (''Res'' in Latin), which is quoted above: ''Principium ... tuæ'' (''Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever'').&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 264.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 225.&lt;br&gt;[http://books.google.ie/books?id=6hNAAAAAcAAJ&amp;q= ''Breviarum Romanum'' 46.]&lt;/ref&gt;


'''''Sin : Principes persecuti sunt me gratis : et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''Sin: Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word.''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 265.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 225.&lt;br&gt;[http://books.google.ie/books?id=6hNAAAAAcAAJ&amp;q= ''Breviarum Romanum'' 46.]&lt;/ref&gt; Father Conmee resumes where he left off by reading Psalms 119:161 (Vulgate 118), the opening verse of the twenty-first stanza, which is named for the Hebrew letter ''Shin'' (''Sin'' in Latin).

'''''Ma!'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''But!''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 266.&lt;/ref&gt;


'''''Anch'io ho avuto di queste idee ... quand' ero giovine come Lei. Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo è una bestia. É peccato. Perchè la sua voce ... sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via. Invece, Lei si sacrifica.'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''I too have had this idea ... when I was young like you. I am even convinced that the world is a beastly thing. It's a pity. Because your voice ... would be a source of income, you know. But instead, you sacrifice yourself''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 266.&lt;/ref&gt;


'''''Sacrifizio incruento'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''A bloodless sacrifice''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 266.&lt;/ref&gt;


'''''Speriamo... Ma, dia retta a me. Ci rifletta'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''Let us hope... But, listen to me. Think about it''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 266.&lt;/ref&gt; Gabler emends this to: ''Ma, dia: retta a me'', which makes no sense. In ''[[w:The Little Review|The Little Review]]'' ''dia'' occurred at the end of a line and was joined by a hyphen to ''retta'', which also makes no sense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.lib.brown.edu/repository2/repoman.php?verb=render&amp;id=1299766773468752&amp;view=pageturner&amp;pageno=48 ''The Little Review'', Volume 6, Number 2 (June 1919), p. 42.]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1922 text, however, is good Italian and needs no emending. Artifoni is using the third person singular imperative of [[wikt:dare|dare]] (''dia retta a me'' = ''give heed to me''); in Italian the third person singular is used as a polite form of address.


'''''Ci rifletterò'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''I'll think about it''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 266.&lt;/ref&gt;


'''''Ma, sul serio, eh?'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''But do you really mean to, eh?''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 266.&lt;/ref&gt;


'''''Eccolo... Venga a trovarmi e ci pensi. Addio, caro'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''Here it is ''[his tram]''... Come and see me and think about it. Goodbye, my dear fellow''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 266.&lt;/ref&gt;


'''''Arrivederla, maestro... E grazie'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''Goodbye, master... And thank you''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 266.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen uses the more formal ''[[wikt:arrivederla|arrivederla]]'' in place of the commoner ''[[wikt:arrivederci|arrivederci]]''.

'''''deshabillé'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Errata'') Gabler (1984) emends this to ''deshabille'', which is the form printed in ''[[w:The Little Review|The Little Review]]'' in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.lib.brown.edu/repository2/repoman.php?verb=render&amp;id=1299767580859377&amp;view=pageturner&amp;pageno=35 ''The Little Review'', Volume 6, Number 3 (July 1919), p.31.]&lt;/ref&gt; The correct French spelling is ''[[wikt:déshabillé|déshabillé]]''. Other editions of ''Ulysses'' opt for the French form.


'''''déshabillé'''''{{spaces|5}}a [[wikt:deshabille|garment]] worn when one is in a state of undress; a [[wikt:négligée|négligée]].


'''''embonpoint'''''{{spaces|5}}voluptuous [[wikt:embonpoint|plumpness]].

'''Eighth and ninth book of Moses'''{{spaces|5}}The first five books of the Bible, the [[w:Torah|Torah]], are traditionally ascribed to [[w:Moses|Moses]]. In the 18th century German pamphlets of magical spells and incantations were printed that purported to be of Mosaic origin. In 1849 several of these were collated and published in Stuttgart as Volume 6 of [[w:Johann Scheible|Johann Scheible's]] ''Bibliothek der Zauber-Geheimniss- und Offenbarungs-Bücher, etc.'' (''Library of the Books of Magical Secrets and Revelation, etc.'') under the title ''Das sechste und siebente Buch Mosis'' (''[[w:Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses|The Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses]]''). English translations appeared in the late 19th century

Two versions of ''Achtes und neuntes Buch Mosis'' (''Eighth and Ninth Books of Moses'') appeared in Germany in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Viktor Link, ''Ulysses and the Eighth and Ninth Book of Moses'', ''James Joyce Quarterly'', University of Tulsa, Volume 7, Number 3 (Spring, 1970), pp. 199-203. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/25486837 JSTOR (access required).]&lt;/ref&gt; No English translation has yet been discovered, but it is possible that Joyce used a translation as his source. Note that the German title has been mistranslated (''book of Moses'' instead of ''books of Moses''), a mistake easily made by someone familiar with the language but not fluent in it: would Joyce have made this mistake? And ''Peter Salanka'' is a misreading of ''Pater Salanka'' (''Father Salanka''), who is described in the German text as ''the prior of a famous Spanish Trappist monastery''. What's more, he did not compose the magical charm that Stephen reads out: he merely discovered it and made it available for the benefit of all mankind. These discrepancies with the German text support the hypothesis that Joyce's source was a poor English translation.


'''Secret of all Secrets'''{{spaces|5}}The subtitle of the original German version of ''The Eighth and Ninth Books of Moses'' includes the phrase: ''Geheimnis aller Geheimnisse'' (''Secret of all Secrets'').&lt;ref&gt;Viktor Link, ''Ulysses and the Eighth and Ninth Book of Moses'', ''James Joyce Quarterly'', University of Tulsa, Volume 7, Number 3 (Spring, 1970), pp. 199-203. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/25486837 JSTOR (access required).]&lt;/ref&gt;


'''Seal of King David'''{{spaces|5}}There is no mention of the [[w:Star of David|Star of David]] in the original German version of ''The Eighth and Ninth Books of Moses''.&lt;ref&gt;Viktor Link, ''Ulysses and the Eighth and Ninth Book of Moses'', ''James Joyce Quarterly'', University of Tulsa, Volume 7, Number 3 (Spring, 1970), pp. 199-203. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/25486837 JSTOR (access required).]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in another version of the text, the Star of David is depicted on the front cover.&lt;ref&gt;F. H. Masuch, ''Das Buch Jezira Achtes und neuntes Buch Moses'', Planet Verlag, Braunschweig (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;


'''How to soften chapped hands. Recipe for white wine vinegar'''{{spaces|5}}Neither of these items is included in the German versions of ''The Eighth and Ninth Books of Moses''.&lt;ref&gt;Viktor Link, ''Ulysses and the Eighth and Ninth Book of Moses'', ''James Joyce Quarterly'', University of Tulsa, Volume 7, Number 3 (Spring, 1970), pp. 199-203. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/25486837 JSTOR (access required).]&lt;/ref&gt;


'''How to win a woman's love'''{{spaces|5}}The German text of ''The Eighth and Ninth Books of Moses'' includes the following charm:&lt;ref&gt;Viktor Link, ''Ulysses and the Eighth and Ninth Book of Moses'', ''James Joyce Quarterly'', University of Tulsa, Volume 7, Number 3 (Spring, 1970), pp. 199-203. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/25486837 JSTOR (access required).]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Liebe sicher und dauernd zu gewinnen.''
&lt;/poem&gt;
| &lt;poem&gt;''Formula to win a particular woman's''
''Love surely and permanently.''
&lt;/poem&gt;
|}


'''''Se el yilo nebrakada femininum! Amor me solo! Sanktus! Amen'''''{{spaces|5}}(''[[w:Macaronic language|Macaronic]]'') ''Little heaven of blessed femininity! Love only me! Holy! Amen''??&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 277.&lt;/ref&gt; In the German text of ''The Eighth and Ninth Books of Moses'', this charm is described as a: ''Formula to win the love of a particular woman surely and permanently''.&lt;ref&gt;Viktor Link, ''Ulysses and the Eighth and Ninth Book of Moses'', ''James Joyce Quarterly'', University of Tulsa, Volume 7, Number 3 (Spring, 1970), pp. 199-203. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/25486837 JSTOR (access required).]&lt;/ref&gt; The formula differs slightly from Stephen's version: ''Sel el yilo in nebrakada Femininum! Amo me solo!'' The charm preceding this one ends with the words: ''Sanktus! Amen''. These discrepancies support the hypothesis that Joyce's source was a faulty English translation of the German text.

''Sel el yilo'' is glossed by Gifford as, possibly, a phonetic rendering of the Spanish ''Cielillo'' (''Little Heaven''). In the [[w:Romani language|Romani language]] of the Roma Gypsies ''[[wikt:jilo|jilo]]'' means ''heart'', while ''[[wikt:shero|shero]]'' means ''head''.

''Nebrakada'' is related, I presume, to the familiar magical incantation ''[[w:Abrakadabra|Abrakadabra]]'', the meaning of which is still disputed. Gifford's surmise that the word is Spanish-Arabic for ''blessed'' seems a little far-fetched. An allusion to [[w:Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe's]] ''Eternal Feminine'' (''[[q:Goethe's Faust|Das Ewig-Weibliche]]'') from ''Faust'' may lie behind ''Nebrakada femininum''. In Latin, ''[[wikt:femininum|femininum]]'' is an adjective, meaning ''feminine'' or ''female''.


'''Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter Salanka to all true believers divulged'''{{spaces|5}}The German text of ''The Eighth and Ninth Books of Moses'' includes a chapter called ''The Charms of St Ignatius'', the full title of which is:&lt;ref&gt;Viktor Link, ''Ulysses and the Eighth and Ninth Book of Moses'', ''James Joyce Quarterly'', University of Tulsa, Volume 7, Number 3 (Spring, 1970), pp. 199-203. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/25486837 JSTOR (access required).]&lt;/ref&gt;

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;

'''''idée fixe'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') obsession; fixed idea.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 281.&lt;/ref&gt; This French term was first coined by the composer [[w:Hector Berlioz|Hector Berlioz]] to describe a recurring musical motif in his ''Symphonie fantastique'' that represents the artist's obsessive love for his beloved. In 1885 it was established as a quasi-technical term in psychiatry to describe a form of neurotic obsession known today as [[w:Monomania|monomania]].

'''''Coactus volui'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''Having been forced, I was willing''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 282.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase occurs in the ''[[w:digest (Roman law)|Digest]]'', the compendium of Roman law compiled by the Byzantine Emperor [[w:Justinian I|Justinian I]] in the 6th century. In ''Digest'' 4:2:21:5 a judgment of the Roman [[wikt:jurisconsult|jurisconsult]] [[w:Julius Paulus Prudentissimus|Paulus]] is cited:

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|+ '''''Digest''''' 4:2:21:5'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/stream/digestjustinian00monrgoog#page/n247/mode/1up ''Digest'' 4:2:21:5]&lt;br&gt;[http://web.upmf-grenoble.fr/Haiti/Cours/Ak/ ''Iustiniani Digesta'']&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/noinclude&gt;
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
| &lt;poem&gt;
''Si metu coactus adii hereditatem,''
''puto me heredem effici,''
''quia quamvis si liberum esset noluissem,''
''tamen coactus volui''
&lt;/poem&gt;
| &lt;poem&gt;
''If I have been forced by fear to accept a legacy,''
''I judge that I am made a legatee,''
''because, though I would not have been willing had it been freely offered,''
''nevertheless, having been forced, I was willing.''
&lt;/poem&gt;
|}

From the context it is clear that the meaning of the phrase is: ''Although I was forced, this does not alter the fact that I was willing.'' According to [[w:Oliver St. John Gogarty|Oliver St John Gogarty]], Joyce's principal model for Buck Mulligan, Farrell was Classically trained and fond of abstruse Latin quotations;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=As I Was Going Down Sackville Street |last=St John Gogarty |first=Oliver |year=1980 |publisher=Sphere Books Limited |location=London |pages=5-22, 269 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but why he makes this remark while frowning ''at the distant pleasance of duke's lawn'' is still a mystery. For further discussion, see R. J. Schork, ''Joyce and Justinian: U 250 and 520'' in the ''James Joyce Quarterly'', University of Tulsa, Vol. 23, No. 1 (Fall, 1985), pp. 77-80.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/stable/25476701 ''Joyce and Justinian: U 250 and 520''].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''charming ''soubrette'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Errata'') When this phrase occurred earlier in this episode at [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Wandering_Rocks/241|241.10]], [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Wandering_Rocks/220|220.17]] and [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Wandering_Rocks/223|223.27-28]], ''soubrette'' was not italicized. Gabler (1984) de-italicizes it here. See also [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Circe/502|502.16]], where the same font style is used for ''charming'' and ''soubrette''.


'''''soubrette'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') a female [[wikt:soubrette|servant]] or attendant, especially a mischievous or cheeky one in an operetta, theatrical comedy or pantomime.

'''Naminedamine'''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') Bloom's corruption of the liturgical phrase ''In nomine Domini'' (''In the name of the Lord'').&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 294.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 241.&lt;/ref&gt; During Paddy Dignam's Burial Service, Bloom had concocted the term ''Dominenamine'' ([[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Hades/100|100.01]]). Later, in this episode, he will be inspired to concoct a similar nonsense word by a line in ''The Croppy Boy'': [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Sirens/272|272.20]]. Another variant, ''nominedomine'', occurs at [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Sirens/277|277.37]].

|name=Miscellaneous points
|intro=
This section contains some general security hints for web applications.

|checklisttitle=Always remember
|checklist=
* Do '''not''' rely on Web Application Firewalls for security (however, consider using them to improve security)
* If external libraries (e.g. for database access, XML parsing) are used, always use current versions
* If you need random numbers, obtain them from a secure/cryptographic random number generator
* For every action or retrieval of data, always check access rights
* Do '''not''', under any circumstances, attempt to implement cryptographic algorithms yourself. Use high-level libraries for cryptography.
* Ensure debug output and error messages do not leak sensitive information
* Mark problematic debug output in your code (e.g. &lt;code&gt;//TODO DEBUG REMOVE&lt;/code&gt;) even if you intend to remove it after just one test
* Do not use “&lt;code&gt;eval()&lt;/code&gt;” and similar functions
** Avoid “&lt;code&gt;system()&lt;/code&gt;” and similar functions if possible
* Ensure database servers are not directly reachable from the outside
* Consider to block old browsers from using your application


|rationale=
Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) can prevent existing security holes from being abused. They will make attacking your web application significantly harder and more annoying for the attacker, increasing the probability that a non-determined attacker will move on to a different target. However, they can usually be bypassed by a determined attacker. Your actual defense is to secure your applications. The WAF is there to provide some additional protection against mistakes in doing so. '''Having a Web Application Firewall does &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; allow you to skimp on securing your applications.''' A WAF that is not precisely tuned to an application will often block legitimate requests ''and'' pass attacks through/allow bypassing. This is especially true of the often-used free Core Rule Set of mod_security.

Outdated library versions may contain security issues.

If low-quality random numbers are used, for example for the generation of password reset tokens, attackers may be able to guess the value and circumvent security measures.

Not checking access rights at every step leads to significant vulnerabilities, for example users being able to look at data for which they have no permission (e.g. membership database supposed to show a logged-in member his information – changing the ID in the URL gives information about other members due to missing check).

Cryptography is extremely complicated and mistakes are hard to avoid or discover even for cryptography experts. Secure ciphers are developed over months of work by multiple experts and reviewed by hundreds of them. Do not try to invent a secure cipher. Do not attempt to implement existing ciphers, either, mistakes can go unnoticed and make your result insecure. Use existing, reliable libraries.

Debug output and error messages can give attackers valuable information. Notably, there have been multiple instances where debug output of the following form compromised security: “Provided token 1234 was invalid, expected value 5678” (the attacker gets the correct answer which he just needs to supply in his next attempt). For production versions, displaying of error messages should usually be suppressed. Consider replacing HTTP error pages to hide even basic information like paths.

Marking any debug output that is supposed to be removed ensures that you cannot forget removing it – just search for “TODO” and “REMOVE” before release. Make it a habit to mark it always, even if you intend to remove it “immediately”. You can always get distracted and forget.

Using dynamic code via “&lt;code&gt;eval()&lt;/code&gt;” and similar functions is usually unnecessary and small mistakes tend to cause code injection issues. Therefore, these dangerous functions are to be avoided. The same is valid for “&lt;code&gt;system()&lt;/code&gt;”, however, this cannot be always avoided. If used, input to “&lt;code&gt;system()&lt;/code&gt;” has to be correctly escaped, of course — using existing shell-escape functions or a function that automatically escapes the parameters.

Keeping database servers unreachable from the outside, e.g. by binding them to 127.0.0.1 if they run on the same machine as the web application or by using firewalls with IP white lists, prevents attackers from using stolen database passwords to actually access the database.

Browsers that are no longer supported by the vendor tend to have critical security issues. They are a sign of a badly maintained client that is very prone to malware attack and they often lack security features relevant to web applications. Blocking can be done using the User-Agent header or for IE using conditional comments. Blocking outdated browsers can force clients to use a secure browser; however, it can prevent people who can’t update their browser from using the application. Unless you know that all clients should be having IE8 or newer, blocking anything newer than IE6 is not advised. Note that the Mozilla Firefox 3.6.x branch is still supported (as of September 2011), while the Firefox 4 branch is not. Obviously, intentional blocking of older browsers is mainly relevant to web applications that require very high security.

|name=File inclusion and disclosure
|intro=
If the names of files that are to be included or sent in response to a request are coming from user input (e.g. in menu systems or download scripts), attackers may be able to request files that they are not supposed to. If user-supplied names are used for inclusions, this can even lead to code execution on the server.


|checklist=
* Do not take file names for inclusions from user input, only from trusted lists or constants.
** If user input is to be used, validate it against a whitelist. Checking if the file exists or if the input matches a certain format is not sufficient.
* Avoid having scripts read and pass through files if possible.
* If you read and deliver files using user-supplied file names, thoroughly validate the file names to avoid directory traversal and similar attacks and ensure the user is allowed to read the file.
* Ensure the application runs with no more privileges than required.


|rationale=
If the attacker is able to upload a script file and get a part of the application to include it, he can execute arbitrary code. As this poses an extremely great risk, it has to be carefully avoided. Thus, only the strictest kind of verification (checking against a whitelist) is appropriate for this task.
If files are to be offered for download, simply putting them in a directory and letting the web server handle the rest is often the best choice: Not only is it faster than having a script read the file; it also avoids risky interpretation of user-supplied file names. In some cases, this is unavoidable, e.g. if a script is needed to enforce that only logged-in users can download files or to set special headers (see next section).

In that case, make sure you correctly perform the access checks that make the script-based approach necessary and that you thoroughly validate the file names to stop the attacker from downloading files he is not supposed to download. You especially need to make sure that the attacker cannot specify other files than intended, especially not outside of the intended directory, e.g. by using the “&lt;tt&gt;..&lt;/tt&gt;” pseudo-directory name. (Note that a “&lt;tt&gt;../&lt;/tt&gt;” can be encoded in many ways!)

Running the application with limited privileges (usually done by limiting the privileges of the web server or script interpreter) limits the impact of such (and other) issues.

|name=File upload vulnerabilities
|intro=
Web servers apply specific criteria (e.g. file extension) to decide how to process a file. If an application allows file uploads (e.g. for profile pictures, attached documents), ensure that the uploaded files cannot be interpreted as script files by the web server. Otherwise, the attacker may upload a script in your application’s programming language and run the arbitrary code contained therein by requesting the uploaded file.

Additionally, an attacker could upload custom HTML or JavaScript files and direct a victim to them. Since they come from a directory inside your application, this can be used to subvert the same-origin policy protection by the victim’s browser, for example to steal cookies. Some broken browsers (notably Internet Explorer) ignore the MIME type of files in some cases and detect the file type based on the file content.

|checklist=
* Avoid unnecessary file uploads 
* Ensure that files uploaded by the user cannot be interpreted as script files by the web server, e.g. by checking the file extension (or whatever means your web server uses to identify script files)
* Ensure that files cannot be uploaded to unintended directories (directory traversal)
* Try to disable script execution in the upload directory
* Ensure that the file extension matches the actual type of the file content
* If only images are to be uploaded, consider re-compressing them using a secure library to ensure they are valid
* Ensure that uploaded files are specified with the correct Content-type when delivered to the user
* Prevent users from uploading problematic file types like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SVG and executables using a whitelist of allowed file types
* Prevent users from uploading special files (e.g. .htaccess, web.config, robots.txt, crossdomain.xml, clientaccesspolicy.xml)
* Prevent users from overwriting application files
* Consider delivering uploaded files with the “Content-disposition: attachment” header

|rationale=
File upload facilities are hard to protect correctly. If they are provided to support “gimmick” functions, they may not be worth the risk.

It is crucial that the web server will not attempt to interpret the uploaded files as scripts, as this could result in arbitrary code execution. Make sure to use the same method as your web server for deciding whether a file will be interpreted as a script or not.

Directory traversal attacks could allow an attacker to overwrite application or server files. Preventing these is also necessary to ensure that disabling script execution for the upload directory is actually effective.

Disabling script execution ensures that if attackers manage to upload a script file, it will still not be executed. However, this should not be relied upon: If the application gets transferred to a different server, the setting could get lost.

Mismatched file names/extensions can be used to upload forbidden data types (e.g. HTML, XML, SVG - see below). Even if the server sets the Content-type according to the extensions, some browsers may ignore this, analyze the file contents (MIME sniffing) and parse the file as HTML.

Re-compressing images ensures that any malicious content is destroyed. However, the image processing library needs to be secure, as it is exposed to user content and could be attacked using e.g. buffer overflow exploits.

Specifying the correct Content-type when delivering the files ensures that the file will be handled correctly by most browsers. This is required for correct functionality, but also relevant for security as incorrect handling of the file could lead to MIME sniffing, resulting in security issues.

User-uploaded HTML, CSS, JavaScript and similar files can contain scripts that run in the origin of the web site and thus are allowed to access cookies or web site content. XML and SVG files are often overlooked, but can also execute scripts. This can lead to various attacks like session stealing, CSRF etc.  Executables can be dangerous to the user and should therefore be blocked. A whitelist should be used as creating a reliable and complete list of dangerous extensions is not possible. ZIP files can be dangerous for outdated browsers (notably Firefox 2.x). Note that various files are technically also ZIP files, notably documents from OpenOffice (e.g. odt, ods) and Microsoft Office 2007 and newer (e.g. docx, xlsx).

Special files like .htacces, web.config, robots.txt, crossdomain.xml and clientaccesspolicy.xml could allow attackers to change security settings (.htaccess, web.config), cause load (robots.txt) or allow cross-site scripting/cross-site request forgery attacks using plugins (crossdomain.xml and clientaccesspolicy.xml). Note that crossdomain.xml files are also valid if they appear in subdirectories.

Allowing the user to overwrite files belonging to the application can not only damage the application, but also allow other attacks, e.g. make code execution possible or enable the attacker to change critical settings.

The Content-disposition: attachment header forces browsers to save the file instead of immediately opening it, thus reducing the risk for some of the attacks. Note that this can significantly annoy the users and is not possible in all situations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Web_Application_Security_Guide/Topic|mode={{{1|full}}}
|name=SQL injection
|intro=
An SQL injection vulnerability occurs if user input included in database queries is not escaped correctly. This type of vulnerability allows attackers to change database queries, which can allow them to obtain or modify database contents.

|checklist=
* use prepared statements to access the database ''– or –''
* use stored procedures, accessed using appropriate language/library methods or prepared statements
* Always ensure the DB login used by the application has only the rights that are needed


|rationale=
Escaping input manually is error-prone and can be forgotten. With prepared statements, the correct escaping is automatically applied. This also avoids issues with different input interpretation (charset, null byte handling etc.) which can lead to hard-to-find vulnerabilities.
Using a database login with limited access rights limits the impact of successful attacks.

|name=Cross-site scripting (XSS)
|intro=
XSS vulnerabilities occur if user input included in the output of a web application is not escaped correctly. This type of vulnerability allows attackers to inject content into the web application output. This can be used to inject a false login form (reporting the input to an attacker) or malicious JavaScript code which can steal cookies and information or execute actions using the user’s permissions. XSS vulnerabilities are separated into two main categories, ''reflected'' (non-persistent) and ''persistent'' vulnerabilities.

'''Reflected XSS vulnerabilities''' include the user input only in the output directly following the request. Thus, the attacker needs the user to follow a malicious link or make a malicious POST request. The former can be done by including the link as an IFRAME; the latter can be done using JavaScript. Both vulnerabilities do require that the user visits a malicious/compromised site, but they do not necessarily require user interaction.

'''Persistent XSS vulnerabilities''' store the user input and include it later outputs (e.g. a posting in a forum). This means that the users do not need to visit a malicious/compromised site.

|checklist=
* Escape anything that is not a constant before including it in a response as close to the output as possible (i.e. right in the line containing the “echo” or “print” call)
* If not possible (e.g. when building a larger HTML block), escape when building and indicate the fact that the variable content  is pre-escaped and the expected context in the name
* Consider the context when escaping: Escaping text inside HTML is different from escaping HTML attribute values, and very different from escaping values inside CSS or JavaScript, or inside HTTP headers.
** This may mean that you need to escape for multiple contexts and/or multiple times. For example, when passing a HTML fragment as a JS constant for later includsion in the document, you need to escape for JS string inside HTML when writing the constant to the JavaScript source, then escape again for HTML when your script writes the fragment to the document. (See rationale for examples)
** The attacker must not be able to put anything where it is not supposed to be, even if you think it is not exploitable (e.g. because attempts to exploit it result in broken JavaScript).
* Explicitly set the correct character set at the beginning of the document (i.e. as early as possible) and/or in the header.
* Ensure that URLs provided by the user start with an allowed scheme (whitelisting) to avoid dangerous schemes (e.g. javascript:-URLs )
* don’t forget URLs in redirector scripts
* A [http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/content-security-policy/ Content Security Policy] may be used as an additional security measure, but is not sufficient by itself to prevent attacks.

|rationale=
Escaping data directly at the output location makes it easier to check that all outputs are escaped – each and every variable used as a parameter for an output method must either be marked as pre-escaped or be wrapped in a corresponding escape command.

Different contexts require completely different escaping rules. A “&lt;tt&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt;” character with no dangerous meaning in HTML and HTML attributes can signify the end of an URL path in CSS. See the example at the bottom for a complex but common case where HTML and JavaScript are used together and create countless opportunities for XSS. Note that many simple XSS attempts are &quot;accidentally&quot; blocked even by the wrong escaping (e.g. HTML escaping mangles quotes required for a JavaScript string injection, or newlines creating invalid JavaScript in case of injection attempts). '''Do NOT rely on this.''' The attacker may know a trick you are not thinking about. If it is possible to place anything in a place of the document structure where it is not supposed to go (e.g. outside a JavaScript string literal), it is a security issue that ''must'' be fixed. It might not be exploitable - or you may simply not be seeing the way to exploit it. Don't take that risk!

Not setting the character set may lead to guessing by the browser. Such guessing can be exploited to pass a string that seems harmless in your intended encoding, but is interpreted as a script tag in the encoding assumed by the browser. For HTML5, use &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; as the first element in the head section.

URLs can be dangerous, too. User-provided links should be checked against a scheme whitelist, as the javascript scheme is not the only dangerous one. Other schemes can trigger possibly unwanted action. If only web links are to be allowed, require the URLs to start with “&lt;tt&gt;http://&lt;/tt&gt;” or “&lt;tt&gt;https://&lt;/tt&gt;”.

A [http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/content-security-policy/ Content Security Policy] can prevent certain kinds of injection. '''Only some browsers support it; others simply ignore it.''' It is a powerful secondary defense to limit the impact of security issues, but cannot be used as the primary way to prevent XSS - the primary way to prevent XSS is correct escaping, which will not only prevent XSS, but also ensure that your page displays correctly even in the presence of uncommon input. Implementing a CSP may require significant changes to your code. Notably, you cannot include any inline JavaScript (unless you explicitly allow inline JS in your CSP - which removes most of the protection CSPs provide).

==== Complex XSS example with JS inside HTML ==== &lt;!-- Level 4 heading since parent heading may be L2 (individual article) or L3 (print version) --&gt;

Often overlooked issues include the complex interaction between HTML and JavaScript. A often-used construct is something like this:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;html5&quot;&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  var CURRENT_VALUE = 'test';
  document.getElementById(&quot;valueBox&quot;).innerHTML = CURRENT_VALUE; // INSECURE CODE - DO NOT USE.
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The content of &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;CURRENT_VALUE&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (in this example, the word ''test'') is inserted into the page source dynamically by the server according to e.g. user input or a value from a database. The second line, which actually writes the data to the document, is often part of a script included from a file. There are many different ways to perform XSS attacks against such a construct, unless proper escaping is used in every step. In our examples, the attacker wants to execute the code &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;alert(1);&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

First, if proper escaping for JavaScript is missing, the attacker can simply provide the appropriate quote symbol to terminate the string, a semicolon, his code, and then comment out the rest of the line. For example, the attacker could provide the value &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;';alert(1);//&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, resulting in the following HTML code, executing his code:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;html5&quot;&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  var CURRENT_VALUE = '';alert(1);//';
  document.getElementById(&quot;valueBox&quot;).innerHTML = CURRENT_VALUE;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Note that this will work even if the value is escaped using a HTML-escaping function like &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;htmlspecialchars()&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; if that function doesn't touch the single-quote used in this example.

Assuming the attacker cannot use the appropriate quote, because it is filtered, he can use the value &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert(1);&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Inside a regular JavaScript file, the resulting line would not immediately cause a problem (though assigning it to innerHTML would), since the following is a perfectly safe variable assignment:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var CURRENT_VALUE = '&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert(1);&lt;/script&gt;';
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Since, however, this appears in an inline script block, the HTML parser will interpret the &quot;script-end&quot; tag, resulting in a broken piece of JavaScript, followed by a second script block containing the attacker's code, some text, and a spurious script-end tag:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;html5&quot;&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  var CURRENT_VALUE = '&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert(1);&lt;/script&gt;';
  document.getElementById(&quot;valueBox&quot;).innerHTML = CURRENT_VALUE;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Or, reindented for clarity:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;html5&quot;&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  var CURRENT_VALUE = '
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;alert(1);&lt;/script&gt;
'; document.getElementById(&quot;valueBox&quot;).innerHTML = CURRENT_VALUE;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The attacker can also simply break the JavaScript by inserting a backslash at the end of the string, thus escaping the quote at the end:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var CURRENT_VALUE = 'text\';
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

A simple newline anywhere in the string will also cause a syntax error (unterminated string literal). While these attacks do not allow direct XSS in this example, they may break critical security features, render the site unusable (Denial of Service), or allow XSS if another value can be manipulated - here the attacker supplies &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;text\&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;;alert(1);'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to a variant of this construct that passes two values:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var CURRENT_VALUE1 = 'text\'; var CURRENT_VALUE2 = ';alert(1);'';
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Since the string-ending quote was escaped, the quote that is supposed to start the second string instead closes the first, turning the remaining content into JavaScript. This brings us to the statement above: '''If it is possible to place anything in a place of the document structure where it is not supposed to go (e.g. outside a JavaScript string literal), it is a security issue that ''must'' be fixed. It might not be exploitable - or you may simply not be seeing the way to exploit it. Don't take that risk!'''

These are only issues with the first line in our example. The second line directly inserts the value into the document as HTML, thus allowing XSS. To exploit this, the attacker must avoid the script end tag due to the issue mentioned above, so he uses a non-existing image with an error handler. His input &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;img src=1 onerror=alert(1)&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; results in:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;html5&quot;&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  var CURRENT_VALUE = '&lt;img src=1 onerror=alert(1)&gt;';
  document.getElementById(&quot;valueBox&quot;).innerHTML = CURRENT_VALUE;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The innerHTML assignment puts the image tag into the document, and since &quot;1&quot; is not a valid URL, the error handler is executed. Note that this is not perfectly valid HTML, since the quotes around the attributes are missing. It is still valid enough to work, and avoids the quotes being mangled due to escaping.

Simply HTML escaping output value using functions like &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;htmlspecialchars()&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; on the server side (when writing it to the variable assignment line) will prevent ''some'' of these attacks and might make others unexploitable or harder to exploit. However, '''it is incorrect and dangerous''' and will leave other means of attack!

Most notably, the attacker might decide to do what you should have done, and properly escape his attack sequence for you. This will leave the backslash &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;\&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; as the only special character, giving an input like &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;\u003Cimg src=1 onerror=alert(1)\u003E&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (note that any remaining character, i.e. the spaces, braces, equals signs and letters could also be escaped). This will be unharmed by your escape function, resulting in the following code:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;html5&quot;&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  var CURRENT_VALUE = '\u003Cimg src=1 onerror=alert(1)\u003E';
  document.getElementById(&quot;valueBox&quot;).innerHTML = CURRENT_VALUE;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The JavaScript parser will interpret the escape sequeces and insert the XSS code into your document.


There are two correct ways to escape in this situation:

* Method 1 - JS escaping server side, HTML escaping client side (recommended)
** On the server, ''properly'' (see below) escape the value using JavaScript escape values.
** In the client-side JavaScript, ensure your code escapes the text before inserting it into the document, using e.g. the [http://api.jquery.com/text/#text2 .text() setter] of jQuery.

* Method 2 - JS escaping server side, HTML escaping client side (not recommended)
** On the server, first escape the value for HTML
** On the server, then ''properly'' (see below) escape the value using JavaScript escape values before inserting it into the document.

Method 2 allows you to deliver server-generated custom HTML to the client. You need to escape the HTML like any other HTML output (e.g. using &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;htmlspecialchars&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in PHP). The escaped content gets then passed to the client side, which directly dumps it into the document. This means the client side cannot use the text for any non-HTML context, and attempting to do so may lead to a security issue. As you can see, the escaping is done in reverse order: The format that gets interpreted last (HTML, in this case) gets escaped first, then the entire string is &quot;wrapped&quot; by escaping in the outer format.

The recommended approach is to keep text unescaped until it is ready for output, then escape right before it is output (i.e. when the context is known). Consistently following this approach will also avoid double-encoding (i.e. showing your users HTML entities like &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the text).

'''How to properly escape for JavaScript inside HTML''': Ensure that characters like &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which have no special meaning in JavaScript but do have a special meaning in HTML also get escaped. Do not write your own escaping routines, you will most likely miss something. Use existing libraries. For current versions of PHP, you may want to consider using &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;json_encode()&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; with the additional flags set:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
...
&lt;script&gt;
  var CURRENT_VALUE = &lt;?php echo json_encode($text,
        JSON_HEX_QUOT | JSON_HEX_TAG | JSON_HEX_AMP | JSON_HEX_APOS); ?&gt;;
    $(&quot;#valueBox&quot;).text(CURRENT_VALUE);
&lt;/script&gt;
...
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The text will now be correctly rendered, even if it includes weird special characters.

|name=XML and internal data escaping
|intro=
Escaping is required in internal data representations, too. For example, incorrectly escaped strings in XML could allow the attackers to close their including tag and inject arbitrary XML.

XML is a very complex format which can bear many unpleasant surprises.

|checklist=
* Avoid XML if possible.
* For XML, use well-tested, high-quality libraries, and pay close attention to the documentation. Know your library – some libraries have functions that allow you to bypass escaping without knowing it.
* If you parse (read) XML, ensure your parser does not attempt to load external references (e.g. entities and DTDs).
* For other internal representations of data, make sure correct escaping or filtering is applied. Try to use well-tested, high-quality libraries if available, even if it seems to be more difficult.
* If escaping is done manually, ensure that it handles null bytes, unexpected charsets, invalid UTF-8 characters etc. in a secure manner.


|rationale=
XML is a highly complex format with many surprising features - did you know that XML can load other content via HTTP? If you just want to store/pass a few structured values, the powerful features of XML are often unnecessary. JSON is a less complex alternative, but [[Web_Application_Security_Guide/XML,_JSON_and_general_API_security|requires its own safety measures]] (like avoiding arrays at top level and hex-encoding special characters that may be interpreted by broken browsers).

XML is too complex to “just quickly” write code that handles all possibilities correctly and safely. Do not rely on the security of “home-made” minimal libraries. Even some “official” XML libraries are known to have escaping issues in some functions or to explicitly allow content to be passed into the XML without escaping. (Notably the addChild method in PHP’s SimpleXML does partial escaping, see comments for [https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=36795 PHP bug 36795]) Libraries can contain critical issues, too. Read the documentation of your library carefully and consider searching the internet for known issues. If you are not sure, quickly test at least some basic cases.

XML has features that allow loading of external data like entities and DTDs. Some parsers enable this by default. If you parse untrusted XML files (remember, everything that comes from a user is untrusted), this may be used to read local files, make requests to internal systems not accessible from outside the firewall, and in some cases, even [http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2013-April/000127.html execute code]. See [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_%28XXE%29_Processing OWASP article] for details.

Doing escaping manually is very difficult to do correctly, as all problematic cases (e.g. partial UTF8 characters or different charsets) need to be considered. Writing a solution that works correctly with regular input may be fast and easy, but writing a solution that works correctly with any intentionally malformed input is difficult.

|name=(Un)trusted input
|intro=
All user input is to be considered untrusted. Seemingly “trusted/safe” input, like some $_SERVER variables in PHP, can be easily manipulated by attackers.

|checklist=
* Thoroughly filter/escape any untrusted content
* If the allowed character set for certain input fields is limited, check that the input is valid before using it
* If in doubt about a certain kind of data (e.g. server variable), treat it as untrusted
* If you are sure, but there is no '''real''' need to treat it as trusted, treat it as untrusted
* The request URL (e.g. in environment variables) is untrusted
* Data coming from HTTP headers is untrusted
** Referer
** X-Forwarded-For
** Cookies
** Server name (!)
* All POST and GET data is untrusted
** includes non-user-modifiable input fields like select
* All content validation is to be done server side


|rationale=
Escaping or filtering “trusted” input that should not contain any characters that require escaping will only give you a negligible performance penalty, but you will be on the safe side if the input turns out to be untrusted.

Validating input data using a character whitelist can avoid attacks using unexpected characters (null bytes, UTF-8, control characters used as delimiters in internal representations etc.). Ensure your validation is not too strict, for example you will need to allow both UTF-8 and characters like ' in person name fields.

An attacker is not constrained by the constraints a browser puts on him. Just because an input field is specified with &lt;code&gt;maxlength=20&lt;/code&gt; does not mean that an attacker cannot craft a request with 200 KB of data. The same goes for any JavaScript based constraints.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Web_Application_Security_Guide/Topic|mode={{{1|full}}}
|name=Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
|intro=
Cross-site request forgery occurs if a third-party web site causes the browser of the logged-in user to make a request to your service. With GET forms, this can be done using IFRAMEs or IMG tags. With POST forms, this is possible using a FORM element with the action attribute pointed to your site, possibly submitted using JavaScript. Both methods require no user interaction. The browser automatically submits the session cookie of the user. This can allow an attacker to trigger unwanted action with the permissions of the logged-in user.


|checklist=
* Include a hidden form field with a random token bound to the user’s session (and preferably the action to be performed), and check this token in the response
* Make sure the token is non-predictable and cannot be obtained by the attacker
** do not include it in files the attacker could load into his site using &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags
* Referer checks are not secure, but can be used as an additional measure


|rationale=
CSRF attacks allow attackers to abuse existing user sessions. The same-origin-policy of web browsers prevents the attacking web site to read the content (and thus the token) of the targeted site. As the token is bound to the session, the attacker cannot gain the token by simply visiting the web site himself. The token needs to be non-predictable (secure randomness), as otherwise the attacker could simply guess it.

Referer checks are unreliable, as some user agents do not send the header and some personal firewalls filter or falsify it for privacy reasons. Additionally the attacker can avoid sending a Referer, for example (tested with IE8 and Firefox 6) simply by setting window.location using JavaScript.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Web_Application_Security_Guide/Topic|mode={{{1|full}}}
|name=Clickjacking
|intro=
In Clickjacking attacks, the target site is embedded in an IFRAME on the attacking site and either kept in the background, but mostly covered by other elements or made transparent and kept in the foreground. The user is then incited to click a certain location (e.g. when using the transparency method by placing a button in the background). Instead of the visible button, the click hits the invisible window. The placement of the IFRAME and button is chosen so that the click triggers the action wanted by the attacker (e.g. change settings). As the user is logged into the target site, the click can trigger actions that would otherwise be unreachable for the attacker. Multiple Facebook spam waves were generated using this method.

|checklist=
* Prevent (i)framing of your application in current browsers by including the HTTP response header “&lt;tt&gt;X-Frame-Options: deny&lt;/tt&gt;”
* Prevent (i)framing in outdated browsers by including a JavaScript frame breaker which checks for (i)framing and refuses to show the page if it is detected
* For applications with high security requirements where you expect users to use outdated browsers with JavaScript disabled, consider requiring users of older browsers to enable JavaScript


|rationale=
The X-Frame-Options header is required as JavaScript frame breakers could be ineffective in some newer browsers that allow undetectable framing. However, older, still common browsers ignore the header and thus require additional protection using classic JavaScript based frame breakers. Since (as opposed to the header method) those do not work if JavaScript is disabled, additional measures may be necessary.

|name=Insecure data transfer
|intro=
Data transferred unencrypted can be sniffed. This can not only give an attacker valuable information, but also the content of session cookies, allowing him to hijack a session. Additionally, non-secure communication can be modified by an attacker.


|checklist=
* Use SSL/TLS (https) for any and all data transfer
* Do '''not''' start communicating via http, only redirecting to https when “needed”
* Mark cookies with the “secure” attribute
* Use the Strict-Transport-Security header where possible
* Educate users to visit the &lt;tt&gt;https://&lt;/tt&gt; URL directly
* If your web application performs HTTPS requests, make sure it verifies the certificate and host name
** Consider limiting trusted CAs if connecting to internal servers

|rationale=
Using https ensures all data transfer is encrypted and the server is authenticated. Redirects sent on unencrypted pages can be removed or modified by the attacker. Thus, the transition from plain http to https can be sabotaged, making any plain http communication before switching to https dangerous. Marking the cookies secure-only ensures they are never transferred via unencrypted connections to prevent sniffing.

The STS header ensures that after the first visit, even if users visit the &lt;tt&gt;http://&lt;/tt&gt; URL, the request is performed via secure https. This prevents attacks like the SSLstrip attack on the unencrypted redirect. Educating the user to visit the &lt;tt&gt;https://&lt;/tt&gt; URL directly provides this protection for the first request and browsers that do not support STS and thus ignore the header. This education can be supported by serving nothing or only an information page without a clickable link on port 80 to force users to enter the correct URL and remove the incentive to be lazy and omit the “&lt;tt&gt;https://&lt;/tt&gt;”.



In some web applications, the web server performs HTTPS requests (for example when fetching or pushing data to APIs or running the OpenID or OAuth protocols). HTTPS is only secure if the software initiating the connection (i.e. your web application) correctly verifies the remote certificate:
* Checks if the certificate is still valid
* Checks if the certificate is signed by a trusted CA (a list of trusted CAs is needed)
* Checks if the hostname you are connecting to matches the name in the certificate (the wrapper performing the SSL handling needs access to the host name)
Some libraries do not do this by default, making HTTPS connections insecure! Consider it suspicious if you are not required to provide a list of trusted CAs, or it looks like the SSL wrapper does not have access to the host name you are connecting to. To test for this isssue, attempt to connect to a host that uses a non-expired selfsigned certificate, then attempt to connect to a host that uses a valid certificate, but use a different hostname (e.g. address the host by its IP address) than the one specified in the certificate. If either of these connections succeed, your library/configuration is insecure.

In PHP, both standard ways to perform HTTP(S) requests have issues: The cURL library doesn't check certificates by default if used with cURL below version 7.10. The Stream API always requires explicit configuration (affecting all functions using &lt;code&gt;url_fopen&lt;/code&gt;, e.g. &lt;code&gt;fopen()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;file()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;file_get_contents()&lt;/code&gt;). For cURL, set &lt;code&gt;CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CURLOPT_CAINFO&lt;/code&gt;. For the Stream API, use a stream context with the &lt;code&gt;verify_peer&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CN_match&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cafile&lt;/code&gt; [http://de2.php.net/manual/en/context.ssl.php SSL context options].

If you are connecting to internal servers, consider limiting the list of trusted CAs to the CA you are using. This reduces the risk from compromised/malicious CAs. The default CA bundles often include CAs which you may not consider trustworthy, e.g. the Chinese internet authority [[w:CNNIC|CNNIC]].

|name=Session fixation
|intro=
In a session fixation attack, an attacker creates an unauthenticated session and then tricks a user to use and authenticate the session. As soon as the user has authenticated, the attacker can then use the session, as he knows the session id.

|checklist=
* Regenerate (change) the session ID as soon as the user logs in (destroying the old session)
* Prevent the attacker from making the user use his session by accepting session IDs only from cookies, not from GET or POST parameters (PHP: php.ini setting “&lt;tt&gt;session.use_only_cookies&lt;/tt&gt;”)


|rationale=
Regenerating the ID makes the old session ID worthless to the attacker. Even if the attacker manages to fix a session, his session will never be authenticated. The second countermeasure is aimed at making it impossible to fix the session. However, XSS or similar issues with other applications on the same domain (not necessarily sub-domain!) may allow attackers to set false cookies.

* Set the “HttpOnly” attribute for session cookies 
* Generate random session IDs with secure randomness and sufficient length
* Do not leak session IDs


|rationale=
Setting the “HttpOnly” attribute on cookies prevents them from being read using JavaScript. This makes it harder to perform successful XSS attacks. Random, secure session IDs prevent the attacker from guessing a valid session ID. Ensuring that session IDs do not leak, for example in Referer information, copied links and HTML content from the site etc. makes sure that the attacker cannot obtain the session ID in this way.

|name=Truncation attacks, trimming attacks
|intro=
Truncating input can be problematic if the truncation affects comparisons (e.g. checking users against a blacklist before truncation, and then truncating the name to perform the login). SQL queries can be truncated if they exceed a certain length. This can be used to execute a query with significantly different meaning (e.g. cutting of a part of a &lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt; clause).
Strings can also be automatically trimmed (leading/trailing whitespace removed), leading to the same vulnerabilities (e.g. checking the input &quot;&lt;tt&gt;eviluser␣&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; against the blacklist, then logging in &quot;&lt;tt&gt;eviluser&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;). SQL may do such trimming automatically.



|checklist=
* Avoid truncating input. Treat overlong input as an error instead.
* If truncation is necessary, ensure to check the value after truncation and use only the truncated value
* Make sure trimming does not occur or checks are done consistently
* Introduce length checks
** care about different lengths due to encoding
* Make sure SQL treats truncated queries as errors by setting an appropriate &lt;tt&gt;SQL MODE&lt;/tt&gt;


|rationale=
Avoiding truncation makes sure no issues can arise. If truncation is applied, performing all necessary checks after the truncation and using only the truncated value is equivalent to receiving the value in truncated condition. The same rules apply for trimming. Length checks prevent unexpected truncation due to length limits. Encoding needs to be taken into account because the byte-lengths and character-lengths of a UTF-8 string may be different. Setting the SQL MODE so that truncation causes errors ensures that truncation cannot be abused to modify queries. However, the resulting errors can still cause queries to fail unexpectedly, which should be handled in a secure manner.

|name=Password security
|intro=
Most web applications use username/password combinations to manage access.

|checklisttitle=To keep password-based login mechanisms secure
|checklist=
* Do not store plain-text passwords, store only hashes
* Use a secure hashing algorithm (e.g. [[w:SHA-256|SHA-256]] as of 2011)
* Use per-user salts
* Use strengthening (i.e. multi-iteration hashing to slow down brute force attempts)
* Limit login attempts per IP (not per user account)
* Enforce reasonable, but not too strict, password policies
* If a password reset process is implemented, make sure it has adequate security. Questions like “mother’s maiden name” can often be guessed by attackers and are not sufficient.


|rationale=
Users re-use passwords for multiple services. If an attacker gains access to one server and can gain a list of passwords, he may be able to use this password to attack other services. Therefore, only password hashes may be stored. Secure hashing algorithms are easy to use in most languages and ensure the original password cannot be easily recovered and that wrong passwords are not falsely accepted.

Adding salts to the password hashes prevents the use of rainbow tables and significantly slows down brute-force attempts. Strengthening slows both off-line brute-force attacks against stolen hashes and on-line brute-force in case the rate limiting fails. However, it increases CPU load on the server and would open a vector for DDoS attacks if not prevented with login attempt limiting. A good strengthening can slow down off-line brute-force attacks down by a factor of 10000 or more.

Limiting login attempts is necessary to prevent on-line brute-force attacks and DoS via the CPU usage of the password strengthening procedure. Without a limit, an attacker can try a very large number of passwords directly against the server. Assuming 100 attempts per second, which is reasonable for a normal web server, no significant strengthening and an attacker working with multiple threads, this would result in 259,200,000 passwords tried in a single month!

Not enforcing any password policies will lead to too many users choosing “123456”, “qwerty” or “password” as their password, opening the system up for attack. Enforcing too strict password policies will force users to save passwords or write them down, generally annoy them and foster re-using the same password for all services. Furthermore, users using secure passwords not matching the policies may be forced to use passwords which are harder to remember, but not necessarily secure. A password consisting of 5 concatenated, randomly (!) chosen lowercase dictionary words is significantly more secure than an eight-character password consisting of mixed case letters, numbers and punctuation. Take this into account if you do not get a password policy to implement, but have to design your own.

If an attacker cannot obtain the password, he may try to reset it. Often, answers to password reset questions are easy to find or guess. Questions alone are no sufficient protection. Consider using a question together with e-mail verification by sending a new temporary password, for example.

|name=Comparison issues
|intro=

When comparing values, know the behaviour of your programming language. For example in PHP, &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;==&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; is a loose comparison that ignores the type and may give you unexpected behaviour. &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;===&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; is used for exact comparison. Using the wrong type of comparison can lead to security issues.



|checklisttitle=To prevent comparison issues
|checklist=
* Know comparison types in your programming language and use the correct one
* When in doubt (especially with PHP), use a strict comparison (PHP: &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;===&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot;)
* When comparing strings for equality, make sure you actually check that the strings are equal and not that one string contains the other

|rationale=
Using a too loose comparison can easily cause security issues. For example, in PHP, the following will evaluate to &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt;:
  &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;a97e8342f0&quot; == 0&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
The hex string, which could be a token or hash, is automatically parsed as an integer, and as it starts with a letter and thus cannot be parsed, the result is 0.

Accidentally checking for strings being contained instead of checking for strings being equal can allow attackers to bypass e.g. whitelist checks.

|name=PHP-specific issues
|intro=
When using the PHP language, several issues need to be considered.

|checklisttitle=When using PHP...
|checklist=
* Do not use the short form “&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;?&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;”, always use the full form “&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;?php&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;” 
* When using the nginx web server, make sure to correctly follow the '''official''' installation instructions and pay attention to the [http://wiki.nginx.org/Pitfalls#Passing_Uncontrolled_Requests_to_PHP &quot;Pitfalls&quot; page]. Beware of tutorials that often contain working but insecure configuration examples.
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;preg_replace&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; can act as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;eval()&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in certain cases. Avoid passing user input to it. If you must, correctly filter and escape it.
* Use the [http://www.hardened-php.net/suhosin/ Suhosin] (including the patch, if possible) and configure it with strict rules
** Enable &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;suhosin.executor.disable_emodifier&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
** Enable &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;suhosin.executor.disable_eval&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; if possible
** Set &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;suhosin.mail.protect&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to 2 if possible
* When updating PHP to PHP 5.4 from an older version, ensure legacy applications do not rely on magic quotes for security.

|rationale=

PHP can support shortened PHP code start tags. If the option is enabled, both &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;?php&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;?&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; alone can start a PHP code block. However, if the option is disabled, &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;?&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; will not be detected and the code will be delivered to the browser instead. This can lead to code disclosure. Using the full form ensures that the code will work correctly and won’t disclose the code if the server does not support short tags.

When using the nginx server, it is very easy to make critical configuration mistakes that allow users to pass image files to the PHP interpreter. See the [http://wiki.nginx.org/Pitfalls#Passing_Uncontrolled_Requests_to_PHP &quot;Pitfalls&quot; page] for mor information. It also provides valuable tips that will probably save you some time hunting down phantom issues, so you should read it if you use nginx.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;preg_replace&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; evaluates the replacement text as PHP code if the non-standard &quot;e&quot; modifier is given in the search RegExp. If an attacker can influence the RegExp to add this modifier and provide a custom replacement text, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;preg_replace&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; allows arbitrary code execution. Be extremely careful when using this function, use &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;preg_quote&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; ''with a correctly set delimiter parameter'' for escaping when possible. If you must accept RegExp code from the user, ensure it cannot contain the delimiter (also consider attacks using malformed UTF-8, null bytes etc.) - but if possible, avoid it completely.

[http://www.hardened-php.net/suhosin/ Suhosin] can prevent certain attacks on web applications and disable insecure functions. The patch also protects internal memory structures against certain memory corruption attacks. (Also see the [http://www.hardened-php.net/suhosin/a_feature_list.html feature list] for a complete list of features and the [http://www.hardened-php.net/suhosin/why.html official explanation why Suhosin is useful].) '''Suhosin improves your security, but like Web Application Firewalls, it does not magically make all applications secure.'''

Disabling the e modifier prevents the above-mentioned vulnerabilities in preg_replace from being used by an attacker even if an application is vulnerable. The e modifier should never be used, an application that does not work with the e modifier disabled is broken. Banning eval may break legitimate applications. Consider running Suhosin in [http://www.hardened-php.net/suhosin/configuration.html#suhosin.simulation simulation mode] first to discover (badly coded) applications that use it. Setting &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;suhosin.mail.protect&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; can prevent attacks that use your mail forms to send spam. (Again, use [http://www.hardened-php.net/suhosin/configuration.html#suhosin.simulation simulation mode] first to determine if your applications are compatible with it.)

Magic quotes have been removed in PHP 5.4. An appliction that relies on them for security will become vulnerable if the update is installed. Note that this does not mean you should not update; instead, you should fix (i.e. rewrite or delete) the application. Magic quotes are not a suitable way to escape input and in most cases will not protect against all attack vectors. An application that relies on magic quotes is probably ancient and/or written without security in mind. Simply adding code that will emulate magic quotes is a bad idea.

|name=Prefetching and Spiders
|intro=
GET requests are not supposed/expected to trigger actions/changes and are happily followed by various browser mechanisms like Prefetching or Session Restore and by crawlers. This can cause unwanted actions to be triggered completely without user interaction and without the need for an attack. 

|checklisttitle=To prevent this
|checklist=
* Use POST requests instead of GETs for anything that triggers an action 

|rationale=
GET requests can be automatically and unintentionally triggered, for example by crawlers. For example in cases of “delete” buttons, this can cause a single user with aggressive Prefetching to accidentally delete everything just by opening a listing page. POST requests are expected to trigger actions and are handled accordingly by browsers.

|name=SSL, TLS and HTTPS basics
|intro=
SSL/TLS provide encryption and authentication for HTTPS. 

|checklisttitle=For maximum security
|checklist=
* '''Follow [https://www.ssllabs.com/projects/best-practices/ SSLLabs best practices]''' including:
** Ensure SSLv2 is disabled
** Generate private keys for certificates yourself, do not let your CA do it
** Use an appropriate key length (usually 2048 bit in 2013)
** If possible, disable client-initiated renegotiation
** Consider to manually limit/set cipher suites

|rationale=
SSL is easy to do and hard to do right. SSLLabs provide good guidelines that are updated when new attacks are discovered.

The CA has no need-to-know for your private key. Depending on the cipher suite used, the private key can allow adversaries to decrypt passively eavesdropped communications. Thus, even if you trust the CA, it is better to avoid any risk. Generate a key and a CSR and provide only the CSR to the CA.

Increasing key length increases security, but also significantly increases the CPU load for connection establishment. 1024 bit keys will not be accepted by Mozilla Firefox anymore for certificates that expire after the year 2013. 2048 bit keys should be enough for all applications for quite a few years – using larger key sizes seems to be overkill. (All information based on 2013.) Note: The large CPU overhead of connection establishment can be used by (D)DoS attackers. Such DDoS attacks are harder to detect and defend against when client-initiated renegotiation is supported.

SSL/TLS supports a large set of “cipher suites”, each defining a set of cryptographic mechanisms used to secure the connection. Some of them do provide perfect forward secrecy, some do not. (Perfect forward secrecy means that if the private key becomes available to an attacker, he cannot decrypt data that was eavesdropped before he got the key). Usually, the client (browser) and server choose a cipher suite by first exchanging which suites are mutually supported, and the client’s preferred suite is then chosen. Depending on setup, the server may choose the cipher suite, ignoring the client’s preference. Most defaults are reasonably sane, but for either high-speed or high-security applications, you may want to consider restricting the supported/preferred suites to fast or high-security suites. If you want to exclude clients that do not support sufficient security (e.g. ancient “export control” limited clients), make sure to disable those cipher suites. When configuring cipher suites, carefully check the setup to make sure you do not allow “ADH” suites that do not authenticate the server! If you are unsure, keep the default, and always verify the effects of your settings!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Cyberslacking is a term which has widely been defined as employees using IT equipment and systems for non-work related purposes&lt;ref&gt;http://www.administradores.com.br/informe-se/artigos/critical-analysis-of-cyberslacking-in-organisational&lt;/ref&gt;. While cyberslacking, employees will visit news, social media, and gaming sites on company time sapping employee productivity and costing employers billions. A 2006 survey conducted by Websense, Inc. on 351 IT decision-makers in the U.S. estimated that employees spend 5.7 hours per week on personal surfing at work&lt;ref name=&quot;two&quot;&gt;http://www.securitymanagement.com/archive/library/websense_technofile0906.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Employers have found ways to limit web surfing during work hours with the intention of increasing productivity through means such as blocking websites and using key logging software. In a report conducted in 2010 by OpenDNS, companies most often blocked Facebook, MySpace, YouTube and Twitter from their employees&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibualoy.net/blog/itech/internet/170-opendns-2010-report-web-content-filtering-and-phishing&lt;/ref&gt;.

Technology is booming rapidly in all sectors of the business world. As a result, cyberslacking is not a phenomenon that exists only in the United States. In a recent survey, the British employment website MyJobGroup.co.uk reported that over 2 million UK-based workers (6% of the workforce) were spending over an hour on social networking sites&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/mr-personality/201103/can-cyber-slacking-be-good&lt;/ref&gt;. Additionally, the International Data Corp states in an article from the Better Business Bureau that 60 percent of all online purchases are completed during work hours.&lt;ref&gt;Odell, Carol (2011). Controlling Cyberslacking says Carol. http://www.bbb.org/blog/2011/07/controlling-cyberslacking/&lt;/ref&gt;

Although cyberslacking has just emerged in the past decade, slacking has existed long before the internet and recent technological breakthroughs were introduced into the workplace. Breaks have always been a staple in modern office culture in the United States. Before the personal computer was introduced, slacking meant frequent visits to the water cooler for idle chatter and gossip, taking extended lunches, or having long, personal non-work related telephone conversations&lt;ref&gt;http://businessbarbados.com/entrepreneurs/cyberslacking-in-your-workplace/&lt;/ref&gt;.

On January 4th, 2006, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg fired Edward Greenwood IX, an assistant working in a Legislative Affairs Office in Albany, for leaving up a game of Solitaire on his computer screen at work. Greenwood, who held his salaried job for 6 years, was dismissed with no severance pay and no other job offers&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/56990/city-employee-fired-after-bloomberg-catches-him-playing-computer-solitaire-at-work&lt;/ref&gt;. Mayor
Bloomberg stated, &quot;There's nothing wrong with taking a break but during the business day at your desk, that's not appropriate behavior.&quot; Greenwood told reporters that he had always finished his work in a timely fashion and he played solitaire only when there was no work left to do. He usually played the virtual card game a few times a week or during lunch breaks&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/10/nyregion/10solitaire.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

A similar case in New York occurred in March 2006, only a few months after the Bloomberg-Greenwood incident. Toquir Choudhri, a city employee of the New York's Department of Education, was fired for browsing sites like Google and lonelyplanet.com. A lawsuit filed on behalf of Choudhri concluded with Administrative Law Judge John Spooner ruling in favor of Choudhri and recommending that Choudhri should keep his job. Choudhri's defense attorney argued that there was never undone work or people waiting as a result of his client's web surfing, he was an upstanding employee, and he finished all of his assignments on time. However, the ruling was just a recommendation and whether Choudhri got his job back was up to his employer&lt;ref&gt;http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5363506&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Economic Impact of Cyberslacking ==

The economic impact of cyberslacking at work can severely impact the profitability of companies. While slacking has always been a part of office settings, the advent of the internet and personal computers has increased the accessibility and impact of slacking off at work. Salary.com recently concluded a 2008 study which found that 73% of employees spent part of their day on activities that were non-work related with 22% of employees responding that they waste up to two hours a day at work &lt;ref&gt;http://www.salary.com/Articles/ArticleDetail.asp?part=par1083&lt;/ref&gt;. With thousands of distractions just one click away and the ability to easily hide what someone is doing on a computer, it’s not hard to see how cyberslacking is growing into a productivity epidemic. Malachowski and Simonini of Salary.com report that in 2006 wasted time cost employers $544 billion &lt;ref name=&quot;eleven&quot;&gt;http://www.salary.com/sitesearch/layoutscripts/sisl_display.asp?filename=&amp;path=/destinationsearch/personal/par542_body.html&lt;/ref&gt;. With personal internet use representing 52% of this wasted time, the cost of cyberslacking can be estimated to be around $275 billion &lt;ref name=&quot;eleven&quot; /&gt;. However, lost employee productivity from cyberslacking isn’t the only financial cost associated with employees browsing the web. Cyberslacking employees take up disk space with non work related files and sometimes even create security breaches through their internet misuse. Computer viruses and other malicious programs can enter company servers because of employees accessing or downloading materials unrelated to their work. These programs can be extremely damaging, having the ability to delete information and crash computer systems. A 2006 study by Websense reported that around 7.5% of organizations’ disk space is used to store non-work related files and that security breaches cost companies an average of $127,400 a year &lt;ref name=&quot;two&quot; /&gt;. In fact, according to Todd Weiss of Computerworld, a recent Challenger Study estimates workplace productivity losses associated with fantasy football to range between $275-435 million per week in the NFL regular season &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcworld.com/article/136374/add_fantasy_football_to_list_of_top_online_timewasters.html &lt;/ref&gt;. The billion dollar problem of lost productivity from cyberslacking in the modern workplace needs to be addressed quickly as technology continues to accelerate towards continuous connectivity to the internet through devices such as cell phones, tablets, and computers.

== Benefits ==
Like a coffee or water break in the past, taking a break can be beneficial and actually improve employee production. Playing games in moderation can be a good way for employees to &quot;recharge their batteries&quot; and relieve stress &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/jobs/30career.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1322543223-3gDuvKLpsUQalHsswFFdSg&lt;/ref&gt;. It is important, however, that these breaks are viewed as privileges and treated as such. Despite that employers often fear that employees will abuse their breaks, Brent Coker of the University of Melbourne conducted a study where he found that &quot;people who surf the Internet for fun at work--within a reasonable limit of less than 20 percent of their total time in the office--are more productive by about 9 percent&lt;ref&gt;http://news.cnet.com/8301-19518_3-10211019-238.html&lt;/ref&gt;.&quot;

Employees often treat these breaks as a reward for doing a good job. Some companies have even started to reward employees with virtual tokens for completing a task. These tokens can then be used by employees in simple games of chance to win prizes&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/155284/does_gaming_at_work_improve_productivity.html&lt;/ref&gt;. This acts as an incentive for employees to do work and attempt tasks they otherwise might not.

In companies that employ results based management, playing games is acceptable as employers are only concerned about the results in this managerial structure. Therefore, as long as employees are able to complete their work satisfactorily and on time, they can engage in other activities including gaming. Although taking breaks and playing games in some systems is acceptable, it is important that the employees do not abuse the system and slack off on their work.

Gaming can also be as an educational tool for employees. Dave Gray believes that in a controlled environment they can be beneficial for the workplace. Author of ''Gamestorming,'' Mr. Gray feels that games can be used to simply complex problems and promote creative thinking in a safe environment. He believes &quot;games are simply a way to put structure around the chaos of creative work&lt;ref&gt;http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/07/in-defense-of-games-in-the-wor.html&lt;/ref&gt;.&quot; This idea does not endorse the traditional sense of gaming where workers engage in the well-known games such as minesweeper, but rather a collective game that can be used to simulate real life work problems that employees may encounter. This gaming instead can be used as a learning tool and a way to explore and try new ideas.

Gaming at the workplace has now become a major factor in recruiting new employees. Prospective workers are now very concerned with the culture of the company and seek out jobs that have a fun and enjoyable work environment. In order to attract these people, companies are incorporating things like a gaming room into their offices. At such places, the employees can play pool or video games and are able to relax and relieve their stress. These companies want their employees to enjoy coming to work because they feel that happier employees work harder and are more productive. By sacrificing a little bit of work time, companies get overall better employee payoff. These companies have higher retention rates with gaming than before while their productivity has not suffered and instead improved &lt;ref&gt;https://newsroom.goizueta.emory.edu/gnr/2011/07/01/worker-productivity-in-the-google-age/&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Legal Issues  ==
Cyberslacking can lead to legal issues for employers. Many cases have emerged where employees have sued their employers over alleged harassment that was sent electronically at work. In 1995, Chevron was sued for $2.2 million dollars by a woman over lewd remarks  sent through company email. Microsoft was also sued for a similar amount over an online sexual harassment case&lt;ref name=ninteen&gt;http://www.iacis.org/iis/2003_iis/PDFfiles/OswaltElliott-Howard.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. In a final example, Morgan Stanley was sued by a group of black employees over racist jokes that were being electronically distributed at the company. A New York district court ruled that employees had the right to sue employers over these matters, despite the fact that it was other employees who made the derogatory comments&lt;ref name=&quot;ninteen&quot; /&gt;. The Supreme Court upheld this decision, asserting that companies must take precautions to create a discrimination free environment, even on the internet. The material that is sent does not have to be directed towards a particular individual in order for a lawsuit to develop. For example, the presence of online pornography can be grounds enough for a sexual harassment case&lt;ref&gt;http://www.govconexecutive.com/2010/08/cyber-slacking-costs-employers-a-pretty-penny-says-new-study/&lt;/ref&gt;.

In addition to concerns about harassment lawsuits, there is the risk of intellectual property being lost on company computers. In 2006, three employees of Coca-Cola were arrested for unlawfully stealing trade secrets and wire fraud. The employees went through Coca-Cola files while at work and attempted to send the secret formula of Coke to PepsiCo&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,202439,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;. A similar case occurred when a Lockheed Martin analyst was emailed confidential information from the disgruntled employee of a competitor. However, the information was returned to the competitor and removed from Lockheed Martin’s computers. Cases such as these have given employers reason to be concerned about the safety of classified information. Many anti-cyberslacking systems use these arguments to advertise their product, arguing that it will reduce the risk of intellectual property being taken&lt;ref name=&quot;ninteen&quot; /&gt;.

== Surveillance and Attempts to Fight Cyberslacking ==
Computers are critical tools of productivity in 21st century offices, so employers are forced to regulate and monitor computer usage rather than restricting it. Most methods of computer surveillance focus on an employee's internet usage and attempt to either actively deny access to certain content or passively catch employees who violate computer policies. However, more pervasive methods of surveillance can read an employee's operating system signals and remotely replicate their desktop, allowing all aspects of an employee's computer use to be covertly observed&lt;ref name=&quot;twentytwo&quot;&gt;http://computer.howstuffworks.com/workplace-surveillance1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. Often, employers collect more data then they can reasonably comprehend, so network administrators will either rely on automated filters to read data for them or wait until they find a problem employee and then search their stored data. Even deleting compromising files is not enough to assure privacy, as specialized hardware can allow an employer to read hard disk surfaces for data that has been deleted in a disks file system but not overwritten&lt;ref name=&quot;twentythree&quot;&gt;http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/news/4223564&lt;/ref&gt;.  

The Orwellian powers of network administrators stem from the multimillion dollar industry of Workplace Surveillance where systems can range in price from tens to thousands of dollars&lt;ref name=&quot;twentytwo&quot; /&gt;.  Studies have shown that 78% of employers monitor their employees in some way, and that within this percentage most employers choose to monitor internet use or store employee emails&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/2001/10/18/sinrod.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. Programs such as Shadow, SpyAgent, Web Sleuth, and Silent Watch have convenient interfaces and allow for a manager to decide whether or not employees should be notified that they are being monitored&lt;ref&gt;http://download.cnet.com/MG-Shadow-computer-monitoring/3000-2092_4-10470748.html&lt;/ref&gt;. The company names evoke imagery of covert operations and all seeing security, giving employers a feeling of power and providing a first line of deterrence against cyber slackers. An employer can either choose to immediately punish employees who violate their computing policies or hold on to a paper trail of violations to use at their discretion. Firing an employee can be much easier for an employer on any grounds if they have a transcript of cyber mischief to use against them whether or not the employer even cares about cyberslacking. In addition, corporations can are more powerful than law enforcement in their ability to collect data because they do not need a warrant to monitor anything considered &quot;company property&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;twentythree&quot; /&gt;. Employers can even go as far as monitoring employee locations on modern smart phones using integrated GPS sensors to enforce work schedules and prevent slacking outside of the office.  Devices can also be set up to delete data remotely or become inoperable at the will of an administrator. Laws rarely regulate an employer's power to monitor company property. Only in Connecticut and Delaware are employees required to be notified if a device is being used to track their movements&lt;ref name=&quot;twentythree&quot; /&gt;.

== Getting Around Surveillance and Blocking Software ==
Have you ever found yourself trying to hide your screen from a person sitting next to you? This scenario is so common that devices such as privacy screens for personal computers have been made to fulfill this need. Companies such as 3M sell privacy screens for computers and cell phones. 3M states, &quot;Privacy is central to everything you do &lt;ref&gt;http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/SDP/Privacy_Filters/Solutions/One/&lt;/ref&gt;,&quot; on their website advertising privacy screens for personal devices. 3M markets a screen for a desktop computer as &quot;great for open wall cubicles and those located in high traffic areas &lt;ref&gt;http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/SDP/Privacy_Filters/Products/Catalog/Prod_Catalog/?PC_7_RJH9U5230GEMB0IGF3MOBJ3CN7000000_nid=R01ZXWWS89beDPHZW9BRL0gl&lt;/ref&gt;.&quot;

During the early 2011 uprisings across the Middle East, or what is commonly referred to as the Arab Spring, many social networking sites were blocked by the governments of many of the countries affected by the popular uprisings. In Iran, people were still accessing websites such as Facebook and Youtube which were reportedly blocked by the Iranian government. One way that people within Iran were accessing the blocked sites was by utilizing proxy servers &lt;ref&gt;http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-10267287-38.html&lt;/ref&gt;. A proxy server allows a user to access websites that would otherwise be blocked. For example, people in Iran can connect to a machine, or a server, that is outside of the country. A machine outside of the country would not be subject to the same blocking of websites as a computer within the country. The user would be able to visit blocked websites. To better understand proxy servers, consider the following situation.Dan and Bill are at a party. Dan sees a girl that he thinks is extremely attractive, but is too shy to approach her. Bill knows the girl. Dan asks Bill to talk to her for him. Bill talks to the girl and introduces her to Dan. In this example, Dan, the user, makes a request to Bill, the proxy server, and is connected to the attractive girl, the blocked website.

As with the website blocking in Iran, the blocking software utilized by employers can be circumvented by use of proxy servers. Finding a proxy server, a seemingly daunting task, is very easy. A quick Google search for proxy servers yields dozens of websites allowing access to proxy servers. As well as circumventing blocking software, using a proxy server can shield a user from some surveillance software. It is important to note that companies will still be able to see that an employee visited a proxy server. 

Smartphones are becoming a necessity to typical office workers &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/10/technology/10phone.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Many employees already have smartphones with access to any website regardless of the blocking or surveillance software on their work computers. Smartphones and other devices allow access to sites that are blocked by employers. Employees are able to use their smartphones while sitting at their desk, eating lunch, or taking a break without suspicion.

== Big Picture ==
Cyberslacking is a notable example of a fight over the balance of power between employers and employees. While employees exist who will abuse their computer access by slacking off at work for a significant amount of time, many workers will act responsibly and only take breaks after they have done their work and need to recuperate. Monitors and filters that companies set up show a complete lack of trust in employees while shifting the balance of power towards them and away from the workers who cyberslack. On the other side, using privacy screens, smartphones, and proxy servers to bypass employers' restrictions allow the balance of power to shift back towards employees. As restrictions are raised by employers, employees come up with new and creative ways to bypass them playing a continuous game of cat and mouse.

As companies increase the rate at which they monitor their employees, a &quot;culture of distrust&quot; will being to rise. Employees will feel that they are not trusted to surf the web reasonably and responsibly, causing resentment and undermining morale in the workplace. Employers will feel that their employees will abuse their computer access if there are no restrictions. This distrust employees feel gives rise to groups like [http://www.stopblocking.org/ Stop Blocking] and decreases productivity in the workplace through angering employees.

Even websites such as LinkedIn and Communicator can be distractions. Communicator is used for business functions, but can also be a great way to slack off. Although these are both work friendly social networking sites, spending too much time on them can abuse the privilege of using them. A compromise must be made between companies and employees and a level of trust must be established for these programs to be used in a responsible manner.

Cyberslacking is healthy to employee productivity and moral if done in moderation. Employees should be respectful of the fact that they are getting paid to work and should only take breaks in moderation to prevent abusing the system. Employers should be respectful to their employees and understand that it is unfair to expect employees to work long shifts without breaks. The whole cat and mouse game of workplace surveillance can be broken down into an issue of respect. By respecting each other with regards to cyberslacking, employees and employers can be more productive and create a more positive workplace environment.

This guide attempts to provide a comprehensive overview of web application security. Common web application security issues and methods how to prevent them are explained. Web server and operating system security are not covered. The guide is intended mainly for web application developers, but can also provide useful information for web application reviewers.

The [[Web Application Security Guide/Checklist|checklist]] gives a short summary containing only the individual guidelines. It is recommended to take the time and read the full version, where the guidelines are explained in detail, especially if any questions arise.

Most web application developers probably (hopefully) already know some or even most of the points mentioned in this guide. However, there will probably be something new for every developer. Remember, as a developer it is your responsibility to develop your application securely, and a single mistake may be enough to allow an attack.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This template includes all topics, passing the first parameter to them. This parameter signifies the display type. The topic page will pass that parameter to the [[Template:Web Application Security Guide/Topic|Topic template]], which will then render the requested output.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

{{high-risk|over 2500}}
This template processes a request to add the current page to the allbooks category associated with a given subject.  It isn't added unless the allbooks category page exists; this is because allbooks categories should not appear on a book main page, and if they exist they're probably hidden, but if they don't exist they're sure to be visible as a redlink.
=== Usage ===
There are three required parameters, one of which must be non-blank.
* {{((}}{subject}{{))}} &amp;mdash; The name of the subject of the associated allbooks page.
* {{((}}{origin}{{))}} &amp;mdash; The name of the previously visited subject page, ''if any'', which provided the value for {{((}}{subject}{{))}}; may be blank.
* {{((}}{diagnose}{{))}} &amp;mdash; If non-blank, diagnostic messages are provided when errors are detected, together with suggestions to fix the problem and buttons to act on the suggestions.
This template first attempts to verify the existence of the allbooks category page by checking that the transcluded content of the category page is {{tl|parsable}}.  If so, there is presumed to be no problem, and this page is added to the category.  If that test fails, expensive parser function {{((}}#ifexist:{{))}} is used to determine whether the page exists; if it exists, this page is added to the category.  However, even if added, failure of {{tl|parsable}} indicates a problem, so if {{((}}{diagnose}{{))}} is non-blank, one or another error message is generated.
=== See also ===
* {{tl|Subjects/0}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">The debate as to whether or not [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal-line_technology goal-line technology] (GLT) should be implemented in football has been raging for over a decade [1]. However, in the past few years there have been a few incidents that have added fuel to the fire. 


In 2009, during an EPL game Manchester United’s goalkeeper, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Carroll Roy Carroll], attempted to save Tottenham’s [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Mendes Pedro Mendes] goal accidentally fumbled the ball over his own line. He quickly hauled the ball back into play. Neither the referee nor assistant referee saw the goal and the games ended 0-0 [2].


More recently, during the England vs. Germany game in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup 2010 FIFA World Cup], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lampard Frank Lampard]’s goal was disallowed as neither the referee nor assistant referee had direct line of sight on the play. Fans watching the replay could clearly see the ball had in fact completely crossed the goal line [3].


Both of these incidents undoubtedly prove that there is a gap that needs to be filled in order to ensure that football is played evenly and fairly, especially now that there is so much money involved in the sport. The fact that GLT could remove any doubt that a goal was or wasn't a goal, coupled with many other factors makes a strong [[Sport Innovation/Goal-line Technology/Arguments for the introduction of goal-line technology|case for the introduction of GLT]] into Football and minimises the [[Sport Innovation/Goal-line Technology/Arguments against the introduction of goal-line technology|case against the introduction of GLT]]. 

Now that FIFA is actively investigating GLT and [[Sport Innovation/Goal-line Technology/Nine Technology Systems being tested by FIFA|testing nine different technologies]] and have set such [[Sport Innovation/Goal-line Technology/FIFA Testing Criteria for Goal-line technologies|strict criteria]], incidents such as the above, will not occur in any professional football games [4].

I have information about the poem that I would like to add, but first I'd like to check to see if there is a template that will express the line numbers (I seem to recall having seen one before).  If my hunt doesn't turn up anything, I will see if anyone in the Reading Room has a suggestion for me.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello to all! I am Master Tongue, because I am trying desperately to learn many languages before I die. My goal that I have set, orders me to break the world record for fluency in the most
languages. Through my research, I have found that that number to break is 58. If anyone has any
objections to that, please let me know.

I am also in the process of writing a fictional book, which is not posted her on Wikibooks, but
will hopefully become a best seller in a few years when I am done. As you can see, I said ''years''
because my interests chance rapidly, so only part of my life is dedicated to the book. Another
reason I am studying so many languages, is because of my rapidly changing interest for subjects.
One day I will be studying Italian, then see a movie commercial set in France, and switch to
learning French for a week or so, then hear something about Latin, and go to that. I realize this is not a healthy way to learn languages, but it works for me... for the time being... since I feel
I am gifted in learning languages.

I am currently working on a learning Hawaiian book, which will be the first in my series,
&quot;Languages for the Dedicated Learner&quot;. If anyone has any suggestions for my books, please do not 
hesitate to leave a message. I love talking to people about languages, (within limits) and could go
on and on about specific grammar in some languages! (Yeah! That's right! I'm a nerd!) And if any
native Hawaiian wants to correct me in some place, I would be more than grateful!

And one more thing: if you're thinking about changing my work, lay off! I'm working too hard on
these things for you to go around deleting things and getting rid of stuff! Haha ;)

... Ok, maybe just ignore that last paragraph. I don't particularly care if you alter it, but it's
also the place where I keep track of what I've learned, and a personal reference point for me.
So don't alter it too badly.
If you are looking for a way to learn languages fast and effectively, Master Tongue is the one
to go to!

==1. Define the following types of waterfalls and give one example of each.==

In looking at waterfalls most often there can be different types represented in various stages of the fall. So you could have a plunge in the first 200m then a section of cascade for 30m vertical but 50m horizontal then a further plunge for 30m. A great example of this is the main waterfall in Yosemite National Park. This at my last look was the worlds 3rd highest.
 
These are the full list of waterfall types with brief descriptions but for the honour you only need to do those asked.

•Block: Water descends from a relatively wide stream or river.

•Cascade: Water descends a series of rock steps.

•Cataract: A large, powerful waterfall.

•Fan: Water spreads horizontally as it descends while remaining in contact with bedrock.

•Horsetail: Descending water maintains some contact with bedrock.

•Plunge: Water descends vertically, losing contact with the bedrock surface.

•Punchbowl: Water descends in a constricted form and then spreads out in a wider pool.

•Segmented: Distinctly separate flows of water form as it descends.

•Tiered: Water drops in a series of distinct steps or falls.

•Multi-step: A series of waterfalls one after another of roughly the same size each with its own sunken plunge pool.







===a. Block===
In a block waterfall, water descends from a relatively wide stream or river.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===b. Cascade===
In a cascade waterfall, water descends a series of rock steps.

===c. Horsetail===
In a horsetail waterfall, descending water maintains some contact with bedrock.

===d. Plunge===
In a plunge waterfall, water descends vertically, losing contact with the bedrock surface.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Technical documentation ==
Each Topic (page) contains a single template. The attributes contain the entire page content. This [[Template:Web Application Security Guide/Topic|Topic template]] provides rendering in different modes, from showing only a link to showing the checklist to showing the full article. If you create a topic, follow the instructions from the topic template and update the [[Template:Web Application Security Guide/Alltopics|Alltopics template]], the [[Template:Web Application Security Guide/Navbox|Navbox]] and the [[Wikibooks:Collections/Web Application Security Guide|Collection]]. Everything else updates automatically.

The Topics can be included, passing in the rendering type as the first parameter, to show only relevant parts. The [[Template:Web Application Security Guide/Alltopics|Alltopics template]] renders all Topics in a certain rendering mode. This is used for the Checklist page and the print version. A prefix (for lists) can be given as a second parameter. This is used for the main TOC and can also be used to update the Topics part of the collection. However, this requires substitution. Until substall: is implemented, use [[Special:ExpandTemplates]]. The Navbox can be updated in the same way (possibly requiring some manual changes). The Navbox cannot use non-substed links as this would create a template loop when including the Navbox in the Topics.

Unfortunately, the Collections seem to be horribly broken.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section talks about the structure of Hawaiian, and simple things to note when learning the
language.

==&lt;u&gt;Letters&lt;/u&gt;==

In each lesson, three parts will be provided for you; a grammar section, a vocabulary section, and a review, or practice section. Be sure to go through everything carefully, then move on to the next chapter.

Hawaiian consists of h, k, l, m, n, p, w, and an 'okina, which represents a glottal stop in the voice when speaking, as in the English phrase, uh-oh. The 'okina is basically an apostrophe between two vowels and it does not have a specific sound, other than the slight stop.
The vowels are the same as in English, a, e, i, o, u, with one exception: a kahakō can be placed
over any vowel to make its length increase- expressed as a line over a vowel.

Note how ''hale'' (house) has a short ''a'', compared to ''kāne'' (man).

Another rule in Hawaiian is that consonants can not double up. That is, they can't be side by side in a word. Vowels have more freedom because they can lie next to each other, however consonants cannot. Consonants cannot end a word either (the 'okina is considered a consonant).

Note the following sounds:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Hawaiian !! Sound !! With the Kahakō
|-
| A || Ah || ā - Aah
|-
| E || Ay || ē - ayy
|-
| I || Ee || ī - Eee
|-
| O || Oh || ō - Ohh
|-
| U || Oo || ū - Ooo
|}

All of the consonants are pronounced the same as in English, except the ''w'' which is usually pronounced as a ''v''.

==Vocabulary==
In each lesson, you will be given a short list of vocabulary words to learn. These will help you in future lessons, and increase your knowledge about the language.

{|
|-
| Kāne- man || Wahine- woman
|-
| Kumu- teacher || Haumana- student
|-
| Hoaaloha- friend || Keiki- child
|-
| Pua- flower || One- sand
|-
| Maika'i- good || Ma'i- sick
|-
| Hau'oli- happy || Kaumaha- sad
|}

==Simple Sentence==

A simple Hawaiian sentence's general structure is ''adjective-noun announcer-noun/proper noun''. This is used to say ''&quot;a noun&quot;'' is ''&quot;an adjective&quot;'', as in ''Maika'i ke pua''. Litterally: Good the Flower; the flower is good.
Notice how the adjective goes to the front of the sentence, and the subject comes after it. If the subject comes first, it would make an entirely different phrase. It would not be a complete sentence, but rather, a fragment, or a part of a complete sentence. In a different sentence structure, the adjective comes after the object it describes. ex: ka pua maika'i: the good flower.
Compare the two groups of words:

{| align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
| '''Maika'i''' ka pua. || The flower is good.
|-
| Ka pua '''maika'i''' || The good flower
|}

One must be consciously aware of this switch, and organize their sentence acordingly.

In Hawaiian, pronouns are called ''Papani''. Papani, as in English are people, being I, You, We,
etc. I suppose the first, and most obvious pronouns that you should learn, would be, I, you
(singular) and he/she/it.

| He or She || 'O ia
|}

Note how '''O ia'' is two words and not one; it is ''never'' one word.

==Aia Sentences==

Most Hawaiian sentences resemble a squid, haveing three parts; the head- ''po'o'', the conector- ''piko'', and the tenticles- '''awe''. The head represents the main idea of that sentence, the conector being the subject, and the tenticles are the rest of the sentence. An ''aia'' sentene is a location sentence in Hawaiian. It describes ''when'' or ''where'' something is. These sentences are so called because they always start with the word, ''aia''. Its closest translation in English would be ''to be''. (am, is, are, etc.)

===Practice===

{| align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
| Aia au ma ke kula. || I am at (the) school.
|-
| Aia 'oe me ke keiki. || You are with the child.
|-
| Aia ke luau i kēia lā. || The luau is today.
|}

===More Pronouns===

The next pronouns that one must learn, are as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! English !! Hawaiian
|-
| we || kākou
|-
| you all || 'oukou
|-
| they || lākou
|}

Note how ''they all'' ends in ''-kou'', and ''we'' and ''they'' both end in ''-ākou''. It is important that the student make these type of conections when studying, so that the information gets permanently located in their memory. Also, all of these pronouns refer to three or more people; Hawaiian has different sets of pronouns that can be used, depending on the situation, but we will explain those later.

==Practice==

{| align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
| Nani lākou. || They are pretty.
|-
| Nui 'oukou. || You all are big.
|-
| E Kanani, ma'i kākou. || Kanani, we are sick.
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA FIFA] has announced that nine goal-line technology systems will undergo vigorous testing in a bid to be approved for match-day use in the 2012-13 EPL season. However, they will not disclose the full list of the nine candidates being assessed by the independent company Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology ( or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empa Empa] - German acronym for &quot;Eidgenössische Materialprüfungs- und Forschungsanstalt&quot;) attached to the Zurich University.


Although the complete list has not been disclosed, two of the technologies are known to be included on the list are the adidas-backed firm [[Cairos GLT System|Cairos]] and [[Goalminder]], the brainchild of Bolton Wanderers fans Harry Barnes and David Parden.


Each of the nine technologies will be tested in order to determine whether or not they meet the [[FIFA Testing Criteria for Goal-line technologies|strict testing criteria]] laid out by FIFA. Should the technologies meet the criteria they will be invited to phase two of the trials.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Although there are some standalone arguments as to why goal-line technology should be implemented the majority are rebuttals to the arguments put forward [[Sport Innovation/Arguments against the introduction of goal-line technology|against]] the introduction of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal-line_technology goal-line technology]. Below details the reasons GLT should be implemented:


The [[Sport Innovation/FIFA Testing Criteria for Goal-line technologies|criteria]] developed by FIFA to test [[Sport Innovation/Nine Technology Systems being tested by FIFA|nine different systems]]  clearly states that they must achieve a 100% accuracy in order to progress from phase to phase during the testing. Thus, inaccuracy of the technology should not be considered as a negative aspect of the technology implemented.


The thought that play will be stopped for extended periods of time or that the flow of the game will be disrupted because of the technology is incorrect. Again, the criterion used by FIFA to determine which technology to use has a strict rule concerning this. The criteria states that referees must receive an indication of whether a goal has been scored immediatly and automatically confirmed within one second via the vibration and visual signal to the referees watch.


Supporters of technology in football say goal-line incidents are the only decisions that are entirely definitive and the answer can be provided to the referee within one second of the incident occurring. The ball either crossed the line or it didn’t. The technology would not replace referees, it would help them.


With the every increasing statistics regarding sports betting, there is simply just too much money involved in the sport to have incorrect decision made. An incorrect decision could also affect the outcome of the game being played. A disallowed goal could be the confidence breaker that allows a team to be beaten. A allowed non-goal could mean a losing team getting an advantage over the other.


Although there are cases both for and against the implementation of the technology, the stronger of the two and the way sport seems to moving it towards the implementation of technology.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Over the past decade the debate as to whether or not goal-line technology should be introduced into Football has produced many compelling arguments both for and against its introduction. The majority of arguments against the introduction have stemmed from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifa FIFA] presidents [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepp_Blatter Sepp Blatter]. A summary of those arguments include: 
:•	The potential inaccuracy of the technology
:•	The difficulty in controlling the new ball
:•	The game will no longer be the same at all levels
:•	The high cost of implementing the technology
:•	It undermines the concept that the referees decision is final
:•	The human element of decision making in other areas of the game is still substantial and does not reduce the risk of inaccuracy
:•	Finally that spectators love the debate


What appears to be the primary concerns of FIFA president, Sepp Blatter, is the potential the inaccuracy of the technology, whether it can detect if the whole of the ball has crossed the line and the delay in transmitting data. There have also been complaints from players, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Seedorf Clarence Seedorf] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Ibarra Hugo Ibarra], who have tested the technology regarding the difficulty in controlling the new ball and its trajectory.


Also on the list of arguments against the introduction of GLT is ‘universality’. Those opposed to the introduction claim that it would separate the games played in the park from that played in the stadiums.  Sepp Blatterr has been quoted on several occasions saying that the game must be played in the same way no matter where in the world. Whether it’s a team of under 12s playing in a small town, they will be playing with the same rules as the professional players as seen on television.


Not all teams will be able to afford the rumoured half a million pounds to install and implement the technology. The oldest association football competition in the world, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup FA Cup], allows teams from the largest clubs in England and Wales down to amateur village teams to play. Clearly not all teams within the Cup will be able to afford the technology.


There are fears that the introduction of the technology could undermine the concept that the referee's decision is final. Some skeptics believe that players will take advantage of the technology and begin to challenge all other calls made by the referees.


Sepp Blatter has continued to argue that football must retain its human aspect. He believe that not matter which technology is applied, at the end of the day a decision will have to be made by a human being. So why remove the responsibility from the referee and give it to someone else. It is not just decisions regarding goal that could affect the outcome of a game. Referees also make decisions regarding offside players and those who foul. In recent years there have been games in which case a player has been offside or fouled and the team has gone on to score.


A final argument endorsed by FIFAs president against the introduction of GLT is that the fans love the debate. He believes long after the game will the fans continue to discuss the issue. So, as long as fans are talking about football, whether it be in a positive or negative way, it is good for the sport.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Basic Grammar=

This section talks about the structure of Hawaiian, and simple things to note when learning the
language. Hawaiian is a fairly simple language to learn, if one just applies themself, and studies every day. Some words can be a little tricky, since there are only 12 letters plus the 'okina, and ''pua'' could be pronounced, pua, pu'a, puā, or pūa. Not to be discouraging though. This language is a beautiful array of sounds and culture, and with a little practice on the grammar, you can be speaking in no time!

==Letters==


Hawaiian consists of h, k, l, m, n, p, w, and an 'okina, which represents a glottal stop in the voice when speaking, as in the English phrase, uh-oh. The 'okina is basically an apostrophe between two vowels and does not have a specific sound, other than the slight stop.
The vowels are the same as in English, a, e, i, o, u, with one exception: a kahakō can be placed
over any vowel to make its length increase- expressed as a line over a vowel.

Note how ''hale'' (house) has a short ''a'', compared to ''kāne'' (man).

Notice that ''''okina''' has an 'okina, and '''kahakō''' has a kahakō.

Another rule in Hawaiian is that consonants cannot double up. That is, they can't be side by side in a word. Vowels have more freedom because they can lie next to each other, however consonants cannot. Consonants cannot end a word either (the 'okina is considered a consonant).

Note the following sounds:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Hawaiian !! Sound !! With the Kahakō
|-
| A || Ah || ā - Aah
|-
| E || Ay || ē - ayy
|-
| I || Ee || ī - Eee
|-
| O || Oh || ō - Ohh
|-
| U || Oo || ū - Ooo
|}

''A'' makes an ''ah'' sound, as in ''father''.

''E'' makes an ''ay'' sound, as in ''play''.

''I'' makes an ''ee'' sound, as in ''bee''.

''O'' makes an ''oh'' sound, as in ''ocean''.

''U'' makes an ''oo'' sound, as in ''blue''.

All of the consonents are pronounced the same as in English, except the ''w'' which is usually pronounced as a ''v''.


===Do Not Get Confused===

There are some sets of vowels that can be a bit tricky to distinguish. For example, determining ''ao'' from ''au'', or ''ae'' from ''ai''. Study the table, and try to make the last vowel in each diphthong noticeable.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
| Ae || Ai
|-
| Ao || Au
|-
| E || Ei
|-
| Oe || Oi
|-
| O || Ou
|-
| Ou || Au
|}

==Vocabulary==
In each lesson, you will be given a short list of vocabulary words to learn. These will help you in future lessons, and increase your knowledge about the language.

{| align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
| Ke Kāne- man || Ka Wahine- woman
|-
| Ke Kumu- teacher || Ka Haumana- student
|-
| Ka Hoaaloha- friend || Ke Keiki- child
|-
| Ka Pua- flower || Ke One- sand
|-
| Ke Kula- school || Ka 'Ohana- family
|-
| Ke Ka'a- car || Ka Hale- house
|-
| Maika'i- good || Ma'i- sick
|-
| Hau'oli- happy || Kaumaha- sad
|-
| Māluhiluhi- tired || 'Olu'olu- kind
|-
| Li'ili'i- little || Nui- big
|-
| Nani- pretty || Pupuka- ugly
|}

==Nā Ka'i==

A ''ka'i'' is a lead word that helps a noun along. A noun cannot sit by itself: the noun and the &quot;noun announcer&quot; are locked together like they are married. The most common are the two, ''ka'' and ''ke'', which mean ''the'' in Hawaiian. ''Ke'' is used before any word beginning with ''k'', ''e'', ''a'', or ''o''. An easy trick to remember this is that the letters it goes with spells out &quot;ke ao&quot; which means ''the cloud'' in Hawaiian.

Another common pair of ka'i are ''he'' and ''nā''. ''He'' means ''a'' or ''an''. ''Nā'' goes along with ka and ke, meaning ''the'', but indicates the noun is plural. 


for example:

ke kāne vs. nā kāne - the man vs. the men

ka wahine vs. nā wahine - the woman vs. the women

he kāne - a man

he wahine - a woman

More ka'i include ''kēlā'' and ''kēia''; this and that, ''ko'u''; my, ''kou''; your, ''kona''; his, her, or its. These all can occur before a noun, which has to be preceded by one of these.
Be aware of the 'okina in ko'u, compared to kou. Make sure to blend the o and the u. And it does not make an ''ow'' sound, as in ''couch'', but rather the sound of a regular ''o'', with the u-sound emphasised at the end.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Word !! Use
|-
| Ke || The (before: k, e, a or o - definite article)
|-
| Ka || The (singular, definite article)
|-
| He || A or An (indefinite article)
|-
| Nā || The (plural, definite article)
|-
| Kēlā || This
|-
| Kēia || That
|-
| Ko'u || My
|-
| Kou || Your
|-
| Kona || His, Her or Its
|}

=Conversations=

I'm sure this is what you've been waiting for; how to say hello, and have a basic conversation with someone. but first, we need to learn eight very important puzzle pieces to put together.
The basic greeting is formed by saying '''Aloha''', followed by the '''time of day''', then '''how many people''' are in the conversation, ending with '''addressing the person'''.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
! Greeting !! Time !! Number
|-
|  || '''Kakahiaka''' (6:00-10:00) || 
|-
| Aloha || '''Awakea''' (10:00-2:00) || Kāua
|-
|  || ''''Auinalā''' (2:00-6:00) || Kākou
|-
|  || '''Ahiahi''' (6:00-10:00) || 
|}

Now to explain all of this. ''Aloha'' literally means ''love'', but here, it is used as a normal greeting. ''Kakahiaka'' is morning, usually said from 6:00-10:00 am, as ''awakea'' is said from 10:00-2:00 and means noontime. '''Auinalā'' is afternoon, from 2:00-6:00, and ''ahiahi'' is evening, from 6:00-10:00. Note that these times are approximate, and do not need to be followed exactly, but they are helpful guidlines when talking with a native speaker.

Kāua refers to the dual form, which is the speaker and the person spoken to. Kākou is the plural form, and refers to more than three people in the group (Greetings to all of us). Notice how Hawaiian finds it respectful to add oneself in the greeting, therefore more than three people indicates that the speaker of the greeting is talking to two people. When addressing the other person, start with ''e'' and say their name.

And of course, any of these can be left out. It is not wrong for one to only say &quot;aloha&quot;, &quot;aloha ahiahi&quot;, or even &quot;aloha kāua&quot;. Even the address to the other person may be left out, but it is good to know all of the greetings.


{|
|-
! Hawaiian !! English
|-
| Aloha kāua, e Kanani! || Hello, Kanani!
|-
| '''Aloha kakahiaka, e Niala. Pehea 'oe? || Good morning, Niala. How are you?'''
|-
| Maika'i au. A 'o 'oe, pehea 'oe? || I'm good/well. And you, how are you?
|-
| '''Ma'i au || I'm sick.'''
|}


Or if you are meeting someone for the first time, you could ask them their name:


{|
|-
| Aloha. || Greetings.
|-
| '''Aloha kāua. 'O wai kou inoa? || Hello to both of us. What is your name?'''
|-
| 'O ''&lt;u&gt;name&lt;/u&gt;'' ko'u inoa. || ''&lt;u&gt;name&lt;/u&gt;'' is my name
|}

Explanation:

'O- shows the subject of a sentence when a proper noun.

:Wai- Who

:Kou- Your

:Inoa- Name


'''''Note:''''' Keep in mind that one does not answer the question, &quot;Pehea 'oe?&quot; with how they are actually feeling. It is more appropriate to respond with &quot;Maika'i&quot;, rather than anything else. Negative words have negative power, and are looked at by the Hawaiians as people of the mainland see profanity. &quot;Everyone knows such words, and may use them in some circumstances, but they are not appropriate in ''most'' circumstances.&quot; (-Ho'olele Hualono HAW101 Podcast; Mokuna 2, Helu 1)
It is somewhat fine to find such words with close friends, or in historical writings. It is inappropriate to say them in a classroom, or in a formal setting.

::'''''Note:''''' Another little tidbit to know, would be the three words that always come together: Please, Thank you, and You're Welcome. 'Olu'olu (please), Mahalo (thank you), and He mea iki (you're welcome- or litterally: &quot;a little thing&quot;).


==Simple Sentence==

A simple Hawaiian sentence's general structure is ''adjective-noun announcer-noun/proper noun''. This is used to say ''&quot;a noun&quot;'' is ''&quot;an adjective&quot;'', as in ''Maika'i ka pua''. Literally: Good the Flower; the flower is good.
Notice how the adjective goes to the front of the sentence, and the subject comes after it. If the subject comes first, it would make an entirely different phrase. It would not be a complete sentence, but rather, a fragment, or a part of a complete sentence. In a different sentence structure, the adjective comes after the object it describes. ex: ka pua maika'i: the good flower.
Compare the two groups of words:

{| align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
| '''Maika'i''' ka pua. || The flower is good.
|-
| Ka pua '''maika'i''' || The good flower
|}

One must be consciously aware of this switch, and organize their sentence accordingly.

{|
|-
| '''Nani''' ka wahine. || The woman is pretty.
|-
| Ka wahine '''nani''' || The beautiful woman
|}

{| align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
| '''Pupuka''' ka hale. || The house is ugly.
|-
| Ka hale '''pupuka''' || The ugly house
|}

{| align=&quot;right&quot;
|-
| '''Nui''' ke keiki. || The child is big.
|-
| Ke keiki '''nui''' || The big child
|}


See the difference?

=Common Pronouns=

In Hawaiian, pronouns are called ''Papani''. Papani, as in English, are people, being I, You, He/She/It/One, We, You, They. I suppose the first, and most obvious, pronouns that you should learn would be, I, you
(singular) and he/she/it. 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! English !! Hawaiian !! Notes
|-
| I || au or wau ||
|-
| you || 'oe || Do not forget the 'okina at the beginning; it is part of the word.
|-
| he or she || 'o ia ||  '''o ia'' is two words and not one; it is ''never'' one word.
|}

==Aia Sentences==

Most Hawaiian sentences resemble a squid, having three parts; the head- ''po'o'', the connector- ''piko'', and the tenticles- '''awe''. The head represents the main idea of that sentence, the connector being the subject, and the tenticles are the rest of the sentence. An ''aia'' sentence is a location sentence in Hawaiian. It describes ''when'' or ''where'' something is. These sentences are so called because they always start with the word &quot;aia&quot;. Its closest translation in English would be ''to be''. (am, is, are, etc.)

To form an Aia sentence, first you must know what an &quot;'ami&quot; is. An 'ami is a joint word that tells one of four things;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Hawaiian !! English  !! Notes
|-
| i || to, on, in, at ||
|-
| o || of ||
|-
| ma || on, in, at  || notice that &quot;ma&quot; means the same as &quot;i&quot;, except for &quot;to&quot;. Do not get mixed up.
|-
| me || with ||
|}

''Helpful Hint: Try not to mix up &quot;ma&quot; and &quot;me&quot;. They look very much alike, so remember that ma means in, on or at, and me means with.''


===Practice===

{| align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
| '''With''' the family || '''Me''' ka 'ohana
|-
| '''to''' the school || '''I''' ke kula
|-
| '''in''' the car || '''Ma''' ke ka'a
|}


{| align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
| Aia au ma ke kula. || I am at (the) school.
|-
| Aia 'oe me ke keiki. || You are with the child.
|-
| Aia ke luau i kēia lā. || The luau is today.
|}


Try creating your own ''Aia'' sentences using the following pattern:

{| align=&quot;center&quot;
|Aia + (noun announcer) + Noun + Rest of the Sentence ('Ami + Direct Object)
|}

==More Pronouns==

The next pronouns that one must learn, are as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! English !! Hawaiian
|-
| we || kākou
|-
| you all || 'oukou
|-
| they || lākou
|}

Note how ''they all'' ends in ''-kou'', and ''we'' and ''they'' both end in ''-ākou''. It is important that the student make these type of connections when studying, so that the information gets permanently located in their memory. Also, all of these pronouns refer to three or more people; Hawaiian has different sets of pronouns that can be used, depending on the situation. We will explain those in later lessons.

===Practice===

{| align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
| Nani lākou. || They are pretty.
|-
| Nui 'oukou. || You all are big.
|-
| E Kanani, ma'i kākou. || Kanani, we are sick.
|}

== Ubiquitin ==
Ubiquitin is a highly conservative, heat-stable protein found only in eukaryotic cells. It is made up of 76 amino acids and is involved in many cellular processes. It plays a big role in regulating the cell cycle, including DNA repair, embryogenesis, the regulation of transcription, and apoptosis.
The Ub genes exist in two states: 

* The ubiquitin and ribosomal protein gene that are fused together to make translation products called Ub-ribosomal fusion proteins. 
* A polyubiquitin molecule: Ub molecules can fused together to make a linear chain of repeated Ub-molecules.
These fusion proteins can be cleaved by protein Ub-C-term hydrolase that can detach an individual UB and ribosomal protein (cleave Ub-ribosomal fusion proteins) or a set of Ub monomers (cleave polyubiquitin molecule).

[[File:UBGENE.GIF|thumbnail|The Ubiquitin System]]

=== Ubiquitin Structure ===
Ubiquitin’s protein structure is a compact β-grasp fold featuring a flexible C-terminal tail with six residues, and a core with rigid residues as seen in Figure 2a. Despite these rigid core residues, the flexible β1/ β2 loop that contains Leu8 (as seen in Figure 2b) plays a crucial role in allowing the recognition of ubiquitin by ubiquitin-binding proteins. The fact that only three conservative changes are observed from yeast to man indicates the importance of conserving ubiquitin’s structure as preserved by evolutionary pressure to resist change. This is important in facilitating the consistency of recognition of ubiquitin by ubiquitin-binding domains, also known as UBDs. 



A hydrophobic surface comprised of the residues Ile44, Leu8, Val70, and His68 (as seen in Figures 2a-c) facilitates the recognition of ubiquitin by other proteins. The different residues built into the ubiquitin structure uniquely contribute to the interactions of ubiquitin with other proteins and to ubiquitin’s many different functions. One example is Ile44 which plays an important role in cell division because it binds proteasomes and most ubiquitin-binding domains. Another example is Ile36 which serves as a mediator for interactions between ubiquitin molecules conformed as chains. This residue is recognized by and specifically interacts with ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs), deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), and HECT (Homologous to E6AP C terminus) E3s which is a type of ubiquitin ligase. Residues can also work together to perform particular functions of ubiquitin. For example, Gln2, Phe4, and Thr12 work together to facilitate cell division in yeast (as shown in Figure 2c). Also, ubiquitin’s TEK-box in higher eukaryotes which features Thr12, Thr14, Glu34, Lys6, and Lys11 plays an important role in mitotic degradation (also shown in Figure 2c). These are only few of the many structural features of ubiquitin and their roles in the many different functions of ubiquitin.


The most essential parts of the ubiquitin structure can be found in the N terminus with its seven lysine residues. These residues serves as chain assembly attachment sites in the process of ubiquitylation, a regulatory mechanism of the cell in which polymeric chains of ubiquitin are used to modify proteins and ultimately decide their fate in the cell. As in Figure 2d, these lysine residues are positioned in the three-dimensional structure in such a way that they face different directions and cover all of ubiquitin’s surfaces. The most dynamic area of ubiquitin’s structure features two particular lysine residues: Lys6 and Lys11. These regions are subject to conformational changes once ubiquitin associates with UBDs or while ubiquitin is in a chain conformation. 


=== Ubiquitin (Ub) Function ===
Ub primarily exists to regulate protein turnover by regulating degradation of specific proteins. This is a very important process in the cell. By quickly eliminating a particular regulating protein, a turn on of a gene expression can be prevented. Proteins that are to be degraded are tagged by Ub and are then recognized by another protein called 26S proteosome to be degraded. Ub depends on ATP to mark specific proteins to be degraded.
The Ub itself does not degrade proteins but slows down the rate of dissociation between proteasomes and substrate proteins.


=== The Ubiquitin- Proteasome Pathway:===
There are three types of enzymes that participate in the process: E1- Ub-activating enzymes (turn Ub into reactive state), E2- Ub conjugating enzymes (aid the linking process between Ub and substrate protein), E3- Ub ligases (work together with E2, role mainly on recognizing the substrate protein).
The general reaction pathway starts when Ub is activated by E1 in the present of ATP. After that, E2 and E3 work collaboratively to recognize the substrate protein and conjugate Ub to the substrate. From then the ubiquinated protein is ready for degradation.

[[File:UBPATH.GIF|thumb|The Ubiquitin- Proteasome Pathway]]



These three enzymes can catalyze the binding of a substrate lysine and the C terminus of ubiquitin. This leads to monoubiquitylation. When multiple lysine residues be bound, multimonoubiquitylation will occur. Ubiquitin also can form polymeric chains when the N terminus or one of the lysine residues attached to a substrate. If the chains are elongated by the same residue, this will be called homogeneous ubiquitin chain. If the chains are elongated by the mixed residues, this will be called mixed ubiquitin chain. However, only monoubiquitylation and four homogenous chain types have found that have outcomes in the cell.



=== Degradation Signals ===
Though not fully understood, there are a few theories to help understand what determines a protein will be marked by Ub
# N-degron: In 1986, Alexander Varshavsky observed that there is a correlation between the half life of a protein and its N-terminal residue. This suggested that one could predict the lifespan of the protein by its N-terminal amino acid.
# Certain amino acid sequences such as PEST signal protein degradation. The PEST sequence is rich in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine. It has been seen that removal of the PEST sequence in the protein increases protein half life.
# Mutant proteins revealing degradation signals are more prone to degradation than a normal protein. Usually the signals would be hidden away in the hydrophobic core, but sometimes mutation causes a partial folding that exposes the signal to Ub.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In 1800’s, an Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel performed breeding experiment with pea plants in his garden. He observed the visible traits (phenotype) of the plants in every generation and derived some general patterns of inheritance. Some of the traits that he observed include the flower color, the surface of the peas, and the height of the plant. By performing cross-breed among the pea plants with different phenotype, he concluded that some genes may remain hidden under another one. Now the genes that remain hidden are known as recessive genes, while the ones expressed over the other are called dominant genes. This discovery of recessive and dominant genes revealed the general rule of inheritance which is now called [[High_School_Biology/Mendelian_Inheritance|Mendelian Inheritance]].

----

'''2.3.1 Construct simple keys and use published keys for the identification of organisms.'''
:* Dichotomous Keys

'''2.3.2 Describe and evaluate methods for estimating abundance of organisms.'''

'''2.3.3 Describe and evaluate methods for estimating the biomass of trophic levels in a community.'''

'''2.3.4 Define the term diversity.'''
:* Diversity is often considered as a function of two components: the number of different species and the relative numbers of individuals of each species.

'''2.3.5 Apply Simpson’s diversity index and outline its significance.'''

:* Formula: D = N(N − 1)/ ∑ n(n − 1)

Where:
:*D = diversity index
:*N = total number of organisms of all species found
:*n = number of individuals of a particular species

:*D is a measure of species richness. A high value of D suggests a stable and ancient site, and a low value of D could suggest pollution, recent colonization or agricultural management. The index is normally used in studies of vegetation but can also be applied to comparisons of animal(or even all species) diversity.

----

'''2.4.1 Define the term biome.'''
:* A collection of ecosystems sharing similar climatic conditions; for example, tundra, tropical rainforest, desert.
:* Int: Biomes usually cross national boundaries (biomes do not stop at a border; for example, the Sahara, tundra, tropical rainforests).

'''2.4.2 Explain the distribution, structure and relative productivity of tropical rainforests, deserts, tundra and any other biome.'''

- Tropical Rainforests: 
:* High productivity
:* High precipitation (2500 mm yr¹) throughout the year
:* High insolation
:* High temperature (26 ʻC)
:* Good nutrient cycling = High rate of decomposure
:* Highest NPP

- Temperate Forests: 
:* Medium productivity
:* 4 seasons (Insolation and temperature varies)
:* Good growing season in the summer but limited in the winter
:* High temperatures and insolation in the summer = Greater productivity
:* Rainfall between 500 and 1500 mm yr¹
:* Second highest NPP

- Tundra: 
:* Low productivity
:* Lowest of precipitation (50 mm yr¹)
:* Low insolation (Days are shorter)
:* Low Temperature
:* Poor nutrient cycling because itʼs locked in the permafrost therefore low rate of decomposure
:* For 1-2 months the productivity is very high because the sun is up for almost the whole day

- Deserts: 
:* Very low productivity
:* Low precipitation (Under 250 mm yr¹)
:* High insolation, but all water is evaporated or absorbed by the ground
:* Hot days &amp; Cold nights
:* Low nutrient cycle
:* Species adapted to survive

- Grassland: 
:*Wide diversity, but low levels of productivity
:* Enough precipitation to prevent deserts forming, but not enough to support forests
:* Nutrient cycle is sufficient
:* Insolation, precipitation and evaporation rates are balanced
:* Grass can grow under the surface even in cold periods, waiting to emerge until the ground warms

'''Mooney's ''en ville'' and in Mooney's ''sur mer'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''Mooney's-in-town and in Mooney's-on-the-sea''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 297.&lt;/ref&gt; Lenehan is whimsically referring to two public houses in the city centre:&lt;ref&gt;Thoms, ''Official Directory of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland: Dublin'' (1903) pp. 1407 and 1481.&lt;br&gt;Ian Gunn &amp; Clive Hart, ''James Joyce's Dublin'' (2004) p.119.&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''J. G. Mooney &amp; Co., Wine and Spirit Merchants, 1 Lower Abbey Street.'''
:'''Gerald Mooney, Publican, 3 Eden Quay.'''

The latter is situated on one of the River Liffey's quays — hence it is ''sur mer'' — while the former is &quot;landlocked&quot;. See [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Aeolus/138|138.13]].


'''''élite'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''a [[wikt:elite|group]] of people with superior intellectual, social or economic status in society''. The members of Lenehan's ''élite'' of Erin are hardly superior to their fellow Irishmen in any of these categories.

'''''Blumenlied'''''{{spaces|5}}(''German'') ''Flower Song''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 304.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the hundreds of songs with this title, the most famous are settings of the poem ''Du Bist wie eine Blume'' (''You Are Like a Flower'') by [[w:Heinrich Heine|Heinrich Heine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umass.edu/wsp/reference/languages/german/readings/heine.html Heinrich Heine, ''Du Bist wie eine Blume''.]&lt;/ref&gt; The poem first appeared in 1825 in Heine's collection ''Das Buch der Lieder'' (''The Book of Songs''). The most celebrated setting was made by [[w:Robert Schumann|Schumann]] in 1840 in his song cycle ''Myrthen'' (''Myrtles''), Op. 25.&lt;ref&gt;[http://imslp.org/wiki/Myrthen,_Op.25_%28Schumann,_Robert%29 Robert Schumann, ''Myrthen''.]&lt;/ref&gt; The poem has also been set to music by [[w:Franz Liszt|Franz Liszt]] and [[w:Hugo Wolf|Hugo Wolf]].

One of Heine's best known poems is ''Die Lorelei'', which tells of a [[w:Siren|siren-like]] creature on the Rhine who lures sailors to their deaths with her beauty and her singing.


'''The name'''{{spaces|5}}The German ''Blumenlied'' (''Flower Song'') is a play on ''Bloom''.


'''Playing it slow'''{{spaces|5}}Schumann's ''Du Bist wie eine Blume'' has the tempo marking ''[[w:Glossary of musical terminology|Langsam]]'' (''Slow'').

'''''quis est homo :'' Mercadante'''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''Who is the man?''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 306.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 250.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Lotus_Eaters/079|079.09]]. Bloom seems to be confusing Mercadante with Rossini. Earlier, he mentioned Mercadante's ''Le sette ultime parole di Nostro Signore Gesù Cristo'' (''The Seven Last Words of Our Lord Jesus Christ'') immediately after alluding to Rossini's ''Stabat Mater''.

See also [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Sirens/278|278.29]] and [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Eumaeus/614|614.28]], where Mercadante and Meyerbeer are confused.

'''''in nomine Domini ... mea culpa'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''in the name of the Lord ... through my fault''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 307.&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll Malone's lyrics for ''The Croppy Boy'' include the following stanza, in which the Croppy Boy begins his [[w:Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|confession]]:

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|+ '''''The Croppy Boy'''''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.james-joyce-music.com/song16_lyrics.html ''The Croppy Boy'']&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/noinclude&gt;
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
| &lt;poem&gt;
''The youth has knelt to tell his sins:''
Nomine Dei'', the youth begins!''
''At ''mea culpa'' he beats his breast,''
''And in broken murmurs he speaks the rest.''
&lt;/poem&gt;
| &lt;poem&gt;
13

16
&lt;/poem&gt;
|}

The Croppy Boy would have begun the Rite of Confession by making the [[w:Sign of the Cross|Sign of the Cross]] while reciting the [[w:Trinitarian formula|Trinitarian Formula]]: ''In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti, Amen'' (''In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, Amen''). He would recite the ''[[w:Confiteor|Confiteor]]'', which includes the line, ''mea culpa, mea culpa'' (''through my fault, through my fault''), ''after'' confessing his sins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ie/books?id=T0BFAAAAcAAJ ''Rituale Romanum'' 62 ff.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Croppy Boy, then, would not have spoken the words ''Nomine Dei'', while his ''mea culpa'' would have come after the litany of his sins. Furthermore, the Latin expressions Bloom, Goulding and Pat are alleged to hear are not part of the traditional lyrics. It is possible that Ben Dollard is singing a variant text, or simply misremembering the lyrics; Zack Bowen believes that the mistake is Joyce's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Musical Allusions in the Works of James Joyce: Early Poetry through Ulysses |last=Bowen |first=Zack R. |year=1974 |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany |isbn=0-87395-248-0 |pages=196-197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is curious that the text of ''Ulysses'' has the Latin expression ''in nomine domini'' (''in the name of the Lord'') instead of ''nomine dei'' (''in God's name''), while giving the English translation of the latter. Perhaps the translation is Bloom's.


'''''corpusnomine'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') A nonsense word Bloom has concocted from ''corpus'' (''body'') and ''nomine'' (''in the name''). He has just heard Ben Dollard sing the latter; this reminds him of the expression ''Corpus Domini'' (''the Body of Our Lord''), which he heard in St Andrew's Church on Westland Row earlier in the day ([[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Lotus_Eaters/077|077.31]]); he is also reminded of the Latin he heard in the mortuary chapel in Prospect Cemetery during Paddy Dignam's Burial Service, which had prompted another of his Latin concoctions, ''Dominenamine'' ([[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Hades/100|100.01]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 307.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 251.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Sirens/246|246.16]] for an earlier variant in this episode. See also [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Sirens/266|266.18]] for a similar instance, and [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Sirens/277|277.37]] for a variation on ''dominenamine''.

'''''da capo'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''from the beginning''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 310.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[w:Glossary of musical terminology|musical term]] directs the performer to repeat a passage from the beginning. Bloom seems to be making the point that every trade has its own musical signature, which is then simply repeated ad nauseam.

== Muggles' Guide apparation ==

I hope you'll forgive my asking, but why?

The correct spelling, as seen repeatedly in the UK HP books, is appar''a''tion, to distinguish it from &quot;apparition&quot; which is equivalent to a ghost.

I don't like to revert so large a change without at least some understanding as to why it was done, and agreement on the correct course, so as to prevent an edit war. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:55, 27 November 2011 (UTC)

:Actually, having looked at the books, I will concede your point. But: I will ask you to revert your edits to that page, and ask for a quick delete of the page you created, or I can do that if you'd rather; and then I will move the page and correct the many references to it. That way we retain the edit history. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:49, 27 November 2011 (UTC)

::That would be great! Thanks.  [[User:RunningBlind|RunningBlind]] ([[User talk:RunningBlind|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RunningBlind|contribs]]) 01:06, 28 November 2011 (UTC)

:::No problem. I have reverted your edits partially (enough so we won't get redlinks on Apparition when the page gets deleted), and will move the page and correct the links once the delete is done. After you've been editing for a while, you'll automatically get Move permission as well... and also will be able to mark pages for quality. One of the advantages of having a named account.

Just a quick note -- I see you now have your reviewer tools, congratulations. I should mention that [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]], while very good at drawing out connections and coming up with deeper meanings, has an awful habit of scattering typos and fragments throughout. While I appreciate your additional eyes, I would like to suggest that the top grade not be applied to an article until you've cast a careful eye across it for grammatical errors on Raven's part, and mine -- I'm usually pretty good, but things always sneak by. I assume you know already how to use History to compare versions... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 07:05, 28 December 2011 (UTC)
:That's what I've mostly been doing and I'm pretty good at catching grammar and typos as well as having a very good knowledge of obscure details in the books to catch small mistakes.

'''''a chara'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Irish'') ''friend''. This is the vocative case of the noun ''[[wikt:cara#Irish|cara]]''.


'''the mountain gorse ''(Ulex Europeus)'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''[[w:Ulex europaeus|Ulex europaeus]]'' is the scientific name for the evergreen shrub variously known in Ireland as the [[wikt:whin|whin]], [[wikt:furze|furze]] or [[wikt:gorse|gorse]].&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 320.&lt;/ref&gt; The leaves are spiny but green, while the flowers are yellow. When they wilt, however, the leaves turn ''tawny orange'' in the words of [[w:John Betjeman|John Betjeman]] in ''Cornish Cliffs''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanjeev.net/poetry/betjeman-john/cornish-cliffs-182179.html ''Cornish Cliffs''.]&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay ''Of Usury'', Francis Bacon describes the yellow headgear worn by Jewish moneylenders as ''orange-tawny''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Essays of Francis Bacon, Edited, with Introduction and Notes by Mary Augusta Scott'', New York (1908), pp. 187-188.&lt;/ref&gt; Gorse is found throughout Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildflowersofireland.net/plant_detail.php?id_flower=109 Wildflowers of Ireland.]&lt;/ref&gt;

When identifying a species through its [[w:Binomial nomenclature|scientific name]], it is now modern usage to capitalize the genus (''Ulex'') but not the species (''europaeus'').

'''''Bi i dho husht'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Irish'') ''Be quiet''. The correct Irish form is: ''[[wikt:tost#Irish|Bí i do thost]]''. The final word is pronounced [hɔsˠt̪ˠ] (approximately: ''hawst''). The Citizen has clearly confused this with the unrelated English word ''hush'', which implies that he is by no means a fluent speaker of his native tongue.

'''tantras'''{{spaces|5}}(''Sanskrit'') A ''[[wikt:tantra|tantra]]'' is a Hindu religious text.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 329.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[w:Theosophy|Theosophy]], tantras are mystical and magical words comprising rituals associated with black magic or sorcery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.org/stream/theosophicalglos00blav#page/296/mode/1up Helen Blavatsky, ''The Theosophical Glossary'', p. 296.]&lt;/ref&gt;


'''etheric double'''{{spaces|5}}(''Theosophy'') In [[w:Theosophy|Theosophy]], the ''double'', or ''Astral Body'', is the ethereal counterpart or shadow of a man or animal's physical body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.org/stream/theosophicalglos00blav#page/35/mode/1up Helen Blavatsky, ''The Theosophical Glossary'', p. 35.]&lt;br&gt;Gifford (1988) 330.&lt;/ref&gt;


'''jivic rays'''{{spaces|5}}(''Theosophy'') In [[w:Theosophy|Theosophy]], ''jiva'' refers to Life, as the Absolute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.org/stream/theosophicalglos00blav#page/153/mode/1up Helen Blavatsky, ''The Theosophical Glossary'', p. 153.]&lt;br&gt;Gifford (1988) 330.&lt;/ref&gt; It may also refer to the Monad, the immortal part of man which is reincarnated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.org/stream/theosophicalglos00blav#page/201/mode/1up Helen Blavatsky, ''The Theosophical Glossary'', p. 201.]&lt;/ref&gt; The adjectival form ''jivic'' appears to be Joyce's own coinage.


'''prālāyā'''{{spaces|5}}(''Sanskrit'') ''dissolution''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 330.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Theosophical Glossary'', [[w:Helen Blavatsky|Helen Blavatsky]] defines '''Pralaya''' as: ''A period of obscuration or repose—planetary, cosmic or universal—the opposite of Manvantara.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.org/stream/theosophicalglos00blav#page/242/mode/1up Helen Blavatsky, ''The Theosophical Glossary'', p.242.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of [[w:Theosophy|Theosophy]], ''[[wikt:pralaya|pralaya]]'' refers to the period between death and reincarnation.

In transliterating Sanskrit terms from [[w:Devanagari transliteration|Devanagari]] to Roman script, a [[wikt:macron|macron]] is placed over a long vowel. There are no long vowels in ''pralaya''; Joyce's macrons here and below (lines 16 and 19) are whimsical.

'''tālāfānā, ālāvātār, hātākāldā, wātāklāsāt'''{{spaces|5}}''telephone, elevator, hot and cold [plumbing], water closet''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 330.&lt;/ref&gt; The whimsical spellings and [[wikt:macron|macrons]] parody the [[w:Theosophical Society|Theosophists']] predilection for Sanskrit terms. See ''prālāyā'' above.


'''Māyā'''{{spaces|5}}(''Sanskrit'') ''Illusion''. In both Hindu philosophy and Theosophy ''māyā'' refers to the idea that the physical world of sense perception is not part of true reality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.org/stream/theosophicalglos00blav#page/195/mode/1up Helen Blavatsky, ''The Theosophical Glossary'', p. 195.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case, Joyce's whimsical [[wikt:macron|macrons]] are justified, but it is probably fair to say he would have added them even if they were not.

'''''Sinn Fein ... Sinn fein amhain'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Errata'') This should read: ''Sinn féin ... Sinn féin amháin''. Gabler (1984) did not emend it, however, on the grounds that the errors were Joyce's and not typos. When an early draft of this episode was published in ''[[w:The Little Review|The Little Review]]'', it appeared exactly as it does on the page above.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.lib.brown.edu/repository2/repoman.php?verb=render&amp;id=1299770729203127&amp;view=pageturner&amp;pageno=52 ''The Little Review'', Volume 6, Number 7 (November 1919), p. 50.]&lt;/ref&gt;


'''''Sinn féin ... Sinn féin amháin!'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Irish'') ''Ourselves ... Ourselves alone!''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 333.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 269.&lt;/ref&gt; Watchword of Irish nationalists at the turn of the century. According to Gifford these words occur in the refrain of [[w:Timothy Daniel Sullivan|Timothy Daniel Sullivan's]] patriotic song ''The West's Awake'', though the only song of this name that I am aware of is by [[w:Thomas Davis (Young Irelander)|Thomas Osbourne Davis]], and it does not include these words. Thornton mentions a song called ''Sinn Fein, Sinn Fein Amhain'' by O'Higgins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Songs in the Works of James Joyce |last=Hodgart |first=Matthew |coauthors=Mabel Worthington |year=1959 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn= |page=202 |url=http://books.google.ie/books?id=RNxaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Sinn#search_anchor |accessdate=06-12-2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gladiolus Cruentus'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''[[w:gladiolus|Gladiolus cruentus]]'' is the scientific name for a flowering plant known as the blood-red gladiolus on account of the colour of its flowers. The plant is a native of South Africa. Its name could be translated as ''little blood-stained sword'', appropriate for the favourite flower of an executioner.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 335-336. Gifford calls it a fictional species, but it was identified by the British botanist [[w:Thomas Moore (botanist)|Thomas Moore]] in the 19th century.&lt;/ref&gt;

When identifying a species through its [[w:Binomial nomenclature|scientific name]], it is now modern usage to capitalize the genus (''Gladiolus'') but not the species (''cruentus''). See also [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Cyclops/284|284.13]].


'''''hoch'''''{{spaces|5}}(''German'') ''noble'', ''sublime''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 336.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[wikt:hoch|Hoch]]'' is used in German toasts and salutations. The German for ''Long live the king!'' is ''Hoch lebe der König'', while ''Hoch der Kaiser!'' means ''Up the Kaiser!''


'''''banzai'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Japanese'') ''ten thousand years''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 336.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[wikt:banzai|Banzai]]'' is used as both a battle cry and a salutation to the emperor.


'''''eljen'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Errata''). This should be spelled ''éljen''.


'''''éljen'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Hungarian'') ''long live...!''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 336.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the third perlson singular, present subjunctive indefinite of the verb ''[[wikt:él|él]]'' (''to live'').


'''''zivio'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Serbo-Croatian''). This should be spelled ''živio''.


'''''živio'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Serbo-Croatian'') ''long live...!'', ''cheers!''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 336.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the optative mood (here identical to the active past participle, masculine singular) of the verb ''[[wikt:žívjeti|žívjeti]]'' (''to live'').


'''''chinchin'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Pidgin English'') This is a traditional salutation and toast from the Far East.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 336.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[wikt:chin-chin|Chinchin]]'' is probably of Chinese origin.


'''''polla kronia'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Modern Greek'') ''many happy returns''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 336.&lt;/ref&gt; The usual form in Modern Greek is ''[[wikt:χρόνια πολλά|χρόνια πολλά]]'', so perhaps Joyce's text could be amended to: ''khrónia pollá''.


'''''hiphip'''''{{spaces|5}}(''American'') From ''[[wikt:hip hip hooray|hip hip hooray]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 336.&lt;/ref&gt;


'''''vive'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''long live...!''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 336.&lt;/ref&gt;


'''''Allah'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Arabic'') ''God''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 336.&lt;/ref&gt; As an interjection' ''Allah!'' is generally used to express surprise, not to acclaim a leader.


'''''evviva'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Italian'') ''long live...!''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 336.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Slan leat'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Errata'') This should read: ''Slán leat''.


'''''Slán leat'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Irish'') ''Goodbye''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 340.&lt;/ref&gt; In Irish the literal meaning of ''[[wikt:slán leat|slán leat]]'' is ''safety with you'', or ''may you go safely''. It is a valediction addressed by the person remaining to one who is departing. I am not aware of its ever being used as a drinking toast. The traditional Irish toast is ''[[wikt:sláinte|Sláinte]]'', which means ''Health!'' It is possible that Joyce is suggesting that the Citizen is not as fluent in the language as he would have us believe. See also [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Cyclops/307|307.35]].

'''Nannan's'''{{spaces|5}}Nickname for Joseph Nannetti, MP for Dublin College Green (1901-1915).&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/people/mr-joseph-nannetti/ Mr Joseph Nannetti (Hansard).]&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Aeolus/115|115.32]].


'''''The Sluagh na h-Eireann'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Errata'') This should read: The ''Sluagh na hÉireann''.


'''''Sluagh na hÉireann'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Irish'') ''The Legion of Ireland'', or ''The Irish Brigade''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 341.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sluagh na hÉireann'' was a patriotic body that promoted the revival of Irish games and customs. It has been described as: ''a short-lived nationalist federation designed to combine the energies of the [[w:Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] and the [[w:Gaelic League|Gaelic League]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nli.ie/pdfs/mss%20lists/156_SweetmanPapers.pdf Owen McGee &amp; Harriet Wheelock (compilers), ''Sweetman Family Papers'', National Library of Ireland, Dublin (2010), p. 86.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 June 1904 Joseph Nannetti complained to Parliament on their behalf that Gaelic sports had been banned from the Phoenix Park by the Commisioners of Police, while the foreign sport of polo was permitted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1904/jun/16/polo-in-phoenix-park ''Hansard'' 16 June 1904.]&lt;/ref&gt; The question was raised again on 30 June by Thomas O'Donnell, MP for Kerry West.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1904/jun/30/phoenix-park-dublin ''Hansard'' 30 June 1904.]&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce has Nannetti ask his question on 17 June.

'''''Na bacleis'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Errata'') This should read: ''Ná bac leis''.


'''''Ná bac leis'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Irish'') ''Never mind that.''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 342.&lt;/ref&gt;


'''''Brian O'Ciarnain's'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Irish'') ''Barney Kiernan's''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 342.&lt;/ref&gt; This is, in fact, a macaronic mixture of Irish and English. The Irish form of the name Bernard Kiernan is, ''Brian Ó Ciarnáin''.


'''''Sraid na Bretaine Bheag'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Errata'') This should read: ''Sráid na Breataine Bheag''.


'''''Sráid na Breataine Bheag'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Irish'') ''Little Britain Street''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 342.&lt;/ref&gt; This means ''Britain Street Little'', rather than ''The Street of Little Britain'', though it is probably fair to say that Joyce set this episode on this street on account of the pun: the New Ireland the Citizen and his ilk wish to establish is just a Little Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geograph.ie/photo/1196043 Little Britain Street.]&lt;/ref&gt; In Irish, ''Little Britain'' (''an Bhreatain Bheag'') actually means Wales or Brittany.


'''''Sluagh na h-Eireann'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Errata'') This should read: ''Sluagh na hÉireann''. See [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Cyclops/302|302.27]].

'''''compos mentis'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') A legal expression meaning ''[[wikt:compos mentis|of sound mind]]'', ''sane''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 345.&lt;/ref&gt;


'''A pishogue, if you know what that is.'''{{spaces|5}}Clearly, the Citizen does not know what that is. A ''[[wikt:pishogue|pishogue]]'' is a magic spell. The [[wikt:Hiberno English|Hiberno-English]] word he is looking for is ''[[wikt:pithogue|pithogue]]'', from the Irish ''[[wikt:piteog|piteog]]'', which means ''an effeminate man'', ''a dandy'', ''a sissy'', or (in modern usage) ''a homosexual'', which is possibly what lies behind the Citizen's insult. The term ''pishogue'' is never applied to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 345. Gifford, in common with most annotators, does not appreciate the Citizen's mistake.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that the mistake is Joyce's rather than the Citizen's. The two words occur on the same page of Father Dineen's ''Irish-English Dictionary'' (first edition). Joyce certainly knew this work; it was first published in 1904, the year in which ''Ulysses'' is set, and Dineen appears in ''Scylla and Charybdis'' ([[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Scylla_and_Charybdis/202|202.31-32]] and [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Scylla_and_Charybdis/206|206.30]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Foclóir Gaedhilge agus Béarla: An Irish-English Dictionary |last=Dineen |first=Patrick S. |year=1904 |publisher=M. H. Gill &amp; Son Ltd. |location=Dublin |isbn= |page=508 |url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/Dinneen1sted.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the mistake is the Citizen's, it is another indication that he is not as fluent in the Irish language as he would have us believe.

'''Decree ''nisi'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') A [[w:Decree nisi|legal term]] from the Latin ''[[wikt:decree nisi|nisi]]'' (''unless''), denoting a court order that will become [[wikt:decree absolute|absolute]] at a specified date unless cause can be shown why it should not.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 348.&lt;/ref&gt; In British law the term is most commonly applied to the initial stage of divorce proceedings, the divorce becoming absolute six months later. J. J. O'Molloy, a solicitor, is jocosely suggesting that the adultery of [[w:Derbforgaill|Derbforgaill]] and her paramour [[w:Diarmait Mac Murchada|Diarmait Mac Murchada]] might have been used by her husband [[w:Tigernán Us Ruairc|Tigernán Us Ruairc]] as grounds for a divorce.

'''''patois'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''a regional or substandard dialect''. The word ''[[wikt:patois#French|patois]]'' originally meant: ''incomprehensible speech, or rude language'', which is the point the Citizen is making about English.


'''''cabinet d'aisance'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''water closet'', ''toilet''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 349.&lt;/ref&gt;


'''''Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!'''''{{spaces|5}}(''French'') ''Down with the English! Treacherous England''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 349.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Conspuez'' derives from the Latin ''[[wikt:conspuere|conspuere]]'' (''to spit on''), though the primary meaning in French is ''to boo''. The latter phrase, ''[[w:Perfidious Albion|Perfidious Albion]]'', is of obscure origin.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton (1968) 278-279.&lt;/ref&gt; Variants of this phrase have been used a byword for English fickleness since the 13th century, while the familiar form was probably coined by Augustin, Marquis of Ximenez in 1793. See also [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Cyclops/316|316.26-27]].

'''''Lamh Dearg Abu'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Errata'') The correct form is: ''Lámh Dhearg Abú''.


'''''Lámh Dhearg Abú'''''{{spaces|5}} (''Irish'') ''Red Hand to Victory''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 349.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 279.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[w:Red Hand of Ulster|Red Hand of Ulster]] (''Lámh Dhearg Uladh'') has been a traditional symbol for the province of Ulster and its legendary figures since pagan times. ''Lámh Dhearg Abú'' was the war-cry of the [[w:O'Neill dynasty|O'Neills]], who ruled large tracts of Ireland (including Ulster) since the 5th century.

The Red Hand was also depicted on the labels of bottles of Allsop's ale, so the phrase was also used as a drinking cry. See [[Annotations_to_James_Joyce's_Ulysses/Cyclops/314|314.33-35]].


'''''Raimeis'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Errata'') This should read: ''Ráiméis''.


'''''Ráiméis'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Irish'') ''Rubbish'', ''Poppycock''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 349-350.&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish word ''[[wikt:ráiméis|ráiméis]]'' derives from the Norman-French ''Romance'', referring to the far-fetched [[w:Romance (heroic literature)|tales]] of Medieval literature. It became a household word for empty hypocritical talk or [[wikt:cant|cant]] in the first decade of the 20th century thanks to its regular use by the journalist [[w:D. P. Moran|D. P. Moran]] in ''The Leader''.

'''the church of Saint Fiacre ''in Horto'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') [[w:Fiacre|Saint Fiacre]] is the patron saint of gardeners. ''In Horto'' is Latin for ''in a garden''. There was no Church of Saint Fiacre in Ireland in 1904; Fiacre's 7th-century hermitage Kilfiachra has given its name to a townland and a civil parish, both known as Kilferagh, in [[w:County Kilkenny|County Kilkenny]].&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 354.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''chanting the introit in ''Epiphania Domini'' which beginneth ''Surge, illuminare'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') The [[w:Introit|Introit]] is the entrance chant in the [[w:Roman Rite|Roman Rite]] of the [[w:Tridentine Mass|Latin Tridentine Mass]], which was still in use in the Catholic Church in 1904. ''Epiphania Domini'' (''The Epiphany of Our Lord'') is the Mass for the [[w:Epiphany_(holiday)|Epiphany of Our Lord]], which fell on 6 January. The introit, however, does not begin with the words ''Surge, illuminare''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 377.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 301.&lt;/ref&gt; Those are the opening words of the Lesson (First Reading), which is Isaiah 60:1-6:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/stream/MissaleRomanum1603#page/n167/mode/1up ''Missale Romanum 1603''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

''And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.''
''Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather themselves together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side.''

'''And he laid his hands upon that he blessed...'''{{spaces|5}}''And he laid his hands upon those things which he blessed...''. Here, ''[[wikt:that#Pronoun|that]]'' is the relative pronoun, used archaically, with ellipsis of the antecedent, to refer to a plurality of things. See the Oxford English Dictionary: '''that''', ''pron.''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; '''I. 3. a.'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/ Oxford English Dictionary.] (Access required.)&lt;/ref&gt;


'''''Deus, cuius verbo santificantur omnia ... per Christum Dominum nostrum'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Latin'') ''O God, by whose word all things are made holy, pour down your blessing on these your creations : and grant that whoever shall make use of them, with gratitude and in accordance with your law and your will, may, by calling on your most holy name, receive at your instigation health of body and protection of soul, through Christ our Lord.''&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 378.&lt;br&gt;Thornton (1968) 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the ''Benedictio Pro Re Quacumque'' (''Blessing for Anything''), which is given in some editions of the ''[[w:Roman Ritual|Rituale Romanum]]'' as a general blessing for use in circumstances where none of the standard blessings would be suitable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/stream/cihm_48368#page/n265/mode/2up ''Compendium Ritualis Romani'' 247-248.]&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, however, there ''are'' suitable blessings that could have been used to bless ''the viands and the beverages'': for example, ''Benedictio ad Quodcumque Comestibile'' (''Blessing for Anything Edible'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/stream/cihm_48368#page/n179/mode/2up ''Compendium Ritualis Romani'' 165.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Abba!'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Syriac-Greek'') ''Father''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 381.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[wikt:Abba|word]] is chiefly used as an invocation to God as the Heavenly Father.


'''''Adonai!'''''{{spaces|5}}(''Hebrew'') ''My Lord''.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1988) 381.&lt;/ref&gt; This term is usually substituted for the [[wikt:Tetragrammaton|Tetragrammaton]] [[wikt:YHWH|YHWH]], the sacred name of the God, which Jews consider too sacred to be uttered.

      <comment>removing double &quot;raw meat&quot; advisory</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Removing note on raw meat hazards==
Just removed the following paragraph:

:&quot;It is very likely that one can contract either pathogenic E Coli infection or salmonellosis since even the best ground beef is a composite of many different slaughtered animals, increasing the risk incrementally.&quot;

The first part (&quot;It is very likely that...&quot;) is pretty absurd; yes, there is the risk, but if contamination was &quot;very likely&quot;, I believe we'd have an ambulance awaiting in front of every restaurant that serves this dish. :-)

The second part (&quot;ground beef is a composite...&quot;) might be true in some countries, but in others it is not. Where I live, the majority of ground beef (high or low quality) one can buy comes from a single piece of meat, from a single animal. Besides, this paragraph was superfluous since the standard &quot;raw-meat&quot; template (which is much more reasonable in content) has been added to the page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">====2.5 Function====
----

'''2.5.1 Explain the role of producers, consumers and decomposers in the ecosystem.'''
:* Producers: Organisms that use sunlight energy to create food are called Photoautotrophs
:* Consumers: They eat other organisms to obtain energy. For example, herbivores will eat the plants, then the herbivores are eaten by carnivores or omnivores
:* Decomposers: Obtain energy from breakdown of dead organic matter. They are key to the nitrogen cycle. They convert ammonia from decomposing organisms and excretory waste into nitrites and ultimately into nitrates. Plants then take nitrates through their Root systems

'''2.5.2 Describe photosynthesis and respiration in terms of inputs, outputs and energy transformations.'''
:* Photosynthesis (CO2 + H2O --&gt; C6H12O6 + O2)
   Inputs: Carbon Dioxide &amp; Water
   Outputs: Glucose &amp; Oxygen
   Transformations: Producers transform light energy (from the sun) into chemical energy

:* Respiration (C6H12O6 + O2 --&gt; CO2 + H2O + Heat)
   Inputs: Glucose &amp; Oxygen
   Outputs: Carbon Dioxide &amp; Water
   Transformations: Chemical Energy turns into Heat

'''2.5.3 Describe and explain the transfer and transformation of energy as it flows through an ecosystem.'''

- Explain pathways of incoming solar radiation 
incident on the ecosystem including:
:* loss of radiation through reflection and absorption
:* conversion of light to chemical energy
:* loss of chemical energy from one trophic level to another
:* efficiencies of transfer
:* overall conversion of light to heat energy by an ecosystem
:* re-radiation of heat energy to the atmosphere.

- Construct and analyse simple energy-flow 
diagrams illustrating the movement of energy 
through ecosystems, including the productivity 
of the various trophic levels.
:* Storages = Boxes
:* Flows of energy or productivity = Arrows

'''2.5.4 Describe and explain the transfer and transformation of materials as they cycle within an ecosystem.'''

:* Processes involving the transfer and transformation of carbon, nitrogen and water  as they cycle within an ecosystem should be described, and the conversion of organic and inorganic storage noted where appropriate. Construct and analyse flow diagrams of these cycles

'''2.5.5 Define the terms Gross productivity, net productivity, primary productivity and secondary productivity.'''

:* Gross Productivity: The &lt;u&gt;total gain&lt;/u&gt; in energy or biomass per unit area per unit time, which  could be through photosynthesis in primary producers or absorption in consumers.
:* Net Productivity: The gain in energy or biomass per unit area per unit time remaining after allowing for respiratory losses (R). Other metabolic losses may take place, but these may be ignored when calculating and defining net productivity for the purpose of this course.
:* Primary Productivity: The gain by producers in energy or biomass per unit area per unit time. This term could refer to either gross or net primary productivity.
:* Secondary Productivity: The biomass gained by heterotrophic organisms, through feeding and absorption, measured in units of mass or energy per unit area per unit time.

     Productivity is production per unit time.

'''2.5.6 Define the terms and calculate the values of both gross primary productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP) from given''' '''data.'''

:* Gross Primary Productivity: The total gain in energy or biomass per unit area per unit time fixed by photosynthesis in green plants.
:* Net Primary Productivity: The gain by producers in energy or biomass per unit area per unit time remaining after allowing for respiratory losses (R). This is potentially available to consumers in an ecosystem.

   Use the equation NPP = GPP – R, where R = respiratory loss

'''2.5.7 Define the terms and calculate the values of both gross secondary productivity (GSP) and net secondary productivity (NSP) from''' '''given data.'''

:* Gross Secondary Productivity: The total gain by consumers in energy or biomass per unit area per unit time through absorption.
:* Net Secondary Productivity: The gain by consumers in energy or biomass per unit area per unit time remaining after allowing for respiratory losses (R).

    Use the equation NSP = GSP – R, where R = respiratory loss
    Use the equation GSP = food eaten – fecal loss

      <text xml:space="preserve">====5.2 Detection and Monitoring of Pollution====
----

'''5.2.1  Describe two direct methods of monitoring pollution.'''

-air pollution-
:* measure the acidity of rain water to determine levels of
:* measure CO2, CO, or NOx levels in the atmosphere using a gas sensor
:* measure particulate matter suspended in the atmosphere
-soil pollution-
:* conduct tests for nitrates and phosphates according to the test manufacturer’s instructions 
:* measure the level of organic matter in the soil
-water pollution-
:* nitrate and phosphate tests
:* fecal coliform tests
:* tests for heavy metals

'''5.2.2 Define the term biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and explain how this indirect method is used to assess pollution levels in water.'''

:* Biochemical Oxygen Demand: A measure of the amount of dissolved oxygen required to break down the organic material in a given volume of water through aerobic biological activity.
  high BOD indicates there are many organisms using oxygen for respiration
  low BOD indicates relatively few organisms needing oxygen for respiration
  high BOD = low DO levels = high pollutant levels, especially nitrate &amp; phosphate
  low BOD = high DO levels = low pollutant levels

'''5.2.3 Describe and explain an indirect method of measuring pollution levels using a biotic index.'''
:* We can measure pollution levels 2 different ways: we can measure the pollution itself
directly, or we can use some other factor that is correlated to pollution levels as an
indirect indicator of those pollution levels.
:* the Trent Biotic Index uses the presence or absence of 6 key organisms(plecopteran larvae, ephemeropteran larvae, trichopteran larvae, Gammarus, Asellus and tubificids plus red chironomid larvae) to indicate the relative level of pollution in a stream.
  Advantage: Easy to use, especially for moderately or heavily polluted sites.
  Disadvantages: not specific enough, doesn’t fully account for habitat quality

:* We can also use “abiotic factors that change as a result of the pollutant” to indirectly test the pollution levels such as dissolved oxygen (DO) or BOD levels of the water
  Indicator species are those species that are present either only in polluted areas or only in unpolluted areas. 
  For example… 
  o freshwater shrimp, 
  o freshwater mussels,
  o stonefly nymphs, 
  o caddisfly larvae, 
  o rat-tailed maggot    
  o sludge worms in polluted water, 
  o peppered moth wing color (predominantly black indicates high levels of soot and particulate matter in the air; predominantly light grey indicates relatively particulate-free air), 
  o Gammarus - small crustaceans that are sensitive to different salinity levels, 
  o Asellus - another small freshwater crustacean, which is relatively tolerant of pollution, and therefore an indicator of polluted sites

      <text xml:space="preserve">====1.1. Systems and Models====
----

It is essential that the systems approach is used throughout this course. This approach identifies the 
elements of the systems, and examines the relationships and processes that link these elements into a 
functioning entity. This topic may be best viewed therefore as a theme to be used in the delivery of the 
other topics, rather than as an isolated teaching topic.
The topic identifies some of the underlying principles that can be applied to living systems, from the level 
of the individual up to that of the whole biosphere. It would therefore be helpful to describe and analyse 
the systems addressed in the terms laid out in this topic (wherever possible). The systems approach also 
emphasizes the similarities between environmental systems, biological systems and artificial entities such 
as transport and communication systems. This approach stresses that there are concepts, techniques and 
terms that can be transferred from one discipline (such as ecology) to another (such as engineering).
