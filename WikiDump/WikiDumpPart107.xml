{{tocright}}{{drop|N}}eopagans and Wiccans observe eight festivals each year, known as Sabbats, which commemorate the annual cycle of seasons or phases of the sun and moon. This cycle is referred to as the Wheel of the Year, with festivities spaced at approximately even intervals throughout the calendar. Traditionally the festivals mark the solstices and equinoxes, and the times for planting and harvest of crops.

The Wheel of the Year is a modern development of Wicca and Neopaganism originating from traditional holidays observed by Pagan cultures of ancient Europe. No pre-Christian European cultures celebrated all eight Sabbats of the calendar, so the Wheel of the Year comprises a modern merging of traditional festivals from all over ancient Europe, with similarities to the ancient rituals often ending at their shared names alone.

Modern interpretations of ancient practices vary widely, therefore different groups may conceptualize and celebrate the Sabbats in very different ways, but the themes and meanings are generally similar. For some, the Wheel of the Year not only describes the continuous cycles of nature and time, but also the human progression through birth, life, decline and death. For many Wiccans, it represents the cycle of life, death, and rebirth of the Horned God and fertility of the Goddess.

Inspired by Gaelic fire festivals, the ''Cross-Quater Days'' (or ''Greater Sabbats'') mark the beginning of each [[w:en:Season#Traditional_season_divisions|traditional season]] (as opposed to [[w:en:Season#Astronomical|astronomical seasons]]) and fall approximately half-way between a solstice and an equinox. Generally, and mostly for convenience, the Greater Sabbats are celebrated on the first day of the season.

In British and Irish traditions of the Middle Ages, ''Quarter Days'' (or ''Lesser Sabbats'') fell close to the two solstice and two equinox holidays. These were dates on which servants were hired, rents or rates were due, and magistrates would determine debts and resolve conflicts in outlying rural regions. In England today, leasehold payments and rents for business premises are often still due on the old English Quarter Days.  The timing of these Lesser Sabbats are determined by the relationship of the Sun to the Earth so their dates deviate slightly each year.

Interestingly, the Sabbats fall closely to, or on the same dates, as eight points of the [[w:en:Solar_term|24 Solar Terms]] in traditional lunisolar calendars that were developed independently in East Asia. 

As seasons in the Southern Hemisphere are reversed to those of the North, so too is the Wheel of the Year. In Australia and New Zealand the long familiar &quot;Christmas in July&quot;, though not an official holiday, is fitting evidence of efforts to suitably inverse Pagan festivals for the Southern regions.

The Celtics recognised that a new day began in the darkness, so too the start of a new year. Thus Samhain, the Celtic Feast of the Dead and beginning of Winter, is generally recognised as the first Sabbat of the year.  Below, are the eight festivals and their dates, conveniently inversed for Southern Hemisphere practitioners of the craft.

      <comment>that's not a spelling correction. British English is not incorrect.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Monads|noexercises=1}}

Among the initial examples of monads, there were some which used an alternative syntax with &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; blocks for chaining computations. Those examples, however, were not the first time we have seen &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;: back in [[Haskell/Simple input and output|Simple input and output]] we had seen how code for doing input-output was written in an identical way. That is no coincidence: what we have been calling IO actions are just ''computations in a monad'' - namely, the &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; monad. We will revisit &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; soon; for now, though, let us consider exactly how the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation translates into regular monadic code. Since the following examples all involve &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt;, we will refer to the computations/monadic values as ''actions'', like in the earlier parts of the book. Still &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; works with any monad; there is nothing specific about &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; in how it works.

== Translating the ''then'' operator ==

The &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; (''then'') operator is easy to translate between &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation and plain code, so we will see it first. For example, suppose we have a chain of actions like the following one:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
putStr &quot;Hello&quot; &gt;&gt; 
putStr &quot; &quot; &gt;&gt; 
putStr &quot;world!&quot; &gt;&gt; 
putStr &quot;\n&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

We can rewrite it in &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
do putStr &quot;Hello&quot;
   putStr &quot; &quot;
   putStr &quot;world!&quot;
   putStr &quot;\n&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

This sequence of instructions is very similar to what you would see in any imperative language such as C. The actions being chained could be anything, as long as all of them are in the same monad. In the context of the &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; monad, for instance, an action might be writing to a file, opening a network connection or asking the user for input. The general way we translate these actions from the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation to standard Haskell code is:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
do action1
   action2
   action3
&lt;/source&gt;

which becomes
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
action1 &gt;&gt;
do action2
   action3
&lt;/source&gt;

and so on until the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block is empty.

== Translating the ''bind'' operator ==

The &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; is a bit more difficult to translate from and to &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation, essentially because it involves passing a value, namely the result of an action, downstream in the binding sequence. These values can be stored using the &lt;code&gt;&lt;-&lt;/code&gt; notation, and used downstream in the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block.
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
do x1 &lt;- action1
   x2 &lt;- action2
   action3 x1 x2
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;x1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;x2&lt;/code&gt; are the results of &lt;code&gt;action1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;action2&lt;/code&gt; (for instance, if &lt;code&gt;action1&lt;/code&gt; is an &lt;code&gt;IO Integer&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;code&gt;x1&lt;/code&gt; will be bound to an &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt;). They are passed as arguments to &lt;code&gt;action3&lt;/code&gt;, whose return type is a third action. The &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block is broadly equivalent to the following vanilla Haskell snippet:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
action1 &gt;&gt;= \x1 -&gt; action2 &gt;&gt;= \x2 -&gt; action3 x1 x2
&lt;/source&gt;

The second argument of &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; is a function specifying what to do with the result of the action passed as first argument; and so by chaining lambdas in this way we can pass results downstream. Remember that without extra parentheses a lambda extends all the way to the end of the expression, so &lt;code&gt;x1&lt;/code&gt; is still in scope at the point we call &lt;code&gt;action3&lt;/code&gt;. We can rewrite the chain of lambdas more legibly as:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
action1 &gt;&gt;= \x1 -&gt;
action2 &gt;&gt;= \x2 -&gt;
action3 x1 x2
&lt;/source&gt;
 
=== The ''fail'' method ===

Above we said the snippet with lambdas was &quot;broadly equivalent&quot; to the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block. It is not an exact translation because the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation adds special handling of pattern match failures. &lt;code&gt;x1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;x2&lt;/code&gt; when placed at the left of either &lt;code&gt;&lt;-&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-&gt;&lt;/code&gt; are patterns being matched. Therefore, if &lt;code&gt;action1&lt;/code&gt; returned a &lt;code&gt;Maybe Integer&lt;/code&gt; we could write a &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block like this...

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
do Just x1 &lt;- action1
   x2      &lt;- action2
   action3 x1 x2
&lt;/source&gt;

...and &lt;code&gt;x1&lt;/code&gt; will be bound to an &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt;. In such a case, however, what happens if &lt;code&gt;action1&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;? Ordinarily, the program would crash with an non-exhaustive patterns error, just like the one we get when calling &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; on an empty list. With &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation, however, failures will be handled with the &lt;code&gt;fail&lt;/code&gt; method for the relevant monad. The translation of the first statement done behind the scenes is equivalent to:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
action1 &gt;&gt;= f
where f (Just x1) = do x2 &lt;- action2
                       action3 x1 x2
      f _         = fail &quot;...&quot; -- A compiler-generated message.
&lt;/source&gt;

What &lt;code&gt;fail&lt;/code&gt; actually does is up to the monad instance. While it will often just rethrow the pattern matching error, monads which incorporate some sort of error handling may deal with the failure in their own specific ways. For instance, &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; has {{nowrap|1=&lt;code&gt;fail _ = Nothing&lt;/code&gt;}}; analogously, for the list monad {{nowrap|1=&lt;code&gt;fail _ = []&lt;/code&gt;}} &lt;ref&gt;That explains why, as we pointed out [[Haskell/Pattern_matching#List_comprehensions|in the &quot;Pattern matching&quot; chapter]], pattern matching failures in list comprehensions are silently ignored.&lt;/ref&gt;.

All things considered, the &lt;code&gt;fail&lt;/code&gt; method is an artefact of &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation. It is better not to call it directly from your code, and to only rely on automatic handling of pattern match failures when you are sure that &lt;code&gt;fail&lt;/code&gt; will do something sensible for the monad you are using.

== Example: user-interactive program ==
{{Body note|We are going to interact with the user, so we will use &lt;code&gt;putStr&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;getLine&lt;/code&gt; alternately. To avoid unexpected results in the output remember to disable output buffering importing &lt;code&gt;System.IO&lt;/code&gt; and putting &lt;code&gt;hSetBuffering stdout NoBuffering&lt;/code&gt; at the top of your code. Otherwise you can explictly flush the output buffer before each interaction with the user (namely a &lt;code&gt;getLine&lt;/code&gt;) using &lt;code&gt;hFlush stdout&lt;/code&gt;. If you are testing this code with ghci you don't have such problems.}}

Consider this simple program that asks the user for his or her first and last names:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
nameDo :: IO ()
nameDo = do putStr &quot;What is your first name? &quot;
            first &lt;- getLine
            putStr &quot;And your last name? &quot;
            last &lt;- getLine
            let full = first ++ &quot; &quot; ++ last
            putStrLn (&quot;Pleased to meet you, &quot; ++ full ++ &quot;!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

The code in &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation is readable and easy to follow. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;-&lt;/code&gt; notation makes it possible to treat first and last names ''as if'' they were pure variables, though they never can be in reality: function &lt;code&gt;getLine&lt;/code&gt; is not pure because it can give a different result every time it is run.

A possible translation into vanilla monadic code would be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
nameLambda :: IO ()
nameLambda = putStr &quot;What is your first name? &quot; &gt;&gt;
             getLine &gt;&gt;= \first -&gt;
             putStr &quot;And your last name? &quot; &gt;&gt;
             getLine &gt;&gt;= \last -&gt;
             let full = first ++ &quot; &quot; ++ last
             in putStrLn (&quot;Pleased to meet you, &quot; ++ full ++ &quot;!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

In cases like this, in which we just want to chain several actions, the imperative style of &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation feels natural, and can be pretty convenient. In comparison, monadic code with explicit binds and lambdas is something of an acquired taste.

The example includes a &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; statement in the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block. They are translated to a regular &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; expression, with the &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; part being the translation of whatever follows it in the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block (in the example, that means the final &lt;code&gt;putStrLn&lt;/code&gt;).

== Returning values ==

The last statement in a &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation is the result of the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block. In the previous example, the result was of the type &lt;code&gt;IO ()&lt;/code&gt;, that is an empty value in the &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; monad.

Suppose that we want to rewrite the example, but returning a &lt;code&gt;IO String&lt;/code&gt; with the acquired name. All we need to do is add a &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
nameReturn :: IO String
nameReturn = do putStr &quot;What is your first name? &quot;
                first &lt;- getLine
                putStr &quot;And your last name? &quot;
                last &lt;- getLine
                let full = first ++ &quot; &quot; ++ last
                putStrLn (&quot;Pleased to meet you, &quot; ++ full ++ &quot;!&quot;)
                return full
&lt;/source&gt;

This example will &quot;return&quot; the full name as a string inside the &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; monad, which can then be utilized downstream elsewhere:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
greetAndSeeYou :: IO ()
greetAndSeeYou = do name &lt;- nameReturn
                    putStrLn (&quot;See you, &quot; ++ name ++ &quot;!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, the name will be obtained from user input and the greeting will be printed as ''side effects'' of &lt;code&gt;nameReturn&lt;/code&gt;. Its return value will then be used to prepare the goodbye message.

This kind of code is why it is so easy to misunderstand the nature of &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;: it does not only share a name with C's keyword, it ''seems'' to have the same function here. A small variation on the example, however, will dispel that impression:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
nameReturnAndCarryOn = do putStr &quot;What is your first name? &quot;
                          first &lt;- getLine
                          putStr &quot;And your last name? &quot;
                          last &lt;- getLine
                          let full = first++&quot; &quot;++last
                          putStrLn (&quot;Pleased to meet you, &quot;++full++&quot;!&quot;)
                          return full
                          putStrLn &quot;I am not finished yet!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

The string in the extra line ''will'' be printed out, as &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; is not a final statement interrupting the flow like in C and other languages. Indeed, the type of &lt;code&gt;nameReturnAndCarryOn&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;IO ()&lt;/code&gt;, the type of the final &lt;code&gt;putStrLn&lt;/code&gt; action, and after the function is called the &lt;code&gt;IO String&lt;/code&gt; created by the &lt;code&gt;return full&lt;/code&gt; will disappear without a trace.

== It is just sugar ==

The &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation is just a syntactical convenience; it does not add anything essential. Keeping that in mind, we can raise a few points about style. First of all, &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; is never necessary for a single action; and so the Haskell &quot;Hello world&quot; is simply...
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
main = putStrLn &quot;Hello world!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

...without any &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; in sight. Additionally, snippets like this one are always redundant:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
fooRedundant = do x &lt;- bar
                  return x
&lt;/source&gt;

Thanks to the [[Haskell/Monads#Monad_Laws|monad laws]], we can (and should!) write it as:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
foo = bar
&lt;/source&gt;

A subtler but crucial point is related to function composition. As we already know, the &lt;code&gt;greetAndSeeYou&lt;/code&gt; action in the section just above could be rewritten as:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
greetAndSeeYou :: IO ()
greetAndSeeYou = nameReturn &gt;&gt;= \name -&gt; putStrLn (&quot;See you, &quot; ++ name ++ &quot;!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

While you might find the lambda a little unsightly, suppose we had a &lt;code&gt;printSeeYou&lt;/code&gt; function defined elsewhere:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
printSeeYou :: String -&gt; IO ()
printSeeYou name = putStrLn (&quot;See you, &quot; ++ name ++ &quot;!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Things suddenly look much nicer, and arguably even nicer than in the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; version:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
greetAndSeeYou :: IO ()
greetAndSeeYou = nameReturn &gt;&gt;= printSeeYou
&lt;/source&gt;

Or, if we had a ''non-monadic'' &lt;code&gt;seeYou&lt;/code&gt; function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
seeYou :: String -&gt; String
seeYou name = &quot;See you, &quot; ++ name ++ &quot;!&quot;

-- Reminder: liftM f m == m &gt;&gt;= return . f == fmap f m
greetAndSeeYou :: IO ()
greetAndSeeYou = liftM seeYou nameReturn &gt;&gt;= putStrLn
&lt;/source&gt;

Keep in mind this last example with &lt;code&gt;liftM&lt;/code&gt;; we will soon return to the theme of using non-monadic functions in monadic code, and why it can be useful.

The '''Messier objects''' are a set of astronomical objects first listed by French astronomer [[w:Charles Messier|Charles Messier]] in his &quot;Catalogue des Nébuleuses et des Amas d'Étoiles&quot; (&quot;Catalogue of Nebulae and Star Clusters&quot;) included in the ''Connaissance des Temps'' for 1774  (published in 1771). The original motivation of the catalogue was that Messier was a comet hunter, and was frustrated by objects which resembled but were not comets. He therefore compiled a list of these objects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=SEDS Messier Database | work=THE MESSIER CATALOG | url=http://seds.org/messier/ | accessdate=2007-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with his assistant Pierre Méchain.

The first edition covered 45 objects numbered M1 to M45. The total list published by Messier finally contained 103 objects, but the list &quot;got an independent life&quot; by successive additions by other astronomers, motivated by side notes in Messier's and Mechain's texts indicating that either of them knew of the objects. The first such addition came from [[w:Camille Flammarion|Camille Flammarion]] in 1921, who added M104 after finding Messiers side note in his 1781 edition exemplar of the catalogue. M105 to M107 were added by [[w:Helen Sawyer Hogg|Helen Sawyer Hogg]] in 1947, M108 and M109 by [[w:Owen Gingerich|Owen Gingerich]] in 1960, and M110 by [[w:Kenneth Glyn Jones|Kenneth Glyn Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;The Guinness Book of Astronomy, [[w:Patrick Moore|Patrick Moore]] and Guinness Superlatives Ltd 1979, ISBN 09-00-42476-1&lt;/ref&gt;  M102 was observed by Méchain, who communicated his notes to Messier; later, it was noted by Méchain himself that this object does not exist, and it was simply a re-observation of M101. Some sources mention the galaxy NGC 5866 as an identification for M102, but its description does not fit with Méchain's notes.

Messier's final catalogue was included in the ''Connaissance des Temps'' for 1784 (published in 1781).&lt;ref&gt;Charles Messier, 1781. Catalogue des Nébuleuses &amp; des amas d'Étoiles. Connoissance des Temps for 1784 (published 1781), pp. 227-267 [Bibcode: 1781CdT..1784..227M]&lt;br&gt;{{cite web | title=Original Messier Catalog of 1781 | work=Original Messier Catalog of 1781 | url=http://seds.org/messier/xtra/Mcat/mcat1781.html#messier1781 | accessdate=2007-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These objects are still known by their '''Messier number''' from this list.

Because Messier lived and did his astronomical work in France in the Northern Hemisphere, the list he compiled contains only objects from the north celestial pole to a celestial latitude of about –35.7°.  Many impressive Southern objects, such as the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds are excluded from the list.  

All of the Messier objects are visible with binoculars or small telescopes (under favorable conditions); therefore they are popular viewing objects for amateur astronomers. In early spring, astronomers sometimes gather for &quot;Messier marathons&quot;, when all of the objects can be viewed over a single night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title=The Messier Marathon
  | work=THE MESSIER MARATHON
  | url=http://seds.org/messier/xtra/marathon/marathon.html
  | accessdate=2007-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A summary of the astrophysics of each Messier object, as well as all of the objects in the [[w:Herschel 400 Catalog|Herschel 400 Catalog]], can be found in ''Concise Catalog of Deep-sky Objects: Astrophysical Information for 500 Galaxies, Clusters and Nebulae'' by W. H. Finlay, ISBN 1-85233-691-9.

      <text xml:space="preserve">New Age music is a style of music that corresponds with the New Age movement. Like the spiritual movement with its amalgam of religious, spiritual and cultural practices, New Age music is characterized by a blend of musical elements appropriated from different cultures.  

Harmony is typically simple and often modal, and there is a strong emphasis on ephemerality.  New Age music often features &quot;pads&quot; and &quot;ethnic&quot; vocals of indeterminate Middle-Eastern/African/South Asian origin.

* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]].

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

PS: I've restored some of the changes you made (C++, dealing with the extension of header files), since it was a statement of a convention used on all the book, if agreed upon, altering it would result in a major work. Another bit also had some errors, not all compilations result in executables. Feel free to ask any clarification you require, I am available and please do continue improving Wikibooks... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:06, 19 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]].

You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!

PS: Fixed that issue on the C++ Programming. Thanks for pointing that out. Nnext time you should use the talk page associated or add a TODO (template) next to the issue (if you don't understand templates see the edit history of that page, I used it to quick fix the comment you posted on the book, anyway good work...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:06, 20 August 2009 (UTC)

PPS: I've examined it closely and the compiler you are using probably isn't up-to-date. I considered that you didn't remove the previous for loop, since then the variable cur_month wouldn't exist in the code (and it wouldn't/shouldn't compile at all), since it did the compiler must be ignoring the scope of the for loop, as the first loop declares and defines it in scope (it shouldn't be recognized outside of it) as it was, hence enabling you to compile the example, the most problematic error is in the compiler itself.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:30, 20 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

If you can't stand the heat, you may of course turn down the cayenne.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 pound ground chuck
* 1-1 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
* 1 tsp Montreal Steak Seasoning
* Olive oil
* 8 slices bacon, crisp cooked
* 4 slices pepper jack cheese
* Lettuce, tomato, and onion (optional)
* 1/2 cup mayonnaise
* 2 chipotle chile in adobo, finely chopped

== Procedure ==
#Combine mayo and chipotle. Refrigerate until needed.
#Combine cayenne, salt, pepper, and seasoning. Set aside.
#Form meat into 4 equal patties, about 1/2 inch thick. Make an indentation in the center of each one and brush with olive oil.
#Sprinkle patties on both sides with seasoning mixture. Set aside.
#Preheat a chimney starter full of charcoal in the bottom of a kettle grill. Once hot, disperse evenly around the bottom of the grill.
#Add burgers and grill, turning often, until desired &quot;doneness&quot; is achieved.
#Place a slice of cheese on each patty once it comes off the grill. Serve with bacon, lettuce, tomato, and chipotle mayo on buns.</text>

Cannot find the system/trigger texture for the life of me... I'm using GtkRadiant 1.5.0 developing for Wolfenstein : Enemy Territory and unless there's another way - I would have to go through literally every texture to find it... There's no &quot;system tag&quot; and as of now I can't find anyway to manually apply textures without using the built in browser... help?
:Try common.. If that doesn't work I have no idea what's wrong.. But this is a game-specific problem so ask in a forum devoted to that game.. They should know. [[User:Yzmo|Yzmo]] ([[User talk:Yzmo|talk]]) 15:15, 18 October 2009 (UTC)</text>

:{{comment}} Should stub-hood be grounds for deletion, if the book has potential to be developed into something worthwhile at some point down the road?  I see two obstacles to this being developed by someone else later, neither of which strikes me as deletion-worthy:  the subject is specialized enough that there is a limited pool of people able to develop it (but that's true of many wikibooks); and potential developers wouldn't notice it because it isn't cataloged (but that can be fixed).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 17:56, 7 July 2009 (UTC)
:{{comment}} I wasn't sure what our exact policy is about old stubs.  On the one hand over at the maintenance page it says &quot;Old stubs may be removed or submitted to WB:VFD.&quot; However the deletion policy seems to say &quot;In general, keep stubs&quot; and mentions nothing about age. Stub-hood alone definitely shouldn't be grounds for deletion.

&lt;br&gt;

* &lt;font size=3&gt;Ascension Island is part of the British overseas territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. It has a population of only about 900 permanent inhabitants and so has only a minor need for postage meters. Although it does issue traditional postage stamps no postage meters are known to be used on this South Atlantic island.

Please be aware that some acronyms may be rephrased to suit the context.
For example, AFM is listed here so as to refer to the Atomic Force Microscope itself, but AFM may also refer to the process of performing Atomic Force Microscopy.  Should common prefixes be given their own places?

At the moment, this is not meant as an extensive list of techniques or processes relevant to nanotechnology.  Instead it is meant to be a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone 'Rosetta stone'] for those unfamiliar with this jargon.

      <comment>+collapsing border</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">CSS offers various ways of setting the appearance the borders of box elements, separately for top border, bottom border, left border and right border. You can set the thickness or width, color and style (such as dotted) or each border.

== Border style ==
* {{CSS:property|border-top-style   }} W3C Specification  [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/box.html#propdef-border-top-style CSS2.1]
* {{CSS:property|border-right-style }} W3C Specification  [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/box.html#propdef-border-right-style CSS2.1]
* {{CSS:property|border-bottom-style}} W3C Specification  [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/box.html#propdef-border-bottom-style CSS2.1]
* {{CSS:property|border-left-style  }} W3C Specification  [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/box.html#propdef-border-left-style CSS2.1]
* {{CSS:property|border-style}}

The following values are valid for the border style properties:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border-style: none;&quot;&gt;{{CSS:value|none}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border-style: hidden;&quot;&gt;{{CSS:value|hidden}} CSS2.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border-style: dotted;&quot;&gt;{{CSS:value|dotted}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border-style: dashed;&quot;&gt;{{CSS:value|dashed}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border-style: solid;&quot;&gt;{{CSS:value|solid}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border-style: double;&quot;&gt;{{CSS:value|double}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border-style: groove;&quot;&gt;{{CSS:value|groove}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border-style: ridge;&quot;&gt;{{CSS:value|ridge}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border-style: inset;&quot;&gt;{{CSS:value|inset}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border-style: outset;&quot;&gt;{{CSS:value|outset}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

CSS rule:
&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
p {
  border-style-top: dotted;
  border-style-right: solid;
  border-style-bottom: dashed;
  border-style-left: groove;
  padding: 0.5em /* Leave a gap between the content and the borders. */
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Sample HTML:
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Different borders can be set on the four sides of an element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

{{CSS:rendered|1=
&lt;p style=&quot;border-style: dotted solid dashed groove; padding: 0.5em&quot;&gt;Different borders can be set on the four sides of an element.&lt;/p&gt;
}}

== Border width ==
* {{CSS:property|border-top-width   }} W3C Specification [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS1#border-top-width CSS1] [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/box.html#propdef-border-top-width CSS2.1]
* {{CSS:property|border-right-width }} W3C Specification [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS1#border-right-width CSS1] [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/box.html#propdef-border-right-width CSS2.1]
* {{CSS:property|border-bottom-width}} W3C Specification [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS1#border-bottom-width CSS1] [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/box.html#propdef-border-bottom-width CSS2.1]
* {{CSS:property|border-left-width  }} W3C Specification [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS1#border-left-width CSS1] [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/box.html#propdef-border-left-width CSS2.1]

The border width properties can be set to any non-negative [[CSS Programming/Lengths|length]] or one of the three keyword values {{CSS:value|thin}}, {{CSS:value|medium}} and {{CSS:value|thick}}. A {{CSS:value|thick}} border is guaranteed to be at least as wide as a {{CSS:value|medium}} border, which in turn is at least as wide as a {{CSS:value|small}} border.

CSS rules:
&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
p {
  border-style:solid;
  padding:0.5em /* Leave a gap between the content and the borders. */
}

#para1 {
  border-width-top:0;
  border-width-right:thin;
  border-width-bottom:medium;
  border-width-left:thick
}

#para2 {
  border-width-top:0.25em;
  border-width-right:0.5em;
  border-width-bottom:0.75em;
  border-width-left:1em
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Sample HTML:
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p id=&quot;para1&quot;&gt;The border on three sides of this paragraph are specified by keywords.
      The top border is zero width.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p id=&quot;para2&quot;&gt;This paragraph's borders are given as lengths, increasing in quarter
     &lt;code&gt;em&lt;/code&gt; increments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

{{CSS:rendered|1=
&lt;p style=&quot;border-style:solid;border-width:0 thin medium thick;padding:0.5em&quot;&gt;The border on three sides of this paragraph are specified by keywords. The top border is zero width.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;border-style:solid;border-width:0.25em 0.5em 0.75em 1em;padding:0.5em&quot;&gt;This paragraph's borders are given as lengths, increasing in quarter &lt;code&gt;em&lt;/code&gt; increments.&lt;/p&gt;
}}

If the border style for a side has been set to {{CSS:value|none}} the width for that border is considered to be zero regardless of the value set for the side's border width.

CSS rules:
&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
p {
  border-style:solid;
  border-width:1em;
  padding:0.5em /* Leave a gap between the content and the borders. */
}

#para2 {
  border-style-left:none
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Sample HTML:
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p id=&quot;para1&quot;&gt;This paragraph has a solid &lt;code&gt;1em&lt;/code&gt; border.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p id=&quot;para2&quot;&gt;The left border of this paragraph has been set to &lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt;.
      Notice that the border width has effectively been set to zero.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

{{CSS:rendered|1=
&lt;p style=&quot;border:1em solid;padding:0.5em&quot;&gt;This paragraph has a solid &lt;code&gt;1em&lt;/code&gt; border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;border-width:1em;border-style:solid solid solid none;padding:0.5em&quot;&gt;The left border of this paragraph has been set to &lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt;. Notice that the border width has effectively been set to zero.&lt;/p&gt;
}}

== Border color ==
* {{CSS:property|border-top-color   }} W3C Specification  [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/box.html#propdef-border-top-color CSS2.1]
* {{CSS:property|border-right-color }} W3C Specification  [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/box.html#propdef-border-right-color CSS2.1]

The border color properties may be set to any [[CSS Programming/Color|CSS color]] or the keyword {{CSS:value|transparent}}. If no color is specified the border color properties default to the value of the {{CSS:property|color}} for the element.

Example 1

CSS rule:
&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
p {
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 2em;
  border-color-top: red;
  border-color-right: green;
  border-color-bottom: blue;
  border-color-left: yellow;
  padding: 0.5em; /* Leave a gap between the content and the borders. */
  width: 10em /* Narrow the box a bit. */
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Sample HTML:
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example the border of this box should have four different colours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Example rendering:
{{CSS:rendered|1=
&lt;div style=&quot;border:2em solid;border-color:red green blue yellow;padding:0.5em;width:10em&quot;&gt;
For example the border of this box should have four different colours.
&lt;/div&gt;
}}

Example 2

CSS rules:
&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
p {
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 2em;
  padding: 0.5em /* Leave a gap between the content and the borders. */
}

#para1 {
  color: red
}

#para1 {
  color: green
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Sample HTML:
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p id=&quot;para1&quot;&gt;This paragraph has red text and a red border.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p id=&quot;para2&quot;&gt;This paragraph has green text and a green border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Example rendering:
{{CSS:rendered|1=
&lt;p style=&quot;border-style:solid;border-width:2em;padding:0.5em;color:red&quot;&gt;This paragraph has red text and a red border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;border-style:solid;border-width:2em;padding:0.5em;color:green&quot;&gt;This paragraph has green text and a green border.&lt;/p&gt;
}}

&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
h1 {
  border: black solid thin;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Creates a black line around the content and padding of all {{HTML:element|h1}} elements.
In this example the first value is the color, the second value is the line type and the third value is the line thickness. The values for the individual properties may appear in any order. The following two rules are equivalent to the previous rule.
&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
h1 {
  border: solid black thin;
}

h1 {
  border: thin black solid;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Border radius==
[http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/#the-border-radius Border radius] styles are a part of the [http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/ CSS3 background and borders module]. Currently &lt;code&gt;border-radius&lt;/code&gt; is supported by WebKit (Safari, Chrome ''et al.'') &amp; Presto (Opera). Gecko (Firefox, Iceweasel) supports it with the &lt;code&gt;-moz-&lt;/code&gt; prefix and slightly different syntax. Trident (Internet Explorer) will support it in the next version, version 5 (IE 9). WebKit has only recently supported it without prefix, so designers may wish to keep the &lt;code&gt;-webkit-&lt;/code&gt; prefix in their sheets for backwards compatibility for a little while longer.

Syntax:
&lt;pre lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
border-radius: [ &lt;length&gt; | &lt;percentage&gt; ]{1,4} [ / [ &lt;length&gt; | &lt;percentage&gt; ]{1,4} ]?;

border-top-left-radius: [ &lt;length&gt; | &lt;percentage&gt; ] [ &lt;length&gt; | &lt;percentage&gt; ]?;
border-top-right-radius: [ &lt;length&gt; | &lt;percentage&gt; ] [ &lt;length&gt; | &lt;percentage&gt; ]?;
border-bottom-right-radius: [ &lt;length&gt; | &lt;percentage&gt; ] [ &lt;length&gt; | &lt;percentage&gt; ]?;
border-bottom-left-radius: [ &lt;length&gt; | &lt;percentage&gt; ] [ &lt;length&gt; | &lt;percentage&gt; ]?;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Border radius takes at least 1 length per argument for the length of the radius of that corner. Two radii with a &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; between indicate that it is an ellipse.

&lt;div style=&quot;border:1px solid; border-radius: 10px; -moz-border-radius: 10px; padding: 0.25em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
div {
  border-radius: 10px;
  -moz-border-radius: 10px;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


Taking an earlier example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
p {
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 2em;
  border-color-top: red;
  border-color-right: green;
  border-color-bottom: blue;
  border-color-left: yellow;
  padding: 0.5em; /* Leave a gap between the content and the borders. */
  width: 10em /* Narrow the box a bit. */
  border-radius: 2em;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Sample HTML:
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example the border of this box should have four different colours and rounded corners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Example rendering:
{{CSS:rendered|1=
&lt;div style=&quot;border: 2em solid; border-color: red green blue yellow; padding: 0.5em; width: 10em; border-radius: 2em; -webkit-border-radius: 2em; -moz-border-radius: 2em;&quot;&gt;
For example the border of this box should have four different colours and rounded corners.
&lt;/div&gt;
}}

The border radius can be applied to any type of border the designer wishes (though care must be taken that it looks good):
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border-style: none; border-radius: 10px; -moz-border-radius: 10px;&quot;&gt;{{CSS:value|none}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border-style: hidden; border-radius: 10px; -moz-border-radius: 10px;&quot;&gt;{{CSS:value|hidden}} CSS2.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border-style: dotted; border-radius: 10px; -moz-border-radius: 10px;&quot;&gt;{{CSS:value|dotted}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border-style: dashed; border-radius: 10px; -moz-border-radius: 10px;&quot;&gt;{{CSS:value|dashed}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border-style: solid; border-radius: 10px; -moz-border-radius: 10px;&quot;&gt;{{CSS:value|solid}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border-style: double; border-radius: 10px; -moz-border-radius: 10px;&quot;&gt;{{CSS:value|double}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border-style: groove; border-radius: 10px; -moz-border-radius: 10px;&quot;&gt;{{CSS:value|groove}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border-style: ridge; border-radius: 10px; -moz-border-radius: 10px;&quot;&gt;{{CSS:value|ridge}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border-style: inset; border-radius: 10px; -moz-border-radius: 10px;&quot;&gt;{{CSS:value|inset}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border-style: outset; border-radius: 10px; -moz-border-radius: 10px;&quot;&gt;{{CSS:value|outset}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


===Mixed radii===
The radii of the 4 corners need not be the same length. You can mix and match any combination of radii you wish.

&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid; border-radius: 0 0 10px 10px; -moz-border-radius: 0 0 10px 10px;&quot;&gt;
This div is suited for the top of a web page. Putting a '''0''' in without a unit indicates that no radius is to be applied.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid; border-radius: 0 0 10px 10px;&quot;&gt;
This div is suited for the top of a web page. Putting a '''0''' in without a unit indicates that no radius is to be applied.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid; border-bottom-left-radius: 10px; border-bottom-right-radius: 10px; -moz-border-radius-bottomright: 10px; -moz-border-radius-bottomleft: 10px&quot;&gt;
Conversely, this one is suited for the bottom of a page.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid; border-bottom-left-radius: 10px; border-bottom-right-radius: 10px;&quot;&gt;
Conversely, this one is suited for the bottom of a page.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid; border-radius: 10px 0 10px 0; -moz-border-radius: 10px 0 10px 0; height: 100px; width: 100px;&quot;&gt;
You can also make something fancy.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid; border-radius: 10px 0 10px 0; height: 100px; width: 100px;&quot;&gt;
You can also make something fancy.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Border radius ellipses===
Giving two lengths in an argument separated by a &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; will produce an ellipse for that corner or corners.

&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border: thin solid; border-radius: 5px / 10px;&quot;&gt;
A div with &lt;code&gt;border-radius: 5px / 10px;&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border: thin solid; border-radius: 10px / 5px;&quot;&gt;
A div with &lt;code&gt;border-radius: 5px / 10px;&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Внима́ние! (Attention!)''' is a list of words or phrases that English speakers should pay special attention to. These are either pairs of words that reduce to a single word in English, or words that have shades of meaning that are not usually noted in a dictionary entry.

==то́же — та́кже==
Both mean &quot;also&quot;, but the difference in meaning concerns the scope. The word '''то́же''' is used when including the subject with a group or another individual. If Sergei says &quot;я говорю́ по–ру́сски&quot;, then Andrei can respond by saying &quot;я то́же&quot;. It has the sense of &quot;me too!&quot; when used during a dialogue. The word '''та́кже''' is only used when speaking about the same subject. Sergei can say &quot;я говорю́ по–ру́сски и та́кже [[:wikt:уметь|уме́ю]] [[:wikt:танцевать|танцева́ть]]&quot;.

==почему́ — заче́м==
These words are interrogatives meaning &quot;why&quot;. '''Почему''' is the more commonly-used one, an all-purpose word used when simply asking for the reason for something. &quot;Почему́ [[:wikt:небо|не́бо]] [[:wikt:голубой|голубо́е]]?&quot; '''Зачем''' literally means &quot;for what&quot; and carries this more direct connotation. &quot;Зачем ты [[:wikt:разбиться|разби́лся]] [[:wikt:ваза|ва́зу]]?&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Australia =

&lt;font size=3&gt;Starting with the first meter in 1927 Australia used license numbers rather than meter numbers in a complex series of steps:
::1st series (1927): A1-A9 through Z1–Z9 
::2nd series (1930): 10–999 
::3rd series (1949): A10-A99 through Z10-Z99 
::4th series (1956): AA1-AZ9 through ZA1-ZZ9
::5th series (1966): 10A-99A through 10Z-99Z
::6th series (1969): 2A1-2Z9 through 9A1-2Z9

Since 1969 manufacturer-assigned meter numbers began replacing the license numbers in the stamps. The meter number with prefix can resemble a license number, and the two can be confused. Additionally, many meters with license numbers also show a manufacturer’s prefix.

License numbers are occasionally found colorless on a solid ground. This variety is not recognized in the listings. Other varieties worth noting but which are not cataloged are:
:{|
| • TM varieties such as inverts, negative lettering

| • TMs containing “RELIEF” indicating a meter on loan while a customer’s machine is being serviced

|-

| • TMs containing “TRIAL” indicating a meter in live testing

| • TMs containing “DATE POSTED” instead of a town name

|-

| • Meter numbers boxed or unboxed

| • £sd value figures with capital or lower case pence indicator (D/d) with or without a dot below

|-

| • Variable size digits in the F/V on fixed value (FV) and limited value (LV) machines

| • Date with month in letters, Arabic digit, or Roman numeral
|}


The stamps are grouped according to appearance and usage:
: '''A''' – Upright rectangle with straight-line frame
: '''B''' – Curved ribbon frame
: '''C''' – Flag inside wide rectangle with simulated perforation frame
: '''D''' – Straight-line frame containing large map of country
: '''E''' – Frameless rectangle with pictorial design at left
: '''F''' – Frameless rectangle with flowers at sides
: '''G''' – Wide rectangle with kangaroo design and straight or dashed-line frame or with-out frame 
: '''H''' – Square with simulated perforation frame
: '''I''' – Horizontal rectangle with straight-line frame
: '''J''' – Square with herringbone pattern at sides
: '''K''' – Square frank made up of mostly horizontal lines
: '''L''' – Horizontal frameless frank with Koala bear
: '''M''' – Designs containing a data matrix field (2D barcode)
: '''PO''' – Special stamps for Post Office use

The country converted from Sterling (£sd) to decimal currency on 1 October 1965.&lt;/font&gt;


----
&lt;font size=3&gt;NOTES: Variable rate Post office stamps with pre-printed animal designs were introduced in 1993. The stamps do not include a post office ID or a date. They are not covered in this catalog.

Meters were used extensively for Railway Parcel Post in Australia. These stamps are not federal government issues and are not covered in this catalog.

I'm '''Timothy O'Neill Đặng'''. I'm an economist with particular interests in experimental economics, behavioral economics and game theory.

I've been a [[Wikipedia]] editor for a while, and came to [[Wikibooks]] in August, 2009. Students of the class on &quot;Information economics and the [[Internet]]&quot; began the textbook [[Strategy for Information Markets]] as their semester project.

== [[Strategy for Information Markets|Econ452-Strategy for Information Markets]] ==
This book is continuing in Spring semester 2012. If you are here as a student to work on this book, then [[User:TDang/Econ452|go here]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Create an account ==
To begin, you create an account here at [[Wikibooks]] if you don't already have one. ''If you do already have one, email me, or talk to me in class.''

You can create an account with a pseudonym or your real name.

''Since your classmates might wish to remain anonymous, in discussions on the wiki, please refer to them only by their usernames!''

== Let me know you're here ==
Go to the appropriate class list page and follow the instructions to add your username to the list:
* For Econ 361H, [[User:TDang/Econ361H-Classlist|use this class list]].
* For Econ 452,  [[User:TDang/Econ452-Classlist|use this class list]].

Send me an email letting me know your username, so I can identify your edits.

'''Important:''' ''All your edits must be done under your username, so that I can give you credit. It is possible to edit Wikibooks without logging in. Make sure you don't do so if you want to receive class credit for your edits.''

== Get familiar with Wikibooks ==

To begin with, I recommend looking at [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks|What is Wikibooks]] and [[Using Wikibooks]].

== Start editing ==

Learn how to edit in whatever way works best for you. Working together with a classmate at one machine might be a good way to get started. 

For documentation on editing, I recommend [[Using_Wikibooks/How_To_Edit_A_Wikibook|How To Edit A Wikibook]], [[Using Wikibooks/Wiki-Markup|Wiki-Markup]], and 
[[w:Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page|Wikipedia's instructions on editing]].

=== Do a test edit ===
For your first edit, do something on your userpage. You get to your userpage by clicking on your username in the upper-right-hand corner. As part of your userpage edit, add text like this (replacing &quot;MyUserName&quot; with your username):
 I have a &lt;nowiki&gt;[[User:MyUserName/Sandbox|sandbox]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; for test edits.

That will create a &quot;red link&quot;--a link to a page which doesn't yet exist on the wiki. Click the red link and you'll be able to edit the new &quot;sandbox&quot; page, which will be a good place to mess around while learning wiki editing. You can see that I have done this on [[User:TDang|my userpage]]. 

Another good way to get started editing is to simply pick a page you want to edit, click on &quot;edit this page&quot; (alternatively clicking the &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[edit]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; link on a specific section), and making a change. However, when the change is complete, make sure to hit the &quot;Show preview&quot; button rather than the &quot;Save page&quot; button. That will let you see if you've made mistakes before showing your mistakes to everyone else.

== Do a real edit ==
When you're ready to start editing for real, start with [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|Be Bold]]. Since you're starting with being bold, don't wait too long before jumping into the editing. It's better to make some mistakes than over-think it so you can't get started. However, at about the same time you get started, you might want to check out [[Using_Wikibooks/Policy_and_Guidelines|Policies and guidelines]] to make sure you're working as the other editors here expect you to.

* For Econ 361H, the book you're going to be editing for class is: [[Bestiary of Behavioral Economics]].
* For Econ 452, the book you're going to be editing for class is: [[Strategy for Information Markets]].

== Watchlist ==
When you start editing, I recommend you also change your preferences. Select &quot;my preferences&quot; in the upper-right corner of any page (or just [[Special:Preferences|click here]]), and choose the &quot;Watchlist&quot; tab. The second checkbox from the bottom is &quot;Add pages I edit to my watchlist&quot;. Check that box. Now, whenever you work on a page of the book, you'll also be &quot;watching&quot; that page. You can click on &quot;my watchlist&quot; (or [[Special:Watchlist|here]]), and you will be shown a list of recent edits to any pages you're watching.

== If you have problems ==

If you have technical problems, then your best bet is asking your classmates or hunting around Wikibooks for help.

If you find yourself in conflict with another editor, don't let the heat get too high. [[Wikibooks:Be civil|Be civil]]. One thing to remember is that, even if another editor has changed things, your work still exists and can be recovered. Use the discussion/talk pages to try to reach [[Wikibooks:Decision making|consensus]] with the other editors. If you find yourself getting too angry, take a break and talk to me about it in person or via email before continuing to edit.</text>

==Adler variation==
The Adler variation is named after the game Adler – Maróczy which was played at the 1896 Budapest tournament.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oleinikov5&quot;&gt;Oleinikov chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WCCF&quot;&gt;{{cite web
 | url=http://www.ewccf.com/eco.htm
 | title=ECO classification of WCCF
 | accessdate=2008-05-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt; White is ready to give up the e5-pawn in order to develop all his pieces on their best squares, i.e. the d5-square for the Nb1, the f3-square for the Ng1 and the a1–h8 diagonal for the Bc1.

In the main line 4...Bc5 the f2-pawn is attacked, forcing 5.e3 that blocks the way for the Bc1. Then after 5...Nc6 White has not enough pieces to protect his e5-pawn on the long run, e.g.:
*6.Qd5?! is a doomed attempt, exposing the queen and occupying the d5-square that should belong to the Nb1. This move has a historical interest as this was the line played in the first game where the Budapest Gambit occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Adler – Maroczy, Budapest 1896, won by Black&lt;/ref&gt; Black continues calmly with Qe7/Ngxe5/d6/Be6.
*6.Bd2 O-O 7.Nc3 Qe7 does not prevent Black to regain his pawn either, and it obstructs the way to the d5-square for the Nb1. Once he has the pawn back Black has equality.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;
*6.b3 immediately allows Black to play 6...d6! when White cannot capture in d6 because of Qd8–f6 winning the Ra1. Play will likely transpose into the 6.Be2 variation.

An important theoretical decision for White is to choose whether he wants to make a2–a3 part of his plan or not. While this move avoids any possible Nc6–b4 and creates the possibility b2–b4, it may also be seen as a possible waste of time in some lines. As Lalic puts it:&lt;blockquote&gt;It was not so long ago that 8.a3, with the obvious intention of expanding with b2–b4, was the standard move. However, after Black responds with the logical a7–a5, it became apparent in tournament practice that the inclusion of these moves is in fact in Black's favour, as it gives his queen's rook access into play via the a6-square.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Black can also try the minor line 4...Nc6 that allows Black to delay the development of the f8-diagonal depending on the circumstances, and allows White to transpose into the 4.Bf4 variation if he wishes to do so.

===The 4...Bc5 line with a2–a3===

|After 12.O-O, the middleplay begins}}
''1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Nf3 Bc5 5.e3 Nc6 6.a3''

After the standard moves 6...a5 7.b3 O-O 8.Bb2 Re8 9.Nc3 Ngxe5 10.Nxe5 Nxe5 11.Be2 d6 12.O-O both kings are in safety and Black has regained the invested pawn in the process. Both players can deviate at various points but the positions reached are similar, e.g. in one game White played an early Ra1–b1 in order to push b2–b4 in one move, but Black continued with the same plan as explained hereunder.&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.134&lt;br&gt;Gavrilov – Berdichevsky, Moscow 1989&lt;/ref&gt; In another game White developed his Bf1 in d3 instead of e2, but this gave the opportunity for Black to sacrifice the Ng4 on the f2-pawn before the white castle.&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.135&lt;br&gt;Yrjola – Liew, Dubai Olympiad 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

White has a space advantage in the center and can initiate pressure here or on the queenside by some pawn pushes like b3–b4 and c4–c5 (possibly supported by a knight on the d5-square). Meanwhile, the White king lacks some defenders so Black can start a pieces-driven attack with the standard &quot;rook lift&quot;. As Tseitlin puts it, &quot;the point is that 6...a5 fits into the plan of attacking White's kingside (!), whereas 6.a3 does little in the way of defending it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.83&lt;/ref&gt; Thus if White does not find a clear way to make good use of his move a2–a3, it may turn out to be a waste of tempo.&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.87&lt;/ref&gt;

After 12...Re6 White has to chose a way to react to the oncoming assault:
*13.Nd5 Rh6 14.g3 (to avoid the crushing 14...Qh4) 14...Bh3 15.Re1 when the Nd5 seems excellently placed, supporting the b3–b4 push on the queenside and one jump away from the f4-square where it can cover the weak light squares h3 and g2 if needed. Nevertheless, after 15...c6!? 16.Nf4 Bf5 it may be difficult for White to realise the b3–b4 push and the weakness of the d6-pawn is not of great significance as long as White cannot attack it with his minor pieces, so chances are level.&lt;ref name=&quot;Borik15&quot;&gt;Borik 1986, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; Thus placing the Nc3 in d5 may be premature.
*13.g3 Rh6 14.Ne4 seems crushing as White threatens to win both the Bc5 and the Ne5 (the d6-pawn is pinned). Moreover the Ne4 is well placed to support a later c4–c5 push. Black must react with 14...Qd7 in order to get out of the pin and continue the [[Glossary of chess#Initiative|initiative]]. Now White has to lose a tempo and weaken his kingside further with 15.h4 in order to avoid the terrific threat Qh3–Qxh2#. After 15...Ba7 Black has dynamic equality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Borik15&quot;/&gt;
*13.Na4 is another try for White, hindering Re6–h6 because of Bxe5. Black must switch to defence on the queenside with 13...b6!? 14.Nxc5&amp;nbsp;bxc5 15.f4 (necessary to improve the prospects of the Be2) Nd7 16.Bf3 Rb8 17.Qd3 a4! when Black is even better.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; In this plan it is important that Black does not fear to move his imprisoned Bc5, e.g. 14.Bc3 (threatening 15.b4) 14...Bd7 15.b4? Bxa4 16.Qxa4 axb4.

===The 4...Bc5 line without a2–a3===
''1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Nf3 Bc5 5.e3 Nc6''

In this variation White reasons that the advance a2–a3 is only a loss of time, because Black will play a7–a5 anyway. By refraining from the advance a2-a3 White tries to gain a tempo on the lines of the previous section, to make it more difficult for Black to initiate the Re8–e6–h6 lift. For example after the typical 6.Be2 O-O 7.O-O Re8 8.Nc3 Ngxe5 9.Nxe5 Nxe5 10.b3 d6 11.Bb2 Re6 12.g3 Rh6?! 13.Ne4 Qd7 14.h4 Black does not have the a7-square for his Bc5 because he had no time to play a7–a5.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; As we shall see, however, a rook lift is still one of the best options for Black.

White generally continues with 6.Be2, but can instead try the tricky 6.Nc3. The immediate recapture 6...Ngxe5?! 7.Nxe5 Nxe5 allows 8.f4!&amp;nbsp;Nc6 9.Bd3 when the white bishop is much more actively placed than on e2.&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.74&lt;br&gt;Razuvaev – Bardel, Geneva 1995&lt;/ref&gt; However, simply 6...O-O! 7.Be2 Ngxe5 transposes to the 6.Be2 move-order.

Note that Black should recapture the e5-pawn first with the Ng4, not the Nc6. Lalic analyzes 6.Be2 O-O 7.O-O Ncxe5?! 8.Nd4! (attacking the Ng4), when 8...Nf6 leaves Black without a clear plan and &quot;White can expect an opening advantage&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.83&lt;br&gt;Lovass – Husari, Kecskemet 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, 8...Qh4 gives White a positional advantage with 9.h3 Nh6 10.Nc3 d6 11.Nd5 (&quot;!&quot; Lalic) to bring the knight back to f4 in case of a Black sacrifice in h3.&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.84&lt;br&gt;F. Portisch – Ivan, Zalakaros 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

|White attacks: centre or kingside?}}
After the standard moves '''6.Be2 O-O 7.O-O Re8 8.Nc3 Ngxe5 9.Nxe5 Nxe5''' White has tried two different plans:
* The older fianchettoes the Bc1 and then plays in the centre with moves like Qd1–d5, Nc3–e4 and c4–c5. White attains a huge central space advantage, but Black can attack the kingside with the usual Ra8–a6–h6 rook-lift.
* More recently, White has tried leaving the bishop on c1 for a time, and starting a kingside blitzkrieg with moves like f2–f4, Be2–d3 and Qd1–h5. In this line, Black tries to exploit White's weak pawn on e3.

Instead of the usual 6.Be2 White has also tried developing the queenside first, but it is dangerous to leave White's king in the centre too long. After 6.b3 O-O 7.Bb2 Re8 8.Bd3 (&quot;?!&quot; Lalic) d6 (&quot;!&quot; Lalic) 9.exd6? Nxf2! 10.Kxf2 Rxe3 11.Kf1 Bg4 Black had a crushing attack.&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.84&lt;br&gt;Alexandria – Schnepp, Biel open 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

====White attacks in the centre====
''1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Nf3 Bc5 5.e3 Nc6 6.Be2 O-O 7.O-O Re8 8.Nc3 Ngxe5 9.Nxe5 Nxe5 10.b3''

After '''10.b3 a5''' White can try to capture the Bc5 with 11.Na4 or 11.Ne4, one point being that the retreat 11...Ba7 would lock the Ra8 because Black has not played Ra8–a6 already. Nevertheless, Lalic still thinks 11...Ba7 is the right move after 11.Ne4 due to the importance of the a7–g1 diagonal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lalic79&quot;&gt;Lalic 1998, p.79&lt;/ref&gt; However, Black can also reroute the bishop with 11...Bf8 and &quot;White has no obvious path to even a minute advantage&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lalic79&quot;/&gt; After 11.Na4 Black can also simply react by 11...b6 when the loss of the bishop pair is compensated by the semi-open B-file and the improved control on the central squares.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.19&lt;br&gt;Osnos – Yermolinsky, Leningrad 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Tseitlin considers that after the exchange in c5 Black has the better position.&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.78&lt;/ref&gt; That is why the most common White move is '''11.Bb2''', keeping the knight jumps for later.

Then the most common plan for Black is a rook lift: the plan Ra8–a6–h6 was tried in the much-commented game Åkesson – Tagnon (Berlin Open 1984). Black duly won, but after the game continuation 11...Ra6 12.Qd5! Qe7 13.Ne4 Ba7 14.c5&amp;nbsp;Rg6 15.Rac1 Bb8 16.f4 authors do not agree on which side had the advantage. Borik considers that White had a positional advantage,&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; Tseitlin agrees and recommends 15...Nc6! instead of 15...Bb8, with dangerous threats.&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.80&lt;/ref&gt; However about 15...Bb8 Lalic says &quot;it is true that the bishop pair look a bit pathetic lined up on the back rank just now, but there is no way to stop them breaking out later&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lalic76&quot;&gt;Lalic 1998, p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, after '''11...Ra6''' much depends if White goes for the moves Qd1–d5 and Nc3–e4, or deviates with Nc3–a4:
* After 12.Qd5 several games saw 12...Ba7. A game from Kramnik (playing as Black) saw 13.Ne4 Rae6 14.Ng3 d6 15.Qxa5 Bb6 16.Qc3 Rh6 and &quot;Black has obtained a powerful attacking position in terurn for the pawn sacricice&quot; according to Tseitlin.&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.133&lt;br&gt;Odessky – Kramnik, USSR 1987&lt;/ref&gt; In another game, White varied with 13.Ne4 Rae6 14.c5!?, when Tseitlin recommends the tactical 14...d6 15.cxd6 c6 16.Qd1 f5 17.Bxe5 Rxe5 &quot;with good prospects for Black&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin p.134&lt;br&gt;Gurevich – Korchnoi, Madrid 1988 (rapid)&lt;/ref&gt; Another attempt for White is 13.Ne4 Rae6 14.Qxa5 Bb6 15.Qc3 Qh4, when Tseitlin writes that 16.f4 is &quot;the only move that enables White to organise resistance&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin, p.134&lt;br&gt;Vainerman – Legky, USSR 1986&lt;/ref&gt; while Lalic considers the move dubious, saying &quot;16.Ng3 offers more resistance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.79&lt;br&gt;Whiteley – Agnos, London 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Kasparov presented the line 13.c5 Rh6 14.f4 Qh4 15.h3 as being worth consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Kasparov 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Black had had trouble finding a good square for his attacked knight in a 1988 Yugoslav game, where 14...Nc6 lost quite quickly; hence the try 14...Qh4!?, attacking h2. Also unclear is acceptance of the piece sacrifice with 15.fxe5 Qxh2+ 16.Kf2, when Black obtains definite compensation in a very sharp position.

* Even if 12.Qd5 Ba7 is fully satisfactory for Black, Lalic still considers 12...Qe7 best, and on 15...Bb8 he says &quot;it is true that the bishop pair look a bit pathetic lined up on the back rank just now, but there is no way to stop them breaking out later&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.76&lt;/ref&gt; When White tries a different move-order with 12.Ne4 Ba7 13.Qd5, Black usually opts for 13...Rae6, a promising pawn sacrifice. After the possible 14.Qxa5 Bb6 15.Qc3 Qh4 only 16.f4 enables White to organise resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.82&lt;/ref&gt;

====White attacks on the kingside====
''1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Nf3 Bc5 5.e3 Nc6 6.Be2 O-O 7.O-O Re8 8.Nc3 Ngxe5 9.Nxe5 Nxe5 10.Kh1''

The plan of attacking on the kingside was unveiled by Spassky in a game against Illescas (Linares 1990). Black did not understand immediately White's idea, so that after 10...a5?! 11.f4 Nc6 12.Bd3 d6 13.Qh5 (awarded a &quot;!&quot; by Lalic) 13...h6 14.Rf3 Black's pieces were ill-placed to counter White's attack.&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.132&lt;br&gt;Spassky – Illescas, Linares 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

A more principled plan for Black is to react by an action on the centre, specifically against the backward e3-pawn. After 10...d6 11.f4 Nd7 (&quot;!&quot; Lalic) 12.Bd3 Nf6 13.Qf3 Ng4 14.Nd1 f5 (&quot;!&quot; Lalic) and Black has succeeded in avoiding White's expansion e3–e4.&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.81&lt;br&gt;Alekseev – Bliumberg, Minsk 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 4...Nc6 line===
''1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Nf3 Nc6''

Black plays this when he wants to postpone the placement of its dark-squared bishop. Now White has a wide choice:
*5.Bf4 transposes in the 4.Bf4 variation explained hereafter.
*5.Qd5 transposes in the minor line 4.Qd5 explained hereafter.
*5.e3 and now 5...Bb4+ is not that good because White can react with the simple 5.Bd2. Better for Black is 5...Ngxe5 when Black can go into a kind of King's Indian Defence setup with g7–g6 and Bf8–g7.&lt;ref name=&quot;Borik11&quot;&gt;Borik 1986, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Then the pressure along the a1–h8 diagonal can be enhanced via the quick advance a7–a5–a4–a3. For example after 5.e3 Ngxe5 6.Be2 g6 (&quot;!?&quot; Lalic) 7.O-O Bg7 8.Nc3 O-O 9.Qd2 d6 10.h3 (&quot;?&quot; Lalic) 10...a5 (&quot;!&quot; Lalic) 11.b3 a4 and now 12.Bb2 would have been followed by 12.a3! 13.Bc1 Nxf3+ 14.Bxf3 Qf6 winning the Nc3.&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.90&lt;br&gt;Maurer – Nurkic, Imperia 1990&lt;/ref&gt;
*5.Nc3 will transpose into the 4...Bc5 line if Black plays 5...Bc5, but Black can also wait a bit to see what White is up to, e.g. 5...Ngxe5 6.Nxe5 Nxe5 7.Qc2 Bb4 when both players are still hesitating to castle long or short.&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.91&lt;br&gt;Hebden – Hodgson, Guernsey 1985&lt;/ref&gt;
*5.Bg5 Be7 6.Bxe7 (6.Bf4 Bb4+ transposes in the 4.Bf4 variation) 6...Qxe7 7.Nc3 with the dangerous positional threat Nc3–d5. Here Borik advocates 7...Qc5 8.e3 Ngxe5, when he can react to Qd1–d5 with Qc5–e7 (and the d5-square is no more available to the Nc3), and to Nc3–d5 with Nc6–e7 (to exchange the annoying knight).&lt;ref name=&quot;Borik11&quot;/&gt; Black can also delay the recapture of the e5-pawn with 7...O-O 8.Nd5 Qd8 9.e3&amp;nbsp;Ngxe5 10.Nxe5 Nxe5.&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.92&lt;br&gt;Polugaevsky – Nunn&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the natural 7...Ngxe5 falls into White's positional trap and after 8.Nd5 (&quot;!?&quot; Lalic) 8...Qd8 9.Nxe5&amp;nbsp;Nxe5 10.Qd4 f6 11.f4 Ng6 12.Qe4+ Kf7 White got an edge.&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.94&lt;br&gt;Laketic – Gavric, Yugoslavian team championship 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Once you've checked out my [[User:TDang/Getting_started|getting started]] suggestions, created an account, and have a basic familiarity with WIkibooks, here's things to keep in mind as you edit.

# Keep learning as you go. You will likely pick up the basics of [[w:Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page|wiki editing]] quickly, but there will be a lot of finer points which you don't need right away, but will become helpful later.
# Feel free to work beyond the bounds of the class project. But don't let such extra work suck up '''too much''' of your time.
# Communicate lots. Use the discussion pages to communicate with anyone working on the same material as yourself, or even those working on other material.
# Contribute. [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|Be bold]] in your editing. If you make a mistake, it can be fixed later.
# Behave. Your behavior on Wikibooks is visible to the the entire Internet. Please keep your behavior in mind whether working within or outside the class project. Here are specifics to keep in mind:
## [[Wikibooks:Be_civil|Be civil]] and [[Wikibooks:No_personal_attacks|don't engage in personal attacks]].
## Don't [[Wikibooks:Vandalism|vandalize]] any pages.
## Keep [[Wikibooks:Copyright|copyright]] in mind. More about this below in [[#Plagiarism|Plagiarism]]
## Everything you do is being tracked and can be reviewed later, not just by me, but by anyone. For instance, you can see all the Wikibook edits I've done (including this one) by going to [[Special:Contributions/TDang]].
## If you don't keep these behavior guidelines in mind, there is a chance you can be [[Wikibooks:Administrators#Blocking_users|blocked]] from editing, temporarily or permanently. That would seriously impact your ability to contribute to the class project.

== Plagiarism ==
The rules for contributing to a Wikibook here will be somewhat different than those for a typical school paper. Plagiarism must still be kept in mind, but the application is different.

# The most important thing to keep in mind is respecting [[Wikibooks:copyrights|copyrights]]. Don't copy verbatim (or copy with simple re-wording) copyrighted material from most sources, except for '''small amounts''' of material.
# When you do copy small amounts of material, provide a [[Help:Editing#References|reference]] to the source. (References to facts and ideas drawn from other works are also very helpful.)

There are however, exceptions which are particularly relevant here. The above rules would hold if you were considering including material from [http://www.amazon.com/Intermediate-Microeconomics-Modern-Approach-Eighth/dp/0393934241 out textbook]. However, if you were to draw information from a Wikipedia article (such as [[w:Behavioral economics|behavioral economics]]), you are allowed, if you like, to copy large amounts of material, provided you do so in the right way. If you felt that that page was particularly valuable, you could copy the whole thing into a chapter of the book as a starting point. This wouldn't be violating the copyright because the page is available under a [[w:copyleft|copyleft]] license (specifically the [[Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License|Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0]] license), which gives you the right to do so.

The material from Wikipedia is still copyrighted as well as copylefted, so there's a special way to put it into a wikibook. Instead of just copying the text, you [[WB:RFI|request the page to be imported]]. This gets a little complicated. If you decide you want to do this, communicate with me and we'll figure it out together.

Regardless of the source of your material, this is a '''class''' project, and for the sake of academic honesty, I will want it to be clear when you include external material. If you think it's helpful to creating the book, by all means, copy material which you can legitimately copy. I ask that you make a note of when you do so, however. You can do that by putting a comment in the article's talk page noting where the material originated. Alternatively, you can link to the original source in the [[Using_Wikibooks/How_To_Edit_A_Wikibook#Edit_Summaries|edit summary]].</text>

This wikibook project began in the Fall of 2009, as part of a course in Historical Rhetorics at the [[w:University of South Florida|University of South Florida]] that centers on exploring the various and conflicting definitions of rhetoric throughout classical and modern history. [http://www.marccsantos.com/courses/historical_f2011/historical_2011.html The course will be offered again in the Fall of 2011], and this project will receive some much needed attention. Over the course of the semester, we hope to expand upon the lecture notes already here, create individual pages for relevant secondary sources, and add more sources to the project. This page should maintain a neutral point of view (in accordance with Wikibooks' core [[policy]]). 

The dominant definition of rhetoric stems from Aristotle: &quot;let rhetoric be an ability, in each case, to see the available means of persuasion.&quot; While the idea of persuasion has a powerful place in the history of rhetoric, it differs significantly from [[w:Sophism|sophism]] and the Roman, and Christian conceptions of rhetoric. Thus, this course will attempt to place the definition of &quot;persuasion&quot; alongside other conceptualizations of rhetoric's purpose. Further, the course's concluding examinations of Ramus, Petrarch, Blair, Campbell, and Whatley will address how and why critical appreciation for epistemic rhetoric sharply declines as the Enlightenment and Italian Humanism rise.  

Graduate students participating in the Fall 2011 course will be required to compile annotated bibliographies on important secondary articles. Those annotations will be transformed into pages for this wiki. My long term goal is to make this a sustainable resource for other graduate and undergraduate courses covering the history of rhetoric. Please forgive any omissions in the secondary sources listed below. For the first semester running this project, I have chosen to emphasize journal articles instead of either complete books or chapters in anthologies. Feel free to add articles to pages as suggestions for future research. 

As the semester rolls on, I hope that students will come back to this page and create links to their brief summaries of significant articles (and &quot;hope&quot; should be heard in that professorial tone of &quot;I hope they also will consider handing in their final paper and attending every class session&quot;).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello Wikimedia community. I am new to the wiki-experience, but am authentically trying to incorporate this technology into my teaching. I had the idea on a wikibook focuing on rhetoric because: 1) most coverage on rhetoric tends to be overly Aristotelian in its POV, and that the discipline of Rhetoric could itself use a kind of digital database for secondary sources. Folding these two needs together into one wikibook seems to make sense to me.

}}

This is called the &quot;Rubinstein variation&quot; in reference to the famous game Rubinstein – Vidmar (Berlin 1918) where the move 4.Bf4 was first employed.&lt;ref&gt;Moskalenko 2007, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; The move 4.Bf4 first aims to be able to answer 4...Bc5 with 5.e3 without blocking the Bc1, contrary to what happens in the Adler line 4.Nf3. On the other hand, the early development of the bishop means that White is slightly exposed to a Bb4+. 

Also, in the Adler line White faces the risk of a strong attack against his kingside, while in the 4.Bf4 variation this is seldom the case because White's Bf4 is well placed to protect White's kingside if needed. However in some cases the Bf4 can become slightly exposed (e.g. some variations of the Rubinstein line when Black plays g7–g5 and h7–h5).

Apart from the sideline [[/4...g5|4...g5]], the main line continues with both camps developing their pieces around the e5-pawn with 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ (preparing 6...Qe7) when White has an important choice to make between the two moves [[/4...Nc6/5. Nf3/5...Bb4+/6. Nc3|6.Nc3]] and 6.Nbd2, each leading to extremely different play. With 6.Nc3 White accepts to have his pawn structure on the queenside ruined, in return for a material advantage of one pawn, the bishop pair and active play in the center. 

On the other hand, with 6.Nbd2 White gives back the gambited pawn in order to keep a healthy pawn structure and to get the bishop pair. After 6...Qe7 White generally plays 7.a3 in order to force the immediate exchange of the Bb4 for the Nd2 and get the bishop pair, a space advantage and a minority attack on the queenside. White can also try 7.e3 which tries to win a tempo over the 7.a3 variation but may end up with the Bb4/Nd2 exchange made in less favorable circumstances, or not made at all. The maverick gambit 6...f6 or 6...d6 also exist.&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.126&lt;br&gt;Rubinstein – Tartakower, Kissingen 1928&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
This variation is named after Alexander Alekhine probably thanks to his wins in the games Alekhine – Rabinovic (Baden Baden, 1925) and Alekhine – Seitz (Hastings, 1926).&lt;ref name=&quot;Oleinikov4&quot;&gt;Oleinikov chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; Alekhine himself stated:&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Tseitlin 1992, p.21, without references&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This is considered with good reason to be White's best system against the Budapest Gambit. White hands the pawn back, but in return gains control of d5. Over the next few moves, however, he has to play with extreme precision, since otherwise his central pawn position may become the object of a successful attack by Black.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

White does not try to keep its material advantage (the e5-pawn) and concentrates on building a strong pawn centre, in order to get a space advantage. Notably a controversial point is whether the typical black manoeuvre Bf8–b4–xc3 is advantageous for Black (as it saddles White with doubled pawns) or for White (as it reinforces his centre). Lalic thinks both, considering 6...Bb4+ to be a bad move after 4...Nxe5 5.f4 Nec6 6.Nf3,&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.105&lt;/ref&gt; but a good one after 4...Nxe5 5.f4 Nec6 6.Be3.&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.111&lt;/ref&gt;

After 4.e4 Black has to do something about its Ng4 that is attacked by the Qd1. Apart from the main line, two minor variations have been tried:
* with 4...h5?! Black does not want to get its gambit pawn back, and prefers to keep the Ng4 on its aggressive position. Thus White has to be careful not to fall in some traps like 5.Nf3?&amp;nbsp;Bc5 or 5.f4?! Bc5 6.Nh3 Nc6 7.Be2? Qh4+.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; White does best to repel immediately the Ng4 with 5.Be2, after which the move h7–h5 is only a weakness and White has the advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.36&lt;br&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.24&lt;br&gt;Ahues – Helling, Berlin 1932–33&lt;br&gt;Golombek – Tartakower, Birmingham 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

* with 4...d6?! Black continues in true gambit style, trying to develop rapidly its pieces, but the compensations are not sufficient. Here again, after 5.exd6 Bxd6 White needs to avoid some traps like 6.Nf3? Bc5! 7.Qxd8+ Kxd8 when Black regains the pawn with advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.37&lt;/ref&gt; White continues with 6.Be2 to gain a tempo on the Ng4 when Black's only option to sustain an initiative is 6...f5 7.exf5 Qe7. Then White has a choice between chasing a slight positional advantage with 8.Nf3,&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.41&lt;br&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.112&lt;br&gt;Capablanca – Tartakower, Bad Kissingen 1928&lt;/ref&gt; or taking a piece with 8.c5! Bxc5 9.Qa4+ Nc6 10.Qxg4. In the later case, Savielly Tartakower and Max Euwe initially considered Black had enough compensation but more recent analysis proved them wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.41&lt;br&gt;Egli – Bauer, Correspondence 1931&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

The main line is 4...Nxe5 5.f4 when Black has an important choice to make about where to move its Ne5:
* 5...Nec6 is considered to be the best&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.47, citing the IMs Harry Schlüsser and Tom Wedberg&lt;/ref&gt;
* 5...Ng6 is probably playable&lt;ref name=&quot;Borik46&quot;&gt;Borik 1986, p.46&lt;/ref&gt;
* 5...Nbc6? 6.fxe5 Qh4+, despite being called &quot;highly regarded&quot; by Lalic, is just a bad piece sacrifice with Black hoping for something like 7.g3? Qe4+ that wins a rook. As advocated by John Nunn White can keep the material advantage with the funny 7.Kd2 Qf4+ 8.Kc3 Qxe5+ 9.Kd2 Qf4+ 10.Ke1 Qxe4+ 11.Qe2 when the black queen is pinned.

''1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.e4 Nxe5 5.f4 Nec6''

The Knight on c6 is safer than on g6, and can be part of a general strategy on the dark squares. It can go on d4 while the other Knight can go on c5 via a6 or d7.

After 6.Nf3 Bc5 White has difficulties to castle short, because the plan to exchange the dark-squared bishops with Bd3/Qe2/Be3 can be met by Bg4/Nd4 in order to muddy the waters.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.47&lt;br&gt;Vaganian – Wedberg, Buenos Aires Olympiad 1978&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, as Lalic points out:&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.104&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;White can no longer castle kingside and will usually have to go the other way. However, this is rather slow and gives Black time to try and undermine the white centre. To this end Bc8–g4 often comes in handy, in order to pin the white knight on f3 against the white queen. Note that Black should wait until his opponent has wasted a tempo with Qe2.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A possible continuation is 6.Nf3 Bc5 7.Nc3 d6 8.f5!? Nd7 9.Bg5 f6 10.Bf4 and here Black has to prepare the exchange of the Bc5 against the Nc3 with 10...Bb4!,&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.105&lt;br&gt;Cuartas – O'Kelly, Havana olympiad 1966&lt;/ref&gt; because a White knight on the d5-square would be too strong now that it cannot be challenged by Bc8–e6 and it can continue with Nd5–f4–e6 in the long run. A slower course of action is 6.Nf3 Bc5 7.Nc3 d6 8.Bd3 O-O 9.Qe2 Bg4! 10.Be3 Na6 11.O-O-O f6 with a typical game of opposite castles.&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.106&lt;br&gt;Novikov – Contin, Amantea 1991&lt;br&gt;Baltus – van Haastert, Dieren 1991&lt;/ref&gt; White cannot, however, afford the luxury of being too slow, e.g. after 6.Nf3 Bc5 7.Nc3 d6 8.Bd3 O-O 9.h3?! Re8 it is already time for White to seek a simplification with 10.Qe2 Nd4 11.Nxd4 Bxd4 12.Be3 Qh4+ 13.Qf2,&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.108&lt;br&gt;Gelpke – Piket&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise Black would soon have strong pressure in the centre thanks to the semi-open e-file.

Another try is 6.a3 but it creates a significant weakness in b3 and it is rather slow. For example after the possible 6...a5 7.Be3 Na6 8.Bd3 Bc5 9.Qd2 d6 10.Nf3 O-O 11.Nc3 Bxe3 12.Qxe3 Nc5 13.O-O Re8 14.Bc2 a4 Borik has shown that the possibility to attack the c4-pawn with Be6/Na5 gives sufficient play to Black.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.50&lt;br&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.28&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that Black is not compelled to reply to 6.a3 with 6...a5, and can also treat a2–a3 as a mere loss of tempo by switching to another development like d6/g6/Bg7/O-O with equality.&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.29, citing Steiner&lt;/ref&gt; As Lalic puts it:&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.114&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[I] believe that Black should now opt for the plan of fianchettoing his dark-squared bishop. The black bishop will be excellently posted on g7 and Black's kingside will also be more robust against White's eventual kingside attack. Psychologically, if White has 'all the time in the world' for such moves as 6.a3, it makes sense to divert the bishop to another diagonal instead of 'respecting' White's move with 6...a5.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

White has also experimented a plan with a quick queen raid on the kingside, involving moves like Nc3/Qh5/Bd3/Nd5. This plan was first tried in a game of Alekhine against Gilg  and after 6.a3 a5 7.Nc3 Bc5 8.Nd5 O-O 9.Bd3 d6 10.Qh5 Nd7? 11.Nf3 h6 12.b4! 12...axb4 13.Bb2 bxa3 14.Bc3 White has a strong initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.117&lt;br&gt;Alekhine – Gilg, Semmering 1926&lt;/ref&gt; One year later Gilg was playing White and tried to repeat Alekhine's success in a game against Vajda, but the latter improved with 10...Nd4! and won.&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.117&lt;br&gt;Gilg – Vajda, Kecskemet 1927&lt;/ref&gt; This plan can also be tried without the advance a2–a3, e.g. 6.Nc3 Bc5 7.Qh5 d6 8.Bd3 Nd7 9.Nf3 Nf6 10.Qh4 and here Lalic recommends 10...O-O.&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.116&lt;br&gt;Maksimenko – Nielsen, Aalborg 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

|After 6.Be3}}
''1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.e4 Nxe5 5.f4 Nec6 6.Be3''

The continuation '''6.Be3''' controls the a7–g1 diagonal, takes the good c5-square from the Bf8, and is considered to be the best reply.&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.110&lt;/ref&gt; If Black wants to contest that he can try 6...Na6 to continue with 7...Nc5,&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.118&lt;br&gt;Rudakovsky – Ratner, Moscow 1945&lt;/ref&gt; but most of the games continue with '''6...Bb4+'''. Here the best reply for White is controversial. While Borik does not express a preference, Alekhine strongly recommends 7.Nc3 (awarded a &quot;!&quot;):&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.119&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Much stronger than 7.Nd2, for with the knight threatening to jump to d5, Black will sooner or later be forced to exchange his important dark-squared bishop for it. The doubling of the c-pawns in these circumstances is not something White should fear.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Tseitlin agrees, stating that &quot;after 7.Nd2 Black has no difficulty at all&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Lalic thinks 7.Nd2 (awarded a &quot;!&quot;) is more accurate:&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.111&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;White avoids the doubled c-pawns that are likely to occur after 7.Nc3, and this knight can latter be deployed via the b3-square. The Russian grandmaster Rustem Dautov [...] is the maestro of this variation with many impressive victories under his belt.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Actually Tseitlin's opinion on 7.Nd2 is based on the game Nikolić – Lev (Groningen 1985–86), which continued 7...Qe7 8.a3 (&quot;?&quot; Tseitlin) 8...Qxe4+ (&quot;!&quot; Tseitlin) 9.Qf3 Bxd2+ 10.Kxd2 Qxf3 and White is a pawn up.&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; But what Tseitlin considers a white blunder is called a gambit by Lalic, who gives 7.Nd2 Qe7 8.a3 (&quot;!&quot; Lalic) 8...Qxe4 (&quot;it is probably wise to decline the gambit&quot;, Lalic) 9.Kf2 Bxd2 10.Qxd2 O-O 11.Nf3 d6 12.Re1 Qf5 13.Bd3 Qa5 14.b4 Qh5 and White won.&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.112&lt;br&gt;Potocnik – G.Hofmann, Bled 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

After 7.Nc3 Black has the interesting zwischenzug 7...Qh4+ (&quot;!&quot; Borik) 8.g3 Bxc3+ 9.bxc3 Qe7 so that the diagonal a8–h1 is weakened before Black places his Bc8 on the b7-square. The queen on the e7-square is well placed to pressure the e4-pawn. However, as all Black's pieces are on the queenside, continuing with pawn pushes like f7–f5 is probably too weakening, as Alekhine demonstrated in his game against Seitz in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.51&lt;br&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.119&lt;br&gt;Alekhine – Seitz, Hastings 1925–26&lt;/ref&gt; So Black does best to attack with pieces, possibly with the setup b6/Nc5/Bb7/O-O-O.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.53&lt;br&gt;Keres – Gilg, Prague 1937&lt;/ref&gt; In that case Tseitlin considers that with a knight on c5 the move d7–d6 should be avoided if Black has to respond to the capture Bxc5 by dxc5, because the white pawns in e4 and f4 would have too much leeway.&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

After 7.Nd2 the pressure on the e4-pawn with 7...Qe7 does not live long after 8.a3 Bc5 9.Bxc5 Qxc5 10.Qf3 and now 10...Nd4 would be premature so that Lalic recommends 10...a5.&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.112&lt;br&gt;Dautov – Blatny, Bad Worishofen 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the intermediate 7...Qh4+ 8.g3 Qe7 does not change the picture for Lalic, as after 9.Bg2 Na6 10.a3 Bc5 11.Bxc5 Nxc5 12.b4 Ne6 the bishop was well placed in g2 and Black experienced difficulties to develop his own Bc8.&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.111&lt;br&gt;Dautov - Haas, Buehl 1992&lt;/ref&gt; But Lalic does not mention the game Pomar – Heidenfeld cited by Borik, in which Black played the advance a7–a5 to avoid the white advance b2–b4, hence reaching equality after 9.Bg2 a5 10.Ne2 Na6 11.O-O d6 12.Nb3 Bg4 13.h3 Bxe2 14.Qxe2 a4.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.50&lt;br&gt;Pomar – Heidenfeld, Enschede 1963&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he recommends 7...d6 8.Nf3 O-O 9.Bd3 and now the same development as in Pomar's game:&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.113&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;9...a5 and 10...Na6 deserves attention, when White's movements on the queenside are more restricted and the black knight will be able to settle on the c5-square without being kicked by the thematic b2–b4. It may appear that we have reached the same position elaborated in previous games a tempo down for Black, since he has committed hi bishop to b4 and will later drop back to the c5-square instead of heading there at once. However, the white knight is less actively placed on d2 and in fact this fully compensates Black for the slight loss of time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

|After 5.f4 Ng6}}
''1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.e4 Nxe5 5.f4 Ng6''

The Knight on g6 puts the f4-pawn under pressure, but may be embarrassed and lose a tempo if White pushes f4–f5. Now 6.a3, an attempt to take all squares from the Bb8 by continuing with b2–b4 or Bc1–e3, does not work that fine after 6...Bc5! 7.b4?! Bxg1! 8.Rxg1 O-O! 9.Qf3 d6 10.g4 a5 11.b5 Nd7 12.Ra2 Nc5 when Black's superior pawn structure and well-positioned Nc5 gives him the advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.123&lt;br&gt;Mechkarov – Atanasov, correspondence 1955&lt;/ref&gt; That leaves White with the choice between 6.Nf3 and 6.Be3.

The move 6.Nf3 controls the e5-square in order to prepare the push f4–f5. Unlike after 5...Nec6, White does not have to fear 6...Bc5?!, which runs into difficulties after 7.f5! Nh4 8.Ng5!, when the Black knight is already in danger of being lost to Qd1–g4 or Qd1–h5.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.43&lt;br&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.120&lt;br&gt;Alekhine – Rabinovich, Baden-Baden 1925&lt;br&gt;Borik wrongly attributes the black pieces to Seitz in his book, while Tseitlin and Lalic rightly note the Black player was actually Rabinovich.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Black must react quickly with 6...Bb4+ 7.Nc3 when he can adopt a normal setup with d6/O-O/Nc6/b6 or act boldly with 7...Qf6 threatening both the Nc3 and the f4-pawn.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.45&lt;br&gt;Chebotayev – Isayev, USSR 1948&lt;/ref&gt; One point in favour of 7...Qf6 is that after 8.e5 Qb6 the black queen prevents White to castle short and is well placed if White castles long.&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

The move 6.Be3 takes the a7–g1 diagonal from Black's Bf8 and may in some lines prepare the long castle. After the mandatory 6...Bb4+, during several moves Black will have the choice between aggressive and quiet continuations:
* White can opt for 7.Nd2 to avoid having doubled pawns, but he must be prepared to sacrifice a pawn after 7...Qe7 8.Kf2!? Bxd2 9.Qxd2 Qxe4 10.Bd3 with piece activity for the pawn deficit,&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.120&lt;/ref&gt; because the normal defense 8.Bd3? runs into 8...Qd6! and both the Bd3 and the f4-pawn are attacked.&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.120&lt;br&gt;Lorscheid – Dunnington&lt;/ref&gt; 
* White does not need, however, to bother about the doubled pawns and after 7.Nc3 Bxc3+ 8.bxc3 Black can choose the quiet 8...b6!? followed with a normal development like d6/O-O/Bb7/Nd7/Re8/Nc5.&lt;ref name=&quot;Borik46&quot;/&gt; 
* An ultra-aggressive continuation for Black is 7.Nc3 Bxc3+ 8.bxc3 Qe7 9.Bd3 f5!? 10.Qc2 fxe4 11.Bxe4 when Black can free his play with the pseudo-sacrifice 11...Nxf4 12.Bxf4 d5 13.cxd5 Bf5 regaining the piece.&lt;ref name=&quot;Borik46&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.36&lt;/ref&gt; Lalic continues this line by 14.Qa4+ b5! 15.Qxb5+ c6 &quot;with great complications&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.122&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lalic proposes Black with a middle way, after 7.Nc3 Bxc3+ 8.bxc3 Qe7 9.Bd3 O-O 10.Qd2 and only now that Black has his king safe shall he unleash 10...f5!?, when &quot;it is not so easy for White to meet [10...f5] as the two main responses, 11.e5 and 11.exf5, allow Black promising chances with 11...d6 and 11...Nxf4 respectively&quot;.

'''TLDR:''' There's a lot of guidance to be found on how to edit Wikibooks, how to behave, and so forth. I will link to some of that guidance, and it can be very useful. It's not strictly required reading for the class, however. The pages I write here for class '''are required reading'''.

Please start by reading my [[User:TDang/Getting started|getting started]] suggestions.

Once you've gone through that, read suggestions for [[User:TDang/Class editing|continuing to edit]].

Here's some [[User:TDang/tips on citations|tips on citations]].

&lt;!-- Here's [[User:TDang/reviewing others work|guidelines for midterm reviews]]. --&gt;
=== Lecture notes ===
Here I'll be posting '''very rough''' versions of my lecture notes. You should not expect these to be useful enough for studying--there are other resources for that. However, by posting these here I make them accessible for use under Wikibooks-appropriate licenses. That means anything posted here, you can copy and modify for inclusion in a Wikibook.

There will be some aspects of my lecture notes which I don't include here. For some things, that will be deliberate and I won't post them here. For other things, that will just be me avoiding unnecessary effort. Particularly, I am not including graphs here. If there are graphs you feel are needed, there's a good chance you can re-create those graphs yourself without worrying about licensing. If you are concerned about a particular graph, ask me about it and I'll either let you know you're safe to re-create it yourself, or if necessary I can upload a version of the graph to [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page Wikimedia Commons], and you will be able to use it from there.

Remember there is another standard as well, which is academic integrity. If you copy material from here (or from any other source which you can legitimately copy from based on the licensing) make sure you credit your source.

      <comment>/* Deletion of rotational kinematics */ new section</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Not sure if it's a big misunderstanding, but this page seems to have more than enough errors.  For starters, it said:
&quot;T = v/2πR&quot; -- how can time increase with increased velocity??  And that's the first equation on the page, set off in a big box.  I thought it was a typo, so I corrected it.  And then it said: &quot;Any object travel on a circle will return to its original starting point . At this point the object travels a distance 2 .&quot;  Ignoring the grammatical mistake (should be &quot;travels&quot; in the first sentence), how can an object in a circle travel a rational distance when pi is irrational?

Hmm, thinking about it now, someone probably tried to put in the &quot;pi&quot; character after &quot;2&quot;, to make &quot;2pi&quot; but it didn't take.  So that means someone didn't preview properly.  Anyway, after that, I stopped bothering to look.  [[User:Wiki88V|Wiki88V]] ([[User talk:Wiki88V|talk]]) 21:21, 21 August 2009 (UTC)

I have edited the formulae to resolve the issues that were pointed out. [[User:Nalberding|Nalberding]] ([[User talk:Nalberding|talk]]) 18:15, 16 October 2009 (UTC)

Rotational Kinematics concerns with the description of spinning bodies.  The orientation of any object can be described by three angular quantities called the Euler angles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} [[Category:Squid recipes]] [[Category:Fried recipes]]

== Ingredients ==
* 1 pound squid, tubes and tentacles
* 1 egg, beaten
* 1 cup iced lemon juice
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* Cornmeal
* 3 tbs salt
* 3 tbs freshly ground black pepper
* 2 quarts peanut or safflower oil
* 1 tbs chopped parsley
* 1 1/2 tsp minced garlic


== Procedure ==
#Rinse the squid thoroughly and pat dry. Cut the tentacles in half lengthwise and the tubes into 1/2-inch rings. Set aside.
#Combine parsley, garlic, salt, pepper, eggs, flour, and lemon juice. Pour into a large bowl.
#Dredge squid pieces in cornmeal, then wet mixture, then again in cornmeal. Set aside.
#Heat oil in a deep-fryer or cast iron Dutch oven to 400 degrees F. Add squid, 4 at a time, and cook 45 seconds to a minute. Drain on a wire rack and repeat with remaining squid.
#Sprinkle calamari with some more kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, and serve. 

== Notes ==

A lot of recipes for calamari call to marinate the squid in an acidic liquid to tenderize them. However, this wouldn't work even if you let it sit for years. See, marinades only penetrate about, at most, 1/4 inch. That isn't far enough to get to the tough connective tissues deep in the center. So throw away all those recipes that call to &quot;tenderize&quot; with acid, and just cook squid either very, very fast, or very, very long.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} [[Category:Chicken recipes]] [[Category:Southern recipes]] [[Category:Sauce recipes]]

== Ingredients ==
* 2 cups low-fat buttermilk
* 1 (4-pound) broiler/fryer chicken, cut into individual parts and wings discarded
* 1/4 cup paprika
* 3 tbs salt
* 3 tbs freshly ground black pepper
* 3 tbs lemon pepper
* Flour
* 2 tbs cayenne pepper
* Vegetable shortening
'''Country Gravy'''
* 1 cup chicken broth
* 1 cup whole milk, mixed with 1/4 cup heavy cream
* 2 tbs all-purpose flour
* 1 tbs freshly ground black pepper

== Procedure==
#Combine seasonings for chicken and buttermilk in a large container. Add chicken, toss to coat, and refrigerate overnight to a day.
#Drain chicken in a colander and dredge in flour. Set aside 2-3 minutes.
#Heat enough shortening in a 12 inch cast-iron skillet to 325 degrees F. Add thighs to the center, and breasts and legs to the outer part. Fry 10-12 minutes on each side or until golden brown and internal temperature of thighs is 180 degrees F.
#Remove from pan and drain on a cooling rack. Cover loosely with foil and set aside.
#Pour out all fat except 2 tbs from pan and place over medium high heat. Add all-purpose flour to pan and whisk continuously until mixture turns blond.
#Deglaze pan with broth and whisk continuously until liquid has reduced by 2/3.
#Add milk mixture and pepper; bring to a boil. Cook, whisking occasionally, until liquid has reduced to 1 cup and is thickened. If gravy is too thick, add 1/4 cup milk at a time.
#Serve chicken smothered with cream gravy.

== Notes ==

Resist the urge to drain on paper towels or brown paper bags. There is logic to using a cooling rack instead of these. See, the paper absorbs the oil, and instead of moving it away, it holds it up right against the food, thus making it greasy.

Don't try to put the chicken into a warm oven while you make the gravy. Since they are encased in that starch, they will stay warm a good 20 minutes. And if you have a gas oven, especially don't.</text>

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:55, 21 August 2009 (UTC)

:Thanks. Yep, and it's possible that that snippet was small enough to be quoted as fair use anyway. But for the time being, the simple route was to pull it. Maybe I (or someone else) will mine the link for material later. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 01:47, 6 December 2009 (UTC)

:A! Don't I wish I wanted to participate! In fact, I'm totally overwhelmed with semester-end, and can't allocate brain to other things other than the occasional walk. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TDang|contribs]]) 01:29, 2 May 2012 (UTC)</text>

This page overviews '''how to type''' in the Cyrillic alphabet, which is used in the Russian language.

===Stuck in a lab/cafe/library?===

Even if you have no administrator access, you can still type in Cyrillic! It might not be ideal, but it will do in a pinch.

Please see the excellent 'Virtual Keyboard for Russian and Ukranian' by Paul Gorodyansky. Google for it, or try here: [http://WinRus.com/screen_e.htm http://WinRus.com/screen_e.htm]

===Ubuntu 9.04===

====Step 1 add the keyboard layout indicator applet to the panel ====

*Right click on the main panel, somewhere where it is empty and gray.
** (ie, move the mouse all the way to the top left hand corner of the screen, right click)
*click 'add to panel'
*choose the 'keyboard indicator' applet
*You should see a new panel applet, with something like 'USA' printed on it.
*Right click the 'USA'
*Go to Keyboard Preferences
*Click Layouts
*Click Add

====Step 2 choose a layout ====

*You can search under Russian Language, there are several options. 

*If you have a US/English keyboard, you might like the 'USA Phonetic Russian' layout. You can only find this by looking under English language or United States as a country. 

*Add it

*Now, you should be able to switch your layout by left-clicking on the applet.

**It should switch from saying USA to Rus or USA to USA2. 
**Try clicking it, and typing in cyrillic. 

==== Step 4 tweaking ====

*If you want to switch layout via keyboard---
**Right click on the applet
**Go to keyboard preferences
**Layouts
**Layout Options
**Keys to switch layout

*If you are using the USA Russian Phonetic layout you can use a 'level 3' key to instantly let you type punctuation and other normal US-english characters. Look under layout options/keys for level 3.

*Alternative: You can also use SCIM

===KDE===
''Note:'' the X server configuration (see [[#XFree86]] below) may conflict with KDE settings if you change both.

Make sure you have Russian i18n installed. Go to Regional &amp; Accessibility - Keyboard Layout in the KDE Control Center. Add the Russian layout to your active layouts. You might want to choose the phonetic Layout variant (yawerty, or яверты). With the flag icon in your taskbar you can now switch between different layouts.

Many letters now are where you expect them to be (for example s - с, p - п, g - г), but some others are harder to find:
* ` ю
* = ч
* [ ш
* ] щ
* \ э
* # ё (shift 3)
* $ Ё (shift 4)


===Mac OS X===

You don't need to install any software or fonts, but you do need to add Russian to your computer's list of languages.

Open System Preferences from the Dock and click on 'International'.

There you will find a tab called 'Languages' containing a list which may already include Russian.  If it isn't there, click 'Edit List' and add it.  

Don't put Russian at the top of your list unless you want to start using Russian date styles or list attributes in all of your applications.

Another tab called 'Input Menu' in the same place will allow you to choose a keyboard layout such as Cyrillic or Phonetic.

Then you can switch keyboard layouts and languages at any time using the flag icon in the top-right of the screen.


===Windows===
[[Image:KB_Eng-Rus_QWERTY(ЙЦУКЕН).svg|400px|right]]

Instructions follow for adding a traditional Russian keyboard layout for Windows, however many may prefer to use a phonetic Russian keyboard layout.  The setup is slightly more involved as the user must either create or use an existing third party keyboard layout.  One way to set up common versions of Windows with a phonetic Russian layout is to follow Paul Gorodyansky's instructions on his &quot;Russification&quot; site using files he has created for this purpose.  The relevant English language page is http://winrus.com/kbd_e.htm.

====For Windows 2000:====
# Click the &lt;i&gt;Start&lt;/i&gt; button.&lt;br&gt;
# Go to &lt;i&gt;Settings&lt;/i&gt;...&lt;i&gt;Control Panel&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
# Double-click &lt;i&gt;Keyboard&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
# Click the &lt;i&gt;Input Locales&lt;/i&gt; tab.&lt;br&gt;
# Click the &lt;i&gt;Change...&lt;/i&gt; button to bring up the Text Services window.&lt;br&gt;
# Under Installed Services, click &lt;i&gt;Add...&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
# In the drop-down list of input languages, select &lt;i&gt;Russian&lt;/i&gt; and click &lt;i&gt;OK&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
# If you would like to change between keyboard inputs without going through the Control Panel each time, click the &lt;i&gt;Language Bar&lt;/i&gt; button under Preferences in the Text Services window. Next select to &lt;i&gt;Show the Language Bar on the Desktop&lt;/i&gt; and click &lt;i&gt;OK&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
# To exit, click &lt;i&gt;OK&lt;/i&gt; in the Text Services window and in the Keyboard Properties window.

If you don't see &quot;Russian&quot; in the list:
# Go back to ''Control Panel''.
# Double-click ''Regional Options''
# Under ''Language Settings for the system'' check off ''Cyrillic''
# Click ''OK''
Note: You might need Windows 2000 CD&gt;

Better to check ''Cyrillic'' off during installation of Windows.

==== Windows XP ====

To set up the keyboard for Cyrillic Russian/Ukraine in Windows XP
# click on 'Start'
# Go to 'Control Panel'
# Click 'Regional &amp; Language Options'
# Click 'Language' tab
# Click 'Settings'
# Add 'Russian'
# Click 'Apply' and then 'OK'

====Windows Vista &lt;br/&gt;====
To add the Cyrillic keyboard for use on your computer:
# Click on the windows logo in the bottom left hand corner
# Click the Control Panel button (or clickable text if you have it set that way)
* For ease of finding this, press in the left pane &quot;Switch to classic view&quot;
# Now select Regional and Language Options
# Click on the Keyboards and Languages tab
# Press Change Keyboards
* A window should appear that lists all the installed languages to your computer. This window should be called Text Services and Input Languages
# Press Add...
# Now scroll down to where it says Russian (Russia)
# Expand that menu by pressing the +
* If the dropdown menu Keyboard isn't already expaneded, press that too
# Now checkbox Russian and press OK, and then Apply.
* If this is the first language you've added to this computer, a small icon near your taskbar that says &quot;EN&quot; should appear, to change the input language to Russian for whatever window you have opened, press it and select RU.
* Please note, every time you change windows (say from an IM window to your browser) it will keep your language setting on the previous window, and the new one will be set to use your default input language, which is most likely EN.
Keyboard icon wil show on taskbar. Left click to toggle between English and Russian.

As an added help, apply keyboard stickers for Cyrillic Russian/Ukraine.  You can find them on e-Bay, under 'stickers, Keyboard, under Computer/Networking. They are available in several
colors and are quite reasonable.

===XFree86===

XFree86 4.3 may be configured for Russian keyboard layout in the Keyboard &lt;code&gt;InputDevice&lt;/code&gt; section of the configuration file (typically &lt;code&gt;/etc/X11/XF86Config&lt;/code&gt;).  Add the following two lines to that section:

&lt;pre&gt;
        Option          &quot;XkbLayout&quot;     &quot;us,ru&quot;
        Option          &quot;XkbOptions&quot;    &quot;grp:shift_toggle&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

This arrangement will allow you to switch between US and Russian layouts by pressing the shift keys together.  Note that this configuration is independent of the desktop environment (GNOME, KDE) or window manager (sawfish, metacity, kwin) in use, and might conflict with it if you change both.

=== X.Org ===
Same as [[#XFree86|XFree86]], but the configuration file is called “xorg.conf”.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">===What this Book Covers===
This book covers writing a 2D game in Linux from start to finish.  It starts with setting up the build environment for various distributions, and ends with packaging the game for distribution.  It also includes creating tools to make creating the game easier.  Sprite and level editors for instance.  The game itself will be written in SDL 1.2 and use ALSA for audio.  We'll primarily cover SDL 1.2, which is probably the most commonly used flavor of SDL out there right now, and briefly cover its successor SDL 1.3.  (If SDL 1.3 becomes more prevalent, we may make the transition wholly to that library.)  The level editors and other helper tools will largely be written in Qt4.  Sample algorithms may be demonstrated first by simply printing to stdout where applicable for simplicity's sake.

Linux is available on a plethora of environments, so this book will also cover porting code from the original environment, in this case an AMD64 based PC, to other environments.  The two primary target environments will be the F-200 and the Pandora.  Both are ARM based hand-helds, but with very different capabilities, input schemes, and screen resolutions.  We'll cover aspects of porting from one environment to another, including control scheme, screen resolution and aspect ratio, and programming considerations.

It will also briefly cover level design considerations, both when dealing with aspect ratio, and when transitioning from an arcade environment to a PC, and to a console.

===What this Book Doesn't Cover===
This is a programming book, a how to guide for the creation of the code and levels behind a 2D Linux game.  It doesn't cover managing your programming team, or suggest ideas for games other than the one that's created in the text of this book.  It doesn't delve into marketing of the game.

===Languages and Libraries Used in this Book===
The code in this book is written in C++.  It uses the libraries SDL, Qt4, and ALSA.

===Who This Book is Intended For===
This book is intended for those who who want to have fun programming games in Linux!  It doesn't assume an extensive background in C++ programming, though a basic grasp of the C++ language is required.  Language fundamentals are reviewed as those topics are reached while programming the game, but as a fundamental C++ primer this would present the language in an incomplete and haphazard fashion.  There are many good C++ Primers that cover the language in a coherent and comprehensive fashion that would be better suited to teaching the student C++.

Some of the concepts covered in this text are complex.  Where that's the case this book will cover the concept in a step by step fashion.  It is intended to guide those who've been exposed to C++ but may not have a huge experience with the language, and may not have any experience with game programming at all.  Experienced programmers may find utility in this book as a reference to topics that are scarcely covered in other texts, though they may find the detail we go into in this book exhaustive.

===The Target Game===
The end goal of this book is to walk the student through programming and packaging a fully fledged 2D platforming and side scrolling game.  Super Mario Brothers is often thought of as the epitome of this genre.  Our game, &quot;A Ragamuffin's Destiny&quot; will follow the concepts laid out in those and other good platforming games, while introducing a few twists of our own.  All the sprites in this initial game will be low resolution.  Most the concepts should translate well to higher resolution 2D games.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The First World War was a tragedy that left over twenty million dead and planted the seeds for the Second World War two decades later. It marked the end of what seemed to be the gilded industrial age of European empires and replaced it with a new era of struggling republics in eastern Europe and the creation of the Soviet Union.  While it is obvious that the world was changed dramatically by the war, the causes of the conflict are confusing and form a line of deadly dominoes that only become apparent after the assassination of Austria-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Bosnia on June 28, 1914.  


== European Alliances ==


The main factor behind the evolution of events that led to World War One was the system of European alliances that developed in the decades before the conflict. Following the Franco-Prussian War, German Chancellor Otto Von Bismarck sought an alliance that included Russia to deter a French attempt to regain the lost territory of Alsace-Lorraine.  After Bismarck resigned in 1890, German Emperor Wilhelm II ended the Russian alliance and focused on building stronger relations with Austria-Hungary.  The stronger alliance Wilhelm II sought with Austria-Hungary only worsened relations with Russia since Austria-Hungary's most likely cause of mobilization would be for a war against Russia.

&quot;the day of Austro-Hungarian mobilization, for whatever cause, will be the day of German mobilization too&quot; – Kaiser Wilhelm II

Russia then pursued an alliance with France in 1892 that became final in 1894 to counter any future German or Austria-Hungarian aggression. The Russian-French Alliance then expanded in 1904 with the Entente cordiale between Britain and France to form the Triple Entente.  Britain joined the alliance over German threats to increase their navy's size and threaten the superiority of the British Royal Navy.  The German Empire and Austria-Hungary had also expanded their alliance in 1882 to include Italy to form the Triple Alliance. The Triple Alliance was renewed in 1902, but Italy did not fight with what would become the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary due to their non-defensive role in the conflict and Italy would eventually join the Entente.

== Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand ==
The assassination of the Archduke of Austria-Hungary Franz Ferdinand was the spark that touched off the powder keg built over the past decade by the alliances.  Austria-Hungary had taken over the administration of Bosnia-Herzegovina from the decaying Ottoman Empire which had angered the Kingdom of Serbia due to the large amount of Serbs living in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  This hostility eventually led to Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian-Serb student and member of Young Bosnia, shooting and killing the Archduke while he was traveling through Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina on June 28, 1914. --[[User:Kirkh|Kirkh]] ([[User talk:Kirkh|talk]]) 00:14, 23 August 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">===90&amp;deg; Image Rotation===
In 2D games it's often necessary to rotate an image by 90 degrees.  This algorithm does so quickly and easily.

===The Source:===
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
// Rotate90.cpp
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &quot;include/S.h&quot;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;sstream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	// All rotations are clockwise
	// rotate = 0 - do nothing
	// rotate = 1 - rotate 90
	// rotate = 2 - rotate 180
	// rotate = 3 - rotate 270
	// const int rotate;
        const int width = S::sw();         // The original Array's width
	cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;;
        const int height = S::sh(width);   // The original Array's height
	const int widthheight = width * height;
	int source[widthheight];
	int dest[widthheight];
	int rotate;

        for(int x = 0; x &lt; widthheight; x++)
                source[x]=x;

	cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\n\n&quot;;
	S::print_rect(width, height, &amp;source[0]);

	cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\nTo rotate clockwise by 0   degrees enter 0.&quot;
	     &lt;&lt; &quot;\nTo rotate clockwise by 90  degrees enter 1.&quot;
	     &lt;&lt; &quot;\nTo rotate clockwise by 180 degrees enter 2.&quot;
	     &lt;&lt; &quot;\nTo rotate clockwise by 270 degrees enter 3: &quot;;
	cin &gt;&gt; rotate;	
	cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\n\n&quot;;

	switch(rotate)
	{
		// Do nothing
		case 0:
			S::print_rect(width, height, &amp;source[0]);
			break;

		// Rotate 90
		case 1:
			for(int h = 0, dest_col = height - 1; h &lt; height; ++h, --dest_col)
			{
				for(int w = 0; w &lt; width; w++)
				{
					dest[ ( w * height ) + dest_col] = source[h*width + w];
				}
			}

			S::print_rect(height, width, &amp;dest[0]);
			break;

		// Rotate 180
		case 2:

			{
				for ( int w=0, dest_col=(width-1); w &lt; width; ++w, --dest_col )

				}
			}

			S::print_rect(width, height, &amp;dest[0]);
			break;

		// Rotate 270
		case 3:

			{
				for(int w=0, dest_row=width-1; w &lt; width; --dest_row, ++w)
				{

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Optimized Image Scaling===
This takes the previous, non-optimzed version of the integer scaling program and changes a few things to make it much quicker.

===The Source:===
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
// IntegerScale.cpp

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &quot;include/S.h&quot;

using namespace std;

/************************************************************
 * This is the speed optimized version of our IntegerScale()
 * function.  Readability is a distant second to speed.
 * We pre-calculate everything we can rather than calculating
 * over and over in the inner for loops.  Where we can't
 * pre-calculate, we move the calculation as &quot;high&quot; up in the
 * for loop chain as we can.  We move definitions of variables
 * out of the loops so they're defined once rather than every 
 * iteration.  Instead of rebuilding a row scale times we
 * calculate it once, then copy it scale-1 times.  It is a
 * much quicker algorithm, but it's also much more difficult
 * to read or explain.  After seeing the original, unoptomized
 * scale function, it should be easier to see what this one
 * is doing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Flip Image===
Probably the most common reason to flip an image in gaming is to reverse the direction a character is running.  For instance, if our Ragamuffin is running left, we could use this algorithm to flip his image and have him run to the right.  You'd typically do this ''before'' you actually needed to have him run in the other direction.  This algorithm may actually be more beneficial in a sprite creation program than in the game itself, but either way it neatly flips the image horizontally, or vertically.

===The Source:===

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
// Flip.cpp
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &quot;include/S.h&quot;

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	static int width=S::sw();
	static int height=S::sh(width);
	int horizontal;
	int *position;
	int source[width*height];
	int dest[width*height];

	cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\n\n&quot;;

        for(int x = 0; x &lt; width*height; x++)
                source[x]=x;

	S::print_rect(width, height, &amp;source[0]);

	cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\nFlip horizontally?&quot;
	     &lt;&lt; &quot;\nEnter 1 for true, 0 for false: &quot;;
	cin &gt;&gt; horizontal;
	cout &lt;&lt; endl;

	if(horizontal)
	{
		for(int h = 0; h &lt; height; ++h)
		{
			position=&amp;source[h*width];
			for(int w = width - 1, i = 0; w &gt; -1; --w, ++i)
				dest[h*width + i] = position[w];
		}
	}
	else
	{
		for(int h = height - 1, i = 0; h &gt; -1; --h, ++i)
		{
			position=&amp;source[h*width];
			for(int w = 0; w &lt; width; ++w)
				dest[i*width+w] = position[w];
		}
	}

	S::print_rect(width, height, &amp;dest[0]);
	cout &lt;&lt; endl;
}


&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Non-optimized Integer Scaling===

===Introduction===
This algorithm demonstrates scaling an image by one positive integer value in both the x and y axis. A common use for this algorithm would be taking a game made for a GameBoy's low resolution screen and doubling or tripling it before displaying it on a PC's high resolution monitor.

This algorithm keeps the aspect ratio of the original image. Think of watching old TV shows on a widescreen monitor. You can either stretch the image to fit the screen, distorting the original image and making all the actors appear fatter, or you can watch in the original aspect ratio, but then you have black bars on either side of the screen. With this algorithm you'd have the black bars. Princess Peach won't have to worry about why she's gained so much weight!

To understand how this algorithm works, it's important to know how most libraries store image data in memory. Where an image is a two dimensional object, most libraries store the individual pixels of the image in a single dimensional array - a line. The game has to keep track of the height of the image and its width to manipulate the image. Some libraries, like SDL, hide this from you until you need to do something like rotate or scale the image.

===Setting up the Problem===
To show how this works, we'll scale one 3x3 image. In the following images, each square will represent a single pixel.

&lt;table class=&quot;square&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;purp&quot;&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;black&quot;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gray&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;aqua&quot;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;yellow&quot;&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;green&quot;&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;pine&quot;&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;Stored in an array, that image looks like:

&lt;table class=&quot;array&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;purp&quot;&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;black&quot;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gray&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;aqua&quot;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;yellow&quot;&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;green&quot;&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;pine&quot;&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;If you're trying to come up with an algorithm, it's handy to step through the problem a piece at a time. The first thing we're going to do is copy the first pixel three times:

&lt;table class=&quot;array2&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;purp2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;purp2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;purp2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;We need to continue copying 3 pixels for every pixel in the source image until we hit the end of the row to properly scale the width of the image:

&lt;table class=&quot;array2&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;purp2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;purp2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;purp2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;black2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;black2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;black2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;red2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;red2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;red2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;Then we need to repeat this 3 times to properly scale the height of the image:

      <text xml:space="preserve">===The Helper Functions===
Rather than writing a function to print the 2D array of integers for every one of these simple examples, or manually ask for and validate input, these helper functions do the work for us.  It also keeps the code cleaner, keeping the printing away from the algorithm we're showing.

== problems ==

Version 3.5-9.1 with a PalmOS 4.0 ROM reports &lt;code&gt;SysTicksPerSecond()&lt;/code&gt; as 100 when it should be 10,000.  Programs need to adjust accordingly for timing (such as with &lt;code&gt;EvtGetEvent&lt;/code&gt;) to work as expected.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A Brief History of F#

I would say that there are two basic programming paradigms: declarative, and imperative. Under the declarative umbrella you have things like functional languages, languages based on relational algebra/calculus, and many DSL’s. Under the imperative umbrella you would find things like procedural (structured programming) and object oriented / component oriented languages.

Things are not always as clear cut as that of course: with F#, for example, allowing imperative style programming while generally being biased towards a declarative approach.

---------------------------------------------------
I totally agree with this ^. It stuck out like a saw thumb.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction to the Writing Section==
The Writing section of the SAT is meant to test your aptitude with English grammar. You'll need to write an essay in 25 minutes, identify and correct grammatical errors and revise writing for both style and grammar. 

The SAT typically has 2 sections of writing and the essay. The questions are categorized as improving sentences, identifying sentence errors and improving paragraphs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">About a third of the questions in the writing section are identifying sentence error questions. A question typically looks like 
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
The &lt;u&gt;other delegates&lt;/u&gt; (A) and &lt;u&gt;him&lt;/u&gt; (B) &lt;u&gt;immediately&lt;/u&gt; (C) accepted
the resolution &lt;u&gt;drafted&lt;/u&gt; (D) by the neutral states. &lt;u&gt;No error&lt;/u&gt; (E)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The error with this sentence is (B). Him is the objective form of the pronoun he. You use Him (or Her, them or whom) when you want that person to be the ''object'' of the sentence. That is, you want something done to that person. But in this sentence, a person is doing something, namely accepting something. This makes that person the ''subject''.

The correct usage of him would look like
&lt;blockquote style =&quot;background:white; border:1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
The neutral states proposed a resolution that the other delegates and him immediately accepted.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Questions like this are to be expected on the test. You should have an ear for grammatical errors after completing this chapter.

The above example featured an error in pronoun choice. The types of errors you can expect on the test include
*Subject Verb Agreement
*Verb Tense
*Diction
*Parallelism
*Verb form
*Comparisons
*Pronoun choice

==Common errors==
The errors featured in this section show up on the test most often. Expect to see 3 or 4 of each of these types of errors on a test.
===Subject-Verb Agreement===
Subject-verb agreement questions are relatively easy for native English speakers. Most of these errors can figured out if you have an ear for the English language. Errors in subject-verb agreement just sound wrong. 
A typical error in subject-verb agreement looks like
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
Here comes Jim and Jack
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The error here is that comes is plural but the subject, Jim and Jack, is plural. This sentence uses the wrong verb for its subject and the subject and verb don't agree. The following pages deal with subject verb agreement.
#[[/Identify the correct subject|Identify the correct subject]]
#[[/Subjects with multiple nouns or pronouns|Subjects with multiple nouns or pronouns]]
#[[/Identifying Singular and Plural Subjects|Identifying Singular and Plural Subjects]]
#[[/Indefinite Pronouns|Indefinite Pronouns]]
#[[/Practice In Subject-Verb Agreement|Practice In Subject-Verb Agreement]]

===Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement===
===Verb Tense===
===Diction===

==Uncommon errors==
===Comparisons===
===Verb Form===
===Pronoun choice===
==Rare errors==
===Parallelism===
===Idiom===
===Modifiers===
===Sentence Fragments and Run-Ons===
===Verbosity===

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Blitz runtime module provides low level functionality required by  BlitzMax applications when they are running. This includes things like memory management, exception handling and string and array operations.

Much of the functionality provided by this module is hidden from application programmers, but is instead used 'behind the scenes' by the compiler. However, there are some very useful commands for debugging, memory management and simple standard IO.

=Globals=

==AppDir==
''Global AppDir$=&quot;bbAppDir&quot;''

'''Description''': Application directory

'''Information''': The [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#AppDir|AppDir]] global variable contains the fully qualified directory of the currently
executing application. An application's initial current directory is also set to [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#AppDir|AppDir]]
when an application starts.

'''Example''':
&lt;pre&gt;
' appdir.bmx
' requests the user to select a file from the application's directory

Print &quot;Application Directory=&quot;+AppDir$

file$=RequestFile(&quot;Select File to Open&quot;,&quot;&quot;,False,AppDir$)

Print &quot;file selected was :&quot;+file
&lt;/pre&gt;

==AppFile==
''Global AppFile$=&quot;bbAppFile&quot;''

'''Description''': Application file name

'''Information''': The [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#AppFile|AppFile]] global variable contains the fully qualified file name of the currently
executing application.

'''Example''':
&lt;pre&gt;
' appfile.bmx

Print &quot;This program's executable is located at &quot;+AppFile$
&lt;/pre&gt;

==AppTitle==
''Global AppTitle$=&quot;bbAppTitle&quot;''

'''Description''': Application title

'''Information''': The [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#AppTitle|AppTitle]] global variable is used by various commands when a
default application title is required - for example, when opening simple
windows or requesters.
Initially, [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#AppTitle|AppTitle]] is set the value &quot;BlitzMax Application&quot;. However, you may change
[[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#AppTitle|AppTitle]] at any time with a simple assignment.

==AppArgs==
''Global AppArgs$[]=&quot;bbAppArgs&quot;''

'''Description''': Arguments passed to the application at startup

'''Information''': The [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#AppArgs|AppArgs]] global array contains the command line parameters sent to an application
when it was started. The first element of [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#AppArgs|AppArgs]] always contains the name of the
application. However, the format of the name may change depending on how the application
was launched. Use [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#AppDir|AppDir]] or [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#AppFile|AppFile]] for consistent information about the applications name
or directory.

'''Example''':
&lt;pre&gt;
' appargs.bmx
' print the command line arguments passed to the program at runtime

Print &quot;Number of arguments = &quot;+AppArgs.length

For a$=EachIn AppArgs
Print a$
Next
&lt;/pre&gt;

==LaunchDir==
''Global LaunchDir$=&quot;bbLaunchDir&quot;''

'''Description''': Directory from which application was launched

'''Information''': The [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#LaunchDir|LaunchDir]] global variable contains the current directory at the time the
application was launched. This is mostly of use to command line tools which may need to
access the 'shell' current directory as opposed to the application directory.

'''Example''':
&lt;pre&gt;
' launchdir.bmx

Print &quot;This program was launched from &quot;+LaunchDir$
&lt;/pre&gt;

=Functions=

==RuntimeError==
''Function RuntimeError( message$ )''

'''Description''': Generate a runtime error

'''Information''': Throws a TRuntimeException.

'''Example''':
&lt;pre&gt;
' runtimeerror.bmx

If a=0 RuntimeError &quot;This program has failed badly.&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

==DebugStop==
''Function DebugStop()''

'''Description''': Stop program execution and enter debugger

'''Information''': If there is no debugger present, this command is ignored.

==DebugLog==
''Function DebugLog( message$ )''

'''Description''': Write a string to debug log

'''Information''': If there is no debugger present, this command is ignored.

'''Comment''': note that, unlike [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#Assert|Assert]], DebugLog will get compiled regardless of the compilation mode - just that nothing is printed in Release mode.

==OnEnd==
''Function OnEnd( fun() )''

'''Description''': Add a function to be called when the program ends

'''Information''': [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#OnEnd|OnEnd]] allows you to specify a function to be called when the program ends. OnEnd functions are called
in the reverse order to that in which they were added.

'''Example''':
&lt;pre&gt;
' onend.bmx

Function cleanup()
Print &quot;cleaning up&quot;
End Function

OnEnd cleanup
Print &quot;program running&quot;
End	'the cleanup function will be called at this time
&lt;/pre&gt;

==ReadStdin==
''Function ReadStdin$()''

'''Description''': Read a string from stdin

'''Returns''': A string read from stdin. The newline terminator, if any, is included in the returned string.

==WriteStdout==
''Function WriteStdout( str$ )''

'''Description''': Write a string to stdout

'''Information''': Writes '''str''' to stdout and flushes stdout.

==WriteStderr==
''Function WriteStderr( str$ )''

'''Description''': Write a string to stderr

'''Information''': Writes '''str''' to stderr and flushes stderr.

==Delay==
''Function Delay( millis )''

'''Description''': Wait for a given number of milliseconds

'''Information''':
[[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#Delay|Delay]] suspends program execution for at least '''millis''' milliseconds.
A millisecond is one thousandth of a second.

==MilliSecs==
''Function MilliSecs()''

'''Description''': Get millisecond counter

'''Returns''': Milliseconds since computer turned on.

'''Information''':
[[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#MilliSecs|MilliSecs]] returns the number of milliseconds elapsed since the computer
was turned on.
A millisecond is one thousandth of a second.

==MemAlloc==
''Function MemAlloc:Byte Ptr( size )''

'''Description''': Allocate memory

'''Returns''': A new block of memory '''size''' bytes long

==MemFree==
''Function MemFree( mem:Byte Ptr )''

'''Description''': Free allocated memory

'''Information''': The memory specified by '''mem''' must have been previously allocated by [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#MemAlloc|MemAlloc]] or [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#MemExtend|MemExtend]].

==MemExtend==
''Function MemExtend:Byte Ptr( mem:Byte Ptr,size,new_size )''

'''Description''': Extend a block of memory

'''Returns''': A new block of memory '''new_size''' bytes long

'''Information''': An existing block of memory specified by '''mem''' and '''size''' is copied into a new block
of memory '''new_size''' bytes long. The existing block is released and the new block is returned.

==MemClear==
''Function MemClear( mem:Byte Ptr,size )''

'''Description''': Clear a block of memory to 0

==MemCopy==
''Function MemCopy( dst:Byte Ptr,src:Byte Ptr,size )''

'''Description''': Copy a non-overlapping block of memory

==MemMove==
''Function MemMove( dst:Byte Ptr,src:Byte Ptr,size )''

'''Description''': Copy a potentially overlapping block of memory

==GCSetMode==
''Function GCSetMode( mode )''

'''Description''': Set garbage collector mode

'''Information''':
'''mode''' can be one of the following:&lt;br&gt;
1 : automatic GC - memory will be automatically garbage collected&lt;br&gt;
2 : manual GC - no memory will be collected until a call to GCCollect is made&lt;br&gt;
The default GC mode is automatic GC.

==GCSuspend==
''Function GCSuspend()''

'''Description''': Suspend garbage collector

'''Information''':
[[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#GCSuspend|GCSuspend]] temporarily suspends the garbage collector. No garbage
collection will be performed following a call to [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#GCSuspend|GCSuspend]].&lt;br&gt;
Use [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#GCResume|GCResume]] to resume the garbage collector. Note that [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#GCSuspend|GCSuspend]]
and [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#GCResume|GCResume]] 'nest', meaning that each call to [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#GCSuspend|GCSuspend]] must be
matched by a call to [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#GCResume|GCResume]].

==GCResume==
''Function GCResume()''

'''Description''': Resume garbage collector

'''Information''':
[[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#GCResume|GCResume]] resumes garbage collection following a call to [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#GCSuspend|GCSuspend]].&lt;br&gt;
See [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#GCSuspend|GCSuspend]] for more details.

==GCCollect==
''Function GCCollect()''

'''Description''': Run garbage collector

'''Returns''': The amount of memory, in bytes, collected.

'''Information''':
This function will have no effect if the garbage collector has been
suspended due to [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#GCSuspend|GCSuspend]].

==GCMemAlloced==
''Function GCMemAlloced()''

'''Description''': Memory allocated by application

'''Returns''': The amount of memory, in bytes, currently allocated by the application

'''Information''':
This function only returns 'managed memory'. This includes all objects, strings and
arrays in use by the application.

==GCEnter==
''Function GCEnter()''

'''Description''': Private: do not use

==GCLeave==
''Function GCLeave()''

'''Description''': Private: do not use

==HandleFromObject==
''Function HandleFromObject( obj:Object )''

'''Description''': Convert object to integer handle

'''Returns''': An integer object handle

'''Information''':
After converting an object to an integer handle, you must later
release it using the [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#Release|Release]] command.

==HandleToObject==
''Function HandleToObject:Object( handle )''

'''Description''': Convert integer handle to object

'''Returns''': The object associated with the integer handle

'''Example''':
&lt;pre&gt;
' handlefromobject.bmx

Type MyType
	Field x:Int=100
End Type

Local obj:MyType=New MyType
Local handle:Int=HandleFromObject(obj)
Print &quot;handle = &quot;+handle

Local obj2:MyType=MyType(HandleToObject(handle))

Print &quot;x = &quot;+obj2.x

Release handle
&lt;/pre&gt;

=Keywords=

==Strict==

'''Description''': Set strict mode

'''Information''':
See [[BlitzMax/Language/BASIC_Compatibility|BASIC Compatibility]] for more information on Strict mode programming.

'''Comment''': In Strict mode automatic data typing is permitted. The default data type is Int.

'''Example''':
&lt;pre&gt;
Rem
Strict advises the BlitzMax compiler to report as errors all auto defined variables.
End Rem

Strict

local a=10

b=20	'compiler error, strict mode means variables must be declared b4 use
&lt;/pre&gt;

==SuperStrict==

'''Description''': Set SuperStrict mode

'''Comment''': In SuperStrict mode data types must always be specified.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Declaring Variables

“Variable” should probably be reserved for mutable objects, as is noted later on in the page. I prefer to think of the “let” keyword as assigning labels (identifiers) to functions or values. In effect what I’m getting with “let” is a convenient way of recalling/reusing an expression by name. Another way could be to think of “let” as always binding to a function, with “let x = 5” creating a function “x” that always returns 5. Conceptually “let z = add 5 10” binds the expression “add 5 10” to the identifier “z”, even if the compiler decides to replace z with the value 15.

==Currying Example==

I would recommend using Increment instead of Add5 as an example for the currying of the addition of two numbers function; it is just a more meaningful concept, and many Algol style programming languages support it through the privileged ++ operator.
--[[Special:Contributions/71.20.100.94|71.20.100.94]] ([[User talk:71.20.100.94|talk]]) 21:59, 25 October 2010 (UTC)

==Parameterless function==
The article currently says,
:''Functions return unit when they don't need to return any value to the programmer. For example, a function that prints a string to the console obviously doesn't have a return value:''
::&lt;tt&gt;let helloWorld = printfn &quot;hello world&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;
:''This function takes no parameters and returns ().''
I'm a bit confused by this. What is the &quot;function (that) takes no parameters&quot;? It presumably is not &quot;printfn&quot;, because that takes parameters. So is it &quot;helloWorld&quot;? I'm an F# newbie, but it looks like helloWorld is a value of type unit, not &quot;a function that prints a string to the console&quot;. [[User:Matt Crypto|Matt Crypto]] ([[User talk:Matt Crypto|talk]]) 13:00, 18 December 2009 (UTC)

&quot;helloWorld&quot; would be the function that's refered to in the sentence 'This function takes no parameters and returns ().'
[[User:Andreartus|Andreartus]] ([[User talk:Andreartus|talk]]) 14:49, 2 May 2010 (UTC)

== Recursive function ==

recursive function needs a better explanation. There is no explanation and was very difficult to understand.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Czech''' is an [[w:en:Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[w:en:West Slavic languages|West Slavic Language]], especially similar to [[w:en:Slovak language|Slovak]], which means it is very likely for a native speaker of each to also understand some Russian, Polish, Serbo-Croatian, Slovenian, etc. Czech and Slovak are very similar languages, and at first glance, one may incorrectly think of them as being dialects of each other, in the same manner that one might compare [[Spanish]] and [[Catalan]]. Czech is spoken by 10 million people as a native language and at least 6 million as a de facto second language. Even before the birth of Czechoslovakia in 1918, Czechs and Slovaks have always understood each other without the need of a translator as both have been subjected to Austro-Hungarian domniation for many centuries until after the First World War.

The relatively hard parts of the language are, like all other Balto-Slavic Languages (except Bulgarian and Macedonian):
* Declination (7 cases)
* Several types and subtypes of endings for nouns and verbs

The easier parts may be:
* Simple, regular pronunciation
* Very simple and straightforward verb conjugations: Only one present tense (imperfective) two types of past and conditional tenses, a compound future (imprf.) a simple future (perf.). Verb are always found in pairs, imperfective on the left and the perfective on the right separated by a dash (usually, but NOT always, one adds a prefix to the imperfective infinitive to change it to perfective).

      <comment>/* Dialogue */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:
* Greet someone in Czech
* Say whether or not you speak/understand Czech
* Say how well you speak/understand Czech

===Dialogue===
A: Promiňte.

B: Dobrý den.

A: Mluvíte anglicky?

B: Anglicky mluvím jen trochu. Nemluvím moc dobře.

====Explanation====
A lot can be learned from this little dialogue. Let's go step through it part by part.

*''Promiňte'' means &quot;excuse me.&quot;
*''Dobrý den'' is used to say &quot;hello,&quot; but it literally means &quot;Good day.&quot; The word ''den'' (day) is a masculine noun. We'll discuss grammatical gender later on.
*''Mluvíte'' is a formal way &quot;you speak.&quot; In Czech, you don't need a pronoun in front of the verb to know whether it means ''I, you, he, she'', etc. The conjugation tells it all. In this case, because of the -''íte'' ending, you know the speaker is referring either to one person formally, or to many people at once.
*''Anglicky'' means &quot;English.&quot; Notice the way the letter C is pronounced - it is just like a &quot;ts&quot; combination.
*''Trochu'' means &quot;few&quot; or &quot;little.&quot;
*''Mluvím'' means &quot;I speak.&quot; This is another example of how you can tell which grammatical person someone is referring to just by the verb conjugation. Because of the ''-ím&quot; ending, it is known that the person is speaking about himself. Now, notice the word order of &quot;I speak a little [English]&quot; - you're literally saying &quot;Little [I] speak.&quot; In Czech, word order isn't very important because words take certain case endings to determine how they function in a sentence. Saying &quot;Mluvím trochu [anglicky]&quot; would work to the same effect.
*''Nemluvím'' - you can already understand the second half of this word. The ''ne-'' prefix negates the verb. Hence, ''nemluvím'' is the opposite of &quot;I speak&quot; - it is &quot;I don't speak.&quot;
*''Moc'' - very
*''Dobře&quot; means &quot;well.&quot; Use it correctly and don't mix it up with ''dobrý.'' Just as in English, ''well'' (''dobře'') is an adverb, while ''good'' (''dobrý'') is an adjective.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The two Dutch colonial companies, the WIC (West Indian Company) and the VOC (United East-Indian Company) both had an interest in Africa, but for very different reasons. The WIC was interested in the continent's coastal regions, mainly its tropical part as one of the three apices of the triangular trade. For the VOC the continent was a major geographical obstacle that made the journey to the spice islands of the East Indies like the Moluccas and Java long and dangerous. The company therefore looked for convenient way stations, pit stops, to increase the success rate of its voyages.

==The triangular trade==

The triangular trade is one of the darker aspects of the history of the Dutch empire, because one of its major ingredients was slave trading. The three corners of the triangle were:

#Amsterdam and other Dutch ports where colonial goods from the Americas where sold and European goods purchased.
#The ports of the African coast where European goods were exchanged for Africa's major 'product': '''''slaves'''''.
#The ports of the Americas, both North and South, where slaves that survived the horrors of the voyage were sold and American goods purchased.

===Dutch hypocrisy===
One of the reasons that the trade became triangular is that attempts to bring a cargo of slaves back to the ports of the Netherlands ended in a boycott. In the Netherlands proper slavery had long been abolished and the attempt to sell African slaves in Amsterdam and later in other cities resulted in an angry refusal to let the slaves set foot on Dutch soil. The captain had no choice but to try and salvage what was left of his 'cargo' by sailing them to the Americas. How many slaves survived yet another voyage is not known.

Despite the revulsion at the idea of slavery, the owners of the ships and shareholders of the WIC were regarded as prominent and powerful members of Dutch society. After all: money talks rather than smelling.

The WIC colonies that were to survive up to the decolonization of the 20st century, Suriname and the Antillian islands were mainly way stations for the slave trade from where they might stay for a while before being sold in cities like Savannah GA or Charleston SC. On the African side the company maintained a number of coastal settlements, the island of Goeree (named after an island on the coast of the province of Holland) is the most infamous. 

===African hypocrisy===
Slavery was not abolished in the colonies until 1866 (after the American Civil War) and at that time the very rationale for maintaining the small African coastal possessions was gone. They were handed over to Britain, that by that time had started to colonize the interior of the continent extensively. There had never been much reason for the WIC to penetrate the continent, because slaves did not need to be hunted. They could be ''bought''. In fact, a number of coastal African states thanked their power and wealth to their policy of enslavement of their African neighbors. They could then sell them for a good price to Dutch (and other) traders, while taking the possessions and the land of the people they had conveniently gotten rid of.

Today, some of the descendants of the ones sold into slavery seek their roots in Africa, at times amid the descendants of those that sold their ancestors off. 

==The Cape==

The involvement of the VOC in the more temperate zone at the Cape of Good Hope is a very different story. Its rationale was not that that area had much to offer in terms of exploitable products, human or otherwise. It was inhabited by people who had exceeded the hunter-gatherer state only partly. They did have sheep for instance, but these sheep did not produce wool. This meant that a stop over at this halfway point to Batavia was not possible, because what the ships needed: food, timber, repairs involving metal work etc. could not be provided by the local population.

This caused the VOC to do something it seldom did: to consider bringing in colonists from Holland to settle the area themselves. In fact the Cape colony founded in 1652 by van Riebeeck is the ''only'' successful attempt in Dutch colonial history to settle a region with a Dutch population. They brought in farmers (&quot;boeren&quot;) from the  The Afrikaans language spoken today in South Africa and Namibia is daughter language of Dutch.

One of the reasons the VOC was not too eager to establish a population settlement is the bottom-line nature of their philosophy: They feared that the Boers would trigger problems with the native population that they then would have to spend money on. The VOC disliked wars: they cost money.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Consumer surplus ===
A demand curve for a good with network externalities shows marginal willingness-to-pay for each potential quantity sold. In this way it is like a typical demand curve. However, because the demand curve for the product with network externalities shows '''demand equilibria''', the meaning is a little different. This difference is significant enough that reading consumer surplus off the demand curve becomes impossible.

It may help to consider a discrete example. We'll consider 6 possible consumers of a product with network externalities. Suppose each of them values the good even without network externalities, and that they all get the same benefit from network externalities, with the benefit equal Q, the size of the network.

Their values without network externalities are 7, 5, 7, 3, 7, and 1. We'll follow the traditional idea for constructing a demand schedule or &quot;curve&quot; (although since it's discrete it's not really a curve in this case), and order the consumers from those who value the good most highly to those who value it least. Then we can plot their WTP on a graph.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Consumer !! Value w/o network externalities !! Q !! Value including Q
|-
| 1|| 7|| 1|| 7+1 = 8
|-
| 2|| 7|| 2|| 7+2 = 9
|-
| 3|| 7|| 3|| 7+3 = 10
|-
| 4|| 5|| 4|| 5+4 = 9
|-
| 5|| 3|| 5|| 3+5 = 8
|-
| 6|| 1|| 6|| 1+6 = 7
|}
[[File:CS_discrete_demand_net_effects_01.svg]]

The graph shows the value (WTP) for each of the six consumers. '''If we could read willingness-to-pay from this graph in the same way as a typical demand graph (which we can't)''', we could see that at a price of 6, the first consumer has a surplus of 8-6, the second of 9-6, etc. Adding up the differences for all the consumers, we would find a consumer surplus of 15.

This is wrong, though. The actual consumer surplus (which we can figure out from our original description, but not from the graph) is 30. The reason can be figured out from the first consumer. Their value for the good is 7+Q, where Q is the number of other people purchasing the good. When we draw the demand curve, each point on the curve was a '''demand equilibrium''', so that expected quantity demanded and actual quantity demanded match. This is useful for drawing the demand curve, but it means the willingness-to-pay is only correct ''for that exact quantity''.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Q !! WTP
|-
| 1|| 7+1 = 8
|-
| 2|| 7+2 = 9
|-
| 3|| 7+3 = 10
|-
| 4|| 7+4 = 11
|-
| 5|| 7+5 = 12
|-
| 6|| 7+6 = 13
|}

This table shows the willingness-to-pay for the good depending on how many people actually purchased it. If the price was 6, and all 6 consumers decided to purchase the good, the WTP of the first consumer would be 13, instead of the 8 shown on the graph.

[[File:CS_discrete_demand_net_effects_02.svg]]

The green areas on the updated graph show the WTP if every consumer assumes that 6 people will be purchasing the product. Now we can find the consumer surplus by summing the difference between consumer's values and the price they pay. However, ''this is only correct'' if 6 consumers actually purchase the product. If fewer or more purchased the product, this would also give an incorrect consumer surplus value.

=== Efficiency in competitive equilibrium ===
If a product has no externalities, we generally find that the competitive equilibrium is efficient. There are a number of ways economists talk about this. One was is to point out that, in a competitive equilibrium, the marginal willingness-to-pay (from the demand curve) is the same as the marginal cost. Since usually the marginal willingness-to-pay (WTP) is falling and/or the marginal cost is rising with increasing quantity, this means that ...
# ... selling any less than the competitive equilibrium is inefficient, because at lower quantities the marginal willingness-to-pay is higher than the marginal cost, and
# ... selling any more than the competitive equilibrium is inefficient, because at higher quantities the marginal willingness-to-pay is lower than the marginal cost.

The part of that which remains true with (positive) network externalities is that in competitive equilibrium, the marginal willingness-to-pay equals the marginal cost. The part which is different is what happens when the quantity sold increases. If the competitive quantity sold is Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, where WTP = MC, and then the quantity sold '''increases''' to Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then the WTP for the Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sub&gt; unit increases due to the larger network benefits.

As an example, let's work with the demand from the consumer surplus section, and now suppose that the marginal cost is 9. In a competitive equilibrium, this would mean that 4 units would be sold at a price of 9.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Consumer 
! scope=&quot;col&quot; style=&quot;width:50px;&quot; | Value w/o network externalities
! scope=&quot;col&quot; style=&quot;width:20px;&quot; | Q

== Some Variations ==

=== Stand-alone value ===
[[File:Network_effects_example_03.svg]]

This graph represents a slightly different network. As you can see there is only one equilibrium point and this point is stable. The curve, Q&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; starts above the 45 degree line, even when Q=0, and remains so until point c. Should Q become greater than point c, then people would leave the network until Q retreated to point c, where Q&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; = Q.

On the other end, when Q=0, Q&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; is still positive. This illustrates the idea that even when there is no current demand, or no one currently in the network. There is still value in the network and people will want to join, ultimately reaching point c. This is an alternative to above, in that there is no critical mass point to achieve, because of this expectations play a much smaller role, if at all, in reaching that desirable equilibrium point c.

=== Early adopters ===
[[File:Network_effects_example_04.svg]]

Our final example allows for a more realistic representation of a network.

This is more similar to the first example in that we have the usual equilibrium points, two stable, one unstable.
The part of the curve where the slope is equal to zero, There is some constant quantity that will be demanded given the quantity in that network until the point on the graph where the line begins sloping upward.

Should this network reach critical mass, expectations are just as important as in our first example. When the network reaches the unstable equilibrium, point b(assuming that expectations work to get us there), expectations come in to play again. At point b there will be a drive, market momentum, to move towards point a or c. In our other example point a represented a network failure. Here point a is in the positive coordinates, the network would exist at this point although it would be very small and certainly not as ideal as point c.

== Summary ==

Critical mass and it's importance has been hammered away at through analysis of the examples. Expectations management is a tool that allows a firm to reach these points in order for a network to be successful and feedback certainly plays in as well. The issue now lies within a firms ability to determine/estimate the type of demand structure their network would face should they decide to create their product/network. The following section will discuss networks themselves and the different structures networks may be formatted to. Although this is not the solving parameter to determine demand structure, it is another tool that if the firm fully understands what they are doing, they can aggregate the knowledge of the topics thus far to create a business strategy for their network/product.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Identify the correct subject=
Problems often arise when test takers mistake another word as the subject of the sentence.
Both of the following questions feature errors with a mistaken subject.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
1) His understanding of the project requirements are what guaranteed him the job.
&lt;br /&gt;
2) The reforms to the election process, despite the popular opposition, was carried out.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In example 1, the subject ''His understanding of the project requirements'' is singular. He only has one understanding and this understanding encompasses all the project requirements. The subject is not the plural ''project requirements'' because the project requirements didn't guarantee him the job, it was his understanding. To correct this sentence, change ''..are what..'' to ''...is what...''.

In example 2, the subject ''reforms to the election process'' is a plural subject but the verb ''was'' is singular. &quot;He was tired&quot; is grammatically correct but &quot;They was tired&quot; is incorrect . To correct this sentence ''was'' to ''were''. Were is the plural form of the verb to be. &quot;They were tired&quot; is grammatically correct.

Try these two on your own:
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
1)The problems created by a faulty engine is fatal.
&lt;br /&gt;
2)The wildfire near Athens, which has been burning all day, are expected to be put out within the hour.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Dropbox|'''Answers'''|&lt;blockquote&gt;
1) The problems created by a faulty engine ''are'' fatal.&lt;br /&gt;
''problems'' is plural and ''is'' is a singular verb. &quot;He is tired.&quot; is correct but &quot;They is tired&quot; is incorrect. This should be &quot;They are tired.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2) The wildfire near Athens, which has been burning all day, ''is'' expected to be put out within the hour.&lt;br /&gt;
''wildfire near Athens'' is singular and needs a singular verb to agree with it
&lt;/blockquote&gt;|hidden=hidden|width=100%}}

The subject of a sentence is not affected by phrases like 
*along with
*in addition to 
*as well as
*including 
These phrases act more like adjectives. While the subject ''Jack and Jim were at home'' has a plural subject, ''Jack, along with Jim, was at home.'' has a singular subject. The subject is still Jack but the sentence also gives us the extra information that Jim is also home. This second sentence is centered around Jack and Jim's status is only an afterthought.
Take at look at this example:
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
One of his cars, along with 3 other motorcycles, are in the shop
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
''One of his cars'' is the singular subject in this sentence. The 3 other motorcycles are just afterthoughts and is extra information. Think of this sentence as &quot;One of his cars are in the shop&quot;. This sounds wrong. ''One of his cars'' is singular and ''are'' is a plural verb. We correct this sentence by changing the ''are'' into ''is''.

Try these examples:
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
1) The President, as well as members of congress, make laws.
&lt;br /&gt;
2) The brunt of the effects of war, including poverty and fatality, are bore by civilians.
&lt;br /&gt;
3) Infectious diseases, including malaria and syphilis, continues to plague mankind.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{DropBox|Answers|&lt;blockquote&gt;
1) The President, as well as members of congress, ''makes'' laws. &lt;br /&gt;
''The President'' is a singular subject so it needs the singular ''makes'' to agree. Think of this sentence as &quot;The President makes laws.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2)The brunt of the effects of war, including poverty and fatality, ''is'' bore by civilians. &lt;br /&gt;
''brunt of the effects'' is our singular subject. and it needs a singular verb to go along with it.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
3)Infectious diseases, including malaria and syphilis, ''continue'' to plague mankind. &lt;br /&gt;
''Infectious diseases'' is plural and therefore needs a plural verb
&lt;/blockquote&gt;|hidden=hidden}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Subjects with multiple nouns or pronouns=
== Plural Subjects ==
Nouns joined by ''and'' form compound subjects and require plural verbs.
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
The mice and keyboards is in the box.
&lt;br /&gt;
Jack and Jill goes up the hill.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
''mice and keyboards'' is a compound subject and needs the verb ''is'' changed to ''are''.
Similarly, ''Jack and Jill'' is plural; this sentence requires need the plural ''go'' to make the subjects and verb agree.

Try these examples:
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
1) The bike and car goes inside the garage.
&lt;br /&gt;
2)Several trees and a verdant bush grows outside the barn.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Dropbox|'''Answers'''|&lt;blockquote&gt;
1) The bike and car ''go'' inside the garage. &lt;br /&gt;
''bike and car'' is a plural subject (there are multiple nouns) so ''goes'' needs to be changed to ''go''.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2)Several trees and a verdant bush ''grow'' outside the barn.&lt;br /&gt;
''Several trees and a verdant bush'' is a plural subject so ''grows'' needs to be changed to ''grow''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;|hidden=hidden|width=100%}}

== Singular Compound Subjects ==
In some cases, compound subjects can be singular. &quot;Green eggs and ham&quot;, &quot;Macaroni and cheese&quot; and &quot;PC Richards and Son&quot; are examples of singular compound subjects. They act as a singular subject. Questions like these are rare but you should know them anyway. The problem is that these are usually idiomatic requires a knowledge of American culture in addition to English grammar.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Macaroni and cheese&lt;/u&gt; (A) &lt;u&gt;are&lt;/u&gt; (B) my favorite meal.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Let's say this was the question (this example doesn't follow the format of the real test), how would you know if ''Macaroni and cheese'' is a plural subject or a singular subject? Only ''Macaroni and cheese'' and ''are'' are possible choices for an error. This means that ''meal'' must be correct. ''meal'' is singular which means the subject of this sentence has to be singular as well. ''are'' can be changed (since it's underlined) and it should be changed. After all, ''are'' is plural and we have a singular subject. To correct this sentence make the ''are'' an &quot;is&quot;. This reasoning is an effective strategy to use on the writing section. There are many ways to fix a sentence but you are limited in what you can do on the test by what words are mutable and underlined.

Here are some more examples:
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
1) His pride and joy, a red convertible, were trashed in the accident.
&lt;br /&gt;
2) &quot;Heart and soul&quot; were a popular song in the 1940s.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Dropbox|'''Answers'''|&lt;blockquote&gt;
1) His pride and joy, a red convertible, ''was'' trashed in the accident.
&lt;br /&gt;
''pride and joy'' should be taken as a singular subject
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2)&quot;Heart and soul&quot; ''was'' a popular song in the 1940s.
&lt;br /&gt;
The song is &quot;Heart and soul&quot; and is a singular subject.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;|hidden=hidden|width=100%}}

== Or and Nor Joining Singular Nouns ==
When singular nouns are joined by &quot;or&quot; or &quot;nor&quot; a singular verb is needed. 
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
Jack or Jill go up the hill.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This should be corrected as 
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
Jack or Jill goes up the hill.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The two singular subjects, ''Jack'' and ''Jill'' are joined by &quot;or&quot; so a singular verb is needed. Think of it like this, only one child, either Jack or Jill, went up the hill. A plural verb shouldn't make sense since a plurality of children going up a hill doesn't exist, only one child.

Try these examples:
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
1) A glass of water or tea are what I ordered.
&lt;br /&gt;
2)Neither Jack nor Jill plan to go up the hill.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Dropbox|'''Answers'''|&lt;blockquote&gt;
1)  A glass of water or tea ''is'' what I ordered. &lt;br /&gt;
A single glass of &quot;water&quot; or &quot;tea&quot; as our subject means we need a singular verb.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2) Neither Jack nor Jill ''plans'' to go up the hill.&lt;br /&gt;
We change the verb ''plan'' to ''plans'' because the singular ''Jack'' and ''Jill'' are joined by ''nor''.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;|hidden=hidden|width=100%}}
== Or and Nor Joining Plural and Singular Nouns ==
The previous section covered the case when &quot;or&quot; or &quot;nor&quot; joins two singular subjects. But when &quot;or&quot; or &quot;nor&quot; join a plural and singular noun, the tense of the verb is determined by whichever word is closer to the verb. For an example look at the following grammatically correct sentences:
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
Neither Jill's friends nor Jack plans to go up the hill.&lt;br /&gt;
Neither Jack not Jill's friends plan to go up the hill.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Both of these sentences are equivalent statements. In the first sentence, Jack is closer to the verb, ''plans''. Since Jack is singular, the verb is singular. In the second sentence, ''Jill's friends'', a plural  subject, is closer to the verb so the verb is in it's plural form.

Try these examples:
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
1) Either a pitcher of water or cups of tea is on the tray.
&lt;br /&gt;
2) Neither french fries nor macaroni and cheese are cheap enough to fit my budget.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Dropbox|'''Answers'''|&lt;blockquote&gt;
1) Either a pitcher of water or cups of tea ''are'' on the tray. &lt;br /&gt;
''pitcher of water'' and ''cups of tea'' are singular and plural nouns respectively joined by &quot;or&quot;. Since ''cups of tea'' is closer to the verb ''is'', this verb needs to be in a form that reflects that it is closer to a plural subject. Change the ''is'' into an ''are'' to correct the error.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2)  Neither french fries nor macaroni and cheese ''is'' cheap enough to fit my budget. &lt;br /&gt;
If you recall the previous section ''macaroni and cheese'' is a singular subject. Then it needs a singular verb to agree with it. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;|hidden=hidden|width=100%}}
== Or and Nor with Mixed Nouns and Pronouns ==
Now, let's look at the case when you mix up the nouns with ''or'' or ''nor''. When you have sentences that contain pronouns and nouns that vary in person (that is, first person, second person, third person) joined by ''or'' or ''nor'' the verb has to agree with the person of the subject closest to it.
Take a look at the following '''correct''' sentences.
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
Either Jack or you are going up the hill.&lt;br /&gt;
Neither you nor Jack is going up the hill.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
These are examples of what it should look like. &quot;You&quot; is a second-person pronoun so when it is closer to the verb, the verb is expected to be in its second person form. In the second sentence, ''Jack'' is a third person subject so it needs a third person verb.

Try these examples:
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
1) Neither Jim nor I is going on vacation.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Either Jack or you is expected to show up.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{DropBox|'''Answers'''|&lt;blockquote&gt;
1)Neither Jim nor I ''am'' going on vacation.&lt;br /&gt;
2)Either Jack or you ''are'' expected to show up.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;|hidden=hidden|width=100%}}

== Verb is determined by the subject ==
Lastly, remember not to confuse the subject no matter how many nouns or pronouns are present in the sentence.
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
The basket of apples are on the shelf
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This sentence is incorrect. ''are'' is the wrong verb to use with the singular subject ''basket''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Identifying Singular and Plural Subjects=
==Subjects that are Plural and Singular==
Some subjects can act as either a plural or a singular subject. Collective nouns like ''family'' or ''team'' are either singular or plural depending on the context.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The majority prefers chocolate ice cream.
&lt;br /&gt;
The majority have vanilla ice cream cones.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the first sentence, ''The majority'' is taken as a single unit. We're not saying the whole group prefers chocolate ice cream, only the singular majority does. In the second sentence, we use ''have'', a plural verb, because a majority of the group implies multiple people. Thus, we use a plural verb form.

Other common collective nouns include
*Committee
*Band
*Dozen
*Audience
*Flock
*Pack

Here are some examples:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
1)A dozen eggs are eight dollars.&lt;br /&gt;
2)The platoon is returning to their homes.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{DropBox|'''Answers'''|&lt;blockquote&gt;
1) A dozen eggs ''is'' eight dollars.&lt;br /&gt;
Dozen is singular in this context. The whole set costs $8, not each individual egg. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2) The platoon are returning to their homes. &lt;br /&gt;
The platoon consists of soldiers that live in their own homes. The whole platoon doesn't live in one house. Each soldier lives in his or her own home. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;|hidden=hidden|width=100%}}

==Plural Subjects that Sound Singular==
Some words like the names of countries, diseases, institutions and books may sound plural but they are actually singular nouns. The United States is a singular noun. The measles is a singular noun. For native English speakers, generally if you can put a &quot;The&quot; before the noun and the phrase doesn't sound wrong to you the noun is probably singular. &quot;The World Series&quot;, &quot;The Olympics&quot;, &quot;The Netherlands&quot; are all examples of singular subjects that look plural.

Here are some examples:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
1) The United Arab Emirates are a federation of 7 emirates in the Arabian peninsula.&lt;br /&gt;
2) The 2012 Summer Olympics are being held in London.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{DropBox|'''Answers'''|&lt;blockquote&gt;
1)The United Arab Emirates ''is'' a federation of 7 emirates in the Arabian peninsula. &lt;br /&gt;
The United Arab Emirates is a single entity so it needs a singular verb to go along with it.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2)The 2012 Summer Olympics ''is'' being held in London.&lt;br /&gt;
Although the Olympics is a collection of different sports, the Olympics themselves is a singular object. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;|hidden=hidden|width=100%}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Indefinite Pronouns=
Indefinite pronouns, like ''everyone'', ''anyone'' or ''few'', can include an unspecified number of unspecified objects. There are special rules that govern these nouns.
==Indefinite Pronouns that Sound Plural==
The following words sound plural but require singular verb.
*each
*either
*neither
*the bodies
*#anybody
*#everybody
*#somebody
*#nobody
*the ones
*#anyone
*#everyone
*#someone
*#somebody

The following examples illustrate their correct usage:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Each person is different.&lt;br /&gt;
Each boy and girl gets one carton of milk.&lt;br /&gt;
Either boy is suitable for the job.&lt;br /&gt;
Neither person lives here.&lt;br /&gt;
Anyone who registers for this account will receive a marker.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All of the pronouns define something that applies to everyone in the collection. This is why we use the singular verb. 
However, remember to apply the rules we learned in previous sections. The sentence
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Either the democrats or the Republicans are going to win the election
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
has no errors. ''the Republicans'' is a plural verb and is closer to the verb so the verb takes a plural form. This is because the subjects are joined by an &quot;or&quot;.

==Indefinite Pronouns with Plural Verbs==
The following indefinite pronouns need plural verbs:
*several
*both
*many
*few
Each of these pronouns imply multiple objects and therefore need plural verbs. The following examples demonstrate their correct usage:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Both dogs are in the house.&lt;br /&gt;
Few children are going to be excluded from the trip.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Indefinite Pronouns with Verbs in Context==
These indefinite pronouns need either a singular or plural verb depending on the context of the sentence:
*any
*some
*most
*all
*none
These pronouns need a singular verb when they refer to a singular noun but need a plural noun when they refer to a plural noun.
The following examples demonstrate the correct usage of these pronouns:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some of the dogs are sick.&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the cake is eaten.&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the cake is left.&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the children are gone.&lt;br /&gt;
None of the wall is now visible.&lt;br /&gt;
None of the pencils are sharpened.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
When the pronoun references a singular object, we can use a singular verb but when it references a plural object, we need to change the verb.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some of this information belongs later into the guide.  This is currently more of a &quot;Honing your product&quot; type of page, where the beginning of the guide needs more of a &quot;Here's what you should know the first time you run the program&quot; feel to it.

Otherwise it's not a &quot;From Noob to Pro&quot; guide, but an &quot;Intermediate to Pro&quot; guide.  It certainly hasn't been introduced as such, but it definately has elements of that feel to it.

Precalculating mesh movements and burning in issues mean nothing to someone who in theory, hasn't even successfully made their first object/mesh yet because they've been instructed to move page by page through this guide.

I agree. These first few pages of Unit 1 hardly seem geared to a 'noob'. There are many terms that are not defined. This page shouldn't even be read until later.  Lets seem what we can do to adjust this.
--[[User:John.delannoy|John.delannoy]] 9:33, 7 December 2009

I agree with the above people, this &quot;Cheat the 3D&quot; section has me ready to throw in the towel.  Baking?  What is that?  You can't carry on about things the Newby doesn't know about yet.  It should be moved later or removed entirely.  TERRIBLE way to start a beginner's reference.

[[User:Rhettro|Rhettro]] ([[User talk:Rhettro|talk]]) 21:35, 10 June 2010 (UTC)The wording is somewhat confusing.  An image file is already a 2d plane.  Does the author mean that a image is applied to a named 2d plane and that plane then wrapped over the mesh? Or does the author intend that the reader imagine the image as placed on a 2d plane and then applied over an image.  In any case, the concept of UV mapping is an advanced texture application that should be brought up in the later section of a texturing chapter.  To talk about it so early in the book only serves to confuse the new reader.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Note: I removed an edit that seemed to be trying to make the heading bolder, I suspect the Anonymous editor was trying to learn wiki-language and was not sophisticated enough to realize that headers are preformatted and can't be enhanced except by increasing or decreasing the rank of the header. They are also probably not familiar with sgml based schemes such as html or XML and so didn't know how to properly mark up the language.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Precession==
In a classic beginning physics demonstration, the instructor stands on a swiveling platform and holds a spinning [[w:bicycle wheel|bicycle wheel]] at arm's length.  The wheel is [[w:vertical direction|vertical]] and the instructor is standing still.  The instructor then tilts the wheel toward [[w:Horizontal plane|horizontal]].  This causes the instructor to start spinning slowly on the platform&lt;!-- Which way?? --&gt;.  Bringing the wheel back to vertical and tilting it the other way makes the instructor spin the other way.  Why?

Imagine the wheel as a collection of small particles.  Particles want to move in a straight line.  In order for them to move in a circle there must be a force accelerating the particles toward the center of the circle ([[w:acceleration|acceleration]] is a change in speed or direction or both &amp;mdash; in this case just direction).  This force is ultimately provided by bonds between the atoms in the wheel and [[w:spoke|spokes]].

What happens when the instructor turns the spinning wheel from vertical to horizontal? Consider a particle somewhere on the wheel. If the wheel weren't being tilted, it would be accelerated around the circle as always.  But since the wheel is tilting, it now has to follow a new path.  A change in path is an acceleration, which in turn requires force (from the instructor's hands, transmitted through the spokes to the rim).  Now consider the particle opposite the first particle on the wheel.   It also has to change path, but in the opposite direction.  Since the forces on opposite sides are in opposite directions, the result is  torque.  Each pair of opposite particles on the wheel contributes to the torque that causes the instructor to turn on the platform.  The particles that are further away have a longer lever-arm in relation to the professor, so the net torque is non-zero. (Torque=Force*Lever-arm) &lt;!-- To really nail this down, we'd have to explain why they don't cancel each other out, that is why the net torque is non-zero --&gt;

Tilting the wheel the other direction produces torque in the opposite direction, slowing the instructor's spin and eventually reversing it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">*[[/Plato, ''Gorgias''/]]
*[[/Plato, ''Phadreus''/]]
*[[/Plato, ''Apology''/]]
This chapter will build off of the previous chapter on Plato's reservations toward orality by considering his rejection of [oral] rhetoric. Plato's rejection of rhetoric is built upon two general lines of argument:
*Democratic weakness: most people are little better than sheep and cannot be trusted to judiciously pierce rhetoric's &quot;oral&quot; spells. We saw an extensive treatment of this argument already in the ''Republic.''
*Epistemological weakness: rhetoric lacks proper knowledge. While we saw seeds of this argument in the ''Republic,'' it gains much more attention in the ''Gorgias,'' particularly in Socrates' assault on Polus. 
Plato's argument against rhetoric must be taken with a grain of salt--since the ''Gorgais'' and the ''Phaedrus'' are themselves masterful rhetorical performances. However, this irony does not negate his argumentation, since (as we saw in book seven of ''The Republic'') in both works he admits (in the Gorgias implicitly and in the Phaedrus explicitly) that certain situations require rhetorical abilities. In order for rhetoric to be righteous (i.e., aligned with Plato's Idea of the Good), it must be subservient to dialectical philosophy, used sparingly, and only by the most enlightened dialectical masters--the ''Republic'''s Philosopher Kings. Before turning direct attention to this week's readings, it is beneficial to examine how these themes appear in what many believe to be Plato's first major work, his ''Apology.''

Plato's first treatment of rhetoric, almost entirely hostile, occurs in his ''Apology'', the dramatic retelling of Socrates' trial and execution. Likely written between 390 and 399 BC (Kennedy 53), in the ''Apology'' Socrates chooses to die with plain truth rather than live thanks to excessive flourish. To manipulate an audience (a multitude) in pursuit of personal goals is unquestionable wickedness. On the other hand, to address individuals in pursuit of the truth is the highest good. Even after his condemnation, Socrates invites the jurors interested in what &quot;truly&quot; passed at his trial to stay and discuss the day. Kennedy stresses how Plato's Socrates places more blame on the orator's lined up against him than the jury who convicted him. This favoring of dialectic and deep suspicion of oratory surfaces in all of Plato's subsequent writings, including the Gorgias and Phaedrus. 

Almost all critics agree that the ''Gorgias'' is a vicious attack on rhetoric. By positioning Socrates against Gorgias, one of the more reputable sophists of the day, Plato attempts to distinguish Socratic dialectic from sophistic oratory. As we will see in coming chapters, no one in the Greek period wants to be identified as a sophist--though at one point or another Socrates, Plato, Gorgias, and Isocrates all find themselves faced with such an identification. While the precise definition for the term shifts--one thing is clear: each figure does his best to make sure the term applies to his opponent rather than himself. In the ''Gorgias,'' Socrates engages three opponents: Gorgias, Polus, and Callicles. In the ''Gorgias,'' sophistry is repeatedly identified as self-interested avarice. 

Contemporary scholars disagree sharply on interpretations of the ''Phaedrus.'' Some, such as Kennedy and Welch argue that the ''Phaedrus'' represents a softening of the arguments against rhetoric in the ''Gorgias'' and earlier ''Apology.'' Others, such as Coulter and more recently McAdon, interpret Plato's seemingly complimentary stance toward rhetoric as a subtle satire against Isocrates' pragmatic rhetoric and his aloof characterization of Plato's Idealist philosophy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Chapter One: Plato's Battle Against an Oral World ==
*Plato, ''Republic'' Book VII

In his ''Preface to Plato,'' [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_A._Havelock Eric A. Havelock] addresses a problem that has plagued contemporary humanists for centuries: how does one interpret Plato's utter rejection for poetry, literature, and the imaginative arts in Book X of the [http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.html ''Republic'']? Against the general trait to ignore Book X, or treat it as hyperbolic, Havelock asserts that the rejection of the oral poetic tradition is ''the'' overwhelming goal of Plato's entire philosophic enterprise. It should be noted that Plato's reservations against epic and lyric poetry are not confined to Book X, or even the ''Republic,'' but can be found throughout a number of his other works (including ''Ion'').

Such a claim might sound preposterous to modern readers. Since Petrarch and the Renaissance (and intensified by the Romantic rejection of industrialization and urbanity), the high arts have chiefly served to resist mainstream cultural [http://www.cla.purdue.edu/English/theory/marxism/modules/althusserideologymainframe.html interpellation]. Havelock, however, demonstrates that, for the ancient world, the poetic-oral tradition was the chief interpellative agent. In short, we recognize a link between poetry and social criticism. Not so for Plato who sees the mimetic power of art as preventing the development of discrimination (see Book II of the ''Republic'' 50). 

Similar to Havelock, [http://libraries.slu.edu/special/digital/ong/artessays.php Walter J. Ong] demonstrates how the technological development of alphabetic writing helped to first generate an autonomous sense of subjectivity. Plato is one of the first philosophers to praise autonomy. The collective cultural songs prevented this [literate] process of individuation. Of course, a number of critics, including Ong and Havelock themselves, have noted the underlying irony concerning Plato's suspicions toward writing. Plato failed to recognize that the autonomy/individualism he valued was, at least in part, a function of the new communicative medium. Ong succinctly concludes that logical components of dialectical reasoning would not be possible without the objectifying power of alphabetically enhanced memory. A core component of Plato's dialectical methods required stabilizing thought from the transience of time (kairos is not an especially prominent topic in Plato nor in the Rhetoric of his student Aristotle).  In ''Presence of the Word'' Ong writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Plato’s ideas were the polar opposite [of the engaged sense of time and place particular to the oral-aural human lifeworld]: not events at all, but motionless “objective” existence, impersonal, and out of time. Forming the ultimate basis of all knowledge, they implied that intellectual knowledge was like sight—despite Plato’s well-spoken protests, discussed here later, in favor of the spoken word in his Seventh Letter and in the Phadreus. Basicaly, the Greek word idea means the look of a thing. It comes from the same root as the Latin video [I see], which yields the English “vision” and its cognates. (33-34)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
From Havelock's perspective, Plato represents one of the first philosophers to preference alphabetic autonomy, and his Republic can be seen as creating a curriculum and pedagogy around this new technology. Such an education would require a complete abandonment of the old ways and values. Havelock asserts:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ''psyche'' which slowly asserts itself in independence of the poetic performance and the poetised tradition had to be the reflective, thoughtful, critical psyche, or it could be nothing. Along with the discovery of the soul, Greece in Plato's day and just before Plato had to discover something else--the activity of sheer thinking. (''Preface to Plato'' 200)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Havelock later describes the discovery of the thinking soul as a shift from &quot;I am Achilles&quot; to &quot;I am thinking about Achilles.&quot; The profound social and cultural transformations engendered by this proto-Cartesianism cannot be understated.

Considering Havelock and Ong, then, one can form a more contextualized tenor for Book VII's famous &quot;allegory of the cave&quot;'s metaphorical vehicle. What holds society locked in place is the oral-poetic tradition. The reason Plato says so little about the &quot;masters&quot; is that they don't, in reality, exist. What holds us in place is not a despotic tyrant--rather it is a despotic tyranny enacted through our collective &quot;song.&quot; In Book VI of the ''Republic,'' Socrates argues to Adeimantus that the worst teachers of the worst customs are connected to public life (&quot;assemblies, courts, theaters, army camps&quot; (492b). Similar complaints echo throughout the ''Apology'' and the ''Gorgias.'' But the chief antagonist to philosophical reason is the ancient poetic and lyric traditions that, as Havelock notes, prevent oral humans from attaining the intellectual and moral autonomy that contemporary Western man takes for granted (''Muse Learns to Write'' 4).

It is important to recognize, in preparation for the next chapter, that Plato's critique of rhetoric centers around how it helps to maintain the anti-epistemic, profoundly uncritical, mimetic force of orality. The sophist, as it were, merely sings another song--one that duplicitously seems to recognize the possibility of individual action (say, voting in a democracy) yet usurps individual power in the name of the social group. It is on these grounds that Socrates condemns Gorgias, Polus, and Callicles in the ''Gorgias'', and it is in light of them that he refuses to prostrate himself in the ''Apology''. Consider Plato's vivid and damning description of &quot;sophist&quot; educators in Book VI: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Not one of those [...] whom the people call sophists [...] teaches anything other than the convictions that the majority express when they are gathered together. Indeed, these are precisely what the sophists call wisdom. It's as if someone were learning the moods and appetites of a huge, strong beast that he's rearing--how to approach and handle it, when it is most difficult to deal with or most gentle and what makes it so, what sounds it utters in either condition, and what sounds soothe or anger it. Having learned all this through tending the beast over a period of time, he calls this knack wisdom, gather his information together as if it were a craft, and starts to teach it. In truth, he knows nothing about which of these convictions is fine or shameful, good or bad, just or unjust, but he applies all these names in accordance with how the beast reacts--calling what it enjoys good and what angers it bad. He has no other account to give of these terms. And he calls what is compelled to do just and fine, for he hasn't seen and cannot show anyone else how much compulsion and goodness really differ. (493a-c)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In other words, from Plato's perspective rhetoric coerces &quot;I&quot;'s into a &quot;we.&quot; Dialectical philosophy, stimulated and carried forth by an other's active and interruptive voice, collects &quot;I&quot;'s into an ongoing conversation. It holds them as individuals, each accountable for thinking on his/her own. It is only through such active conversation that we can avoid the assimilative pitfalls of orality. 

The subjects Plato selects for learning all stress abstraction over sensual perception: arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, and (eventually) dialectic. With a few subjects, including astronomy and music, Plato is careful to insist that they are studied for their ability to summon abstract problems rather than studied either as perceptible bodies (in the case of astronomy), for their harmonious beauty (the case of music), or practicality (the case of geometry) (see 522-525). Plato repeatedly insists that education should not be a mere gaining of sight (see particularly his distinction between the visible and the intelligible at 532).This is, of course, connected to Plato's rigorous commitment to Being and opposition to becoming, stated in several places throughout Book VII.

Plato maintains that a student must study in these realms until the age of 30 before they are introduced to the dangerous, but necessary, art of argumentation. After five years of intensive training in argument, careful to avoid any sophistic or eristic defiencies, a student is prepared for dialectical examination. By age 50, those completing dialectical examination are deemed fit to rule.

Overall, Plato's metaphysical conception of logos inspires a political utopia. Plato argues that true philosophers care only for the pursuit of a &quot;good and rational life&quot; (521). Philosopher kings, far from desiring power, must be compelled to rule. Anyone who wants to rule is clearly unfit for the job (see VII 520e).

It is also important to stress that the education laid out in Book VII maintains Plato's virulent anti-democratism. Much like the red pill in Wachowski brothers' ''Matrix'', this is not an education for everyone. Only a select few, educated from birth, can ever hope to achieve (what Kant will call a few centuries later) &quot;enlightenment.&quot; The four qualities of the philosophic mind are explicitly covered in Book VI: &quot;courage, high-mindedness, ease in learning, and a good memory&quot; (490c). The final two are self-explanatory; &quot;courage&quot; is simply the ability to dare go against the sophistically-appeased &quot;oral&quot; beast. &quot;High-mindedness&quot; requires some explication. Echoing the sentiments expressed by Socrates in his ''Apology'' (addressed next chapter), the proper philosophic mind devotes no attention to material or earthly concerns. Such mindsets are described between 486a-c as slavish, petty, boasting, and even cowardly. Included in the high-minded orientation is a disregard for the value of one's life (and here the allusions to the ''Apology'' are strongest). Here we see support for Ong's &quot;dehumanization&quot; of Plato's ideas, since even human life (transient as it is) is seen as inferior to the dedication required to experience the transcendent, metaphysical Ideas. 

Finally, in terms of conceptualizing the role of rhetoric (or in this case, philosophy), in terms of education, Plato emphasizes that, while the philosopher must remain distinct from the crowd, s/he has an obligation to return to it and courageously engage members of the public in dialectic whenever possible. One might consider this pedagogical mandate as a precursor to the critical pedagogy by in large introduced to Rhetoric and Composition by Freire and intensified by cultural studies in the late 1980's and early 1990's (particularly in the work of people such as James Berlin and Henry Giroux).

== Dialogue 3==
'''Marcos''': Bom dia, doutor. Estou doente. &lt;br&gt;
'''Doutor''': Onde dói?&lt;br&gt;
'''Marcos''': As minhas pernas doem.  &lt;br&gt;
'''Doutor''': Tu tossiste ontem à noite?&lt;br&gt;
'''Marcos''': Sim.&lt;br&gt;
'''Doutor''': Tens gripe! Trata com o remédio verde em cima de minha mesa todo dia. &lt;br&gt;
'''Marcos''': Obrigado. Adeus!
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The doctor is treated with &quot;doutor&quot;. Sometimes with the name, but ever with &quot;doutor&quot;. (&quot;Doutor Souza&quot;).

The regular verb &quot;doer&quot; (to have pain in), is defective. It just exists in two conjugations. Singular (dói) and plural (doem).

Now, it is time to learn some new words:

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Example.jpg|Doer (verb), (a) dor = pain

File:De tuenda bona valetudine 1564 Illustrationen.jpg|Vomitar (verb), (o) vômito
File:Influenza virus.png|Gripar (verb, have a ''gripe''), (a) gripe
File:Cough medicine.jpg|(o) remédio
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Expressions==
&quot;Trata com (what) (frequence)&quot;
&quot;Treat it with (what) (frequence)&quot;

Frequence = (something)+ (number) + &quot;por&quot; + (intervals) 

I do it three times a week = Eu o faço três vezes por semana.

&quot;Tenho/Tens (what)&quot;
&quot;I/You have got (what)&quot;

The disease is determined with the verb to have (ter).

==Body vocabulary==
===Face/(a) cara ''or'' (o) rosto===
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Gray1205.png|(o) olho
File:Neus1.jpg|(o) nariz
File:Lower wisdom tooth.jpg|(o) dente
File:Teeth by David Shankbone.jpg|(a) boca
File:Swedish beard.jpg|(a) barba
File:Nietzsche187a.jpg|(o) bigode
File:Ear.jpg|(a) orelha
File:Skullfront.png|(a) cabeça
File:Coupescum.gif|(o) cabelo
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==[[Rotational Motion]]==
This is an exact duplicate of what you put at [[High School Physics/Rotational Motion]].  In addition, you note that you pulled it from Wikipedia but didn't provide a link for attribution.  That's not compliant with the Creative Commons license requiring attribution.  Also, is there enough information for an entire book on rotational motion or would it be better to simply add it to High School Physics alone? -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:51, 24 August 2009 (UTC)
:Just an FYI: all new content must be either solely licensed under the CC-BY-SA license or dual-licensed with that license and the GFDL because of the licensing change to Wikimedia sites.  The GFDL would be even more onerous, requiring the edit history and at that point forcing a [[WB:RFI|request for import]] before content would be available.  If you request future content to be imported from Wikipedia at that linked page you'll be covering both licenses. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:50, 25 August 2009 (UTC)
:Wikimedia wants to move to Creative Commons entirely and phase out the GFDL.

I got this idea from places like IHOP and Perkins, where they would have &quot;Homestyle Fried Potatoes&quot; on the menu.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 pound Russet potatoes, cut into 2 inch chunks
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 2 quarts olive oil ('''''not''''' extra virgin)
* Sour cream (optional)
* Chopped chives (optional)

== Procedure ==
#Place potatoes into a container of very cold water. Let sit until potatoes, when rinsed, give off clear water.
#Heat oil in a deep-fryer or a large pot to 325 degrees F. Add potatoes in batches and cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender and only very slightly browned. Drain on a cooling rack in a newspaper lined sheet pan.
#Boost oil temperature to 375 degrees F. Add potatoes again, in batches, and cook until golden brown and crispy.
#Once all potatoes have been fried and drained on the rack, sprinkle them very liberally with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Toss to coat, then serve with sour cream and chopped chives, if desired.</text>

'''Traffic Control Devices''' include street signs, traffic signals, and road markings. These signs, signals, and stripes guide drivers in navigation and control of their vehicles. Traffic signals are treated above in the section [[Fundamentals_of_Transportation/Traffic_Signals|Traffic Signals]]. Signs and stripings, the other controls, have usage described in the ''[[w:Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices|Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices]]'' (MUTCD). 


Road signs in the United States are standardized in the ''Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices'', the history of the evolution of this document is given in &lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, G. (1992a), “Evolution of the MUTCD: Early Editions of the
MUTCD”, ITE Journal , Vol. August, pp. 17–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, G. (1992b), “Evolution of the MUTCD: Early Standards for Traffic
Control Devices”, ITE Journal , Vol. July, pp. 23–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, G. (1992c), “Evolution of the MUTCD: The MUTCD since World
War II”, ITE Journal , Vol. November, pp. 17–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, G. (1994), “New Developments with the MUTCD”, ITE Journal ,
Vol. January, pp. 16–21.&lt;/ref&gt;. Signs evolved from local practice, cities and states copying neighbors, and inventing what they needed, and then later standardizing (first for rural and urban areas separately, and then jointly) after the value of coordination became apparent when automobile travelers crossed jurisdictional boundaries. From the first center line in Michigan in 1911, stop sign in 1915, a 1923 established the basis of the shapes used for road signs today. The Mississippi Valley Association of State Highway Departments proposed the following. Shapes which were most complex to make (circle, octagon) would indicate most danger and be used least often.

* Round: Used to warn of RR crossing; 
* Octagon: Used only to signify a stop; 
* Diamond: used to indicate ordinary condition of danger requiring precaution at all times; 
* Square: Used to indicate intermittent danger conditions requiring little more than ordinary care; 
* Rectangular: Used to indicate regulatory or directional information; 
* Cut-Out; Used a distinctive shape different from the above to identify highway routes.


This system was improved over time. In 1924 the Minnesota Department of Highways published its ''Manual of Markers and Signs'' with the same shapes, but the white background was made yellow. In 1924, the American Association of State Highway Officials adopted the MVASHD plan (with black on yellow), however Red and green on signs rejected because of visibility at night.

Separately, standards were being developed for cities. Traffic signals are largely an urban phenomenon. While the date of the first traffic signal is contested, the electric traffic signal appeared in  Cleveland in 1914, and the first three-color traffic signal in 1920. In 1924 the National Conference on Street and Highway Safety developed urban sign recommendations: 

* Stop = Red, 
* Proceed = Green, 
* Caution = Yellow, 
* Cross-Roads = Purple or other distinctive color. 
* Centerlines = White, but these were to be used only where it was unsafe to be on the left side of the road (curves, hill crests, intersections, railroad crossings)

The objective of AASHO in these early years was first to inventory all of the sign characteristics that had been locally deployed, and then to standardized various aspects: Shape, Word, Color, Symbol, Uniformity of Erection and Application. Even as late as 1930, the third National Conference on Street and Highway Safety, designed for urban  published a ''Manual on Street Traffic Signs, Signals and Markings'' which had either white or black paint for concrete, and white or yellow paint for bituminous. A red border and legend on yellow was suggested for stop signs. 

Finally, in 1932, a  Joint Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices met to rectify and combine the separate AASHO and NCSHS manuals for rural and urban traffic into a complete manual.  Main initial points were color codes, signs at night, and reduced sign sizes in urban areas. Visibility research was undertaken, sponsored by the Bureau of Public Roads. Minor changes continued after this date, though a modern driver would certainly understand the road at this point. For instance, in the 1954 MUTCD the stop sign changes from black on yellow to white on red; yield sign introduced as triangle (black on yellow), emulating European standards.

This table reviews some of the key decisions in the creation of the ''Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices''.

==Roundabouts==

===History of Roundabouts===
The use of the modern roundabouts began in the 1980s which saw a widespread use in Europe and Australia, and while the United States began implementing the modern roundabout in the early 1990s, their original conception came from the rotaries and traffic circles which were used during early 1900s to 1940s.  The modern roundabout is defined as an island in the center traffic where cars enter that area and travel counterclockwise before choosing their exit.&lt;ref&gt;{Minnesota LRRB Research Implementation Committee | url=http://www.mnltap.umn.edu/publications/videos/modernroundabouts/}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many designs which are used for roundabouts depending on circumstances such as traffic congestion, crash and fatality rate, and geographical area.
The different designs are as follows: &lt;ref&gt;{Roundabouts: An informational guide | url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/00067/00067.pdf }&lt;/ref&gt;
*Mini-roundabouts
*Urban compact roundabouts
*Urban single-lane roundabouts
*Urban double-lane roundabouts
*Rural single-lane roundabouts
*Rural double-lane roundabouts

===Reasons for using Roundabouts===

The main purpose for using roundabouts is to ease the flow of traffic in certain areas, but there are also many advantages to having roundabouts rather than intersections ranging from safety matters to environmental issues.
The drawbacks of installing roundabouts are mainly cleanup duty and the cost.  States which experience heavy snowfall and severe weather conditions will be forced to do extra cleanup work as the area taken by roundabouts are generally larger than intersections.  Also, the cost of constructing roundabouts can be expensive in some areas, were it is estimated roundabouts cost on average $317,000, while the cost of installing an intersection is pegged at an average of $300,000.
However, installing roundabouts offers suitable solutions to city planners in many ways. The major concern for city planners is the safety of all people involved in vehicle conflicts.  Two-lane Intersections generate 32 conflict points while roundabouts generate 8 conflict points between vehicles only, which results in 75% less possible crashes that rise from these conflicts.  In addition, roundabouts provide less pedestrian to vehicle conflicts as the crosswalks in the roundabouts are farther away from the flow of traffic, and its placement shows potential conflicts with oncoming vehicles that are planning to enter the roundabout.&lt;ref&gt;{Minnesota LRRB Research Implementation Committee | url=http://www.mnltap.umn.edu/publications/videos/modernroundabouts/}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such measures that are implicitly built in the roundabout design provide greater safety to the vehicles as well as the pedestrians.  Also, the nature of the roundabout forces oncoming traffic to slow down to enter it, thereby eliminating traffic congestion and the use of stop signs.  Yield signs are used instead of stop signs, which during heavy traffic may cause congestion, and yield sign allows vehicles to drive freely if the space in the roundabout is available.
The environmental aspect of roundabouts can be considerable depending on the traffic flow and number of vehicles that use the.  The Insurance institute for highway safety states that studies have shown roundabouts reduce the consumption of fuel by 235,000 gallons in one year as opposed to intersection when the study was conducted on intersection that were to be converted to roundabouts . &lt;ref&gt;{Minnesota LRRB Research Implementation Committee | url=http://www.mnltap.umn.edu/publications/videos/modernroundabouts/}&lt;/ref&gt;
There reasons are simple, continuous flow of traffic reduces traffic delays and vehicles stops, which in turn reduces the amount of fuel burned by the vehicle as opposed to when it is still at an intersection waiting for a green light.  Therefore, having roundabouts can be environmentally friendly and economically sound for vehicle operators.

===Safety Statistics:===
Roundabouts offer less conflicts among vehicles and pedestrians, therefore naturally crashes tend to be reduced.  Based on 10 samples, the average crash rate in roundabouts is 0.13 crashes per million vehicles, which present 40% less crashes, 75% less crashes with injuries and almost no fatalities when compared to intersection due to the fact that roundabouts eliminate the possibility of vehicles colliding head on.  The only type of roundabout collision experienced would be a side collision which in general is much safer than a head on collision.  &lt;ref&gt;{Minnesota LRRB Research Implementation Committee | url=http://www.mnltap.umn.edu/publications/videos/modernroundabouts/}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerns about Roundabouts:===
While roundabouts reduce conflict possibilities, they do not eliminate them.  The disregard for stop signs allows reckless drivers to drive through roundabouts without paying attention to traffic within the roundabout, which may cause problems.  In addition, the size of the island which vehicles drive around may block the line of sight of vehicles trying to enter the roundabout, which under some circumstances may cause crashes.  Finally, the location and size of the roundabout has to be considered carefully before being implemented as certain vehicles (large trucks, firefighter trucks, emergency vehicles etc) may have difficulties driving around the roundabouts if they were improperly placed.
Finally, in 1972, the town Swindon in the United Kingdom saw the installation of the first &quot;magic roundabout&quot; which consisted of six mini-roundabouts which are installed around one central island where drivers drive counterclockwise around the central island and clockwise around the mini-roundabouts. &lt;ref&gt;{The Magic Roundabout | url=http://www.swindonweb.com/index.asp?m=8&amp;s=115&amp;ss=289}&lt;/ref&gt;  although Swindon residents find the roundabout quite useful, tourists as well as outsiders have consistently complained about the dangers that might rise from such a roundabout since it is one of a kind, and not all drivers are accustomed to operating vehicles around such a roundabout.  A poll conducted by the Britannia Rescue places the Magic Roundabout at the fourth scariest road in 2009. &lt;ref name=&quot;scary&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8382506.stm|title=Britain's scariest roads revealed |accessdate=2009-11-27|date=2009-11-27 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pedestrian Access===
The research findings on pedestrian safety at roundabouts are somewhat unclear. There have been relatively few studies, mostly conducted in Europe, concerning pedestrians and roundabouts. Pedestrian-vehicle crashes, the most commonly used dependent measure in pedestrian safety studies, tend to occur infrequently both before and after an intersection is converted to a roundabout. As a result, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from the literature regarding pedestrian safety and roundabouts. One issue that is often not considered in pedestrian research is the degree to which pedestrian volume changes when intersections with signal or stop-sign control are converted to roundabouts. There is a need for research on this topic as well as a broad range of other pedestrian-related concerns at roundabouts. Little is known about the effect of roundabouts on older pedestrians, children, and pedestrians with disabilities. Anecdotal evidence indicates that many Australian engineers (who have extensive experience with roundabouts) consider these intersections to be unsuitable if large numbers of pedestrians are present, however some improvements can be helpful especially when considering pedestrians with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{http://www.access-board.gov/research/roundabouts/bulletin.htm}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improvements for wayfinding

*Well-defined walkway edges
*Separated walkways, with landscaping at street edge to preclude prohibited crossings to center island
*Tactile markings across sidewalk to identify crossing locations
*Bollards or architectural features to indicate crossing locations
*Detectable warnings (separate at splitter islands) at street edge
*Perpendicular crossings ; where angled, use curbing for alignment cues
*High-contrast markings
*Pedestrian lighting
&lt;ref&gt;{http://www.access-board.gov/research/roundabouts/bulletin.htm}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orientation and mobility techniques used by blind individuals at traditional intersections rely heavily on traffic sounds. When traffic signals and stop signs regulate traffic movements at intersections, the resulting breaks in traffic flow provide identifiable and predictable periods – gaps – during which pedestrians can cross. Such predictable breaks do not usually occur at roundabouts, and so pedestrians must make judgments about the speed and travel paths of approaching vehicles (and the duration of gaps between vehicles). It appears that sighted adults are generally able to safely make such judgments, although some pedestrians may have difficulty doing so. Research suggests that the selection of appropriate gaps at roundabouts is problematic for blind pedestrians at some roundabouts.  &lt;ref&gt;{http://www.access-board.gov/research/roundabouts/bulletin.htm}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ingredients ==
* 9 1/2 ounces all-purpose flour, approximately 2 cups 
* 2 teaspoons baking powder 
* 3/4 teaspoon salt 
* 2 1/2 ounces shortening, approximately 6 tablespoons 
* 3/4 cup milk 
* 1 egg mixed with 1 to 2 teaspoons water 
* 2 quarts canola oil
* Apple Filling (recipe below)
* Powdered sugar

== Procedure ==
#In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, baking powder and salt. Pulse for a few seconds and then pour into a large mixing bowl.
#Add the shortening and knead it into the flour with your hands until it is crumbly.
#Add the milk all at once and mix in with a spatula until it begins to come together.
#Lightly flour your hands and the countertop and turn the dough out onto the countertop.
#Knead the dough ball, folding over 10 to 20 times. Using a rolling pin roll the dough to 1/3 to 1/2-inch thickness, then cut into rounds using a 2 1/4-inch ring.
#Roll each round as thinly as possible or to 5 to 6 inches in diameter. Spoon 1 to 2 tablespoons of filling onto the dough, brush the edges of half of the dough lightly with the egg wash, fold over and seal the edges together with the tines of a fork, dipping it into flour as needed. 
#Gently press down to flatten and evenly distribute the filling. Dock the top of the pies with a fork.
#Heat vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or a large heavy pot to 375 degrees F. Once hot, add 1 to 2 pies at a time and fry until golden brown, approximately 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on a cooling rack.
#Once all pies have been fried, place sugar in a bowl. Roll each pastry in the sugar and serve.

== Filling ==

===Ingredients===
* 2 cups peeled and chopped apple
* 1 cup sugar
* 1/2 cup apple juice
* 1 tsp freshly ground cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp freshly grated nutmeg
===Procedure===
#Place all of the ingredients into a small saucepan over high heat and bring to a boil.
#Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
#Transfer to a bowl and place in refrigerator to cool completely before using as filling.</text>

Dear 98.227.67.107,

I see you had big plans for a series of books

* Linux For Newbies
* Linux For Users
* Linux For Power Users

I think Wikibooks has room for several books on Linux for readers at various levels of familiarity.
Perhaps you will also be interested in helping us improve the other Linux books here:
* [[Linux Guide]]
* [[Embedded Systems/Linux]]
* [[Operating System Design/Case Studies/Linux]]
* [[The Linux Kernel]]
* [[Inside Linux Kernel]]
* [[Linux From Scratch]]
* [[Online Linux Connect]]
* [[Running with Linux]]
* [[Puppy Linux]]
* [[Using Ubuntu Linux]]
* [[Linux Networking How-To]]
* [[LPI Linux Certification]]
* [[Linux Kernel Drivers Annotated]]
* [[Updating the Linux kernel]]
* [[Linux Guide/Linux and Bluetooth]]
* [[Introduction to 2D Linux Game Programming]]
* [[Configuring Sound on Linux]]
* [[Guide to Unix/Linux]]
* [[A Neutral Look at Operating Systems/Linux]]
* [[Linux Audio: A Guide For Beginner and Beyond]]
* [[FOSS Open Standards/The Linux Standard Base]]
* [[PSP Programming/Linux]]
* [[Computer Programming/Linux Programming]]
* [[FOSS A General Introduction/Linux]]

I hope you don't mind me mashing together some of the 1/2 done books, including the books you worked on, in an attempt to put together a 3/4 done book on some important facet of Linux. :-)
Again, welcome.

== Ingredients ==
* 2 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2 inch pieces
* 3/4 cup brown sugar
* 1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
* 4 ounces unsalted butter, cut into pieces
* 1 tsp freshly ground cinnamon

== Procedure ==
#Cover potatoes in a large pot with cold water by at least an inch.
#Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until potatoes are tender, about 15-20 minutes.
#Drain potatoes into a colander. Remove water from pot and add potatoes and remaining ingredients. Mash potatoes with either an immersion blender or potato masher.
#If you used a potato masher, combine ingredients thoroughly. If you did not, then you can skip this step.
#Serve immediately.</text>

==  Brahms Lullaby (Interpretation from German) == 

: Lulla- {{crd|C}} by, and good night,

: With pink {{crd|F}}roses be-{{crd|C}}dight,

: With {{crd|G}}lilies overspread,

: Is my {{crd|G7}}baby's wee, sweet {{crd|C}}head.


:: Lay you {{crd|F}} down now, and {{crd|C}} rest,

:: May your {{crd|G}} slumber be {{crd|C}} blessed!

:: Lay you {{crd|F}} down now, and {{crd|C}}rest,

:: May thy {{crd|G}} slumber be {{crd|C}} blessed!


: Lulla-{{crd|C}}by, and good night,

: You're your {{crd|F}}mother's de-{{crd|C}}light,

: Shining {{crd|G}} angels beside

: My {{crd|G7}}darling a-{{crd|C}}bide.


:: Soft and {{crd|F}}warm is your {{crd|C}}bed,

:: Close your {{crd|G}}eyes and rest your {{crd|C}}head.

:: Soft and {{crd|F}}warm is your {{crd|C}}bed,

:: Close your {{crd|G}}eyes and rest your {{crd|C}}head.

==  Brahms Lullaby (novelly poetry ) == 

: Sleepy-{{crd|C}}head, close your eyes.

: Mother's {{crd|F}}right here be-{{crd|C}}side you.

: I'll pro-{{crd|G}}tect you from harm,

: You will {{crd|G7}}wake in my {{crd|C}}arms.

:: Guardian {{crd|F}}angels are {{crd|C}}near,

:: So sleep {{crd|G}}on, with no {{crd|C}}fear.

:: Guardian {{crd|F}}angels are {{crd|C}}near,

:: So sleep {{crd|G}}on, with no {{crd|C}}fear.


: Lulla-{{crd|C}}by, and sleep tight.

: Hush! My {{crd|F}}darling is {{crd|C}}sleeping,

: On his {{crd|G}}sheets white as cream,

: With his {{crd|G7}}head full of {{crd|C}}dreams.


:: When the {{crd|F}}sky's bright with {{crd|C}}dawn,

:: He will {{crd|G}}wake in the {{crd|C}}morning.

:: When {{crd|F}}noontide warms the {{crd|C}}world,

:: He will {{crd|G}}frolic in the {{crd|C}}sun.



== Brahms Gutenachtlied (German Original)==

:Guten {{crd|C}} Abend, gut Nacht 

:Mit {{crd|F}} Rosen be- {{crd|C}} dacht 

:Mit {{crd|G}} Nelken bedeckt 

:Schlupf {{crd|G7}} unter die {{crd|C}} Deck 

::Morgen {{crd|F}} früh wenn Gott {{crd|C}} will 

::Wirst du {{crd|G}} wieder ge- {{crd|C}} weckt 

::Morgen {{crd|F}} früh wenn Gott {{crd|C}} will 

::Wirst du {{crd|G}} wieder ge- {{crd|C}} weckt 

:Guten {{crd|C}} Abend, gut Nacht 

:Von {{crd|F}} Englein be- {{crd|C}} wacht 

:Die {{crd|G}} zeigen im Traum 

:Dir  {{crd|G7}} Christkindleins {{crd|C}} Baum 

::Schlaf nur {{crd|F}} selig und {{crd|C}} süss 

::Schau im {{crd|G}} Traum's Para- {{crd|C}} dies 

::Schlaf nur {{crd|F}} selig und {{crd|C}} süss 

::Schau im {{crd|G}} Traum's Para- {{crd|C}} dies

{{recipe}}

'''Bachelor Fish Stew''' is appallingly easy to make, very flexible, and very nutritious (due to the oily fish, beans, and tomatoes).

== Ingredients ==

* 1 400g (240 drained) tin of beans (kidney, soya, black eye, chickpeas etc) in brine
* 1 400g tin of tomatoes (chopped or plum)
* 1 120g tin of mackerel fillets in tomato sauce
* 1 tsp curry powder (or to taste)
* salt, pepper, anything else to taste

== Procedure ==

Open all the tins without cutting yourself. Drain any that don't involve tomato sauce or juice.

Empty everything into a saucepan, remembering to remove the lid first, bring to the boil, then cover and simmer, stirring occasionally until hot enough to eat (5-10 minutes).

No real cooking is involved because all the tinned produce should be cooked already.

== Notes, tricks, and variations ==

* Any oily fish will work - sardines, etc.

* You can add anything that can cook by being boiled - an egg, vegetables chopped to about 1&quot;, smallish broccoli florets, etc. But you'll need to simmer long enough to cook the additions - probably 20 minutes will do.

* If you're feeling advanced, chop and fry an onion in the saucepan with a knob of butter and the curry powder before adding everything else.

* Serve with pasta to feed more people; probably best to cook the pasta separately.

      <comment>/* Operation */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Automated lighting is very popular within the industry because of how versatile it is. Instead of having to rig and focus many generic (non-automated) fittings with different coloured gels or gobos, designers can now use one light to get the colours they desire, with the benefit of having many more features. (Such as gobos, the ability to move the lights for visual effect.) Combining the differing properties in different ways gives the user the ability to create different looks, feel and effects using just one fitting. Originally, automated lights were commonly known as &quot;intelligent&quot; lights. Many in the lighting industry felt this was mis-leading as this type of fitting does not do any &quot;thinking&quot;, they do what they are &quot;told&quot; to by the control desk. This is done via the [[DMX512]] protocol. 

== Operation ==
Almost all automated lights have many and various functions and capabilities. For example, an automated light might have several different colours, pan and tilt functions, zoom, gobos, and shutter options. Usually each of these properties is assigned a DMX512 channel by the firmware in the light itself. Eg.

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''DMX512&lt;br&gt;Offset''' &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  '''Property'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;+0 =&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  Intensity (Usually acheived with a shutter.)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;+1 = &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; Colour (Usually, dichoric glass colours placed on the outside of a wheel.)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;+2 =&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  Pan (Side to side movement.)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;+3 =&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  Tilt (Up/down movement.)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;+4 =&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  Gobo (A beam shapng device.)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;+5 =&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  Zoom&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;+6 =&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  Focus&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;+7 =&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;  Control (Lamp ON/OFF, Reset.)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
Firstly, the fitting must be assigned a DMX number, eg 10. This means when the control desk changes the value of channel 10, the intensity of the light (shown as an example above) will change also. Channel 11 will change the colour, 12 will make the light move left and right, 13 will tilt the light, 14 will change the gobo and 15 will change the zoom.

Exactly how the changes are made and to what degree vary from light to light, manufacturer to manufacturer.

== Pros ==
There are many pros to using automated lighting:
*Time saving:
**Focus can be done from the desk.
**Fewer fitting required to rig as gobo washes or specials.
**Fewer powercables to run.

*Asthetics:
**Far more looks avaiable to the operator or designer, this is the major reason for using them.


== Cons ==
There are also a few cons to consider:
*Expense: automated lighting costs far more than generics to purchase or hire. An experienced technician is required to program automated lights.
*Weight: usually far heavier than an average generic.
*Reliance on a DMX chain: one malfunctioning DMX lead can prevent an entire rig from functioning.
*High maintenance: automated lights have many moving parts and so require a good maintenance schedule.

&lt;math&gt;Trips  = B_1 Off + B_2 Ind + B_3 Ret&lt;/math&gt;

And you are given the following coefficients derived from a regression model.

 B_1 = 0.61
 B_2 = 0.15
 B_3 = 0.123

If there are 600 office employees, 300 industrial employees, and 200 retail employees, how many trips are going from work to home?

# Explain why the graph of density vs. speed at a bottleneck is not linear using queueing theory.
# Define time headway and space headway.
# Why do we need two different speed measures, define each, which is more appropriate?  How are these measures related?
# What are the 3 fundamental principles of traffic flow? What are their relationships?
# What does the slope on the space time diagram tell you?
# What is the difference between looking at traffic as a particle rather than a flow?
# Define density.
# As density increases, what happens to flow?
# Where are time-space diagrams used?
# What is space headway on a space-time diagram? What is time headway?
# What does high density mean?
#  Draw a realistic speed vs. density graph? Compare it with the traditional model.
# Describe headway speed?
# How does a bottleneck affect traffic flow upstream of the point?
# What might cause a falloff of flow as density rises?
# Why does density reach a maximum when flow is zero?
# How do these analysis of mathematical relationships between q,k,v  help in planning, design, and operations of road?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Additional Questions ==

# What example or explanation can be given for shockwaves on freeways?
# Explain the 4 phases of traffic diagram and why each has the slope it has.
# How do microscopic and macroscopic models of traffic flow differ?
# Why does flow decrease in phase 3 of the traffic phase diagram?
# What types of events can create rolling roadblocks?
# How is speed calculated from a flow v. density diagram?
# What is a shockwave and how do you compute its speed?
# Can service rate decrease with increasing congestion?
# What factors affect the wave speed?
# What does the slope of the shockwave represent in the graph?
# Is it possible to increase the density of the queue and still have the shockwave going downstream?  What would be a an example of this?
# Why is the bottleneck QK curve projected on the mainroad QB curve to find the speed?
# What is Greenshields model, does it accurately predict traffic flow?
# What is the phase in traffic flow, after density is at its max, called?
# What happens to speed when the density  increases?
# What does the slope represent in a traffic phase diagram
# Give an example of density rising and speed dropping
# What is &lt;math&gt;v_w&lt;/math&gt; ?
# What does it mean when the flow rate begins to decrease in the traffic phase diagram?
# During the bottleneck phase, what happens to flow as density increases? (flow remains constant)
# How can you tell if the queue grows with or against traffic?
# Does the bottleneck always slow traffic?
# How can traffic avoid the bottleneck?
# How do incidents and rolling roadblocks affect shockwaves differently?
# How do speed, density, and flow change during the peak hour
# List  six examples where gaps are important.

      <comment>Crest Vertical Curves</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Additional Questions ==

=== Sag Vertical Curves ===
# What are the considerations when designing sag vertical curves? Which is most important?
# What does the comfort criteria in a sag vertical curve describe? Is there a time when comfort criterion is the determining factor? Is there a time when the appearance criteria is determining? 
# What values are used for H and b in determining L for sag vertical curve?
# When calculating SSD, which grade should be used? 
# Is it true that whether a curve is a crest or sag vertical curve is determined by the initial and final grade?
# Are properties of headlights different for cars and trucks?  → design for worst case (shorter car).  Headlights are positioned by vehicle.  Some vehicles have driver adjustments.  Design is for normal headlights, not highbeams.
# Why are there different equations for L depending on S&gt;L, S&lt;L
# Is there any trick to knowing whether S&lt;L or S&gt;L before starting?
# How does rain/fog affect sight distance? → reduces it, so drivers should reduce speed and be more alert.  Design is for normal conditions.
# What is the drainage criterion?  How is water dealt with on sag curves?
#  Why are headlights angled?

=== Crest Vertical Curves ===
# Is there a limit on hill crests??
# What is the difference between crest and sag curves
# How can you determine if S &gt; L or S &lt; L when doing SSD calculations? --&gt; If don’t know, trial and check.  If use S &gt; L equation and S is greater than L, great, otherwise, must solve again. Why are equations different?  Think about the relationships.  Solve them at S = L.
# If SSD or PSD is different in opposite directions over a crest vertical curve, is it common to have different speed limits/ warning signs. Usually speed is same in both directions, not always.
# Is darkness considered in speed/stopping calculations (since can’t see as far)? For Sag curves, there is a headlight criterion.
# What height is used in equations for L?
# Can the highest point on the curve be higher than the PVI? →:(No, but can be higher than the point on the curve under the PVI). How is it possible for the PVI elevation to be above the actual elevation
# When is SSD different from AASHTO guidelines? Do engineers assume different stopping sight distances under certain conditions? 
# Why compute SSD for downgrade only?
# Why is it not always possible to allow passing on vertical curve two lane roads.  Is passing sight regularly used ? → (on 2 lane rural roads with good sight lines, yes).
# Explain idea of stopping sign as it pertains to hills with (horizontal) curves → a bit complex for intro to transportation, covered in 4xxx level curve.  Think about which governs, the horizontal SSD or the vertical SSD (i.e. whichever is lower, which depends on local conditions).  Is passing sight distance based on big trucks or average sized cars? → cars (see h1 and compare it with where you are sitting in the vehicle).  (Do trucks and small cars have enough sight to pass). → It is not the size of the car you are in so much as the size of the car you see (h2).  You are more likely to see a big truck, so the equation is conservative for larger vehicles. When do you plan for each?  (Always plan for SSD, consider PSD when there is possibility of dashed yellow line).
# What are 3 parameters that affect the design of vertical curves
# Explain crest vertical curve graphically
# Determine the minimum length of the curve.
# What type of curve is used in the design of crest vertical curves?  (Ans: Parabola)
# Why is it necessary to curve roads that have different slopes on either side of the curve?
# Is L Arc length or horizontal displacement?
# Why is stopping distance important?
# Label PVC, PVI and PVT on a graph. What is the difference between PVC and PVT?
# What is an equal tangent cuve
# What does an aesthetically unappealing curve look like?
# What does SSD depend on?
# How does variable “a” used in elevation, differ from variable “A” used in length of curve.
# In what two ways can the SSD and L be related
# What is the first step in developing the profile of a curve -&gt; Find the center of the curve.

=== Additional Problem ===

# Compute length of crest vertical curve with +2.5% and –2.% grade, speed = 90 km/hr &amp;S &lt; L, f=0.25, PRT = 2.5 sec
## Find the elevation along the curve?
## Find the highest point on a crest vertical curve

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Additional Questions ==
 
# Name 4 types of horizontal curves.  
# When are the non-simple types most used? Why are reverse curves so bad? → Special applications, including mountains, restricted right-of-way, or anywhere that a simple curve cannot be feasibly used. 
# How is weather accounted for (e.g. ice) → superelevation (e)
# Explain m?  When would m and M be equal? Are the equations for “m” used in determining the placement of buildings or billboards on existing roadways?  → Used as a justification to keep stuff off the side of the road.  May be used in roadway construction to avoid unmovable objects, or when placing objects to avoid unmovable road.
# When should you design speed for curves rather than the curve for speed? → If it is new construction, design the radius to serve the desired speed.  If you are setting speed limits, set the speed based on the existing curve.
# When the angle increases, does the tangent length increase or decrease
# Write the constraints on the calculation of horizontal curves
# What are the characteristics of horizontal curves
#Draw a simple horizontal curve and its components.
# Can one add T to the PI station to get the station of the PC?  (No)
# How common is a horizontal curve on a vertical curve? → Depends on where you are, very common in mountainous areas.  Not especially uncommon.
# Are most horizontal curves designed using circles? → (In US, almost uniformly yes. It is also easier for driver, who just needs to set the steering wheel, constant readjustment is not required )
# In English Units what does station 10+25 mean? It indicates the station is 1025 feet from 0+00.
# On concrete roads there are grooves  perpendicular to the direction of traffic to increase stopping road friction.  Do these grooves (rumblestrips) reduce side friction? 
# What is maximum superelevation when a road is really icy? → superelevation cannot change seasonally (it would be too expensive to jack up the road).  So Max &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is annual.
# Why are side friction factors for urban and rural roads different? What are different factors in rural vs. urban areas?
# Why is Radius of curvature important when building roads?
# What are some of the highest values of e and &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt; around the country?
# Why do the standards (maximums/minimums) for e and &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt; change with location?
# Label all of the forces acting on a vehicle traveling up a hill (and around a corner)
# What is curve resistance? What affects is? Why does it matter?
# What are the main variables used in curvature problems, superelevation?
# Why do engineers bank curves?
# What is centrifugal force?
# Why would an engineer want to increase or decrease the radius of curvature?
# What does superelevation represent
# What shapes do horizontal and vertical curves have.  Why is this helpful for the driver
# If you want to decrease &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, what strategies do you have?
# Is side friction the same as static friction? What does it mean?
# When the max value of &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is given, can a smaller number be used in the final answer → yes
# What is superelevation? How is it affected by centrifugal force?
# How does &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt; affect design speeds

# For the autobahn in Germany are the roads designed with a high design speed or do they let people operate above the design speed? Yes
# Are AASHTO guidelines law?  Not as such, though it is considered state of practice, each state DOT adopts them independently, so when new guidelines are developed, state may still be using older documents.  However, not adhering to engineering practice without good reason may be grounds for a lawsuit against the state (the state willing).
# Is state DOT liable for accidents occurring due to roads not being wide enough? Potentially.
# Are vertical curves or horizontal curves used more often in highway design? (I don’t know, I suspect vertical, since streets are often in a grid).
# If the largest vehicle uses the road once a year, do we consider it a design vehicle. Probably not, it would generally be easier to note it as a wide vehicle or a long vehicle, or a tall vehicle…
# Has road heating ever been considered for ice repellent in cold regions?  Yes, but costly, risk of breakdown in heating system … would require breaking road to repair.  Done in some places (driveways, sidewalks, ramps, bridges). Typically Europe or Japan, don’t know of US road applications.  Some commercial firms, e.g. [http://www.mechaheat.nl/ Mechaheat] do this.
# Does the change in slope of a vertical curve have a large effect on the coefficient of friction? (As the slope changes there has to be a change on the vertical force on the car)
# How does the coefficient of friction come into play while designing the downslope of vertical curves?
# What is right-of-way
# Give six functions/advantages of medians.
# What is the difference between roadside barriers and median barriers Why are they used?
# What is the difference between design speed and running speed?
# What are lane widths for arterials and two-lane roadways?
# Draw the cross-section elements in a highway design?
# Common cross slopes for roadbeds are usually measured at ___ degrees.
# What are the types of side slopes? What is their function?
# What are the two distinct functions of streets and highways: movement and access. What are the functional classes of roads (name 3).
# What book is considered to be the bible of highway design?
# What are curb cut controls on highway or freeway?
# When is a guard rail implemented?
# Give 9 factors influencing highway design?
# Why is sloping the road important? What does it prevent?
# How are road sloped along the side of a mountain? What will have to drain down the mountain, but is it safe this way?  Are roads sometimes sloped into the mountain with water draining underneath via pipes and drainage channels?  Yes 
# What is an equal tangent curve?
# What are two types of vertical curves? Draw a crest vertical curve.
# How are PVI, PVC, PVT described by stationing?
# What is recommended lane width. Explain the advantages/disadvantages of narrow lanes
# What is design hourly volume based on?
# Why are foreslopes and backslopes necessary.
# Does climate affect design speed?  Yes, design speed in cold weather, snow and ice, probably lower than in summer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Additional Questions ==

# What is maximum grade a vehicle can travel, what effects it? Explain how to find maximum grade at a given speed.  Explain what each variable means and how it contributes to figuring max grade.  
# Why are &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_D&lt;/math&gt; the only things need to calculate air resistance.  → Because it is a crude approximation of aerodynamics.  Real aerodynamics are of course  complicated, but the additional detail does not sufficiently improve accuracy.
# If there were no heavy vehicles, would planners design roads with steeper grades? → Yes, they should. There has been discussion for a number of years for separate car and truck highways, since car-only highways would be cheaper and truck-only highways could avoid congestion.  However additional rights of way would be required
# Define rolling resistance. Why is rolling resistance different for cars and trucks?   What is the difference between rolling resistance and maximum grade?
# What is the relationship between available power and nominal power? Why do trucks use more of their nominal power than cars.
# What is the mass/power ratio used for?
# What happens if air resistance is larger than tractive effort force.
# What is maximum grade a road can have?
# What forces affect vehicle motion?
# What are two relevant parameters for passenger car, type &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;?
# Define &lt;math&gt;F_r&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;F_a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;F_t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;F_g&lt;/math&gt;. 
# If given a grade of 3%, should you use 0.03 or 3 in the equation?
# How does coefficient of rolling resistance vary between vehicles. 
# What kind of safety factors are in these equations.

# What happens if an accident is caused by poorly designed roads? → Lawsuits
# Explain Stopping Sight Distance again → = perception reaction distance + braking distance
# Isn’t 200 m long distance for braking → Yes unless very high speed on very slick surface (or going downhill).
# Is higher coefficient of friction used in road design? → Not too often, more often taken as a function of materials and construction, and wear and tear on road (older roads have less friction).
# Does coefficient of friction properly account for the ways cars brakes work and the manner in which drivers apply the brakes?
# Are stopping distance (related to accident reconstruction) admissible as evidence in court? Would this be by a licensed professional engineer?  → Yes
# How close are accident reconstruction calculations to be actual accidents? → Should be on average correct …
# For stopping distance, why don’t we have a factor to include vehicle size and weight?
# Why would the grade “G” be positive in the stopping distance equation? What would the sign be in the Stopping Distance Equation. What does a negative grade mean if you are were assuming to be going downhill?
# Describe the interaction between gravity and friction when going up or downhill. Is friction helped or hindered?
# Why can cosine and sine be ignored in calculations? --&gt; Small angle approximations.
# What are the steps in accident reconstruction
# If you have an accident reconstruction problem, do you incorporate grade when finding friction? Yes, but the grade is known.
# How are skid marks useful in determining initial speed of vehicle?
# What affects the friction force?
# What can stopping distance measure be used for?
# What effect does grade have on stopping distance?
# What if more or less skid-marks found at an accident scene.  How are averages computed when distances are far apart?

      <comment>/* Questions #3 and #4, Monopoly Pricing */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Quiz #1 (Self-Assessment)

== Questions #1 and #2, Supply and Demand  ==
1.	Demand is given by &lt;math&gt;Q_D = 100 - P&lt;/math&gt;. Supply is given by &lt;math&gt;Q_S = 3 P&lt;/math&gt;. Draw supply and demand, and solve graphically and algebraically for equilibrium price and quantity.

* Algebraically, we can solve for the two quantities being equal: &lt;math&gt;Q_D = Q_S \Rightarrow 100 - P^{e} = 3 P^{e} \Rightarrow P^{e} = 25 &lt;/math&gt;.
* Then, the equilibrium quantity can come out of either the demand or supply function: &lt;math&gt;Q_D = 100 - 25 = 75&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Supply_Demand_example_01.svg]]

2.	Suppose supply decreases so that &lt;math&gt;Q_S = 3 P - 24&lt;/math&gt;. Draw the shift in supply and solve graphically and algebraically for the new equilibrium price and quantity.

* To draw, shift the supply curve by noticing that the new supply curve has the same slope as the old one (3, or 1/3 depending on perspective) and solving &lt;math&gt;Q_S = 0&lt;/math&gt; to find the new intercept at &lt;math&gt;P = 8&lt;/math&gt;.
* Algebraically: &lt;math&gt;Q_D = Q_S \Rightarrow 100 - P^{e} = 3 P^{e} - 24 \Rightarrow 4 P^{e} = 124 \Rightarrow P^{e} = 31&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;Q_D = 100 - 31 = 69&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Supply_Demand_example_02.svg]]

== Questions #3 and #4, Monopoly Pricing ==

3.	Suppose there is a monopolist facing the demand given by &lt;math&gt;Q_D = 100 - P&lt;/math&gt;, and cost of production is &lt;math&gt;1000 + 20 Q&lt;/math&gt;. Find marginal revenue (MR) and marginal cost (MC). Draw the monopolist’s decision problem and solve graphically and numerically for the profit-maximizing quantity and price.

* Revenue is simply price times quantity, but there's a hitch. Since we want to find ''marginal revenue'', that is the change in revenue from an increase in quantity, we need the revenue function to be in terms of quantity, not in terms of price. So, the first thing is to take the demand function &lt;math&gt;Q_D = 100 - P&lt;/math&gt; and turn it into the inverse demand function &lt;math&gt;P = 100 - Q_D&lt;/math&gt;.
* Then &lt;math&gt;R = P Q = (100 - Q) Q = 100 Q - Q^2&lt;/math&gt;.
* Marginal revenue is the derivative with respect to quantity: &lt;math&gt;MR = \frac{dR}{dQ} = 100 - 2 Q&lt;/math&gt;.
* Marginal cost is similarly the derivative of total cost with respect to quantity: &lt;math&gt;MC = \frac{dC}{dQ} = 20&lt;/math&gt;.
* Solving algebraically, the monopolist maximizes profit where &lt;math&gt;MR = MC: 100 - 2 Q = 20; Q^{*} = 40&lt;/math&gt;
* To get a quantity of 40, we look back at the inverse demand function to find the price, and the monopolist sets a price of &lt;math&gt;P^{*} = 60&lt;/math&gt;.

4.	On the graph, identify the producer’s surplus, the consumer’s surplus, and the deadweight loss. How much is each?

== Questions #5 and #6, Expected Utility ==

5.	Suppose that Anne has a utility of money (in dollars) given by &lt;math&gt;U(m) = (m)^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;. What is her utility for a lottery ticket which pays $100 with probability 1/5, and otherwise nothing?

* &lt;math&gt;U(lottery) = (1/5) 100^{\frac{1}{2}} + (4/5) 0^{\frac{1}{2}} = (1/5) 10 = 2&lt;/math&gt;

6.	What is the most money Anne would pay for a gamble which pays $36 with probability 2/3, and $81 with probability 1/3?

* &lt;math&gt;U(gamble) = (2/3) 36^{\frac{1}{2}} + (1/3) 81^{\frac{1}{2}} = (2/3) 6 + (1/3) 9 = 4 + 3 = 7&lt;/math&gt;.
* So the utility of the gamble is 7, but that's not in dollars. A utility of 7 can come from a variety of gambles, or from a sure thing of &lt;math&gt;U(m) = (m)^{\frac{1}{2}} = 7 \Rightarrow m = 7^2 = 49&lt;/math&gt;.
* The gamble is worth $49 to Anne. That's called the '''certainty equivalent''' of the gamble. Since it's worth $49, that's also the most Anne would be willing to pay for the gamble.

Shows a legend row with a colored box.
__TOC__
==Usage==
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;legend|''color''|''label''|outline=''outline color''|border=''css border''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

''color'' is passed to the [[Cascading Style Sheets|css]] background-color property of the color box. The optional ''outline'' parameter is the color of the outline around the box. If you need to customize the border further, you can use the  ''border'' argument, which overrides the ''outline'' argument and sets the css description (e.g. &lt;code&gt;1px solid #aaa&lt;/code&gt;) of the border that will be drawn around the box.

==Examples==
===Use in text===
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{legend|black|Africa}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A single language can comprise several different dialects, which are often dictated by geography. Consider the word aunt. In the Northeast of the United States, the word is often pronounced &quot;ɔnt&quot;; in the South, however, one often hears it pronounced &quot;aint&quot;; in the Midwest, it is pronounced &quot;ant&quot;.

So it was with Ancient Greek. Unlike American English, however, differences in Greek dialects led to differences not only in pronunciation, but in spelling, as well. Thus, in the Attic dialect the word for &quot;sea&quot; is θάλαττα, with a &quot;t&quot; sound. In the Ionic and Doric dialects, however, the word is spelled θάλασσα, with an &quot;s&quot; sound. Sometimes vowel sounds shift between dialects. For example, the Attic word μήτηρ (&quot;mother&quot;) in Doric becomes μάτηρ. Ancient Greek has a number of dialects, chief among them being Attic, Ionic, Doric and Aeolic. Due to its prevalence in ancient Greek literature, Attic Greek is considered the &quot;standard&quot; form of the language, and is the dialect studied in most Greek language textbooks.

Just as in English, the main feature distinguishing Attic from other contemporary dialects is the vowels. Unless it came after an ''ι'', ''ε'', or ''ρ'', what was originally an ''ἄλφα'' usually shifted to an ''ἦτα'' (whence Attic &quot;''μήτηρ''&quot;). Another feature distinguishing Attic was a process called &quot;contraction.&quot; What this means is that when two vowels encounter each other during morphological change they often contract to form one vowel or diphthong in order to be pronounced more easily. The student needn't worry about this much to begin with, but it will become relevant later on. For now, note that Attic was just one of many dialects in a diverse region that would eventually become Greece, and that these features distinguish the way the Athenians spoke.

      <comment>/* THE BASIS OF SALVATION */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">===THE BASIS OF SALVATION===
When Adam sinned by disobeying God in the Garden, he incurred the death penalty for his sin which Yahweh had warned him would be the result if he should disobey (Genesis 2:16). He died on a spiritual level immediately even though he did not die physically. He had actually broken the first commandment to not have any other gods before Yahweh God.  The temptation was put to them, &quot;You shall be as gods&quot;, but in that elevation of themselves above God Himself, they came under the dominion of the god of this world, Satan.

Yahweh wasn't obligated to intervene in any way, but in His great love toward the man He had created, He extended undeserved mercy and favour toward them and brought forth the plan of salvation to redeem them.
He could have left them to the results of their rebellion against Him, but He chose to implement the plan which He had ordained before the foundation of the world, to save them and us, their descendants, through the sacrifice of His own Son on our behalf (Hebrews 4:3; 1 Peter 1:20).

By initiating this act of supreme self-sacrificial love, He was providing a practical demonstration of their dependency upon Him and the fallacy of the deception they had embraced, that they could be self-determined and self-sufficient &quot;as god&quot;. It also taught them the extreme cost of their rebellion, that another life had to be used as a substitute, to pay the penalty for their sin.

They were given the promise of the Messiah, and animal sacrifices began as an expression of faith in the atonement which He would provide as the Lamb of God, for their sins (Genesis 3: 15, 21; John 1:29).

===THE MEANING OF GRACE===
The word 'grace' (CHEN in Hebrew, CHARIS in Greek), as it is used in the scriptures, literally means 'favour', to bend or stoop in kindness to another as a superior to an inferior. It has the idea of graciousness in manner or action. When used in reference to God, it is the benevolent action of Him stooping down to us in His kindness to reach us in our need,  and convey upon us a benefit. His grace has been termed 'unmerited favour' but it is more than an attitude of favour or mercy.  His mercy is an expression of His compassion toward us, but His grace is an extension of benevolence translated into action that releases His enabling power into our lives.   

Seeing that we never merit His favour, we are always indebted to Him to extend to us His mercy and bestow upon us His grace whereby we may respond to Him in an acceptable manner. From beginning to end we are dependent upon Him, for life itself, for all sustenance by which we continue to live and have our existence, and most importantly for our spiritual life without which we are but the &quot;living dead&quot;.

===THE MEANS OF SALVATION===
The means of salvation has always been upon the basis of grace through the exercise of man's faith in the promise of God in the redemption through the Messiah &quot;By grace you have been saved&quot;   (Ephesians 2: 5b). 

For those who lived before His advent, it was a faith exercised in that which was to come, for those who have lived afterward, it is a faith exercised looking back at the records of His life and His works.

&quot;By grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves, it is the gift (charis) of God&quot;  (Ephesians 2: 8)

He extended Himself to us to enable us to respond in an acceptable manner through faith toward His provision for us, so that we might be recipients of His salvation. The faith itself was an impartation of His grace, His 'charis' - gift to us. It is all of His grace - His enabling power.  If it was by any merit on our behalf, then there would be room for self-exaltation, but everyone lacks the moral integrity to stand in His presence, for &quot;there is none righteous, no not one&quot;  (Romans 3:10). And so, it is &quot;Not of works, lest anyone should boast&quot; (Ephesians 2: 9)

&quot;Therefore it is of faith that it might be through grace&quot;  (Romans 4:16)
There has never been any other way to be saved!

===THE WAY OF SALVATION===
&quot;Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Y'shua the Messiah, whom God set forth as a propitiation by his blood, through faith, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance God has passed over the sins previously committed, to demonstrate at the present time His righteousness, that He might be the justifier of the one who has faith in Y'shua&quot;   (Romans 3:24-26)

We are justified (made righteous with God), through His forbearance toward us by means of His grace, by which He has made salvation available in Yeshua the Messiah. He has passed over our sins on the basis of us believing in the One whom He sent to redeem us. Paul says that through Yeshua, God is reconciling the world to himself not imputing their sins (violation of His law) to them (2 Corinthians 5:19).  This reconciliation covers all our past sins which we have confessed, repented of and turned away from (Psalm 32:5; Proverbs 28:13; 1 John 1:9). 

The plan of salvation accorded with His own righteousness and holiness, and yet made provision for man to be reconciled and restored to righteousness in His sight.  It is the process by which sinful humans beings are made acceptable to a holy God. The word justify means &quot;to show to be just, right; to free from blame or guilt&quot;.

In the process of our justification, He charges our sins to Yeshua, our Savior and Redeemer (2 Corinthians 5:21). Justification is based on the righteous, Torah-obedient life of Yeshua and is a free gift to men which results in eternal life (Romans 3:21-22). With the extension of His grace, it is then man's responsibility to act upon His provision in believing faith and receive it as a free gift.  

&quot;Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord, Y'shua the Messiah,   through whom also we have access into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.&quot; (Romans 5: 1, 2, 21)

We now have peace restored to our relationship with God,where there was previously enmity because of our sins, and it is all based on the unmerited grace which He extended toward us.  Justification saves us from the wrath of God (Romans 5:9) against sin which is the violation of His Law/Torah (1 John 3:4).

The purpose of His grace is not just to save us from wrath and damnation, but to fulfil His original purpose which He had in creating us in His image and likeness. That original purpose was to have sons who had proven themselves faithful under testing, come to a maturity of character in which He could share as co-heirs, the responsibilities of administering His creation (Galatians 4:4-5; Romans 8:14, 17, 19, 29). 

Grace is God meeting man where he is, in order to bring man to where He is. It is the active demonstration of the unconditional love of God,  but it does not meet us where we are to just leave us in that condition and merely overlook our deficiencies and shortcomings. God meets us where we are, in our sin and our weakness, and our immaturity, in order to transform us and conform us to His image and stature (Romans 8:29-30). So, although Yahweh is long-suffering and patient with us in the extension of His grace toward us, there is an ultimate expectation in the ministry of His grace toward us for the fulfillment of our ultimate restoration.

This grace in which we now stand, enables us to live the Torah-obedient lifestyle of Yeshua who is our example to follow (1 Corinthians 4:14-16; 1 Thessalonians 1:6; 1 Peter 2:21). He empowers us to obey Him so that we are able to fulfil His eternal purposes for us, through the indwelling presence of his Holy Spirit.

It is possible to abuse the grace of God by continuing to live according to our own desires and our own will.

But, as Paul said, &quot;Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?&quot;  (Romans 6:1). The manifestation of God's Presence in our lives at any time is not a validation of our present state, of our personality or of our present lifestyle. It is an extension of unmerited grace toward us in the interim, while He suffers-long with us in the process of bearing with us as little children who need to go through the stages of growth to reach maturity, and need the constant re-assurance of parental love in the process. But while He will not withdraw His Presence while we act out our childish ways,  we frustrate the grace of God and become transgressors when we build again the former things, instead of going on to maturity (Galatians 2:18:21; Hebrews 6:1, 4-6)

      <text xml:space="preserve">===GRACE BEFORE THE ATONEMENT===
Yahweh God extending grace to mankind did not begin with the New Covenant. Just as He has always executed judgment upon sin so has He always been Merciful and Gracious in all His dealings with mankind.

The breaking of His law has always incurred a penalty, the retribution for which was outlined in the covenant given through Moses. If His people were obedient, they would inherit the blessings, if they were disobedient they would reap the curses of the broken Law. These are outlined in Deuteronomy chapters 27 and 28.

It was only by the penalty of the Law being abrogated in the Messiah, that the curses of the broken law ceased to have effect for those who are in Him. But, it is only to those who live in the Spirit of Christ that there is no &quot;law&quot; (&quot;against such there is no law&quot;), because Yeshua fulfilled the Law's requirements. (Galatians 5:22-25).

Just as it was His grace that was extended to Adam in providing redemption for him rather than allowing the penalty of the law to have it's full effect in death, so it was also grace that was extended to everyone who has chosen to worship God down to Abraham, who is cited as the father of those who come to faith through grace.

Abraham became a figure-head for a natural seed of physical descendants and also a spiritual seed of those, who like him, made the transition from paganism and enmity with God, to finding grace and acceptance with Him in a relationship of faithful obedience and service.

===THE LAW AT SINAI===
The focal point of Sinai was the giving of the Law of Yahweh God. Through that, the nation had a divinely endorsed standard of His expectations of them, for living in relationship with Him. He had mightily displayed His power in the plagues on Egypt which effectively brought them into faith in Him as the Almighty, the one true God, but all the demonstrations of His power and all the miracles were for a greater purpose than just to deliver them from slavery and bondage so that they could have liberty to worship Him (Exodus 5:1).

Yahweh stated His purpose in  Exodus 6:7,
&quot;I will take you as My own people, and I will be your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians. And I will bring you to the land which I swore with uplifted hand to give to Abraham.&quot;

Apart from the fulfillment of the covenant promise to Abraham and the deliverance of them physically (Genesis 15:18-20), His purpose was to take them as His own and bring them into personal relationship with Himself. 
As He says, &quot;And they shall know that I am Yahweh their God, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them.&quot;  (Exodus 29:46)

That is why when they arrive at Sinai, He presents them with a covenant based upon a spiritual union, saying,
&quot;You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles wings and brought you to Myself. Now therefore, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep my covenant, then you shall be a special treasure unto Me above all people; for the earth is Mine. And you shall be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.&quot;  (Exodus 19:4-6)

This was the covenant to which they agreed, answering, &quot;All that Yahweh has spoken we will do&quot;  (Exodus 19:8)

The Law had not yet been given when they entered into this covenant agreement. It was given after three days preparation when they entered into spiritual union with Him in the manifestation of His Presence to them.

One of the first things He said was, &quot;I am Yahweh your God which brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, you shall have no other gods before Me.&quot;  (Exodus 20:1)

He was to be their God and they would be His people. The rest of the commandments followed on the basis that they were His people, and therefore would obey Him as part of their covenant relationship. It was because they were His people that they would be obligated to obey, not that obeying would give them acceptance with Him. It was a marriage union wherein a 'wife' submits to her 'husband' and obeys his commands (Ephesians 5:22-24)

Later when calling Israel to account, He confirms that to Him it was a marriage relationship (Jeremiah 31:31-32)

Yahweh wanted to dwell with His Bride, and so He gave the specifications for a mutual dwelling place for them saying, &quot;And let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them.&quot;  (Exodus 25:19)

The only way that He, as a holy God, could dwell with His people, was if they also would walk in holiness; and hence the giving of the law so that they would be a &quot;kingdom of priests and a holy nation&quot;  (Exodus 19:6). For the relationship to be sustainable, identification of and separation from sin, was necessary. This was the purpose the law served. Firstly, to establish the righteous standard of God for them to walk in holiness as His people, and as a result, to identify sin; &quot;for sin is the transgression of the Law&quot;  (1 John 3:4; Romans 3:20).  Whenever the nation sinned therefore, Yahweh withdrew Himself from them - such an example was in Exodus 33:3, 7-11.

The giving of the law then, was the by-product of entering into covenant relationship with Yahweh God, not the means of entrance into it. Their salvation and redemption was by faith in the Passover lamb with the blood on their doorposts and all that it symbolized of their separation from the gods of Egypt and their allegiance to Him. Their redemption was through the extension of His grace which became available to them through faith.
They were a redeemed people already when they came to Sinai, and as a redeemed people, they were called to walk in His ways and obey His commandments, just as Yeshua calls us to do in the new covenant  (John 15:9-10)

Obedience is the reciprocal response in a love relationship. Their continued obedience enabled the fulfillment of the promises for their divine destiny which were made to Abraham, their disobedience thwarted it.

===WALKING IN HIS COMMANDMENTS===
The law was not impossible for man to keep, even under the old covenant, according to His Word: 
&quot;For this commandment which I command you today, it is not too mysterious for you, nor is it far off. It is not in heaven, that you shouldest say, Who shall ascend into heaven for us, and bring it to us, that we may hear it, and do it? Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, Who will go over the sea for us and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it? But the word is very near you, in your mouth, and in your heart, that you may do it.&quot;  (Deuteronomy 30: 11-14)

It is this scripture which Paul quotes in the new covenant as the basis of a faith relationship with God through Christ. (Romans 10:5-8). In his quotation he differentiates between the basis of life imparted in the old covenant to that of the new. To do that, he uses the scripture in Leviticus 18: 5  - &quot;You shall therefore keep My statutes and My judgments, which if a man does, he shall live by them: I am Yahweh&quot; (Romans 10:5); as a comparison to the implanted Word in the new covenant through which we are partakers of the divine nature, saying, 
&quot;But the righteousness which is of faith speaks on this wise&quot; ....  &quot;that if you will confess with your mouth the Yeshua as Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation&quot;  (Romans 10:6, 9-10)

The point being, that the Word was spoken into their hearts at Sinai, but they did not have the new nature. Whereas in the new covenant the life and nature of Christ is imparted to us through faith when we believe. In the old, they received an infilling of His life in proportion to how they lived according to His Word. We now have His Word implanted within as well as His Spirit, to empower us to live according to His holy Law.

&quot;See, I have set before you today life and good, and death and evil; In that I command you today to love Yahweh your God, to walk in His ways, and to keep His commandments, His statutes, and His judgments, that you may live and multiply: and Yahweh your God will bless you in the land which you go to possess.&quot;  (Deuteronomy 30:15)

Living in and by His Word always brings life, whereas living contrary to it brings death. Prior to Yeshua's sacrifice, the saints of old were dependent upon the Word for the sustenance of their spiritual lives. Their disobedience to it brought them under the curse which was the penalty for the broken law.
  
His Word is a spiritual regenerative power unto eternal life, transforming that which is natural and that which is mortal into that which is spiritual and immortal (John 6:63; Hebrews 4:12; James 1:18, 22-23; 1 Peter 2:23).

      <text xml:space="preserve">===GRACE IN THE OLD COVENANT===
The covenant which was established at Sinai was built upon the Israelites covenant relationship through the promises made to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.  Yahweh placed a divine call upon Abraham's life and made an unconditional covenant with him and before he had proven himself faithful of any merit (Genesis 12:1-3), he was given the promises of offspring, land and nations, which was entirely by the choice and grace of God.

The Abrahamic covenant therefore, was a covenant based upon grace through faith (Romans 4:1-2,16). His descendants inherited the promises unconditionally also, on the same basis, by faith through grace. Each generation implemented the covenant sign of circumcision by faith, on their sons to set them apart to Yahweh as partakers of His covenant and inheritors of the promises made to Abraham (Genesis 17:9-14).

The covenant at Sinai was not a covenant for salvation. They were a redeemed people who had been restored to faith in Yahweh as their God through all the mighty signs and wonders in Egypt and their redemption and deliverance was secured by the blood of the Passover Lamb before the exodus. The covenant at Sinai was the culmination of the promises in the Abrahamic covenant to establish them in the ways of righteousness so that they could fulfill their calling as a priestly nation to the world (Exodus 19:4-6).

===THE PURPOSE OF THE LAW===
The covenant centered around their calling to be a kingdom of priests to the nations, and not for redemption. The Law was given because they were His people, and as His people they should walk in His ways. 

It was not for the purpose of saving them and their salvation did not depend on them keeping it. How they walked in the Law would make a difference though, to whether they inherited the promised blessings, or not.
The Law is good and was given for their benefit (Romans 7:12), so that He could position them to fulfill all that He purposed for them, and they could inherit the promises He made to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.

Living in the Law brings life, whereas living contrary to the Law brings death  (Deuteronomy 30:11-20). 

Walking in His ways would enable them to inherit the blessings, failure to do so, the curses (Deut. 27 &amp; 28).

Walking in His ways would cause them to be a light to the nations (Deuteronomy 4:5-10); but failure to do so would cause them to lose their inheritance in the land and be scattered among the nations (Deut.4:25-30).

Walking in the Law is life and goodness, failure to do so, death and evil  (Deuteronomy 30:15-18)

Obeying it would cause life to go well for them and impart long life  (Deuteronomy 4:40)

Obeying it would keep them walking in righteousness (Deuteronomy 6:25).
By Keeping His Law, some of the blessings would be:
Yahweh would be merciful to them and in His love He would bless them in every way (Deuteronomy 7:11-14).
He would keep sickness and diseases from them (Deuteronomy 7:15).  
He would give them victory over their enemies (Deuteronomy 6:19).

===THE TESTIMONY OF RIGHTEOUSNESS===
Yahweh did not give them the Law if it was not possible for them to keep it and obtain the blessings from it. 

&quot;For this commandment which I command you this day, is not hidden from you, neither is it far off. It is not in heaven, that you should say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it to us, that we may hear it, and do it? Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it to us, that we may hear it, and do it? But the word is very near you, in your mouth, and in your heart, that you may do it&quot;.

The Word had been spoken into their hearts and they understood it's requirements. It was a matter of hearing it with their heart and doing it. It required them to circumcise their hearts (Deuteronomy 10:15-18).

Although there were many backslidings of the nation as a whole, there were also many righteous people who kept His Law and walked in His Ways. There are a few names which stand out from the pages of scripture.

Although it is not specifically said of them that they kept His Law, the evidence is there in their lives. We could name Joshua, Caleb, Gideon, Barak, Samuel, Hannah, David, Elijah, Mordecai, Jeremiah etc., as those who were among the righteous. Then we also have the specific statements regarding the lives of Elizabeth and Zachariah, that they were, &quot;both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless&quot;  (Luke 1:5-6); and Mirium, who the angel Gabriel addressed as, &quot;Highly favoured one, Yahweh is with you&quot;, and again,  &quot;you have found favour with God&quot;  (Luke 1:28, 30).

Paul's own testimony was that he was blameless in how he walked in the righteousness of the Law (Phil. 3:6).

And these could not have been isolated examples. But although many saints did walk in righteousness, the natural state of man without the indwelling Spirit, was more inclined to pre-dispose man toward sin than to walk in the righteousness of the Law. The Law exposed their sin and they reaped its penalty (Romans 7:7-11).

===THE TESTIMONY OF GRACE===
The expression is made that those in the old covenant were &quot;under the law&quot; and Paul himself uses the expression, but with a different meaning than that often implied by it. Paul used it to mean under legalism.
But the old covenant saints were not under the Law in that sense as it was given to them - that came in later through the Pharisees who brought in bondage by their interpretations of how to apply the Law.

The penalty of the Law had not yet been paid, and so when the people sinned, they did reap the curse of the Law,  however, we see in the instance of the Golden Calf, the operation of grace in re-instating them.
Moses seeks to make atonement for their sin, but before He does he begins to seek the grace and mercy of God for the people, &quot;Now therefore, if I have found grace in Your sight, show me now Your way, that I may know You and that I might find grace in Your sight. And consider that this nation is Your people.&quot;  (Exodus 33:13)

Here we see Moses seeking a deeper revelation of the grace of God, as a mediator on behalf of the nation.

&quot;And he said, I beseech You, shew me Your glory. And He said, I will make all my goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of Yahweh before you; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.&quot;  (Exodus 33:18-19)

Then comes the wonderful revelation of His goodness, &quot;Yahweh, Yahweh God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abounding in goodness and truth, keeping mercy to thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and the children's children to the third and the fourth generation&quot;  (Exodus 34:6-7)

In seeking to come into a greater measure of His glory, he is shown the glory of His grace which tempers all His judgments of man according to His truth: &quot;But let him that glories glory in this, that he understands and knows me, that I am Yahweh which exercise lovingkindness [chesed], judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith Yahweh.&quot;  (Jeremiah 9:24)

The old testament saints experienced His grace in their walk with Him because it is part of His nature and a relationship with Him involves coming to know Him as He is, as they could testify:
&quot;But You, O Lord, are a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, plenteous in mercy [chesed] and truth.&quot;  (Psalm 86:15); and even in judgment they found mercy and grace extended toward them:
&quot;Thus says Yahweh, The people which were left of the sword found grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.&quot;  (Jeremiah 31:2)

&quot;Yahweh is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy [chesed] Yahweh is good to all and His tender mercies [racham -compassions] are over all His works.&quot;  (Psalm 145:8)

&quot;Surely goodness and mercy [chesed] shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of Yahweh for ever.&quot;  (Psalm 23: 6)

      <text xml:space="preserve">===SALVATION BY GRACE===
Salvation is provided through Yeshua the Messiah solely upon the basis of His grace and not upon any attempt of ours by any means whereby we might hope to attain God's standard of righteousness. Man was created in the image and likeness of God (Genesis 1:26) which was according to His own righteousness, and that is the standard of righteousness which He has ordained for man and by which He measures man. Adam's disobedience caused mankind to become a 'fallen' creature who cannot regain that original glory of God in which he was created. 

The scripture says that &quot;all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God&quot; (Romans 3:23)

&quot;As it is written, there is none righteous, no not one;&quot; (Romans 3:10)

&quot;Therefore just as through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all have sinned&quot;   (Romans 5:12)

It is the state of spiritual death into which we are all born that causes us to be unable to attain God's standard of righteousness. All of our good works originate out of our fallen self-nature and are unable to redeem or transform us, nor are we able to bring about a regeneration of spiritual life, to renew our fallen nature. We are spiritually dead and without hope, apart from the mercy and grace of God.

&quot;But God, who is rich in mercy, because of the great love wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved) ... &quot;   

&quot;For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.&quot;   (Ephesians 2:4, 8)

It is His grace that has made it available, it is our faith that makes it our possession.

&quot;Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord, Yeshua the Messiah, through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.&quot;  (Romans 5:1-2)

&quot;For if by the one man's offense death reigned through one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Yeshua the Messiah.&quot;   (Romans 5:17)

All of God's gracious promises to us are accessed through faith. Our standing with Him is based upon His grace and not upon our own efforts.  Therefore to obtain that which He has promised, we must exercise our faith to receive it. It is also only by faith that we receive an impartation of the righteousness of God  -  it is a free gift given to us in Yeshua so that we might reign over sin, and walk in His ways. 

===THE LAW AND RIGHTEOUSNESS===
The Law was set in place to define the standards of God's righteousness for man so that sin could be identified. It exposed sin as sin (Romans 7:7-13), whereas previously, before the Law was given, man was dependent upon the honesty of his own conscience, which isn't reliable as an unbiased judge upon one's own actions. So, with the giving of the Law, clear identification was given to things which had not been addressed previously.

&quot;For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.&quot; (Romans 5:13) 

Sin was in the world before the Law was given but the Law was added to impute sin, not to save us. &quot;But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God is evident: for, the righteous shall live by faith&quot;  (Galatians 3:11)

&quot;Know that whatever the Law says, it says to those who are under the law [lit. in the law], that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. Therefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight, for by the law is the knowledge of sin.&quot;   (Rom. 3:19-20)

&quot;Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us&quot;  (Titus 3:5)

The scripture is clear that by the &quot;deeds of the law&quot;, our &quot;works of righteousness&quot; or obeying the Law, no one is justified or made righteous with God. The Law leads us to acknowledge our sin and seek His mercy and grace. Then, by faith in the Sacrifice He has provided, we can be cleansed from our sin.

&quot;Is the Law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! for if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness would have been by the law.&quot;  (Galatians 3:21). But the Law was never intended to do that. The Law was given because of their transgressions and to instruct them in righteousness; as a pattern for righteous living of what Yahweh expected of them, not as a means of salvation, but as a way for a people in covenant relationship with Him to live, and how Abraham himself lived before the Law was given (Genesis 26:5)

Obeying the commandments in one's own efforts, will not make one righteous because the Law in itself is unable to impart life, but being made righteous through faith in Yeshua's atonement for sin, and receiving an impartation of His life, will enable one to be able to walk in obedience to the commandments of the Law.

===THE PENALTY OF THE LAW===
Adam brought sin upon his descendants and through sin, the death penalty upon all mankind. Salvation for mankind therefore, could only be through paying the death penalty for sin. The Grace of God required that a substitute for man be found and so animal sacrifices were given as a means for sinful man to release his faith in the promised atonement for sin until the One came who would be the perfect and complete Sacrifice for sin.

The penalty of death reigned before the Law was given, even though there was no identification of it (Romans 5:12-14) and death continues to reign over all who are outside of Christ - they are still under the penalty of the Law. His death was to atone for all from the time of Adam who did not have the Law, as well as those who were given the Law. The Law increased the accountability of those who received it to seek salvation and forgiveness for sins committed, rather than it excluded those before it was given of any accountability.

&quot;But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth His Son born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons&quot;.  (Galatians 4:4) 

Because He was born into Adam's race, He also was born &quot;under the law&quot; so that He could redeem those who were &quot;under the law&quot;. This terminology has been taken to mean those under the Mosaic covenant, to whom the Law was given.  But Paul is speaking to Gentile believers here as &quot;we&quot;, being the ones who were born &quot;under the law&quot;, that is, under the penalty of the Law. He is not speaking to Jewish believers as being &quot;under the law&quot;. If he were meaning under the law-system, the Mosaic covenant, then redemption would only be available to those under that system - they would be the only ones &quot;under the law&quot;, that Yeshua came to redeem. It would then even exclude all the patriarchs who were not &quot;under the law&quot;. But that is not what Paul is saying here.

The term being &quot;under the law&quot; means all who were born under the death penalty of the Law, from Adam to Christ, because all outside of Christ are under its penalty, and He came to redeem all mankind.

&quot;Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us&quot;  (Galatians 3:13)

The Law itself is not a curse but the curse results from breaking the Law. The curse of the Law is the outworking of the death penalty as a result of sin. &quot;For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse&quot;...... because man is unable to keep the Law perfectly, without defection  (Galatians 3:10-12; Hebrews 7:19).

Yeshua took that upon Himself to release us from the curse of the Law in it's penalty upon us.

Therefore those who desire to be justified by the &quot;works of the law&quot; after they have been saved by grace, put themselves back &quot;under the law&quot;. In other words, by attempting to be righteous by keeping the Law, they put themselves back under the penalty of the law which they will incur for not keeping the Law perfectly. By so doing, they negate the work of grace in their lives, no longer being &quot;under grace&quot;, but &quot;under law&quot;. 

As Paul said, &quot;he is a debtor to keep the whole law, you have become estranged from Christ, you who attempt to be justified by the law, you have fallen from grace.&quot;  (Galatians 5:3b-4)

Grace delivers the believer from the jurisdiction of the law, works bring one under the power of it's curse.

But being not &quot;under law&quot; but &quot;under grace&quot;, does not exempt one from the standards of God's holy Law.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===THE CHOICE FACTOR===
&quot;But where sin abounded, grace abounded much more, so that as sin reigned unto death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Yeshua the Messiah our Lord&quot;  (Romans 5:20b-21)

Whereas we were under the dominion of sin which brought the penalty of the Law upon us, we are now under the dominion, or rather, the jurisdiction of grace through righteousness leading to, or resulting in, eternal life.
His grace rules our life through righteousness where sin ruled our life leading to and resulting in eternal death. Righteousness is the key factor to inheriting eternal life, just as sin was what led to reaping eternal death.

Grace is measured out in a super-abundance in comparison to the judgment merited by the law and cancels out the penalty of sin, but not without some qualification. We were slaves to sin as our master. We did not have the equity to redeem ourselves as free men from that slavery, we have been bought by the hand of a Redeemer and so we are not our own. We have been bought with a price, even that of the precious blood of our Saviour, who is now our Master, and whom we serve by submitting to the power of His life in righteousness. His grace is an enabling power to righteous living and not a winking at, overlooking, passing over or condoning of our sins.

&quot;What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace?  Certainly not! Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves slaves to obey, you are that one's slaves whom you obey, whether of sin leading to death, or of obedience leading to righteousness?   (Romans 6:15-16)

&quot;For sin shall not have dominion over you for you are not under law but under grace&quot;  (Rom.6:14)

Because we still have free-will, we still have a choice as to what we will obey, the life of Christ or the self-life. Delivered from the power of the law through sin, we come under what we yield to, the old nature or the new.

&quot;But now having been set free from sin, you became slaves of righteousness&quot;  (Romans 6:18)
Being &quot;under grace&quot; is being a &quot;slave&quot; to righteousness!

&quot;For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes&quot;  (Romans 10:4)

&quot;Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is freed from sin.  (Romans 6:6-7)

&quot;For sin shall not have dominion over you for you are not under law but under grace&quot;   (Romans 6:14)

The action of the Law was put out of operation through the crucifixion of Christ and our identification with Him in His death, so that we should not longer serve sin as our master. We are now under the power of His grace which has its outworking in the fruit of righteous, holy living  (Romans 6:21-22)

===UNDER LAW OR UNDER GRACE===
What is the qualifying factors to distinguish those living &quot;under law&quot; to those living &quot;under grace&quot;?

If the fruit of being &quot;under grace&quot; is righteousness (as identified in Romans 6:21-22), then someone walking in His grace will be walking in His righteousness. And how do we identify what is righteousness?

That is one of the purposes for which the Law was given, to set a standard of righteousness for mankind.

&quot;For all the Law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: 'you shall love your neighbour as yourself'&quot;  (Galatians 5:14)

&quot;I say then, walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh&quot;  (Galatians 5:16)

It is the lusts of the fallen sinful nature which cause us to sin (James 4:1-5), which are outlined in Galatians 5:19-21 which take us out from under the jurisdiction of His grace and cause us to forfeit our inheritance.

But if we fall back again into the works of the old nature then the Law will become operative in our life.

&quot;But if you are led of the Spirit, you are not under the law&quot;  (Galatians 5:18) -  because when you live out of the new nature you will not fulfill the lusts of the flesh which brings you under the law's penalty for sin.
But if you do go back into sin, walking carnally or living unrighteously, then you come back &quot;under the law&quot;.

A person is NOT under the law while he is walking in the Spirit of Christ.  &quot;Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, [etc.]&quot; (I Timothy 1:9)

To use a worldly example: If we disobey the law of the land, we shall come under the penalty of the law, whereas if we obey the laws, there is no law enforcement needed upon us. While we live within its boundaries, we cannot be judged by the law and there will be no charges against us. If we have no desire to break the law, then the fact that we are keeping the law may not even come to mind, because we do those things in the law out of our own natural inclination to do so. 

So, it is if we walk in the Spirit of Christ. His grace will dominate our lives and we will abide in Him and manifest the fruit of His Spirit as branches of the Vine by nature bear the same fruit as the parent vine. 
The branch can only bear the fruit of the Vine while the sap of the Vine is flowing through it  (John 15:4).

&quot;As the Father has loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love. If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love.&quot;  (John 15:9-10)

===LAW ESTABLISHED THROUGH GRACE===
The Law itself has not been done away with, or put out of action, by the introduction of grace to overrule the penalty of the Law against us. The Law still fulfills its purpose of setting the standard of righteousness and convicting of sin. Also, through His grace, by faith, the Law is established in our lives (Romans 3:31). 

Yeshua Himself made very positive statements against the idea of the Law being done away with by His Coming to fulfill the law and the prophets (Matthew 5:17-18).  Also He said, &quot;Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does and  teaches them, shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.&quot;  (Matthew 5:19)

These commandments are the ones which He Himself kept and which He has taken to a new depth of application in the new covenant. The Father's commandments are now His commandments delivered to us for the new covenant man (John 15:9-10).  The quality of love to which He now calls us, in our love for Him and the Father, as well as in our love for our neighbour, has been taken to the level of divine love (John 13:34-35). 

The apostles and teachers recognised the need of the Law to teach and instruct, to exhort and encourage and to correct error (2 Timothy 3:16). The Law given at Sinai was the basis upon which they established the new covenant community, both in its structure and in its teachings through the guidance of the Holy Spirit. 

James likens the Law to a mirror, into which when one peers into it, they will see their own image reflected back to them, so they can determine what manner of 'man' they are - natural or spiritual (James 1:22-25). 
For, by the Law is the knowledge of sin and the revelation of Yeshua (Romans 3:20; 2 Corinthians 3:18)

There are some instances in Pauls' letters where he is addressing legalism which came in as a result of Jewish brethren desiring to bring the believers under the letter of the Law in their observance of the traditions which he had delivered to them. One of the main issues was the so-called need to be circumcised in order to be saved. This occasioned a strong defense against legalistic observances. 

However, it is not legalism to live in the Law of God. There is a difference between living under legalism and living in the Law of our heavenly Father. One is motivated by fleshly commandments, the other originates from an obedient heart's response to His commands.

Legalism is born out of slavish fear but obedience to His Law, is born out of love.

&quot;For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments.&quot;  (John 5:3)

      <text xml:space="preserve">===THE LAST DAY OF SUKKOT  -- HOSHANNAH RABBAH===

The seventh day of the Feast of  Sukkot is called &quot;Hoshanah Rabbah,&quot; meaning &quot;the many hoshanahs.&quot;   
This is a contraction of hoshiah na --  'the Great Hoshana,'  or &quot;The Great Salvation&quot;  which comes from the closing words of Psalm 118:25, 26 “Save now (hoshiah na), I beseech You, O Yahweh... ”    

This day was the last day of the seven-day festival and was concluded with a special ceremony in the night to conclude the festivities which symbolised the prophetic significance of the end of the feast of Sukkot proper. 
 
&quot;Speak to the children of Israel, saying: The fifteenth day of this seventh month (Tishrei) shall be the feast of Tabernacles for seven days to Yahweh.  On the first day there shall be a holy convocation.  You shall do no customary work on it.&quot;  (Leviticus 23:33-35)

The festivities of the seventh and final day actually went over into the night, which according to Biblical reckoning, was then the eighth day.  The eighth day (called Shemini Atzeret) was a holy convocation as was the first day of Sukkot and was added to the Sukkot  festival period, but this was a separate appointment with Yahweh God, with its own spiritual and prophetic significance.   Leviticus 23:36

===THE PROPHETIC TEMPLE RITUAL===
On this last (7th) day, at about 3 o’clock in the afternoon, the High Priest would lead a procession off the Temple Mount and through the streets of Jerusalem down to the Pool of Siloam to fill the golden pitcher which he carried, with the  Living Water (Mayim Chaim) from the pool.  As on the other days of the feast, he led the procession back to the Temple.  There he is handed a silver pitcher full of wine and he pours the water and the wine out together and he prays on this day for two things. First, for the rains, the former and the latter rains for the natural harvest. Then he prays “God in heaven, send Your Messiah soon and in our days. We cry out for our our Messiah now&quot;  (Psalm 118:25-26)

As part of this Feast which is also called the feast of Ingathering, palm branches, myrtle branches, and willow branches are collected and held in the right hand (Leviticus [Vayikra] 23:40). A fourth entity, the etrog, representing the Gentiles or non-Jewish believers, is also gathered. These four species are used in a ceremony for Sukkot to represent the ingathering of the nations into His barn.

Every other day of the Feast of Sukkot, the priestly procession would march around the altar one time, holding and waving the four species of lulav branches and shouting praises to Yahweh God.   But on the seventh day, this circling procession was done seven times while singing with a loud voice the song of redemption and salvation in the Hoshanna prayers.   At this time the people also waved their palm branches while the Levites chanted the Hallel (Psalms 113-118).   

At the conclusion of the seventh circle, they took the willows which had been placed at the altar as part of the temple ritual for the day (Sukkah 45a), and struck the willows branches onto the ground around the altar, in the process separating the leaves from the branches to symbolize the casting away of the nation’s sins. 

The broken willow leaves are symbolic of man's sins that are cast off on what was considered to be the last and final day of judgment when the decision on high, sealed on the Day of Atonement, was confirmed.

&quot;On the final day, the entire congregation marches around seven times, carrying even more willow leaves with them. These seven times, a memorial of the circuits made by the ancient priests around the Temple altar during worship, remind us of God's goodness in destroying Jericho once Israel had circled it seven times.

&quot;In contrast to the festive days of Sukkot, Hoshana Rabbah is observed solemnly, as an extension of the Day of Atonement. On this day, the rabbis tell us, the GATES OF JUDGMENT FINALLY CLOSE and the decrees pronounced by God on the Day of Atonement take effect&quot; (The Fall Feasts of Israel, p.198-199).

This is symbolic typology drawn from an actual harvest.  When the harvest is brought in, it is laid on the threshing floor to dry out.  Then it is beaten and winnowed to remove the grain from the chaff.   This is when the grain is gathered and the chaff is blown away or consumed in a fire.  The beating symbolises the judgment process to harvest the grain. 

The place of the temple altar was originally the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite which David purchased in order to have a place of sacrifice to remove the curse off Israel.  (1 Chronicles 21:13-25)   When David brought the ark back to Jerusalem it was placed in the city of David (1 Chronicles 16: 1)  and afterward, when Solomon reigned, he brought up the ark and placed it in the temple which he built upon Mount Moriah, over that threshing floor.  (2 Chronicles 3: 1; 5: 2-7)

The beating of the willow branches was a prophetic act of the winnowing of the harvest on the threshing floor. This all pictures the judgment process which He will initiate when the harvest of the earth is reaped (Revelation14:14-16). During this, He will separate the chaff from the wheat and burn the chaff with unquenchable fire (the lake of fire) in the Great White Throne judgment. (Matthew 3:11-12; Revelation 20:11-15)

Each night of the Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkot) there was a great ceremony called the &quot;Illumination of the Temple,&quot; which involved the ritual lighting of four golden oil-fed lamps in the Court of Women. These lamps were huge menorahs/candelabras (seventy-five feet high) lighted in the Temple at night to remind the people of the pillar of fire that had guided them in their wilderness journey. All night long they shone in their brilliance, illuminating the entire city.  

In celebration and anticipation of the return of the Shekinah glory to Israel, the holiest of Israel's men danced and sang psalms of joy and praise, before Yahweh God. This festival was a reminder that He had promised to send His Light, to a sin-darkened world.  Yahweh God promised to send the Messiah to renew Israel's glory, release them from bondage, and restore their joy.  This is the  background for the impact of the words said by Y'shua in the Temple courtyard when he announced, &quot;I am the Light of the world.&quot;   John 8:12

He is the Light, the source of illumination, to bring the lost out of darkness.  He had come up to Jerusalem for the feast and went into the Temple,  to teach the people and illumine their hearts. (John 7: 1-9; 14-30).  

Y'shua made His declaration that it was also through Him that the people would receive the living water which was typified in the feast,  &quot; On that last day, that great day of the feast, Y'shua stood up and cried out, saying,'If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.   He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.' But this He spoke concerning the Spirit, whom those believing in Him would receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified&quot;   John 7:37-39

During the time of Y'shua, the high point of the Sukkot celebration was the &quot;drawing of  water&quot; (Simchat Bais HaShoava) ceremony.   This expressed the messianic hope of the people at that time who in their oppression by their Roman overseers, and their understanding of the prophecies,  were looking for the advent of their Messiah.   So when Y'shua appeared on the scene,  with the themes of light and water on their minds, they were ready to identify Him as the &quot;Son of David&quot; and hope for deliverance by Him from their oppressors.  (John 7:14-30; 37-38; 8:12)

In His proclamations to the people He was appealing to their need for the true light which lightens every man and the real water of life which satisfies the thirsty soul.   He combined two of the messianic symbols of the feast - the water libation and the light of the candlelabras in the Temple precinct, to illustrate the fulfillment in Himself of the promised restoration of Israel under Messiah in the age to come. 

===THE FULFILLMENT OF HOSHANNA RABBAH===
This final celebration of the harvest, pictures the final stage of God's plan of salvation.  The &quot;last great day of the feast&quot; is the Last Great Day of the second resurrection and the &quot;Great White Throne Judgment&quot;.

All those who did not qualify to be part of the first resurrection will rise up, to human life, after the 1,000 year period (Revelation 20:5-6) of the Millennium .   They will be judged at that time -- the time  of the &quot;Great Salvation,&quot; or &quot;Many Hoshannas.&quot;   This judgment will be the sealing of those who are raised, some to eternal life and others to everlasting destruction (Revelation 20:11-15).  It will be the separation of the wheat and the chaff and the end of sin on the earth.

Then the glory of God will illumine His city  and the pure water of the river of life will flow from the throne of God and of the Lamb and the trees which grow by it shall be for the salvation of the nations.  (Revelation 21:22-24; 22: 1-4)

      <text xml:space="preserve">===SHEMINI ATZERET===

Shemini Atzeret is an eighth day extension of the seven day Sukkot season and concludes it, and yet it is a separate festival with its own significance, although connected to it. It is held on the twenty-second day of Tishrei.

Yahweh God gave His instructions regarding this day  -
&quot;. . . on the eighth day you shall have a holy convocation; and you shall offer an offering made by fire unto Yahweh:  it is a sacred assembly; and you shall do no customary work on it&quot;  Leviticus 23:36

And again in Numbers 29:35-36
&quot;. . .  On the eighth day you shall have a sacred assembly.    You shall do no customary work.    You shall present a burnt offering , an offering made by fire as a sweet aroma to Yahweh ...  ...  &quot;

In Deuteronomy 16:14-17 we are told,
&quot;&quot;Be joyful at our Feast-- you, your sons and daughters, your menservants and maidservants, and the Levites, the aliens, the fatherless and the widows who live in your towns.  For seven days celebrate the Feast to Yahweh at the place which Yahweh will choose. For Yahweh will bless you in all your harvest and in all the work of your hands, and your joy will be complete. Three times a year all your men must appear before Yahweh at the place he will choose: at the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks and the Feast of Tabernacles. No man should appear before Yahweh empty-handed: Each of you must bring a gift in proportion to the way Yahweh has blessed you&quot;   

“Shemini” means eighth, while “Atzeret” means conclusion or gathering.   It comes from the Hebrew root “atzar” meaning “to hold back” or to “tarry”.   In that connotation it is seen as an added day to spend with Yahweh which brings the feast to a conclusion but also it also prepares for the beginning of a new cycle. 
 
===HISTORICAL OBSERVATION OF THE FEAST===
In Hebraic tradition  Shemini Atzeret was a closure on the festivities of Sukkot and a new beginning.    The people came out of their sukkahs and returned to their own dwellings, but not back to their normal routines.
The people had gone from the days of awe and repentance in The Feast of Trumpets and Atonement, into a festival of joy in Tabernacles and the eighth day is decreed as a memento of all that has been gained throughout the period, so that its collective benefits could be savoured and enjoyed in one more day of intimacy with Yahweh.  The Rabbis understood that in a special sense, this day was to consolidate all the knowledge, spiritual food, and instruction that had been gained in the preceding holy days for spiritual growth and maturity.  They recognized that this day, in itself, was a very special holy day and saw it as distinct from the Feast of Sukkot or Tabernacles.  

This day was also a transition into the new season about to commence, and a consideration of the needed rain for the earth to bring forth a new harvest in the land.  One of the features of the day was the special prayer for rain for the produce of the coming season which was not done previously, as they were still living in their 'sukkot'.
 
On this eighth and final Day there was a gathering of all the women of Israel in the Court of the Women. They sang songs of rejoicing and praise, they danced before Yahweh waving banners and flags and torches.  Then, they proceeded from the Temple Mount into the streets of Jerusalem.  As they danced through the streets, the city came alive with rejoicing and with the light of the flames as the procession passed by.  When they returned to the Temple Mount, in the Court of the Women,  a Menorah was erected there.  This menorah was 80 feet tall and had at each of the seven places,  a bath of 30 gallons of fine oil.  The torches were given to the husbands of the dancers to light the Menorah.  When the Menorah was lit, the entire city of Jerusalem was awash in its glow.  

Because the city sits within the bowl of the hills which surround it, and because this Menorah was so high and so bright, every corner of every home in the city was alight with its radiance. The rabbis say that to see Jerusalem in those days was to experience the Radiant Glory of God that has been lost since the Shekinah left the first Temple. They called this the “Light of Jerusalem.”  So it was in this glorious setting that Y'shua proclaimed Himself as &quot;the Light of the World&quot;  (John 8:12). 

He was the prophetic fulfillment of light and glory which is to fill the earth with its radiance.  (Numbers 14:21) 

===SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FEAST===
There are no rituals or symbols connected with Shemini Atzeret, unlike the other feasts.  It is an 'aliyah' (going up to a higher level) from the physical and material to the purely spiritual and intangible -- from that which can be seen to that which cannot be seen, from that which is temporal to that which is eternal.  (2 Corinthians 1:18). 

All the previous rituals and festivities had their purpose, but now that that it is all completed, it is time to be centred in Him alone and enjoy His presence without any of the facilitating means and methods of attaining that fellowship.

The picture of Shemini Atzeret is that of a very intimate union and fellowship, which follows after the broad-based and universal Feast of Sukkot whose focus is on the harvest and ingathering of the nations.   It is a close family union, with greater depth of meaning and spirituality.  &quot;Rabbi Noach of Lechowitz expounded, The theme of Shemini Atzeret may be better  understood if we think of it in terms of a BRIDE AND GROOM.  During the wedding, they are both decked out in a wardrobe of exquisite, elegant clothes and jewelry.  However,  when they come together in their private chamber, they remove their garments and jewelry. &quot;It is the same with Shemini Atzeret.  During the seven days of Sukkot, the Jewish people offered a profusion of seventy bulls, but on Shemini Atzeret -- the moment they achieve COMPLETE UNIFICATION WITH GOD -- they brought only one bull (Numbers 29:36)&quot; (The Essence of the Holy Days, p.98-99).

Comparing the symbolism of this Holy Day with the imagery of a Bride and Bridegroom, and their intimate togetherness, by themselves, after all the guests and party-goers depart, gives us a special insight into the real spiritual implications of Shemini Atzeret.  The picture reveals that after the Millennial &quot;Feast&quot; of Sukkot is finished, and the great &quot;Fall Harvest&quot; has been gathered in,  the Bride -- the Assembly of Yahweh - His Body of spiritual sons, the true Israelites (Galatians 6:16) -- and the Groom, Y'shua the Messiah -- will have a special &quot;day&quot; or time to themselves, in an even deeper expression of intimate love, sensitivity, and pure joy. It is symbolic of the consummation of the union between the Bride and her Bridegroom in the Marriage Supper of the Lamb.

&quot;Alleluia! For Yahweh, God Omnipotent reigns!   Let us be glad and rejoice and give Him glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready&quot;    Revelation 19: 6b, 7.

The King has been crowned and has ascended His throne and His pure and spotless, virgin Bride is seated beside Him to reign for all eternity.    This marks the commencement of the new heavens and the new earth wherein dwells righteousness.	

&quot;And I John saw the holy city, New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband&quot;   Revelation 21: 2   Also  Revelation 19:11-12, 16; 20:11; 21:1-2;  2 Peter 3:13

===THE NEW HEAVEN AND THE NEW EARTH===
There is great significance in the number &quot;eight&quot; in the name of the feast. Numerically the number eight, as the eighth day, is symbolic of perfect completion, and yet the first of a new series,  although it is the eighth.

Even as &quot;seven&quot; is God's number of perfection, or completion (as the Sabbath is the seventh day of the week, which completes and perfects the week), so &quot;eight&quot; is an extension of that completion which adds to it as well as being the first day of the next week, counting from the days of the previous week.  Thus it represents &quot;A NEW BEGINNING.&quot; 

&quot;Shemini Atzeret&quot; is the new beginning of the next phase of Yahweh God's Plan   Its very name identifies it as a &quot;new beginning.&quot;  

&quot; . . .  And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I MAKE ALL THINGS NEW&quot; (Revelation 21: 5).

Isaiah the prophet also unveils this incredible scene of the new heavens and the new earth.  He prophesied, in chapter 65, of God creating the new heavens and earth, as something to be rejoiced in for all eternity.  
 
&quot;For, behold, I create NEW HEAVENS AND A NEW EARTH:  and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.  But be ye GLAD and REJOICE FOREVER  in that which I CREATE:  for, behold, I create JERUSALEM A REJOICING, and her people a joy&quot;  Isaiah 65:17-18
 
The harvest has been reaped. All sin, iniquity and transgression are finished, having been dealt with at the final resurrection and judgment.   Everlasting righteousness is ushered in and the former things are not to be even remembered again. There has been a completion of one cycle, and the beginning of another NEW cycle, according to the Father's Plan. 
  
As the prayers for rain in Shemini Atzeret indicate, there is another season of planting and harvest, but this time it is in righteousness, producing according to the Father's plan &quot;after our own kind&quot;.   This &quot;new beginning&quot; requires &quot;rain&quot; -- a type of the Spirit of God poured out in order to produce a new crop and a new harvest. Spiritually, then, it represents the pouring out anew of the living water and the continuation and expectation of a new harvest  for the Kingdom.   Isaiah 55:10-13

This is the pure river of water flowing out from the throne of God and of the Lamb (Revelation 22: 1)

&quot;And the Spirit and the Bride say, &quot;Come!&quot;  And let him who hears say, &quot;Come!&quot;  And let him who thirsts come.
Whoever desires, let him take of the water of life freely.&quot; Revelation 22:17

When He created Adam it was with the purpose of him having dominion over the earth.   Now with many sons having come into His glory who will rule and reign over His creation, the Father can fulfill His original intention.
As Paul said,  &quot;As it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him&quot;   I Corinthians 2: 9. 

What new vistas or horizons lay beyond in the ages to come?    Paul said,  &quot;For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the GLORY that shall be revealed in us&quot;    Romans 8:18. 
  
This is a level of glory that is beyond our perception - to actually be included as one and in perfect union with the Godhead, and to have the same glory.  That is the prayer that Y'shua prayed, and it will be fulfilled!   John 17:22-24

As Paul wrote to the Church in Rome, &quot;The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we ARE the children of God. And if children, then HEIRS; heirs of GOD, and JOINT-HEIRS with CHRIST:  if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also GLORIFIED TOGETHER&quot; (Romans 8:16-17).  

Those who attain that resurrection will live in an earth restored to its Eden-like conditions over which they will have dominion and fulfill Yahweh God original mandate of being sons of the Most High God.
And they will reign for ever and ever  --  going onward and forward to receive all that He has purposed to those who love Him  --  for ALL ETERNITY, the &quot;olam haba&quot; - &quot;to the vanishing point,&quot; that, is, throughout &quot;all ages&quot;.
  
===SIMCHA TORAH===
Simchat Torah means &quot;rejoicing in the Torah.&quot;  Simchat Torah is observed in conjunction with Shemini Atzeret and is part of the celebration of the anticipated world to come, the &quot;Olam Haba&quot; - the new heavens and the new earth.  

The cycle of Torah reading ends on this day in Deuteronomy and a new one commences in Genesis as part of this never-ending cycle of reading, studying and meditating on the Word of God.   As soon as the last verse is finished, the cycle starts again at the beginning, without a break.  The Torah is read in a continuous cycle because the circle is a symbol of eternity.  It goes on forever.  It is eternal, just as the One who gave us the Torah is Eternal.  

Thus a never-ending cycle of feasting on His Word.

Simcha Torah then,  represents rejoicing in the eternal Word - the Torah, which is an expression of the Living Torah, Y'shua.  The water of His Word will flow for all eternity as a river from the throne of God.

There is no scriptural reference to this celebration but it became instituted when the Israelites returned from the captivity in Babylon and continued through the second Temple period as part of the festivities of Shemini Atzeret.

In the ninth century of our common era, the rabbis decreed to make it a separate day, a ninth day, attached to Shemini Atzeret and allocated solely to the celebration surrounding the Torah.  This resulted from the importance that was given to Torah reading as a result of the destruction of the Temple.   Studying the Word became an alternative and a substitute for the rituals, spiritual life and practices that surrounded the Temple.

A great celebration has been made of rewinding the scrolls of the law from the end of Deuteronomy back to Genesis. Torah scrolls are then carried in a circle and danced seven times around the sanctuary in a joyous parade called “hakafot”.   This is to signify the ending of the cycle of Torah reading for the year and the beginning of a new cycle for the coming year.  Candles are then put into the ark in place where the scrolls were, as a reminder that God’s law is our light. Psalm 119:105

Y'shua reminded us when He was at the Temple on Sukkot that He was the living Word  -
&quot;I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.&quot; John 8:12

&quot;The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. &quot;  John 1:14 

&quot;Rejoice in the Lord always, again I say, rejoice.&quot;   Philippians 4: 4


It is a command to be joyful on these days, so that will require us not to think or talk about anything negative, but instead be joyful in our thoughts and deeds and encourage others in our midst to do the same.

&quot;Who is like unto You Yahweh among the mighty ones, glorious in holiness, awesome in praises, doing wonders, blessed are You, Yahweh&quot;  (Exodus 15:11)  

&quot;For Yahweh is the great God, and the great King above all gods.&quot;  (Psalm 95: 3)

&quot;Great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in His holy mountain.&quot;  (Psalm 48: 2)

&quot;God has gone up with a shout, Yahweh with the sound of the shofar.  Sing praises to God, sing praises!  Sing praises to our King, sing praises!  For God is king over all the earth; Sing praises with understanding.  (Psalm 47:5-7)

&quot;And all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Yahweh with shouting and with the sound of the shofar&quot;  (2 Samuel 6:15)

A processional circuit of the altar seven times while scripture is read  --
Psalm 147:19-20; Psalm 148:13-14; Psalm 149: 1-4; Psalm 150 


In the synagogue when the Ark is opened and all the scrolls have been taken out, everybody in the synagogue is given an opportunity to dance with them.  Each dance begins with a circuit of the bimah (the central platform in the synagogue from which the Torah is read), which symbolises the altar in the Temple.  This is done seven times to the singing of various Hebrew melodies.  This joyous parade is called the “hakafot” and everyone is given an opportunity to take part in it.

COMMUNAL DANCING
The endless circle of dancing symbolises the eternity of Torah and its Author, who has also given us an inheritance in his eternal kingdom. In this we rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.

&quot;Arise O Yahweh to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your strength.  Your priests will be clothed in righteousness, Your saints will shout aloud for joy.&quot;  (Psalm 132: 9)  [read when scroll is returned]

Yom tov Ve'al yom Shmini Atseret hachag hazeh.    
Have a blessed day for this day of Shemini Atzeret 


The traditional original type of Torah scrolls are kept in an &quot;Ark&quot; and are removed from them for each participant to dance with them, or for the leader to lead a procession of dancing.  They are returned to the Ark when the celebration is finished.
 
In traditional settings, all kohanim and leviim--priests and Levites--are honored first, followed by the congregation. Each procession is done to the chanting of prescribed hymns. To these are added songs and hymns of a joyous nature.

It is also customary to hand out flags for children to carry, supposedly reminiscent of the tribal flags under which the Israelites marched in the desert.

Blessing:  Ba-ruch a-ta Yahweh, El-o-hay-nu me-lech ha-o-lam, a-sher ba-char ba-noo; mee-kol ha-a-meem, Ve-na-tan la-nu et 	To-ra-to. Ba-ruch a-ta Yahweh, no-tain ha-Torah.
Blessed are You Yahweh, our Elohim, King of the universe, Who has chosen us from all peoples, and has given us His Torah. Blessed are You Yahweh, the Giver of the Torah.

Readings:  John 7:37-39;  Isaiah 44: 3--4;  Revelation 22: 1-5

5.  SIMCHAT BEIT HASHOEVAH  -  Celebration of Water Pouring
This may be done as a symbolic act as the water-pouring ceremony at the altar in the temple or as a water libation.

In the temple era, the High Priest led a procession off the Temple Mount and through the streets of Jerusalem to bring up a pitcher of living water to be poured out on the altar of the Temple. There, he is handed a silver pitcher full of wine. Pouring them out together, he prays for two things. First, he prays for rains, the former and the later rains. Then he prays “God in heaven, send Your Messiah soon and in our days. We cry out for our Mashiach (our Messiah) now.

Reader:  &quot;And the Spirit and the Bride say, &quot;Come!&quot;  And let him who hears say, &quot;Come!&quot; 
And let him who thirsts come.
Whoever desires, let him take of the water of life freely.&quot;      Revelation 22:17

6.  PRAYER FOR THE SPIRITUAL HARVEST
A traditional prayer called &quot;Tefilat Geshem&quot; is recited for rain in the coming season for the crops.   We are told to pray for the spiritual rain, the 'latter rain' to bring the last harvest of the earth to maturity.
Readings:  Zechariah 10: 1;  Joel 2:23-27  32  James 5: 7-8

      <text xml:space="preserve">SIMCHA TORAH

Blessing:  Baruch atah Yahweh, Melekh Ha 'Olam, asher natan lanu et ,  binkha k'meshichenu goalenu moshi'enu kapporatenu 	va' adonenu, ve't sifrei Torah et B'rit he Chadashah le'amenu ulekhol ha'amin
Baruch atah Adonai noten yeshu'ah b'Y'shua HaMashiach  Ashraynu!  Amein

Praise be to you, O Yahweh, King of the universe, who has give us Y'shua your son as our Mashiach, our Redeemer, our Saviour, our Atonement and our Lord, and the books of the Torah and the New Covenant to our people and to all the peoples. Praise be to You, O Yahweh , giver of Salvation in Y'shua HaMashiach.  Amen  How blessed we are!

Reader:  &quot; Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path.&quot;    Psalm 119:105

When Y'shua was at the Temple on Sukkot, He said  -
&quot;I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.&quot;   John 8:12

HAKAFOT  PROCESSION
[Two people are chosen one as the Chatan Torah (Bridegroom of the Torah) and the other as the Kallat Bereshit (the Bride of Genesis) to read the last portion of Deuteronomy and the first chapter of Genesis respectively]

Reading for the Chatan Torah:  Deut. 34: 1-12;  Joshua 1: 5-9
Reading for the Kallat Bereshit:  Genesis 1: 1-31
[Procession is made around the altar seven times while scripture is being read]

[A tallit is used as a canopy held over them as they, the Bride and the Groom, unite as a never ending circle of Torah reading]

Pronouncement:  The Word which was made flesh will unite with His Bride in an everlasting bond for all eternity. 

Reader:  &quot;Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. .. ..
Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride ordained for 	her husband.&quot;   Revelation 21: 1-2

The risen Messiah told John, &quot;Behold, I make all things new&quot; (Rev.21:5).

&quot;For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth:  and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. 
But be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create:  for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a 	joy.&quot;    Isaiah 65:17-18

&quot;For as the new heavens and the new earth which I shall make shall remain before Me, says Yahweh,
So shall your descendants and your name remain.  And it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another,
And from one Sabbath to another, all flesh shall come and worship before Me.&quot;   Isaiah 66: 22-23

BENEDICTION
Leader:  &quot;Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom, thanksgiving and honor and power and might,
Be to our God for ever and ever,  Amen&quot;   Revelation 7:12

&quot;The grace of our Lord, Y'shua the Messiah be with you all, Amen&quot;   Revelation 22:21


The Chattan Torah and the Kallat Bereshit should ideally be a male and a female  - e.g. a married couple

Candelabras can be lit for the occasion to represent the four large Menorahs which were lit in the courts of the Temple.  Y'shua referenced Himself to be the light of the world which was symbolised by the light that it shed over all the city of Jerusalem. John 8:12

      <comment>Moved 0.7.x and 0.8.x releases to the archive</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Zoph 0.8.3 to 0.8.4==
* ''If you want to upgrade from 0.8.2, first follow the [[Zoph/Upgrading#Zoph 0.8.2 to 0.8.3|upgrade instructions from 0.8.2 to 0.8.3]]''
* ''If you want to upgrade from an older version, such as 0.8 or 0.8.0.x, first follow the [[Zoph/Upgrading#Zoph 0.8 to 0.8.1|upgrade instructions from 0.8 to 0.8.1]], then the [[Zoph/Upgrading#Zoph 0.8.1 to 0.8.2|upgrade instructions from 0.8.1 to 0.8.2]], then [[Zoph/Upgrading#Zoph 0.8.2 to 0.8.3|upgrade instructions from 0.8.2 to 0.8.3]] and finally these instructions.
* If you're upgrading from an older version, it is not necessary to install the &quot;in between&quot; versions first, you can just install the current version and follow the upgrade instructions below.

Copy the '''contents''' of the &lt;tt&gt;php&lt;/tt&gt; directory, including all subdirs, into your webroot and copy the &lt;tt&gt;lang&lt;/tt&gt; directory into the webroot as well. You should make a backup copy of &lt;tt&gt;config.inc.php&lt;/tt&gt; to prevent overwriting it.
 cp config.inc.php config.local.php
 cp -a php/* /var/www/html/zoph
 cp -a lang /var/www/html/zoph

===Database changes===
Because 0.8.4 is a version &quot;in between&quot; 0.8 and 0.9, you will need to edit the update script. You should comment out the changes that have already been applied to your system. Prepend the changes for 0.8.1 and/or 0.8.3 with a &quot;#&quot;. There were no database changes in 0.8.2.
Execute zoph-update-0.9.sql:
 mysql -u zoph_admin -p zoph &lt; sql/zoph_update-0.9.sql

Changes this script makes:
* Remove the people_slots setting from the user preferences table
* Add a hash to the photos table
* Add a setting to control whether or not the user is allowed to use the sharing feature in the users table
===Configuration changes===
(see [[Zoph/Configuration]] for details):
====New options====
;[[Zoph/Configuration#SHARE|SHARE]] : Enable the possibility to share a photo by using a URL that can be used without logging in to Zoph. Once enabled, you can determine ''per user'' whether or not this user is allowed to see these URLs. (0.8.4)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#SHARE_SALT_FULL|SHARE_SALT_FULL]] : When using the SHARE feature, Zoph uses a hash to identify a photo. Because you do not want people who have access to you full size photos (via Zoph or otherwise) to be able to generate these hashes, you should give Zoph a secret salt so only authorized users of your Zoph installation can generate them. This one is used for fullsize photos (0.8.4)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#SHARE_SALT_FULL|SHARE_SALT_FULL]] : When using the SHARE feature, Zoph uses a hash to identify a photo. Because you do not want people who have access to you full size photos (via Zoph or otherwise) to be able to generate these hashes, you should give Zoph a secret salt so only authorized users of your Zoph installation can generate them. This one is used for midsize photos (0.8.4)
====Removed options====
;[[Zoph/Configuration#USE_IMAGE_SERVICE|USE_IMAGE_SERVICE]] : The Image Service is now always on. If you were previously using &lt;tt&gt;define('USE_IMAGE_SERVICE', 0)&lt;/tt&gt;, you should move your images out of your webroot, and update &lt;tt&gt;IMAGE_DIR&lt;/tt&gt; accordingly. (0.8.4)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#WEB_IMAGE_DIR|WEB_IMAGE_DIR]] : This was only needed when &lt;tt&gt;USE_IMAGE_SERVICE&lt;/tt&gt; was enabled. (0.8.4)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#MAX_PEOPLE_SLOTS|MAX_PEOPLE_SLOTS]] : The people slots feature, that allowed multiple 'add people' dropdowns on the edit photo and bulk edit photo pages has been replaced by a Javascript that automatically adds a new dropdown whenever a new person is added, allowing a virtually unlimited amount of people to be added in one edit. (0.8.4)

====Changed options====
;[[Zoph/Configuration#MAGIC_FILE|MAGIC_FILE]] : Zoph would give an error when &lt;tt&gt;MAGIC_FILE&lt;/tt&gt; was empty in Zoph 0.8.2 and 0.8.3 (it didn't exist in 0.8.1 and before). As of 0.8.4, the '''default''' and recommended value is ''empty'', letting PHP use the built-in Magic file. Only if that does not work, you can set an alternative Magic file, according to your distribution's standards. (0.8.4)

==Zoph 0.8.2 to 0.8.3==
* ''You can use these instructions to go from 0.8.2.1 to 0.8.3''
* ''If you want to upgrade from 0.8.1, first follow the [[Zoph/Upgrading#Zoph 0.8.1 to 0.8.2|upgrade instructions from 0.8.1 to 0.8.2]]''
* ''If you want to upgrade from an older version, such as 0.8 or 0.8.0.x, first follow the [[Zoph/Upgrading#Zoph 0.8 to 0.8.1|upgrade instructions from 0.8 to 0.8.1]], then the [[Zoph/Upgrading#Zoph 0.8.1 to 0.8.2|upgrade instructions from 0.8.1 to 0.8.2]] and finally these instructions.
* If you're upgrading from an older version, it is not necessary to install the &quot;in between&quot; versions first, you can just install the current version and follow the upgrade instructions below.

Copy the '''contents''' of the &lt;tt&gt;php&lt;/tt&gt; directory, including all subdirs, into your webroot and copy the &lt;tt&gt;lang&lt;/tt&gt; directory into the webroot as well. You should make a backup copy of &lt;tt&gt;config.inc.php&lt;/tt&gt; to prevent overwriting it.
 cp config.inc.php config.local.php
 cp -a php/* /var/www/html/zoph
 cp -a lang /var/www/html/zoph

===Database changes===
Because 0.8.3 is a version &quot;in between&quot; 0.8 and 0.9, you will need to edit the update script. You should comment out the changes that have already been applied to your system. Prepend the changes for 0.8.1 with a &quot;#&quot;. There were no database changes in 0.8.2.
Execute zoph-update-0.9.sql:
 mysql -u zoph_admin -p zoph &lt; sql/zoph_update-0.9.sql

==Zoph 0.8.2 to 0.8.2.1==
Copy php/* to the location of your installation. Make sure to also copy the php/lang subdirectory.

You can upgrade directly from 0.8 or 0.8.1 to 0.8.2.1, simply use the zoph-0.8.2.1.tar.gz and execute the instructions for the 0.8 to 0.8.1 and 0.8.1 to 0.8.2 upgrade.
==Zoph 0.8.1 to 0.8.2==
* ''You can use these instructions to go from 0.8.1.x to 0.8.2''
* ''If you want to upgrade from 0.8 or 0.8.0.x, first follow the [[Zoph/Upgrading#Zoph 0.8 to 0.8.1|upgrade instructions from 0.8 to 0.8.1]]''

As of 0.8.1, the &lt;tt&gt;bin&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;man&lt;/tt&gt; directories in the Zoph ''tarball'' have been replaced by the &lt;tt&gt;cli&lt;/tt&gt; directory. Also, &lt;tt&gt;zophExport.pl&lt;/tt&gt; no longer exists and &lt;tt&gt;zophImport.pl&lt;/tt&gt; has been replaced by &lt;tt&gt;zoph&lt;/tt&gt;. If you had them installed, you should remove them from your system, they are no longer supported. Don't forget to remove the manpages (&lt;tt&gt;zophImport.pl.1.gz&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;zophExport.pl.1.gz&lt;/tt&gt;) as well, they will usually be in &lt;tt&gt;/usr/share/man/man1&lt;/tt&gt;.

Copy the '''contents''' of the &lt;tt&gt;php&lt;/tt&gt; directory into your webroot and copy the &lt;tt&gt;lang&lt;/tt&gt; directory into the webroot as well. You should make a backup copy of &lt;tt&gt;config.inc.php&lt;/tt&gt; to prevent overwriting it.
 cp config.inc.php config.local.php
 cp -a php/* /var/www/html/zoph
 cp -a lang /var/www/html/zoph
 
Copy &lt;tt&gt;cli/zoph&lt;/tt&gt; into &lt;tt&gt;/bin&lt;/tt&gt; (or another directory in your &lt;tt&gt;$PATH&lt;/tt&gt;).
 cp cli/zoph /bin
Copy &lt;tt&gt;zoph.1.gz&lt;/tt&gt; into your man 1 directory (usually &lt;tt&gt;/usr/share/man/man1&lt;/tt&gt;) and zoph.ini.5.gz into man 5 (usually &lt;tt&gt;/usr/share/man/man5&lt;/tt&gt;).
 cp cli/zoph.1.gz /usr/share/man/man1
 cp cli/zoph.ini.5.gz /usr/share/man/man5
===Configuration changes===
The most important configuration change is the replacement of &lt;tt&gt;.zophrc&lt;/tt&gt; and a part of &lt;tt&gt;config.inc.php&lt;/tt&gt; by &lt;tt&gt;[[Zoph/Configuration/zoph.ini|zoph.ini]]&lt;/tt&gt;. You can use &lt;tt&gt;zoph.ini.example&lt;/tt&gt; in the &lt;tt&gt;cli&lt;/tt&gt; dir as an example.

(see [[Zoph/Configuration]] for details):
====Removed options====
The following configuration options no longer exist, you should remove them from you &lt;tt&gt;config.inc.php&lt;/tt&gt;:
;[[Zoph/Configuration#DB_HOST|DB_HOST]] : Moved to &lt;tt&gt;zoph.ini&lt;/tt&gt; (0.8.2)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#DB_NAME|DB_NAME]] : Moved to &lt;tt&gt;zoph.ini&lt;/tt&gt; (0.8.2)

;[[Zoph/Configuration#CLIENT_WEB_IMPORT|SERVER_WEB_IMPORT]] : Replaced by [[Zoph/Configuration#IMPORT|IMPORT]] (0.8.2)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#DEFAULT_DESTINATION_PATH|DEFAULT_DESTINATION_PATH]] : Due to introduction of [[Zoph/Configuration#IMPORT_DIR|IMPORT_DIR]] no longer necessary (0.8.2)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#SHOW_DESTINATION_PATH|SHOW_DESTINATION_PATH]] : Due to introduction of [[Zoph/Configuration#IMPORT_DIR|IMPORT_DIR]] no longer necessary (0.8.2)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#REMOVE_ARCHIVE|REMOVE_ARCHIVE]] : As of Zoph 0.8.2, Zoph always removes an archive after a successful decompress  (0.8.2)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#IMPORT_MOVE|IMPORT_MOVE]] : Due to introduction of [[Zoph/Configuration#IMPORT_DIR|IMPORT_DIR]], Zoph always moves files (0.8.2)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#IMPORT_UMASK|IMPORT_UMASK]] : Replaced by [[Zoph/Configuration#FILE_MODE|FILE_MODE]] (0.8.2)
====New options====
;[[Zoph/Configuration#CLI_USER|CLI_USER]] : User id that the CLI client uses to connect to Zoph. Must be admin. Change this into '0' to let Zoph lookup the user from the Unix user that is running Zoph. (0.8.2)

===Database changes===
No database changed need to be made for Zoph 0.8.2

==Zoph 0.8.1 to 0.8.1.x==
* ''You can use these instructions to go from 0.8.1 to 0.8.1.2''
* ''You can also use these instructions to go from 0.8.1.1 to 0.8.1.2''
Copy php/* to the location of your installation. Make sure to also copy the php/lang subdirectory.

You can upgrade directly from 0.8 to 0.8.1.2, simply use the zoph-0.8.1.2.tar.gz and execute the instructions for the 0.8 to 0.8.1 upgrade.

==Zoph 0.8 to 0.8.0.x==
* ''You can also use these instructions to go from 0.8.0.1 to 0.8.0.2, 0.8.0.3 or 0.8.0.4''
Copy php/* to the location of your installation. Make sure to also copy the php/lang subdirectory.

You can upgrade directly from 0.7 to 0.8.0.x, simply use the zoph-0.8.0.x.tar.gz and execute the instructions for the 0.7 to 0.8 upgrade.

==Zoph 0.8 to 0.8.1==
* Follow the upgrade instructions to 0.8 first if you are using an older version. ''(no need to really download and install v0.8, just execute the upgrade instructions)''.

Copy &lt;tt&gt;php/*&lt;/tt&gt; to the location of your installation. Make sure that you also copy the &lt;tt&gt;js&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;img&lt;/tt&gt; subdirectories.
If you use the translations in Zoph, make sure to also copy the &lt;tt&gt;lang&lt;/tt&gt; directory.

You can upgrade directly from 0.8 to 0.8.1.x, simply use the zoph-0.8.1.x.tar.gz and execute the instructions for the 0.8 to 0.8.1 upgrade.
===Updating the database===
Zoph 0.8.1 requires a manual upgrade to the database, this is described in [[Zoph/Upgrading/Changing_your_database_to_UTF-8|Changing your database to UTF-8]].

Execute zoph-update-0.9.sql:
 mysql -u zoph_admin -p zoph &lt; sql/zoph_update-0.9.sql
Change &lt;tt&gt;zoph&lt;/tt&gt; into &lt;tt&gt;zophutf8&lt;/tt&gt; if you are working on the temporary database.

The database upgrade script makes the following changes:
* Make the language field in the prefs table longer so languages like en-ca can be stored (0.8.1)

* ''For an update from 0.7.5 or 0.8pre1 - 3, see [[Zoph/Upgrading#Zoph_0.7.5_or_0.8_pre-release_to_0.8|Zoph 0.7.5 or 0.8 pre-release to 0.8]]''

Copy &lt;tt&gt;php/*&lt;/tt&gt; to the location of your installation. Make sure that you also copy the &lt;tt&gt;js&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;img&lt;/tt&gt; subdirectories.
If you use the translations in Zoph, make sure to also copy the &lt;tt&gt;lang&lt;/tt&gt; directory.

Copy bin/zophImport.pl into the directory where you installed it, if you followed the installation instructions it is probably &lt;tt&gt;/usr/local/bin&lt;/tt&gt;, otherwise, find out with &lt;tt&gt;which zophImport.pl&lt;/tt&gt;.

===Updating the Database===
If you are upgrading from an older version than 0.7, please run the older database updates first.

Execute zoph-update-0.8.sql:

 mysql -u zoph_admin -p zoph &lt; sql/zoph_update-0.8.sql

The database upgrade script makes the following changes:
* Add the 'sortname' column to the albums and categories tables (0.7.1)
* Add preferences field to let users define the sort order (0.7.1)
* Add a column to the users table that defines whether or not this user is allowed to download photos. (0.7.1)
* Create tables zoph_pages, zoph_pageset and zoph_pages_pageset (0.72)
* Add a 'pageset' field to zoph_albums, zoph_categories, zoph_places and zoph_people columns (0.7.2).
* Add columns to the places and photos table to store the geographic location of that photo or place (0.7.3)

* Create a table to store saved searches (0.7.5)

===Configuration updates===
(see [[Zoph/Configuration]] for details):
====New options====
* [[Zoph/Configuration#MAPS|MAPS]] (0.7.3)
* [[Zoph/Configuration#GOOGLE_KEY|GOOGLE_KEY]] (0.7.3)
* [[Zoph/Configuration#CAMERA_TZ|CAMERA_TZ]] (0.7.3)
* [[Zoph/Configuration#DATE_FORMAT|DATE_FORMAT]] (0.7.3)
* [[Zoph/Configuration#TIME_FORMAT|TIME_FORMAT]] (0.7.3)

* [[Zoph/Configuration#IMPORT_MOVE|IMPORT_MOVE]] (0.7.1)
* [[Zoph/Configuration#DOWNLOAD|DOWNLOAD]] (0.7.1)

===Group access rights===
As of Zoph 0.7.4, you have to make your users members of a group and then assign viewing rights for albums to the group, instead of to the users directly. After the update to 0.7.4, you will have no groups and therefore your users will not be allowed to see any photos, you should create one or more groups, make your user member of one or more of them and assign viewing rights to the groups. If you'd rather stay with your current per-user viewing rights, you can use the &lt;tt&gt;user_to_group.php&lt;/tt&gt; script in the &lt;tt&gt;contrib&lt;/tt&gt; directory: this will create a new group for each user and assign the currently defined access rights for each user the newly created groups. To use this script:
# Make a backup of your current Zoph database;
# Copy the &lt;tt&gt;users_to_group.php&lt;/tt&gt; script into your Zoph php directory;
# Log in to Zoph with an admin user;
# Did I mention making a backup?
# Change the part after the last &lt;tt&gt;/&lt;/tt&gt; in your browser into &lt;tt&gt;user_to_group.php&lt;/tt&gt;;
After this, you can remove the &lt;tt&gt;zoph_album_permissions&lt;/tt&gt; table in Zoph, as it is no longer used.

==Zoph 0.7.x to 0.8 update==
* ''Except 0.7.5, see [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Zoph/Upgrading#Zoph_0.7.5_or_0.8_pre-release_to_0.8 Zoph 0.7.5 or 0.8 pre-release to 0.8]''
If you have previously upgraded to a feature release (0.7.1, 0.7.2, 0.7.3 or 0.7.4), you need to edit &lt;tt&gt;zoph-update-0.8.sql&lt;/tt&gt;. You should comment out the changes that have already been applied to your system. For example, if you are upgrading from 0.7.1 to 0.8, you will need to prepend the changes for 0.7.1 with a &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt;, since you have already applied those changes when you updated to 0.7.1. After that, you can follow the instructions for 0.7 to 0.8

==Zoph 0.7.5 or 0.8 pre-release to 0.8==
If you are upgrading from 0.7.5 or or a 0.8 pre-release to 0.8, you don't need to run any database scripts, there are no database changes in this upgrade.

Follow the instructions for 0.7 to 0.8, but skip the database upgrades.
==Zoph 0.7 to Zoph 0.7.0.x==
Copy php/* to the location of your installation. Make sure to also copy the php/lang subdirectory.

You can upgrade directly from 0.6 to 0.7.0.x, simply use the zoph-0.7.0.x.tar.gz and execute the instructions for the 0.6 to 0.7 upgrade.


==Zoph 0.6 -&gt; 0.7 update==
Copy php/* to the location of your installation. Make sure to also copy the php/lang subdirectory.

===Updating the Database===
If you are upgrading from an older version than 0.6, please run the older database updates first.

Execute zoph-update-0.7.sql:

 &gt; mysql -u zoph_admin -p zoph &lt; sql/zoph_update-0.7.sql

The database upgrade script makes the following changes:
* Adds preference fields for &quot;show all exif&quot;, autocomplete, view and autothumb features
* Adds coverphoto field to albums, categories, places and people.

===Configuration updates===
(see [[Zoph/Configuration]] for details):
====New options====
* [[Zoph/Configuration#JAVASCRIPT|JAVASCRIPT]]
* [[Zoph/Configuration#AUTOCOMPLETE|AUTOCOMPLETE]]

===Perl script changes===
As of v0.7, you can set some defaults for &lt;tt&gt;zophImport.pl&lt;/tt&gt; from &lt;tt&gt;.zophrc&lt;/tt&gt;. The example file &lt;tt&gt;zophrc.sample&lt;/tt&gt; has been updated with these settings:

&lt;pre&gt;
$datedDirs = 0;
$copy = 0;
$hierarchical = 0;
$verbose = 0;
$resolveSymlinks = 0;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;zophImport.pl&lt;/tt&gt; now has an option to resolve symlinks during import. For more details, see [[Zoph/Using the commandline tools|Using the commandline tools]]

==Zoph 0.5.x -&gt; 0.6 update==
Copy php/* to the location of your installation. Make sure to also copy the php/lang subdirectory.

===Updating the Database===
If you are upgrading from an older version than 0.5, please run the older database updates first. It is not necessary to update to 0.5.1 if you are still running 0.5.

Execute zoph-update-0.6.sql:

 &gt; mysql -u zoph_admin -p zoph &lt; sql/zoph_update-0.6.sql

The database upgrade script makes the following changes:
* Add sortorder fields to albums and categories
* Add url + description fields to places
* Make changes needed for user comments:
** Add table for comments
** Add table to link comments to a photo
** Add a field to a user to indicate whether or not this user can make comments
* Add a table to create relations between photos
* Change the rating field length, because it couldn't hold a 10 and was truncated to 0 decimals in a previous version.

===Configuration updates===
(see [[Zoph/Configuration]] for details):
====New options====
* [[Zoph/Configuration#ALLOW_COMMENTS|ALLOW_COMMENTS]]
* [[Zoph/Configuration#MAX_UPLOAD|MAX_UPLOAD]] (was hardcoded to 10MB in 0.5.1 and before)

====Changed options====
* [[Zoph/Configuration#USE_IMAGE_SERVICE|USE_IMAGE_SERVICE]] is now on by default
* [[Zoph/Configuration#DEFAULT_TABLE_WIDTH|DEFAULT_TABLE_WIDTH]] again has support for % (this was accidently removed in 0.5), please note that it is now required to specify the entity (&quot;px&quot; or &quot;%&quot;).

===Perl script changes===
As of v0.6, no settings need to be made in &lt;tt&gt;zophImport.pl&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;zophExport.pl&lt;/tt&gt;, it is replaced by a settings file &lt;tt&gt;.zophrc&lt;/tt&gt; in the home directory of the user that runs these scripts. An example file called &lt;tt&gt;zophrc.sample&lt;/tt&gt; is included with Zoph:

&lt;pre&gt;
#-----------------------------------------
# Configuration file for Zoph
#-----------------------------------------
#
# Rename this file to .zophrc and place it in your home directory.
#
# All settings must match the settings with the same name in config.inc.php
#
# edit these to reflect your database
$db_host = 'localhost';  # hostname or hostname:port
$db_name = 'zoph';
$db_user = 'zoph_rw';
$db_pass = 'pass';
$db_prefix = 'zoph_';

#
# set this to your image directory
#
$image_dir = '/data/images/';
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note: the Debian version of Zoph was already using this configuration.

==Zoph 0.5 -&gt; 0.5.1 Upgrade==
Copy over php/* to the location of your installation. Make sure to also copy the php/lang subdirectory.
No datebase changes are needed for this release.

==Zoph 0.4 -&gt; 0.5 Upgrade==
Copy over php/* to the location of your installation. Make sure to also copy the php/lang subdirectory.
===Updating the Database===

If you are upgrading from an older version than 0.4, please run the older database updates first.

Execute zoph-update-0.5.sql:

 &gt; mysql -u zoph_admin -p zoph &lt; sql/zoph_update-0.5.sql

The database upgrade script makes the following changes:
* Change the password length to 64 bytes. Needed for Mysql 4.1 compatibility.
* Changes to the places table for hierarchical locations:
** add the parent_place_id column.
** copy the location that currently has place_id 1 to a new place_id.
** Update all the photos taken at that location
** Change place_id 1 to &quot;World&quot; (You may want to change that)
** And finally makes all the other places a child of &quot;World&quot;.
* Add a column to the prefs table for opening fullsize photos in a new Window
* Add a column to the album_permissions table for the watermarking feature

===Configuration updates===
A few new configuration options have been added in Zoph 0.5.

====Forcing SSL====
You can now force the usage of SSL for the web interface, either just for logging on or for the entire Zoph session. You can control the behaviour by adepting the following settings:
 define('FORCE_SSL_LOGIN', 0);
 define('FORCE_SSL', 0);
You will also need to tell Zoph at what URL it can be found, because it will need to redirect users from SSL to plain and vice versa:
 define('ZOPH_URL', 'http://myserver.com/zoph');
 define('ZOPH_SECURE_URL', 'https://myserver.com/zoph');

For more details see [[Zoph/Configuration#FORCE_SSL_LOGIN|FORCE_SSL_LOGIN]], [[Zoph/Configuration#FORCE_SSL|FORCE_SSL]], [[Zoph/Configuration#ZOPH_URL|ZOPH_URL]] and [[Zoph/Configuration#ZOPH_SECURE_URL|ZOPH_SECURE_URL]].

====Using watermarks====
You can now have Zoph add a watermark to the high resolution images, to prevent unauthorized use of your photos. The watermark is a partly transparant GIF image that needs to be placed in your IMAGE_DIR. To use watermarking, make the following changes to your configuration:

 define('WATERMARKING', 1);
 define('WATERMARK', 'watermark.gif');
You will also need to enable the image service if you have not already done so:
 define('USE_IMAGE_SERVICE', 1);

For more details see [[Zoph/Configuration#WATERMARKING|WATERMARKING]], [[Zoph/Configuration#WATERMARK|WATERMARK]] and [[Zoph/Configuration#USE_IMAGE_SERVICE|USE_IMAGE_SERVICE]].

====Web import changes====
A few changes have been made to the web importer.
To delete an uploaded ZIP file after a successful import, change this line in the configuration:
 define('REMOVE_ARCHIVE', 1);
To enable dated directories in the Web importer:
 define('USE_DATED_DIRS', 1);
 define('HIER_DATED_DIRS', 0);
To enable hierarchical dated directories in the Web importer:
 define('USE_DATED_DIRS', 1);
 define('HIER_DATED_DIRS', 1);

The default UMASK and DIR_MODE have been changed as of v0.5:
 define('IMPORT_UMASK', 022);
 define('DIR_MODE', 0755);

For more detais, see [[Zoph/Configuration#REMOVE_ARCHIVE|REMOVE_ARCHIVE]], [[Zoph/Configuration#USE_DATED_DIRS|USE_DATED_DIRS]],  [[Zoph/Configuration#HIER_DATED_DIRS|HIER_DATED_DIRS]], [[Zoph/Configuration#IMPORT_UMASK|IMPORT_UMASK]] and [[Zoph/Configuration#DIR_MODE|DIR_MODE]].

====Adding multiple people at once====
You can now add multiple people at once using the edit photo page or the bulk edit mode. To enable this feature, set MAX_PEOPLE_SLOTS to a reasonable maximum (recommendation: 5-10). 
 define('MAX_PEOPLE_SLOTS', 5);
After that, go to the preference page and set &quot;number of people to add at once&quot; to a number that is convenient for that user. Each user can indivually set this number, but never higher than the number defined in MAX_PEOPLE_SLOTS.
Bear in mind that setting either to a (very) high number, could (severely) impact performance.

For more detais, see [[Zoph/Configuration#MAX_PEOPLE_SLOTS|MAX_PEOPLE_SLOTS]]
==Zoph 0.3.3 -&gt; 0.4 Upgrade==
Copy over php/* to the location of your installation. Make sure to also copy the php/lang subdirectory.
===Updating the Database===

If you are upgrading from an older version than 0.3.3, please run the older database updates first. If you have been using a 0.4-pre version, you do not need to update the database again.

Execute zoph-update-0.4.sql:

 &gt; mysql -u zoph_admin -p zoph &lt; sql/zoph_update-0.4.sql

The database upgrade script makes the following changes:

* Changes the name of all the tables to zoph_&lt;old name&gt;. If you do not want this, comment out the lines starting with &quot;rename table&quot;. Make sure the variable DB_PREFIX in config.inc.php and $db_prefix in zophImport and zophExport match your choice.
* Adds a few columns to zoph_album_permissions and zoph_users, to be able to monitor such as changes to permissions and last login.
* Adds &quot;email&quot; to people.
* Makes modifications for the new rating system, where multiple ratings can be done on a single photo and average is calculated automatically.

===Updating configuration===
A number of configuration items have been added since v0.3.3. You can use the list below to update your current configuration file, or simply use the one in the distribution and change it to your needs.

Set DB_PREFIX to a prefix for each tablename, see db update for details. Suggested is to use 'zoph_', as this will be the default in future releases. Make sure $db_prefix in zophImport.pl and zophExport.pl matches this setting.

Much of the style information has been removed from the HTML code and is now in a separate CSS file. Please set CSS_SHEET to 'css.php' to load the CSS file.

You can now choose the authentication method used by zoph; set $VALIDATOR accordingly. Possible choices:

'default_validate':
    use the 'old' authentication method, probably the best choice for most.
'htpasswd_validate':
    use htpasswd to validate users.
'php_validate':
    let PHP take care of validation. See http://www.php.net/features.http-auth

You could also write your own authentication module; make it a function in validator.inc.php and set $VALIDATOR to it's name.

You can automatically send a copy of each e-mail sent from Zoph to a predefined address by setting BCC_ADDRESS to that address. Zoph includes a link to the site when notifying a user of (new) access rights. If Zoph is unable to determine the correct URL itself, please set ZOPH_URL to the correct value.

If you want to be able to annotate photo's, set ANNOTATE_PHOTOS to 1 and set ANNOTATE_TEMP_DIR and ANNOTATE_TEMP_PREFIX to a sensible value (suggested: '/tmp' and 'zoph').

To set the destination path in the web import to some default value, define the variable DEFAULT_DESTINATION_PATH; suggested value: 'uploads/date(Y.m.d)'. To hide this path from non-admin users, also define SHOW_DESTINATION_PATH and set it to 0, if you do not want to hide it, set it to 1.

To allow users to rate photos, set ALLOW_RATINGS to 1; otherwise to 0.

Zoph can now rotate images for you. Add the following settings and adapt where needed:
 // allow images to be rotated
 define('ALLOW_ROTATIONS', 1);
 define(ROTATE_CMD, 'convert');
 //define('ROTATE_CMD', 'jpegtran');
 // set to 1 to backup the original before it is rotated
 define('BACKUP_ORIGINAL', 1);
 // copy the original to a file with this prefix
 define('BACKUP_PREFIX', 'orig_');

==Zoph 0.3.2 -&gt; 0.3.3 Upgrade==
If you are upgrading from a version previous to 0.3.2, please run the older database updates first.
===Updating the Database===
This update adds a new column to the prefs table.

Execute zoph-update-0.3.3.sql:

 &gt; mysql -u zoph_admin -p zoph &lt; sql/zoph_update-0.3.3.sql

===Updating the Templates===
Copy over php/* to the location of your installation (back up your old config.inc.php first if you need to). Make sure to also copy the php/lang subdirectory as there are additions to the language files.

There are a few new settings in config.inc.php. The old WEB_IMPORT setting was replaced with CLIENT_WEB_IMPORT and SERVER_WEB_IMPORT so that you can enable/disable one or the other if you like.

This release also supports the uploading of zip and tar files. Set the UNZIP_CMD and/or UNTAR_CMD to enable this. This feature extracts the images to a temp folder before loading them. The path to this folder is set by EXTRACT_DIR.

Another new feature is the addition of a pref to let photo descriptions appear under the thumbnails. The MAX_THUMB_DESC config sets the maximum number of characters to display.

===A New Export Script===

You'll find a new perl script in this release, bin/zophExport.pl, which can be used to create static html galleries of your photos. See the manual for more info.
==Zoph 0.3.1 -&gt; 0.3.2 Upgrade==
If you are upgrading from a version previous to 0.3.1, please run the older database updates first.

===Updating the Database===
The only thing added in this update are four new color schemes. You an skip this if you don't think you will use them.

Execute the statements in zoph-update-0.3.2.sql:

 &gt; mysql -u zoph_admin -p zoph &lt; sql/zoph_update-0.3.2.sql

===Updating the Templates===
Copy over php/* to the location of your installation. Make sure to also copy the php/lang subdirectory as there are additions to the language files. Also included in this release are the htmlized docs, in the php/docs/ directory, if you want them.

There are two new additions to config.inc.php: a VERSION variable and the DEFAULT_SHOW_ALL setting. The DEFAULT_SHOW_ALL setting makes all people or places shown by default when you visit the people or places pages. If you don't have hundreds of records this is probably more convenient than defaulting to 'a'. It is enabled by default.

That's it for this release, but I'll mention one bug fix for a problem a few users may have noticed: if you used zophImport.pl to load images that were on a different filesystem than your images directory, everything would apparently work but the original images would not be copied. You might not have even noticed the images were missing unless you tried to view the full sized images in your browser. This release fixes this problem and makes sure other sorts of silent failure won't occur.
==Zoph 0.3 -&gt; 0.3.1 Upgrade==
If you are upgrading from a version less than 0.3, please run the previous database updates first.
===Updating the Database===
Execute the statements in zoph-update-0.3.1.sql:

 &gt; mysql -u zoph_admin -p zoph &lt; sql/zoph_update-0.3.1.sql

None of the database changes should create incompatibility with version 0.3. You should update the database before updating the templates.

This database update attempts to delete some table accidentally included in zoph.sql in version 0.3. If you originally installed a prior version you probably do not have these tables and the update will fail when the &quot;drop table&quot; statements are reached. That isn't a problem, the other statements should have successfully executed first.
===Updating the Templates===
Copy over php/* to the location of your installation. Make sure to also copy the php/lang subdirectory.

There are no changes to config.inc.php this release so you can backup your version and then copy it over again.
==Zoph 0.2.1 -&gt; 0.3 Upgrade==
If you are upgrading from Zoph 0.2, first update the database as described in the &quot;Zoph 0.2 -&gt; 0.2.1 Upgrade&quot; section below.
Updating the Database

Execute the statements in zoph-update-0.3.sql:
 &gt; mysql -u zoph_admin -p zoph &lt; sql/zoph_update-0.3.sql

None of the database changes should create incompatibility with version 0.2.1. You should update the database before updating the templates.
===Updating the Templates===

Copy over php/* to the location of your installation. Make sure to also copy the new php/lang and php/images subdirectories.

You may want to first backup your config.inc.php so you can copy your database settings over to the new config file.

Section 3 of the INSTALL file, &quot;Configuring the PHP templates&quot;, has been updated to include information on the new config file settings.

The REQUIREMENTS document has info on what is need to use the new web importer.

The TUTORIAL has been updated to include information on using the web importer and viewing Zoph in other languages.

The db.inc.php template isn't needed anymore (and wasn't in the last release either, but it was accidentally included in the download). You can delete it if you like if it's still in your template directory.

If you are running PHP 4.2 and had to enable register_globals to get Zoph to work, with Zoph 0.3 this is no longer required. It is recommended that you disable register_globals in php.ini now. Also, to use the web importer you may need to increase the max_execution_time in php.ini to something more than the default of 30 seconds.
===Configuration Changes===
In versions of Zoph prior to 0.3, thumbnails were generated as the same file type as the original image (a jpeg image would have jpeg thumbnails, a gif image gif thumbnails, etc). As it may be desirable to instead have all thumbnails be the same type (there probably is no need, for example, to create uncompressed tiff thumbnails of tiff images), Zoph 0.3 allows you to specify that all thumbnails should be of the same type.

If all your images are the same type or if you don't mind having different sorts of thumbnails, you can skip this.

The default settings maintain compatibility with previous versions. If you would like to switch to a single thumbnail format, do the following:

In zophImport.pl
* set $mixed_thumbnails to 1
* set $thumb_extension to whatever you like (jpg, for example) 

In config.inc.php set MIXED_THUMBNAILS and THUMB_EXTENSION to the same values as zophImport.pl.

If you make this change and have previously generated thumbnails with an extension different from THUMB_EXTENSION, you will need to regenerate the old thumbnails. A command like the following can take care of that (this one finds gifs and makes jpgs):

 &gt; find images/ -name &quot;thumb_*.gif&quot; -o -name &quot;mid_*.gif&quot; | perl -nle '$old = $_; s/\.(\w+)$/.jpg/; $cmd = &quot;convert $old $_&quot;; print $cmd; system($cmd);'

You can then get rid of the old thumbnails.
===Preferences Changes===

There are two new settings on the prefs page:

&quot;Days past for recent photos links&quot; sets the number of days used for the recently taken/modified links on the home page.

&quot;Language&quot; set the language to display. See the TUTORIAL for more info.
===The PHP Importer===
This version comes with a web based importer. If you are planning to use this feature you may need to install the following:

* GD 2.0
* PHP 4.2 

See the first section of the REQUIREMENTS doc for more info.
==Zoph 0.2 -&gt; 0.2.1 Upgrade==
If you already have Zoph 0.2 installed, upgrading is fairly simple.
===Updating the Database===

Execute the statements in zoph-update-0.2.1.sql:

 &gt; mysql -u zoph_admin -p zoph &lt; sql/zoph_update-0.2.1.sql

None of the database changes should create incompatibility with version 0.2. You should update the db before updating the templates.
===Updating the Templates===

Simply copy over php/* to the location of your installation. You may want to first backup your config.inc.php then copy it over.

If you do keep you previous config.inc.php, be aware of one addition to that file. Copy the lines defining the DEFAULT_USER from the new config.inc.php to your file.

If you plan on using the new default (guest) user feature, read &quot;Defining a Default User&quot; in the &quot;Creating Users&quot; section of the tutorial.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here's some notes I am working on in preparation for the seminar class dedicated to Plato, Orality, and Book VII of the Republic:

The subjects Plato selects for learning all stress abstraction over sensual perception: arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, and (eventually) dialectic. With a few subjects, including astronomy and music, Plato is careful to insist that they are studied for their ability to summon abstract problems rather than studied either as perceptible bodies (in the case of astronomy), for their harmonious beauty (the case of music), or practicality (the case of geometry) (see 522-525). Plato repeatedly insists that education should not be a mere gaining of sight (see particularly his distinction between the visible and the intelligible at 532).This is, of course, connected to Plato's rigorous commitment to Being and opposition to becoming, stated in several places throughout Book VII. 

Plato maintains that a student must study in these realms until the age of 30 before they are introduced to the dangerous, but necessary, art of argumentation. After five years of intensive training in argument, careful to avoid any sophistic or eristic defiencies, a student is prepared for dialectical examination. By age 50, those completing dialectical examination are deemed fit to rule. 

Overall, Plato's metaphysical conception of logos inspires a political utopia. Plato argues that true philosophers care only for the pursuit of a &quot;good and rational life&quot; (521). Philosopher kings, far from desiring power, must be compelled to rule. Anyone who wants to rule is clearly unfit for the job (see VII).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi, I wrote the other page (the one made in January 2009) and these two should be merged.  I tried to be as short and concise as possible, but the addition of examples adds something in my opinion, perhaps I can merge the examples into the other form, and then one of the pages can be deleted.

:Sure merge the two pages under one location, then add {{tlx|now merged}} to the top of the old one, this will allow an administrator to take care of merging the histories. Examples are always good and it is too bad this page was orphaned at the time you made your contribution to the other page. Feel free to ask me if you want any help in any way.

== Ingredients ==
*18 ounces ground chuck
*18 ounces ground sirloin
*6 ounces garlic-flavored croutons 
*1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper 
*1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 
*1 teaspoon chili powder 
*1 teaspoon dried thyme 
*1/2 onion, roughly chopped 
*1 carrot, peeled and broken 
*3 whole cloves garlic 
*1/2 red bell pepper 
*1 1/2 teaspoon salt 
*1 egg 
'''Glaze'''
*1/2 cup barbecue sauce
*1 1/2 tbs Worcestershire sauce
*2 tbs Tabasco or something that tastes like it
*1 tbs blackstrap molasses

== Procedure ==
#Heat oven to 325 degrees F. 
#In a food processor bowl, combine croutons, black pepper, cayenne pepper, chili powder, and thyme. Pulse until the mixture is of a fine texture. #Place this mixture into a large bowl and set aside.
#Combine the onion, carrot, garlic, and red pepper in the food processor bowl. Pulse until the mixture is finely chopped, but not pureed.
#Combine the vegetable mixture, ground sirloin, and ground chuck with the bread crumb mixture.
#Season the meat mixture with the salt and add the egg.
#Combine thoroughly, but avoid squeezing the meat. 
#Pack this mixture into a 10-inch loaf pan to mold the shape of the meatloaf. Onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, turn the meatloaf out of the pan onto the center of the tray.
#Insert a temperature probe at a 45 degree angle into the top of the meatloaf. Avoid touching the bottom of the tray with the probe. Set the probe for 155 degrees F. 
#Combine the glaze ingredients. Brush the glaze onto the meatloaf after it has been cooking for about 10 minutes.
#Once the meatloaf has reached 155 degrees F, take it out of the oven and let it sit for about 8-10 minutes before serving.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Procedural Content Generation ===
The concept is defined as the process of procedurally generating any type of 2D/3D geometry, textures, scripts or sound, even using a randomization seed. To date this technique is primarily used to create environments, simple worlds or structures. This approach can also be applied to many other content, using strict definitions it can be used in cooperative work with AI (dynamic environments, object and creatures), but it is still difficult to be as reliable as realistic as traditional animation, even if it can provide greater variability and in replicating human voice it is still at its infancy.

Unless there is a benefits for interactivity or to enable randomization, procedural content generation should be avoided as it is expensive in terms of CPU cycles and generally complex to implement, exceptions are made to repetitive but simple patterns, even if interaction is not possible, for instance in the simulation of water, the effect of rain or even the display of clouds, smoke, fire or explosions. A less important factor that may prompt the use of procedural content generation are space (size) restrictions in the finished product, due to the media to be used or the size of the download.

When creating a game there are some features that will aid the gamer to be able to easily interact in the virtual environment created. If simulating real environments this is extremely important since realism is expected, from object trajectories to how they collide, the feeling of mass and how fluid behave and other similar behaviors can all be modeled in conformance to well understood formulas that are also valid on the real word.

      <comment>Code simplification</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I've got a few problems about the content of this chapter:

1. The section &quot;Grammars&quot; describes them essentially as syntactical sugar for regexps, while they are intended to understand a wider class of strings than regexps

2. Subsection &quot;Tokens&quot; says &quot;Tokens are are regex that don't backtrack&quot; (btw., &quot;are&quot; is duplicated).  If this were true, the code 

  token protocol {
    'http'|'https'|'ftp'|'file'
  }

in the next subsection should be unable to parse &quot;https://foo.bar.com&quot;, since the non-backtracking token would get stuck on &quot;http&quot; and the grammar would then miss the expected &quot;://&quot;, running into an unexpected 's'.  This is a problem not only of regexps, but even of LL-Parsers.

Unfortunately I don't know (my parrot is still compiling) whether the code works (and therefore the subsection &quot;Tokens&quot; is wrong) or vice versa.  That's why I wrote a comment instead of changing the text. [[User:Ralf Muschall|Ralf Muschall]] ([[User talk:Ralf Muschall|talk]]) 10:39, 27 August 2009 (UTC)--

In the meantime, I did some tests and readings.  There are the keywords &quot;token&quot;, &quot;rule&quot; and &quot;regex&quot;.  &quot;regex&quot; does what one would naively expect, the other two suppress backtracking.  &quot;rule&quot; in addition means that whitespace is significant, i.e.

 rule URL {
   &lt;protocol&gt; '://' &lt;address&gt;
 }

would not work.  The grammar is a PEG (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar), i.e. left-recursions must be eliminated by left-factoring, but this is somewhat more powerful than a CFG. 
The simplest way to fix this section would probably be to grab stuff from the Wikipedia articles PEG and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_6_rules, and to use a few tested examples.  [[User:Ralf Muschall|Ralf Muschall]] ([[User talk:Ralf Muschall|talk]]) 08:30, 28 August 2009 (UTC)--

I have fixed the examples so they at least mostly work, although I am not sure how good the examples for rules are. BTW. You are correct about https not working but the version I have given in the protos section should as the longest token will be chosen. I have some more complete code for a basic mathematical expression parser which might make better examples (after being simplified) and would also demonstrate actions, if people think it would be more appropriate:
&lt;source lang='perl'&gt;
use v6;

grammar Math::Grammar {
	token NonZeroDigit { &lt;[1..9]&gt; }
	token Digit { &lt;[0..9]&gt; }
	token Sign { &lt;[+\-]&gt; }
	token OptionalSign { &lt;Sign&gt;? }
	token Integer { &lt;NonZeroDigit&gt;&lt;Digit&gt;* }
	token Float { &lt;Integer&gt; \. &lt;Digit&gt;+ }
	proto token Atom { &lt;...&gt; }
	token Atom:sym&lt;Real&gt; { &lt;Integer&gt; | &lt;Float&gt; }
	token Atom:sym&lt;Imaginary&gt; { &lt;[ij]&gt; }
	token Atom:sym&lt;Variable&gt; { &lt;[a..z] - [ij]&gt; }
	token Atom:sym&lt;Brackets&gt; { '(' &lt;Sum&gt; ')' }
	token Power { &lt;Atom&gt; [\^ &lt;Atom&gt;]* }
	token Division { &lt;Power&gt; [\s?\/\s? &lt;Power&gt;]* }
	token Product { &lt;Division&gt; [[\s?\*\s?]? &lt;Division&gt;]* }
	token Sum { &lt;OptionalSign&gt; &lt;Product&gt; [\s? &lt;Sign&gt; \s? &lt;Product&gt;]* }
	rule TOP { ^^ &lt;Sum&gt; $$ }
}

class Math::Actions {
	method TOP ($/) { make $&lt;Sum&gt;.ast }
	method Atom:sym&lt;Real&gt; ($/) { make +$/ }
	method Atom:sym&lt;Brackets&gt; ($/) { make $&lt;Sum&gt;.ast }
	method Atom:sym&lt;Imaginary&gt; ($/) { make i }
	method Power ($/) { make [**] $&lt;Atom&gt;».ast }
	method Division ($/) { make [/] $&lt;Power&gt;».ast }
	method Product ($/) { make [*] $&lt;Division&gt;».ast }
	method Sign ($/) { make ($/ ~~ '+') ?? 1 !! -1 }
	method OptionalSign ($/) { make ($/ ~~ '-') ?? -1 !! 1 }
	method Sum ($/) {
		make [+] ($&lt;OptionalSign&gt;.ast, $&lt;Sign&gt;».ast) »*« $&lt;Product&gt;».ast
	}
}

my $actions = Math::Actions.new();
say Math::Grammar.parse(prompt('enter an expression: '), :$actions).ast;

Quality/Expectations

5 Questions

1. In your own words, how would you describe the quality of today's educational curriculum?

2. What conclusion could you draw from a teacher with poor teaching quality in respect to the learning quality?

3. How could parents and friends help the teacher to achieve a positive learning outcome?

4. What are 3 ways the community could get involved with helping to improve the quality of learning and teaching?

5. How do you feel about courses on religion being taught in schools and how could this change the quality of learning and current expectations?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm asking if anyone objects to me removing the &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; example. ASCII tab is fine for simple examples but with bends and pull-offs presents a extremely difficult tab for beginners to decipher. I won't remove it until I've found a suitable replacement using scoring software. If you wish to revert back to the ASCII tab, please do so.

==Indications==
*Thyroid cancer - Either localized or metastatic
*Benign disease refractory to conservative treatment and/or causing symptoms or complications

==Procedure==
*Calculation of dose
**The dose should be calculated with two different variables: The '''weight of the gland'''(in grams), and how much it's '''24 hr uptake''' is (For example, 24% would be 0.24).  You can then use the following formula:

 &lt;math&gt;\text{Required dose} (microCi)=\frac{Size~in~grams \cdot (100~to~180microCi)}{24~hour~%RAIU}&lt;/math&gt;
**The weight of the gland is a very subjective measurement.  One can attempt to approximate the gland weight with the following guidelines:
***A regular ''non-palpable'' thyroid gland weighs approximately '''15-20 grams'''.
***A thyroid that you cannot see but is ''palpable'' weighs approximately '''30-40 grams''' (needs verification)
***A gland that is easily seen and palpated can be anywhere from '''40-200 grams''' (needs verification)

      <comment>/* GROUP A: Small experimental franks used without town mark */ --~~~~</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">= Austria =

&lt;font size=3&gt;
* Most meter stamps of the country are inscribed “ÖSTERREICH”. Meters used during the German occupation from 1938 to 1945 had franks indistinguishable from those of Germany and can be identified only by an Austrian town name. After World War 2 several of the German style meters were defaced or altered to remove the Nazi identity, and these, also, can be identified as Austrian only by the town name. Some Post Due stamp types do not contain the country name. These can be identified by the inscription “NACHGEBÜHR” (postage due).

* The first postage meter was placed into use in 1922. It was a machine locally manufactured by Mr. Max Baum. The Baum machine was not able to adjust to the rapid inflation of 1922-23 and was in use for only a short time only.

* The stamps are grouped according to appearance and by usage:

:: '''A''' - Small experimental franks without TM
:: '''B''' - Pre-WW2 design, horizontal rectangle with points at the sides
:: '''C''' - German occupation
:: '''D''' - Post war provisional stamps
:: '''E''' - Rectangle with double straight-line frame, inscribed “ÖSTERREICH” at top
:: '''F''' - Rectangle with single straight-line frame
:: '''G''' - Open design without outer frame
:: '''H''' - Rectangle with double straight-line frame, inscribed “ÖSTERREICH” above “EUROCENT”
:: '''I''' - Open design without outer frame, inscribed “ÖSTERREICH” above “EUROCENT”
:: '''J''' - Open design without outer frame. With digital data matrix (2d barcode) as part of the stamp
:: '''PO''' - Special stamps for Post Office window service
:: '''PD''' - Special stamps for Postage Due
:: '''PE''' - Special stamps for Bulk Mail
:: '''PV''' - Digital stamps from self-service vending machines

NOTE: Spacing for Francotyp stamps are measured from the center of the date figures to the center of the value figures. Spacing for all other stamps are measured from the right edge of the town mark to the left edge of the frank.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font size=3&gt;NOTE: For specialized information about the meter stamps of Austria, see ''Katalog der osterreichischen Post- und Absenderfreistempel'', by Otto Gleixner, 1990, self-published, Emmering, Germany.

'''NOTES''':
* Sub-type '''a''' is a special form of Postage Due stamp used by the courts in Linz to mail documents with the recipient required to pay the postage.
* Sub-type '''b''' is known by a single example, a cut-out affixed to a blank post card, and is probably a favor proof or an actual proof. It may not have been used on actual mail, or it may represent another Franco meter diverted for court use.

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}
In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 26|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], the Trio, with the help of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]], execute a plan to break in to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts]] vault of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange's]] family to steal a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] belonging to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]].

== Event Details ==

When the Trio is captured and brought to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] sees that they are carrying the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|Sword of Gryffindor]] and panics.  She delays summoning Voldemort, fearing grave consequences if he discovers Harry has the sword.  Bellatrix tortures [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] to discover how they came to possess the sword, which [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] had earlier learned was placed in the Lestrange vault at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts]] for safekeeping.  Harry hears Bellatrix demanding to know if anything else was taken from the vault.  [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]], who is hauled upstairs to corroborate Hermione's story that the sword was &quot;just found&quot;, at Harry's request falsely states that the sword captured with the Trio is really a fake.

After escaping, Harry believes that Bellatrix's reaction was due to her fear that an object entrusted to her vault by Voldemort may have been compromised.  Harry decides to enlist the help of Griphook, a former Gringotts [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblin|goblin]], to penetrate the vault and seize what is probably one of Voldemort's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]].  Griphook, understanding that they do not seek personal gain, grudgingly agrees to get them into the vault if the Trio returns the Goblin-made Sword of Gryffindor to him and the Goblin community.

With Hermione disguised as Bellatrix, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] made to look like a foreign wizard, and Harry with Griphook under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], they set out for Gringotts.  Meeting the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Travers|Travers]] on the way complicates their plans, but with Harry's spells and Griphook's advice they gain access to the vault.

The objects in the vault are enchanted with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Gemino|Gemino]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Flagrante|Flagrante]] and thus multiply and become burning hot when touched.  With great difficulty Harry finds [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Helga Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff's]] Cup, a likely vessel for a Horcrux.  Griphook turns against the Trio, takes possession of the Sword of Gryffindor, and rejoins the bank's Goblins who are responding to the break-in.  

The Trio run for their lives, and in desperation mount a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|dragon]] imprisoned to guard the vaults.  Harry breaks its chains, and with assisting spells from Hermione, the dragon escapes Gringotts with the Trio riding on its back.  Many miles from London, the Trio jump off the dragon into a lake and swim ashore.  Harry has the Cup Horcrux but the Sword is lost.

== Notable Consequences ==

While successful in acquiring the Cup Horcrux, the Trio has lost the Sword of Gryffindor to Griphook.  The sword is one of the few known ways to destroy a Horcrux, and they must now devise a new method for its destruction.

The Trio have also lost the concealment of their mission; the very public break-in to the Lestrange vault lets Voldemort know that Harry is hunting his Horcruxes. Voldemort's fury on hearing of the loss of the Cup Horcrux overflows as he murders the Goblin who brings him the news, and then a number of others who simply happen to be in the room. Harry, through his visions of Voldemort's state of mind, realizes that there is no more time to find a way to destroy the cup Horcrux. The Trio must set out immediately for Hogwarts in the hope of finding the remaining Horcrux, and hope to find a way to destroy it and the Cup Horcrux once they get there. Harry receives confirmation from Voldemort's thoughts that there is a Horcrux concealed at Hogwarts, something he had long believed.

While walking in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]] toward Gringotts, the Trio (and the reader) get a glimpse of the misery Voldemort has imposed on the Wizarding community.  We see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle-born|Muggle-born]] witches and wizards, stripped of their wands, begging for gold.  Others are desperate for news about lost family members, victims of the new regime.  Many shops are boarded up.  Diagon Alley has become a depressing and dark place. 

== Analysis ==

Gringotts is described, from Harry's first day in the Wizarding World, as the safest place to store one's valuables. Despite a break-in to the empty Vault 713 that same day, we never hear of anyone who has actually walked away with anything safeguarded at Gringotts. Therefore, the Trio's plan to steal an object from a high security Gringotts vault is their most outrageous adventure yet. For seven years the Trio has found the need to hatch missions against the Dark Forces, each bolder and more hazardous than before. It would seem that the Trio have once again succeeded in doing something that could not have been imagined before; one wonders what they can do to top this escapade.

The process of persuading Griphook to assist the Trio is of interest as well. We hear that Griphook had left Gringotts due to excessive interference by &quot;wand-bearers&quot;, Voldemort's lieutenants trying to exert some control over the banking system. Despite his being no longer employed by Gringotts, he clearly still feels loyalty towards the bank, and does not wish to violate it. He does eventually agree to help Harry; his rationalization is that, as the Trio seek only one specific item, and that not for personal gain but for the good of the entire Wizarding world, it is not as thieves that they would be entering. He still has some resistance to the idea, however, resistance which is only overcome by the prospect of returning the Sword of Gryffindor to what he feels is its rightful place.

Harry expresses some concerns about the possible loss of the Sword, as that is the only convenient means they have for destroying Horcruxes. Harry and Ron between them determine that they will return the Sword to Griphook once all the Horcruxes are destroyed, but Griphook thwarts that plan by seizing the Sword and departing with it.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

One consequence, unmentioned above, of this action is that news of Harry's invasion of Gringotts and escape on dragonback reaches Hogwarts that same night, before Harry himself does. This serves to invigorate the re-activated [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]], providing a morale boost. While this would normally assist with the rebellion against the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]] control of Hogwarts, Harry himself appears at Hogwarts so soon after the news that any effect the news would have is overshadowed.

In the course of their deception and break-in at Gringotts, Harry uses the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius Curse]] on Travers, twice, and twice on the Gringotts goblin Bogrod.  This is the second time Harry has used an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unforgivable Curses|Unforgivable Curse]], a very serious crime; the first was at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|Battle in the Ministry]] when he used the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|Cruciatus Curse]] against Bellatrix Lestrange.  Harry will also use the Cruciatus Curse on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amycus Carrow|Amycus Carrow]].  It is clearly true that that without the Imperius Curse, the suspicious Bogrod and Travers would have raised the alarm and the mission would have failed at its inception.  However, Harry's desperation to get the Horcrux caused him again to cross a moral threshold from Light to Dark. This is, of course, not the first time; he has used Dark magic before, though previously it was used only in urgent self defence, when it was also being used against him. A theme in the Harry Potter series is the folly of believing in the &quot;Greater Good&quot; at the expense of one's ethical and moral center.  Therefore Harry should be remorseful for going to such extremes in his quest to destroy Voldemort.  If he does feel remorse, however, we are not allowed to see it. In this perspective, Harry is portrayed as the Flawed Hero who occasionally stumbles and loses his purity of heart. It is worth noting, however, that while Harry does use the Cruciatus, Imperius, and Sectumsempra curses, he never kills anyone, even in the heat of the moment. Even in the final battle, when Harry defeats Voldemort, Harry does not cast the killing curse; Voldemort himself does that.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{subpages}}


This wikibook is about defeating your opponent unarmed, using strikes that cause pain, disable or break. Not a perfect manual and definitely not for just sports.

==Training hardiness, guts and pain resistance==
The whole human body is one arsenal of lethal and pain inducting weapons, and we cherish and honor it as one. It just has to be fixed and polished from the softness before one can use it.
The thing is that you hit your own hands, arms and legs so that that area gets hardened and familiar with the feeling (or hit hard things with them). In the end, that feeling can’t even be described as pain. It is great feeling to throw a punch to a wall and know that it hurt more the for bricks than your fist.
Just don’t get it wrong. The thingie isn’t to break your places at the first few hits, to this you should get slowly. A good pace is like when the place under hardening starts hurting a little bit at about ten seconds, then just continue like that as long as you can bear the pain.
If you don’t hit too hard, this should provide you only with minor bruises and nothing less than a good result. Just wait them to heal (almost completely if possible) and do it again.
And when you get to the willpower training, there are some quite simple things to do:

*Putting yourself in danger while training, like fighting dangerous animals and putting sharp things to “punish” you for failure.
*Never using painkillers, no matter the suffering. Pushing yourself to do things normally even in pain.
*Knowingly doing things that hurt.
*Over-exerting yourself, training strength while muscles still aching from last time.

Also, a mighty useful tip for hardening the shins: get a rolling pin. It gets the job done very quickly, just roll over and over your shins until you can't feel a thing anymore. Ding, nerves deadened and a bit of bone hardening as a side effect. Then you can occasionally roll over them *hard* to keep your bones in shape. Why I mentioned only shins is because the other parts of your body are much easier to harden some other way. You can't use rolling pin with two hands to roll over arms...

You should remember that when you do things like cutting yourself, be careful not to dig too deep in yourself. If it is supposed to be training, it should make you killing machine, not killed machine.
The point is simply that you don’t do damage to yourself while hurting yourself. 

Well, at this point I might be seen as a &quot;quite nuts person&quot;. BAM! A fact for you. I *am* quite nuts. Even officially. But does it really matter, as long as you get the efficient training methods and I get the money. Wait... I don't get the money from you reading this. WHERE THE H*** IS MY MONEY?!

...Just kidding, I might be &quot;quite nuts&quot; but I'm still quite an intelligent and reasonable person. Read on.

==Mass increase with weights==
;Landed mode
While in “landed mode” (never mind the clichéish names), you put all the iron on, maxing out your mass and strength training. You should normally be in landed mode while not in combat and sometimes in combat, too. And of course I'm talking about weighted vests and such, not some kind of medieval plates or that kind.
The thingie to wear them in combat is quite simple: the more mass you have, the harder you hit using your whole body. Also, they grant some bonus armor to some locations and when combined with pain resistance training, you should feel almost invincible and be able to throw yourself to enemy without hesitation.
There is another thingie to use them, too. When your muscles need to work more, you should easily slip to finding ways to do it easier. If you train just a simple punch with extra weight, for example, you will notice yourself using your whole body to do the moving. If you always train like this, you’ll probably be using your strength at it’s whole capacity (not meaning using full strength as in pushing yourself to limits) even in normal situations.
Also, you should wear them almost like everyday clothing, so that you totally get used to it. This is also preparations to soaring mode.

A word of warning, though. You shouldn't use any weights below knees, human body isn't designed for joint leverage. With hands this is ok, 'coz you automatically almost always use some muscle to keep the elbow together. When the weights are on, that is.

;Soaring mode
Ever wanted to fly? Well, now it’s almost possible. If you make your mass doubled or at least 1,5 times the normal, when you take them (the weights) off, you are almost flying. If you use the weights for a week as almost normal clothing, you should feel the results. the longer you do, the more weight you should put on so that you can fly even higher.
The thingie here should be quite clear. If not, you can just imagine being able to control your own gravity. Flying, eh?

==Adrenaline dietary==
*Adrenal glands.
B- and C-vitamins.
Those ones I’ve confirmed to be the ones that adrenal glands need most. You can get good amount of B-vitamins by eating much meat and potatoes, while the latter gives you also some C-vitamins. It actually is one of best C-vitamin sources, not counting most berries in. And, well, meat also gives you proteins, keeping your muscle mass together.
Liquorice is a more interesting thing then. The more you eat it, the more you produce adrenaline and other important things from adrenal glands. And it even raises the “constitution” of them, making them last longer and better anyways. So it is beneficial to adrenal glands all the possible ways.
There is a strong but, though. Liquorice also raises your blood pressure, and if you eat it more than about half a kilo every day, it will affect your health (not in a good way), and be it about ten to twenty times that, it might even prove fatal. (These are the imaginary lines though, I've never tested...)

If you wonder why there is such part as adrenaline dietary in a martial arts article, I can, by all means, tell you. Adrenaline itself affects your reaction time and reactions are the bigger half of fighting ability (usually).
The other half is psychology, technique and actual experience. And of course strength. And that is the other thing adrenal glands enhance.
And that is why you eat meat, potatoes and liquorice.

Oh, and maybe I should mention also that too much adrenaline might cause panic attacks. Good luck for balancing the amount. ^^

This is good if you really want to do all of that, but it is not a requirement. Good martial arts depends on focus and you may not be able to keep your focus with a huge shot of adrenaline.

==Training==

If that little voice in your head tells you that you are at your limits, you probably are. Ignore it and continue training. Once you break through that barrier, especialy when running, you get what is called your &quot;second wind&quot; and you feel like all the pain is gone. Once you can get to this point you will be able to get the full affect of the training. 


===Neck-, body- and leg muscles===
Yes, you can train all these with one quite simple move:
First, you need something solid and about length your foot at height.
Lay down with your forehead on that object and hands behind your back. (Or you can use your two fists as the object. Might train a bit different sections of your body, could be a good idea to use both methods.)
Then straighten your body so that your toes / balls of the feet are only thing touching the floor.
If this is too hard (as it should be in the beginning), you can simply put your hands down like doing push ups and lift some of the weight with them. Try to put as little weight as possible to the arms.
This should help your whole body to strengthen and harden. When you can do this with hands behind your back, congratulations. Give yourself a treat, especially if you are a big guy. And especially if you used ironwear as you’ve been told before.

Also, you should do sit-ups to strengthen your core. Those without anything to keep your feet down work better (of course *you* keep them still down) as they train your back as well (if you want to do longer sessions of training, I'd say that you should keep the feet down with some kind of extra weight or something).

===Rooting-training===
Take a wide riding pose and stay like that as long as possible.
Stand with feet about two times the length of your shoulders apart and point feet just a bit inwards. And of course legs bended a bit. Push your chest and hips a bit forwards and relax. Imagine being on desert and sinking into a pool of quicksand.

You should train this as much as possible so that you can quite effortlessly stand like this for at least an hour.

===Fingers===
At fullest strength you can just do push-ups with fingers, but to start with, you could do this: Kneel down and simply push the ground with your fingers. Also, you should carry things around with fingertips.
Good to do is to do push-ups with “claws” (look into basic techniques -section)

===Feet and stamina===
To begin with, always move with the balls of the feet. Your calf muscle is your most powerful stamina drainer, so when you train it as much as possible, you can go on battlefield bouncing like a kangaroo without a hint of fatigue. This muscle also helps you getting your leg off the ground fast when kicking. When combined with root training and using weights, you'll become a jumping machine like those masters in old gong fu movies...

Use small amount of weights so that you can do training for as long time as possible. That way your body very gets easily familiar with the movement, it reduces the risk of getting yourself unusable and there's no really need to do warm-ups.

===Legs===
Rooting is a great way to train your legs, but to truly max out the power (without any gym equipment), you run. And I'm not talking about the ordinary running here, it's more a stamina thingie (and duh, I hate running)...

This one: you drop yourself halfway down and run crouched. And add as much weight as possible 
(in form of a backpack full of heavy stuff, for example). The thingie here is to make short, powerful dashes stepping on your balls of the feet. Having your knees bent as much as possible, this is the most powerful way of training that leg strength you use in making every punch.

Remember this: all strength originates from your root, the place that touches the ground. Or wall or whatever.

===Shadow ground-boxing===
Lay on your back, crouch so that only it touches floor and lean a bit left first. Then you go like, one simultaneous kick/punch forwards with right leg and fist. Next lean backwards (still on your left side of back) and do the same to upwards. Then lean instantly on your right side of back and do the same on left leg/fist. I sometimes also do variations of attacks on the move, just to spice it up a bit. Some simple like elbow strikes and such.

Trains stomach muscles very well, trains some back, gets you a good sense of balance (the leaning on different directions without touching floor with hands or legs), gets you to feeling of attacking from ground and works on your basic attacks.

It's good to imagine the targets you're going to strike at, even though it might seem to be just air. Shadow boxing ain't just for swinging around randomly, you know. Imagine how your opponent attacks you and react accordingly. Imagine how *you* would attack on a ground opponent.

===Snake-strech===
First put your arms on your sides so that there's a straight line between your elbows, and relax the rest of your arms so that your hands just hang downwards. Then, using your muscles, you bend them first down and then backwards, keeping the elbows in a straight line. If you got a helper or two, they can bend it (it is quite hard to bend with just you muscles first) to just stretch them.

So basically, you put your hands up (with straight line between elbows) and try to do a 360* rotation around the elbows. Of course, you twist your shoulders in the process, too. That's a part of the training. Probably takes quite a while before you can do such a freaky thing, the whole 360*.

The idea of this stretch is not that you'd use very much attacks that require this kind of bending, but there are two points which make this useful: First and foremost, it trains your shoulder muscles. Or whatever you want to call them. When you train like this for a month or two, the difference on your arm speed should be clearly noticeable. Well, at least if you're not trained before.
Second, if someone were to try to give you pain by twisting your arms, they'll find it quite impossible. Or at least hard.

Of course this is also useful if you want to freak out your friends by showing them your freaky arms that strecth &quot;almost infinitely&quot;.

==Strength usage==

*One quite common tip for using your strength wisely, and brief explanation why is this:
Relaxation. You might think that while “concentrating on speed”, your might lose at power as a payment of speed. Think again.
You can put it simply with physics: Power equals mass x speed. Mass is practically the amount of weight your muscle lifts. When your punch gains some speed, it is physically impossible to lose power if your fist doesn’t suddenly turn into marshmallow or something like that. (Of course we’re talking about the speed upon impact here.)
Upon impact, you should push it forward with all your might, but if you’re not intending to stop your punch, still you shouldn’t lose the relaxation.
The thing here is that if you make any tension at the muscles of the opposite side, it draws you hand that way (and that most definitely slows down your fist). If you first relax your whole arm and then punch, you are using only the needed muscles and thus making the full power with minimum unnecessary strength used. Of course this needs practicing, also, for you can't have a whole second for relaxing at every punch, be it sparring or an actual fight.


*Maxing the power of a strike:

1) Use your whole body. This is one thing every martial artist should already know, but for those who are not yet one of them, here it comes: The very power of your punch comes from legs. If you'd study physics, you'd probably mutter something half-abstract about slowness of mass or whatnot. True, you can throw a punch with only your arms, but the thingie here is maxing the power. Once again, the very power of you punches is in your legs.
That is why you are rooted when throwing punches (not speaking about &quot;superman&quot; punches and such, of course). You use your every muscle from arms to calf, making a little spin with every punch.

2) Drop your knees. The more you weight, the more power this adds. It really is ridiculous amount of unused strength if you don't drop at least a little. This should be done at the same pace as the punch itself (well duh of course). And do not drop yourself to the ground, just a little bit downwards. Should be easy enough with a bit timing training.

So when you punch, you kind of do a little (might be almost unnoticeable) corkscrew movement downwards.

Also, remembering that while push-ups do good for your punching power, you should be more concerned with sit-ups and leg conditioning.

==General tips and tactics to fighting==
The thing here is simply that you use your brain while fighting. It might be quite good idea to forget your “honor” and use whatever means needed to win, especially when there is several opponents.

*When you see an opportunity to do something dirty, do not hesitate to take it. For example, if there is sand on ground, why not use it?
*Take advantage of the playground. If you can drive your opponent to some kind of trap-like environmental object like bushes, tables or anything that might hinder his movement and/or ability, do it. Having the position control trained properly gives you a huge advantage.
*Do attacks of opportunity. When your enemy is clearly going to attack from a certain direction or with a certain technique, don’t just wait for that hit to come and defend it. It is better to stop it before he gets to execute his move. Like if he’s going for a hammer-kick, you just kick him in that leg before it drops or charge forwards and push him down while his balance is off.
*Do as much as possible the way your opponent isn’t expecting.
*Train your every single move so that they get into your backbone as reflexes. That way you won’t need to ‘search’ them from your brain and thus will your reaction speed improve.
*Never give your back to the enemy if you’ven’t trained to move yourself so fast they can’t take any opportunities on that. When surrounded, try to put as many as you can to your sides instead.
*Always remember to breath. Also, learn to use you’re breath as a powerizer to your movement (a quick exhale at right time).
*Avoid crossing your legs for more than a moment. Maintain a low stance so that your balance is good.
*You should avoid moving back to dodge, if you move to the sides / front while parrying or dodging, you’ll be the one getting situation.
*Search yourself for places that hurt easily and use them in others. There’s a pressure point under ear, for example.
*If you are under attack on street, opponent probably has some kind of weapon. Always expect to get cut (or hurt in some other way, whatever the weapon) so that you don't panic when it comes to that. Focus on survival and avoiding serious injuries, not on pain.

==Ground fighting against a standing opponent==

For starters, you need strong and staminaful middle body. So do sit-ups and sit straight. When you go down, make sure you land safely, squat down immediately you notice you can't keep your balance. When fighting against masses, do everything to not fall. When pitted against a single opponent and when trained properly, this position might even be favorable for you. Not one single guy expects you to go down on purpose and fight from there.

The word is turtle. An upside-down turtle. When you land, if you can't immediately spring up somehow, lay down on your back and kinda crouch so that only that back touches the ground. The most defensive and aggressive stance at the same time. Easy to kick from, easy to grab from and even moving isn't so hard when you get the trick to it.

So, &quot;what can I do from this position?&quot;, you ask. The first thing, you defend. Imagine a situation where there is two opponents, for example. It is practically the same thing as having your back against wall or otherwise both on the same side. Just that there is only one opponent. So, to speak a bit more clearly, your feet are the only target to your opponent. And your feet are a weapon. So basically the only option is parried blows. Or, if the opponent is fool enough, he might come down charging at you, only to be kicked and thrown over you.

Secondly, you attack. You can do almost every kick from this position as you can do standing. You just direct them a bit differently. To do a sweep, for example, you just turn to your side and kick from &quot;down&quot; to &quot;up&quot;. Targeting knees. And you can do thrusting kicks as easily as if you were standing. Maybe even more easily. I personally prefer using the edge of foot when throwing thrust kicks from ground. Maybe you find your own favorite, maybe not. Most definitely not if you don't search for it, so get to ground and start testing.

And, this is a great training method, too. Trains you in almost every possible way you need to train to make your kicks and punches count.

==Basic techiques==
Claws: one section towards your fingertips from knuckles. You could call them ‘first finger knuckles’, but since it is easier and goes within the dragon spirit, I’ll call them claws.

===Hand / arm strikes===

;Basic punching
Your basic punch. Yes, the same nice oldie you'll encounter in karate for example. And probably in at least 90% of other martial arts, too. Can be used as defending means against most swing-like attacks (like wing slash from this art). Usually good to combine with a fast forward movement, be it defending or not. The &quot;power maxing&quot; tips apply to this strike, too (of course).

As simple as it sounds, most people still do the punching wrong. So here's a few very basic things that apply to every punch. So that you hurt the opponent more than yourself. First, the wrist. If it is just slightly off the straightness, you're going to sprain it when hitting hard. Second, the thumb. When you clench your fist, the thumb *is not* inside the fist. You put it *below* the fist. Well, that last one might be a slightly rarer mistake, but even more important as that.

And legs. Legs, legs, legs. And once again, legs. If you punch and your body follows, you are doing something very wrong. Well, at least if you just try to get as much power into your punch as possible. You start the punch from your legs, transfer the power upwards through hips, abs, chest and shoulders to the fist. &quot;Getting the power that a whip uses&quot;.


Now for the &quot;soft&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; punch. This is for the &quot;soft&quot; punch, the one which will &quot;non-forcibly&quot; disable the opponent. Good for self defence.

* The whole punch starts with relaxation. Relaxation. Smells quite fishy, now doesn't it? Well, the point is (as already described at 'strength usage' section) that this way you get the maximum speed and strength, your fist hits its target with far greater velocity. Only place you shoud keep tensed up before hitting is your wrist.

&quot;So I shouldn't clench my fist at all, then?&quot;

Wrong. The point is that you train so that you can clench it just before the impact, and even then just slightly. This, of course, is a part of the soft punch. This is the best way to disable the opponent without breaking anything in you and maybe a bit less in him. The thingie here is just that it causes almost as much pain, so you still might want to use the &quot;hard&quot; punch if the attacker seems to be high or something. Going berserk, if you will.


And then the &quot;hard&quot; punch. This is the one you use to break things and people. Now then comes the vizualisation into quite important role. When you vizualise something, your body is quite a bit more eager to move that way.

So, first you clench your fist as hard as you can. Imagine it weighting a ton (don't still go tensing your upper arm muscles too much) and that ton of pressure-packed iron going *through* the target. It is very important that you kinda &quot;see&quot; the fist going through and continuing its movement when it hits the area. Actually, don't even think that there is anything in its way, just focus your strength on the fist and hit just as if you were shadow boxing. Straight through the opponent's face and skull.


Punching takes many forms. Jabs, straights, haymakers. Those three are in line for speed-to-strength with usually the normal straight the most useful. Also, there is a bundle of more advanced punches which are very useful, used in most Chinese arts for example. Hitting with fist in a bit different angle, using a bit different part of fist to hit, using a bit different movement. These are covered from this onwards.


;Claw swing
You put your hand into fist, thumb at the side and hit with claws. Swinging, not thrusting, as if you were knocking a door. This is your standard defending strike for straight punches and also your standard paindoer.
This is best means to hit bone, as mass behind it cant be so big that it’d hurt your fingers, you can even do this to stone walls and it doesn't feel even like pain. This, however, does hurt the receiving one, especially when done to bone or “hard” muscle.
This could be a quite confusing “punch” if you do it with almost straight line.

With this, for the same reason it doesn't hurt you, you can't really break anything effectively. Can inflict small bruises at most. A very good strike to &quot;toy&quot; with your opponent, when you don't want to really hurt someone but to just show your superiority and that his attack is in vain. Just make sure that you *have* that superiority and that his attack *is* in vain...


;Crushing wheel
A mid to close range punch with really no hard variation, making even a minimal tension lose most of its power. Not too weak punch even then, but as with most of more advanced punching techniques, relaxation is the most important part for getting power. When you learn this effectively, you probably get much more power to every other punch also.

When using the wheel punch, the fist *and* the wrist are both completely relaxed. Noting here that relaxation being not the same thing as no strength, just using it just as much the fist actually floats in the air. You'll know the feeling when you reach it.

The movement: First, the part you hit with is the bottom three knuckles. Second, the motion is much like throwing a fishing rod, just a little bit more straight. The hit comes like pushing the opponent down-backwards. The perfect punch will be about half a second in contact, like sticking into the inside of the target.

Like the name implies, this punch is a good one to throw quite rapidly using both hands, like a wheel that tries to crush and climb over the roadblock. With the sticking inside, there should be almost always one fist in contact. When done with a Ki feeling and contacting into the chest, the opponent should feel quite sick after the first few and collapse quite quickly. If you have trained in this enough.

Notice that this does not really use that much physical strength, rather just placing the fists into opponent (with high speed) and pushing slightly. Imagining you hands sinking into the target and grabbing and pulling the innards downwards.


;Wing slash / Elbow strike
You simply swing your arm towards target, hitting with the area from elbow to claws. Makes quite a variety of attacks since you can swing from and to practically any direction. Could be wise to put your hand into fist to avoid fingers *crunch*ing in wrong place.
This would be best to the side of the neck, jaw or to the temple (side of the forehead) as means to knockout.

As for the elbow (it actually is included in this), a &quot;short elbow&quot; is when you simply hit from short range with your &quot;forward&quot; arm (a kind of jab of elbows) and a &quot;long elbow&quot; when you have a gap between yourself and the opponent and you're going to close it while hitting. Both include of course the &quot;elbow uppercut&quot; and whatever names people have given for the same strike from different angles.

The counters and counter-counters for wing slash are quite much similar to the ones for claw swing, except for the elbow strikes. When a short elbow is incoming, you simply dodge backwards, assuming you are not back against wall. As for the long elbow, you'd do best by parrying it with a palm strike (hitting not the elbow, but a bit towards hand from there). Then it's just the thing that who gets to perform the next hit. In whichever position you are, I'd recommend using palm (as it's target areas are so free you don't have to really think when hitting) or a short elbow (just a bit slower, but has a rather big amount of more power if you want to break).


;Palm strikes
Now this is something more original. When doing these, you simply hit with your palm. This is quite safe attack for you, because with this, injuring your hand is practically impossible. This is quite easily done at basic level, taking only a minute or two to learn. At this level, it's better to hit with a &quot;hard palm&quot;, with its &quot;heel&quot;. But to use this really effectively, for truly devastating effects... You'll have to spend hours and hours training with Ki and heavy bag.
To use this effectively is to move into trapping range (close range, where normally grapples are done). When comparing to fist or claw attack, this has a significantly shorter range. While this might be a hindrance in normal situations, this also means that in very close range, your hand has more freedom to get some speed into the strike. This is very useful when in trapping range, as you can very easily get your opponent's jaw for example.
Good targets for this kind of attack in very close range are jaw from sides (for knocking uncoscious), thoracic diapraghm (a muscle below lungs, hitting it will get breath out of basically anyone), chin from below and shoulders. Hitting face with this is also a good choice, as the shock from it will give you quite much time to do something else. Something nasty.

The more advanced versions of this are covered in &quot;Using ki as a weapon&quot;.


;Wrist bash
When hardened properly, this is quite potential place to strike with. You simply hit with top of your wrist. This should be both a fast and a heavy strike at the same time (with a short reach, though).

This is quite much too quick to be countered.

Example targets / opportunities:
*After an elbow strike, usually oppositewards. Usually it's quite good to aim to jaw (from sides), chin (as an upward strike) or nose or neck (from up).
*Chin. After a hit to solar plexus / thoracic diaphragm / stomach
*Chin / jaw. After a parry on a straight punch.
*Jaw (or nose if available). After a hit (probably palm) to shoulder.

===Kicks===

;Stomp
A weird kick, but you should train this to use as your basic technique. Why? Because this is the most hard-assed kick out there. Of those you can easily perform. Fast and powerful. Not accurate at all.
This kick is performed as you turn your back to the enemy. You lower your stance a bit, lean on your back leg and make it the front one. Then just raise your leg, bounce a bit backwards (the former forwards) and kick backwards (the former forwards). This is the more powerful version, not so fast. To do this fast, skip the bouncing and let yourself go a bit farther from the opponent as you kick. The edge is your heel.
This, again, is those things that aren't going to be countered. Except for the more powerful version. To counter that, just leap a bit backwards (because he's going to come your way), grab his leg and throw.

This is best performed on low areas of body. The higher you go, so goes the amount of training needed. Because usually when hitting higher parts of the body, it's just so much easier to use normal side kick.


;Twist kick
You start with raising your knee to the height of your waist and then twist yourself so that you hit your opponent's side instead of front. Fast, not powerful, but does confuse your enemy.


;Snap kick
You simply raise your knee and then thrust with your ball of foot or your footgear. If target is high enough (like head and so), you might end up hitting with heel and / or not thrusting but swinging upwards. This applies to the kick to the balls also.


;Roundhouse kick
Nothing special yet even more important. Your most basic crushing kick. Hitting with shin or back of the foot.

First you take velocity by pushing your upper body into direction you're kicking in, with the leg you're going to use to kick. At the same time you rotate the not-kicking leg's foot by the ball of the feet so that the heel comes as far forwards as possible. The direction of rotation should be obvious, at least if you try it out. Then you let the leg follow up with explosive speed, from your side to the target.

If you'ven't hardened the shin properly, it will break very easily.


;Hammer / axe / overhead kick
You bring your heel down to your opponent from upwards.

Hammer: Raising the leg up from left or right side of the opponent. Targeting usually shoulders or head.

Axe: After a frontal kick to chin. Targeting usually chest (yeah, assuming that he was bent backwards from the first kick).

Overhand: After a handspring or somersault. Targeting usually shoulders or head.

===Position control===

;Stopper-kick
Could be at &quot;kicks&quot;, but it fits here better.
You simply put your foot on the opponent's chest and push. The more you’ve done the rooting-training, the longer distance the opponent should fly. You can spice it with morphing it into a side kick while pushing. Adds strength.
If your foot isn’t contacted with the opponent’s chest when you start the push, this also makes quite a potential kick otherwise.
To counter this, just grab the foot before the push and push back.
As a counter-counter, push harder than the other.
Or as a counter requiring bit more speed, you could throw the attacker from that leg. Quite impossible to counter-counter with only one leg at ground. If you're a mutant, that's a different thing then.


;Shield bash
Used mostly at trapping range.
Imagine there is a shield strapped on your arm and push with it. To do this without actually having that shield does not differ any way. The “correct” way of doing this is when you use mostly your leg and shoulder muscles to do the push.
If you hit with it instead of pushing with it, you should build some muscle mass into that section of arm and harden it so that it hurts your opponent more than you.
As a counter, grab the arm and throw as he pushes you.
To counter this, you can do about the same as with the claw thrust.

==Parrying / dodging / countering==
===Strikes and kicks===

The first thing you need to learn to deflect, is the haymaker. The very basic &quot;brute punch&quot;. So, when that giant is charcing down on you with the fist coming first, you need to stay calm. Basics. Do not panic, do not just flinch backwards and cover.
The very first of basics, always forwards. The less there is space in between, the less force the ordinary guy can get into the punch.

You have three choices: dive under the fist to his side, step forwards so that you're in front of his face and his arm over your shoulder, or parry and punch or take a grapple. This works basically against every strike or kick, with maybe a little variation on some. Dive, step forwards or parry. Sometimes a combination of two. And always defend and strike simultaneously, in the same movement.


So, to the point. Now that you know the basics. The haymaker. The easiest and fastest response is definitely stepping forward and parrying it. And now that you've done that, you have quite a wide repertoire of weapons to use in close range. The best in this situation being perhaps elbow. Or if you don't want to knock him cold for some odd reason, you can easily knock him just down by simply putting your leg behind his and pushing.

As the second thing comes in the physiology of arm. Think about the forearm as a lever or a handle and the elbow as it's support. Pushing this lever sideways causes the victim to go into ground or you to go into his backside. Depending on the result you want. And it works very well on legs, too. This also is quite basics on self defence / fighting.

So, to do it in a situation like a haymaker punch (thrown with right hand), you step forwards diving a bit down and right. At the same time you use your left arm to pin his punch and against your neck. At this point, you are moving back almost the same way you came in, this time bringing the punching arm with you. Let it slide a bit so that you use your neck as a support to twist him by forearm. Then step forwards-left, twisting the arm to outside of him, maybe placing a leg behind his. Done right, even a bear is on ground. And the whole time you can use your right hand to do whatever you want. Probably to defend against his lefty.


Then comes in the roundhouse kick. Againg, step in. This is especially true regarding roundhouse kick since it loses even more of its strength because the lack of space. And then you'll notice he's got only one leg on ground. Your win.

Alternatively, you could just take the kick and push down by the knee. Makes the opponent go down with back given to you. Your win. Again, while doing this, throw as much punch you can at the same time.

Also an option is to just take a half-step in, diving against his leg and spiking it with your elbow.

==Ki==
===What is Ki===
For sceptics and those not experienced in martial arts: read on at least for amusement of this &quot;mystical bulls**t&quot;. The following is my version of that thingie, try not to be upset if you actually believed in Ki being a magical power running through a master's veins or something.

So, what is Ki and what to do with it. As a contrary to common (sarcastic) beliefs, you can *not* shoot fancy laser beams with Ki and you do *not* need to be especially talented or born in ninja family to use it. And, Actually it even isn't any mystical energy flowing in your system. Those are just concepts to grasp the imagination thingie.

Ki is an inner strength. A way of using imagination to boost your subconscious self-confidence of succeeding and a way of using completely relaxed strength to achieve what you imagined. A way to see and reason clearly, blocking the constant chatter in your mind, and a way of getting the body do the minor adjustments in muscles that matter. Mostly, and especially first, with imagination.

So, what to do with it? You could try this as your first thing. Have someone push you when you stand normally. Do it again, this time imagining a steel ball inside you, hanging off your shoulders and located around your waist. It is really hard to push it any way, but imagine pushing it downwards with all your might. Try taking the push now. Feel the difference? Try pushing it upwards or backwards and take another push. The more you've trained yourself in martial arts, the clearer the feeling should be. In time, you can do this without seemingly moving at all. And that's why people call it mystical energy. Whee, a magical power in your grasp, how's that feeling? :D

So yes, knockouts without touch are a myth. Ki isn't an actual energy to transfer to other. And to hear a master saying &quot;it doesn't work on non-believers&quot; takes off the last piece of plausibility about that. So please, let's not talk about magic anymore.

When you're over the shock about Ki actually being a quite mundane thingie, you could try out an unbendable arm. It's a Ki trick that is very easy to grasp and most people can use it without any kind of former experience.

First, put out your arm and tension it fully, as if trying to make it stone. Have someone bend it (of course the way it should naturally go) with both hands and with constantly increasing force. When it bends, swap places and try it other way too, testing the feeling.

Then relax the arm, shake it a little bit. Get the arm up again, this time using just as much strength you need to keep it there. Reach out, as if trying to grab a tree that's a hundred miles away... Keep your elbow just a bit bended. This time just ignore the bender, just focusing on trying to reach that tree, just trying to get your arm miles long. Have him try again. Feel the difference? That power is Ki. Your inner strength, power of relaxation.


===How to use Ki===
To actually use ki in a situation is not as simple as doing those few &quot;tricks&quot;. Yes, it is the same Ki feeling you use these abilities with but it needs a huge amount of concentration to maintain the feeling in actual combat. Sparring also, but even more in a situation your health or life is threatened. Imagine an angry gangster with a knife charging at you and try relaxing... I think you know what I mean. But that is essential for survival. Not only you can think clearly when relaxed, but also have a whole new level of strength and speed available. If you can use it, that is.

So, I'm now going to tell you how to. First, you need training. If you're doing martial arts just for everyday self defence and have a lot more activities to do, I'd recommend you to stop at the basic level of Ki. This needs time and dedication to reach advanced feats of &quot;Ki masters&quot;, taking it from a few months to years even in active training, depending on a person. If you me ask what I can do, I'd answer &quot;I'm at intermediate level, I just learned harm people with it&quot;.

Indeed, it is not very hard to harm unaware people with it, but using it as a weapon is a whole new thing. I think I'm learning quite fast, and yet still I have spent almost half a year training on it. This needs time.

So, to reach out and grasp the basics. The very first thing is rooting. I told you before how to train in rooting, and that is the very first key helping on your journey to Ki. I'd say you've grasped the basics when you can easily stand half an hour in that wide riding pose. It took me about three weeks to get a flash how to do it relaxed and then it just like was a whole lot easier. At the time I was doing it only as a leg strengthening exercise. Now it seems I spend about an hour a day just to get the Ki feeling.

So, I could try to explain you how to make it easier to grasp the feeling. Make it easier, I said. It cannot really be taught over, but a &quot;sensei&quot; (Ha, I like calling myself a sensei, that's teacher in English... ^^) can show you a way to experience it.

First get into the pose and be there as long as you feel comfortable. It might be ten minutes, it might be half minute, but just as long you can without getting sweaty and trembling. Then just rest about five minutes, just plain resting.

Then, get into the pose again. This time, rapidly decrease the strength you use to stay in that position so that your legs almost give in. Just when you start to drop, do this again. Continue as long as you can, and you'll probably notice that it is longer than before. So you'll be doing a slight &quot;bouncing&quot; here the whole time. At the first few times you train this way, you could get a day in between to rest, depending on how you feel. After a week or so, you'll notice a difference in time you can stand on the warm-up. After two or three weeks, the difference probably takes a radical leap, as doing this is now a relaxed muscle power. And congatulations. you've just learned to use Ki to strengthen yourself. I still do the exercise after a half year, every day. It keeps getting longer time and some day I'll probably just end up doing it a whole day when I'm bored...

Anyways, when you can do this, you just start doing the normal strength building exercises, using the same kind of passive-active relaxation, which I call the Ki feeling. Soon you'll quite unconsciously do your every movement the same way, drastically increasing your natural reaction time and strength. And this is the phase I've been continuing for about half year before I deemed myself ready to continue on to other abilities. And I suggest you do the same.

      <comment>/* The Demand Side */ don't need that sub-category</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
{{DISPLAYTITLE:&lt;span style=&quot;display:block;text-align:center;font-size:300%;font-style:italic;line-height:1em;&quot;&gt;Strategy for Information Markets&lt;/span&gt;}}
This is a textbook intended for upper-level business economics courses. The focus of the text is primarily on the economics of information goods and markets facilitated by information technology, particularly with respect to the Internet.
== [[/Background|Background]] ==
This should likely be material at the end, rather than the beginning, but we can see. I'm putting the self-assessment quiz here. It should include other similar material which isn't strictly part of the course, but is important background.

== [[/Introduction/]] ==

== The Demand Side ==
Demand is created by establishing a want and linking it to a sense of need. Information, in general, is necessary as people need to be informed in order to make correct choices. Otherwise, all digital content is based on an artificial sense of want. Beyond sharing of information and ease of communication, there is not much that the rise of digital information networks has brought to the human society. In fact, the need for information sharing and easy communication were the two reasons the Internet was originally created. People are independent on these networks in order to satisfy those two needs. Digital information networks were only a leap forward in the optimization of old distribution and communication technologies. Most of these advances resulted from the rise of the digital age, in applying computing power to old analog models. Example: As globalization raises the need for faster distribution of information and communication, improvements in those areas will be needed.

== Competition and strategy ==
Providing information services or digital goods has costs, not only in the final offer, but in the maintenance of all the infrastructure that is required to keep the market open. All participants have to pay to be present, there are the costs for local infrastructure, energy and in access to the medium.

Surprisingly, many of the participants will offer free services to each other. This, allied with the easy access to public domain works, freely licensed digital goods and works under copyright infringement corrodes the old physical market shares that depended on the digitization of creations and procedures. The concept of a distinct separation between consumers and producers starts to disappear. This presents a difficult challenge to information goods providers to individuals who want to enter the market, not only of commercial viability but of visibility and relevance. How to make money? In this chapter we will examine revenue.

The Internet was never intended to be a commercial zone. However, even with the impact of the Internet on world commerce and markets, people still argue that it should not be a commercial zone. Today the concept of network has gone global; as the computer becomes smaller and energy requirements decrease all things will ultimately become interconnected.

== Style guide ==
Cleared, so it doesn't get confused wtih [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Updated_style_guide|the updated style guide]], below. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 20:55, 18 November 2010 (UTC)

== Computer games topics ==

Based on [[User:TDang/Classlist#Groups_and_projects|this grouping]] there are three groups interested in writing about computer games. A member of one of the groups (the &quot;Online game economies&quot; group) contacted me saying they were uncertain of how to cover it, or whether there would be conflict with another computer game group. Here's a few thoughts I have. If you are in one of the three groups, you should feel free to add your own thoughts.
* First, the group focusing on PlayStation 3 probably won't have a problem conflicting with the other groups. It might be worthwhile to keep an eye on what other groups are doing, anyway. Your group's goal should be to do a helpful case study of the PlayStation 3, it's history, competition, and Sony's strategies. You're being specific to illustrate more general points.
* The group covering &quot;Multiplayer games&quot; has an extremely broad topic. I expect you'll have to narrow it down, and there are many ways you could do that. I'll wait for your first set of contributions before trying to steer you one way or another.
* The group who were going to cover &quot;online game economies&quot;--depending on what the multiplayer game group concentrates on, there's room for you to develop this idea if you want. There has been interest from both academic economists and game developers in the in-game economies of [[w:MMO]]'s. This can be interesting in its own right, but can also extend to interest in how to have in-game economies and real-world economies interact, with several game companies making their money from free-to-play models. Again, this might wind up overlapping with the other group, but perhaps not. It is also possible to change your topic if you think that's necessary. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 21:33, 17 September 2010 (UTC)

== topics to add ==

Here's some thoughts on topics the book does not yet have, but could be worthwhile additions.
* '''virality''' What does it mean, how can it be used as a strategy, is it internet-specific, etc.?
* '''collectability''' Would Pokemon and such things be as popular as they are without the artificial constraints making for &quot;rare&quot; cards?
* '''network externalities and fads'''
* '''view source and standards''' [http://www.shirky.com/writings/view_source.html], [http://infrequently.org/2010/01/view-source-is-good-discuss/]
* '''open-source as a strategy''' versus open-ness [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 21:13, 7 October 2010 (UTC)

* '''empirical approaches''' This is a potentially large area, and it's not clear if it should be treated as a singular &quot;topic&quot; or addressed in various places.
** On the one hand, e-commerce allows for collection of a great deal of data, and even controlled experiments.
** On the other hand, is it realistic to try to identify empirically where is critical mass for a product?

* It will be awkward to handle well, but some discussion of the place of pornography on the internet would probably be important for completeness. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 18:13, 8 October 2010 (UTC)

* '''labor market''' There are a number of aspects of this
** Modern telecommunications allows remote working as never was possible previously.
** Overlapping with open-source, there are a fair number of skilled knowledge workers who are willing to work for free. (This is with lots of caveats, just a note for the moment.)
** I'm sure there's plenty of other labor issues
* '''information spillover''' This partly ties into labor, since information spillover relates to labor moving between companies, laregly an issue in mitigating the competitive advantage of learning economies.
* '''risk''' For a lot of information goods, there's a high risk. For drugs, the development process can be very expensive, when the drug might not be effective, approaved, or successful. For movies, music, and books often one can't be sure what will be a hit or a flop. How does that risk affect strategies?
* '''contracting''' How are contracts structured for the production information goods? [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 16:18, 14 October 2010 (UTC)

== positive and negative feedback ==

In the long run, does spending time on &quot;positive and negative feedback&quot; ''explicitly'' benefit understanding? It's implicit in network externalities in any case. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 22:01, 8 October 2010 (UTC)

== Overall organization ==

This may mean a thematic change for the book to more &quot;Economics of ...&quot; than &quot;Strategy for...&quot;, but I think the core economic models/ideas and the strategies based on those ideas should be made more distinct. For example, first there needs to be a model of network externalities, and ''after that model is mostly complete'', then it can go into things like expectations management and penetration pricing. Being that this is economics, and the strategies are endogenous to the models, these divisions won't be completely clear-cut, but I think making those divisions as neatly as possible is a good goal. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 16:05, 14 October 2010 (UTC)

Possible new overall structure:
* demand-side
** Network externalities
** two-sided markets
** discrete goods
** durable goods
** lock-in
** price discrimination
** other pricing strategies
* supply side-fixed costs
** innovation
*** intellectual property
*** spillovers
*** open source
*** creative destruction
** sunk costs (and risks of it being unknown how sunk a cost might be)
** economies of scope (in fixed costs)
* supply side-variable costs
** low marginal cost of information goods
** information technology and variable costs for non-information goods
* distribution
** business models for distribution/sales given internet: online uactions, etc.
** competition with increased information
* internet-specific businesses
** search
** online games
** social networking
* other topics
** advertising
[[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 17:03, 2 November 2010 (UTC)

== innovation ==

A worthwhile section for this book would be on innovation economics. There is theory and empirical research behind it. It could also help form an organizational structure for various intellectual property / piracy / information spillovers / open-source development and so forth. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 16:42, 26 October 2010 (UTC)

== Updated style guide ==

These are style guidelines we should follow uniformly throughout the book. If there is a style guideline you think would be helpful, please propose it here also. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 20:54, 18 November 2010 (UTC)

''Cleared to not conflict with updated style guide below'' [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TDang|contribs]]) 02:25, 29 April 2012 (UTC)

== Overall organization 2 ==

Again, coming at overall organization. I think that starting with the cost/innovation side instead of the demand side might make sense, since it keeps feeling like the cost side jumps into the demand-side discussion.

Still want to orient this a bit more towards economics and a bit less toward strategy. Somewhere in-between, like industrial organization, so more &quot;Economics of ...&quot; than &quot;Strategy for...&quot;.

Possible new overall structure:
* supply side
** innovation
*** intellectual property
**** simple monopoly models
**** rent, quasi-rent
**** piracy, DRM
**** fair use, idea ecosystem
*** non-IP motivations for innovation
*** spillovers
*** open source
*** creative destruction
** sunk costs (and risks of it being unknown how sunk a cost might be)
** learning economies
** economies of scope
** low marginal cost of information goods
** information technology and variable costs for non-information goods
** natural monopoly
** Difficulty of applying typical strategies/analysis
* demand-side
** Network externalities
*** two-sided markets
**** advertising
** discrete goods
** durable goods
** lock-in
** price discrimination
** other pricing strategies
* distribution
** business models for distribution/sales given internet: online uactions, etc.
** competition with increased information
* internet-specific businesses
** search
** online games
** social networking
* other topics

== splitting book ==

[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=1914750 This note] suggests splitting the book. I lean against, but should revisit the idea after some re-organization. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TDang|contribs]]) 22:19, 4 October 2011 (UTC)

:I feel your pain, a monolithic text permits a greater vision and a hinger capacity to manage the structure. But consider the readers (ultimately the ones you are writing the book for) try to some inkling on where you are going with it and close the &quot;finished&quot; sections in their own pages. You can also create a monolithic version with those pages with transclusions, that has helped me in the past, however now there is a stricter limit on the number of possible transclusions.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 02:36, 5 October 2011 (UTC)
:PS: See for example what I have done in [[C++ Programming/Chapters/C++]].  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 02:39, 5 October 2011 (UTC)

::Thanks, this is tricky. I'm hoping for a textbook for a one, or maybe two-semester course, so I see it as wholistic, and I'm hoping that the &quot;splitting&quot; sentiment is due to the current confusion in what's here rather than truly needed splitting. But... I'll see. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TDang|contribs]]) 17:18, 5 October 2011 (UTC)

== network society ==

It's probably a bit far-out for this text, but worth thinking about: [[Communication_Theory/Network_Society]]. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TDang|contribs]]) 17:13, 12 October 2011 (UTC)

== DVD region codes ==

Be sure to talk about [[w:DVD region code|DVD region code]] in regards to price discrimination. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TDang|contribs]]) 08:57, 20 October 2011 (UTC)

== Another book ==

[[Lentis]] is a big Wikibook project which is likely to have some material which could be used here. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TDang|contribs]]) 21:20, 29 November 2011 (UTC)

== Did some restructuring ==
Feel free to alter any of my changes. I also added the need to cover data mining, and explain how the Internet was turned into a market and by that fact regulations started to creep into it...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 22:56, 18 January 2012 (UTC)

Has the class project terminated? Will anyone attempt to turn the separated pages into a consistent book project ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 01:18, 19 January 2012 (UTC)

:The class project went on hiatus, but has re-started. The goal is still a good textbook, but we may get there in baby steps. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TDang|contribs]]) 23:37, 20 January 2012 (UTC)

::Thanks see my next thread below...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 12:13, 24 January 2012 (UTC)

== Class project ==
Can anyone please stick a notice at the top of the page, regarding this class project especially the user that is heading the project and the expected duration and objectives. This would be extremely useful information to fellow wikibookians. Thanks.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 12:13, 24 January 2012 (UTC)
:Hopefully what I've added above the TOC is helpful. There's more material on possible organization, etc in various topic threads above. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TDang|contribs]]) 19:35, 31 January 2012 (UTC)

* [[Lentis]] (from above)
* [[Intellectual Property and the Internet]] (newly added, and recently created by importing stuff from Wikipedia, January 2012)

== zimiaol ==

This website is very useful to learn the strategy for information markets, but the overall arrangement is little bit mess, branches are not clearly enough, I think rather than followed by a paragraph after the title , it would be better if they could add some spot points.

== review thoughts April 2012 ==

While I'm reviewing material, here are some all-purpose thoughts--not directed at any particular section.
=== Copying material from elsewhere ===
Don't copy material from elsewhere! (Except in very circumstances you communicate with me, which only one student has done so far.) It's academic dishonestly and/or copyright violation. If you have copied material from elsewhere and I haven't yet discovered it, make sure to:
# Go back and remove the material you copied
# Tell me about it.
This is extremely important. If you goofed and copied material from somewhere else, there's time to correct that (although having done it will possibly impact your grade). If you goofed and copied material and it's still there next week, then it will be a major problem. If I discover something like that after grades are reported, I will be willing to file the change-of-grade paperwork to correct the grade.

=== Style guide ===
Here's mostly a repeat of earlier notes on style, but with some minor updating
# For most things, rather than Wikipedia, let's keep it within the book. This should be more book-like (something you'd imagine being printed on paper) and less hypertext. So, if you want to link to something extra (another section withing the book, or the [[Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Glossary|glossary]]) do so, but skip the links to Wikipedia for most purposes.
# '''You''' Only use the second-person form of address '''you''' if it's strictly referring to the reader/student. In other cases, we should use ''one could'' rather than ''you could'' or specify an actor ''the business could'' rather than ''you could'', since we don't want to assume the reader is in the place of a customer, business, analyst, or whatever.
# '''internet''' Don't capitalize &quot;internet&quot;. This is an evolving standard, different sources use different standards. If you're quoting another source and they capitalize it, leave their capitalization in place. Otherwise, for us the &quot;internet&quot; is lowercase.
# '''Emphasizing keywords''' This standard ''might'' change as we see how it works out. To emphasize a key word or phrase (something which you might call a &quot;vocabulary word&quot; for the given section), we should '''bold''' that word/phrase ''the first time it appears only''. Otherwise, the word/phrase should receive standard treatment like any other words, not being capitalized or otherwise emphasized. (Additionally, you might want to link keywords to the [[Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Glossary|glossary]].)
# Only chapter (also called &quot;module&quot; or &quot;page&quot;) titles should have full capitalization. Sections within a module should have sentence capitalization.
# Formatting section headers: No bold or italic, use the Wikibooks code for sections.
# There should be an intro section--just don't give the first section a heading. The introduction should be an introduction-appeal to reader enough to make them want to read it and give a feeling for what's coming.

===References===
# Check to make sure you're using good references.
## Wikipedia, about.com, and (unless someone convinces me otherwise) tutor2u '''are not''' good references.
## If there's something you like from Wikipedia, you can follow that through Wikipedia's references to a better reference, and then use that better reference (if you can verify it yourself). A similar strategy will often work for blog postings, which are not reliable themselves but will often link through to something which is a good reference.
## Some web sites can be good references, but try to be sure. A major news outlet will be a good source for many things. There are university-sponsored educational web sites which are reputable. In some fields, there may be specialty web sites which are reputable (Gamasutra for videogames is a good one). Be careful what you use.
## Using web sites from a company selling a product (which includes consulting services) should be very limited. They can be good sources of some information about their products, but if you're using a lot of information from there it might mean you're going astray from writing objective material appropriate for the book. Other material from company sites can be pure advertising, which should be avoided.
## Online sources are preferable to paper sources only if good online sources can be found. It's very nice to be able to follow a reference right away through the web, so that's a huge advantage. Sadly, there are still a lot of areas where there is not good, freely-accessible online material. You may need to use books for this. For economics material, a textbook can be a good source.
# Please link references using Wikibooks reference tools. This should includes author, title, etc. If it's a book, include a page number or a range of page numbers in the citation. (See [[User:TDang/tips_on_citations]].)
# Try to use &quot;inline references&quot; so that the reader can know which part of the page connects to which reference. If you're referencing a book, include the relevant page number(s).

===Objectivity===
We're going for a textbook, which, for good or ill, means some amount of &quot;dryness&quot;. Lively writing is good, but it should be somewhat objective and removed from what you're writing about.

One area where I've noticed this can be a challenge is in writing about a company or product (or class of product), that the writing will tend to become promotional, as if the writer is working for the company in question, trying to convince the reader that X is &quot;the next big thing&quot; or otherwise just fantastic. That's not appropriate for a textbook. The writing should be analytical.

== just things I'm noticing ==

(If you're an ECON 452 student in Spring 2012, you really don't have to worry about what I'm writing here. This is for myself or any other future editors. Of course, if you're interested or want to be a future editor yourself, knock yourself out.)

* [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Non-IP_approaches_to_innovation&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=2320849 This edit] removed some text for not having an adequate reference. I bet a reference for that notion can be found, and this idea put back. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TDang|contribs]]) 20:49, 4 May 2012 (UTC)
* [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Search_engine_business_models&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=2321347 This edit] same as above [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TDang|contribs]]) 21:37, 4 May 2012 (UTC)
* [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Search_engine_business_models&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=2321198 This edit] replaced a popular-media article with an academic article. I think that academic article is already referenced alsewhere and leaving the popular article in also would be good.

Thank you for your interest in Sustainable Business - a handbook for starting a business.

This wikibook is based around '''[[/The business plan/]]''', which is made ready as a template for you to use to plan your own business. We have incorporated sustainability planning through out. To help you prepare your business plan, we have authored a range of supporting '''[[/Booklets/]]'''. These are small informative booklets that give some advice, examples or background thinking for the relevant sections of the business plan. If you prefer reading print, you can [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Collections/Sustainable_Business download a PDF or order a bound book from PediaPress]. Before you start, we strongly suggest you read the Booklet, '''[[/Sustainable business practice/]]'''. This will help you to understand the sustainability references throughout the business plan more clearly.

Sustainable Business - being in business for the long-term.

Sustainable Business - getting started in a small business and staying in business.

This section is for describing who you are, what your business idea is, how you will go about your business, and what the market sees in your business.

==About you==

Perhaps subtitled &quot;getting to know you&quot; this section starts with a brief curriculum vitae of you the entrepreneur. this gives the reader - whether it be the a financier, your staff, the community or your markets, an insight into who you are, what your capabilities, and areas you will need support.  

'''A general summary'''

Try to make it interesting, relevant and reasonably brief.

'''Position'''

*What degrees/diplomas are held.
*What professional bodies are belonged to

'''Skills'''

For example: (include verifiable stories or references)

*Managing people (if your business involves hiring staff)
*Ability to take on new ideas
*Overcoming difficulty
*Sales  
*What other start-ups have you been involved in and what role did you play.

;Ask somebody

Ask people who know you well and who will be honest with you, what they think your strengths and weaknesses are. It is great to know what we are good at but in business it is more important to know what we are not good at. 

== About the business ==

;Summary
Come back to this section after you have completed everything else in this booklet. Summarise your responses to each point in booklet to give the reader o your business plan, an overview of what it contains.

;What type of business is it?
State what sort of business you are planning first:
*Not for profit
*Manufacturing
*Leisure and tourism
*Wholesale and Retail
*Services
and then describe what your business will do, or what it will be, or describe the product or service.

;Is there a market?

;How will the business work?

;Does anyone else do this, and how?

;What do you need?

;What is the background to the business?
A narrative description to the background to how this business formed.

;Check points
A flow chart that guides the user through a self analysis of the idea, resulting in actions.

Refer to flow chart in the Introduction. Page 2 of the NZTE text [http://www.nzte.govt.nz/get-ready-to-export/Starting-a-business/Documents/Starting-a-business-guide.pdf Starting a Business] - this chart should be redesigned to simplify and fit the idea.

==About the market==
Demonstrate what you know about the market for your business. Then call on your principles to deliver a value proposition to that market.

More needed on how to analyse and define a market...

== The principles of the business ==

You will establish a number of operating principles for your business. When you set about deciding on your methods for operating your business, you will consider how each method helps you achieve and maintain each of your principles.   

For example, one of your principles might be ''maintain a healthy work/life balance''. A method for doing business in line with that principle might be that you and your workers maintain reasonable work hours with good holidays and friends and family events. Your business might decide not to operate in overtime, or help coordinate childcare and healthcare.

Another example might be that your business will ''produce no waste''. Methods might be a reduction, reuse and recycle process, where you try to purchase goods when needed rather than in bulk, and from other businesses that generate little to no waste themselves. You might use those products in such a way so as to capture or reduce the waste you would otherwise generate. 

Your methods will always need to include outcome evaluations so you can be sure they are helping you maintain your principles. If you can successfully operate your business with methods that maintain your principles, then your principles become the value proposition your business can make to its market and community.  

So what are the principles in which you will do business? Here are some examples of principles that may assist you in developing your own.

# Word an operating principle for each category that will guide decisions toward solutions to the problems and issues
===For Example===

====A retail business====
====A tourism business====
====A service business====
====A not for profit====
====An accommodation business====
====A manufacturing business====

==The methods for the business==

Refer to the booklet [[Sustainable Business/The business plan|Methods of business]] and list all the methods you will use in preparing for and operating your business. Remember to use your principles in guiding your decisions about methods.

==The value proposition==

Based on your principles for doing business try writing a value proposition to those with interests in your business. After you have worked through the initial market and SWOT analysis, come back here and rework your value propostion. The objective is to have a good balance between your business principles and your market's demands and expectations.

;The value proposition

What value does your new venture provide to its customers? 
How do you plan to set up your venture to ensure this value is delivered to each customer.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_value_proposition

The sustainable business takes this concept and adds layers (a matrix??). 

'''The value you provide'''

What value do you provide to your customers. 

*For example it may be to provide the latest in fashion garments at an affordable price.

*Another example might be a tourism operator who seeks to provide an experience that is memorable and has a minimal carbon footprint.

What is required is to get-to-know your customer because assumptions in marketing are based on our own backgrounds which may not be similar to our customers.  

later sections will help develop a structured approach understanding a businesses customers and how to deliver value to them.

money value 

to community

;How is this value delivered?

A summary of the Methods. '''Leave this for later'''.

==SWOT==
The purpose of the SWOT analysis is to help guide you in the thinking of your business plan. This is your first attempt to assess whether your business idea is sensible and whether you have the skills and finance to set you on your way to ''self employment''. SWOT stands for....

;Strengths
List the things that you consider the business already has. These can be certain skills that the people involved in your business have, the location your business will operate in.

;Weaknesses
Listing the weaknesses in your business is probably the most important step. If you know them you can take steps to address them. Weaknesses can include skills shortages in the people who are involved in the business, difficult marketing conditions, or long development periods. List all the weaknesses you can see, describe how they will affect your business, and what steps you will need to take to address them.

;Opportunities
What opportunities are there that your business may benefit from. They could be changes in laws and regulations, a new market niche, the closure of a competitor, a technological innovation. List any opportunities you can see, describe how they affect your business, and outline what you might do to take advantage of each opportunity.

;Threats
These may be competitors, economic changes, new laws and regulations, not enough capital to keep the business running through down periods. List the treats you can see,  describe how they will affect your business, and outline how you will manage these threats.</text>

This should not just be an exercise in ticking boxes but is a principles and methods based report where preset monitoring points are addressed in sentences.  The HC would be done with the SBN co-ordinator.

Consider the output measures that should be included in each ''Methods'' booklet.

[http://live.isitesoftware.co.nz/sanford/documents/sdr/Sustainable_Development_Report_-_published_17_December_2008.pdf Sanford TBL reporting] 

The end of a financial year brings with it the opportunity to look back at what happened.  One of the very difficult things for the small business person to do is to extricate themselves from their day-to-day role and review their business. Some term this ''working on the business'' not working in the busienss.  

In the world of bigger business this is the role played by directors at monthly or bimonthly board meetings.

When managers are involved in this process it is not uncommon that they go away somewhere where there are no phones and place thenmselves in a different environment.  For the small businessperson this role has been filled by there accountant or by a business coach.  One of the chalanges for the small entrepeneur of future will be finding somebody able to help them work on their business in a holistic way.  The traditional training of accountants and business coaches does not encompass the wider issues we have been dealing with.

review business performance

as already mentioned review sales weekly and have a more thorough review each month. 

what would we do difefrently

could we do better?

How does the business fit with my personal life?

If yes are you prepared to tolerate this for another 12 months? 2 years? how many years?

If the business(s) is/are unreasonably encroaching on your life then:

[[File:Booklet sustainable business practice.jpg|thumb|400px|]]

This booklet aims to help you approach the question of how to develop sustainable practices in your business. It focuses on practical steps from understanding sustainability in terms of business, looking at examples and scenarios, defining a set of guiding principles, and applying them into a business plan. We have avoided overly theoretical discussion about sustainability, recognising that it is a young and developing area in its own right, focusing instead on the practical steps a business person can consider and take now.

= What is Sustainability? =
Sustainability does not have an agreed definition. Specifically when used in business, the term is either: 

# Weak sustainability: an expansion over the financial bottom line where the business considers environmental and social sustainability as well. Many people refer to this as the triple bottom line. Other times, the term is used simply for environmental responsibility. 
# Strong sustainability: a whole new approach to doing business, with every consideration made in the business is to contribute toward a sustainable society.

In general, [[w:Sustainability|sustainability]] means the ''capacity to endure''. However, for the purposes of this book, and the practical considerations of the business planner, we have brought together a set of principles for sustainability. Every time the term sustainability is used in this book, it refers to these principles, NOT simply the capacity to endure. The principles can be applied using the strong or weak models of sustainability. 

It should be noted that these principles have been identified solely for the purposes of defining and applying sustainability. They do not necessarily cover all the principles you would be using for planning your business. See the [[Sustainable Business/What's important to you|What's important to you]] for further information about identifying other principles and values for your business.

= Some sustainability myths =
i) ''Sustainability is about being an environmental activist or about philanthropy and I can’t afford to give away all the profit of my business''

Some businesses have a misconception about what sustainability actually is, if they believe it is about being a staunch environmentalist who gets on their high horse and tells other people how they should live their life; then they are mistaken. Or if the business thinks that sustainability is about philanthropy and they must give away all of their profits in order to be seen as being sustainable, then, once again, they are mistaken. A focus on philanthropy leads to ineffective business programs that fail to achieve very dramatic benefits for the community or the company. The fact is that a company has far greater resources to tap for the sake of social good than its earnings before income tax. Philanthropy can be an effective component of the sustainability puzzle, but it is just one piece. 

ii) ''The sustainable option is going to be more expensive than the alternatives'' 

Some businesses hesitate to consider environmental policies because they assume sustainability is going to cost an arm and a leg and be way more expensive than other options. While this is true in some cases (renewable energy, for example, can sometimes be very pricey), there are plenty of examples where making responsible business decisions can cost little or nothing. In many cases, an initial cost increase is followed by a substantial and ongoing cost saving. The best initiatives to drive employee engagement and happiness don't cost a cent; they're just about treating people differently. The same goes for customer service. Community involvement can often be costless as well. And sometimes, even philanthropy can be free, for example, if you work to encourage and facilitate donations by others (such as, at the point of sale), all of these people focused actions are important considerations of a holistic sustainable business practice. 
Also, many initiatives can even create savings, such as a reduction in the overall energy and resources that you consume. This can cause you to reduce your expenses. Examples of this include going paperless, finding ways to reduce/ reuse/ recycle materials in operations and production, facilitating green commuting options for your workforce (car-sharing, public transport, telecommuting). Sustainability is ultimately about making more efficient use of resources, and cutting waste not only for the good of the earth and society, but it is good business practice. So, if you are strategic about how you do it, your business can save money. 

iii)	''Sustainability is about re-cycling materials, therefore other than installing recycling bins into our offices, sustainability doesn’t affect my business'' 

Some businesses think that because they are not manufacturing aluminium/ plastic/ steel products (which can be recycled or made from recyclable materials) that sustainability does not affect them. Yes, recycling is part of the sustainability puzzle, but it could be considered as the ‘ambulance at the bottom of the cliff scenario’ (i.e., it is a step too late). There is so much more to sustainability that affects every company. Consider, for example: employee engagement; your suppliers and supply chain; operational efficiency; resource consumption and waste; packaging and facility design; volunteerism? Governance? Ethics codes? Customer service? The list goes on… sustainability is ultimately about ‘adding value’ to your businesses with people, planet and good business decisions in mind. 

iv)	''If we use green-coloured packaging and the words ‘eco’ or ‘organic’ in our product, then we can sell our product as being ‘green’'' 

Do not underestimate your customers’ critical thinking skills and ability to smell “Greenwash”. Just because your new product comes in fancy re-cycled packaging or uses the latest buzzwords, it doesn't make it environmentally or socially responsible and your customers will know this. Expect them to read labels, ask questions about materials and use the Internet to compare your product with competitors. If you don't have anything substantially environmentally or socially responsible to say, don't bother trying to greenwash. (A good example of greenwash could be the latest ‘fad’ of ‘eco’ bottled-water companies!) 

v)	''We are already doing as much as we can in our company, but it is not making a difference to sales'' 

Although your customer can smell greenwash, do not overestimate how much time and energy they have to research and understand your sustainable initiatives. Your customers are not stupid, but they also have lives and they don't have the time and energy to spend hours analyzing your carbon footprint and your products’ lifecycle. If you don’t actively market and thoughtfully explain your company’s legitimate initiatives, then no one is going to know about them. Don’t assume that because your business is adding value, people are just going to naturally find out about it.
 
vi) ''Sustainability seems so complex and hard to measure, how can we hope to manage it'' 

There is an old saying in business that goes “You can't manage what you can't measure”, this is correct but measuring sustainability is becoming more and more possible (see section Measuring sustainable business practice). Many businesses, especially smaller companies, overestimate the cost and difficulty involved in measuring their performance. But it's often easier than they think. A few simple processes and habits can routinely provide a great deal of useful information. A lot of the data is already right at their fingertips. So the old saying is correct, collecting this information will help a company to manage its sustainable practice. The real issue, however, is not measurement, but comparability. How do we compare a company that reduces pollution with a company that provides community education opportunities? That issue will never be solved; it is a moral issue that individuals must judge for themselves. But it hardly hinders, and certainly encourages, the measurement and reporting of sustainability performance. 
Please note: These myth busters are adapted from two Internet sites: www.openforum.com and www.provictus.ca.

= Why develop sustainable business practice? =

There are two main reasons why businesses adopt sustainable business practice:
# because the business owner believes it is a responsible and ethical thing to do, or 
# because there is a perceived business advantage.

The [http://www.nzbcsd.org.nz/vision.asp New Zealand Business Council for Sustainable Development] (NZBCSD) suggests that the following are advantages of applying sustainable business practice:
* Be more efficient and competitive
* Engage in responsible entrepreneurship
* Increase their financial return and reduce risk for shareholders
* Attract and retain employees
* Improve customer sales and loyalty
* Grow supplier commitment
* Strengthen community relations
* Contribute to environmental sustainability

;The market
Consider the rapidly growing group of consumers looking to buy sustainable solutions. Many businesses are now looking to see how they can include this group in their target market by providing environmentally or socially superior products to their competitors. This can be seen in almost every industry. For example most banks have been through an advertising campaign in recent years showing how they contribute positively toward the environment or their local community. 

This group are changing other consumers behaviors as well - and quickly. Look how rapidly plastic bags have become an optional item, when only recently almost every retail outlet didn't question the use of a plastic bag to package a customer's shopping. 

For more information about this trend, look into [http://www.lohas.com/ LOHAS] (people wanting to live a life of health and sustainability), or see http://www.moxie.co.nz/_site/insight.php

;Stakeholder engagement
The reason this is important to sustainable business practice is that trust, which is a critical element for any business, requires mutual understanding. If your stakeholders understand what you are trying to do and you understand what is important to them, then your ability to ensure both your needs and expectations are met increases. Without this understanding, mistakes can be made which can have negative consequences on the business. 

'''Example''': A new printing shop opens in a neighbouring suburb and starts to offer recycled paper as the standard printing paper. They are able to offer their printing at the same price. They are advertising the recycled paper option as a point of difference in their business. Their advertising appears to be working. As the owner of the existing printing shop, you have noticed your sales starting to drop and you are surprised that your customers were interested in using recycled paper. If you had a better understanding of what was important to the local market, you may also have been offering the recycled paper option. For more information about what a stakeholder is, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)

== Return to Sender eco coffins ==

'''[http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/sus-dev/case-study-sustainable-eco-coffins-aug08/index.html Return to Sender eco-coffins]''' manufactures coffins for the New Zealand funeral industry. In designing the coffins (the product), the owner considered:
* how to minimise materials used (through the use of light materials such as plywood)
* how to minimise toxicity used in the coffins (through the use of natural materials where possible such as sheepskin mattresses, non toxic glue and no metals that could produce toxins when burnt)
* how to minimise waste (considering raw material dimensions in the design of the product such as the size of a sheet of plywood)
* how to offset carbon emissions (through contributing to tree planting schemes)
* how to make it easy for others to make sustainable choices (such as offering a Foundation that accepts bequeths for social and environmental product design)
* how to ensure as many jobs as possible were created in New Zealand
* how to donate to the local community
* how to influence others (such as through raising awareness in media campaigns about toxins in caskets)

== Formway Furniture ==
The following case study was conducted by the [http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/sus-dev/case-study-sustainable-design-at-formway-furniture-feb07/case-study-sustainable-design-at-formway-furniture-feb07.html New Zealand Ministry for the Environment].

'''[http://www.formway.com/ Formway Furniture]''' represents an important example of how corporate commitment, strategic planning and phased practical implementation can deliver sustainable design solutions in the office furniture sector.

The Wellington-based company – which exports to the world – has been proactively evolving its sustainable design methods for several years and has recently begun a more comprehensive sustainability program.

Formway has come a long way since its modest beginnings as an engineering company making steel furniture for the New Zealand market in the 1950s. Today, it is an international company with over 200 employees, showrooms in Auckland, Wellington, Sydney and Melbourne, and manufacturing plants in both New Zealand and Australia. 

All production of goods has an environmental impact and office furniture is no exception. The production process is materials intensive drawing on both natural and synthetic resources from wood-based products and metals through to plastics and textiles. Through the smarter and more responsible specification of all material types, Formway is striving to cut emissions, reduce solid wastes as well as eliminate and/or significantly minimise the presence of potentially hazardous substances in products and processes.

At Formway environmental performance and sustainability are important issues from the top down:

:''&quot;At Formway we continually look for ways we fulfil our mission to be a leading company in environmental performance. Formway is a design-led company and we firmly believe that excellent design and making sustainable decisions go hand in hand.&quot;'' Alan Buckner – CEO, Formway

In particular, the company has a reputation for innovative, people focused, elegant design solutions. For more than 10 years Formway has enjoyed strong growth in both products and distribution. This has included significant expansion into Australia, vertical development of its distribution channels and entry into new markets through the design and launch of ranges of work stations, high performance seating, and soft seating and storage products.

;A five-pronged approach

Formway’s environmental strategy is being implemented in five environmental management programs:

# Product Design – Eco Innovation. Formway design teams are constantly searching for new materials and technologies to ensure future products are at the leading edge of commercial environmental product design.
# Supply Chain Management. Formway recognises that its suppliers’ efforts are vital to deliver a sustainable production system, accordingly supplier environmental requirements and continuous improvement actions are part of routine supplier dialog. 
# Operations – Environmental Management Systems. Formway has joined the Landcare Research EnviroSmart scheme to achieve EnviroMark certification for its EMS system.
# Product Stewardship – End-of-life focus. Formway’s first priority is to ensure its furniture is designed to give many years of service without being made redundant through obsolescence or fashion change. However, work is also ongoing to develop a robust and practical end-of-life management approach that maximises environmental and economic value.
# Stakeholder Communications. Sustainability communications are undertaken both within the company and with all other environmental stakeholders, particularly architects and designers.

Formway has employed Jake McLaren, a former UK EcoDesign specialist, to develop and implement the new program.

:''&quot;The first necessity for making ‘green’ products a commercial reality is a real desire and enthusiasm from the management level to make products and services more sustainable. Marketers, designers and engineers need to be encouraged to look for opportunities that add value to a company and benefit the environment simultaneously.&quot;'' Jake McLaren - Environmental Manager, Formway

The programme includes a range of associated measures and services such as:

* evidence for GreenStar tool rating for specific Formway products
* product eco-declarations and third party environmental product certifications
* peer review of Life Cycle Assessment studies completed by a sponsored PhD studentship
* product stewardship services available on request for interested clients and projects.

:''&quot;Our environmental management program are owned and implemented by teams in design, production, supply chain management and end-of-life. Collectively these people share their environmental learning, develop new tools, techniques and best practice.&quot;'' Keith Hilligan - Chief Financial Officer, Formway

The environmental improvements Formway has made across its major product ranges are mostly available at standard cost not ‘optioned-up’ premium cost add-ons. For example, in Australia, it uses MDF board rated EO for reduced formaldehyde content and sourced from certified sustainable forests in Victoria. This is now the standard material for all Formway workstations in Australia.
The Life Chair – exemplary and influential

The Life Chair is one of Formway’s most influential and commercially successful products in recent years. Formway personnel collaborated with Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and Product Ecology to develop a detailed EcoDesign brief which aimed to eliminate and/or minimise a range of life-cycle environmental impacts. Specific design considerations covered areas such as:

# environmentally oriented materials selection
# design to facilitate cleaner production
# design for durability and extended product life
# design for reupholstery, refurbishment and reuse
# design for disassembly and recycling.

The following summary outlines several key Design for Sustainability outcomes related to the Life Chair.

* the Life Chair is designed for reupholstery – the seat and back sub-assemblies and upholstery toppers can both be easily removed and replaced
* the chair contains 30 percent recycled content (combined post-consumer and post-industrial) and is over 90 percent recyclable
* user instructions are integrated into the chair’s physical design ie, under the seat
* the Life Chair is approximately 23 percent and 65 percent lighter than its two main competitors, reflecting advanced material efficiencies and high strength to weight ratios
* it has approximately 18 percent fewer components than its primary competitor
* materials-efficient ‘3D knit-back suspension fabric’ eliminates the need for a ‘materials-intensive’ upholstered foam back or solid plastic frame
* most of the chair’s adhesives have been replaced with snap fits, hinge pins or spring clips
* plastic parts have in-mould labels to help quickly identify material types and enable easier/faster sorting, separation and recycling. No PVC is specified
* the Life Chair is Greenguard certified to verify low off-gassing during use.

;Getting the balance right

The ongoing and future challenge for Formway as it bolsters its sustainability program is to get the balance right between qualitative and quantitative aims, objectives and outcomes. In other words, the need to create products and services that are ecologically responsible, economically necessary, socially desirable and culturally acceptable. Getting such a balance right is what makes a company and its products ‘sustainable’ as opposed to merely ‘environmentally-improved ’.

:''&quot;Our designers are always looking for ways to make environmental product breakthroughs, for example really exciting progress is being made in the development of biopolymers. These materials are getting close to the stage of replacing petrochemical polymers in high performance applications.&quot;'' Bob Stewart – Design Manager, Formway

The journey for Formway is likely to become more interesting and positive over the next few years as major external pressures and drivers demand much higher levels of environmental performance from the commercial furniture sector. Formway sees ahead several specific opportunities that will help focus further attention on sustainable design and ‘greener’ furniture over the next five years, for example the development of the New Zealand Building Council GreenStar Interiors tool and publication of the Environmental Choice New Zealand ecolabel for furniture. Formway has experience working with Australian clients and the existing Australian GreenStar tool, and looks forward to the development of similar tools in New Zealand to assist the local architecture and design community.

There is little doubt that opportunities will continue to emerge, and Formway will continue to use them as a catalyst for innovation and good design, now and into the near future:

:''&quot;Everything we do at Formway has an environmental consideration, from product design and right through the supply chain. Creating a sustainable future is a key component of our design philosophy and company values.&quot;'' Alan Buckner – CEO, Formway

Formway is grateful for the support of the Foundation for Research Science and Technology, in assisting with the development of the Formway environmental program.

= Scenarios of sustainable business practice =

A local hairdressing salon is looking for a new accounting firm to prepare their tax return. There are three chartered accountants and the salon has asked each of them to provide:
* A quote for completing the tax return
* A description of how the accountant contributes positively toward the local community and environment, and
* What makes them a good employer 

The salon is going to choose their accountant once they have considered their responses to these points.

;Making sustainable choices easy
The tile company that supplies many of the plumbers in town is trying to discourage paper use and so is providing an incentive for its customers to receive their accounts electronically. A prompt payment/electronic bill discount is being offered for those customers who both pay on time and opt for their bills to be sent electronically. It also reduces the costs of the tile company by significantly reducing postage and paper use.

;The wider community
The local cafe sources local organic produce where possible. However, bananas can't be sourced locally and the cafe has found a company called [http://allgoodbananas.co.nz/ All Good Bananas] that import bananas that have been grown under fair trade conditions, guaranteeing the grower and their family a fair deal.

;Managing sustainability risk
A breakfast food manufacturer is wanting to expand its market share with children's cereals. Some of the most popular breakfast cereals in the children's market contain synthetic food colouring. Although it is allowed to be used in food in New Zealand, in other countries it has been banned because of a possible link to cancer. The breakfast food manufacturer has decided to leave out the synthetic colouring and where necessary use natural food colours just in case the link is ever proven.

;A plumber's commitment
The new plumber has decided he will not be spending any money on sustainability (environmental or social) initiatives until he is turning over $1100 per week. At that point he has decided to donate half a day per month to the local Woman's Refuge for plumbing related work they need doing. Although this has no cash cost, he has decided to match his time with a $30 donation per month. And when he takes on his first employee, he will double the businesses time and financial commitment. 

The impact of this decision on his financial documents, is nil until month 6, when he expects to be at $1100 turnover. At this point $30 per month will be included as donations in his expenses column. As he expects to employ his first plumber during year 2, the $30 will double to $60 at the same time.

= Principles for sustainable business =

There are two types of principles; operational and strategic. Operational principles are practical – they address the question of what we do and how we do business on a day to day basis. The strategic principles tend to be used as guidance in setting the direction of the business. They will be used to help decide how things are done within the business. 
 
== Operational Principles ==

* '''Good Employer''' – the organisation is committed to employee satisfaction, development and well-being. The organisation, from the most senior management level display and model fairness and equity in all aspects of employee relations and show no tolerance for discrimination, bullying or harassment. Workplaces are safe and healthy and employees are encouraged to provide input and participate.

* '''Environmental responsibility''' – the organisation is respectful of environmental limits and operates in an environmentally efficient way in the design and delivery of its products/services. For example material/resource use is minimised, products are designed and manufactured considering the full life cycle of the materials and waste products. Environmental technology is invested in and/or used for example using solar panels to generate electricity. 

* '''Community contribution and fairness''' – the organisation contributes to making the communities in which it operates better places to live and do business (for example, sourcing materials locally) and employees are encouraged to become involved in achieving this goal. Often this will be at a local level, but there may also be opportunities to apply this at the national and/or global level. All employees demonstrate honesty and fairness when dealing with stakeholders. Although not often applicable in small business, where relevant, working in partnership with Maori to empower Maori in decisions that affect them.

* '''Influencing others''' – the organisation actively encourages others such as suppliers, customers and its employees to improve their own sustainability performance. For instance making it easy for customers to recycle the product or foreign material manufacturers implement internationally accepted labour standards to ensure forced or child labour is not used in the manufacture of materials or parts.

== Strategic Principles ==

* '''Integration of sustainability into the organisation''' – sustainability is a business priority and is reflected in all aspects of the organisation, including business processes (such as decision making, vision, performance management) to ensure that decisions are made with their sustainability effects in mind. There is clear evidence of management commitment to sustainability.

* '''Minimising risk and maximising opportunity''' – Addressing risks and uncertainty when making choices and taking a precautionary approach when making decisions that may cause serious or irreversible damage. Applying this principle using the strong sustainability lense would go further to propose that lack of full scientific certainty is not a reason for postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation. 

* '''Transparency and accountability''' – the organisation is transparent and accountable about its performance in matters that are important to others. 

* '''Meeting tomorrows needs with innovation (Integrated and long term thinking)''' – Considering the long term (inter generational) implications of all decisions. Seeking solutions that are mutually reinforcing rather than accepting that a gain in one area will necessarily be achieved at the expense of another. For instance recycling waste material, saves dollars by reducing rubbish levies.

= Applying principles and practices =

As you follow the business plan template included in this book, you will see references to these principles. That is the way sustainability has been integrated into the business plan. In addition, examples are offered as to how the principles could be applied (using the weak model of sustainability unless otherwise stated). 

As a small business owner, you may not want to know anything more about how a definition of sustainability has been arrived at. However, for those that are interested, it would be wrong to not point out that there are some strong areas of disagreement about whether approaches to sustainability should be strong or weak. Proponents of weak sustainability tend to argue that strong sustainability is not a practical option - that it would be too hard for an individual business to take a strong approach. 

Proponents of strong sustainability argue that taking a weak approach can in fact be detrimental to a sustainable future and that there are some significant conflicts between how we organise ourselves as a society and what is valued vs what is required to have a sustainable future for future generations. For example the conflict between sustainable development and continued economic growth. The basis of this argument is that the ecosystem cannot support continued economic growth with its associated pressures on the natural environment. This position has not been reflected explicitly in the principles, however, is its considered in the strong examples of sustainability.

'''Integration of sustainability''' is a principle and is discussed in the principle section above. But it is so important that we thought we would add a little more about it here. If sustainability is a business priority then it is reflected in all aspects of the organisation, to ensure that decisions are made with their sustainability effects in mind. 

In addition, there should be clear evidence of management commitment to sustainability. 

Below are some prompts to help you check whether sustainability is integrated into your business. Not all of these need to be considered, but as the business grows, this can serve as a reminder for additional processes to consider: 
* What norms or policies exist to ensure integration? For instance a volunteering policy (providing employees with a certain amount of time off work to volunteer), environmental policy/goals, fair trade policy etc
* What certification systems are available for your business (such as an environmental management system such as Enviro-mark, an industry specific standard such as Forest Stewardship Council
* What membership organisations are available to join to increase our business' learning and profile in sustainability (eg The Sustainable Business Network, or the New Zealand Business Council for Sustainable Development - see &quot;Further links and resources&quot; section)
* How do your staff know sustainability is important to the business and how are they rewarded for integrating it into their roles?
* What are the sustainability goals of the organisation? Do the stakeholders know what the goals are? Is the actual performance being measured? How does the actual performance compare with the goals and how is the business communicating its performance to its stakeholders? 
* How does the business encourage its supply chain (eg suppliers, customers) to make sustainable choices and/or improve their sustainability performance?

;Applying strong sustainable business practice
Strong sustainability can best be defined by comparing it to weak (incremental) sustainability. Incremental sustainability is used as an expansion (over the financial bottom line) to the breadth of what business considers important. Sometimes this includes ethical, environmental and community responsibility as well as being a good employer. Other times, it includes just environmental responsibility. Strong sustainability is a whole new approach to doing business, where every consideration is made for the business to contribute toward a sustainable society.

This book is designed as a starting point for any business, to provide a structure and to initiate ideas on a wide range of important issues. What this book hopes to promote is that sustainability is not just about the environment, it is not ‘just’ about anything, but it also doesn’t have to be everything. 
But the more things it can be for your business, the more parts of your business should experience the benefit of the examination undertaken for that qualification. It is about adding value of the kind your familiar with and value of the kind you are not yet familiar with. Your business can benefit but people are right to be suspicious of those who, without knowing you or your business, presume they know exactly how. Lots of people want to help though, if you’ll give them an opportunity and an open ear. But make it a discerning ear and avoid the extremely negative views of “stop what you are doing you are damaging the planet” and engage those who ask: “what can you do that adds value to your business within our society and our eco-systems?&quot; 

Around the world businesses are leading the way in creating positive environmental and social change through their business. InterfaceFLOR company http://www.interfaceflor.com/ is often heralded as being one of those, but with an R&amp;D team of 16 or so people it is not surprising, a better (smaller) example is Patagonia clothing http://www.patagonia.com/international but better still are the two businesses showcased in this book [see above) both of which are New Zealand based. For some businesses it’s easier to know how and when to reconcile these ideas with the value and priority procedures they apply to deciding what is best, for others it is less clear. However for those who see big changes in the future and want to be prepared, then this book and these ideas should prove useful in helping you locate the place for your business in a more sustainable future. 

Applying the strong sustainability lens there will also be many new business opportunities. For instance the car share company, Cityhop http://www.cityhop.co.nz/ where cars are parked all over the city and available to be used an hour at a time, or All Good Bananas (http://allgoodbananas.co.nz/), capitalising on consumers desire to purchase ethically - the banana growers receive a fair price for their bananas. 

But it is not just whether the business would exist that is of interest to strong sustainability but if it did, how would it operate differently from now? What would your business do differently if its very existence contributed toward a more sustainable future for the planet and future generations? 
      
For more about strong sustainability, refer to Sustainable Aotearoa New Zealand's (SANZ) paper &quot;Strong Sustainability for New Zealand; Principles and Scenarios&quot;[http://www.phase2.org/documents/SSFNZ_web_310809.pdf].

= Measuring sustainable business practice =
Developing a system of measuring a business' financial results took many many years. The development of a non-financial measurement for sustainability is in its infancy. However, many large organisations (and some small) have been measuring and reporting on their sustainability performance for a number of years now. 

The sustainability reporting standard is the [www.globalreporting.org]. It can however, be a little daunting for a new-comer to sustainability. There are some more common areas for measurement included below:

;Environmental Results
* energy use 
* materials use
* energy efficiency results
* carbon emissions
* emissions and waste, e.g. carbon emissions, water discharged, waste by type and disposal methods
* water use 
* product improvements to minimize environmental impact
* results of initiatives to mitigate negative environmental impacts 

;Economic Results
* Standard entry level wage compared to minimum wage 
* Spending on locally based suppliers
* Financial implications for the organisations actives due to climate change

;Social Results (including ethical and cultural) 
* employee time donated to voluntary causes, 
* donations and in-kind support to community groups, 
* breaches of ethical behaviour, 
* breaches of regulatory and/or legal compliance, 
* customer labeling, 
* customer health and safety, 
* stakeholder trust, 
* staff perception of the organisation as a good citizen (referring to its environmental and social responsibility and ethical behavior), 
* specific engagement with Tangata Whenua about matters of cultural significance to Maori, 
* results of initiatives to mitigate negative social impacts
* partnerships within your supply chain that are designed to improve industry environmental and/or social outcomes.

;Identifying sustainability impacts
In some businesses, the main sustainability impacts are obvious. For instance, the key impact of a courier driver are carbon emissions from his vehicle and the key impact of a $2 shop would be natural resource use and waste to landfill due to the short life of the products. However, not all businesses have such obvious impacts. To help you work out your key impacts (in order to know where to concentrate your sustainability initiatives), the following prompts may help:

* significance to stakeholders (include representatives of future generations)
* technical information such as environmental reviews, and social impact reports
* Review of current and potential sustainable development issues that are of importance or potential importance to civil society – both from a risk and opportunity perspective. When considering risks, consider changing factors as well as current factors. For instance responses to climate change and accounting for carbon emissions were not considered by many businesses in the recent past. Now many are having to prepare for new taxes and other costs if a carbon based economy develops. 
* Review of international good practice and consideration of issues that are being addressed by industry leaders in sustainable development and the organisation’s peers
* Impacts and issues that are identified in standards such as the [http://www.globalreporting.org Global Reporting Initiative], [http://www.sa-intl.org SA8000], [http://www.unglobalcompact.org UN Global Compact]

= Background to the principles of sustainability =
These principles are an amalgamation of common themes represented in a number of more commonly known and accepted sustainability frameworks (included in the table below). 

It could be argued that the summarising of the themes into principles is somewhat arbitrary. That potential criticism is accepted although the best job has been done to accurately capture common themes into a usable framework for small business planning. Given the breadth of frameworks available, some more extreme (either weak or strong) interpretations are not used. However, these frameworks are used where examples are provided of weak and strong applications of the principles of sustainability.

== About the framework organisations ==

Below are the links to the frameworks used to develop the principles, as well as a fuller description of each framework. 

   
;[http://sustainable.org.nz/index.php?page=what-is-a-sustainable-business The Sustainable Business Network]

The Sustainable Business Network (SBN) states that while there is no easy answer to the question, &quot;what does a sustainable business look like?&quot;, one suggestion is that it is one which offers products and services that fulfil society's needs while placing an equal emphasis on people, planet and profits.


;[http://www.beehive.govt.nz/sites/all/files/30199-med-susined-developm.pdf New Zealand sustainable development programme of action (January 2003)]

This is a plan of action developed and undertaken by the New Zealand government in 2003. It was led by Environment Minister of the time, Marian Hobbs.

;[http://www.unglobalcompact.org The Global Compact]

The United Nations Global Compact is a strategic policy initiative for businesses that are committed to aligning their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. They are derived from: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, The International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, and The United Nations Convention Against Corruption.

;[http://www.ceres.org/Page.aspx?pid=416 Ceres]

The Ceres Principles are a ten-point code of corporate environmental conduct to be publicly endorsed by companies as an environmental mission statement or ethic. Embedded in that code of conduct was the mandate to report periodically on environmental management structures and results.

;[http://www.naturalstep.org The Natural Step]

The Natural Step Framework is a methodology for organisational planning. It is based on systems thinking, recognizing that what happens in one part of a system affects every other part. We begin by understanding the broader system within which problems occur and the principles governing success within that system. The Natural Step is based on four systems conditions that have been reworded as sustainability principles

;[http://www.iccwbo.org/policy/environment/id1309/index.html The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)]

The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) is a non-governmental organization serving world business. Its membership extends to more than 130 countries and includes thousands of business organizations and enterprises with international interests. In response to the World Commission on Environment and Development report, ICC developed a 'Business Charter for Sustainable Development' which sets out 16 principles for environmental management. The Charter covers environmentally relevant aspects of health, safety and product stewardship. Its objective is 'that the widest range of enterprises commit themselves to improving their environmental performance in accordance with the principles, to having in place management practices to effect such improvement, to measuring their progress, and to reporting this progress as appropriate, internally and externally' 

;[http://www.globalreporting.org The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)]

The Global Reporting Initiative is based on reporting guidelines that provide guidance for organizations to use as the basis for disclosure about their sustainability performance, and also provides stakeholders a universally-applicable, comparable framework in which to understand disclosed information. Below are listed the indicators required to report on. Core Indicators (CORE) have been developed through GRI’s multi-stakeholder processes, which are intended to identify generally applicable Indicators and are assumed to be material for most organizations. An organization should report on Core Indicators unless they are deemed not material on the basis of the GRI Reporting Principles. Additional Indicators (ADD) represent emerging practice or address topics that may be material for some organizations, but are not material for others. 

;[http://www.stats.govt.nz/Publications/NationalAccounts/sustainable-development/defining-principles.aspx Statistics New Zealand - Measuring New Zealand’s progress using a sustainable development approach (2009)]

Presents an overarching view of New Zealand’s environmental, economic, and social progress and whether that progress was consistent with sustainable development. The selected indicators provide information about whether we are meeting our current needs, how our resources are distributed, how efficiently we are using our resources, and what impact our actions may have on the stock of resources that will be available in the future.

;[http://www.phase2.org/documents/SSFNZ_web_310809.pdf Strong Sustainability for New Zealand – Principles and Scenarios (2009), Sustainable Aotearoa New Zealand (SANZ)] 

The principles included in the SANZ column come from the 2009 report by Sustainable Aotearoa New Zealand (SANZ) which outlines a way forward for a sustainable New Zealand. Although we have referred to them as principles, the report refers to them as the set of societal ethics and values required by those who commit to strong sustainability. 

;[http://www.nzbcsd.org.nz/_attachments/Charter_-_Sustainable_Business_Development.pdf The Charter for Sustainable Business Development (Danish Council for Sustainable Business Development), 2008]

The purpose of the Charter is to create a common basis for Danish companies that seek sustainable development for Danish and international societies.

&lt;!--Sein Lied ''Lubly Fan'' war in den ganzen Vereinigten Staaten so beliebt, dass die Minstrels den Liedtext änderten und dem örtlichen Publikum anpassten. Auf diese Weise entstanden Varianten wie ''New York Gals'' in New York City oder ''Boston Gals'' in Boston. Die bekannteste Variante wurde aber nach der Stadt Buffalo im Bundesstaat New York benannt (und hat mit dem bekannten Herdentier nichts zu tun).--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Binary search tree.svg|thumb|right|Example binary search tree with integer keys only]]
Prolog's built-in lists are handy, but sometimes a simple linear list is not enough. When you want to maintain an association between one set of elements ('keys') and another ('values'), you need an '''associative map''' data structure. Here's how such a structure can be implemented in Prolog using [[:w:Binary search tree|binary search trees]] (BSTs).

First we need a representation of search trees in Prolog terms. Remember that a BST is a binary tree with key-value pairs stored in the nodes. We can thus represent nodes as functors &lt;tt&gt;t(Key,Value,LeftChild,RightChild)&lt;/tt&gt;. The empty tree will be represented by the atom &lt;tt&gt;nil&lt;/tt&gt;.

But we don't want to program to this representation directly: by providing the appropriate predicates, we can specify an [[:w:Abstract data structure|abstract data structure]] (ADT). The reason for doing so is that we can later change our implementation to use [[:w:Self-balancing binary search tree|balanced binary trees]] or some other more sophisticated data structure. We shall call this ADT the ordered map, or &lt;tt&gt;ordmap&lt;/tt&gt;. Here are the basic operations on an ordmap:

* &lt;tt&gt;empty_map(-Map)&lt;/tt&gt;: unifies &lt;tt&gt;Map&lt;/tt&gt; with the empty map.
* &lt;tt&gt;lookup_ordmap(+Key, +Map, -Value)&lt;/tt&gt;: lookup the &lt;tt&gt;Value&lt;/tt&gt; associated with &lt;tt&gt;Key&lt;/tt&gt; in &lt;tt&gt;Map&lt;/tt&gt;.
* &lt;tt&gt;insert_ordmap(+Key, +Value, +Map0, -Map)&lt;/tt&gt;: insert the pair &lt;tt&gt;Key&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Value&lt;/tt&gt; in the map &lt;tt&gt;Map0&lt;/tt&gt;, yielding &lt;tt&gt;Map&lt;/tt&gt;. Note that afterwards, both &lt;tt&gt;Map0&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Map&lt;/tt&gt; are valid ordered maps, which differ by at most one element. This predicate fails if &lt;tt&gt;Key&lt;/tt&gt; is already present in &lt;tt&gt;Map0&lt;/tt&gt;.
* &lt;tt&gt;update_ordmap(+Key, +Value, +Map0, -Map)&lt;/tt&gt;: like &lt;tt&gt;insert_ordmap&lt;/tt&gt;, but removes any previous association of &lt;tt&gt;Key&lt;/tt&gt; with a different value (and always succeeds).
* &lt;tt&gt;remove_ordmap(+Key, +Map0, -Map, -Value)&lt;/tt&gt;: remove &lt;tt&gt;Key&lt;/tt&gt; from &lt;tt&gt;Map0&lt;/tt&gt;, yielding &lt;tt&gt;Map&lt;/tt&gt;. The value associated with &lt;tt&gt;Key&lt;/tt&gt; is returned in &lt;tt&gt;Value&lt;/tt&gt;. This predicate fails if &lt;tt&gt;Key&lt;/tt&gt; was not in &lt;tt&gt;Map0&lt;/tt&gt;.
* &lt;tt&gt;member_ordmap(+Map, -Key, -Value)&lt;/tt&gt;: backtracks over all key/value pairs in &lt;tt&gt;Map&lt;/tt&gt; by order of keys.
* &lt;tt&gt;rmember_ordmap(+Map, -Key, -Value)&lt;/tt&gt;: backtracks over all key/value pairs in &lt;tt&gt;Map&lt;/tt&gt; by reverse order of keys.
* &lt;tt&gt;size_ordmap(+Map, -Size)&lt;/tt&gt;: determines the number of elements in &lt;tt&gt;Map&lt;/tt&gt;.

For reasons that will become clear later on, keys in our ordered maps should always be ground terms.

The implementation of &lt;tt&gt;empty_map&lt;/tt&gt; is trivial:

&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
empty_map(nil).
&lt;/source&gt;

Our next predicate, &lt;tt&gt;lookup_map&lt;/tt&gt;, follows the usual recursion patterns for BST operations:

&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
lookup_ordmap(K, t(X,Y,L,R), V) :-
    (K == X -&gt;
        V = Y
    ; K @&lt; X -&gt;
        lookup_ordmap(K,L,V)
    ;
        lookup_ordmap(K,R,V)
    ).
&lt;/source&gt;

Note the use of &lt;tt&gt;==/2&lt;/tt&gt; instead of unification. The reason for doing so lies in the use &lt;tt&gt;@&lt;/2&lt;/tt&gt; which compares terms according to the ''standard order of terms''. In this ordering, for any two distinct terms &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt;, either &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; &lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; &lt;tt&gt;@&amp;lt;&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt; &lt;tt&gt;@&amp;lt;&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;. For example, &lt;tt&gt;a @&lt; b&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;X @&lt; Y&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;X @&lt; foo&lt;/tt&gt;. In fact, a free variable is always &lt;tt&gt;@&lt;&lt;/tt&gt; a ground term. But when two variables, or a variable and a ground term are unified, the ordering changes: after &lt;tt&gt;X=Y&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;X==Y&lt;/tt&gt; is also true. This is why keys should, in principle, always be ground terms: that way, the ordering is always preserved (but we leave the appropriate check up to the user of our ordered map data structure). Note that there is no such restriction on values, since they don't need to be ordered.

Also note that we have no case for &lt;tt&gt;nil&lt;/tt&gt;, since looking up anything in an empty tree will always fail.

[[:w:Binary search tree#Deletion|Deletion of an element]] from a binary search tree can be a bit tricky to implement; the following code replaces a node with two children by its in-order predecessor, which is the maximum element of the left subtree. It uses the &lt;tt&gt;rm_max&lt;/tt&gt; helper predicate to remove the maximum element from a subtree.

&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
remove_ordmap(K, t(X,Y,L0,R), t(X,Y,L,R), V) :-
    K @&lt; X,
    remove_ordmap(K,L0,L,V).
remove_ordmap(K, t(X,Y,L,R0), t(X,Y,L,R), V) :-
    K @&gt; X,
    remove_ordmap(K,R0,R,V).
remove_ordmap(K, t(X,V,L,R), T, V) :-
    K == X,
    (L == nil -&gt;
        T = R
    ; R == nil -&gt;
        T = L
    ;
        rm_max(L,L1,K1,V1),
        T = t(K1,V1,L1,R)
    ).
rm_max(t(K,V,L,nil), L, K, V) :- !.
rm_max(t(X,Y,L,R0), t(X,Y,L,R), K, V) :-
    rm_max(R0,R,K,V).
&lt;/source&gt;

The rest of the predicates are now easy to write:

&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
insert_ordmap(K, V, nil, t(K,V,nil,nil)).
insert_ordmap(K, V, t(X,Y,L0,R), t(X,Y,L,R)) :-
    K @&lt; X,
    insert_ordmap(K,V,L0,L).
insert_ordmap(K, V, t(X,Y,L,R0), t(X,Y,L,R)) :-
    K @&gt; X,
    insert_ordmap(K,V,R0,R).

member_ordmap(t(X,Y,L,R), K, V) :-
    member_ordmap(L,K,V) ;
    (X=K, Y=V) ;
    member_ordmap(R,K,V).

size_ordmap(nil, 0).
size_ordmap(t(_,_,L,R), N) :-
    size_ordmap(L,NL),
    size_ordmap(R,NR),
    N is NL+NR+1.
&lt;/source&gt;

''Exercise'': implement &lt;tt&gt;rmember_ordmap&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;update_ordmap&lt;/tt&gt;.

==Libraries==
Associative map data structures are built into the libraries of various Prolog implementations (though often not in compatible ways):
* SICStus provides [http://www.sics.se/sicstus/docs/4.0.7/html/sicstus/lib_002davl.html library(avl)]
* SWI-Prolog provides [http://gollem.science.uva.nl/SWI-Prolog/Manual/assoc.html library(assoc)]

Both libraries are based on [[:w:AVL tree|AVL trees]]; note that SICStus also provides a [http://www.sics.se/sicstus/docs/4.0.7/html/sicstus/lib_002dassoc.html#lib_002dassoc library(assoc)], but that is based on simple lists.

Hi! I am April!
I am currently at University, studying Paleaontology, in the planning stages of writing a paper exploring ways that prehistoric creature might have moved.&lt;br&gt;I am currently writing a novel that has now gotten through to editing stages (at least the first 15 chapters have, I am writing it a bit at a time.&lt;br&gt;I am a bit of a science geek, A levels in Biology, Chemistry and further geology. I like putting lots of science in to my novel, to make it as realistic as possible. Not easy, seeing as two characters can fly, many of them can teleport and two more are capable of telepathy. Oh well, I try my best.&lt;br&gt;I have a very long suffering Fiancé, who has put up with many late nights with me tapping away on the laptop, and I love him very much for it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would be pleased to talk to anyone, people who are interested in knowing more about me, or are interested in my novel (which I don't suppose you are)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;April xxx&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--[[User:April showers345|April showers345]] ([[User talk:April showers345|talk]]) 17:24, 28 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

== Download Html book for offline viewing. ==

I usually use unix &lt;wget&gt; to download things like a wikibook, but I'm not sure it works here. Is there an easier way to download a book in HTML? - the instructions about XML are baffling to a non-developer. Thank you, TFJ

:See if the book has a print version and do as save of the page that displays it (or use wget), there are then tools to unwikify the result.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:09, 14 August 2009 (UTC)

== How do I beak  a page into several pages? ==

I want to turn each chapter in the book on Category Theory into a separate page.  I can think of a couple of clumsy ways of doing this.  Is there an ''efficient'' way to do it? [[User:SixWingedSeraph|SixWingedSeraph]] ([[User talk:SixWingedSeraph|talk]]) 00:58, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

:Well I don't know how efficient this is, but I have made links out of the titles of the individual chapters.  So now the word &quot;Introduction&quot; now links to [[Category Theory/Introduction]].  Now all you have to do  is open the red link in one window, click on the edit link in the other, then copy and paste.  Just make sure if you do this, to mention in the edit summary that your copying this material from the [[Category Theory]] page.  Including some sort of link in necessary for copyright reasons.

== Main Page ==

There have been some comments on phasing out bookshelves more fully by giving greater prominence to the subject pages by replacing the links to bookshelves on the main page with links to subject pages.  You can read what was posted on [[Talk:Main_Page#Bookshelves_-.3E_Subjects|Talk:Main Page]] a year ago in the [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Archives/2007/November#Phase_out_Bookshelves|reading room archives]].  Posting here will hopefully allow for concerns to be addressed and opinions heard, as well as giving the proposal greater visibility. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:07, 23 June 2009 (UTC)

: Perhaps not surprisingly, I do have some concerns about changing the main page. Of course I would like to customize the Mathematics subject page, but some ongoing debates about my ideas have stopped me momentarily (and perhaps permanently) .  Overall I think it may be better to proceed to make changes and fix problems, this will give us some motivation to fix the problems.  

: Here are some of my thoughts. 
:# From a user perspective the distinction between categories and subjects is blurred.  I personally found it very confusing when I discovered the subject pages, and then discovered that clicking on the link that followed '''Subjects:''' a the bottom of a module did not take me to the subject page.  As we make subjects more prominent I expect this confusion to be worse.  I strongly recommend (as I mention periodically here) that we should either change that word to categories or link the actual subject pages.  But I think changing the word to categories is more realistic.
:# I would like some way of seeing the preservation of the information about development stages, and hopefully to include it on some way in the subject page.
:# As was mentioned in the original discussion we should include subjects in the default search. If it is not there already, it should be there.
:# This discussion will not get the attention it deserves.  For better or worse, a lot of people don't seem to keep up on the reading room.  Would it be appropriate to include a message at each of the book shelves inviting people to express their opinion? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 08:56, 24 June 2009 (UTC)

:: I think the use of &quot;Subject&quot; at the bottom in reference to a book's or page's categories was intended to indicate that a book's categories should match up with actual subjects. This does not work when seen on subpages of a book. It's a setting in the Mediawiki namespace that could be changed. 
::: I find it confusing as well.  [[User:Sj|Sj]] ([[User talk:Sj|talk]]) 16:52, 19 July 2009 (UTC)

:: Subjects appear to be in the default search now. I looked for &quot;mathematics&quot; when logged-out and [[Subject:Mathematics]] was the first result.

:: Past commenters in the archive did note that they were amenable to having different subject pages appear differently, so it would appear that you have the leeway to alter the mathematics subjects as you see fit. Since [[Subject:Mathematics]] is a top-level subject, it would be nice, in my opinion, if all the mathematics subjects had a consistent theme. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:38, 24 June 2009 (UTC)

:: If we make categories for each of the progress points, the subject pages can be broken down to pull books in sections with the ones that are in the subject's category and 100%, the subject's category and 75%, etc using DPL templates. But I don't know what to do about the books that are in the subject but not in a progress category. The list of all the books in the subject could be put below the ones with progress indicators. But then you'd have books that have been marked with a progress level listed twice: in the progress-indicated section ''and'' the progress-not-indicated section. The technicalities of generating a dynamic list that can reflect progress has to be worked out. Also, the progress indicators on the bookshelves may not be up to date, further complicating matters.

::A site-wide message at the top of the wiki is also something that could be done to really get attention on an issue.  Maybe people would be interested in a contest to redesign the main page at the same time, with people voting for their preferred version.  That would seem more worthy of a site-wide message than the mere proposal to change some links.  I suppose it would depend on how significant an issue must be before the creation of a notice is warranted. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:38, 24 June 2009 (UTC)

::A site-wide message is now up to get input on this issue. The issue with Subject replacing Category on book pages has been fixed.  Links on the main page have been reverted back to ones pointing to the bookshelves.  I thought there was consensus on this from past discussion and could only take the lack of response as tacit approval.  I never intended to delete bookshelves, but the mere changing of links has drawn ire.  It resulted in an edit war over which pages would be the destination through the addition of redirects to subject pages to point to bookshelves and later a notice that subjects were not being maintained and a link to the bookshelves.  This could have been prevented by fully protecting the pages, but then I would appear to be engaging in a one-man vendetta, which I did not take to be the case, given past discussion. This changeover was proposed in November 2007. Are subjects the future or were they just a nice idea in theory? I brought this issue back up and so I will not be the one to decide it.

::: &lt;s&gt;I am not sure what you mean when you say that the issue of replacing Subject by Category on book pages has been fixed.&lt;/s&gt; I see it is fixed on the subpages of a book, just not the main page. I would advocate changing it on all of teh pages of the book. For example, when I look at the bottom for example on the bottom of the [[Algorithms]] book it displays &quot;Subjects: Featured book | Books to be merged | Algorithms | Algorithms and data structures&quot;. The first two of which are not subjects in any sense of the word. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 11:25, 7 July 2009 (UTC)

===Deprecation===
I still think subjects are the future. We could play blame game, but I think the problem was that even though consensus was that bookshelves should be deprecated, a formal process for doing so was never discussed or formed, possibly because people didn't think one would be necessary. IMO I think all that is missing is a formal plan for moving forward with deprecating the bookshelves and apparently a formal process for doing so is needed. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:10, 6 July 2009 (UTC)

I think a straightforward way to move forward is to put a notice of deprecation at the top of every bookshelf and protect the bookshelves. After a month or more go through with completely deprecating the bookshelves. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:16, 6 July 2009 (UTC)

: Protecting a page in order to discourage updates doesn't seem to be a proper justification — in particular if the page in question is linked from the main page. (&quot;Page protections cannot be altered without proper justification.&quot; [[WB:ADMIN]]) In my opinion subject pages are just not ready yet to replace bookshelves: Have we solved the problem of sorting entries on the subject pages alphabetically? Do we show featured books prominently enough? (i.e. in the super-subjects)? Do we agree on abandoning progress indicators? Subject pages might have been a good idea, but the current implementation is a different issue. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 18:58, 6 July 2009 (UTC)

:: I agree with a lot of the issues Martin raises.  I am particularly glad to hear other people have been concerned about the prominence of featured books, it is something I have thought about but never articulated.  I don't see any need to protect the bookshelf pages.  If someone wants to come along and keep a deprecated page up to date, its their time not mine, this is a wiki after all.  I could go either way on subjects vs bookshelves, I will think about it and give a more well thought through opinion later.  In the probable case that we go with subjects, and we '''eventually''' make bookshelves redirects, I don't think we should delete the pages and recreate them as redirects.  Why not preserve the edit history?  As a final thought I would like to suggest that we should restore the bookshelf pages that have been deleted thus far.[[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 19:55, 6 July 2009 (UTC)

::Featured books are not displayed prominently now. The question is not whether subject pages advertise them well enough, but whether we should add such advertisements to the new subject pages or the old bookshelf pages.
::Also, books are not generally arranged alphabetically on bookshelves now, and progress indicators are not maintained, accurate, and follow no kind of sitewide standards. Saying that we cant switch to subject pages because they do not have these things is moot because bookshelves don't have them either. What we need to do now is decide which method we want to pursue in the long term, and spend the effort to improve those. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 11:12, 11 July 2009 (UTC)

:::Features books are displayed prominently on some bookshelves (e.g. the [[Wikibooks:Languages bookshelf]]). Some bookshelves order books within the subtopics alphabetically (e.g. the [[Wikibooks:Languages bookshelf]]). I assume that most of the very few active authors of language books try to keep the progress indicators up to date. After all the discussions about phasing out bookshelves it is certainly not surprising that people stopped contributing to bookshelves. From my point of view some people decided to switch to subject pages but they have failed to show that this was a good decision. Instead they keep talking about abandoning bookshelves as if all the problems with subject pages would then magically disappear. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 09:49, 12 July 2009 (UTC)

:::: I noticed another possible issue with deprecation, that relates to a comment below.  If we delete bookshelf pages, then will all books show up on the [[Special:LonelyPages|Orphaned page list]]?  I noticed this because I saw [[Mathematics for Caribbean Advance Mathematics]] on this list when I knew I had put it in a subject at some point.  Independently I noticed while categorizing pages (I would try to work from the end of the list because [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] categorizes so much faster than I) that these maintenance lists seem to only go out to about 5000 entries or so.  I thought someone said before we were currently around 3,000 books.  Does this if we go to subject pages and we pass 5,000 books that we loose the any hope of finding the orphaned pages.  Even if we could make this lists indefinitely large, does it make sense to wade through all of the books to find the orphaned pages.  This sort of fits in with comments below about not swamping the uncategorized pages list.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:36, 13 July 2009 (UTC)

::::: I've not been using the orphaned pages list as I was of the feeling that because this isn't an encyclopedia, books won't be necessarily linking to each other. Regardless of the limit displayed, they will indeed all show up in the orphaned list if not linked to from elsewhere should bookshelves be deleted. Given that MediaWiki was designed for Wikipedia, this may be a situation where we have to accept that not all the tools are ideal for our use. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:09, 13 July 2009 (UTC)

:::::: It might be interesting to take a look at.  I have spent the morning going through some of the things that are there and seeing if it could really be useful.  Let me start by saying it is not the type of this that ever should be empty a &lt;u&gt;small&lt;/u&gt; handful of the things that show up there are simply pages that are being whipped into shape before they are made public.  This list does seem to collect pages that do have problems. For many of the books, the problems are so sever the books would also be listed in other places.  But not quite all, as mentioned above.
:::::: I suppose what I am discovering is that unlinked pages within books can also be a problem.  Because long term it can lead to a duplication of effort.  Examples might be [[Topology/Real analysis/Constructing_the_real_numbers]] which was a single page that got left out of a move, and this lead to someone else writing on the subject.  Or [[Number Theory/Irrational, Rational, Algebraic, And Transcendental Numbers]] and [[Number Theory/Irrational Rational and Transcendental Numbers]] where because the page wasn't linked properly from the table of contents, someone came along several years later and created a startlingly similar page.  On a different sort of duplication of effort note, I realized going through this that I had categorized lots of modules into a book category that were not linked to by the book in any way.  In the case of several of the [[Foundations_of_Education_and_Instructional_Assessment|FEIA]] modules they were more or less blank pages templates waiting to be filled in.  With the current edition maybe that is not so terrible, it is possible someone will look for those pages and link them from the book somehow.  But with the older editions I feel like that may not have been the best use of my effort, perhaps it would have been better to delete them.  I am still fairly open minded about this list, but I am curious to hear what people think. (Please don't tell me that we that we had this list and we still missed the examples I gave, I realize this. I am still curious if it is a tool worth trying to keep).
  
:::: One other question that I have, how do we find books that are not on subject pages, but are perhaps categorized in some way?  This is mostly an academic point, but checking the letter A to see if this ever happens in practice I found [[Accurizing]], [[All About Maine]], [[Aros Developer Zune]] (which maybe should not be counted, as it is in the orphaned page category, but someone had to populate it there),  and [[Attitude Power Trim]].  The situation I am concerned about is that someone comes along creates a new page and categorizes in some category that doesn't directly appear on a subject page, say a reading level.  Is it then very hard to notice this book is not attached to any subject, (assuming that it is in with 3.000 other books on the orphaned page list)?

::::: Sadly this is something I have come across. Someone ran a bot with good intentions to add the alphabetical classification to every book in the wiki to gain a better count of the books. However, alphabetical is not as useful as a bookshelf/subject page entry. With the alphabetical classification, those books are no longer uncategorized. The only way I can detect such books is if they have subpages that were not categorized. For this reason I always check a book's main page for correct categorization before applying categories to subpages. All those one-page books that only have {{tlx|alphabetical}} on them will escape my view unless I go through the alphabetical listings by hand.  There were books that also had bad naming conventions that had {{tlx|alphabetical}} added to every page of the book since they weren't technically subpages of the main page.  I'm somewhat of the mind that I'd like a bot run to undo the previous bot's edits, and remove {{tlx|alphabetical}} from any books that only have that. Unfortunately, I don't think that can be done. A similar problem exists for books with nonexistent categories, though those show up under &quot;wanted categories&quot;. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:09, 13 July 2009 (UTC)

===Sorting===
I had altered the templates the Subjects called in order to allow them to be sorted using the gadget in [[Special:Preferences]] titled &quot;Sort HTML lists&quot;. If you check that box you'll see they all get sorted in alphabetical order. From what I've read this gadget is required in order to overcome a limitation imposed by the use of an older version of the Dynamic Page List extension.  Featured books are displayed a second time in their own section on the right-hand side of the subject pages. I don't know if that is prominent enough for you or not.  As for progress indicators, I've yet to see anyone come up with a workable ''solution'' from a technical and feasibility standpoint, should they actually need to be kept. The bookshelves won't be linked to from the main page should I undo my undo, and this is probably why the subjects have not evolved considerably&amp;mdash;nobody cares because they're not linked to from the main page. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:52, 6 July 2009 (UTC)

:: Thanks, I wasn't aware that I have to change my user settings. Is it sufficient to display the featured book &quot;French&quot; in the right column on [[Subject:French language]], which is a sub-subject of [[Subject:Languages of Europe]], which is a sub-subject of [[Subject:Languages]]? Are you kidding? With respect to a workable ''solution'': bookshelves. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 10:42, 7 July 2009 (UTC)

::: I know I'm late to the debate. (It started in 2007?? How did I miss it.) But I completely fail to see the advantages of subject pages over bookshelves. Compare [[Subject:Mathematics]] and [[Wikibooks:Mathematics_bookshelf]]. I just can't understand why the consensus is that the former is ''better'' than the latter. To being with, it doesn't have progress bars. It doesn't seem to sort books correctly; Why, for example, is Linear algebra considered a analysis book? Also, I don't think it is a good idea to place books into separate pages; it's just not a good browsing experience. What is worse, for some technical reasons I don't understand, I can't find a way to fix those problems. For example, how can I put progress bars? I'm for any &quot;improvement&quot; in organization of books. Being bold is ok; if you can see ways to fix problems or make improvement, you should go ahead. BUT we never allow anyone to be bold to engage in destruction. -- [[User:TakuyaMurata|Taku]] ([[User talk:TakuyaMurata|talk]]) 22:15, 6 July 2009 (UTC)

:::: I disagree with every word. You're trying to compare the aesthetics of two pages, one that was made in only a few seconds compared to one that required lots of effort over lots of time to produce. The problem with the current bookshelf pages is that they need to be manually maintained, and so they are always out of date, misleading, or even incorrect. Progress indicators are fun looking colorful pictures, but their use is arbitrary and they mean inconsistent things. A reader looking at {{stage short|100%}} might assume that the book is complete and perfect, when that is never the case. Our books here are never &quot;complete&quot;, and even a cursory overview of some of our [[Wikibooks:Featured books|best books]] will show that nothing in our entire collection has reached the &quot;perfect&quot; stage yet. 
:::: Bookshelves need to be manually maintained, and that's a stupid system for us to embrace. We have the software tools here to automate the process, to maintain links automatically, to organize things how we want them, and to keep things up to date and accurate without having to wait for the next editor to come in and perform a lot of rote &quot;organizing&quot; busy work. The time and effort of our volunteers is far too precious to expect them to be manually maintaining large lists of links to books, especially when the technical capabilities exist for those lists to be maintained automatically as part of the software. Subject pages aren't pretty or perfect ''now'', but they offer us the potential for improved maintainability and extendability that bookshelves do not now and will never offer.
{{Goodbook/Control Systems|box=float: right; width: 350px; margn: 5px;}}
:::: I will say that the current subject pages are still young. They are more prototype then final implementation and a lot of work is going to be needed to make things the way we want them. The benefit to subject pages is that they are flexible enough to do that. We aren't limited to a single bookshelf page that is displayed in one way for everybody, we can mix and match and show lists of books that we want to show. If you don't like the way one particular subject page looks, '''fix it'''. If you don't like how sub-subjects are arranged, rearrange them or even create a new subject page with lists the way ''you want them''. Want to see featured books displayed more prominently higher in the subject hierarchy? We have [[Template:Goodbook/French|templates]] for all our featured books, feel free to sprinkle them liberally all over the place. In fact. I'm going to put one right here for the hell of it.
:::: The question here is &quot;how do we organize our collection of almost 3000 books (and growing) in a way that is maintainable, extensible, easy to implement and easy to browse&quot;. And I guarantee you that the answer is not &quot;do nothing and stick with the non-solution that we already have&quot; or &quot;sit on our hands because change is scary&quot;. When there is something that we do not like we do not refuse to fix it out of fear that things may get a little worse before they get better: we '''be bold''' and fix them. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 11:37, 11 July 2009 (UTC)

::: Let me ask a few naive questions.  First about the &quot;Sort HTML lists&quot;, does this effect any other html lists, or only the dynamic page lists?  If it is only the dynamic page lists, is it an option that could be set by default? Also, if we are using an older version of the Dynamic page list extension, is it possible to update to a newer version that doesn't have these limitations? 

:::: The update to a newer version of the Dynamic page list extension was rejected recently (some months). Does &quot;sortListInHTML&quot; affect dynamic page lists?

::::: I was incorrect, it seems that it was just a bit too computationally expensive on the server.  The discussion was [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Archives/2008/February#Dynamic_page_lists|here]] &lt;s&gt;but reading through it makes one point clear. It should not be necessary to change any user settings to achieve alphabetically sorting.  I am no expert in HTML so this is news to me,  but apparently you simply need to place the list within a DIV and give it a sortListInHTMLi class to get the list sorted.  Can't this be implemented directly on the subject pages? And there would be no need to bother users about their preferences.  Perhaps their are compatibility issues I am not thinking of, I don't how it would work on older browsers etc.&lt;/s&gt;  I think I misunderstood how this solution worked.

===Layout===
I would like to make specific what I think is the problem with the Featured books at the moment.  For example, [[Formal Logic]] is a featured book that doesn't appear on the lists of under featured books at the [[Subject:Mathematics]] page because it is under a sub-subject.  It would be nice to have all featured books appear at the top level.  This may be accomplished by adding the top level subject to all of the books.  Of course, one then may not (or may) want the list of all books in the subject displayed at the top level.  

: I agree that featured books should appear in the super-subjects. Other people disagree. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 09:29, 7 July 2009 (UTC)

:: Really?!? What was their problem with the idea?[[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 09:33, 7 July 2009 (UTC)

::: I guess it is an implementation problem. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 10:42, 7 July 2009 (UTC)

Now I would like to speak directly to some of Taku's specific questions about mathematics.  I also find the current layout of the [[Subject:Mathematics]] page inferior to the [[Wikibooks:Mathematics_bookshelf]].  When the decision to move to subject pages was made, it was made clear that the individual subjects should be free to customize their appearance.  What was seen as the real advantage of subject pages is that lists of books could be automatically generated, so to change where something appears simply adding/removing a word at the in the subject template that appears on the books main page. This is supposed to reduce the effort it takes to maintain the subject page.  This being said, let me say that I never really questioned the ideas of which would take less maintenance, I just went with it because I thought decision had been made.  I had long wanted to create a very close approximation to what the Mathematics bookshelf currently is by making some appropriate categories and using some of this dynamic page list features (like category intersection) to make sublists to display.  I did encounter some other editors who thought my ideas were not feasible, so I have paused while I get more community input.  Maybe we could fix the browsing experience.  No one has a good way to fix the progress bars currently.

The categorization of books there is not perfect and I know it, but this is something we can correct.  Since you asked specifically about Linear algebra, (I am assuming you mean [[Linear Algebra with Differential Equations]] and not [[Linear Algebra]]) I [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Linear_Algebra_with_Differential_Equations&amp;diff=1529695&amp;oldid=1521117 was responsible] for that, and my thinking was that if ever evolves to the point it contains some existence theory for ODE's or some information about non-linear ODE's (as it claims it will at some point) then it contains some non-trival amount of analysis and should be listed there.  You can feel free to undo that edit if you like, I won't be slighted.  There are many other places that categorization could also be improved, and I would like to talk to you (and some other mathematically inclined folks) about it at some point.  

You may be interested in a very rough idea of how I think we could make the mathematics subject page appear more like the bookshelf page, and have created a rough page in my [[User:Thenub314/sandbox|sandbox]].  I would love some feedback about the idea.  Lastly let me say that my mockup still suffers from some problems, alphabetization, which maybe is fixed.  There are still no progress bars, but it may not be possible to put them in.  But in this way we could generate a listing of all the books at the top level.  And possibly fix the problem with featured books. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 08:32, 7 July 2009 (UTC)

:A few comments. Using dynamic generated lists wasn't the only reason for subject pages. Having a dedicated namespace means it is possible to search by subject only and to see a [[Special:Allpages/Subject:|complete list of subjects]] easily. I agree that the current layout/appearance of the subject pages isn't the best, but there is no requirement that subject pages remain that way. I think the appearance is a separate issue, but if people feel that the appear needs to be improved first that's fine. Perhaps a bug should be filed requesting that sorting alphabetically be added to DynamicPageList so javascript isn't a requirement. Recently support for showing only stable or quality pages was added to the version of DynamicPageList used by Wikimedia projects which could also be useful. Why should featured books show up on the major subject pages? I think it makes more sense for featured books to be seen on the subject pages in which the books are about. However I think that is a distraction on the issue of bookshelves vs subjects because Featured books aren't even given any special intention on bookshelves at all so its not like bookshelves have any advantage there. There is a [[Subject:Featured books]] page as well, but I don't think it makes any sense.  Bookshelves used sections to separate books, subject pages just use separate pages instead, which has the advantage that subject pages are smaller and can load more quickly which is a plus for dialup, wifi and mobile users. How about instead of trying to squeeze everything onto major subjects, there is Subject Map of sorts that lists all subjects and all books for people who want it? Something similar to [[Wikibooks:Departments]]. Alternatively this map could just list all featured books by subject.

[[User:Darklama/Subject]] demonstrates an alternative layout that I've worked on and would like to eventually adopt. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:23, 7 July 2009 (UTC)

:: It is not completely a red herring, some bookshelves do indeed single out featured books.  I suppose to answer your question I would say for the same reason featured books show up on the main page, we would like to show readers the best we have.  I am also do not like the style of visiting a subject page and only encountered with only a list of Related Subjects and a few odd books that are not sorted into these related subjects yet.  Why not encounter the list of books, then if you want a shorter list you can go directly to the sub-subject?  The argument about Load times is not very convincing as individual modules are easily as large as the pages we are talking about.

::: The odd books that are not sorted in the related subjects are often of a general nature, or otherwise like with the bookshelves people just don't know where the book should go and are relying on other people to refine it for them. I think its important to consider dialup, wifi and mobile users and am convinced of its importance, so I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on that. A separate page listing would not inconvenience such users as much as requiring people to first load a big page. The main difference I had in mind with the departments comparison of an overview is that it would be a separate page linked to from [[Subject:Major Subjects]] instead, so people who want it could click there first and then the subject map or individual subjects. MediaWiki provides some mobile features, I am not sure what all it does, but it might address modules by letting them load only a section at a time. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:36, 7 July 2009 (UTC)

:: Subject pages all look the same right now because I used a template to create them all initially. This was an expediency measure, the goal was to create pages and put their mechanics into place first and allow interested editors to come around later and improve them. I am certainly no artist, and you can see that from the aesthetic quality of the template I used.
:: I don't know what about any ideas you have would be considered infeasible, and I don't know who would have said that. However, I can say that making a change to one subject page doesn't imply the change would need to be made everywhere. If you want to make a change to [[Subject:Mathematics]], please do it without delay. In fact, I may make some improvements this morning just to prove that it can be done. Seriously, '''be bold''' about fixing things, you don't need to wait for people or even wait for agreement in order to prototype something new.

::: Well I feel I have attempted to be bold about fixing things.  The results haven't been very encouraging. I got no further then creating a single category (which had existed a month before).  Then I got to have a long conversation with two administrators about why my ideas made no sense.  I never even got as far as being able to make a change at the subject page and I was told that I should come here to get community involvement (hence the thread I started [[#Request_for_comments|above]]).  The closest thing I felt to support was when Taku came across the mathematics subject page and had the same gut reaction as myself, and decided to redirect the subject page to the bookshelf page.  But it has been explained to me that the structure of the mathematics bookshelf page is the way it is because the people there were apathetic and that it  has '''only''' had its current from for something like 3 years.  Even when I get a sense from people that perhaps some ideas about how to improve wikibooks to make the transition to subjects smoother are reasonable, I get responses like to the effect that these changes couldn't happen without first convincing Darklama.

:::::: I suspected I was being referred to in the above paragraphs but it's clear now that I'm involved. I largely stayed out of the discussion between Thenub314 and Darklama once I made them aware of each others' actions/positions and left them to sort it out as this wasn't a major issue for me.  Whether Darklama convinced Thenub314 or vice versa was to be seen. Darklama engaged in the same sort of dialogue with me when the category referenced above existed the first time.  He could have simply reverted ''my'' actions back then but he didn't and made an attempt to gain consensus/compromise.  That approach appeared to be needed again.

:::::: I'll note that while I have the same position as ''Darklama'' on [[:Category:University level mathematics books]] (the category listed above and formerly [[:Category:University level mathematics]]), I have the same position as ''Thenub314'' on the labeling of categories on pages (the topic referenced by the diff above).  Buy-in was needed because I didn't want to get into a revert war with Darklama in the Mediawiki namespace. He initiated the change on the relevant page and therefore he was a concerned party as a ''major contributor'' to the page, not as an ''administrator''.  The dispute over this single category is symbolic of this thread as a whole and I doubt that either situation will result in an outcome everyone is happy with. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:19, 12 July 2009 (UTC)

===Maintenance===
So, the use of subject pages is meant to reduce maintenance. But is maintaining bookshelves a problem right now? I can see generalizing lists (in fact, hundreds of them) of books automatically is a kind of neat. But I don't think it is needed. New books don't get created in a pace that requires any sort of automatic categorization. In case of math books, from what I have seen, maybe one or two &quot;serious&quot; books are added to math bookshelves every year. (Some &quot;books&quot; have essentially no content, and we should count them.) As far as I know, there is maintenance problem with bookshelves. (But then your milage may vary.) I can also see the point of having a dedicated namespace for listing of books. In fact, Wikipedia has portal or something namespaces for this purpose. But this can be achieved by simply moving bookshelves to subject namespaces. (Then maybe we should rename bookshelves to subjects; I never liked the name &quot;shelves&quot;.) Actually, Wikibooks has a more serious problem of growth, which I will articulate in a new section below. -- [[User:TakuyaMurata|Taku]] ([[User talk:TakuyaMurata|talk]]) 23:00, 7 July 2009 (UTC)
:: OT: I find the idea of using the &quot;wiki to book&quot; feature directly as a way of composing wikibooks to be... interesting.  It would certainly be a change from the current system, where a page is created ''within'' the context of a book, and there is no simple way to have it show up in multiple books at once.  Since books tend to offer narrative linking their elements together, this might be difficult to pull off.  [a wikipedia 'book' has no overarching narrative structure for that reason]  On the other hand, a slight modification that supports a small bit of original narrative text and a[n often larger] shared chapter/page that is identical across many books might be possible.  [[User:Sj|Sj]] ([[User talk:Sj|talk]]) 16:52, 19 July 2009 (UTC)

: Subject pages are suppose to improve maintainability and allow for a more flexible system that can more easily grow as the community grows. Part of that involves a shift in focus. With bookshelves when a new book is created if a book contributor wants the book listed they have to go look through the bookshelves and try to figure out where to place the book. This can involve editing multiple pages. If a book's title or focus changes then those pages can require updating again. If the focus of the bookshelves change or refined they can require updating what books are listed and that can lead to some books becoming unlisted. I think its a very fragile system. With subjects you just update the book, which frees up time that people would rather spend on writing books on actually being able to write books. ''New books are created every day.'' I think another intent with subjects pages was to move away from a dependency on hierarchy. I don't know if your familiar with the electronic system used by libraries (and I don't really know to what extent they vary), but with the libraries I've been to I don't usually have to browse subjects in a hierarchy to find books, instead I can either look for a specific book title or I can search for books by subject and I can only see what books relate to that subject and I am given suggestions for other related subjects to look through. I don't think Wikibooks benefits from simply moving bookshelves to the subject namespace and I think doing so would be to ignore why people wanted and supported the subject namespace in the first place and why people wanted to discontinue the bookshelves and supported its discontinuation. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:00, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

:: I don't see how subject pages solve some of these problems.  If a author wants his book listed he still have to go though the subjects and decide where it fits.  We have just moved the editing form the bookshelf page to the books main page. (Perhaps it is &lt;u&gt;slightly&lt;/u&gt; less editing with subjects).  Changes in focus still require require changes in subject, but relative to writing a book all of the amount of editing we are talking about are trivial.  It is still possible to delist books by removing them from a subject because you decided that the book is no longer appropriate for the subject it is in.  In fact if anything one could now delist books in mass, if someone comes along and decides that logic is not a branch of mathematics (you'd be surprised at how many people believe this), then it is easy to remove logic from mathematic and have it under no main subject.  Checking the new page log I disagree that new books a created every day.  New books are created every week, perhaps, but not quite every day.  And looking at many of the things that are created.  I don't understand your point at all about hierarchy.  Subject pages are currently very hierarchical.  Yes we can now search by subject, but we would have the same ability if we just moved the bookshelves to the subject namspace and called them subjects.  The current listing of &quot;Related subjects&quot; is not a suggestion based what was searched.  In fact, so far as I have seen, is is not even related subjects, but sub-topics, so much so they are even listed this way on some subject pages.  So what we are doing with subjects and &quot;Related subjects&quot; is in no way comparable to what libraries are doing.  I don't think we are ignoring what people wanted, it just seems to be that what people currently want is not the same as what people wanted.

::: Moving the editing to the books main page involves less editing with subjects. Having the software provide suggestions when categorizing by subjects would reduce the need to look through subject pages even more. Yes delisting books is still possible, but the purpose isn't to make doing so impossible, just to make it less easy to do so by accident. Yes this system makes it much easier to delist in mass, but I think it makes it less likely that it was done so by accident. The relates subjects aren't exactly based on what words you searched for, but they are related to the subject you are looking at in a similar way to what electronic library systems do. When I do a search in a library's catalog first I'm given matches of subjects that might relate to what I'm looking for, then when I view a particular subject I'm offered further subject suggestions related to the subject I picked as well as books. Maybe there isn't enough cross-relating yet like an electronic library system does. Most subject pages were based on the same template, and most of the initial work was done by the same person, but that doesn't mean that is how it is suppose to be, was suppose to be, or how it should be. If you look back at the original discussion for approving the subject namespace there was consensus to be more flexible then that. I don't think there should really be a &quot;top&quot; or &quot;main&quot; subject page, but one I think is provided for the sake of being able to browse subjects. With an electronic library system you could enter the system at any place within it, and the same is true of subject pages when you do a search like when I do a search with an electronic library system. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 10:50, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

Looking into Dynamic Page List further and thinking outside the box of the existing DPL templates that call the DPL extension's tags, I've discovered that more than one category can be applied as a &quot;notcategory&quot;. [[Template:CategoryIntersection]] limits you to one, at least for now... I've created [[:Category:25%]], [[:Category:50%]], [[:Category:75%]], and [[:Category:100%]] and filed the books in [[Subject:Mathematical analysis]] into them based on the progress indicated on [[Wikibooks:Mathematics bookshelf]].  Modifying the code of the subject and using a final DPL call with several &quot;notcategory&quot;s avoids the duplication I thought would be inevitable if only one &quot;notcategory&quot; could be used.

:I'm not suggesting that the use of subject pages reduce some editing times. But is it worth it? For all the complexity, for all the transition costs. Yes, currently, to start a new book, you have to edit a bookshelf, but is that the time really a problem at present? If editors are routinely starting new books every day in the same way they create new articles in Wikipedia, it makes sense to automatize the starting of new articles. But this is not the case. For example, I started just two or three books since I joined the project, since it takes a lot more time to finish books. Is there any ''concrete'' evidence that maintaining bookshelves is a significant bottleneck in productivity? All shown so far is just a theory, and the transition costs (e.g., loss of progress bars, increase in complexity, etc) seems to outweight meager benefits. In any case, since I haven't seen a project-wide poll or something, I don't agree there is a consensus favoring the switch. -- [[User:TakuyaMurata|Taku]] ([[User talk:TakuyaMurata|talk]]) 11:42, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

:: There are gadgets to automate the starting of new books too. See [[Special:Preferences]] -&gt; Gadgets. A project-wide poll took place in November 2007, as has been pointed out several times now.

:: You just posted under a solution I came up with to show books' progress on subject pages. No, there won't be progress bars; there would be progress sections.

:::&quot;there are no transition costs because ...&quot;! Of course there are transition costs.  Your work as been part of the cost :).  There is also cost going forward.  There are disagreements that will continue about what subject pages should look like, should there be any uniformity to the different subject pages, where do featured books appear etc.  Do we allow a book to be in both applied mathematics and mathematics? At one point I thought sure, and you reverted my edit.   There is lots to be decided still, all of which represents cost.  Not to mention, who says the books are currently in the right subjects.  As Taku points out, perhaps some things are in the wrong place, and we would have to work to correct that.  In addition we have to go through and place books in the appropriate development categories, and decide if your solution is acceptable.  It gets the job done, but it is bit more disruptive to the page then the small little squares next to the book.  I am not saying I couldn't live with that, I am glad to see something can be done, and thank you for putting in the work to find a possible solution.  Just don't suggest that we can replace the links at the main page and the transition is complete. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 12:54, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

:::: How is that any more of a cost then with bookshelves? People still have to do the same things with bookshelves. The only difference I see is that with bookshelves books get lost in the shuffle easier, bookshelves are slower to reflect changes to how books are categorized, changes in book titles, changes when books are split or merged. Any system used has some sort of cost-time issues and benefits. The past consensus was that there was more of a benefit in the transition costs of moving to subjects then there was in sticking to bookshelves or in maintaining bookshelves. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:57, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

::::: I am not convinced it is less costly.  And not every maintenance task is easier with subjects.  For a simple example, I recently wanted to move where the [[Topology]] book appears out of geometry and into a new subject, preferably named Topology, and then throw [[Combinatorial Topology]] into this new subject with it.  But in order to do this it was first necessary to recategorize every page of the [[Topology]] book to be a category called &quot;Topology (book)&quot;.  I had this very same problem when I first started working on the mathematics subject page, which had many book pages under it, and also with the Algebra subject.  I even pointed out this was likely to be a problem back in March and you told me that the capital/lower casing takes care of this most of the time.  To take another related example, imagine that sometime down the line when subject pages are stable and don't need to edited often, someone can start a book, categorize all of its pages using the name of the subject the book is on.  Because these things are dynamic one it may take a long time for someone to notice the pollution of the dynamic lists, because it won't appear on anyones watchlist.  By this time it is noticed there may be alot more work to do.  So now to make sure no vandalism has occurred one needs to actually visit these pages on a regular basis.  So I am not convinced this takes less maintenance, and I know it was decided that it would be once, but ''now'' we are in the thick of it, it is much less clear to me.[[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 14:37, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

:::::: You would of needed to do that for the category system anyways so that categories wouldn't be polluted. Bookshelves can easy get out of sync with categories and people wouldn't notice a problem for a lot longer. People can also get stuck trying to figure out which one was most recently changed or which one should be fixed. At least with subject pages a problem would be immediately apparent when viewed. A watchlist won't help you know that a book's placement in bookshelves has changed while the category did not, or even where the book went to. A watchlist can help you know that a book's placement in the subject system has changed though by simply adding the book to your watchlist. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:54, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

:::::: Where to begin... sure a watch list would let you know that a books placement on a bookshelf has changed, you just watch the bookshelves that contain books you edit.  If someone moves it you can find where the book has gone to by checking the  &quot;What links here&quot; page.  (Or check the edit history of whoever moved it.)  Where as if someone moves logic somewhere else, and your book is filed under logic, you have might not notice (and might not be happy about) the fact your book is no longer accessible through the mathematics subject. Of course you could watch all the subject pages which contain your book, and the parents of those subject pages and so on, but that is just as complicated as watching the bookshelves. Previously the categories for Algebra and Topology contained pages for these books, there was no problem.  Then when we wanted to created Algebra and Topology subjects, that necessitated clearing out these categories and making them into something else. That is, it was the creation of subjects that created the maintenance problem.  Why is it a big problem if bookshelves get out of sync with categories?  Both are supposed offer a way to browse books, but there is no real need for both systems to be in lock step.  Yes you could see if someone polluted categories of subject pages by just looking at them. The question is how often do you expect to look at a given category or subject page once it is finished.  My point was bookshelves have the advantage of being resilient to this kind of problem. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 17:37, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

::::::: No. Subjects only brought more attention to and highlighted an already exist problem with categories. Categories were polluted long before the subject namespace. Subject categories existed long before the subject namespace. Conflicts between subject category names and book category names existed long before the subject namespace. I expect subject pages to be looked at as often as bookshelves would be. I don't think the bookshelves are more resilient to problems. My point is that you are blaming subjects for creating problems it didn't create. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:37, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

:::::::: In the cases of Algebra and Topology I mentioned above subjects '''did''' create the problem.  Before that these categories clearly stated that they contained the pages of specific books.  There was no pollution to speak of, the categories described what they were and contained what they described.  It was the desire to create subjects by the same name that made it necessary to alter these categories that were doing a fine job of what they set out to do.  Thus as I was trying to say creating subjects may create a non-trivial amount of maintenance to be done.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:32, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

::::::::: The Algebra category may have clearly stated its intentions to be for a specific book, but it was not being used that way. Other books and even subpages of other books were listed in that category. The Algebra category was far from being the only category that didn't consist of and weren't doing what was described. Again subjects didn't create that problem. If anything I think subjects helped to solve problems. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:22, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

::::::::: Your right now that I think back to it, I did a lot of that work back in march and there were somethings in the algebra category that were out of place.  Looking back through edit histories 60% of the other books that were listed in this category became added there because people were adding inappropriate subject tags.  With many of the other pages  the other pages that were there there had been lots of take about merging.  Topology didn't suffer from the same disorganization, and neither does calculus, which is something I would also like to fix.  Subjects do create problems if you happen to want a subject name identical to an existing book name.  Subjects may have caused us all to look closer at categories for a while and fix the problems we found, but it is a temporary artifact of us setting them up.  Once subjects are set up you must admit that this kind of pollution can and probably will happen to some subjects over time. I see no clear evidence that subjects are currently decreasing maintenance, or that they will &quot;cheaper&quot; to maintain in the long run.  Perhaps they will, but it is not that they win hands down. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 13:23, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

I'd also like to point out our different systems: bookshelves, subjects, categories, alphabetical classification, Library of Congress classification, Dewey Decimal classification, and reading levels. To have progress indicated on subjects there's now a possibility of having a system classifying by progress level.

(outdent)&lt;br/&gt;
I've got two comments to make here, one about maintenance of subjects versus bookshelves, and one about category naming conventions as they pertain to one-word book names.

There seem to be at least two dimensions of maintenance considerations involved with subjects versus bookshevles.
*There's start-up versus long-term maintenance.  In order to plan for the long-term benefit of the project, start-up is to be ''ignored'', because in the long run it's trivial (only in the here-and-now is it an appallingly hugely colossal pain).
*There's the amount of work involved, versus the likelihood of cumulative errors.  The amount of work is far less important than the errors.  We're now talking about long-term maintenance on a massive scale, and that means that (a)&amp;nbsp;much of it will be done by users who lack expertise, and (b)&amp;nbsp;there won't necessarily be ''anyone'' actively watching out for the interests of any given book.  My impression of the maintenance argument for subjects is that subjects make it less likely that, as a result of long-term shifts due to maintenance by inexpert users, books might get dropped from bookshelves while nobody is actively looking out for the particular interests of those books.

===Naming conventions===
The naming convention for &quot;book categories&quot; versus &quot;subject categories&quot; has struck me as slightly kludgy, and combing through this thread should turn up quite a litany of problems with it &amp;mdash; ways that it can facilitate errors &amp;mdash; but that's not about subjects versus bookshelves, it's about names of ''categories''.  We could &quot;easily&quot; change the naming convention; it would only take an appallingly huge amount of start-up work.  For example, we could say that the book category name is the book name with {{nowrap|&quot; (book pages)&quot;}} added at the end, which is something that {{tlx|BookCat}} could be made to do automatically (with an appallingly huge amount of pedestrian work, probably to create new categories under the new names before changing the template, to recategorize pages that don't use BookCat, and finally to delete the old categories once they're empty).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 14:47, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

Postscript:  An example of a possibly-more-useful alternative naming scheme for book categories would be to prefix &lt;s&gt;&quot;Pages/&quot;&lt;/s&gt; &quot;Book/&quot; to the front of the name of the book, so that book&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;World War II&lt;/code&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; would have book category&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Category:Book/World War II&lt;/code&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, and book&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Wikijunior:Solar System&lt;/code&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; would have book category&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Category:Book/Wikijunior:Solar System&lt;/code&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;.  This would preserve the property that the name of the book can be extracted automatically from the name of the book category.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 23:36, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

: I like this idea, as you said it will require a certain amount of startup work, but may be worth it in the long run.  If we decided to do something like this we should make sure to write a description of exactly what so that editors that are long on energy, but short on intellect (like myself ;) ) doe make a mess of it.

::Or a policy could be created requiring titles to be two words or longer so that the conflicts can be avoided in the first place. I do not favor the above proposal because it needlessly complicates things for every book in the wiki in order to accommodate a few exceptions. Big deal if you can't have the prime one-word title that would make your book the de facto leader on the subject.  We've already given the exceptions unique category names and I have no desire to invert the system for the 3000 books in the wiki.

::: I agree. I'd like to go even further and make it against policy to use any subject name as the title of a book. If for no other reason than to prevent a sense of favoritism for one book over others when multiple books can co-exist on a subject.

::::The issue of book/subject name coincidence strikes me (now that it's presented this way) as a distraction from that of book-category naming conventions; I'll address the latter in a separate comment.  While I'm being distracted too, though, I'll remark that
::::* short book names are inherently desirable, though of course clarity is too, so one-word book names are good when they are clear (which includes not causing confusion due to being the same as the name of a subject category... if indeed that actually causes confusion).
::::* if a book has the same name as a category, it isn't obvious to me that that would ''necessarily'' be a problem; in many cases it might be a problem, but why assume that it would always be so?  Seems like it ought to be up to the community to decide whether any given case is a problem, and if so, which of the two ought to be renamed &amp;mdash; since it also isn't obvious to me that, in case of both having the same name, it is ''necessarily'' right to force the book to change its name to accommodate the choice of subject name.  Perhaps one should not be allowed to create a book with the name of a ''pre-existing'' subject, or vice versa, without first getting the community's okay to do so (or, conceivably, permission to rename the pre-existing entity).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:15, 10 July 2009 (UTC)

:::::Right now there's a conflict with [[Subject:Algebra]] and [[Subject:Geometry]] and the books of the same name. Which needs to be renamed?

::::::Interesting cases in point.  Giving a book a title that's the same as the natural name of a subject does imply that the book covers, at least in overview, the entire subject.  Whether that can sometimes be okay... is murky to me.  On these specific cases:  Book&amp;nbsp; &lt;code&gt;Algebra&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp; appears (on admittedly cursory inspection) to be actually a book about&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|[[w:elementary algebra]]}}, in which case its title is misleading and it ought to be renamed to&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Elementary Algebra&lt;/code&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;.  Book&amp;nbsp; &lt;code&gt;Geometry&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp; is an at least somewhat different case, because its outline suggests that it is actually ''intended'' to cover the entire scope of the subject.  Choosing a natural title for it would seem to require first resolving the question of what its scope should be.  Does it aspire to be an overview of the whole subject?  Does it aspire to ''fully cover'' the entire subject?  Is it ever appropriate for a book to try to fully cover its entire subject, and if so, would that turn it into a different kind of entity, something ''other'' than an book (as Taku speaks of in the [[#Is Wikibooks growing?]] thread, putting one in mind of the Cookbook)?  Should the scope of the&amp;nbsp; &lt;code&gt;Geometry&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp; book be narrowed, and if so, to what?  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 17:08, 10 July 2009 (UTC)

::::::: I think an overview of a subject is not really enough to be a book. A book can include an overview of a subject, but to consists of only an overview, I think that is what Wikipedia is for. I think trying to cover everything might be problematic. People will have different opinions on the amount of detail that is required to cover everything, and what order things must be covered in order to properly cover everything. The organization of the book will constantly have to change to reflect an increase in coverage and an increase in material. In other words I think having too broad a scope can be just as problematic as too narrow a scope. I don't think too narrow or too broad a scope can be defined, but rather judged to be so on a case by case bases. With printed books, if a book becomes too big in the eyes of the publisher it either gets cut down to size or turned into a series of books or volumes. To get back on track a little bit though, if Geometry is intended to have a broad scope, to borrow an euphuism from some other books, it could be called &lt;tt&gt;Geometry Noob To Pro&lt;/tt&gt;. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:46, 10 July 2009 (UTC)

:::::::: First, as a side point, let me say that I think I may have a different definition of the word overview.  I would say that most books in mathematics are mostly an overview of the subject they are interested in and skip the finer details to be left to more advanced texts (or future research). Some subjects are necessarily an overview, such as the History of Mathematics.  Where you are compelled to discuss all of the relevant periods, but one is usually prevented from going into too much detail.  

:::::::: I support single word book names.  If it were named something like &lt;tt&gt;Noob to Pro&lt;/tt&gt; you would attract fewer editors to work on it.  Simply put I believe that Geometry is an appropriately named book.  And, no offense intended to anyone here, but who are we to redefine the scope of the book?  As anyone here contributed to it seriously? Or even beyond categorization?  Do any of us intend to write on the subject proper after we redefine the book to have a scope that fits our categorization schemes? 

:::::::: Finally I have a side question.  Is it official policy for books to have their sub-pages in some category?  I didn't find reference to it, but it occurs to me that some issues may be resolved if the pages of a book simply didn't need to appear in a category.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 08:12, 11 July 2009 (UTC)

::::::::: Yes, this was my intention when I used the word overview; I've wondered if perhaps the word survey would have been a more effective choice for my purpose.

::::::::: The name of book&amp;nbsp; &lt;code&gt;Geometry&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp; has two sub-issues:  Is the scope of the book inappropriate (because if so then the title is too); and if the scope is appropriate, is the title ''still'' inappropriate?

:::::::::* I do think, in fact, that the scope of the book is entirely appropriate as-is.  The outline covers more basic stuff in depth, and more briefly covers advanced topics, which is a pattern I recognize from any number of my own college textbooks.  On the more general question of the community tampering with the scope of individual books, well, yeah, ''with sufficient cause'', and with procedural safeguards; happens all the time over at [[WB:VfD]].  We're just brainstorming here (I think), and in fact I for one don't see sufficient cause; as I said, the scope of the book looks entirely appropriate to me.  Changing the title requires somewhat less dire cause, I think, though still, surely, procedural safeguards (and we're still just brainstorming... I think).

:::::::::* Given that the scope of the book really is ''geometry'' as a whole, the possibly valid reason for changing the title would be, I suppose, that it doesn't sufficiently express the content of the book.  There is another book called [[Geometry for elementary school]]; perhaps a title that makes clear the level of the intended audience?  Note that this is not an accidental consequence of the names chosen for categories, but rather an essential consequence of wanting the title of the book to clearly convey what's in the book.

::::::::: All pages of a book go in a &quot;book category&quot;, whose purpose is exactly to hold the pages of the book, because otherwise it would be much harder to keep track of things on both a book- and project-wide scale.  (For one thing, if all non-main book pages were uncategorized, [[Special:UncategorizedPages]] would be virtually useless.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 11:43, 11 July 2009 (UTC)

=== I propose... ===
*As a top level page, we would have a page called [[Wikibooks:Library]]. This page would list sections and sub-sections like the page, [[Wikibooks:Departments]] does.
*Next would be sections (like Departments)
:*Technology
:*Science
:*etc.
*Within that would be subjects (book-shelves) and sub-sections (a new addition).
:*Science
::*Science/Astronomy (sub-section)
::*Science/Biology (sub-section)
::*Subject:Chemistry (subject)
::*etc.

Within the subjects are the books.

This seems like it would work very well.

Thanks. [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 00:49, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

: I'm fine with having a page like Library to replace the departments page. I disagree with having departments and sub-sections.
: The problem with having departments is that lead to confusion in the organization of books due to name overlaps with other parts of the system. Take [[Wikibooks:Social sciences department]] and [[Wikibooks:Social sciences bookshelf]] as an example. The system is better off being simplified where no overlaps in names is possible and where books that are of a general and broad nature can be placed higher up in the organizational system, as is the case already with subjects and categories. With the departments and bookshelf setup people can add books to the department pages instead rather then placing them on the intended page.
: The problem with sub-sections are that topics can be part of more then one subject area. Take Logic for example. I don't think there should be pages called Science/Logic, Computer_Science/Logic, Mathematics/Logic, Computer_Programming/Logic, Electrical_Engineering/Logic, Software_Engineering/Logic, etc.
: I think the departments and bookshelves system is an example of the [http://www.communitywiki.org/en/LimitsOfHierarchies Limits Of Hierarchies] and why [http://www.communitywiki.org/en/HierarchyConsideredHarmful Hierarchy (is) Considered Harmful]. I think readers and new contributors have noticed this problem for years because of discussions that have popped up from time to time on various discussion pages. Having Sub-sections would only add to that problem.
: There are better [http://www.communitywiki.org/en/AlternativesToHierarchy Alternatives To Hierarchy], such as [http://infosthetics.com/archives/2009/02/related_pages_visualizing_the_proximity_of_content_online.html Visualizing The Proximity of Contents], [http://www.communitywiki.org/en/TreeVsSemiLattice Trees VS Semi-Lattice], [http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?TreeMap TreeMap], [[w:Reduction (complexity)|Complexity reduction]], and so on.
: What a lot of the alternatives to hierarchy have in common is overlapping sets or intersections are possible which allows for more accuracy in defining how things relate to each other, there are multiple paths or ways to get to the same information which means a person can often find what they need without backtracking or having to familiarize themselves with how specialists in a field classify things first, and don't need other organizational systems in place to keep it organized which IMO defeats the purpose of an organizational system if it needs another one to make sense of it and to navigate it. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:45, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

: Barnstars are part of the community personality of Wikipedia.  The vast size of Wikipedia both helps makes barnstars work and creates a real need for the sort of community cohesion that they build.  The great uniformity of task on Wikipedia is also key in allowing barnstars to serve that function, and further heightens the individually oppressive and collectively community-decohering effect of the size.

: Wikibooks is a much smaller place with a small-town atmosphere, and also lacks the extreme uniformity.  The nature of the tasks here is inherently more diverse and free-form.  Further, I think the community is largely subdivided into micro-communities, each concerned with a single book or small set of books, and another micro-community of folks who work on project-wide stuff.  Although in some ways reminiscent of Wikipedia's WikiProjects, these micro-communities have more strongly disjoint jurisdictions.  The diversity of Wikibooks tends to have natural [[w:Cleavage (politics)|cleavage]] between books.

== Short Cut to Book ==

What do you guys think about having shortcuts to books?  Here's why I want to do it.  Next week I am going to an International Pathfinder Camporee in Oshkosh, WI, USA.  There will be 33,000 Pathfinders there, all of whom are the target audience for my book, [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]].  I was thinking I would like to print up a bunch of business cards promoting the book, but the URL for it is just huge: 

:http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Adventist_Youth_Honors_Answer_Book

I'm thinking a shortcut might serve the book a little better:
:http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/AYHonors

I can fit ''that'' on a business card, no problem.  When I started working on this book nearly five years ago (it has been a long time!) I read the naming policy which stated something along the lines of &quot;no abbreviations in the name.&quot;  I dutifully followed the directive.  But man - that sure makes for a long URL. I'm not looking to rename the book - just to make it easier to share with others. Thoughts? --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 03:26, 7 August 2009 (UTC)

:I don't have any objections to that.  Aren't there redirects already in place for the Old Dominion University books?  Plus, you've got all the WB: shortcuts as well.

Since you are putting that information in a business card a better alternative would be using the one of the freely available url shortcut tools (I've consistently made use of notlong.com , it puts the url fully under your control and you can even have statistics about it's use, that can be useful if you decide to repeat the idea you will have some metrics to support the concept, or even enable you, later on, to redirect it a more directed page on your userspace)...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:09, 7 August 2009 (UTC)

Well, I doubt this redirect will end up pointing at the wrong place but academically it is a good point.  I am going to suggest/implement the following idea.  Orphaned redirects that are not likely to be searched for are often deleted.  A policy I support and I try to frequently tag unnecessary redirects.  As part of this conversation we should link [[AYHonors]], so if anyone checks the &quot;What links here&quot; for the redirect they will be pointed to this conversation and see the reason why this redirect exists. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:On putting the page in a category, I would say no.  I've consistently removed categories from redirect pages, since they do not appear in any listings of uncategorized pages if they lack categories.  They also distract from real pages in the category listing and deceive by making it appear that there are more books than there are.

== Finding things ==

:''This started out as a prospective contribution to the &quot;Is Wikibooks growing?&quot; thread; but while that would have worked when that thread was near the bottom of the page and active, it wouldn't work so well now that it's far up on the page and inactive.  Also, while some of this is very Big Picture, some of it is also pretty specific.  So when I finally got it whipped into presentable shape, I decided to post it under a fresh thread.''

During the great purge, when most of the physical card catalogs (in technologically advanced parts of the word, anyway) were destroyed, it was noted that good physical card catalogs contained valuable information that was not being captured by the electronic systems that replaced them.  Electronic string searches are so clearly doing something that can't be done on masses of hardcopy, that in our excitement over these new abilities, we were apt to overlook what they ''can't'' do:  they can't provide thoughtful insight into the semantic content of the text.  You'd think that was obvious, except that evidently it wasn't.  Anyway, the sort of thoughtful insight that was lost when the card catalogs were destroyed, is being recreated for Wikipedia in the form of disambiguation pages, hatnotes, and redirects.  It's getting to the point where, when you enter a search on Wikipedia, if you get back a search page it's ''disappointing'', because that requires you to do all the thinking, whereas a disambiguation page or the like would have taken care of some of the tedious meta-level thinking in advance.

But Wikibooks doesn't allow its customers to bypass the overhead of meta-level thinking:  here, the alternatives to a string search &amp;mdash; categories, bookshelves, subject pages &amp;mdash; are all ''classification systems'', less chaotic but not necessarily less effortful than deciding what to do with the results of a string search.

I'll put a pin in that for a moment, and explain why it may be a key issue in the future success of Wikibooks.

'''Potential contributors.'''
As an alternative to the beguiling &quot;stupid and lazy&quot; model of typical potential contributors, suppose they are ''smart and distracted''.  People are a valuable resource for Wikimedia projects ''because'' they're smart (smartness being never more evident than when people are making &quot;stupid&quot; mistakes:  computers don't make stupid mistakes, they make mindless mistakes).  As for ''distracted'', people have other things going on in their lives besides contributing for free to Wikimedia projects.

Recognizing that people have limited time for Wikimedia projects leads to a ''[[w:The Long Tail|long tail]]'' model of project contributions.  Long tails are what makes amazon.com and Netflix work:  Of all the potential sales, a significant fraction of them are potential sales of items that have individually very little demand (obscure books, obscure movies).  If there were even a small overhead expense to serving those low-demand items, then it wouldn't be economic to serve them at all; but if a way can be found to avoid attaching even a very small overhead to them, then the total area under that part of the curve (that is, the area under the long tail of the curve) could make all the difference in viability of the enterprise as a whole.

To apply the long tail mathematical model here, consider contributions to the project of a certain size.  Individual items (points on the ''x'' axis) are particular potential contributors, and &quot;demand&quot; (height of the curve on the ''y'' axis) is how much effort they're willing to put into it.  The first time someone comes to Wikibooks, they probably haven't already been convinced that it's worth a lot of effort to hunt for the right book; so if we want to hang on to them as they wander past us on the Internet, we need to make it ''really easy'' for them to find something that will interest them.  Give them a search box such that no matter what they type in, they're likely to get back something coherent, at least akin to a WP disambiguation page.  If we ask them to follow a treasure map through a classification system, ''some'' of them will do that, but the long-tail theory says that there are lots and lots of people out there who won't put in that much effort, yet who, if we had only managed to snag them on that first encounter, would have gotten more and more involved with the project over time.  The loss to the project ''per person'' might be tiny, but if there were a million of them (or ten million (or a hundred million)), the cumulative loss to the project would be significant.

''After'' we manage to hook them on that first encounter, they will hopefully have a higher opinion of the project, and will therefore subsequently be willing to invest a little more, so they become potential investors for a slightly larger purchase, such as making a small edit to a book.  And so on.  That's how Wikipedia picks up contributors:  by making it really easy to get started, and then really easy to get a little more involved, and fairly easy to get a little more involved, and moderately straightforward to get a little more involved.  At each stage in the process, you're dealing with people who have been convinced, by earlier stages, that it's worth investing just a little more than they had before.  The base of the pyramid, that everything else is predicated on, is the potential users who come to the project for the first time with no prior experience of it.  Even a very small burden placed on those first-time users could cut off a lot of the long tail.  The long-term viability of the project can depend on how many keyclicks and mouse clicks &amp;mdash; and neuron firings &amp;mdash; it takes for the first-time user to find what they want.

Of course all these other things we've been discussing lately &amp;mdash; bookshelves and subject pages, and categories, and FlaggedRevs, and what-not &amp;mdash; are important [[w:Blind men and an elephant|parts of the elephant]] too.  But they're further up the pyramid.

'''Keyword search.'''
Okay, that brings me back to the pin I stuck in the question of how to find things.

First, what should the search facility ''look like''?  How about this:  a dialog box that one can type a short description of a topic into, and expect to get back a well-targeted, convenient list of relevant books.  (That's in contrast to the search box we now have at Wikibooks, which ''never'' gives back a well-targeted convenient list of relevant books:  it either takes us directly to a book, or it gives us back a mechanically prioritized dump of search matches.)

* Should the result of a query ''always'' be a list of targets, or should it sometimes take you directly to a target page (book main page or book section page)?  The potential difficulty in going directly to a target is that, unlike Wikipedia, we don't have hatnotes at the tops of our pages; so if there are other pages that are also related, that information won't be made readily available.  I'll assume for how that a query result is always a list of targets.

* Should the targets resulting from a query be only book main pages, or should they include section pages as well?

* To be really useful, the list of targets returned by a query should be sorted, at least crudely, by completion &amp;mdash; stubs clearly marked as such, for example, so that people aren't unpleasantly surprised when they click on the link and there's essentially nothing there; that would be a turn-off, and we want the first-time Wikibooks user's experience to be ''positive''.

The second big question is, how should these query-result pages be generated?

* I submit that they cannot be directly generated by hand.  Wikipedia generates disambiguation pages and redirects and hatnotes all by hand, but there the targets are essentially simple and static, and even creation of new articles largely follows predictable patterns.  At Wikibooks our targets have much more complex structure &amp;mdash; that being a large part of what differentiates a book from a set of articles &amp;mdash; and contributors are apt to concentrate wholly on the content of individual books, so that overhead on remote pages (like bookshelves or subject pages) is apt to be underattended.  And if we have trouble paying enough attention to bookshelves and subject pages, just imagine how much worse the problem would be if we had a hundred or a thousand times as many such pages to worry about; that's not gonna happen.

* The query-results have to reflect a process that had some thought put into it somewhere, so since that thought doesn't occur at the query-result itself, presumably that means the thought has to be distributed amongst the targets themselves.  Academic papers routinely have a list of &quot;keywords&quot; after the abstract; perhaps we could use something similar.  Very careful thought is needed ''in advance'' to just what kind of &quot;keywords&quot; we're going to put on the individual pages, because it would be a right mess to change our minds ''after'' distributed creation of these keyword lists is already underway.

* Part of figuring out what should be provided in the way of distributed &quot;keyword&quot; information, is figuring out what transformation should be performed on that information to automatically generate query-result pages.

* Separate from figuring out the transformation, is figuring out ''how to implement'' the transformation.  I have a (sinking) feeling that javascript would be involved, at least initially, but since I've managed to avoid studying javascript to date, for now that's just a feeling.  In any event, choosing the transformation is much more immediately important, because creating the distributed information depends on grokking the transformation rather than its implementation, and once the information is available it's always possible to try different implementations.

== Linking ideas ==

Hello--I'm a fairly experienced Wikipedia editor, just coming to Wikibooks. I was constructing my user page when I ran into the problem that I wanted to be able to link terms (such as [[behavioral economics]]) to their Wikipedia entries, and didn't know if there was a simple way to do so (rather than including an HTML link).

...but then, looking around I see that hyperlinks aren't the norm here at Wikibooks? Is the aim to produce books that would work best on paper? My bias is to include links to concepts which could use more elaboration than they'll get in the book text.

So, the question in my mind started as technical, but rapidly moved to design--what's the Wikibooks philosophy toward links? [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 11:23, 21 August 2009 (UTC)

:And [[Help:Editing#Links]] at least partially answers both of the above, with the technical (such as [[w:behavioral economics]]) and the norm, &quot;''be conservative in linking to pages outside the book (and especially so to pages outside Wikibooks)''&quot;. If there's a place which argues the ''why'' of this standard, that would also be helpful to me. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 11:28, 21 August 2009 (UTC)

:You also may want to look at [[Help:Wikibooks for Wikimedians]] since you're coming from Wikipedia for some other differences in culture.

: Producing books that can be easily printed is important to some people, though that isn't the sole reason. A part of Wikibooks' philosophy is that books should be self-contained. If you think the definition of a term is important for understanding a book's subject, you should include the term's definition within the book. Some books have glossaries and link important terms to the book's glossary. Some books introduce the definition of an important terms the first time the term is used, and style the term with italic or bold. Basically adding material is encouraged, and using links to compensate for lack of material is discouraged. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:33, 21 August 2009 (UTC)

== When to RFI ==

Hello--I'm working on starting a new book and want to provide guidance to other new editors, as well as figuring things out myself. I figure sometimes we'd want to copy a large amount of material from a Wikipedia article, sometimes just a little. Sometimes we'd want to copy a lot, but not necessarily all into the same chapter of the book.

I'm wondering what guidelines there are for when to [[WB:RFI|RFI]], and when to copy &amp; paste. Additionally, are there any special concerns on how to handle the material once it's in Wikibooks? If it's to be included in a chapter, but the chapter isn't primarily derivative of the Wikipedia page, how is that handled?

Thanks [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 21:17, 21 August 2009 (UTC)

:You can sporadically copy paste a phrase here and there without any attribution (this is valid for any work). From WIkimedia sources, the [[WB:RFI|RFI]] is normally the preferred method, since it preserves the edit history and using it skips the otherwise   requirement of having to state on the book that some content came from a external Wikimedia project. (Wikisource material should always be referenced directly).      --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:39, 21 August 2009 (UTC)

::Thanks, Panic, and also for the welcome note. I'm going follow up some more on this, since I'm feeling dense. So, if I wanted to include a little material from Wikipedia's [[w:information economics|information economics]] page, I would [[WB:RFI|RFI]], but the new thing wouldn't be part of my book, would it? Instead it would be a free-floating page here at Wikibooks? And then, as a free-floating page here at Wikibooks, any material could be copied from it without worrying about notices that some material came from Wikipedia...?

::On the other hand, if even a little material came from Wikipedia, an notice about that would be required--would the notice have to be more detailed if using more material, or is it binary?

:::When you request a import, the source page is copied with it's edit history. You can then edit and move it into the book. It would then became part of your book, not a free-floating page (those exist, [[The World of Peer-to-Peer (P2P)/GnuFU|I have adopted some over the time]], when those requesting the RFI doesn't complete the job, most free-floating pages resulting from abandoned RFI would be proper targets for s speedy deletion (if enough time has passed).

::::Oof, I was thinking this would be easy. I'm starting to think it's actually tricky. So, suppose I have a pre-existing chapter and I want to copy a chunk of material from a WP article into that chapter. So, I can't just RFI the article and use that as a starting point for the WB page. If I RFI the article, copy stuff from the WB version of the article to the WB chapter, then the article is deleted from WB, then the RFI was for naught. On the other hand, I could import the article into the book, but then it's like a legal vestigial organ, not something I really want in the book, just there to keep an edit history around. Is there a standard way to approach such a situation?

::::Can you point me to an example of the kind of attribution that's used if stuff is copied from WP without an RFI? (Thanks for your patience.) [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 01:02, 22 August 2009 (UTC)

:::::You do a RFI and then merge the content you wish to keep, ask an history merge to your chapter fallowed by a deletion of the imported page (not very complicated).

== [[Creating a web application]] ==

This book looks nothing like a book; more like an article. Should it be transwikied? [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ([[User talk:Kayau|talk]]) 05:00, 21 July 2009 (UTC)

:An excellent question, and a tricky one.  We certainly have many books that do not look like books.  Also, some of the books that do look like books, do not seem to be textbooks to me.  It is not quite appropriate for wikipedia, because the page plans to instruct you how do something.  So it may very well fall under the &quot;instructional guide&quot; phrase of [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks?|What is Wikibooks?]] article. But I would be curious to hear what other people think.

:::In my opinion it needs to be broken down into steps and then written with easier to understand language for people just learning how to build a web application but don't know how. First I would write a chapter on how to use HTML codes and maybe an open source Web designer program (so that it is free and not tied down to one software company), then write a chapter on XML. Then write a chapter on using Javascript and web control forms. Then write a chapter on using Netbeans (because it is a free IDE from Sun to develop web code and other code in) and the PHP language with an Apache web server. Then one tying them all together. Then make a more advanced version of the book with LAMP Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP (or optionally without Linux if case the reader is using Windows or Mac OSX, etc) and more on how to build advanced web applications. Right now it has confusing words and shows code from a PHP application but has no introduction section and seems more like marketing speak for web technologies.

== Some questions about Strategy Guides ==

The article [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks?]] clearly states that &quot;Wikibooks is not for video game strategy guides&quot;.  I was considering nominating the [[Minesweeper]] module for deletion because it seemed to me it aimed to be a strategy guide for a video game.  Then I started to attempt to define for myself it it constitutes a &quot;video game&quot;.  Then I began to wonder why we are singling out one particular type of strategy guide.  Is the page on [[How to solve the Rubik's Cube]] really any different than a page about a specific type of puzzle implemented on  a computer? Should we really make a distinction that a physical model of game can be constructed (the Rubik's cube certainly exists has a computer game as well.)  But this page simply seems to be a strategy guide.

I am not trying to raise points about specific pages, but curious to hear what people think about this wording.  I am hoping someone can set my internal compass straight about why specifically do we disallow '''video game''' strategy guides as opposed instead of all strategy guides. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 08:20, 13 August 2009 (UTC)

: I don't particularly like singling out strategy guides myself. The short version of the history I think is that it all started with some comments/observations made by Jimbo who seemed to be making a distinction between books like DOOM and books like Chess. He seemed to be urging books like DOOM were out of scope because he's never heard of any school that taught people how to play DOOM, while on the other hand schools often have a Chess Club. Jimbo even went as far as to rewrite &quot;What is Wikibooks&quot; to limit Wikibooks' scope to only textbooks, but it didn't quiet stick. Despite some disagreements over the whole thing, Jimbo did manage to influence Wikibooks to some extent, and eventually &quot;Wikibooks is not for video game strategy guides&quot; was added after a few years worth of consensus to delete such books repeatedly passed VFD.

: I think one possible argument that would be used to make the distinction your wondering about is:
:* Puzzles are often used as part of critical thinking exercises, in math challenges, in learning about Logic, etc.
:* You can't take what is learned by following specific strategies to a specific game and apply it to real world problems.

: In any case I think VFD is still the best way to deal with such books, because what qualifies is still not always clear.

: If the criteria was broaden there is a risk of also inadvertently saying that books on [[Game Theory]] and related subjects aren't allowed either. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 10:56, 13 August 2009 (UTC)
== SVG images ==

I see [[Help:Files|Help:Images_and_other_uploaded_files#Supported_file_types.3B_miscellaneous|here]] something about SVG images which isn't entirely clear. Is it trying to say that I can't upload and show new SVG images?

Also, I'm trying to use an SVG [[User:TDang/Quizzes/Quiz01|here]]* and it's displaying odd. Pointers to control over the scaling of images would be appreciated.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; I know that looks like inappropriate use of the wiki--I'm doing it partly for learning and partly because I intend to de-personalize the material there and include it in the book. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 17:18, 26 August 2009 (UTC)

: That help page is very much out of date. SVG files can be uploaded. When a SVG image used a scaled PNG image is created and used in its place because not all web browsers support SVG images. This is done by the software transparently without anyone having to do anything more. There are some bugs in the conversion process though. SVG is preferred because SVG is an open format and anyone can easily download and change SVG images, even with just a text editor if someone wanted to. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:37, 26 August 2009 (UTC)

::Thanks! I was wondering why it was telling me I couldn't use SVG when I clearly was already doing so. Any ideas on the scaling of the image. It looks correct [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/File:Monopoly_pricing_example_01.svg here] and ... um, now it looks right on the page. That's odd, but I guess for the moment it's not a problem. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 17:46, 26 August 2009 (UTC)

::: If you want to scale an image use &lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Image.svg|64x64px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; where &quot;64x64px&quot; means 64 by 64 pixels. If a size isn't specified a default size is used which depends on your [[Special:Preferences|preferences]]. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:28, 26 August 2009 (UTC)

Once that is complete, you mark the page that should no longer exist following the merge with {{tlx|now merged|surviving page name here}}.

== General Question About Donating My Book ==

I'm an independent thinker who has a book on Amazon called &quot;Common Sense II&quot;. I'd like to make it free to everybody but I don't want it edited -- OR -- if my book is edited, then I no longer want to be called its author (particularly if the changes are substantial). My book is a tough controversial strategy to prevent terrorism. But it looks like neither Wikibooks or Wikisource will be suitable. Any ideas of what to do? If so, my thanks in advance.

: If you don't want it edited, then none of the WMF projects are the place for it. Not being labeled as the author of a substantially edited work would however make it appropriate for both Wikisource and Wikibooks.

For Wikibooks, you'll need to release the content (at least) under the Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License 3.0 and the GFDL.

:Wikisource seems the best fit for your goals. Wikisource is a library of static texts that have already been published elsewhere.

:I think you can even submit it to both projects and add a licensing page to the Wikibook stating the original (static) source, this would enable it to continue to evolve here, if you disagree with it's evolution you can freely state that and remove yourself from the authors list. You have to license your work on either project as Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License 3.0 and the GFDL ([http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Wikisource:Copyright not as public domain as [[User:Swift|Swift]] said above], public domain is compatible with both licenses that was probably the reason for the confusion).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:04, 22 August 2009 (UTC)

:: I don't know the particulars but be careful.  If the book is an already published &quot;dead tree&quot; then the company that published it often has some copyright over the text that would prevent you from releasing it into the public domain or publishing with another company without the first company's express written consent.  Make sure to review your contract with the initial publisher.  The one dead tree book I was involved with got caught in this terrible situation where the first publishing company decided books on that subject were not profitable to print, but unwilling to release the book so it could be published with another company.

== Pages in the wrong category? ==

Perhaps I am just confused, so forgive me if this turns out to be a waste of time.  While examining some pages in [[:Category:Queried pages]], I noticed many pages displayed at the bottom of the page that they were in [[:Category:Candidates for speedy deletion]] and not in [[:Category:Queried pages]].  (See for example [[Cochlear implants]]).  This makes sense, as the pages had been queried for more then seven days.  But while the link at the bottom of the page directs you to [[:Category:Candidates for speedy deletion]], the page doesn't appear there.  Instead it appears in [[:Category:Queried pages]], where in theory it shouldn't be.  Even after purging the cache servers the pages, things didn't appear where I might have expected them to. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:59, 19 August 2009 (UTC)

:This same issue comes up when you change the category applied to a page with a template.  The new category shows at the bottom of the page but the page still remains in the old category.  The category you see on the above pages changes due to the parser functions code, but the page still remains in the queried pages category.  If you null edit the page, only then does the category get changed.  Theoretically this would be fixed every time the Special listings get refreshed, but for books I've moved where I didn't null edit all the pages to refresh the pages' categories, I have seen the old category show up in the wanted categories.  This tells me the pages remained in the old category even after the cache refresh.  This is a known issue, but pages I've seen on it state that it should fix itself given time.  I'm not sure this is always the case.  The one sure way to fix it is to null edit the page. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:19, 19 August 2009 (UTC)

Good to know, I hadn't noticed that null edits don't show up in the edit history.  I was mistakenly under the impression that this would case the page to end up back in queried pages for 7 more days. Good to know it is a known issue, hope it gets fixed someday.[[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:19, 20 August 2009 (UTC)

== Template:Wrongname ==

Is there a variation for {{[[Template:Wrongname|Wrongname]]}} template ? Is it still necessary for the # character ?&lt;br&gt;
I noted that the [[C Sharp Programming]] was renamed [[C# Programming]]. (I've attempted the same to the page and it doesn't work)&lt;br&gt;
I was editing [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Comparisons/C Sharp]] and noticed that the template states &quot;The title given to this book page is incorrect due to technical limitations. The correct title is C#.&quot; (since it is a page not a book). Need some input on this before I &lt;s&gt;attempt a page move or&lt;/s&gt; have to tackle the template.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:56, 20 August 2009 (UTC)

:[[C Sharp Programming]] is only at that title.  You're looking at what's displayed at the top of the page with [[Template:Displaytitle]].  Click the link you made to [[C# Programming]].  It goes to [[C]], a redirect to [[Subject:C programming language]].  This is because the &quot;title#blah&quot; convention in HTML goes to a named anchor &quot;blah&quot; on the page named &quot;title&quot;.  For instance, [[C Sharp Programming/Naming#Interfaces]] takes you to the Interfaces section of [[C_Sharp_Programming/Naming]].  # will never be a valid character in a URL as it has special meaning in a link. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:26, 20 August 2009 (UTC)

::Yup. Didn't verify, and assumed it was a redirect. (I didn't know about {{[[Template:Displaytitle|Displaytitle]]}} nor did I noticed it before, txs).&lt;br&gt;
::I've fixed the issue with the {{[[Template:Wrongname|Wrongname]]}} template, it seems that was the last page using it, probably tagging the template for deletion would be the next step (since the other offers a simpler solution)...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:44, 20 August 2009 (UTC)

== Proposed additions ==

...with apologies if this is not the correct venue, the following:
:(1) The creation/addition of a &quot;Basic Math&quot; text with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
:(2) the addition of practice problems to all suitable texts; something I would be willing to collaberate on, but lack the technical know-how to initiate.  

I would like my son to be able to learn math from addition to differential equations exclusively via wikibooks, but the very first steps of that process appear to be missing.  Thanks for your thoughts.  [[User:PCAndrew|PCAndrew]] ([[User talk:PCAndrew|talk]]) 15:50, 29 August 2009 (UTC)

:By ''Basic Math'', it sounds as if you're talking about what I would call ''Arithmetic''.  I think something along those lines might make an excellent addition to [[Wikijunior]].  {{nowrap|&quot;Wikijunior:Arithmetic&quot;?}}  (The one math volume now listed on the Wikijunior main page is [[Geometry for Elementary School]], which oddly enough isn't even a Wikijunior book.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 17:37, 29 August 2009 (UTC)

== Translation of an exitsting Wikibook ==

I am planning, as far as time permits, to translate the German Wikibook [[de:Formelsammlung_Physik/_Kernwaffenexplosion]] to English for en.wikibooks. As I am one of the main contributors there should be no languague issues. However, I do not know how to copy the version history or at least the author's information (which is required by both the GFDL and the CC license) into the new book, since there have been other contributors by the time. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any helpful information on the Wikibooks help pages. Many thanks in advance!--[[User:SiriusB|SiriusB]] ([[User talk:SiriusB|talk]]) 16:25, 27 August 2009 (UTC)

:When I copied a book written in Russian to the Russian Wikibooks, I also copied and pasted the page history log onto the talk page at the destination for the GFDL.  You could also simply add a link to the version of the German page used which would satisfy the CC license.  Either of those appear to satisfy the [http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use terms of use].  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:38, 27 August 2009 (UTC)

== geology of Indonesia ==

: ''Moved from [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Feature requests]]''

i have gone through the wonderful effort of &quot;Geology of Indonesia&quot;. I cannot, however, understand the practice of refering to figure numbers when there are no referred figures and referring to authors when there is no list of references or bibliography. Is it because of insufficience of time or space or it has something to do with copyright?

== Request for new WikiBook - Magical Moments Around the World ==

Hi,

My name is Gal and I'm the founder and organizer of a global educational project called '''Magical Moments Around the World'''.

Magical Moments Around the World is a uniting of youth all over the world sharing their magical moments in a global online book for generations to come.. A global online book written by people for people. A testimonial to the great human spirit that connects us all. And just like the sun shines on us all it portrays a human spirit that's within us all.

In its essence the project aims to provide every child in the world the right to be aware that we are all connected and part of one big human family. This is done by writing magical moments in a global online book on an ongoing basis for generations to come. Students can also interact and upload videos, photos, drawings and other creative work using the collaboration center.

Showing youth that their personal magical moment is part of a human web that transcends borders, continents, race, religion and gender is of incredible human value. And promotes values such as compassion and tolerance.
Currently youth from 14 countries have posted their magical moments and can be viewed on the magical moment website at [http://www.magicalmoment.net/EN/mm.htm] 

I wanted to ask if it would be possible to integrate the Magical Moment online book as a WikiBook, thus opening it up to the world - creating the biggest book humanity has ever known. And have it run, edited and translated into many different languages by volunteers.

I would be happy to elaborate and hope that we can all work together.
For more information visit the website at:
[http://www.magicalmoment.net/EN] 

Best wishes to all,

If you add the licensing information to the PDFs you've already created or the website where they are hosted, people can copy them straight over to Wikibooks.

Your goals are certainly in line with the environment here, as collaboration and editing by many people is encouraged at Wikibooks. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:13, 21 August 2009 (UTC)

Dear Adrignola. Thanks for replying. I think Wikibooks is certainly inline with the Magical Moments online book in that it's written for the people by the people.
I have several questions:
1. How would I go about setting up the book?
2. Where can I find volunteers to help in editing and translating to different languages?
3. How do I insure the book is kept clean of vandalism or hurtful remarks?

: Sorry, but this page is for discussing Wikibooks projects, not to request answers to various questions. You can try [[WB:SEARCH|searching]] for a topic here on Wikibooks or the wider Internet. [[w:Wikipedia|Wikipedia]] also has a place for such questions, but you could also just ask a teacher if you are at school, or ask for help finding a conventional book in a local library. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 18:27, 26 August 2009 (UTC)

== Telescope Making and other orphans ==

The book [[Telescope_Making|Telescope Making]] is intriguing. It has interesting information presented in a charmingly informal, first-person tone. However, it could use copy-editing for syntax and easier reading, as well as better organization. And of course, it is incomplete, leaving the would-be telescope maker with a mirror and nothing to put it in. Before doing anything to this book I thought I should at least talk to the original author. Yeah, this is a wiki, anybody can edit anything, blah-di-blah, but that book is clearly the work of a single voice who might have a proprietorial interest, and deserves the courtesy of a nod.

Unfortunately, that person, user &quot;Vorblesnak,&quot; has essentially disappeared from the intertubes. Googling reveals some activity by him in various fora (some of which included his real name and city of residence) but nothing recent, and the mail address {{email|vorblesnak|peak.org}} bounces as &quot;user suspended.&quot; A website apparently set up by him can be seen as a Google cache but is apparently offline.

Is there a general policy or approach to dealing with orphan books or missing users? Or does the application of the Wiki Way mean that people come, people go, and books sit until someone works on them? [[User_talk:Fernly|Fernly]] &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|undated]] comment was added 20:53, 28 August 2009.&lt;/small&gt;

:There isn't a policy or even a generalized approach besides the [[Wikibooks:Be bold]] guide. To avoid any issues, if you intend to do some major contributions, post a note in the book talk page, express your views and if anything can seem controversial (ie: merge content from/with other books) use any applicable tag and give it 7 days for an opposition to materialize if no one cares then you can do as you will (except deleting any useful content, see if it fits elsewere) in doubt tag any page for VFD and the rest of the community will give it's input.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:41, 28 August 2009 (UTC)

What!? Can't a man take a sabbatical?  I had hoped by leaving gaps in the text to get someone else to add to the book. I don't think anyone would argue that I am not the encyclopedia of telescope making. The book is finished, I just have not posted all the chapters. I really would like some other input but it does not look like the book will get done unless I finish it. Tis sad.

You think breaking it up into many small pages would help? I got no problem with that. If you would like to collaborate and clean it up I think that would be good. Are you going to contribute the missing chapters or do you want me to?

Sorry about the email address. I let the old one lapse and then got another when it was closed. You can reach me at ...

== Moving a page ==

How should one go about renaming a book? Does moving the parent page move all subpages as well? Should I move each module seperately? Thanks, &amp;ndash;'''[[user:blurpeace|blurpeace]]''' '''[[user talk:blurpeace|&lt;sup&gt;(talk)&lt;/sup&gt;]]''' 13:08, 29 August 2009 (UTC)

:Non-admins have to move one page at a time.  If there are many pages involved, it might make sense to ask an admin to do it for you, as they can move all the pages of a book at once.

This section discusses techniques and methods to enhance web services security. 

The ''WS-Policy'' has been standardized by the W3C group and has become known as the de facto standard web service policy specifications. There have been a number of proposals to translate the WS-Policy into logic. One such proposal uses OWL-DL to provide formal semantics. Using a reasoner, it provides a mechanism that determines if two policies are compatible. The reasoner used is Pellet which is a standard plug-in for the open-source tool called Protégé available through Stanford University. WS-Policy based files are mapped to OWL-DL based on the idea that service policy assertions are mapped to classes, and web service requestors are mapped to OWL individuals. The reasoner provides a number of services in containment, equivalence, incompatibility, incoherence (nothing can satisfy the policy) and policy conformance, among others. Thus, the mapping allows us to use an off-the-shelf OWL reasoner as a policy engine and analysis tool, and an off-the-shelf OWL editor as a policy development and integration environment. OWL editors can also be used to develop domain specific assertion languages (essentially, domain ontologies) with a uniform syntax and well specified semantics. Policy intersection is also used when a web service requestor and provider want to compute the compatible policy alternatives between them. OWL-DL is a W3C standard, a language with clear syntax and semantics that is ubiquitous in the Semantic Web. The number of reasoners and OWL-DL editors has been growing steadily. A policy language based on OWL-DL can capitalize on the popularity of OWL-DL. The previous examples described would not have been possible had not modifications been done to Pellet. Further, a user interface was developed as part of the project called SWOOP. It can be downloaded at the following URL: http://code.google.com/p/swoop/[1].''

A another method to extend security for web services is use the JAX-WS specification in conjunction with JAX-WS RI. The standard handlers of JAX-WS have some limitations. For example, LogicalHandler provides access to payload only and does not provide access to SOAP headers and binary data carried as attachments in the SOAP Message, and is more suited for XML/HTTP binding. Further, though SOAPHandlers provide access to whole SOAP Message, it has performance implications as SOAPMessage is based on DOM and tries to load the whole message in memory. On the hand, JAX-WS RI reads the message in a streaming fashion and tries to read the information lazily to provide better performance. The JAX-WS specification supports the common WS-I specifications including WS-I Basic Profile, WS-I Attachments Profile, WS-I Simple SOAP Binding Profile 1.0 WS-Addressing - Core, SOAP Binding, and WSDL Binding. JAX-WS RI defines message abstraction— hiding the actual data representation, either the message to be constructed from a JAXB object or InputStream of an HttpConnection. The Message API provides various ways to access the payload and implementations can implement those methods in the best possible way. JAX-WS runtime chooses the right Message representation when it constructs a new message. Further, it provides some commonly used implementations of the Message Base class (e.g., JAXBMessage, DOMMessage, SAAJ Message, and ProtocolSourceMessage). Each of these Message classes has particular characteristics and may be more useful or suited depending on the situation at hand. With the addition of RI, the developer has access to static factory methods to easily create messages with the Messages API. Using this approach, he can easily access and create messages irrespective of the actual data representation. Utilizing the extensible Handler framework provided by the JAX-WS Specification and the better Message abstraction in RI, a new class handler may be introduced a called MessageHandler to extend your web service applications. MessageHandler is similar to SOAPHandler, except the implementations of gets access to MessageHandlerContext (an extension of MessageContext). Through the MessageHandlerContext class, the Message can be accessed and processed by using the Message API&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The problems are somewhat confusing:
# Write an expression that matches the pattern H2 to the reverse of the list [{1,2},{2,1}].
# Write an expression that matches the pattern H3 to the length of the list [{1,2},{2,1}].
# Write an expression that matches the pattern H4 to the length of the flattened version of the list [{1,2},{2,1}].

Problem #1 is easy enough, that information is given in the article.

Problem #2 doesn't say whether they should be counted, or if the &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; should be used. If it's the former, I don't yet have enough information to know how to do this as a reader. If it's the latter, I haven't been introduced to the &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; function. It doesn't appear to be part of the lists module, either.

Problem #3 doesn't describe what is intended by 'flattened version'. Perhaps example output would be good.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Advanced Haskell|noexercises=1}}

In keeping with the non-linear organization of the Advanced Track, we will give two complementary
presentations of arrows. This chapter provides a hands-on tutorial, while the next one,
[[Haskell/Understanding arrows|Understanding arrows]], is a more conceptual introduction. Go
through them in the order that suits you best.

== Stephen's Arrow Tutorial ==

In this tutorial, I will create my own arrow, show how to use the arrow '''proc''' and '''do''' notation,
and show how &lt;code&gt;ArrowChoice&lt;/code&gt; works.
We will end up with a simple game of Hangman.

With the advanced section at the end, this tutorial gives complete coverage of '''proc''' notation.

First, we give a language pragma to enable the arrow do notation in the compiler:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
{-# LANGUAGE Arrows #-}
&lt;/source&gt;

And then, some imports:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
module Main where

import Control.Arrow
import Control.Monad
import qualified Control.Category as Cat
import Data.List
import Data.Maybe
import System.Random
&lt;/source&gt;

Any Haskell function can behave as an arrow, because there is an Arrow instance for the
function type constructor &lt;code&gt;(-&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;. In this tutorial I will build a more interesting arrow
than this, with the ability to maintain state.  This is something that a plain Haskell
function arrow cannot do.  Arrows can, in fact, produce any effects you like, including I/O,
but we won't be getting too carried away.

I will call this arrow &lt;code&gt;Circuit&lt;/code&gt;, just to suggest that it can be helpful to
visualize arrows as circuits.  This is loosely based on the Yampa functional reactive programming library.

== Type definition for 'Circuit' ==

A simple Haskell function treated as an arrow has type &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; b&lt;/code&gt;.
In &lt;code&gt;Circuit&lt;/code&gt;, we add two things to this.  Firstly we wrap it in a &lt;code&gt;newtype&lt;/code&gt;
declaration (needed to cleanly define an Arrow instance), and secondly, along with the
function's output value &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, it also returns a replacement for itself.
This is the mechanism that allows the circuit to maintain its own internal state.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
newtype Circuit a b = Circuit { unCircuit :: a -&gt; (Circuit a b, b) }
&lt;/source&gt;

To make this an arrow, we need to make it an instance of both &lt;code&gt;Category&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Arrow&lt;/code&gt;.
Throughout these definitions, we always replace each &lt;code&gt;Circuit&lt;/code&gt; by the new version
of itself that it has returned.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance Cat.Category Circuit where
    id = Circuit $ \a -&gt; (Cat.id, a)
    (.) = dot
      where
        (Circuit cir2) `dot` (Circuit cir1) = Circuit $ \a -&gt;
            let (cir1', b) = cir1 a
                (cir2', c) = cir2 b
            in  (cir2' `dot` cir1', c)
&lt;/source&gt;

The Cat.id function replaces itself with a copy of itself, without maintaining any state.  The
purpose of the &lt;code&gt;(.)&lt;/code&gt; function is to chain two arrows together from right to left.  &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;/code&gt; are
based on &lt;code&gt;(.)&lt;/code&gt;.  It needs to replace itself with the `dot` of the two replacements returned by
the execution of the argument Circuits.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance Arrow Circuit where
    arr f = Circuit $ \a -&gt; (arr f, f a)
    first (Circuit cir) = Circuit $ \(b, d) -&gt;
        let (cir', c) = cir b
        in  (first cir', (c, d))
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;arr&lt;/code&gt; lifts a plain Haskell function as an arrow.  Like with &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;, the replacement it
gives is just itself, since a plain Haskell function can't maintain state.

Now we need a function to run a circuit:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
runCircuit :: Circuit a b -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
runCircuit _   []     = []
runCircuit cir (x:xs) =
    let (cir',x') = unCircuit cir x
    in  x' : runCircuit cir' xs
&lt;/source&gt;

For &lt;code&gt;mapAccumL&lt;/code&gt; fans like me, this can alternatively be written as

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
runCircuit :: Circuit a b -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
runCircuit cir inputs =
    snd $ mapAccumL (\cir x -&gt; unCircuit cir x) cir inputs
&lt;/source&gt;

or, after eta-reduction, simply as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
runCircuit :: Circuit a b -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
runCircuit cir inputs = snd $ mapAccumL unCircuit cir inputs
&lt;/source&gt;

== 'Circuit' primitives ==

Let's define a generalized accumulator, which will be the basis of everything else
we do.  &lt;code&gt;accum'&lt;/code&gt; is a less general version of &lt;code&gt;accum&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- | Accumulator that outputs a value determined by the supplied function.
accum :: acc -&gt; (a -&gt; acc -&gt; (b, acc)) -&gt; Circuit a b
accum acc f = Circuit $ \input -&gt;
    let (output, acc') = input `f` acc
    in  (accum acc' f, output)

-- | Accumulator that outputs the accumulator value.
accum' :: b -&gt; (a -&gt; b -&gt; b) -&gt; Circuit a b
accum' acc f = accum acc (\a b -&gt; let b' = a `f` b in (b', b'))
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is a useful concrete accumulator which keeps a running total of all the numbers
passed to it as inputs.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
total :: Num a =&gt; Circuit a a
total = accum' 0 (+)
&lt;/source&gt;

We can run this circuit, like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
*Main&gt; runCircuit total [1,0,1,0,0,2]
[1,1,2,2,2,4]
*Main&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Arrow 'proc' notation ==

Here is a statistical mean function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
mean1 :: Fractional a =&gt; Circuit a a
mean1 = (total &amp;&amp;&amp; (const 1 ^&gt;&gt; total)) &gt;&gt;&gt; arr (uncurry (/))
&lt;/source&gt;

It maintains two accumulator cells, one for the sum,
and one for the number of elements.  It splits the input using the 'fanout' operator
&lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; and before the input of the second stream, it discards the input value and
replaces it with 1.

&lt;code&gt;const 1 ^&gt;&gt; total&lt;/code&gt; is shorthand for &lt;code&gt;arr (const 1) &gt;&gt;&gt; total&lt;/code&gt;.
The first stream is the sum of the inputs.  The second stream is the sum of 1 for
each input (i.e. a count of the number of inputs).  Then, it merges the two streams with a &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; operator.

Here is the same function, but written using arrow 'do' notation:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
mean2 :: Fractional a =&gt; Circuit a a
mean2 = proc value -&gt; do
    t &lt;- total -&lt; value
    n &lt;- total -&lt; 1
    returnA -&lt; t / n
&lt;/source&gt;

The 'do' notation describes the same relationship between the arrows, but in a totally different way.
Instead of explicitly describing the wiring, you glue the arrows together using variable bindings
and pure Haskell expressions, and the compiler works out all the &lt;code&gt;arr, &gt;&gt;&gt;, &amp;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; stuff
for you.  Arrow 'do' notation also contains a pure 'let' statement exactly like the monadic one.

'''proc''' is the keyword that introduces arrow notation, and it binds the arrow input to
a pattern ('value' in this example).  Arrow statements in a '''do''' block take one of these forms:

* ''variable binding pattern'' &lt;- ''arrow'' -&lt; ''pure expression giving arrow input''
* ''arrow'' -&lt; ''pure expression giving arrow input''

Like with monads, the '''do''' keyword is needed only to combine multiple lines using the variable binding patterns
with &lt;code&gt;&lt;-&lt;/code&gt;.  As with monads, the last line isn't allowed to have a variable binding pattern, and the
output value of the last line is the output value of the arrow.  &lt;code&gt;returnA&lt;/code&gt; is an arrow just like
'total' is (in fact, &lt;code&gt;returnA&lt;/code&gt; is just the identity arrow, defined as &lt;code&gt;arr id&lt;/code&gt;).

Also like with monads, lines other than the last line may have no variable binding, and you get
the effect only, discarding the return value.  In 'Circuit', there would never be a point
in doing this (since no state can escape except through the return value), but in many arrows
there would be.

As you can see, for this example the 'proc' notation makes the code much more readable.  Let's try them:

&lt;pre&gt;
*Main&gt; runCircuit mean1 [0,10,7,8]
[0.0,5.0,5.666666666666667,6.25]
*Main&gt; runCircuit mean2 [0,10,7,8]
[0.0,5.0,5.666666666666667,6.25]
*Main&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Hangman: Pick a word ==

Now for our Hangman game.  Let's pick a word from a dictionary:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
generator :: Random a =&gt; (a, a) -&gt; StdGen -&gt; Circuit () a
generator range rng = accum rng $ \() rng -&gt; randomR range rng

dictionary = [&quot;dog&quot;, &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;bird&quot;]

pickWord :: StdGen -&gt; Circuit () String
pickWord rng = proc () -&gt; do
    idx &lt;- generator (0, length dictionary-1) rng -&lt; ()
    returnA -&lt; dictionary !! idx
&lt;/source&gt;

With 'generator', we're using the accumulator functionality to hold our random number generator.
&lt;code&gt;pickWord&lt;/code&gt; doesn't introduce anything new, except that the generator arrow is constructed by
a Haskell function that takes arguments.
Here is the output:

&lt;pre&gt;
*Main&gt; rng &lt;- getStdGen
*Main&gt; runCircuit (pickWord rng) [(), (), ()]
[&quot;dog&quot;,&quot;bird&quot;,&quot;dog&quot;]
*Main&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;

We will use this little arrow in a minute. It returns &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; the first time, then &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;
forever afterwards:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
oneShot :: Circuit () Bool
oneShot = accum True $ \_ acc -&gt; (acc, False)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
*Main&gt; runCircuit oneShot [(), (), (), (), ()]
[True,False,False,False,False]
&lt;/pre&gt;

The game's main arrow will be executed repeatedly, and we would like to pick the
word only once on the first iteration, and have it remember it for the rest of
the game.  Rather than just mask its output on subsequent loops, we'd prefer to
actually run &lt;code&gt;pickWord&lt;/code&gt; only once (since in a real implementation it could be very slow).
However, as it stands, the data flow in a Circuit '''must''' go down
'''all''' the paths of component arrows.  In order to allow the data flow to go down
one path and not another, we need to make our arrow an instance of &lt;code&gt;ArrowChoice&lt;/code&gt;.
Here's the minimal definition:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance ArrowChoice Circuit where
    left orig@(Circuit cir) = Circuit $ \ebd -&gt; case ebd of
        Left b -&gt; let (cir', c) = cir b
                  in  (left cir', Left c)
        Right d -&gt; (left orig, Right d)

getWord :: StdGen -&gt; Circuit () String
getWord rng = proc () -&gt; do
    -- If this is the first game loop, run pickWord. mPicked becomes Just &lt;word&gt;.
    -- On subsequent loops, mPicked is Nothing.
    firstTime &lt;- oneShot -&lt; ()
    mPicked &lt;- if firstTime
        then do
            picked &lt;- pickWord rng -&lt; ()
            returnA -&lt; Just picked
        else returnA -&lt; Nothing
    -- An accumulator that retains the last 'Just' value.
    mWord &lt;- accum' Nothing mplus -&lt; mPicked
    returnA -&lt; fromJust mWord
&lt;/source&gt;

Because &lt;code&gt;ArrowChoice&lt;/code&gt; is defined, the compiler now allows us to put an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; after &lt;-, and thus
choose which arrow to execute (either run &lt;code&gt;pickWord&lt;/code&gt;, or skip it).  Note that this is not a normal Haskell
&lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;:  The compiler implements this using &lt;code&gt;ArrowChoice&lt;/code&gt;.
The compiler also implements &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; here in the same way.

It is important to understand that none of the local name bindings, including the 'proc' argument, is
in scope between &lt;- and -&lt; except in the condition of an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt;.
For example, this is illegal:

&lt;pre&gt;
{-
proc rng -&gt; do
    idx &lt;- generator (0, length dictionary-1) rng -&lt; ()  -- ILLEGAL
    returnA -&lt; dictionary !! idx
-}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The arrow to execute, here &lt;code&gt;generator (0, length dictionary -1) rng&lt;/code&gt;, is evaluated
in the scope that exists outside the 'proc' statement.  &lt;code&gt;rng&lt;/code&gt; does not exist in this scope.
If you think about it, this makes sense, because the arrow is constructed at the beginning
only (outside 'proc').  If it were constructed for each execution of the arrow, how would it
keep its state?

Let's try &lt;code&gt;getWord&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;
*Main&gt; rng &lt;- getStdGen
*Main&gt; runCircuit (getWord rng) [(), (), (), (), (), ()]
[&quot;dog&quot;,&quot;dog&quot;,&quot;dog&quot;,&quot;dog&quot;,&quot;dog&quot;,&quot;dog&quot;]
*Main&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Hangman: Main program ==

Now here is the game:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
hangman :: StdGen -&gt; Circuit String [String]
hangman rng = proc userInput -&gt; do

== Advanced stuff ==

In this section I will complete the coverage of arrow notation.

=== Combining arrow commands with a function ===

We implemented mean2 like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
mean2 :: Fractional a =&gt; Circuit a a
mean2 = proc value -&gt; do
    t &lt;- total -&lt; value
    n &lt;- total -&lt; 1
    returnA -&lt; t / n
&lt;/source&gt;

GHC defines a banana bracket syntax for combining arrow statements with a function that operates
on arrows.  (In Ross Paterson's paper
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/notation.html Ross Paterson's Paper specifying arrow 'proc' notation]&lt;/ref&gt;
a '''form''' keyword is used, but GHC adopted the banana bracket
instead.)  Although there's no real reason to, we can write 'mean' like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
mean3 :: Fractional a =&gt; Circuit a a
mean3 = proc value -&gt; do
    (t, n) &lt;- (| (&amp;&amp;&amp;) (total -&lt; value) (total -&lt; 1) |)
    returnA -&lt; t / n
&lt;/source&gt;

The first item inside the &lt;code&gt;(| ... |)&lt;/code&gt; is a function that takes any number of arrows as input and
returns an arrow.  Infix notation cannot be used here.  It is followed by the arguments, which are in the
form of proc statements.  These statements may contain '''do''' and bindings with &lt;- if you like.  Each argument
is translated into an arrow and given as an argument to the function &lt;code&gt;(&amp;&amp;&amp;)&lt;/code&gt;.

You may ask, what is the point of this? We can combine arrows quite happily without the '''proc''' notation.
Well, the point is that you get the convenience of using local variable bindings in the statements.

The banana brackets are in fact not required.  The compiler is intelligent enough to assume that this is
what you mean when you write it like this (note that infix notation ''is'' allowed here):

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
mean4 :: Fractional a =&gt; Circuit a a
mean4 = proc value -&gt; do
    (t, n) &lt;- (total -&lt; value) &amp;&amp;&amp; (total -&lt; 1)
    returnA -&lt; t / n
&lt;/source&gt;

So why do we need the banana brackets?  For situations where this plainer syntax is
ambiguous.  The reason is that the arrow part of a 'proc' command is ''not an ordinary Haskell expression''.
Recall that for arrows specified in proc statements, the following things hold true:

* Local variable bindings are only allowed in the input expression after &lt;code&gt;-&lt;&lt;/code&gt;, and for the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; condition.  The arrow itself is interpreted in the scope that exists outside ''proc''.
* &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; statements are not plain Haskell. They are implemented using &lt;code&gt;ArrowChoice&lt;/code&gt;.
* Functions used to combine arrows are not normal Haskell either.  They are shorthand for banana bracket notation.

=== Recursive bindings ===

At the risk of wearing out the &lt;code&gt;mean&lt;/code&gt; example, here is yet another way to implement it using recursive
bindings.  In order for this to work, we'll need an arrow that delays its input by one step:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
delay :: a -&gt; Circuit a a
delay last = Circuit $ \this -&gt; (delay this, last)
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is what delay does:

&lt;pre&gt;
*Main&gt; runCircuit (delay 0) [5,6,7]
[0,5,6]
*Main&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here is our recursive version of &lt;code&gt;mean&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
mean5 :: Fractional a =&gt; Circuit a a 
mean5 = proc value -&gt; do
    rec
        (lastTot, lastN) &lt;- delay (0,0) -&lt; (tot, n)
        let (tot, n) = (lastTot + value, lastN + 1)
        let mean = tot / n
    returnA -&lt; mean
&lt;/source&gt;

The '''rec''' block resembles a '''do''' block, except that

* The last line can be, and usual is, a variable binding.  It doesn't matter whether it's a &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; or a '''do'''-block binding with &lt;code&gt;&lt;-&lt;/code&gt;.
* The '''rec''' block doesn't have a return value.  &lt;code&gt;var &lt;- rec ...&lt;/code&gt; is illegal, and '''rec''' is not allowed to be the last element in a '''do''' block.
* The use of variables is expected to form a cycle (otherwise there is no point in '''rec''').

The machinery of '''rec''' is handled by the &lt;/code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt; function of the &lt;code&gt;ArrowLoop&lt;/code&gt; class,
which we define for Circuit like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance ArrowLoop Circuit where
    loop (Circuit cir) = Circuit $ \b -&gt;
        let (cir', (c,d)) = cir (b,d)
        in  (loop cir', c)
&lt;/source&gt;

Behind the scenes, the way it works is this:

* Any variables defined in '''rec''' that are forward referenced in '''rec''' are looped around by passing them through the second tuple element of &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt;.  Effectively the variable bindings and references to them can be in any order (but the order of arrow statements is significant in terms of effects).
* Any variables defined in '''rec''' that are referenced from outside '''rec''' are returned in the first tuple element of &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt;.

It is important to understand that &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt; (and therefore '''rec''') simply binds variables. It doesn't hold onto values
and pass them back in the next invocation - 'delay' does this part. The cycle formed by the variable
references must be broken by some sort of delay arrow or lazy evaluation, otherwise
the code would die in an infinite loop as if you had written &lt;code&gt;let a = a+1&lt;/code&gt; in
plain Haskell.

=== ArrowApply ===

As mentioned before, the arrow part of an arrow statement (before &lt;code&gt;-&lt;&lt;/code&gt;) can't contain any variables
bound inside 'proc'.  There is an alternative operator, &lt;code&gt;-&lt;&lt;&lt;/code&gt; which removes this restriction.  It
requires the arrow to implement the &lt;code&gt;ArrowApply&lt;/code&gt; typeclass.

{{navigation|Book=Primary Mathematics
|current=Metric system
|previous=Percentages
|next=Time expressions}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;



The metric system, originating in France in 1791, is the current international standard for measurements.    In common use, there are three units that are frequently used in the metric system:
* Meter (m) - a unit of length
* Gram (g) - a unit of mass
* Second (s) - a unit of time.

The two tangible units, meter and gram, can be converted to larger and smaller representations simply by multiplying by 10.

== Meter ==
A meter is the standard unit of length; it is approximately equal to 39.37 inches (3.28 feet) in the US customary system.

A normal meter stick will have 10 divisions, each representing 1 decimeter (dm).  This is further divided by 10 to give a total of 100 centimeters (cm), and then by ten again to give 1000 millimeters (mm). 

1000 meters equals 1 kilometer (km).

In the UK a meter is known as a &quot;metre&quot;.

== Gram ==

The gram is a unit of mass.  It is commonly used to state weights as well.

There are 1000 grams in a kilogram (kg).

1000 kilograms is equal to 1 tonne (t).

A milligram (mg) is 1/1000&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of a gram.  Milligrams are often used in medicine and chemistry.

== Liter ==

The liter (L) is a unit of liquid volume, equal to a cube of water measuring 10cm * 10cm * 10cm.  A milliliter (mL) is equal to one cubic centimeter.

the ssh class this tutorial uses is subpar. i've never seen a shared host that had it and it's fairly difficult to get working even if you do control your own machine. phpseclib is a much better to utilize ssh in your php apps:

      <comment>introduce a section about dif/2 before diving into CLPFD</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">We've seen that in Prolog, a variable can be either bound (have a value, possibly another variable) or free (have no value). '''Constraint logic programming''' (CLP) extends the notion of a logical variable by allowing variables to have a ''domain'' rather than a specific value. Variables can also be ''constrained'', which means that their value must abide by certain rules specified by the programmer. Constraint logic programming makes it possible to solve complex combinatorial problems with a minimum amount of code.

==Introduction: the dif/2 constraint==
Often, Prolog programming revolves around constraints on the values of variables, embodied in the notion of unification. For example, the goal &lt;code&gt;X = f(1)&lt;/code&gt; can be said to constrain the variable &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; to take on the value &lt;code&gt;f(1)&lt;/code&gt;. Unification is of course more general than this, since &lt;code&gt;X = Y&lt;/code&gt; constrains two variables to take on the same value, while &lt;code&gt;X = f(_)&lt;/code&gt; constrains &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; in yet a third way: it may take on any of an infinite set of values that includes &lt;code&gt;f([])&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;f(hamburger)&lt;/code&gt;, but the value it takes on must match the &quot;template&quot; &lt;code&gt;f(_)&lt;/code&gt;.

Standard unification is limited, though, in that it can only put a &quot;positive&quot; constraint on a variable. If we want to state that &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; may be bound to any value ''other than'' those matching &lt;code&gt;f(_)&lt;/code&gt;, then we can use unification together with negation, but we have to be very careful. As we've seen in an [[../Cuts and Negation|earlier chapter]], we can sometimes use negation as failure to express inequality, but this is not always reliable:

&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
?- X = 1, \+ X == 1.
false.

?- \+ X == 1, X = 1.
true
&lt;/source&gt;

This ''non-monotonic'' property of &lt;code&gt;\+&lt;/code&gt; forces us to reorder goals to get variables bound at just the right time, making code harder to read, write and understand.

:''Exercise''. Write a predicate that succeeds when its input is a list containing only unique values. E.g. &lt;code&gt;unique([1,2])&lt;/code&gt; should succeed, but &lt;code&gt;unique([foo,foo,1])&lt;/code&gt; should fail because &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; appears twice. How does your predicate deal with &lt;code&gt;unique([X,X])&lt;/code&gt;? How about &lt;code&gt;unique([A,B,C,D])&lt;/code&gt;?

Enter the &lt;code&gt;dif&lt;/code&gt; predicate. This predicate, available in SWI and SICStus (but not strictly standard Prolog) allows us to constrain two variables to be different. The following SWI-Prolog session shows its operation:

&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
?- dif(X,Y).
dif(X,Y).

?- dif(X, Y), member(X, [foo, bar]), member(Y, [foo, bar]).
X = foo,
Y = bar ;
X = bar,
Y = foo ;
false.
&lt;/source&gt;

Contrast this with the result of the other inequality predicates &lt;code&gt;\=&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\==&lt;/code&gt;.

:''Exercise''. Implement the &lt;code&gt;unique/1&lt;/code&gt; predicate again, but this time use &lt;code&gt;dif/2&lt;/code&gt;. What is Prolog's response to the query &lt;code&gt;unique([A,B,C,D,E])&lt;/code&gt;? How many constraints does it report?

:''Exercise''. Write a predicate &lt;code&gt;not_f1/1&lt;/code&gt; that constrains its argument to not be of the form &lt;code&gt;f(_)&lt;/code&gt;, i.e. not a one-argument term with functor &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; ''Hint'': use the &lt;code&gt;=..&lt;/code&gt; (&quot;univ&quot;) operator.

==Finite-domain constraints==
We now turn to a much more powerful constraint handling system: constraint logic programming on finite domains, also known as CLP(fd). To use this, we must load a library. In SWI-Prolog, that's:

&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
?- use_module(library(clpfd)).
&lt;/source&gt;

Do you remember how arithmetic in Prolog fails when used with insufficiently instantiated variables? Try this for a starter:

&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
?- X &gt; Y, member(X,[1,2,3]), Y=2.
&lt;/source&gt;

Even though there is logically one possible answer to this query (&lt;tt&gt;X=3&lt;/tt&gt;), Prolog cannot infer it. We can get the right answer by rearranging the conjuncts of the query:

&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
?- member(X,[1,2,3]), Y=2, X &gt; Y.
&lt;/source&gt;

CLP(fd) is a lot smarter than Prolog when it comes to arithmetic. Try this (note: ECLiPSe users should replace &lt;tt&gt;in&lt;/tt&gt; by &lt;tt&gt;::&lt;/tt&gt;):

&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
?- X #&gt; Y, X in 1..3, Y=2.
&lt;/source&gt;

This succeeds with the only correct answer, &lt;tt&gt;X=3&lt;/tt&gt;. The predicate &lt;tt&gt;#&gt;/2&lt;/tt&gt;, when given two variables, ''posts the constraint'' that it left argument should be greater than its right argument. CLP(fd) holds this constraint in its ''constraint store'' until it knows enough about the variables' possible values to infer further information from it. The moment that &lt;tt&gt;Y&lt;/tt&gt; gets the value 2, CLP(fd) infers that &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt; can only have the value 3.

What happens when we bind &lt;tt&gt;Y&lt;/tt&gt; to 1 instead?

&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
?- X #&gt; Y, X in 1..3, Y=1.
Y = 1,
X in 2..3.
&lt;/source&gt;

Rather than start backtracking over the possible values of &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt;, CLP(fd) constrains &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt; to a smaller domain and stops. To have CLP(fd) search for possible assignments to variables, we must tell it do so explicitly. The simplest way to do that is with the predicate &lt;tt&gt;label/1&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
?- X #&gt; Y, X in 1..3, Y=1, label([X]).
X = 2,
Y = 1 ;
X = 3,
Y = 1.
&lt;/source&gt;

What we've seen so far isn't very interesting, because there was only one constraint variable. Let's have a look at a problem with eight variables.

==Send more money==
The ''[[:w:Verbal arithmetic|send more money]]'' puzzle is the quintessential example of a constraint problem. It amount to assigning ''different'' digits 0 through 9 to the variables &lt;tt&gt;[S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y]&lt;/tt&gt; such that the sum

    SEND
 + &lt;u&gt; MORE&lt;/u&gt;
 = MONEY

is solved; &lt;tt&gt;S&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;M&lt;/tt&gt; should both be greater than zero. Instead of typing to the Prolog prompt, let's make a proper Prolog module.

&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
:- use_module(library(clpfd)).

sendmoremoney(Vars) :-
    Vars = [S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y],
    Vars ins 0..9,
    S #\= 0,
    M #\= 0,
    all_different(Vars),
                 1000*S + 100*E + 10*N + D
    +            1000*M + 100*O + 10*R + E
    #= 10000*M + 1000*O + 100*N + 10*E + Y.
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;ins/2&lt;/tt&gt; is the same as &lt;tt&gt;in/2&lt;/tt&gt;, except that it sets the domains of several variables at the same time. (ECLiPSe: use &lt;tt&gt;::&lt;/tt&gt;, SICStus: use &lt;tt&gt;domain(Vars,0,9)&lt;/tt&gt;). &lt;tt&gt;all_different&lt;/tt&gt; (which may be called &lt;tt&gt;all_distinct&lt;/tt&gt; in some implementations) is logically equivalent to posting disequality constraints (&lt;tt&gt;#\=&lt;/tt&gt;) on all pairs of variables in &lt;tt&gt;Vars&lt;/tt&gt;, but is shorter and possibly more efficient. Note that we can express the sum as one constraint over all eight variables at the same time. Let's try this out:

&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
?- sendmoremoney([S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y]).
S = 9,
M = 1,
O = 0,
E in 4..7,
all_different([E, N, D, R, Y, 0, 1, 9]),
1000*9+91*E+ -90*N+D+ -9000*1+ -900*0+10*R+ -1*Y#=0,
N in 5..8,
D in 2..8,
R in 2..8,
Y in 2..8.
&lt;/source&gt;

Even without labeling variables, CLP(fd) has inferred the values of three variables, has simplified the sum and put tighter bounds on the remaining five variables. Ofcourse, we want values for all our variables:

&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
?- Vars=[S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y], sendmoremoney(Vars), label(Vars).
Vars = [9, 5, 6, 7, 1, 0, 8, 2],
S = 9,
E = 5,
N = 6,
D = 7,
M = 1,
O = 0,
R = 8,
Y = 2
&lt;/source&gt;

This should run instantly. ''Exercise'': implement the puzzle in Prolog without CLP(fd), and notice how long it takes to run.

== New user warning template ==

I just created a new template that I've found myself wanting: [[:Template:Use talk page]].  This template can be used to suggest that a user ask questions and make comments about a module in the module's talk page instead of in its main page.  I dunno about you, but I see a lot of that.  Feel free to reword the message.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 15:50, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

== Request for semi-protection ==

I am wondering if someone could semi-protect [[Template:Subject Search]]. I have included it on the [[Wikipedia:Library]] page. Thanks. [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 20:47, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

== [[C++ Programming]] ==

The [[C++ Programming]] page has apparently been fully protected for at least a year now, apparently due to some sort of edit war... I don't really know, or care, about the reasons that it was originally protected, but I imagine that the original conflict has been either resolved or forgotten by now. Isn't it time to remove protection from the page?[[User:Ohms law|Ohms law]] ([[User talk:Ohms law|talk]]) 21:18, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

:There are three different tables of contents for the book. It's something, isn't it? Unprotecting would be the easy part. Choosing a table of contents, apparently, was and is the hard part. From the number of C++ books, people just took their balls and went home, so to speak, instead of contributing to the C++ Programming book.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:47, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

::Sorry but you are new to the problem.  The existence of multiple tocs aren't an issue. For correctness lets clearly state that there was no edit war, the issue was already readdressed many times but I'm always willing to explain one more time...
::The edit conflict that generated the &quot;issue&quot; was a result of (an admin) unilaterally and against stated opposition, proceeded to unprotect the original toc moving it into toc1 and replacing the frontpage with what is presently there. This actions have been requested to be reverted at the time and several times since then...
::As a last attempt to resolve the issue and because several Wikibookias requested action. I, using the normal process of discussion (clearly publicized to the interested book community and previous active actors on the dispute) obtained a status of nonblocking to the requested reversal (still pending as valid) that all previous admins refused to act upon (as they are allowed to do). More information for both of you is available on the talk page of the project there is a log of the book history and previous discussions on the subject can be examined on VFD and the Administrative Assistance archive...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:34, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

: A show of consensus is needed to resolve the problem with the book's main page. Unfortunately I think its likely the page will remain forever protected because some people just aren't able to move on and won't accept putting it to a vote to decide its future. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:50, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

I went to add some categorization tags to this page and I noticed that it has been protected, and apparently has been protected for a few years to settle a dispute.  Is there any chance of unprotecting the page? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 13:59, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

:When pigs fly, when Hell freezes over, etc from responses I've seen previously on this.  The book is dead with it like this.  The original contributors are still around and grudges persist. Frankly, I don't care what the reasoning was. I was not a party to it and as an outsider to the book I have to say this is utterly pathetic.  This is the equivalent of a parent taking a toy away from two children because they can't share and this should never happen on a ''collaborative'' wiki.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:31, 4 August 2009 (UTC)

::I cringe to still participate on this type of discussions since I have done all that is possible to solve the issue. The book is not &quot;dead&quot; it is mangled, evolution has slowed down and the impetus of contributions have been hugely affected by keeping things as they are.
::A request for the reposition of the [[C++ Programming/TOC1]] into the [[C++ Programming]] location in accord with the adopted book convention that defines that the [[C++ Programming/Conventions|&quot;Cover page will display the historical book index...&quot;]] the [[Talk:C++ Programming/Conventions|discussion of the subject]] was opened in 13 March 2008, closed 19 July 2008. This is still pending for administrative action [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/Administrative_Assistance&amp;oldid=1249561#Request_for_administrative_action Previous discussion here]...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:43, 4 August 2009 (UTC)

:::TOC1 links to more pages of the book, but I like TOC2's simplicity without all the transclusions.  Why doesn't the book have a table of contents listing chapters and the chapters themselves listing their contents given the structure?  You've got pages with several chapters in their path but the chapters themselves don't link to their subpages.  TOC1 links deep in the hierarchy for several pages while TOC2 links only to the first level.  Add to that the several page moves that have been made such that many of the TOC2 links redirect.  Looking through the prefix index for the book, a lot of the pages still point to redirects and haven't been updated.  The print versions of TOC1 don't match naming convention for chapter print versions.  Many pages are transcluding subpages rather than linking to them, making editing and reading more difficult.  

:::Both TOCs and the book structure are a mess.  TOC1 is too complicated and TOC2 is out of date and won't work unless subpages are linked from chapters.  All the TOCs need to go and a simpler and up to date one created, and the book structure made simpler for people to edit. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:49, 4 August 2009 (UTC)

::::Regarding the TOC1 (the original toc), the situation is the result of the evolution of the book not a construct made to aggravate editors (and doesn't seem to bother readers by page access it always have been the preferred entry point) even now were its usefulness to navigation has been hampered because the root page is now the locked cover menu.

::::''Why doesn't the book have a table of contents listing chapters and the chapters themselves listing their contents given the structure?''
::::The TOC1 structure has all the chapters listed (but preserves a chapter structure for easy navigation to subpages, this is needed due to the non linear interconnects of the C++ language) and that substructure is presented at the end of each chapters again (ie: [[C++ Programming/Chapter Getting Started]] at the bottom). I take you are objecting to the above average subtext near each chapter (if we compare it for instance with the [[Mac OS X]] book that has a single line). I have responded to similar requests to reduce them  (due to aesthetics) but the information there is relevant and pertinent.

::::''You've got pages with several chapters in their path but the chapters themselves don't link to their subpages.''
::::The chapters page are not content, they are layout helpers and navigational structures. They aren't supposed to link to any content, they were created to fragment the single page version that existed before, as an editor I find it very helpful to do quick restructuring (this was a major necessity and evolved from the concepts of the creator of TOC2 in a consensual discussion withing the book community, this action also removed an obsolete alternative navigation sheme).

::::''TOC1 links deep in the hierarchy for several pages while TOC2 links only to the first level.''
::::TOC1 only links to the first level, trasclusions do link to subsections were relevant. TOC2 was created as an alternative toc with consensus but evolved into a different and incompatible structure (the order of the content, heading levels etc... were contradictory) and this alternative TOC was mostly maintained by one editor that had a focus only on reformatting the content (this also resulted in duplication of content to new pages, loss of edit histories and moving pages out or simple deletion of content, this is still a problem that needs to be resolved since readers still miss that deleted information by making request for the inclusion of those basic concepts what is a program etc). I have never maintained nor supported toc2 from its conception and this was stated when I didn't object to its creation, so the page today has no real purpose but a separate VFD process on that did raise an objection to its deletion (even if badly substantiated), the page has stalled (been dead) after the creation of the new cover page. Today I'm not pursuing the wish to see it deleted. So soon or later if no one takes on the job I will give it some usefulness as there is a need for a detailed sub toc for another part of that project.
::::TOC1 can be complicated for the average Wikibookian but it is open to evolution the primarily points I defend is that a single page version can be available to editors since this helps maintain consistency on this project (it is the 3 or 4th largest book on Wikibooks in number of pages), having the possibility to pint each chapter independently is also a boon as well have all changes centralized and automatically reflected on the structure and content. This is a community if someone lacks the technical skills to do something they need only ask and at this level of complexity (book structure not the TOC layout) changes to it must be done with care...

::::I hope I have addressed your points. The TOC is always open to changes and new proposals (the actual structure today is not even to my particular like, most chapters are named accordingly to the proposals and objections from the creator of TOC2, some have already received some negative comments, IIRC they are still on the book structure discussion page).
::::You also have to take in account that this book was renamed 3 times at least and is also the result of a forced merge (see the proposal of the fork policy if you care), so the level of detail on its structure is well worked out due to these consecutive changes that needed to be made.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:45, 5 August 2009 (UTC)

I am amazed the table of contents of this book evokes such deep feelings.  I am intentionally leaving my opinion of the TOC's out of this conversation, because it clouds the matter.  At least three editors are seeking this page to be unprotected.  Myself, Panic and Ohms Law. I am a bit disturbed by comments like &quot;I think its likely the page will remain forever protected ...&quot;, that is just not an acceptable outcome on a wiki.  No one will ever be able to be bold and introduce some radical, sexy, ultimately pleasing TOC3 which solves the problem if they can't edit the page.  (I agree the probability of that happening may be approximately 1/&quot;number of particles in the universe&quot;.)  Even worse I cannot put a {{tlx|merge}}, {{tlx|DDC}}, {{tlx|VfD}}, etc on the page because no one is allowed to edit it.  Let's unprotect the page. If some edit war ensues, then we may protect it again.  

Leaving it protected gets in the way more then an ugly TOC would. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 09:05, 5 August 2009 (UTC)

:I will unprotect it.  Let's hope feelings have cooled down since March 2007 such that rational discussion can accompany any conflicting ideas regarding the book's direction.  I favor moving TOC1 to the root, as it is more complete and better maintained.  The Editor's TOC is more for maintenance.  That assessment is made without regard to the parties involved or the comments they've made or the proposals they've put forward.  I do feel that TOC1 could be improved upon, however, as described above.  I may bite the bullet and move TOC1 outright so that improvements can begin. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:01, 5 August 2009 (UTC)

:: I only think that being left protected forever was/is likely because its unlikely consensus will be established, which is the issue that has never been resolved. Even now instead of trying to establish consensus a person has tried to game the system, continues to make untrue claims, and directing people to complain about the protection rather then discuss and establish consensus. If the page is unprotected I don't think any page should be moved in its place. I think third parties not involved in the original dispute should be responsible for coming up with a new TOC. I think the admin who unprotects the page needs to keep a close eye on the book and see what happens. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:42, 5 August 2009 (UTC)

:: I think checking for sockpuppets might also make sense in order to ensure someone isn't trying to game the system now.

::: I take offense on having again, of all people state that I have the intention to deceive (without pointing out were I lied) and that I'm the instigator of this last action (I had conformed that no administrator had the guts to put things right, even if this action is not really addressing what you have done, for the ones unaware, Darklama is the creator of TOC2 and the initiator of this particular situation). 
::: You should think twice when requesting or mentioning consensus as a requirement to take further action on this subject, since you have used your administrative tools to further you own objectives against previously stated objection (with valid arguments that are undeniable today) to make TOC2 the cover page (probably yet another attempt to aggravate me, while I was wrongly blocked), this action is expressly prohibited by policy at the time and goes way beyond what we today acept as a BeBold action. You have unprotect the coverpage, moved those pages and altered edit histories. Yet no one took action to correct this event.
::: I have admitted to my errors (none justified the actions taken against me). I have addressed all my mistakes (James and even the Swift incident). 
::: As for my civil disobedience actions, and the use of sockpuppets. I don't regret any nor have they caused arm, not even to the well being of the project, in several aspect I think things have improved due to my actions along the time I've been participating here.
::: For [[User:Adrignola]] benefit I must clarify that [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/BixoDePalha User:BixoDePalha] was one of my sock puppets and that SBJohnny was aware of it (and others I used at that time), in that case it was not against policy to do what I did, nor was SBJohnny intervention helpful, due the brouhaha that was occurring at the time his action caused more harm than good.
::: Ultimately I've nothing to regret except to the already admitted mistakes and I would probably act in a similar way since I mostly attempt to defend what I see are valid points.
::: I'm not and never was out to get you. I've even came to bypass my regret of having changed my vote to support your adminship, since ultimately the good out weighs the bad. I can live with our divergences in several issues and recognize you as valid member of the community even as an administrator and it saddens me that you are still take every chance to attack my character even hampering my participation on the project... 
::: For one that voted for the deletion of that book and stated that wished no more involvement, the time you dedicate preventing others to fix this issue is truly baffling.
::: I've been always as direct as I can, but always avoided dragging your name out when referring to those actions, I have even attempted to provide a way for you to save face. So please take this chance to clarify any of your initial actions that lead us into this path and state where I'm intentionally distorting facts or gaming the system, if not please do stop with those types of public insinuations, they aren't helping and will always goat me into having to reply to prevent insinuations to become facts.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:34, 6 August 2009 (UTC)

:::: I don't presume to know what your intentions are. I think a checkuser is needed because of your past willingness to use sockpuppets for &quot;civil disobedience&quot; as you call it, to ensure you are not doing so again. I consider your past &quot;civil disobedience&quot; to be one way you have attempted to deceive the community.
:::: Sure I created TOC2, but TOC2 is not why the book's main page was protected. The book's main page was protected because you and I failed to find a way to work cooperatively together and settle any differences on our own. An admin felt that what both of us did as a result of not finding a way to work problems out on our own was unacceptable and so blocked the main page in order to prevent further problems until consensus could be reached. I accept that consensus is needed and have participated in past efforts to reach consensus on the matter. I think you did not like the way consensus was going. I think because you did not like the way consensus was going you have attempted to distract the matter by focusing on issues not relevant to why the page was protected. You were blocked indefinitely for the events you described and it has nothing to do with why the book's main page was protected. I believe it is reasonable to assume that things will continue to involve and move forward when a person is not expected to be able to return.
:::: The book's main page was unprotected after months of effort shifting through old discussions related to the book's merger to try to find a reason why it was protected originally and not finding a reason. That unprotection had nothing to do with you or what happened to cause its protection again.
:::: I have no idea what edit histories you think I altered and that too has nothing to do with why it was protected again. If you wish to address the matter of altered edit histories, I suggest you start a new discussion and point out what you think was altered. Depending on what you consider &quot;an alteration&quot; I may even attempt to fix it myself.
:::: Why it was protected isn't even important any more to resolving the matter and can be considered a distraction. I think distractions are another way you attempt to deceive people. What matters is moving forward by ensuring any further disagreements about the book's main page is resolved through consensus so that it doesn't need to be protected again.
:::: I don't feel I have done anything that would require &quot;saving face&quot;, nor do I see any need to refer to actions that had nothing to do with why the book's main page was protected. Again for the sake of not having to reread what I wrote, the protection is because you and I did not find an appropriate way to settle are disagreements on our own. What I proposed above basically amounts to is that someone other than you and I should make changes to the book's main page and make any decisions regarding the main page. I can even accept being checkusered myself if it would help ease anyone's doubts. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:34, 6 August 2009 (UTC)

If you can act like rational humans for a minute, I think I have a compromise. It appears that one TOC is for a beginner's book and the other is for a user's guide. I advise making a two or three volume set. C++ Primer, C++ Programming, and the C++ Workbook. [[User:Geoff Plourde|Geoff Plourde]] ([[User talk:Geoff Plourde|talk]]) 02:50, 6 August 2009 (UTC)

::No you got it wrong. This is not about the selecting the TOCs content or structure, nor is it about creating a new TOC (even if that would admittedly remove the problem, but with a cost to the project). This time it all began because of request for the removal of the protection on the cover page by a third party nothing more (This action was now done). Of note is that the protection itself was irregular and highly partial... 
::If you don't care about understanding the issue, then at least refrain to call it infantile, this is a festering issue that has been plaguing the project for several years now. If it had a simple solution it would already be done.
::To the parties involved it has significance and has several implications on the project, these can be resume to:
::#Should we permit admins to abuse their tools as they see fit? (the actual policy says no, so why do admins close their eyes in this particular instance?)
::#Reversal of edits due to conflict. (Conflict of edits, there is no clear policy/guideline to resolve them. The practice so far that seems to have more traction, especially after the adoption of the BeBold policy, is that any unilateral edit that is done if contested can be a target for reversal, if that reversion is justified).
::#What constitutes a consensual decission? (there is no consensus on that one, and the process definition is lax on the now created requirement for a statement of non objection. This is the corner stone of our decission making process)
:::All Wikibookians have the commitment (required by policy) to defend our policies/guidelines. I can't validate item 1 and since the other party doesn't accept any blame on the issue we had a stalemate validated by the rest of administrative community, the same ones that are bound by that rule. This has gone to the extremes that all refused to take action on the issue (a copout). This is an issue that therefore has relevancy.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:06, 6 August 2009 (UTC)

;;;;; &lt;small&gt;Reply to the above post of Darklama on 17:34, 6 August 2009 (UTC):&lt;/small&gt;
::::: Please clarify my attempt to deceive the community. I informed that I would do it previously and no deception was used. I continued to participate in policy discussions and to attempt to clarify any prejudgments and fight the same type o tripe you are spooning out again, my actions ultimately led to the correction of situation. I engaged in action again a minority group inside the administrative community. The events have shown that the &quot;participating&quot; community had no problem with my actions.
::::: The TOC2 was done cooperatively (this is on the logs), the only problems I had with it (some I still have) was when you intended to move it to the cover page the objections where simple (all were mentioned out before):
:::::#You were a reformatter in an very active book. (I classify a reformatter as someone new to a book community that intends to reformat extensively the existing content of a book without really participating with his own content. The problem behind this is similar to giving the administrative flag to any new Wikibookians). 
:::::#You had split the TOC elaboration across two distinct files with what seemed two distinct structures this was having huge impact on the heading level and even on the flow of the text. You were doing a vivisection on the book that from your words would turn it in something else.
:::::#I already had conflicts with your actions (not one reversal so far), you moved sections of the book out without even proposing those changes first (this was the bit about the MFC).
:::::#You were deleting useful content (you removed and resumed extensively the more basic introductions, even committing errors due to lack of knowledge).
:::::#Every other editor had been working with the original TOC (I had agreed but refused to maintain TOC2), any other edits by other Wikibookians of TOC2 started after the brouhaha.
:::::#Heck you weren't even willing to honor the authors section and the copy of the GFDL on the print version of TOC2, we had to have a big fight to have you comply.
:::::#I also initially voted against you having the administrative flags (on these same reasons). 
:::::Don't you think now that I think you have matured a bit, those were reasons sufficient to block your move. In fact after you quited working on TOC2 no one picked the slack (but check the original TOC), don't the fact prove you could have acted differently. You even got to start a new book one that could implement your vision and structure, I have been supporting from the sidelines (I created the C++ now subject page, have been sending your way content that is not usable on the C++ Programming book) but as I was afraid your intention was not to generate content and proving me wrong, but in the process you prevented other of doing so and have caused a lot of distress.
:::::The book main pages was protected against moves by the administrator that forced the merge. The simple action of you removing that protection to advance your own goals was ultimately against policy.
:::::As for other errors you did on the book I have to check out my notes I think I placed some of the information on the Robert Horning talk page, I member him validating that something as wrong, you can probably get the date of that action since it was when you moved the edit histories around the cover page and the old toc (we now have the old talk page on the cover page). I'll attempt to dig it up if you think it is important.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:30, 6 August 2009 (UTC)
:::::PS: I also understand (this is shared knowledge) that the problem of reformatters is a huge crux on the developing of Wikibooks (books are higly self contained entities). I don't want exclusive editorial control of my work, or anyone else's (I have been shouting this since the start, I never engaged in any similar problem with anyone else, not even Paddu) but since I have been on both sides of the problem (hence the issues with Paddu/fork) I fully understand that we have to somehow address this problem (the new flags seem to give some help but they still work across projects, yet you were an admin when you engaged in those actions. &lt;s&gt;I still think that the possibility of having an more experience editor attempt a reformatting action is low especially in an active book, but I could be wrong and we only don't have more issue due to the dwindling number of committed editors&lt;/s&gt;).
:::::Book communities must be fortified against similar havoc this is generally understood. The empowerment of book-communities has been mentioned by myself since the start of this mess, not every one has the stomach to even attempt to come to an understanding when these things occur. I from the start had no intention on getting involved in policy matters and endless debates (I said so when Paddu was blocking my own changes) but have regrettably have been forced to as to survive in this involvement, how much content could I have been adding to the project if this types of attritions wouldn't happen...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:30, 6 August 2009 (UTC) (updated)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:42, 6 August 2009 (UTC)

:::::: We're just repeating previous discussions now. Your bad assumptions about me from the moment of my first edit to Wikibooks is why so much time was spent doing other things rather than writing. You were told to [[WB:FAITH|assume good faith]] repeatedly and to [[WB:BITE|not bite newcomers]] when I first tried to contribute and you did not listen. Do you think I wanted to spent all my time urging and not getting things done? I never wanted any of it either. In the time that I was contributing to the book I saw you do the same thing to other potential contributors. Until you learn to stop making assumptions about other people your likely to continue to waste a lot of time, and likely to continue to attract the attention of admins. You don't know what my intentions were/are or weren't/aren't nor what I know or don't know because you made assumptions about me. I was not a reformater, reformating was not my objective. I had no hidden agenda or objectives in unprotecting the book's main page. I considered it a last step in cleaning up after the admin who had left many pages and redirects under Programming:C++, Programming:Cplus_plus, Programming:C_plus_plus, etc. It only took me a lot longer to get to it because I was backtracking through several years of history trying to find a rationalization for so I could see if the reason for its protection still applied, and so I could bring it up for discussion if needed, but I did not find anything to suggest it had been done beyond the admin making a judgment call. Like that admin I merely made a judgment call based on the fact the work left unfinished by the admin had been taken care of. The solution to the problem you seem to think exist is simple [[WB:BITE|Don't Bite Newcomers]] and [[WB:FAITH|Assume Good Faith]]. I don't particularly think people trying to improve books even if its just formating related is a problem. Books are suppose to be consist in style, but often over time become inconsistent and people interested in improving the formating so its consist shouldn't be frowned on out of hand. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:52, 7 August 2009 (UTC)

::::::: I've never attacked your character only your actions. I have never bitten you, I've blocked and contested some of your actions (most are listed above), until you started being unreachable by arguments and imposing your agenda. That lead to the request for arbitration. I haven't been uncivil, nor have you (even if we have been arguing on several issues) nor did I byte you in any way. No one but myself has had his actions more scrutinized on this project. Sadly this also demonstrates a duality on how Wikibookians are treated...
::::::: ''When I first tried to contribute and you did not listen.'' do you what me to prove that this is incorrect?
::::::: I will hunt down our first conversation. I assure you to the with a high degree of certainty that I welcomed you to the book, all problems started just after your had the epiphany to build TOC2 (sadly I didn't even object to that, IIRC I think even supported it).
::::::: You were indeed a reformatter due to the actions you took (I've called you out on it several times even pointing out the issues you were creating, I never reverted you, and on the meanwhile you were even duplicated content on the book namespace so to reduce and reformat the existing content).
::::::: Ultimately you never admired to any wrong doings. Do you even see any problem in having lifted the protection of the cover page and moving the TOC2 into it, against my stated objection (nor merely another editor but the person that has been contributing the most to that same book) as an action in conformity with our policies or even as being morally correct? This is my core grievance, and you seem to know perfectly well it is (by our first words about it above) but still fail to correct it (I don't even what you to admit anything) but you will not even let others do it for you, truly fantastic.
::::::: Be the bigger man and do it or at least don't fall back to lame excuses to validate or hinder the fixing process...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:29, 7 August 2009 (UTC)

:::::::PS: I've been walking weird for some time now, just waiting for the proper place to pull out that outrageous concept of requirement of a statement of non objection (that one is truthfully a logical bombshell, that spanner can block any non formalized decission process, even if it never applied to that particular attempt to resolve the issue).

There's a standard joke about different languages causing people to behave differently, with the punchline that speaking German makes you want to invade Poland.  I'd really like to know what it is about C++ that causes people to behave this way, so I can make sure to ''never design a programming language that way''.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 02:55, 7 August 2009 (UTC)

I was just browsing under the Science&gt;biology category and noticed that there was no ecology category.

How do I get it to show up in the browsing categories?

: The ecology book is currently under Science → Physical sciences → Environmental sciences → [[:Category:Ecology|Ecology]]. Both the [[Ecology/Introduction|introductory chapter]] of the book and the wikipedia article on [[w:ecology]] refer to ecology as the study of organisms as they interact in there environment. Where/how does ecology fit into biology? Is it wrong to consider ecology an environmental science? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:17, 25 August 2009 (UTC)

::&quot;Biology is the science of studying living organisms&quot; [[w:Biology]]. Does that answer your first question?  &quot;Environmental science is a field encompassing the wide range of scientific disciplines that need to be brought together to understand earth systems and the many interactions among physical, chemical, biological, and human components&quot; [[w:Environmental_science]]. Thus, most of these scientific disciplines (e.g. ecology) should not be classified as environmental sciences. Instead, only interdisciplinary approaches classify as environmental scienes. Thus, I would say, ecology is used by environmental science but it is itself not an environmental science.  --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 12:57, 26 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This guide will show you how to participate in the exploration of the Solar System. As Mars is the nearest Earth-like planet in many ways, we will start there. Mars is also a planet that has many probes around it and research going on into it, so you won't be short of materials.

== The Planetary Data System ==

The Planetary Data System: http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/

Imaging Node: http://img.pds.nasa.gov/

The PDS is a system for storing all the images and data that come from space missions. It is organised into nodes and we are interested in the imaging node. By far the easiest way of using the system is by using the Planetary Image Atlas. There are other interfaces in the PDS and the websites of various missions. Mission teams may also release their own images separately but the data they are based upon always ends up in the PDS although this may sometimes take a few months. Check mission websites for the latest images.

Planetary Image Atlas: http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/search/search.html

== Raw Data ==

A lot if images posted on space websites are in JPEG format which is an easy format for sharing images in. However, for investigative purposes it is not very good because the format uses what is known as &quot;lossy&quot; compression. Some of the original image is discarded in order to keep the size of the image file to a manageable size and the JPEG image may contain blocky and blurred sections as well as colour inaccuracies. Look for images in PNG or TIF format which are &quot;non lossy&quot;. That way you will be able to see the image exactly as the probe took it. Some images may be in Planetary Data System formats like IMG. There are command line utilities to read them like ISIS which you may need for larger images but most of the time it's easier to use the graphics package GIMP and a plugin made specially to read these types of images.

See the GIMP plugin repository: http://registry.gimp.org/node/1627

Follow the instructions to install the plugin for your operating system and GIMP version: http://areo.info/gimp/

Note. The 2.4 version has been tested with version 2.6 of GIMP and works with it.

== Basic Image Processing ==

Once you have the IMG file loaded, or other non-lossy format, unless the image has already been processed you may need to use Colours --&gt; Levels to balance the blacks and whites in the image to the point where features are visible to the eye. Notice the peaks and troughs in the GIMP levels dialogue. They correspond to details in the image and they will mark the boundary that you can drag the left and right arrow markers to. Don't drag over any parts of the graph if you can help it. As well as the left black and white marker on the right, the central arrow marker can also be dragged to change the balance of the image. Using the levels dialogue to properly process an image comes with experience. There is no single setting that will work with every image as every image is slightly different.

== De-striping ==

Some images need processing to remove vertical lines of noise.

=== Removing transmission errors ===

Some image have transmission errors in them that can mess up the de-striping process. There is a method to remove these before de-striping.

If that is the case, I am unable to reconcile her lack of such understanding with the fact that she is well attuned to the inner workings of Wikipedia, having gone through checkuser processes, three RfCs, an ArbCom case, more than 50,000 edits, countless GA reviews and a record of participation at FAC. In my own experience, I was simply not able to address her criticisms of the MBI article at GAR because they did not adhere to GA criteria: she was arguing for deletion, neglecting any understanding of core Wikipedia policies of Notability, Verifiability, and Reliable sources. I was simply dumbstruck that someone with such a long history of GA review could make such fundamental errors in discerning between GA and AfD criteria.]

*[https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SandyGeorgia&amp;diff=310948756&amp;oldid=310946324 Yes, something about psych articles causes Mattisse to show misapplications of Wikipedia policies, as if she's owning the entire suite of articles. It's not entirely limited to psych. She fairly insisted a term not be linked in ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' because the linked article was poorly written and cited. That is pretty much how I get to articles that need improvement, and I guess most folks begin their Wikipedia careers. And her oppose to [[Samuel Johnson's early life]] at TFAR was just as perplexing, claiming no one really knows or cares about Johnson. If that is not why Wikipedia exists and FAs go on the main page then someone please point out to me what is the true purpose of this site. ... ::My recurring point is that not only would someone have to follow her edits, but they would have to explain the most basic issues of policy that for editors with over 1,000 edits are taken for granted as implied and understood. It truly is a matter of economics: find someone with the time and energy to devote to this. Yet why should it fall on another editor? Where is the personal responsibility to adhere to community expectations? I am expected to behave myself and read up on policies where I don't know what is going on. When I make mistakes, others point them out to me. I learn or I stop making bad edits. Should this actually be explained to Mattisse? How basic really should this guidance be? I sound like I'm trying to throw wrenches in any plan to get started, but rather I'm trying to understand what a new plan might entail.]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Under the common integrals section I assume the book is referring to common formulae for anti-differentiation. If that is the case then mathematical convention would have them all followed by 'plus some arbitrary constant of integration'. More importantly the first example (the anti-derivative of a function in x scaled by a constant 'a' all with respect to a differential of x) is most definitely wrong. She has no simple anti-derivative as far as I know. There are of course local series approximations, but Taylor and her associates aren't really material for an introduction to integral calc. Perhaps 'Sdx af(x)' was meant? If so the formula is still wrong; integration is a linear operation so direct internal proportion is given by external scalar multiplication. I haven't done any calc since my junior year of high-school so this could all be wrong, but I'd appreciate the attention anyone could place upon the matter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter is an overview of the Anishinabe's relationship with the land where they lived.

==The land and the seasons==
[[File:Shovel Point1.jpg|thumb|right|Shovel Point on Lake Superior, part of the original homeland of the Anishinabe]]
The traditional homelands of the Anishinabe, the western half of the Great Lakes region, is heavily wooded and has a short growing season, long winters and poor soil. Therefore, any long-term agriculture would have been unsustainable on a large scale. Rather, the Anishinabe were hunter-gatherers who lived in harmony with the seasons and their land as a necessity. To have not done so would have surely meant starvation and death.

Southeastern Canada, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, the primary territories of the Anishinabe by the late 17th century, are heavily wooded both with deciduous and coniferous trees. Lakes, rivers and fresh water of all kinds is abundant, as is game, berries and other wild edibles. However, the winters can be bitterly cold and long and snow drifts and falls to heights of over ten feet in record years. Thus, the Anishinabe had to be careful not to overharvest and to preserve enough food to survive the winter.

In the spring, it was maple-tapping time; time to gather the sap that would be turned into maple sugar as a seasoning and preservative for other foods. In summer, huge groups of up to four hundred (though smaller gatherings of one to two hundred were far more common) gathered around the myriad lakes of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and the nearby regions of Canada in areas where resources were known to be plentiful. Fall was ricing time, wild rice being one of the primary sources of food for the Anishinabe. In the winter, it became necessary to break up into much small groups, usually twenty to twenty-five members of an extended family, a time of rest, storytelling and crafts when there was little else one could do in the cold.

==Maple sugar and wild rice: two food staples of the Anishinabe==
===Sugaring time===
[[File:Sugar Makak 1925.jpg|thumb|right|A sugar makak, often used to store maple sugar.]]

Between February and April, or the Anishinabe moon of ''Izhkigamisegi Geezis'' (Boiling Time), was the month of maple sugaring, an important ritual in the Anishinabe year that was celebrated more like a festival than work. Because of the climate of the area at that time of the year, balmy thawing days and freezing nights, the sap begins to flow freely in the maple trees, making collection much easier than at any other time of year. Traditionally, the signal for sugaring season to begin was the cry of the crow, signifying that another winter had passed and that the move to the sugaring camp could begin.

The first step was the construction of the camp. The traditional wigwam consisted of a sturdy frame built of bent green saplings lashed together with basswood fibers or another durable material, covered with strips of waterproof birchbark to keep out snowmelt and cold. There was an opening on the roof of the dwelling, to allow smoke to escape, and also a small door. The frames were left during the months between sugaring time, so that entire camps could be constructed in a day, in the same location year after year, by simply re-weaving the birchbark through the saplings. 

In addition, there was often a food cache located near the camp, full of food that had been stored in the fall. Though some supplementary fishing and gathering was necessary, usually done by the younger girls and boys, the focus was clearly on harvesting as much sap as possible to last through the year. Salt was rarely used by the Anishinabe, and so maple sugar was often the only available seasoning. Due to the fact that it takes between 30 and 40 gallons of sap to make a gallon of syrup, which then must be boiled down further to yield a scant 3 quarts of sugar, everybody was kept busy running back and forth gathering pails from the trees.

===Wild ricing===
They would take the canoe to the farmland and cut the rice branches off to acquire the wild rice.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I just changed &quot;r = m / n&quot; to &quot;r = m % n&quot; on the exercise to convert the optimized asm to an optimized C.

please see the comments on the edit. the reason why it is so is because if you look at line 7 on the disassembled source, you'll see that the code discards EAX (the quotient) and keeps EDX (the remainder) and puts it into ecx to compare it to 0 do get inside the loop. so if the code keeps the R and discards the Q that means it's doing a MOD not a division. Another reason why this is so is because if we keps &quot;r = m / n&quot; the code makes no sense at all, and also doesnt' work. [[User:Nothingist|Nothingist]] ([[User talk:Nothingist|talk]]) 07:50, 31 August 2009 (UTC)

== &quot;decompile optimized code&quot; example is wrong ==

&lt;code&gt;
 	mov	eax, esi
 	cdq
 	idiv	ecx
 ; Line 13
 	mov	esi, ecx
 	mov	ecx, edx
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
             m = n;
             r = m % r;
             n = r;
&lt;/code&gt;
According assembly code, &quot;mov ecx, edx&quot; to move new remainder to variable r must be after &quot;mov esi, ecx&quot; to move old remainder in variable r to variable n, but &quot;r = m % r&quot; destroys old remainder in variable r before moving it to n. --[[User:LungZeno|LungZeno]] ([[User talk:LungZeno|talk]]) 20:01, 20 August 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Datasheets for semiconductor products can be baffling even for the most experienced engineers and programmers, but those written for microcontroller or digital signal processing products are even more so. One of the challenges of writing a datasheet for such products is that, due to their programmable nature, diversity and flexibility, it is difficult to successfully separate out the raw data about the product and its peripherals from programming them and ultimately developing functioning applications based upon them.

Even those with several years experience on one family of products from one silicon manufacturer may have difficulty finding the information they are accustomed to in the documentation of an alternative silicon supplier. This is due to each manufacturer writing their documents in differing ways and even using varying terminology or acronyms for the same terms.

This guide aims to explain what type of information is split over which documents for the Microchip PIC family of microcontrollers and digital signal controllers from Microchip Technology which should help those making their first tentative steps with this broad range of controller products.

== Who is this written for? ==
This guide is written primarily for professional embedded developers who are moving to the Microchip range of controller products for the first time and need guidance on where to find the information they need to make informed decisions on the products' capabilities or how to program and use them. It is also ideal for those in higher education (both learning and teaching) to gain an insight into how technical information on complex silicon products is written and which details are to be found where. For those who take a personal interest in these products, but do not necessarily work in the embedded system profession, enlightenment may also be found as to why certain information is documented as it is and where.

== How this book is constructed ==
This book is split into three sections; the first is recommended reading for all those reading this book the for the first time and ensures that basic knowledge required to understand the rest of the book is clarified; the second section examines the documentation available for the different products on a controller family and sub-family basis, ideal for those making a start with a particular Microchip PIC device; the third and final section is a terms-based guide to documentation allowing those with previous knowledge (either with these products or those from an alternative supplier) to get quickly to the information they need, based upon the knowledge they already have.

The sections and their contents are:
* [[/Introduction to PIC microcontroller and DSC products|Section 1 - Introduction to Microchip PIC Microcontroller and DSC products]]
** [[/Introduction to PIC microcontroller and DSC products#Methodology behind PIC controller documentation |Methodology behind Microchip PIC Microcontroller and DSC documentation]]
** [[/Linking documentation to controller family|Linking documentation to controller family]]
** [[/Documentation structure|Controller and Development Documentation Structure]]
** [[/Documentation structure dev tools manufacturing|Development Tool and Manufacturing Documentation Structure]]
* [[/Section 2 - Processor-family based guide to documentation|Section 2 - Processor-family based guide to documentation]]
* [[/Section 3 - Term-based guide to documentation|Section 3 - Term-based guide to documentation]]

== Recommended prior knowledge ==
{{prerequisite|Embedded Systems}}
This book assumes the reader has a grounding in electronics, microcontroller architecture and programming, [[Embedded Systems/PIC Microcontroller | embedded systems]] or a combination of all three. Terminology common to these areas will be used without further definition or explanation.

I disagree with merging into Latex/Formatting. Then this chapter will get to long (printing to many sides and very long to scroll). At some places in the text it would be nice if there is a link which refers between this two chapters.

I disagree with merging. The stuff on lists in LaTeX/Formatting should probably be moved into a new section (what stands today as LaTeX/Numbering is just a collection of items to be discussed). There is plenty of stuff to discuss on plain text formatting in LaTeX! [[User:Vonbrand|Vonbrand]] ([[User talk:Vonbrand|talk]]) 00:34, 16 June 2010 (UTC)

I partially agree: Latex/Formatting describes fairly advanced tweaking of the formatting rules but is missing a crucial point: How to format a list (bullet or enumerated list). So anything that adds this topic will enhance that article. But both articles don't contaun any information how to tell latex to numerate a thing/ how to make a bullet list. And adding this sort of thing would make the &quot;formatting&quot; article rather long. --[[User:Peterpall|Peterpall]] ([[User talk:Peterpall|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Peterpall|contribs]]) 08:32, 4 June 2011 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Methodology behind PIC® controller documentation ==
Microcontrollers and digital signal processors (DSPs) are challenging products to document. On the one hand, the semiconductor vendor has to describe the functionality of the device's processing core, the functionality and possible settings of peripherals and the electrical and packaging specifications of the device. This description needs to concentrate on the raw functionality of the device's circuitry and the registers which they form. For example, a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) peripheral's functionality, as described in a datasheet, focuses upon, among other things, setting up the related transmit and receive pins of the device for use as a serial interface, how to calculate the required baudrate settings and how to enable parity support.

On the other hand, raw details on functionality and setup alone cannot inform a developer how to use that peripheral, processor or other feature in an actual application. Using our UART example again we know that a UART can be used in a variety of serial interfacing standards such as RS-232 and RS-485 amongst others. In addition that standard may have standardised software layer with which it is commonly used (for example ANSI escape sequences used with VT100), and a common circuit layout external to the controller to implement the required signalling (for example a MAX-232 family transceiver used with RS-232).

A further challenge documenting controller products is due to their infinite flexibility, as programmable products, and the fact that the software can be written in a variety of different programming languages using a broad range of software tools from different vendors of which some, or perhaps none, come from the silicon vendor themselves.

Lastly there is the issue of the software programs and hardware tools used for creating and debugging the firmware for the controller and the programming tools used for small production runs or mass-production.

As a result, datasheets alone typically contain around 100 pages, often running to several hundred pages, and in the interest of keeping the size of the datasheet manageable, much common and implementation or application specific data is located in various other documents with names such as &quot;Family Reference Manual&quot;, &quot;Application Note&quot; or &quot;Programming Specification&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some notes to share before the reading on Isocrates. Underlying questions: 1) the &quot;righteousness&quot; of [rhetorical? sophist?] historiography. Why do rhetoricians do history? 2) Is Vitanza's Isocratean problematic fair? worthy of attention?

From Victor Vitanza, ''Negation, Subjectivity, and the History of Rhetoric'':

Given my predispositions, I find Isocrates' notion of ''Panhellenism'' to be highly problematic. It becomes a forerunner of &quot;manifest destiny&quot; and of the Third Reich; it has within it the conditions of a philosophy/rhetoric of history and politics that is imperialistic. Panhellenism is a dangerous ''master trope.'' To be sure, there will be many readers who will argue that my comparison between Panhellenism and the Third Reich is too metaleptic, or too anachronistic. In a way they are correct; yet in other ways, deeply &quot;mistaken&quot; (Burke 1984, 41). (140)

...Georges Mathieu, in ''Les Idee Politiques d'Isocrate''(1925), points to an &quot;analogy&quot; between Isocrates's ''panhellenisme du ive siecle'' and ''pangermanisem'' of the twentieth century; Mathieu specifically says that many German historians begin to employ easily Isocrates' views to justify Third Reich ambition (destiny?, fascisms) ''to unite'' (by way of expulsion, purging) all of the Germanies and the rest of the continent beyond (218-222). The grand narrative goes: Today, Germany; tomorrow, the world! Greeks and Germans. Germans and Greeks! Such an ungrand narrative must be, cannot not be--I will incite right here and now and everywhere--responded to. (141)</text>

==Hi Folks&quot;==
I am only an occasional editor, and I have a lot to learn. My main activity is teaching English in Madrid, Spain. Visit my page on Wikipedia for more. My main problem for the moment is inserting references. My main pleasure is trying to make articles international, neutral and readable. Thanks for the welcome!

== Keep it simple, PLEASE. ==

I know you're trying to help, but please stick to ancient civilisations. Kids do NOT like long, boring introductions. They want brief but interesting ones, like the ones Terry Deary writes in his ''Horrible Histories'' series. You gave a brief overview of the history of the world, from the Stone and Metal Ages to the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, but you ended up not mentioning the bit between the Iron Age and the medieval times: The time of ancient civilisations.

As I read your reworked introduction, I was also beginning to suspect that your definition of 'ancient' was different from mine. So, I would like to define the term here:

&lt;big&gt; After the historic times has begun in an area (since all civilisations need a language), but BEFORE THE MEDIEVAL TIMES. And, in the case of the eastern world, say, BEFORE THE HAN DYNASTY IN CHINA.&lt;/big&gt;

I hope you could write a more concise and to-the-point introduction. Thanks, '''[[User:Kayau|&lt;span style=&quot;color:navy&quot;&gt; Kayau &lt;/span&gt;]]''' ''[[User talk:Kayau|David Copperfield]]''  [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;MOBY DICK&lt;/span&gt;]]  &lt;small&gt; [[:w:User:Kayau/guestbook|the great gatsby]] &lt;/small&gt;  03:02, 18 January 2010 (UTC)

You have reason - I have used lots of sub-headings - any other contributors out there? [[User:Timpo|Timpo]] ([[User talk:Timpo|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Timpo|contribs]]) 11:14, 29 November 2012 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Ingredients==
*1.5 cups flour
*3.5 teaspoons baking powder
*1 tablespoon white sugar
*1 egg
*1¼ cups milk
*1 teaspoon salt
*3 tablespoon melted butter

==Procedure==
Sift together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk; add to flour mixture, stirring only until smooth. Blend in melted butter. If the batter seems too thick to pour, add a little more milk. Cook on a hot, greased griddle, using about ¼ cup of batter for each pancake. Cook until bubbly, a little dry around the edges, and lightly browned on the bottom; turn and brown the other side.</text>

==Ingredients (version 2)==
===Salad===
*Lettuce
*Cabbage
*Scallions (green onions)
*cherry tomatoes
*sour cream and onion flavored nishnashim crackers
===Dressing===
*5 cloves of garlic, crushed (use less if they’re big)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Ingredients==
*Lettuce
*cucumbers
*peppers
*cherry tomatoes.
*I then put in browned chop meat (you can fry it in either oil or water)
*Add crunched up doritos.
===Dressing===
The dressing is Salsa, Mayo (I wouldn’t say equal parts, I’d say a bit more Salsa) and garlic powder. 

==Procedure==
Mix together and pour on top.
That’s it.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
If you like it more spicy, you can use the BBQ doritos or the less mild salsa.
I’ve seen people add really authentic taco type things like corn, avocado, black olives, etc.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The rendering engine in Revit was vastly improved in the 2009 version. This chapter should be expanded upon to discuss the new engine.

==Alpha Channel==

When a rendering is exported in the TIFF file format, the sky area is saved as an alpha channel. This makes it very easy to strip out in Photoshop to be replaced with a background image of your choice.

*Export your rendering as a TIFF file.
*Open the TIFF file in Photoshop.
*You won't have any layers in your document (and you need these to have a transparent background), so double click the background layer in the layers pallette. *This will turn the background into a new layer (through a dialogue box).
*In the Select menu, choose Load Selection...
*Ensure that the document is correct (the same as the one you are working on)
*Ensure that the Channel is Alpha 1
*Select the Invert check box if you want the selection to be the sky. Otherwise the selection will be the foreground.
*Use &quot;New Selection&quot; as the operation
*Choose OK
*If your selection is the sky, hit the delete button and the sky will disappear. If your selection is your building, choose Copy and then you can paste the building into another Photoshop file that has a background image.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Whenever we argue, we argue in common. This is perhaps most clear when we engage in counter-argument. In our courts of law, we hear &quot;objection!&quot; as a request to introduce counterargument. Counter-argument engages with objections a composer imagines will bother a reasonable reader. Counter arguments need not only come from the imagination, although the imagination is a fine place to search for them. Dialogue is another tool we can use to discover and work with counter arguments. Note that counter arguments include obections as well as reasons for the objection.

[[File:WLANL - MicheleLovesArt - Tropenmuseum - Shiva Nataraja (6274-1).jpg|thumb|right|Nataraj, the dancing form of Lord Shiva, is a symbolic synthesis of the most important aspects of Hinduism]]
Hinduism is the oldest of all religions practised in the today's world. It is generally believed to have originated around 2000 BC to 1500 BC; though archaeological evidence in the form of religious artifacts (the discovery of a seal known as the proto-Shiva at the site Mohenjo-daro, dated to 2,700 BC) may point to an earlier era. Hinduism has a vast corpus of religious texts and no one text is considered to represent Hinduism solely. The earliest works are collected under the generic title of &quot;''The Vedas''&quot; meaning: The Knowledge. The four Vedas: ''The Rig Veda'', ''Sama Veda'', ''Yajur Veda'' and ''Atharva Veda'' are sacred texts containing hymns, incantations, and rituals from ancient India.  The two great epics, ''The Ramayana'' by Valmiki and ''The Mahabharata'' by Ved Vyasa are also considered sacred texts of Hinduism. A Portion of the ''Mahabharata'', the ''Srimad Bhagavad Gita'', is one of the most revered texts in modern India. It contains the preachings of Lord Krishna to Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. It describes How to ascent an ordinary man to divinity and enjoy absolute Bliss.

Hinduism may be considered more a way of life, rather than a religion. Hindu ritual practice is the method used for proclaiming that one is a Hindu and theological studies, though important, remain secondary in relation to the rituals. It is an amalgamation of different theories, beliefs and philosophies. There are two popular beliefs ''Dvaita'' and ''Advaita''; the principles of Duality and Non-Duality respectively. The Duality principle states that God and mortals are two different beings. The Non-Duality principle professes that all life forms are inter-connected with the Supreme Being - the concept of ''Parmatma''. Duality principle states that Paramathma and inner self (soul) of all living things are one and the same.Even 'Charvaks' who challenged even the existence of God, are considered part of Hinduism. None of the ancient text mentions the word Hindu, the only term used by them is 'Dharma' or the guidelines for a human being in that particular role. One may consider it to be the most open and democratic form of system where ideologies can move in-out or get modified any time. The text forming the basis of Hinduism are written by many and in different periods. None of them alonem can define this religion in totality. All of them deal with one or few aspects of it. Because of this flexibility and fluidity this religion could withstand the trial of times.  
  

According to Hindu Philosophy reaching God or attaining ''Moksha'' is an individual act.  The semitic religions may stress the need to follow a particular individual or prophet who acts as a vassal of God's will and the acceptance of an authoritative religious text; for example the Bible or the Koran.  Hinduism teaches that there is no particular way or book to reach God or Heaven.  The Hindu philosophy &quot;''Sarvadeva Namaskara Kesavamprathi Gattchathi''&quot; means that you can worship in any way or form you choose, for all are true paths that lead to God. The Guru in Hinduism is a person who instructs others in religious matters and worship. Hindus consider Gurus to be guides who show the path to God. 

The Rishis, ancient sages who performed religious rituals and services for the well-being of society,  are believed to be the earliest receivers of the Vedas. Hindu texts derived from revelation are called ''Sruti''. The Vedas is believed to be the absolute truths discovered by the Rishis and transmitted from gurus to disciples and passed on to each successive generation. Hindus believe that ''Sruti'' establishes that there is purpose in creation and there is some other reality beyond the visible physical world. Hindus consider that the self (''aham'') is an illusion and that by reading the Holy Scriptures or receiving instruction, a person will realize that there is a purpose to their birth and their present &quot;state of being&quot; in the world. Hindus believe that a person's &quot;state of being&quot; is the result of good or bad deeds in an earlier birth and that when a person dies, it is only the body that perishes. The soul (''atman'') will regain entry into the world through a cyclic rebirth that may manifest itself in any form of living matter.

''Sruti'' is a Sanskrti word which means 'what is heard' and ''Smrti'' means 'what is remembered'. Later on when people started using ''Tada Patra'' (in Sanskrit, ''Tada'' is the name of a tree and ''Patra'' means leaf, hence leaf of the tree Tada, which was quite big in size and suitable for writing and recording texts on; some manuscripts written on the leaf of the Tada tree can still be found in Indian Museums) these ''Srutis'' and ''Smrtis'' were recorded in a literary form. Hinduism has a wide ranging body of work that are called ''Tikas'' and these works present a critical analysis and interpretation of the ''Vedas'', ''Srutis'' and ''Smrtis'' texts. ''Tika'' in Sanskrit roughly translates as commentary or criticism.
[[File:Hindu marriage ceremony offering.jpg|thumb|right|The Bride and Bridegroom making an offering during a Hindu marriage ceremony ]]
One of the ''Smrtis'', the ''Manu Smrti'', is the oldest source of law still in use in India. Many Hindu religious texts of ancient origin are still used as a reference point for decisions about the social and judicial life of contemporary Indians . The current Hindu Marriage Act section 5 and other related sections, which is about the solemnization of Hindu Marriages, is a modern interpretation of the ancient vedic Hindu Law. Other sections of the Hindu Marriage Act dealing with Divorce are secular and  have no relation to Vedic law. In Hindusim, marriage is a religious sacrament in which the bride severs her knots with the ''gotra'' of her father's family and joins the ''gotra'' of her husband's family and this sacrament cannot be reversed. Though Hinduism forms the basis of the laws and customs of India, the secular approach of Indian politics has ensured that modern ideas can still be adopted. 

The other main religions in India share a common past with Hinduism. The Sikh Religion reveres some of the Hindu scriptures and Saints and there have been many exchanges of religious ideas between Hinduism and the other two ancient religions of India: Buddhism and Jainism. Hinduism has much in common with the ancient religions of Greece and Rome, in that its adherents are discouraged from orthodox dogma as long as piety and worship of the Gods is proven by the act of partaking in rituals. For Hindus, the ''Vedas'' scriptures describe the concepts of ideal conduct and the correct way of living one's life. The Holy Book of Hindus - ''Srimad Bhagwad Gita'' - preaches a way of life. The way which one must follow to attain ''Moksha''; to free oneself of the wordly constraints and to remove oneself from the cycle of rebirth.

Three early deities form the core of Hindu worship - Bhagwan Brahma (the Creator), Bhagwan Vishnu (the Preserver) and Bhagwan Mahesh (or Shiv, the Destroyer). Bhagwan is Sanskrit for God or Lord.

Hinduism has undergone many changes during the twentieth century. It has responded to the creation of a secular democratic modern India by adopting new ideas and practices and still continues to play a major role in the lives of its adherents.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Coding ==
Most people think that compression is mostly about coding. Well at one time it was. Before information theory, people spent years developing the perfect code to store data efficiently. To understand the limits of coding as a compression mechanism, we have to understand what coding is.

[[Image:Wikipedia in binary.gif|thumb|256px|right|&lt;font color=&quot;white&gt;The [[C++ Programming/ASCII|ASCII binary]] translation of the word Wikipedia morphs into the English translation.&lt;/font&gt;]]
The computer really understands only one type of data, strings of 0s and 1s. You know 0 is off, 1 is on, and all that rot.these actually have to do with the state of a memory cell, where 0 is a low voltage output of the cell, and 1 is a slightly higher voltage. The actual voltage spread involved is getting smaller as the size of the circuits gets smaller and the voltage needed to jump the gap between parallel circuits gets smaller.

Hardware configuration used to define the size of a code, by limiting the number of bits as the two state memory element is called, that could be moved at a single pass. An example is the 4bit 8bit, 16bit 32bit, 64bit, and now 128bit architectures found during the development of microcomputers.

Now essentially everything in a computer is stored as sequences of bits. The storage capacity of the computer is limited by how many of those bits, are wasted. Ideally we don't want to waste bits, so we tend to use codes that minimize the number of bits that are wasted for any particular architecture of computer they will run on. The ultimate code is the code that covers the exact amount of variations that are possible in a data type, with the least amount of wasted bits.

It is interesting to find that this is not a consideration in the human brain, in fact we have had to define a term to explain the redundant information carried in the codes for the brain, and that term is degenerate coding, a pejorative term that really just means that there is more than one code for the same information.

Consider a string of numbers, that mean something. Are they a string of digits, in which case we want to code them to minimize the storage for each digit, An integer value, in which case we want to code them to minimize the storage for an arbitrarily sized integer, A floating point value, in which case we want to code them to minimize the storage for an arbitrarily sized mantissa, and include information on what power the number is raised to, and how many bits past the point we are going to store. Or an address string in which case we want to code it to minimize the number of bits it takes for a character in a specific language.

To a human all of these different types of storage look the same on the printed page. But it takes time to convert between the different types of storage, so you might not want to translate them into the tightest coding possible while you are using them. However later when you want to store them away for posterity, it looks like a good idea to compress them down to the smallest size possible. That is the essence of compression.

== limits to coding density ==

So the limit to coding density, is determined by the type of data, you are trying to code and also by the amount of information that is available from a separate location.

As an example, the military have the practice to limit radio chatter during a campaign, this is often considered good thing. Even taking it to the point of limiting themselves to a click on their mike, to trigger the next phase of the attack. To a person who is fully briefed on it, a click on a mike will be all that is needed to send a wealth of information about the state of the operation. The event will have no meaning to the enemy waiting in the trenches, so that the first evidence they have of attack is when guns start going off.

Ideally all storage could be achieved in one bit files that contained whole encyclopedias. In actuality that is not likely to happen. Coding is still important, but it is very limited in what it can now do for compression. New algorithms for compression are increasingly hard to come by, hence the path of specialization on the source data new approaches take, true advances have recently been reduced to the hardware where the code will run.

{{NOTE|As a side note, regarding information density, consider the mathematical theory that every thing can be found represented in some form at a specific section of [[w:Pi|Pi]] (a mathematical constant, whose decimal representation never ends or repeats). This would permit that if a fast enough computation of the number was possible, the simple information regarding the boundaries of the significative section would serve to represent an extremely large block of information. That would indeed be information with a large density ratio.}}

== bits, bytes, symbols, pixels, streams, files ==
{{Rquote|right|Suffice it to say that real compression algorithms are a complex technology, bordering on an art form.|Leo A. Notenboom|[http://ask-leo.com/should_i_use_windows_file_compression.html ]}}

In the field of data compression, it is convenient to measure the &quot;size&quot; of data in terms of the fundamental unit of data: bits.

[[Image:PrimitiveTypes.png||right|3 basic common primitive types char,short int,long int.]]

Many data compression algorithms produce a compressed data stream that is a stream of bits -- with no particular alignment to any other size.

It is sometimes convenient to consider the input data in terms of &quot;symbols&quot;.
Some algorithms compress English text in terms of the symbols from an input and process them converting them in a reversible representation on the compressed output. Symbols are usually sets of bits but they in turn can represent any type of character representation/encoding, even pixels or waveforms.

When compressing CD-quality audio, the symbols are the 2^16 possible amplitude levels -- the 2^16 possible physical positions of the speaker cone.

Some file compression utilities consider the uncompressed file in terms of 257 different symbols. At any point in the file, the &quot;next symbol&quot; could be any one of 257 symbols: one of the 256 possible bytes -- or we could have already reached the end of the file, the 257th symbol indicating &quot;end-of-file&quot;.

When comparing image compression routines, sometimes the term &quot;bpp&quot; (bits per pixel) is used. An uncompressed full-color bitmap image is 24 bpp. An uncompressed 2 color bitmap image (containing only black pixels and white pixels) is 1 bpp. Some image compression algorithms can compress some images to much less than 0.1 bpp.
The same image compression algorithm may be doing pretty good to compress some other image to 7.5 bpp.

== fixed-length coding ==

== variable-length coding ==

With variable-length coding,
we can make some symbols very short -- shorter than any fixed-length encoding of those symbols.
This is great for compressing data.

However, variable-length coding almost always end up make other symbols slightly longer than best fixed-length encoding of those symbols.

Using more bits store a symbol sounds ridiculous at first --
Why don't we simply store a shorter fixed-length version of such symbols?

OK, yeah, *other* symbols could be shorter.
So ... why can't we use the variable-length version when that would be shorter,
and use the fixed-length version when that would be shorter?
The best of both worlds?
Perhaps use a &quot;1&quot; prefix to indicate &quot;the fixed-length representation follows&quot; ?

{{todo|
Put a simple intuitive answer to the above questions here.
Hold off on abstract mathematical proofs until we get to the entropy coding section.
}}

We discuss variable-length coding in more detail in the [[Data Compression/Order/Entropy|entropy coding]] section of this book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Models in Compression ==

After Information Theory showed how to build a perfect code for any specific symbolic system, people found that it was relatively easy to come up with new coding conventions for new types of data, and the digital revolution was on. At one point it was wondered just what couldn't be stored in a computer.

It was about this time, that scientists started looking for more extraordinary ways to reduce storage costs. One scientist hit on a solution. He said, if we model our data, we will find that certain patterns develop in the data. If we can code the longest and most prevalent patterns with the shortest codes and the shorter patterns with less prevalence with longer codes, we can reduce the size of a file without losing any data.

Unfortunately what he found was that the model needed to optimize the length of a file in one type of data was not the same as the model needed to optimize the length of a file in another type.

Another scientist noticed that when he looked at the binary codes of his data, there were strings of repetitive patterns. Why not, he said, abstract out the patterns, and simply count how many of them ran in a row and code the file so that the code efficiently handled statistically significant numbers of repetitions. So for instance consider a letter on a paper. Using this technique all white space that consisted of blanks would be reduced to a single space, and a number to indicate how many were needed to fill out the line.

In each of these cases, the scientist modelled their data, and used something they recognized in their model to significantly reduce storage. The model was what gave them the leverage to reduce the storage size without losing information.

Now a cautionary note, I once worked with a man that had great ideas about how to encode data.
He wanted to develop a compression scheme that could be re-entered and compress even further. But his chosen technique didn't include a model of how encoding the data changed the data. He is still looking for a model today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Dictionary Compression ==
[[Data Compression/Coding#limits to coding density | Remember]] the wealth of information a soldier gets from a mike click? With certain types of data, it makes sense that if you could encode the data using information that is not stored in the actual datafile you are compressing, you could significantly reduce known forms of storage and the requirements for communication. Some algorithms replicate process by including an internal data table, often referred to as dictionary, hence the term ''dictionary compression''.

{{NOTE|The word dictionary in this case does not relate to the programming structure that holds the data table. Some authors and implementors may refer to this type of concept as library (and then library compression), in that case library does not refer to the code implementation file.&lt;br&gt;
This can become confusing since the algorithm relies on an internal data storage container that references the information that may in really not be what programmers define as a dictionary, also adding to it is the fact most compression algorithms tend to be implemented into as programming object libraries files, so the algorithm can easily be reusable and updated. }}

Due its intrinsic characteristic of permitting gains when used in communications, as the example of the mike click demonstrates, there is a pre-understood code system agreed and shared between the emitter and the receptor. It is not without a cause that most communication network oriented compression algorithms rely in some form of dictionary compression.

{{TODO|This should be extended a bit, keeping it inside the scope by inclusion of some mentions of communication protocols V.42bis using Lempel Ziv dynamic dictionary compression, V.44 uses LZJH (Lempel-Ziv-Jeff-Heath) adaptive data compression.}} 

An example is a simple dictionary built into the compression algorithm scheme. If you already know the most compact storage scheme for a specific type of data, then you can simply substitute the more compact state for the actual data. Consider the word &quot;supercalifragiliciousexpialadocious&quot; Now suppose that in your dictionary there are only 11 words starting with super, and this is the eleventh. Well its obvious that Super11 would be unique enough that given the same dictionary at the time of decompression, you could recover the full word with no data loss. With A and An, however it is not quite so obvious that you could store information about the word in less space than everything but the one letter word.

Now consider that you have the Internet, and you want to store an article by LaVogue. You could store the file on your own computer, or, alternately you could store a link to the file similar to the hypertext links you have on your homepage. Is it compression? Maybe not, but you can recover the original text with a slight delay while it downloads.

The mind boggles at the efficiency of a compression system that contains all knowledge in the world on a single server-farm, and uses it to reduce the storage of information on the client computer. Even more fantastic would be the legal snarl such a system would create and the privacy concerns and financial costs associated with recovery of compressed information that was proprietary in the first place. But a net-aware compression server, might be able to achieve truly radical compression rates. Essentially all that the home file would have to contain was the key sequence to trigger the decompression of a specific data cloud. The home user could even compress his compression files because multiple files each containing a link to a specific compression file structure, could be themselves turned into a single file, that contained the compression file structure of all the composite files. Infinite compression at the user level, but truly massive storage at the server level.

== non-adaptive dictionary compression ==

== Text compression using 4 bit coding ==

Pike's 1981 compression algorithm, like several early text compression algorithms, used a more or less literal dictionary of English words.

Pike's algorithm used a fixed dictionary composed of 205 of the most popular English words, and the ASCII characters.
By using a variable-length coding of 4, 8, or 12 bits to represent these words and the remaining ASCII characters, and some clever handling of uppercase letters and the space between words, Pike's algorithm achieved a compression ratio of 3.87 bits per character for typical English text.
&lt;ref&gt;
J. Pike.
[http://comjnl.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/4/324.full.pdf &quot;Text compression using a 4 bit coding scheme&quot;].
1981.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Adding more English words to the dictionary helps compression, but with diminishing returns.
Adding certain non-words to the dictionary -- common letter pairs and triplets, common prefixes, common suffixes, etc. -- helps compression, since they can be used to at least partially compress words that aren't in the dictionary, but adding such non-words also gives diminishing returns.

Later compression algorithms kept the idea of a short codeword representing something longer, but generalized it: a dictionary coder expands codewords to a sequence of bytes, a sequence that may or may not line up on English word boundaries.

== Smaz ==

Smaz is a simple compression library suitable for compressing very short
strings, such as URLs and single English sentences and short HTML files.&lt;ref&gt;
https://github.com/antirez/smaz#readme
&lt;/ref&gt;

Much like Pike's algorithm, Smaz has a hard-wired constant built-in codebook of 254 common English words, word fragments, bigrams, and the lowercase letters (except j, k, q).
The inner loop of the Smaz decoder is very simple:
* Fetch the next byte X from the compressed file.
** Is X == 254? Single byte literal: fetch the next byte L, and pass it straight through to the decoded text.
** Is X == 255? Literal string: fetch the next byte L, then pass the following L+1 bytes straight through to the decoded text.
** Any other value of X: lookup the X'th &quot;word&quot; in the codebook (that &quot;word&quot; can be from 1 to 5 letters), and copy that word to the decoded text.
* Repeat until there are no more compressed bytes left in the compressed file.

Because the codebook is constant, the Smaz decoder is unable to &quot;learn&quot; new words and compress them, no matter how often they appear in the original text.

== Adaptive dictionary algorithms ==

Most dictionary algorithms are adaptive: rather than a fixed, hard-wired dictionary like Pike's algorithm, as the decoder compresses the text, when it encounters letter triplets or entire words that are not yet in the dictionary, the decoder adds them to the dictionary.

If there are too many rare triplets, syllables, or words in the dictionary,
it increases the codeword size of the more common ones, hurting compression ratio.
If some triplet, syllable, or word is left out of the dictionary,
then when it does occur, it cannot be represented by a simple dictionary reference
and must be spelled out using more bits, also hurting compression ratio.
This balancing act makes it difficult to build an optimal dictionary.&lt;ref name=&quot;kuthan &quot; &gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The hard-wired dictionary used to initialize the data compression algorithm has a big effect on the compression ratio in the early phase of the compression.
An adaptive dictionary algorithm eventually adds to the dictionary all the syllables and common words used in that specific text,
and so the initial hard-wired dictionary has little effect on the compression ratio in later phases of the compression of large files.&lt;ref name=&quot;kuthan &quot; /&gt;

== LZ77 algorithms ==

LZ77 type decoders expand the compressed file by expanding &quot;copy items&quot; in that compressed file into larger strings.
This enables &quot;duplicate string elimination&quot;: only the first copy of a string is stored in the compressed file.
All other copies refer to a previous copy.

These decoders have the general algorithm:
* Is the next item a literal? Then copy it directly from the compressed file to the end of the decoded text.
* Is the next item a copy item? Then break it into a &quot;length&quot; and a &quot;distance&quot;. Find the text that starts that &quot;distance&quot; back from the current end of decoded text, and copy &quot;length&quot; characters from that previously-decoded text to end of the decoded text.
* Repeat from the beginning until there is no more items in the compressed file.

While all LZ77 style algorithms have this same decoder structure, there is a huge variety of ways that decoders decide whether an item is a literal or a copy items, and also a variety of ways that they extract the &quot;length&quot; and the &quot;distance&quot; from the copy item.

Many decoder algorithms combine LZ77 with other compression ideas.
As of 2008, the most popular LZ77 based compression method is called DEFLATE; it combines LZ77 with Huffman.
We will discuss it later.

=== LZSS and LZRW1-A ===
Lempel-Ziv-Storer-Szymanski (LZSS) was created in 1982 by James Storer and Thomas Szymanski.
LZRW1-A was published in 1991 by Ross Williams.

The LZSS and LZRW1-A decompressors have a very similar form:

For each copy item, fetch a &quot;literal/copy&quot; bit from the compressed file.
* 0: literal: the decoder grabs the next byte from the compressed file and passes it straight through to the decompressed text.
* 1: copy item: the decoder grabs the next 2 bytes from the compressed file, breaks it into a 4 bit &quot;length&quot; and a 12 bit &quot;distance&quot;. The 4 &quot;length&quot; bits are decoded into a length from 3 to 18 characters. Then find the text that starts that &quot;distance&quot; back from the current end of decoded text, and copy &quot;length&quot; characters from that previously-decoded text to end of the decoded text.
* Repeat from the beginning until there is no more items in the compressed file.

=== LZJB ===
The LZJB&lt;ref&gt;
[http://src.opensolaris.org/source/xref/onnv/onnv-gate/usr/src/uts/common/os/compress.c LZJB source code]
&lt;/ref&gt;
decoder fetches a &quot;literal/copy&quot; bit from the compressed file.
* 0: literal: the decoder grabs the next byte from the compressed file and passes it straight through to the decompressed text.
* 1: copy item: the decoder grabs the next 2 bytes from the compressed file, breaks it into a 6 bit &quot;length&quot; and a 10 bit &quot;distance&quot;. The 6 &quot;length&quot; bits are decoded into a length from 3 to 66 characters. Then find the text that starts that &quot;distance&quot; back from the current end of decoded text, and copy &quot;length&quot; characters from that previously-decoded text to end of the decoded text.
* Repeat from the beginning until there is no more items in the compressed file.

{{NOTE|At first look, a 2-byte &quot;copy&quot; in LZRW1A and LZJB algorithms may seem to not save any space, because the 16 bits to indicate &quot;length, distance&quot; are the same size as 2 literal bytes. However, 2 literal bytes actually require 18 bits including the &quot;literal/copy&quot; bits, while a 2 byte copy requires 17 bits. Even so, the 2 byte copy was either overlooked or not considered worth the effort by the authors of those algorithms.}}

After pulling a 1 bit from the control word, a copy item is in only one format:
* LLLLLLdd dddddddd : copy L+3 bytes from d bytes before the most-recently-decoded byte.

=== LZ77 ===
LZ77&lt;ref&gt;
Jacob Ziv and Abraham Lempel; [http://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/spring03/cps296.5/papers/ziv_lempel_1977_universal_algorithm.pdf ''A Universal Algorithm for Sequential Data Compression''], IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 23(3), pp.337-343, May 1977.
&lt;/ref&gt;
The original LZ77 decoder fetches a &quot;distance/length/literal&quot; block from the compressed file.

The LZ77 decoder algorithm is:
* Find the text that starts that &quot;distance&quot; back from the current end of decoded text, and copy &quot;length&quot; characters from that previously-decoded text to end of the decoded text. (Sometimes the &quot;length&quot; is 0, so this &quot;copy&quot; does nothing).
* Then copy the literal character from the compressed file to the end of the decoded text.
* Repeat from the beginning until there is no more items in the compressed file.

=== BARF ===

The &quot;BARF&quot; archiver&lt;ref&gt;
[http://cs.fit.edu/~mmahoney/compression/barf.html &quot;Better Archiver with Recursive Functionality (BARF)&quot;] by Matt Mahoney
&lt;/ref&gt;
(when it's not cheating) uses a simple byte-oriented LZ77-like code.
The inner loop is:

* Fetch a byte X.
** X in the range 0...31? Literal: copy the next X literal bytes from the compressed stream to the end of the decoded text.
** X in the range 32...255? Copy item: copy the two bytes from X-32 places back in the decoded text.
* Repeat from the beginning until there is no more items in the compressed file.

=== LZF ===
LZF is a fast compression algorithm that takes very little code space and working memory (assuming we have access to the most recent 8 kByte of decoded text).

LibLZF by Marc Lehmann is designed to be a very small, very fast, very portable data compression library for the LZF compression algorithm. 

{{TODO| Is LZF  also developed by Marc Lehmann ?.}}

[http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2010/10/entry_432.html]
[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-6389]

LZF is used in [[w:TuxOnIce|TuxOnIce]] and many other applications.

The LZF decoder inner loop is:
[https://github.com/ijuma/h2-lzf/blob/master/src/main/voldemort/store/compress/lzf/LZFDecoder.java]
[http://code.google.com/p/h2database/source/browse/trunk/h2/src/main/org/h2/compress/CompressLZF.java]
[http://ampify.it/amp.lzf.lzf.html]
For each copy item, the LZF decoder first fetches a byte X from the compressed file, and breaks the byte X into a 3 bit length and a 5 bit high_distance.
The decoder has 3 cases: length==0, length==7, and any other length.
** length == 0? (i.e., X in the range 0...31?) Literal: copy the next X+1 literal bytes from the compressed stream and pass them straight through to the current location in the decompressed stream.
** length in 1...6 ? short copy: Use that value as length (later interpreted as a length of 3 to 8 bytes).
** length == 7? long copy: fetch a new length byte and add 7. The new byte could have any value 0 to 255, so the sum is 7 to 262 (which is later interpreted as 9 to 264 bytes).
** Either kind of copy: Fetch a low_distance byte, and combine it with the 5 high_distance bits to get a 13-bit distance. (This implies a 2^13 = 8KByte window).
** Either kind of copy: Find the text that starts that &quot;distance&quot; back from the current end of decoded text, and copy &quot;length+2&quot; characters from that previously-decoded text to end of the decoded text.
* Repeat from the beginning until there is no more items in the compressed file.

Each LZF &quot;item&quot; is one of these 3 formats:
* 000LLLLL &lt;L+1&gt;               ; literal reference
* LLLddddd dddddddd            ; copy L+2 from d bytes before most recently decoded byte
* 111ddddd LLLLLLLL dddddddd   ; copy L+2+7 from d bytes before most recently decoded byte

=== FastLZ ===
FastLZ by Ariya Hidayat is a free, open-source, portable real-time compression library for the FastLZ algorithm.
''(Ariya Hidayat apparently developed the FastLZ algorithm based on the LZF algorithm?)''
FastLZ is a drop-in replacement for Marc Lehmann's LibLZF.
It has pretty much the same compressed size and compression time as LibLZF, and significantly faster decompression -- about 2/3 the time of LibLZF.
&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.fastlz.org/lzf.htm &quot;replacing liblzf with FastLZ&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-6349 Hadoop: &quot;Implement FastLZCodec for fastlz/lzo algorithm&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The FastLZ decoder inner loop is very similar to the LZF inner loop:

* Fetch a byte X. Divide the byte X into the 3 bit length and a 5 bit high_distance.
** length == 0? (i.e., X in the range 0...31?) Literal: copy the next X+1 literal bytes from the compressed stream to the end of the decoded text.
** length in 1...6 ? Copy: Use that value as length (later interpreted as a length of 3 to 8 bytes).
** length == 7? Copy: fetch a new length byte and add 7. The new byte could have any value 0 to 254, so the sum is 7 to 261 (which is later interpreted as 9 to 263 bytes).
** (When the new byte is all-ones (255), it serves as an escape to even longer lengths ...)
** Fetch a low_distance byte, and combine it with the 5 high_distance bits to get a 13-bit distance. (This implies a 2^13 = 8KByte window).
** If the distance is all-ones (0x1FFF): fetch 2 new distance bytes to give a full 16 bit distance, and add it to the 0x1FFF all-ones distance. (This implies a 2^16 + 2^13 = 64 KByte + 8 KByte window)
** find the text that starts that &quot;distance&quot; back from the current end of decoded text, and copy &quot;length+2&quot; characters from that previously-decoded text to end of the decoded text.
* Repeat from the beginning until there is no more items in the compressed file.

If a compressed file only uses distances within the 2^13-1 window, and lengths less than 2^8+7,
both the FastLZ and the LZF decoders will produce the same decompressed plaintext.

Each FastLZ &quot;item&quot; is one of these 5 formats (the LZF formats, plus a few extensions):
* 000LLLLL &lt;L+1&gt;               ; literal reference
* LLLddddd dddddddd            ; copy L+2 bytes from d bytes before most recently decoded byte
* 111ddddd LLLLLLLL dddddddd   ; copy L+2+7 bytes from d bytes before most recently decoded byte
* LLL11111 11111111 dddddddd dddddddd ; copy L+2 bytes from d+0x1FFF bytes before most recently decoded byte
* 11111111 LLLLLLLL 11111111 dddddddd dddddddd ; copy L+2+7 bytes from d+0x1FFF bytes before most recently decoded byte

''It's not clear why FastLZ is so much faster than LZF. It's &quot;extensions&quot; are apparently not being used, since the compressed file sizes on the benchmark files are not significantly different.''
''If the same implementation techniques -- 16-bit copies whenever possible, special-case for &quot;run&quot; (pseudo-RLE), etc. -- were applied to LZF, would it be just as fast?''
''Or is it the case that these &quot;extensions&quot; actually are being used a lot, and somehow they are faster (but roughly the same size) as the LZF approach?''

=== miniLZO ===
{{TODO|Complete miniLZO.}}

LZO is a compressed data format and portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C developed and maintained by Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Wikipedia: Lempel–Ziv–Oberhumer]]
&lt;/ref&gt;
LZO is slightly slower and produces somewhat better compressed file sizes than LZF.
LZO is much faster than DEFLATE/gzip -- it runs in about half the time -- and produces somewhat worst file sizes than DEFLATE/gzip.
[http://h5py.alfven.org/lzf/]

miniLZO is a lightweight subset of the LZO library.

=== LZS ===
LZS: Lempel–Ziv–Stac compression.
LZS compression is specified for various Internet protocols,
including
RFC 1967, RFC 1974, RFC 2395, and RFC 3943.&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.ietf.org/ietf-ftp/IPR/hifn-ipr-draft-friend-tls-lzs-compression.txt
&lt;/ref&gt;
Stac Electronics sued Microsoft for infringement of LZS patents.
Since then, several of those patents have expired.

The LZS decoder fetches a &quot;literal/copy&quot; bit from the compressed file.
* 0: literal: the decoder grabs the next byte from the compressed file and passes it straight through to the decompressed text.
* 1: copy item: the decoder grabs the next bit from the compressed file.
** That bit selects how many bits of &quot;distance&quot; to pull from the file:
*** 1: the decoder grabs a 7 bit &quot;distance&quot;.
**** If this distance is the nonsensical value &quot;0&quot;, it really represents the end-of-message. Exit the loop.
*** 0: the decoder grabs a 11 bit &quot;distance&quot; (this implies a 2 kibiByte sliding window).
** Then the decoder grabs a &quot;length&quot; value from the compressed file.
*** However, the length is not encoded in a fixed-length field, but in a variable-length pattern:
*** 00 represents length 2
*** 01 represents length 3
*** 10 represents length 4
*** 1100 represents length 5
*** 1101 represents length 6
*** 1110 represents length 7
*** 1111 0000 represents length 8
*** 1111 0001 represents length 9
*** 1111 1111 0010 represents length 25
*** In general, except for the first 6 special cases listed above, &quot;1111&quot; repeated N times followed by 4 more bits that represent a value Y in the range 0...14, are decoded into a length value (N*15 + Y - 7).
** Then find the text that starts that &quot;distance&quot; back from the current end of decoded text, and copy &quot;length&quot; characters from that previously-decoded text to end of the decoded text.
* Repeat from the beginning, until the special &quot;zero distance&quot; value was decoded.

The complex variable-length encoding technique used in LZS allows &quot;recent&quot; byte pairs to be compressed into 11 bits, and even &quot;less recent&quot; byte pairs, as long as they are in the 2 kibiByte sliding window, to be compressed in 15 bits.
This variable-length encoding technique is one of several kinds of &quot;universal code&quot;, one of many kinds of &quot;fixed Huffman encoding&quot; tables, which we discuss in the [[Data Compression/Order/Entropy | Entropy]] chapter of this Wikibook.

In text files, repeated pairs are far more common than longer repeated strings.
LZS gives at least 1 bit of compression on this common form of redundancy.
This gives LZS an advantage over compression algorithms which are unable to compress repeated strings shorter than 3 characters, and so must store such short repeats as-is, or even expand them by a bit.

=== Snappy ===

The &quot;Snappy&quot; algorithm is tuned for very high speeds (even at the cost of mediocre compression).
On benchmark files, Snappy is an order of magnitude faster than zlib
but compressed files 20% to 100% bigger than zlib.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://code.google.com/p/snappy/ Snappy in C++]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Snappy is faster than LZF.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://github.com/dain/snappy#readme Snappy in pure Java]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The inner loop of the &quot;Snappy&quot; decompressor
decodes &quot;elements&quot; that always begin with a tag byte in one of these formats:

* xxxxxx00 ; literal follows
* xxxxxx01 ; copy with 1-byte offset
* xxxxxx10 ; copy with 2-byte offset
* xxxxxx11 ; copy with 4-byte offset

Details:

* LLLLLL00 &lt;L+1&gt; ; where L in 0..59: literal reference for 1...60 (inclusive) literal bytes.
* LLLLLL00 &lt;L-59&gt; &lt;length&gt; ; where L in 60..63: these special &quot;lengths&quot; indicate 1, 2, 3, or 4 bytes, respectively, of actual length bytes follow the tag byte. Those length bytes are followed by the literal itself.

* dddLLL01 dddddddd ; copy with 1-byte offset: copy L+4 bytes from d bytes before the most recently decoded byte. ''(Why L+4, giving lengths 4..11 ? Would L+3, giving lengths 3..10, give better compression? Perhaps even L+2 allowing us to copy the occasional byte pair?)''
* LLLLLL10 dddddddd dddddddd ; copy with 2-byte offset: copy L+1 bytes from d bytes before the most recently decoded byte.
* LLLLLL11 dddddddd dddddddd dddddddd dddddddd ; copy with 4-byte offset: copy L+1 bytes from d bytes before the most recently decoded byte.

=== PalmDoc ===
PalmDoc combines LZ77 with a simple kind of byte pair compression.
PalmDoc Algorithm:
&lt;ref&gt;
PalmDoc Algorithm
[http://kobesearch.cpan.org/htdocs/EBook-Tools/EBook/Tools/PalmDoc.html]
[http://search.cpan.org/~azed/EBook-Tools-0.3.3/lib/EBook/Tools/PalmDoc.pm]
&lt;/ref&gt;

PalmDoc files are decoded as follows:

* Read a byte from the compressed stream. If the byte is
** 0x00: &quot;1 literal&quot; copy that byte unmodified to the decompressed stream.
** 0x09 to 0x7f: &quot;1 literal&quot; copy that byte unmodified to the decompressed stream.
** 0x01 to 0x08: &quot;literals&quot;: the byte is interpreted as a count from 1 to 8, and that many literals are copied unmodified from the compressed stream to the decompressed stream.
** 0x80 to 0xbf: &quot;length, distance&quot; pair: the 2 leftmost bits of this byte ('10') are discarded, and the following 6 bits are combined with the 8 bits of the next byte to make a 14 bit &quot;distance, length&quot; item. Those 14 bits are broken into 11 bits of distance backwards from the current location in the uncompressed text, and 3 bits of length to copy from that point (copying n+3 bytes, 3 to 10 bytes).
** 0xc0 to 0xff: &quot;byte pair&quot;: this byte is decoded into 2 characters: a space character, and a letter formed from this byte XORed with 0x80.
* Repeat from the beginning until there is no more bytes in the compressed file.

== dictionary algorithms ==
{{wikipedia|dictionary coder}}
=== fixed byte pair encoding ===
The simplest dictionary algorithm is byte pair encoding with a fixed dictionary of byte pairs (a bigram dictionary).

Simple byte-pair encoding, also called dual-tile encoding or DTE,
is often used to compress text in video game ROMs.&lt;ref&gt;
RedComet.
[http://www.romhacking.net/documents/142/ &quot;Dual-Tile Encoding: NES/Famicom Implementation&quot;].
&quot;Dual-Tile Encoding (commonly referred to as DTE in
[[w:ROM hacking#Hex editing romhacking]] circles)&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;

A byte pair decoder assumes that English text uses only a relatively small &quot;alphabet&quot; of letters and symbols.
A byte pair decoder assumes that certain bytes never occur in English language text (the &quot;high&quot; bytes 0x80 to 0xFF and a few other bytes).
When the &quot;impossible&quot; bytes occur in the compressed text, the decoder looks that byte up in a fixed dictionary, and emits the corresponding pair of bytes.
Otherwise, the decoder copies the compressed byte to the plaintext more or less as-is.
Often the 0x00 byte marks the end of the compressed string, so standard C string-handling routines can be re-used to handle compressed text.
The dictionary should include all the most-frequent letter pairs used in the plaintext (&quot;th&quot;, &quot;he&quot;, &quot; t&quot;, etc.).
There are several different implementations of this algorithm, each one using a different (incompatible) dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;

=== byte pair encoding ===


DTE can be decoded in a single pass -- each byte of compressed text is either a &quot;normal&quot; printable character that stands for itself,
or else it is a &quot;unprintable&quot; byte that stands for exactly two normal printable characters.
Recursive byte pair encoding loosens that restriction:
With recursive byte pair encoding, a &quot;unprintable&quot; byte
stands for two bytes.
Sometimes both of those two bytes are normal printable characters, just like DTE.
Sometimes one or both bytes may be (some other) &quot;unprintable&quot; byte,
requiring repeated decoding passes until only printable characters remain.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://blog.blockos.org/?cat=6 &quot;Alice’s bubbles (Part 2)&quot;]

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;
[[Wikipedia: byte pair encoding]]
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SCZ byte pair encoding ===

SCZ is a dynamic byte pair algorithm and compressed format developed by Carl Kindman, who released one implementation and its test suite under a LGPL license.&lt;ref&gt;
Carl Kindman.
[http://scz-compress.sourceforge.net/ &quot;SCZ - Simple Compression Utilities and Library&quot;].
&lt;/ref&gt;

The SCZ compressed format is a series of segments.
Each segment has a few bytes of header and footer, including a iteration count and a checksum, surrounding a repeatedly-compressed block.

The inner loop of the SCZ decoder is given a dictionary of 256 entries, and a special escape symbol.
The inner loop scans through a block of &quot;compressed segment data&quot; and generates a new uncompressed block something like this:
* Read the next byte from the compressed block.
* If the byte read is the special escape byte, discard the escape byte and read the following compressed byte as a literal byte, and write that literal byte to the decompressed block.
* Otherwise look up that byte in the dictionary.
** If the byte is a &quot;marker character&quot;, the dictionary has a byte pair to replace it with -- write those 2 bytes to the decompressed block.
** Otherwise the dictionary indicates the byte is a literal byte -- write the byte read to the decompressed block.
* Repeat until no more data in the compressed block.

The &quot;escape byte&quot; makes it possible to compress a file that has a byte pair repeated many times, even when the file already uses all 256 possible byte values -- the compressor deliberately expands some rare byte into two bytes (the escape byte and the rare byte),
in order to re-use that rare byte as a &quot;marker byte&quot; to represent that byte pair (compressing each instance of those two bytes into one byte).

The middle loop of the SCZ decoder is given an iteration count and a block of data.
The middle loop and generates the corresponding plaintext something like this:
* If the iteration count is zero, the rest of the block is fully decompressed data -- done!
* Read the header from the compressed block
** read a byte from the compressed block; this byte becomes the new escape symbol.
** Read the symbol count N, and read N dictionary entries into a dictionary. (Each entry is 3 bytes: the &quot;marker&quot; byte as stored in the compressed text, and the pair of bytes it represents in the uncompressed text.
* Pass the escape symbol, the dictionary, and the rest of the compressed block (the compressed segment data) to the inner loop, decompressing it to an uncompressed block.
* swap the (now-empty) compressed block with the uncompressed block.
* Decrement the iteration count and repeat from the beginning.

The outer loop of the SCZ decoder breaks the file up into a series of segments,
breaks each segment up into a header (which contains the iteration count, among other things),
a block of compressed data (which the outer loop passes to the inner loop for decoding),
and a footer (which contains a checksum used to detect problems).

{{NOTE|A common misconception is that data compression algorithms can compress practically any block of data.
That leads to the common misconception that repeated applications of a compression algorithm will keep shrinking the data further and further.

The vast majority of compression algorithms squeeze as much as they can in a single iteration.
Applying a second iteration (attempting to produce a &quot;double-compressed&quot; file) almost invariably produces a file that is larger than the first compressed file; further iterations only make it worse (larger).
SCZ is one of the few compression algorithms that takes multiple iterations.
But even a SCZ compressor eventually reaches minimum size; further iterations only make the &quot;compressed&quot; file worse (larger).

=== LZ78 algorithms ===

LZ78

=== LZW ===

A well-known example of the dictionary based technique is the LZW data compression, since it operates by replacing strings of essentially unlimited length with codes that usually range in size from 9 to 16 bits.

The LZW algorithm, as used in the GIF file format, is perhaps the most famous and controversial compression algorithm.

While decoding a codeword to a &quot;word&quot; of 1 or more letters and emitting those letters to the plaintext stream,
a LZW decompressor adds a new &quot;word&quot; to the dictionary.
The new word is the concatenation of the previously-decoded word and the first letter of the word represented by the current codeword.

Larger codewords allow larger dictionaries, which typically improves compression.&lt;ref name=&quot;dipperstein&quot;&gt;
[http://michael.dipperstein.com/lzw/ &quot;Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) Encoding: Discussion and Implementation&quot;]
by Michael Dipperstein
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;
[[Wikipedia: Lempel–Ziv–Welch]]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==== GIF ====
The GIF file format typically starts with 9 bit codewords
and gradually increases the width of the codeword, as necessary, up to a maximum codeword width of 12 bits.
Many GIF implementations statically allocate a dictionary with 2^12 = 4096 dictionary entries, one for each possible codeword.

==== LZMW ====
LZMW (1985) by V. Miller, M. Wegman is a modification of LZW.

While decoding a codeword to a &quot;word&quot; of 1 or more letters and emitting those letters to the plaintext stream,
a LZMW decompressor adds a new &quot;word&quot; to the dictionary.
The new word is the concatenation of the previously-decoded word and the entire word (possibly the same word) represented by the current codeword.
This allows dictionary entries to grow in length much more rapidly than LZW.

==== LZAP ====
LZAP (1988) by James Storer) is a modification of LZMW.

While decoding a codeword to a &quot;word&quot; of 1 or more letters and emitting those letters to the plaintext stream,
a LZAP decompressor adds at least 1 and often more new &quot;words&quot; to the dictionary.
The new words are the concatenation of the previous match with every initial substring of the current match. (&quot;AP&quot; refers to &quot;all prefixes&quot;).
For example, if the previous match is &quot;com&quot; and the current match is &quot;press&quot;,
then the LZAP decompressor adds 5 new &quot;words&quot; to the dictionary:
&quot;comp&quot;, &quot;compr&quot;, &quot;compre&quot;, &quot;compres&quot;, and &quot;compress&quot;,
where LZW would only add &quot;comp&quot;, and
LZMW would only add &quot;compress&quot;.

This allows the number of words in the dictionary to grow much more rapidly than LZW or LZMW.

==== LZWL and word-based LZW ====

In 2005, Jan Lánský introduced syllable-based compression.
.&lt;ref name=&quot;kuthan &quot; /&gt;

The LZWL compressor uses a syllable detector to divide the plain text into syllables.
&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

[http://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/Publications/CEUR-WS/Vol-176/paper5.pdf &quot;Syllable-based Compression for XML Documents&quot;].
&lt;/ref&gt;
When the LZWL decompressor pulls a &quot;phrase index&quot; from the text,
it adds a new phrase to the dictionary -- formed from the entire previous phrase concatenated with the first syllable of the current phrase.

A similar &quot;word-based LZW&quot; divides the plain text into English words (in general, alternate maximal strings of alphanumeric characters and non-alphanumeric characters).&lt;ref&gt;

by Nigel Horspool and Gordon Cormack.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Character-based compression seems to give better compression with smaller files;
word-based compression seems to give better compression with larger files.
Some researchers suggest that syllable-based compression methods
might give better compression with intermediate-sized files --
such as HTML pages.&lt;ref name=&quot;kuthan &quot; /&gt;

{{TODO|Does the decompressor need to use the syllable detector?&lt;br&gt;
Is there any limit on the number of plaintext bytes in a syllable?}}

==== LZW implementation tips ====

The dictionary used by the decompressor doesn't really need to store a literal string
for each dictionary entry.
Since each dictionary entry is composed of
some previous dictionary entry concatenated with a single character,
all the decompressor needs to store for each entry is an integer and a character:
the index of some previous dictionary entry, and a literal suffix character.
&lt;ref name=&quot;dipperstein&quot;/&gt;

This same compact dictionary also works with LZAP.
With LZMW, rather than each entry storing a single suffix character,
it will instead store a second integer: the index to some, possibly the same, previous dictionary entry.

It's usually simpler and faster for the decoder to special-case decode any codeword with a value less than 256,
and immediately output the literal byte it represents,
rather than go through the motions of looking up such a codeword in the dictionary.
&lt;ref name=&quot;dipperstein&quot;/&gt;

Some LZW compressors use a hash table to rapidly map the next few plain text characters to a dictionary entry.
This works about the same as the hash table used to speed up LZ77-style compressors.

Some implementations of LZW and other LZ78 variants use a special search tree that takes advantage of the dictionary structure.&lt;ref&gt;

=== LZX ===
(We discuss LZX in a later chapter, [[Data Compression/Order/Entropy#LZX]])

=== Reduced offset Limpel Ziv (ROLZ) ===

The above LZ77 variations of LZ77 encode a linear, uncoded, fixed-length offset.
The possible values of that offset at any particular instant of decoding often include many values that will *never* be used.
For example, once the decompressor pulls a copy length of 4, it may see dozens of copies of &quot;the &quot; and &quot;and &quot; in the text, but it knows that the compressor will always pick the most recent one -- all the values of the offset that select some other copy of &quot;the &quot; or &quot;and &quot; will never occur.

If we could somehow &quot;skip over&quot; those impossible offsets, we could encode the offset in fewer bits, and still be able to use the same (offset,length) phrase that the above LZ77 encoders would use.

Also, many possible values of the offset are highly unlikely to occur.
For example, once the decoder finishes emitting a phrase that ends in &quot;ch&quot;,
in normal English text the next character is almost never another consonant.
So all the offsets that point to a phrase starting with some consonant will almost never be used.
By skipping over those highly unlikely offsets, we could encode the offset of the next phrase in fewer bits,
and almost always be able to copy the same (offset, length) phrase that the above LZ77 encoders would use.
(In some rare cases, the above LZ77 encoder picks some phrase that a ROLZ algorithm deems &quot;unlikely&quot; and skips over, forcing us to copy some other, shorter phrase; but hopefully sacrificing a few bits in those situations is paid back in saving a few bits in almost every other situation).

By &quot;reduced offset&quot;, we mean that we have reduced the number of bits in the compressed file used to select a particular offset, when compared to using a linear, uncoded, fixed-length offset.
We do *not* mean that the maximum possible offset is reduced -- in fact, most ROLZ compressors can copy a phrase from a much more distant offset than the typical 2^10 or 2^12 byte limit of linear, uncoded offsets.

Using something other than a linear, uncoded, fixed-length offset necessarily requires more computation at decode-time to translate that compressed selection value to the actual position in the decompressed-so-far text.
This is yet another tradeoff between speed and compression ratio.

Ross Williams points out that all LZ77 and LZ78 algorithms can be cast into the form of Markov algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;

by Ross Williams 1991
&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcolm Taylor wrote one (the first?) implementation of ROLZ as part of the WinRK compression suite.
Ilia Muraviev wrote the first open-source implementation of ROLZ compression.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.ezcodesample.com/rolz/rolz_article.html &quot;Anatomy of ROLZ data archiver&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

LZRW3-a
Of all the compressors in the LZRW series of &quot;fast&quot; data compressors,
the LZRW3-a(8)
gives the best compression on the large text benchmark.
Unlike most other ROLZ compressors,
it completely ignores the most-recently-decoded byte of plaintext context.
The inner loop of the LZRW3-a decoder first fetches a &quot;literal/copy&quot; bit from the compressed file.
* 0: literal: the decoder grabs the next byte from the compressed file, which represents itself. Pass it straight through to the decompressed text. Every literal byte is &quot;interesting&quot;, so a pointer to this byte is (eventually) added to the &quot;table of 2^12 interesting locations in the previously-decoded text&quot;. Hopefully next time this byte can be copied as part of a long phrase via that pointer, rather than laboriously spelled out with literals again.
* 1: copy item: the decoder grabs the next 2 bytes from the compressed file, which represents a phrase. The decoder breaks it into a 4 bit &quot;length&quot; and a 12 bit selector.
* The 4 &quot;length&quot; bits are decoded into a length from 3 to 18 characters.
** It uses that 12 bit selector to pick a location from the &quot;table of 2^12 interesting locations in the previously-decoded text&quot;, and copies length characters from that location to the end of the decoded text. Also: add to the table a pointer to the beginning of this phrase.
* Repeat from the beginning until there is no more items in the compressed file.
LZRW3-a(8) tries to (approximately) preserve the 8 most-recent instances of every 3-byte phrase that occurs in the plaintext.
(The specific details of which partition the decompressor adds the pointer to,
and the pseudo-random replacement used to discard old pointers when a partition is full,
are beyond the scope of this document).
(In effect, the decompressor expands a 12 bit code to a 20 bit uncoded offset into the 1 MB plaintext buffer).
''(too much detail)''



LZRW4 (Ross Williams, 1991) can be seen as a kind of ROLZ algorithm.
Rather than a linear, uncoded offset for each phrase,
the offset is represented by a 5 bit value.
At the start of each phrase, the LZRW4 decoder
hashes the two previous characters to obtain a partition number.
The 5 bit value selects one of the 32 pointers in the context-selected partition.
That points to some previously-decoded location in the 1 MB plaintext buffer.
(In effect, the decompressor has expanded the 5 coded bits to a 20 bit uncoded offset).
Then the decompressor pulls 3 bits from the compressed text and decodes that into 8 possible length values (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,16), then copies the selected (offset,length) phrase to the plaintext.
Then the context partitions are updated.
Because a &quot;copy item&quot; is only 9 bits (flag bit + offset selector + length), it does a good job compressing common byte pairs.
Literal items are also 9 bits (flag bit + literal octet).
(To increase speed, Williams doesn't store a pointer to *every* time a 2-byte context occurs in the partition table, but only the 2 byte contexts that occur at the *end* of some phrase).
(To reduce memory use,
Williams doesn't keep track of the *exact* 2-byte context using 2^16 partitions, but instead hashes the 2 previous bytes of context into a 12 bite context with 2^12 partitions).
''(too much detail ...)''


Perhaps the most extreme form of &quot;reduced offset&quot; is to reduce the offset to zero bits.
This special case of ROLZ is called LZP.

=== LZP ===

LZP compression was invented by Charles Bloom.&lt;ref name=&quot;campos&quot;&gt;
[http://www.arturocampos.com/ac_lzp.html &quot;Lzp&quot;]
by Arturo San Emeterio Campos 1999
&lt;/ref&gt;
A LZP decompressor examines the current context (perhaps previous 3 bytes),
finds the most recent occurrence of that context in the plain text (or some approximation),
and uses only that one fixed offset.
That gives us an extremely short compressed phrase (a flag bit + a match length).
In some cases, that one fixed offset is the same one that LZ77 would have used -- in these cases, we've saved a lot of bits because we didn't store the offset.
In other cases, that one fixed offset is not exactly the same one that LZ77 would have used, but a larger offset that gives us exactly the same copied phrase -- likewise, we've saved lots of bits.
Inevitably, sometimes that one fixed offset gives us fewer useful bytes than the offset LZ77 would have chosen -- in the worst case, zero useful bytes.
LZP requires more bits to encode those bytes than LZ77 would have done in that situation.
But overall, LZP typically compresses better than LZ77.

A few implementations make sure the context table always points exactly to the most recent occurrence of every 3 byte context -- this requires updating the context table on every byte the decompressor emits.
Many LZP implementations approximate this by only updating the table at the start of a phrase or literal, skipping the updates for all the bytes copied during that phrase.
That speeds up decompression, and Arturo San Emeterio Campos&lt;ref name=&quot;campos&quot; /&gt; claims it actually improves the compression ratio on longer files, although it hurts the compression ratio on shorter files.

A LZP decoder works something like this:
* Look up the current context in the context table to get the Position. If this context has *never* occurred before, then we have a literal. Otherwise, fetch a &quot;literal/copy&quot; bit from the compressed file.
* (In either case, remember that Position, but update the context table to point to the current location in the decompressed text. The next time we have the same context, we get this location, rather than that less recent Position)
* 0: literal: the decoder grabs the next byte from the compressed file and passes it straight through to the decompressed text. 
* 1: copy item: the decoder grabs a few bits from the compressed file and decodes them into a length. Starting at the Position where this context occurred before, copy &quot;length&quot; characters from that previously-decoded text to end of the decoded text. Then grabs the next literal byte from the compressed file and passes it straight through to the decompressed text.
* Repeat from the beginning until there is no more items in the compressed file.


Some documents&lt;ref&gt;
http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text.html
&lt;/ref&gt;
describe a byte-oriented version of LZP:
* Look up the current context in the context table to get the Position. (Remember that Position, but update the context table to point to the current location in the decompressed text. The next time we have the same context, we get this location, rather than that less recent Position).
* Fetch the next byte from the compressed text.
* If this context has *never* occurred before, *or* the fetched byte is not the escape byte, then we have a literal; otherwise, we have a copy item. (The compressor should have picked a value for the escape byte that occurs rarely in the plain text).
* literal: pass it straight through to the decompressed text.
* copy item: Discard the escape byte, and grab the length byte. Starting at the Position where this context occurred before, copy &quot;length&quot; characters from that previously-decoded text to end of the decoded text. Then grab the next literal byte from the compressed file and pass it straight through to the decompressed text, even if it happens to be the escape byte. (Occasionally the length will be 0, such as when the decompressed text *needs* to contain the special byte we use as the escape byte).
* Repeat from the beginning until there are no more items in the compressed file.

== Implementation tips and tricks ==

=== compressed format tips and tricks ===

Most data compression decompression algorithms are most naturally described in terms of reading the compressed file as an undifferentiated stream of bits (a bitstream).
Most programming languages do file I/O a byte at a time.

So decompression implementations typically keep a separate &quot;bit buffer&quot; (initially empty).
When you want to read a bit, if the bit-buffer is empty,
read a (byte-aligned) byte from the compressed bytestream, store the last not-yet-needed 7 bits in the bit-buffer,
and use the first bit.
Otherwise read the next bit from the bit-buffer.

Many file formats are designed to maintain &quot;8 bit alignment&quot;
(some even try to maintain &quot;16 bit alignment&quot;) wherever possible,
in order to speed things up by reducing the amount of bit-shifting.

Often when decompressing, you've read some odd number of bits, and the abstract decompression algorithm mentions something like &quot;read the next 8 bits and pass that literal byte directly to the output&quot;.
There are three possible ways to design a file format to handle &quot;read the next 8 bits&quot;:
* &quot;undifferentiated bitstream&quot;: get the remaining bits in the bit buffer, reload the bit buffer, and get a few more bits, then shift-and-align to re-assemble the byte.
* Throw away the remaining &quot;padding bits&quot; in the bit buffer, and simply read the next (byte-aligned) byte from the compressed bytestream. Faster than the bitstream approach, but the unused bits hurt the compression ratio, and so we will speak no more of this approach.
* &quot;byte aligned&quot;: Temporarily ignore the bit-buffer; read the (byte-aligned) byte directly from the compressed bytestream. (Only use the bit-buffer when the decompression algorithm reads a bit or two or seven).

Compared to an undifferentiated bitstream format, a byte-aligned format for compressed text is precisely the same number of bytes long and has exactly the same bits; the bits are merely arranged in a slightly different order.
So picking a byte-aligned format gives precisely the same compression ratio, and it often makes things faster.

=== compressor implementation tips and tricks ===

==== hash tables ====
The obvious way to implement a LZ77-style (offset, length) compressor involves scanning the entire window for a match to the following plaintext, for each and every phrase we eventually write into the compressed file.
Then picking the longest (and nearest) match.

The obvious way to implement a LZ78-style (dictionary entry) compressor involves scanning the entire dictionary for a match to the following plaintext, for each and every dictionary index we eventually write into the compressed file.

For a file of length N this is O(N) for each compressed phrase.
This requires O(N^2) to compress a file of length N.
(Schlemiel the Painter's algorithm).
(I'm assuming the LZ77 window covers at least half of the file, and assuming a roughly constant compression ratio).
This is excruciatingly slow.

Most LZ77-style and LZ78-style compressor implementations use a speedup trick:
Whenever they output a compressed phrase, they do a little O(1) &quot;extra&quot; work updating a [[Data Structures/Hash Tables | hash table]].
Then, instead of sequentially scanning the entire window for a match, they look up the following plaintext (typically the next 3 bytes) in the hash table.
In a hash table, searches immediately succeed or fail in O(1), and therefore it only takes O(N) to compress the entire file.
This is far faster.

Many LZ77-style compressors deliberately sacrifice the maximum possible compression in two ways:
(a) Some compressors only update the hash table once per phrase, rather than once per every byte.
(b) Some compressors use a direct-indexed cache -- a very simple hash table without collision detection -- the table remembers only the single most-recent item with that hash index -- rather than a standard hash table that remembers *every* item (so far) with that hash index.
Typically each of (a) or (b) hurts compression by a few percent, but can roughly double or triple the speed of the compressor.
Many LZ77 style compressors do both (a) and (b), hurting compression by a few percent, but getting roughly four or ten times the speed.

==== pseudo-RLE ====

RLE can be emulated with overlapping copies in most LZ77-like decompressors (&quot;pseudo-RLE mode&quot;).
The decompressor must use a method that handles such overlapping copies properly -- in particular, the decompressor must not use memcpy() or memmove() on such overlapping copies.
On some machines, it's faster to simply use the same &quot;copy one byte at a time&quot; copy_bytes() routine for all copies.
On other machines, programmers find that memcpy() is so much faster than that it reduces the total decompression time if the decompressor includes extra code that, for each copy item, decides whether it overlaps or not, and uses the slower copy_bytes() only when memcpy() won't work.

{{TODO| (Neither memcpy() nor memmove() are quite what we want here. See the comments of the &quot;IncrementalCopy&quot; function[http://code.google.com/p/snappy/source/browse/trunk/snappy.cc].) }}

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the cheapest ways to store larger amounts of water is by using water bags rather than drums.  An even cheaper way - if you have the space - is several plastic garbage cans with lids.  A thirty five gallon can at Home Depot is about 20 bucks in my neighborhood.  Just remember to tip them over and replace the water every six months or so.  Also advisable is a good filter like a Berkey to remove any odd tastes picked up from storing in the plastic cans.

==Historiographic Debates==

A number of the secondary sources below as well as the chapter &quot;Toward an Understanding of Sophistic Theories of Rhetoric&quot; above are either direct or indirect responses to the interpretive approach laid out by Vitanza in ''Negation, Subjectivity, and the History of Rhetoric.'' Leff (below) warns us that Vitanza's critique of negation itself (ironically) relies on negation. Consigny argues that Schiappa's interpretation of Protagoras as a foundationalist relies on a predilection for foundationalism.

The historiographical debates are themselves emerging as academic culture confronts/acknowledges/struggles with/incorporates postmodern critiques. Here I would stress that the University is ''the'' institution of the Modern Enlightenment, planned in part by one of the Enlightenment's chief parents, Immanuel Kant (see particularly Bill Readings, ''The University in Ruins'' 54-69). The debates between Vitanza, Poulakos, Jarratt, Schiappa, and Leff illustrate the complex and political disciplinary relationships between theory and practice. 

Schiappa recognizes the foundations of postmodern and poststructuralist critique of Modern historiography, however he remains confident in the possibility, and necessity, of &quot;historical reconstruction.&quot; He writes:

:[...] it is important for students of rhetoric to differentiate between two approaches to the study of the Sophists in ancient Greece. Those approaches can be described as the construction of neosophistic rhetorical theory and criticism, and the historical reconstruction of sophistic doctrines. (65)

He notes that both enterprises are matters of interpretation, and that &quot;since the goal of historical reconstruction is to recapture the past insofar as possible on its own terms, the methods of the historian and, in classical work, the philologist, are appropriate&quot; (66). He also concludes:

:I am not suggesting that historical reconstruction should be done to the exclusion of contemporary appropriation. With Rorty I believe that both ought to be done, but done separately. Otherwise, historical accounts tend to become self-affirming discoveries of early anticipations of voguish philosophical theories. (68)

In light of this passage, I would ironically highlight Consigny's critique of Schiappa, that he finds in Protagoras precisely what he hopes to find. But, in his afterword to the 2003 edition of ''Protagoras and Logos'', Schiappa addresses, if implicitly, this irony. Given the sophistication of the passage (every pun intended), it is worth attending to Schiappa at length:

:Although I have opinions on the relative merits of different assumptions about reading classical texts, at the moment I do not intend to argue that some theories are right and some are wrong. Rather, my point is that when we engage texts, we are looking for something, and what we are looking for--and what we ''notice''--is guided by beliefs that can be called theoretical. These beliefs create what I call ''rhetorical salience'' for specific features of a text. For nineteenth-century pragmatists, for example, what was rhetorically salient about Protagoras was his explicit humanism, his religious agnosticism, and what I have described previously as his &quot;objective realism.&quot; What was salient for me was how he took Heraclitean insights and advanced new modes of description that Moravcsik calls &quot;second stage compositional explanations (see chapters 5 and 6 of this book). As few and far between as Protagoras's fragments are, there has never been a shortage of alternative readings, each guided by what the scholar finds salient.
:That our readings are informed by our particular views and interests is hardly news, but it is my hope that the notion of rhetorical salience can help us better understand and make sense of competing interpretations. It may help us recognize that some readings rely on the salience of too little of a text (such as when Gorgias's whole career is reduced to his use of the term ''paignion'') and it may help distinguish the values and interests informing historical reconstructions and contemporary appropriations. My examples, I confess, are a bit self-serving, but they may prove useful. 
:For better or for worse, I learned early to expect a certain amount of veal and vehemence from my critics. For years I thought no one could top the ad hominem assault that met my earliest work, but since that time I have been likened twice to those Holocaust revisionists typically pilloried for their callous anti-Semitism. Aside from the pain such a description evoked, what I find significant about these two readings is that they came from opposite ends of the academic ideological continuum. 

Schiappa details how for poststructuralist critics such as Vitanza (see ''Negation, Subjectivity, and the History of Rhetoric'' 32-34) he represents an insistence upon &quot;an essentializing Aristotelian worldview&quot; (209), yet for traditionalist, objectivist historians, Schiappa's acceptance of social construction &quot;brand[s] [him] as a dangerous postmodernist&quot; (209). 

No doubt that Vitanza's description of Schiappa's project is violent, even if it is not &quot;vengeful&quot; (see Vitanza 33). And, certainly, Vitanza's comparison of Schiappa to a Holocaust denier goes too far. 

But I would also argue that Schiappa either misrepresents, or fails to grasp, the extent of Vitanza's critique. Underlying Vitanza's neologisms is a calling into question of the entire epistemological project encompassing Modernity--(including, of course, recovering knowledge of the past). It is not simply an argument that the past ''cannot'' be recovered (which both scholars seem to note), but rather that the past ''should not'' be recovered--that the desire to recover ''the'' past &quot;has or will have created for human beings dangerous situations&quot; (''Negation, Subjectivity, and the History of Rhetoric'' 157). 

Recall that Vitanza isn't interested in producing knowledge (nor, he tells us, accurate history in the foundationalist-positivist-modernist notion of the term). Vitanza argues, channeling Derrida, that the future comes before the past (or, via Heidegger, we might say that all time extends outward, in both directions, from the present, see ''N, S, HoR'' 142). As such, for Vitanza, there is no access to past events as they transpired. Rather than attempting to search for such &quot;holy&quot; (Ideal, transcendental, divine) grounds, we are better off acknowledging and living within the &quot;limitations&quot; of our human, kairotic existence (an existence, Protagoras reminds us, that is exceedingly short).

While an extensive exploration of rhetorical historiography might seem an odd way to introduce Protagoras, Gorgias, and the sophits, I hope to show that there is a method to my madness. 

==Negative Portrayals of the Sophists==

Schiappa opens his study of Protagoras by tracing the etymology of the term sophist--paying particular attention to Plato's dissociative rhetorical strategy; Plato conceptualizes and promotes philosophy by distinguishing it from (a rather hollow) notion of mere ''sophia'': sophistry. Schiappa:

:The fact that the term ''sophistês'' was used disparagingly prior to Plato's writings does not, however, decrease the significance of his role in reconceptualizing the word. Plato's dialogue ''Sophist'' is the first recorded attempt to provide a systematic definition to the question &quot;What is a Sophist?&quot; Plato's interlocutors agree that a sophist is 1) a paid hunter after the young and wealthy, 2) a kind of merchant of knowledge of the soul, 3) a retailer of these same wares (perhaps implying that the knowledge is sold in small qualities), 4) a seller of his own productions of knowledge, 5) an athlete in contests of words--specifically disputation (''eristikê''), and, though the speakers are dubious, 6) a purger of souls ,who removes opinions that obstruct learning through ''elenchus'' (231d-e). [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_Elenchus#Method Link to Wikipedia discussion of Elenchus]]

Schiappa also notes that sophistry was a foil for Aristotle as well, and that ultimately &quot;Aristotle considered a Sophist as one who &quot;misuses&quot; the art of dialectic in order &quot;to deceive&quot; (7). 

==Schiappa on Protagoras==

Schiappa dedicates a chapter to each of Protagoras' major fragments: the two-''logoi'', the stronger and weaker, the human-measure, the impossible to contradict, and the concerning the gods. 
===two-logoi===
two-logoi can be interpreted as either &quot;one every question there are two speeches, which stand in opposition to one another&quot; (Gomperz) or &quot;In every experience there are two ''logoi'' in opposition to each other&quot; (Untersteiner) (90-91, see 93 for Schiappa's explication of ''logoi''). [the question &quot;where does it come from&quot; transforms into the more abstract &quot;what is it made up of&quot;? 95, Schiappa notes that Protagoras follows Heraclitus in thinking that things come from unities, and break into pairs--thus, for Schiappa, Protagoras sets up what will be Aristotelian and Platonic metaphysical abstraction 95-97]
===the stronger and weaker===
the stronger and weaker fragment can be interpreted pejoratively or positively. The perverse, pejorative interpretation (credited primarily to Aristotle) frames Protagoras as teaching an unscrupulous form of manipulation (103-105). The positivist interpretation &quot;was the strengthening of a preferred (but weaker) ''logos'' for a less preferable (but temporarily dominant) ''logos'' of the same &quot;experience&quot; (109). Schiappa Points to Plato's positive depiction of Protagoras and a key passage from ''Theaetetus'' 166-167a).
===the human-measure===
the human-measure passage is often interpreted as &quot;of all things the measure is Man, of the things that are, that they are; and the of the things that are not, that they are not&quot; (118). Schiappa:
:The pivotal issue is: Was Protagoras contending that humans are the measure of &quot;how&quot; things are (essence), or that humans are the measure that determines &quot;that&quot; they are (existence)? Schiappa aims for a interpretation of &quot;that&quot; (existence) without existential (subjective) baggage; such: &quot;I translate the human-measure fragment as: 'Of everything and anything the measure [truly-is] human(ity): of what which is, that it is the case; of that which is not, that is not the case&quot; (121). 
Schiappa positions Protagoras's statement as a response to Parmenides and the Eleatics ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleatics Wikipedia page on Eleatics]):
:Parmenides' reasoning was either/or oriented. One could talk either about that which is or that which is not. The latter led to contradiction and incoherence, so only the first option was acceptable. Protagoras' reasoning was both/and oriented. Humans measure both what is and what is not. (125, see also 127 for an interpretation of Protagoras as a bridge from Parmenides to Plato). What is ultimately interesting regarding Schiappa's reading of Protagoras, in distinction to the work of Jarratt, Consigny and McComiskey with Gorgias, is that he doesn't believe Protagoras endorses what we might call a subjectivist metaphysic:
:If a choice has to be made, the arguments I have offered regarding the probability of Heraclitus' influence on Protagoras suggest that the &quot;objective&quot; label is superior. However, it is important to note the respects in which the subject/object dichotomy is inappropriate. There are no clear fifth-century terms equivalent to modern notions of subjective and objective. The well-known &quot;sophistic&quot; dichotomy between ''nomos'' and ''physis'' cannot be reduced to a subjective/objective dualism; even if it could, there is no clear evidence linking Protagoras to the ''nomos''/''physis'' controversy. Even in modern times &quot;subjective&quot; can imply a host of meanings with different philosophical implications. If the subject/object pair is reduced to the more concrete concepts of people and things, then Protagoras' answer is clear: the two are &quot;bound,&quot; &quot;things,&quot; can be &quot;measured&quot; by people in constrasting ways (''logoi''), and a dominant experience (''logos'') of a thing is potentially alterable as an interchange or swapping of opposites. (130)
===Impossible to Contradict===
As to the &quot;Impossible to Contradict&quot; fragment, Schiappa argues that the fragment is likely an alternative translation, extension, and commentary upon Protagoras's other fragments (139); it is a precursor to Aristotle's law of noncontradiction. 
===Concerning the Gods===
According to Schiappa, the final fragment &quot;concerning the Gods&quot; can be read either existentially or veridically (talk about a binary!). The existential view reads the line as introducing a work on agnosticism. The veridical view reads the line in context of Plato's ''Protagoras'' and sees it as opening an anthropological defense of religious practice (146).

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Sounds===
When we hear things, our ears are responding to tiny vibrations in the air, and converting them to brain signals. These air vibrations are called audio or sonic frequencies. They are a bit like waves on a pond - the air is compressed and stretched many times a second. How many times a second? The range is typically considered to be between twenty and twenty-thousand times a second. We write that as 20Hz - 20kHz in honor of a German physicist, Heinrich Hertz. The K is for &quot;Kilo, meaning &quot;multiply this by one-thousand&quot; Hz is one of the International Standards or SI Units.
==Speakers==
When we speak, we make the air in our larynx (plural larynges) vibrate at an audio frequency. The larynx is also  known as the voicebox in our throats. Electronic devices such as telephones and radios need &quot;speakers&quot; too. They make the air vibrate using a disk of stiff material called a diaphragm, which is vibrated by an electro-magnetic device called a transducer. Trans means to transfer, and ducto means to lead, so in this case, the phrase &quot;electro-mechanical transducer&quot; implies that electrical signals lead to mechanical movement. If audio-speakers are very small and do not make much noise we usually call them earphones or headphones. Loudspeakers tend to be rather bigger and, er, well louder!

==Audio Speakers==
Traditional earphones and speakers relied on a transducer made by an electro-magnetic coil suspended in a strong magnetic field. Today there are other types of transducers which use crystals, but for most speakers, the traditional design is common (although modern materials have greatly enhanced their performance). Actually, speakers and microphones are really quite similar, except that speakers generally have to move lots of air, and are therefore bigger and heavier than microphones, which have to detect rather weak sound-waves. 

Speakers and microphones can not follow the whole range of sounds we can hear, which is why in high-fidelity systems, there are tiny &quot;tweeter&quot; speakers to reproduce the high frequencies and big &quot;woofers&quot; for the low bass notes, as well as other mid-range speakers. If you hold your open hand near a woofer and turn up the volume, probably you will feel the low frequency sound waves.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===What is a camera??===
[[Image:Pinhole-camera.svg|thumb|Principle of a pinhole camera. Light rays from an object such as this tree pass through a small hole to form an image.]]
[[Image:IMG 1650 zonsverduistering Malta.JPG|thumb | Holes in the leaf canopy of a hedge or tree project images of the sun  on the ground during s solar eclipse.]]



The word camera comes from Latin and means &quot;room&quot; or &quot;chamber&quot;. The first camera was a very dark room with a tiny hole in the window shutter. Light passing through this 'pinhole' produced an image on the far wall that was bright and upside down. Someone had the bright idea of making a camera in a tower and adding mirrors. People in the dark room looked at a table, on which they saw the outside world projected - it produced a &quot;birds-eye view&quot; of their city. 

This was called a &quot;camera ''obscura''&quot;. The first one was made by a scholar called Ali Al-Hasan Ibn al-Haitham. He was born in Basra (now in southern Iraq) in about the year 1000 AD.

==Pinhole Camera==
Around 1600, Giambattista della Porta added a lens to the pinhole camera, but it was not until 1850 that a Scottish scientist, Sir David Brewster took the first actual photograph with a pinhole camera.

==Photography==
Photography is the result of combining several technical discoveries
* The pinhole camera
* Optical lenses
* Photo-chemical reactions
* Chemical development and stabilization of the image 
The first permanent photograph was an image produced in 1825 by the French inventor Nicéphore Niépce, but it took a very long time to produce. He teamed up with Louis Daguerre, and together they experimented with silver compounds based on a discovery made by a German Chemist Johann Heinrich Schultz in 1724, which was that a silver and chalk mixture darkens when exposed to light.


British scientist William Fox Talbot discovered another means to fix a silver process image but had kept it secret. He discovered sodium thiosulphate solution to be a solvent of silver halides in 1819 and was the first to commercialize photography and use the terms  &quot;negative&quot; and &quot;positive&quot;.

around 1900 Eastman Kodak of America mass produced the first popular black-and-white camera &quot;The Brownie&quot; which popularized low-cost photography and introduced the concept of the snapshot. The product was a very basic cardboard box camera with a simple lens. It used rolls of photographic film capable of storing about eight or a dozen images which could be developed and printed at most pharmacies, since initially they also sold the camera and film. The result was 2¼-inch (6cm) square black and white pictures of reasonable quality which faded unless stored in the dark. Photograph albums using dark, chemically inert paper were invented for this purpose.

The first modern color film using the &quot;three colored emulsion process&quot; was called Kodachrome, a popular product introduced by the Eastman Kodak Company in the United States of America around 1935.

Today, electronic cameras usually use an integrated circuit that scans each point or &quot;pixel&quot; of an image and produces electrical signals. The basic &quot;empty black box&quot; is tiny compared with the darkened room, but the principle method of producing an image on a screen remains exactly the same as projecting an image on a wall of a room.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello. I'd be eager to teach to and learn from anyone, be it through internet or live meeting. I've been in martial arts for 9 active years now and I've been researching martial arts in a more advanced manner for a year and half or so.

Though I understand the financial needs of martial art schools, I'm strongly against taking fees from teaching, so I put up this book to share my experience with anyone willing to learn. I'm gaining enough from the teaching itself, though I'd still prefer a more... active teaching, if you will.

Anyways, I have an email and messenger at trigonoroidi@hotmail.com. I'd like anyone to share opinions about this book and point out anything of interest, no holds barred.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The goal of one dimensional motion is to understand how acceleration (&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;), drives changes in speed (&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;) and position (&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) along a single direction of motion (one-dimension). An &quot;object&quot; means anything that can move, like a ball, car, truck, or person. One-dimensional means the object will only move along a straight line, typically along the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis if it's moving left or right or &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-axis if it's moving up or down.  There are two equations you need for this, 

&lt;math&gt;x=x_0+v_0 \Delta t+\frac{1}{2}a \Delta t^2&lt;/math&gt;, 

and the second is 

&lt;math&gt;v=v_0+a \Delta t&lt;/math&gt;.  

If the object is at &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; with speed &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; will be the object's new position and speed at some time interval &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; later. These two equations allow you to compute the new position and speed of an object (&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;), based on its old position and speed (&lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt;), given some acceleration &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; that is acting on the object, over a time interval &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes called the &quot;time step&quot; and is a small interval of time that separates when the object has &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt;, and when it will have &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.   

We said that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; drives changes in &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Notice in these equations if &lt;math&gt;a=0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;v=v_0&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; doesn't change between time steps;  &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is constant if &lt;math&gt;a=0&lt;/math&gt;.  In order for &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; to change, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; must be nonzero. In other words, an object's speed can change only if it has an acceleration.   For the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis (left-right motion), we have that 

&lt;math&gt;x=x_0+v_{0x}\Delta t+\frac{1}{2}a_x\Delta t^2&lt;/math&gt; 

and 

&lt;math&gt;v_x=v_{0x}+a_x \Delta t&lt;/math&gt;.   

For the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-axis (up-down motion), we have that 

&lt;math&gt;y=y_0+v_{0y}\Delta t+\frac{1}{2}a_y\Delta t^2&lt;/math&gt; 

and 

&lt;math&gt;v_y=v_{0y}+a_y \Delta t&lt;/math&gt;. 

These equations are the same, just the notation is different, being very specific as to which axis it pertains.   

== A numerical example ==

As an example, Suppose you have a sphere at &lt;math&gt;x=5&lt;/math&gt; m with speed &lt;math&gt;v=1&lt;/math&gt; m/s and an acceleration of &lt;math&gt;a=0.5&lt;/math&gt; m/s&lt;math&gt;^2&lt;/math&gt;.  When the next frame comes up, say &lt;math&gt;\Delta t=0.1&lt;/math&gt; s later, where will the sphere be and what will its speed be? Use the equations to get that &lt;math&gt;x=5\mathrm{m}+(1\mathrm{m/s})(0.1\mathrm{s})+(0.5)(0.5\mathrm{m/s}^2)(0.1\mathrm{s})^2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x=5.1025&lt;/math&gt; m and &lt;math&gt;v=1\mathrm{m/s}+(0.5\mathrm{m/s}^2)(0.1\mathrm{s})&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;v=1.05&lt;/math&gt; m/s. Be sure you see how the equations allowed you to compute the new position and speed of the object over the time step &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;. You can iteratively use this new &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; as a new &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;x\rightarrow x_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v\rightarrow v_0&lt;/math&gt;) for computing still another &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; another &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; in the future. Can you find &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; after another &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; has gone by?
In the Figure 3.22 find the acceleration of the masses and the tension in the string.

== Signs ==

Be very aware of signs.  Think of a cartesian coordinate system with &lt;math&gt;+x&lt;/math&gt; to the right, &lt;math&gt;-x&lt;/math&gt; to the left, &lt;math&gt;+y&lt;/math&gt; up and &lt;math&gt;-y&lt;/math&gt; down (assume &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; is always positive).  Positive values of position mean the object is to the right (&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) (or up, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;) relative to the origin.  Negative means the object is left (&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) (or down, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;) relative to the origin. Positive values of speed mean the object is moving toward the right (&lt;math&gt;v_x&lt;/math&gt;) or up (&lt;math&gt;v_y&lt;/math&gt;), negative means to the left (&lt;math&gt;v_x&lt;/math&gt;) or down (&lt;math&gt;v_y&lt;/math&gt;).  The sign of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; alone doesn't immediately help to characterize the object's motion.   If, however, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; have the same sign, &lt;math&gt;v=v_0+a \Delta t&lt;/math&gt; will predict an increase in &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; (that is if &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; have the same sign, an object will speed up).  Likewise, an object will slow down if &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; have opposite signs.  

[[File:Sphere_va_opposite.png]]


A case where opposite signs of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; persist means &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; will get smaller and smaller, until eventually &lt;math&gt;v=0&lt;/math&gt; at which case the object will stop. If &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; still persists, then &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; will begin to increase in the same direction as &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;; now the object is speeding up, but in the opposite direction to its original motion. All told the object slowed down, stopped, then started speeding up in the opposite direction.  All combinations of signs between &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; are possible.  &lt;math&gt;v&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; is a slow-down and potential turn-around case, as is &lt;math&gt;v&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;v&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;v&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; are speed up cases, but in opposite directions. Lastly, you should be able to draw arrows on an object, representing its &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and that instant.  The arrow should point in the direction of a given parameter and its length should be proportional to its strength.  For example, if on an object the arrow for &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and the arrow for &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; were opposite, you'd know the object was slowing down.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Purpose of the guide:'''
Fast and comprehensive tips, how to speed up your PC with MS Windows. Its written for normal(non-geek) people, so the geeks don't have to help them do the same thing over and over and over and over again.

'''Why should I read this?:'''
Have you noticed that your PC is working much slower than it used to? I mean MUCH slower? That you have time to make dinner before some programs start? There may be a solution for this problem not involving purchases of a new PC, or spending money on support, or buying programs(possibly buying more RAM memory). Try to read through the whole guide and try to understand it, most of the words/terms that you don't understand can easily be found Googleing or on Wikipedia.

'''Why did I write this?:'''
Well, the reasons are many, but the main one being to help people with the common problem of slow computers. I tried to write this as easy as possible, keeping the text usable for the normal PC user. The text contains my own points of view, mainly to help people on the right track, so please don't delete them.

One more thing before we start, as a normal user you should know that the PC is a very complex electronic device, and you may be required to read other articles to fully understand this guide. If you are using a PC you need to know what a processor(CPU) and hard drive(HDD) is, I am sorry. Having a drivers license you most probably know what the engine does in the car, and what wheels are responsible for, without knowing more complex structures. Its the same in the PC, just the basics.
And remember, this is just a guide, every PC is different, I will just try to give you the tools, and the rest is up to you, and all you do is on your own risk. So please, don't skip Step 1.



== Step 1: Backup!! - Keeping the life vest on ==


Always always have a backup of your valuable data(pictures, documents, videos, music etc.) on a separate medium(CD,DVD,usb drive,external hard drive). If you don't, then do this. And yes, it has to be external, don't just copy it over to another partition, cause if you format the disk or drop it to the floor, you may loose the data anyway. And data recovery is expensive. 

The easiest way to do backup, in my opinion, is to create a separate folder on the desktop, and then copy everything you want to keep over there. So you have everything in one folder. Its easier to check if you didn't miss anything this way. Then copy the folder over to the external medium. Nowadays the usb drives are very cheap and easy to use. Before you go and buy one, check how big the backup folder is. You do this by right clicking on the folder and choosing properties. Then get a usb drive that is 30-40% bigger. 

E.g., if the backup folder is 3500MB(3,5GB), don't buy the 4GB one, cause it may not be enough, go for the 8GB or even better, the 16GB, so you have more space for future. If you have a lot of big files, like movies, consider buying an external hard drive. They are not cheap, but come in handy when your PC crashes. 
In my opinion, the most important data, that you should check, and double check, and triple check(yes very important) is: 
Pictures, documents, passwords and electronic certificates. If lost and data recovery fails, its hard to get them from other sources. Movies/music/games can always be downloaded/bought.

About passwords, write them down on a paper, or make a text file and put it on your backup. Don't keep it on the PC. If you are afraid of someone reading it, consider using  an encryption program, a very good one is [http://www.FreeOTFE.org/ FreeOTFE], or [http://www.truecrypt.org Truecrypt], which are open source and free. Remember to keep your backup up to date! Do regular backups. And if you want to be extra safe keep the backup in a safe outside your house, e.g. in a bank.

'''Summary:''' Backup all your important data to an external medium, e.g. an usb drive. And keep it up to date. Especially pictures, documents, passwords, electronic certificates, music, movies.



== Step 2: Hardware identification - Looking in the dark ==


The first thing to do is to identify what kind of PC you have. A laptop or stationary. If its a laptop, write down the model number, e.g. Lenovo IdeaPad Y530, or Samsung N120 or whatever you have. Usually you can find it somewhere written on the laptop. 

If you have non custom assembled stationary PC, e.g. DELL, HP, ACER, ASUS etc. You will have to find the model number too. If it is a custom assembled, e.g. a friend put it together, or a shop did, then keep reading.

Next you have to write down the specifications of the PC. That is the different PC parts(hardware). This may be tricky if you are a beginner. There are specific programs you can use for this purpose.

&lt;big&gt;'''The PC consists of:'''&lt;/big&gt; 

'''Processor(CPU)''', it is the brain of the PC. The engine. There are two major CPU brands '''INTEL''' and '''AMD'''. To see what kind of CPU you have, go to:

 In Windows XP:
 (start-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;System)

 In Windows Vista/7
 (start-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;System and Maintenance-&gt;System)

 Please see: http://bayimg.com/JADAhAacl

Here we can see that my CPU is a Intel Core 2 6400 2.13GHz
Intel is the company, Core 2 6400 is the model, and the speed(clock frequency). 2.13GHz is 2130MHz.


'''RAM memory(RAM)''', is the fast short term memory. It is used by the CPU to access a lot of data very fast. Usually, data is read from the hard drive to the RAM, then it is used by the CPU. And then, if necessary saved back to the hard drive. The thing is that once you switch off the PC the RAM memory is cleared. So hard drives are used to save data when the power is off.

The problem here is that many programs are not memory efficient and stuff the RAM full. And when the RAM gets full, the PC redirects the RAM traffic to the hard drive. This is the very often slowdown we can see when RAM gets full, because hard drive is MUCH slower then RAM memory. 

So e.g., you switch on the PC, and you have some programs that auto start, they are placed in the RAM. And if they take up the whole RAM space, the PC starts to write the RAM data to the hard drive, and the PC starts to think and think, and this is when it takes 5 min to start e.g. Word.

So a slow PC is not only the result of slow CPU, it is a more complex issue.
RAM space is measured in bytes. 1GB is 1000MB, on the picture above we can see that I have 2GB of RAM.


'''Hard drive(HDD)''', is the “permanent” memory, it is measured in bytes(MB or GB) 1000MB is 1GB. To compare: one “old floppy” is 1,44MB, one CD is usually 650-700MB, one DVD is 4,7GB(dual layer is 8,5GB). 
Usually, the more MB/GB the better. 

HDD is the bottle neck in file transfer, because it is relatively slow. And it is, I would say, the most delicate component. If you drop the laptop, usually the first thing to break is the HDD. The HDD is also a tear and wear component, meaning it needs to be replaced once every couple of years. It depends how much you use the PC, but sometime its 5-10 years, sometime 20 years. 
So for all of you relieving your aggression on your laptops because they act inappropriately(are slow), please stop doing that, it may work on humans, but doesn't work on laptops. What can happen is irreversible damage to the HDD.

One final note about hard drives. Everyone knows that the hard drive &quot;is&quot; C: under Windows. But this is not correct. One hard drive can, but doesn't have to, be divided into smaller parts, called partitions. If you go to(start-&gt;Computer), you should see something like this:

 Please see: http://bayimg.com/IaDapAACl

Here we can see that we have C: and D:, looking at the icons, C: is a hard drives and D: is a DVD. So nothing special. But if you see something like this:

 Please see: http://bayimg.com/jADAfaACL

Here we see C:, D:, F:, Y: and Z:. 
Looking at the icons, C:, Y:, Z: are HDD, D: and F: are DVDs. 

So in this situation, we have 1 HDD with 3 partitions or 2 HDD or 3 HDD. To differentiate, we have to open (start-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;System and Maintenance-&gt;Administrative Tools-&gt;PC Management-&gt;Disk Management).

 Please see: http://bayimg.com/iaDAOaaCl

Here we can see Disk 0, which is the primary hard drive, is divided into 2 parts(partitions), one is C: 48,83GB and the other is Y: 323.78GB.

The second hard drive is not divided and is assigned Z: 931.51 GB. 
The reason why we do like this will be discussed later.


'''Graphic card(GFX/GPU)''', is responsible for generating the picture on the screen. It is like a CPU but specialized only on graphics. There are many different graphic cards, for different purposes, in different price ranges. But there is some kind of artificial boarder we can divide them into.

*''Simple cheap('''low end''')'' ones only used for non graphic demanding applications like surfing the web, MSN/ICQ, email, Office etc. They are often used in cheap laptops.

*''Average performing('''middle end''')'' with a higher price then low end. Used for the same as low end, plus PC games on average graphic settings and other average graphic demanding applications. Most stationary PCs of non-power users have either a “high low end” card or a “middle end” graphic card.

*''High performing('''high end''')'', those cards are insanely expensive and use a lot of electricity. They are only for power users, gamers and other people that know how to use them. One such card can be as expensive as rest of the PC together.

For non gamers and normal users, the graphic card doesn't really matter. What is important to know is the model name of the graphic card, so correct drivers may be installed. There are 3 big players on the graphic market: 

*'''nVidia''' with its '''GeForce'''
*'''ATI/AMD''' with its '''Radeon'''
*'''Intel''' that produces some on board(motherboard) GPUs.


To check the graphic card go to(start-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;System and Maintenance-&gt;System-&gt;Device Manager-&gt;Display Adapters)
This program is very useful, it shows you everything that you have in the PC, and reports if a hardware is not correctly installed/functioning.

 Please see: http://bayimg.com/JadAGAaCL

Here we can see that my graphic card is a nVidia GeForce 7300GS, it is a low end card.


'''Motherboard(Mainboard,MB)''', is a big unit where all the components are attached to. Its like a skeleton in the body, responsible for keeping everything in on place. And provide the proper communication between the other components. The easiest way to check the model name of the motherboard is to download a free program called CPU-Z. This program will also show you the detailed information about your CPU and RAM.

The most important information here is model name and bios version. So we have an Asustek(Asus) P5B-VM with bios version 0901.


'''Summary:''' Use the  Device Manager and CPU-Z to identify your hardware and write them down on a paper. Not on the PC. What you have to know before you proceed is: PC Model, CPU, RAM, HDD, GFX and MB. My system would look like this:

 Custom assembled PC
 Intel Core 2 6400 2.13GHz
 2GB RAM
 400 GB + 1TB(1000GB) HDD (I have 2 hard drives and 3 partitions)
 nVidia GeForce 7300GS
 Asus P5B-VM bios version 0901

This is the basic description of your PC. This is what you tell people when they ask what kind of PC you have. Not like “its a pink one, with a flower on it, it has some connections in the back and it says HP on it.” No, those 6 lines is what you are supposed to say.

== Step 3: Assessment - Live or Die ==

Earlier users had to make a tough decision, either stay with a 8 year old operating system (Windows XP) or switch to the resource hungry Windows Vista making the PC slow. Or they could also try a Linux Distribution, like Ubuntu. I have stopped trying to convince people to it. Mainly because of people's untreatable fear for new things. But I still advise it as an alternative for old PCs. There are a lot of other guides about Linux and Linux vs Windows, Google them if you are interested. So back to the topic. 

Now that Windows 7 has arrived, and it got good reviews. I am recommending it. So either go for Linux or W7.

The official requirements for W7 are 1Ghz CPU, 16GB HDD, 1GB RAM and DX9 GFX. This is not too precise data, there are a lot of PCs out there, that do fulfill this, but would run very slow.

So lets take a closer look on the requirements.

*1GB of RAM. I would recommend 2GB. Just to be safe from RAM to disk slowdowns. Ram is very cheap now, especially the DDR1 and DDR2 type, which is found in majority of “almost new” PCs today. To check what type you have use the CPU-Z program.

*CPU over 1 GHz (this value doesn't say much, but if your PC was bought after 2004, you should be able to run W7. 

*16GB HDD. The system itself uses around 10GB so 16GB is really the minimum. You need some hard drive space, first for the operating system, and then for your programs and other files. So a minimum of around 40 GB would do.


So let say you have a laptop from 2005, with a 1,6Ghz CPU, and 60GB hard drive and 1,5GB RAM. And this is OK. But most laptops from 2005 wont have 1,5 GB RAM, they will have 256MB or 512MB. So what now? Well you have 3 options.

#Don't spend anything and install the operating system that the PC came with(probably Windows XP).
#Don't spend anything and Install a Linux Distribution, see Windows vs Linux
#Buy some RAM and install W7.


To buy RAM may be tricky, there are a lot of different kinds. So what I would recommend is to take the PC to a local(small) specialized PC store, and ask them to install 2 GB of RAM memory. This shouldn't cost more than 150USD(2009) for DDR1 and 60USD(2009) for DDR2. If you have some more cash to spend, go for 4GB(newer PC).

If you choose option 1 or 3, continue reading. If you go for Linux, I should congratulate you being free from Microsofts enslavement, and continue reading your Linux guide of choice.

'''Summary:''' W7 is a great operative system, and I believe it will be the next Windows XP, it is here to stay for many years. 
If you have a PC able to run it then go for it. 
Remember if it doesn't satisfy you, you can always go back to the old operating system. And don't forget to buy some RAM, so you have at least 2GB. Even if you plan to run Windows XP.

== Step 4 Preparing - To format or not to format ==

OK so you have a PC that is slow, and you have read so much boring text about the PCs, and its still slow. So WTF? Yes I know, but we had to cover that boring theory. Now lets get to some practical stuff. Preparation for destruction. There are two schools of managing the slow PC problem. Stay and play or kill 'em all.

*Stay and play: Basically you install more RAM memory, delete the unnecessary programs, run antivirus, and install resource efficient programs. This method is safer, less time consuming(mostly) and less complex. If you choose this, go to (start-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;Programs-&gt;Programs and Features) and start deleting everything you don't need. And what don't you need? Well, I don't know, that's why its better to choose the other option. But if you don't want to wipe everything, jump to step 6.

*Kill 'em all: You make a backup, antivirus scan it and wipe the disk. Then you install a fresh version of Windows with the latest service pack(SP). This method has more risks. 
**The biggest one being that you might delete something you forgot to backup. 
**And the second one is that you may get stuck in the process of installing the operating system, and may have to call for help. But remember, the only damage that you may cause is easily reversible. Formatting the disk and installing new operating system will not cause any permanent damage to the hardware. Just don't forget about the backup.
**And really, its not that difficult to install Windows, just press “next” if you are uncertain.
**On the positive side, this is the best method of optimization, and the only way to be sure to get rid of all the viruses,trojans, ad ware and other nasty stuff that may parasite your PC . And this is the method I recommend strongly. Its not that hard, really. Just follow the guide and you will be fine.

Preparing for a format may be quite boring, but its important to do it correctly. Just follow those steps.

*Do backup! On external medium. Check and double check.
*Prepare the installation CD/DVDs
**If you want to try W7, borrow the DVD from a friend or get it from a torrent site. You don't have to activate it, just install and try and see how well it works on your PC. If you like it, go and buy it. If not, install back your old operating system. 
**If you are installing your old system, write down the activation serial number, its usually on a Microsoft sticker somewhere on the PC.
**Its good to install Windows with the latest service pack. As for today, Windows XP has service pack 3, Vista has service pack 2. And W7 doesn't have one yet. 
**If you want an updated operating system DVD with latest service pack, visit ones again a friend or a torrent site, or other places that you may know. 
**If you use a old DVD without the latest service pack, you will have to install them later anyway, and it is very time consuming. So do try to get an updated version. You can also slipstream a service pack(Windows XP only). Google it if you are interested.
**One important thing here, don't install Windows XP with no service pack or with service pack 1. Those versions don't have a build in firewall. Meaning your computer will be exposed to the internet without and protection. Its like having unprotected sex with an unknown person, stupid stupid idea. A firewall protects you from a virus type called worms, they infect your computer, when you are connected to the internet. And the most important thing, you don't have to do anything, you will not even notice anything. Like a STD. Once you are in(connected), you are fu**ed.
**One more thing, when you are installing Windows from a CD/DVD you got with the computer, or if you are installing it from a recovery program, remember, very often, if not always, you will get a lot of crap programs installed too. This is a way of the PC manufacturers to earn money, so this is another reason to get a clean OEM CD/DVD. 
**To get a clean OEM CD/DVD with the chosen operating system, go ask around your friends, ask the geeks(they will know) or go to a computer store and ask what you have to do to get a clean Windows OEM CD/DVD. 
**Or you can download it, but this option is often a violation of the copyright, but hey if you have illegal copies of movies and music, cause I guess most of you have, so I guess you won't mind. But don't get me wrong, I buy my software, I believe that if a program is good, it should be bought.

*Download drivers
**If you have a laptop or non custom assembled PC, go to the web site of the manufacturer and download the latest drivers for your PC. E.g., if you have a HP, go to hp.com and go to support, and write in your model number there. Then the web site should show you the way. This step is good to do. It may be hard to find the drivers on the website, but try to find them, especially the network drivers, in case a fresh Windows install won't find the proper ones. Windows 7 has a lot of drivers build in, and it found all mine that were important. But just in case, download them.
**If you have a  custom assembled PC, go to the website of the motherboard manufacturer, in my case Asus(Asus.com) and download the drivers from there, especially the network drivers.
**If you find a BIOS update, you can download it too. But remember, updating your bios may damage your hardware, so if you don't know what you are doing, don't update the bios. Or ask someone for help.
**If you don't find any drivers, you can always hope for the best and install Window anyway. And if that fails you can always go back to your old installation(old installation CD or recovery).
**And don't use the drivers you got on a CD with the computer, they are usually old. Download the newest once from the website. And in case you can't find the drivers, and Windows doesn't work without them, then maybe consider using old drivers. Remember, most computer crashes are caused by old/bad drivers.


To help you on the way, a small explanation about torrents. To use bit torrent technology, you first need a program do download stuff with, called a bit torrent client. A good one is [http://www.utorrent.com uTorrent]. Don't use the Azureus/Vuze, its slow and resource hungry. 
Download uTorrent and install it. Its for free and a virus free program.
Now you need a place to download torrent files from, a torrent file is a small file containing instructions for the bit torrent client how and where from to download the files you want to get. A place like this is called a tracker. A good one is [http://www.thepiratebay.org The Pirate Bay].
So for example, you want to download Ubuntu, or any other operating system. Ubuntu is open source and fully legal to download. First install uTorrent. Then visit thepiratebay.org, mark the “application” box and “search titles only” box and search for Ubuntu. 
Here we see the results. On the top of the page, we can see 7 columns. 

*'''Type:''' It is the category of the file, for Ubuntu its “Applications &gt; UNIX”. Yes Linux is an UNIX like system.

*'''Name:''' Its the name of the file with a short description.

*'''Uploaded:''' the date when the torrent file was uploaded.

*Next column is nameless, its a fast link to download the file.

*'''Size:''' Size of the file.

*'''SE:''' Seeders, its the estimated amount of people that have the complete file.

*'''LE:''' Leechers, its the estimated amount of people that is downloading the file.

Now to download the Ubuntu file, we want to download it from the best source, with the highest number of Seeders, if a file has 0 or 1 seeders, it may be very difficult to download it, especially if the file is big.

So we click on the SE to sort the result my the number of Seeders. 

And now we click on the file we want to download. And click “download this torrent”. Download it to the desktop, it will be easy to find it then.

Now double click on the torrent file you downloaded, to open it in uTorrent. The program will ask you where you want to save the big Ubuntu file, just put it on the desktop too, its easier that way.

And now we have to wait until the file finishes. It may take some time, but read further so you know what has to be done.

Most files that you download, that contain an operating system, are stored in an .iso file, e.g. Ubuntu.iso. 
An iso file is like a .zip file. It acts like a container for other files. So what you should get once the download is finished, is ONE big file. Called something.iso. If its many .rar files, you need to unpack them with [http://www.7-zip.org 7zip]. But lets assume its one big .iso file.

Now once download is finished, we have to copy(burn) this .iso file to a DVD (or CD if the file is small enough). To do this we need to use a CD/DVD recording program. A good and free one is [http://www.imgburn.com Imgburn], NERO is good too, but its big, slow and expensive. 

To be able to record CD/DVDs you need a blank CD/DVD  and a CD/DVD burner. Nowadays everyone has one, and if you don't, copy the file over to an usb drive and visit your friend. Imgburn will tell you if it can find a CD/DVD burner.

So, to burn the CD/DVD, just download Imgburn, install, click write Image file to disk. Choose the file we downloaded, and click on the icon on the bottom left corner, the one with a disk with an arrow to the CD. And the program will start recording. When the program is done, we have a fresh CD/DVD with the operating system of our choice.


'''Summary:''' OK, so we have done the backup, we checked its compete. And we checked it again. We have a clean OEM CD/DVD with Windows on it, and we checked its with the latest service pack(SP3 for XP, SP2 for Vista). And we have all the drivers from the website on an usb drive. OK, next step.

== Step 5: Installing Windows - Total Annihilation ==

Before you wake up your blood thirsty destructive side, check that you have done your backup, I know I am repeating myself on this topic, but formatting the disk till erase all data on the drive. Check that you have a serial key for Windows, and check that you have the newest drivers for Windows.

Before we can install a new operation system, we need to check one option in the BIOS. We need to check that CD/DVD is booting(starting) before the HDD. It may sound complicated, but its really easy. To enter BIOS, we need to restart the PC
The first couple of seconds when the PC is booting you may see a message like “To enter BIOS press F2”. You have to press that key before Windows starts. It is usually the F1, F2, F12 or the DEL key. If unsure, press all of them when the computer is starting. 

In the BIOS you move around in the menus using the arrow keys. Don't worry, if you don't save any settings you won't break anything, if unsure, press the power button and start all over again. In the BIOS you need to find something that is called Boot Order or Boot device priority. Look around in the menus. If you find it, make sure that the CD/DVD is listed before the HDD. Don't forget to save the settings. If unsure read the manual, if you don't have one, download one from the manufacturers website.

Here is an old but good YouTube clip about BIOS: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc1t3c5Yke8

Because there are millions of guides about installing Windows. I am not going to reinvent the wheel again, so here are some good ones. Just follow them. 

Just one more thing, the partitions, you will have to choose if you want to install Windows on the whole disk, or to split the disk into partitions. The easiest is to install Windows on one disk with one partition. And if you don't want to complicate things, do that.

But if you e.g. create 2 partitions, e.g. C: and Z:, you can install Windows on C: and then use Z: for all your files. And then when you will have to install/format the disk again, you can only format C: and leave Z: alone. This will save you a lot of time. The choice is yours.

If you choose to do 2 or more partitions, just remember to do the C: at least 20-30GB big, I would recommend 40GB (40 000 MB).

One final note from me, there are 2 versions of each of the operating system, a 32 bit version, called x86 and a 64 bit version called x64. The 64 bit version is only for computers with 4 GB RAM or more. Don't install 64 bit system on 2 GB, its a waste of memory. 
I know, I have it. But it was purely experimental.

'''Windows 7:'''
*Those guides are for an earlier testing version of Windows 7, so it may look a little bit different, but the installation process should be the same. The installation process of Vista is similar to W7 so just follow them.
*A good guide with pictures: http://www.techtalkz.com/windows-7/514412-windows-7-installation-guide-tutorial.html
*Microsofts Official W7 RC installation guide: http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/get/installation-instructions.aspx

'''Windows XP:'''
*Microsofts official guide: http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/setup/winxp/install.mspx

If you have any problems or questions, Google them, most of them are answered somewhere. Or use a tech forum to ask, or ask friends.

'''Summary:''' Install the operating system of chose.

== Step 6: Configuration - The beginning ==

So we are done installing Windows, we can see the desktop, so we are done? No, this is just the beginning. This is where the fun part starts.

The first thing we should do is to see if we have an internet connection. Just start a browser, e.g. Internet Explorer(IE). If it does work, we are lucky. If it doesn't work, well, complications.

To start diagnosing the internet connection problem, we need to look closer how you connect to the internet. There are three main ways to connect to internet.

#If you have a router home and you connect to the internet using either the wireless connection or the Ethernet(wire) connection. Then the problem probably involves the drivers.
#If you use an usb modem(xDSL) you need to install the drivers for it, and then log on using the user name and password. If you don't remember the password, look through the internet papers home, it should be somewhere there. Together with the CD for the modem.
#You use an old modem to connect to internet. First thing, consider getting normal broadband, 56k modems are out of fashion. Next thing, find your internet papers and follow the instructions there. It involves entering a phone number, a user name and password.

Option 2 and 3 involves finding the papers, if you don't have them, call support, its usually free of charge, but you will probably be placed in a phone cue.

If it is option 1, then you have to install the network drivers, the ones you downloaded, if you don't have them, you will be stranded. Call a friend. This problem often appears in fresh installations of Windows XP. But has been solved in majority in W7. So one again, W7 is good for you.


So let assume the internet works. The next thing you should do, before anything else is to start Windows Update, and update your Windows. It can be found here: (Start-&gt;Windows Update).
If you are using XP, go here: http://update.microsoft.com

This is important in two ways:
#Some drivers may be installed through MS Update
#Some security flaws may be fixed, so you are more resistant to some viruses(worms). Always keep your Windows installation up to date. 

After the update, check if you have the latest service pack, go to(start-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;System and Security-&gt;System) there you will find, name of the operating system, and the service pack installed. See the picture above in Step 2.

If your Windows doesn't have the latest service pack, please install it, just keep updating your PC with Microsoft Update, and it will update it. Be patient , it may take a while.

Next is to check with drivers are missing. Go to (start-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;System and Maintenance-&gt;System-&gt;Device Manager). There you will have a list, the drivers that are missing will have an exclamation mark .

Like this: 
http://www.geckoandfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/find_search_download_windows_xp_missing_drivers_free_software_vista_how.jpg

Here we have a typical situation in XP where the drivers for graphic card, motherboard and network/modem are missing.

http://img160.imageshack.us/i/37862200yz2.jpg/#q=missing%20drivers

Here we are missing drivers for a sound card. 

I guess you get the idea.
If you don't know what drivers are missing, try the different components in the PC. E.g. if the internet works, probably the network card is working. Test both the wireless and wire network card. If they both work, its OK. If the sound works, well then the sound chip is OK. And so on. Try everything.

'''Remember:''' Don't install old drivers from the CD you get with the hardware. Go to the website of the manufacturer and download new once. Don't be lazy, it will make your system more stable. As an example, have you ever written something on the computer, for couple of hours, and when you where done you pressed print and the damn PC crashed? And you didn't save? Well, happened to me too. There are four things you can learn from this.

* Update your Windows regularly
* Update your programs regularly
* Use only new drivers
* Save before printing 

The most important drivers install/update are:

*Motherboard: Check the manufacturers web page and download the newest ones. Its important. I have seen computers crashing in very odd ways with bad motherboard drivers. Of what I know W7 installs most motherboard drivers through MS Update.

*Network card: Important too, if the internet is working try MS Update, if it fails check the PC/motherboards manufacturers web page.

*Sound: the same as Network card.

*Bluetooth: the same as Network card

*Webcam: the same as Network card

*Graphic card: this one is special. If Windows do find your GFX, its still recommended to update the drivers. Mainly because you can gain more performance. Its a little bit trickier to update the GFX. Remember, I wrote that there are 3 player on GFX market, nVidia, ATI/AMD and Intel. If you have an Intel card, don't update, its enough with the Windows Update.
**Nvidia: If you have a nVidia GeForce GFX, go to http://www.nvidia.com and download and update your graphics card.
**ATI/AMD: If you have an ATI Radeon, go to http://www.ati.com and download and update your graphics card.
**Remember: if you are a gamer, and play new games, keep an eye out for new drivers. Often updating GFX drivers will increase the performance in the games. Sometime even dramatically. Don't be lazy, update GFX drivers often. They are released once every 1-2 months.
**If you have a laptop, it may be impossible to install the official drivers. What you can do is to modify them with a program, that will enable you to update the drivers.
***For laptop users with a nVidia card: http://www.driverheaven.net/nvmodtool.php
***For laptop users with an ATI card: http://www.driverheaven.net/modtool.php
***Just read the instructions, its not too hard. 

One more thing here, if you divided your hard drive into 2 or more partitions, you have to format the other ones to be able to see them. Go to: (start-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;System and Maintenance-&gt;Administrative Tools-&gt;PC Management-&gt;Disk Management).
Here right click on the unallocated partition of the disk, and select new simple volume. Follow the instructions.

'''Summary:''' After the install, update Windows with MS Update, install all the missing drivers. And don't forget about GFX drivers.

== Step 7: Programs - Ini Mini Maini Mo ==

OK, so its been a long road, and I hope most of you will come to this point cause its very crucial in this guide.

A program is an application, that performs a certain task, most of you know that. What most of you don't know is that there are a lot...a LOT of programs that can perform the same tasks. In a better or worse way, but the same.

There are two camps here:
*Either using big, resource hungry, slow and often expensive programs. Like Nero, MS Office, Photoshop, MSN, Norton Anti virus(most anti virus programs).
*Using less expensive, often free software, that is smaller, faster and sometimes more secure.

A lot of people don't know this, but there is actually at least one free, legally free, alternative program for every commercial program.

One thing I should say here, is that the big and expensive programs often have more features and functions. But you should know, that most people(99.9%) won't ever use those extra functions anyway. So its up to you what you want to use.


Here in this table, I will list all my favorite programs, with the links, short description, and its commercial alternatives. I have chosen these programs mainly because I use them myself and I think they are the best ones. All of them are free of charge and fully legal to download.

One important thing, because all of those programs are free(open source or freeware), some of them may want to install some ads on the PC. Making it slower, and possibly more insecure. So during the install, choose the custom install, and unmark any box saying, install Google toolbar, or ask toolbar. Don't install these useless programs. Just an advise.

One more thing, remember, a lot of PC settings can be changed from the control panel, look around there, and customize your PC in your own way.

'''Summary:''' Install the programs you need. Avoid the big, resource hungry programs, they will slow down the computer.

== Step 8: Windows optimization - Removing the crap ==

This step involve increasing the performance of your PC. There are a lot of program suits claiming to improve the general performance in a magical way. Don't be fooled, most of them don't work.

The first thing we should do, is to: 

*Remove all programs we don't use from the PC. If you just formatted your PC, you don't have to do this. 
*Install all the programs you are going to use. Don't forget to unmark the ads during the installation process. Follow step 7.
*Now, start CCleaner. CCleaner is a small and a very good program used to get rid of stuff like temporary files and auto start programs. 
**In the program select Cleaner tab, press “analyze” and then “Run Cleaner”. Now all the temporary files are cleared.
**Next select the Registry tab, then “scan for issues” and then “fix selected issues”. Press no to “you want a backup of those files”, and then “fix all selected issues”.
**Next select tools and startup. Here you will have a list of everything that is auto starting, meaning starting when you start your PC. Some of it is important, some is not. That's why you should disable the stuff you are uncertain of and not delete. Google the .exe file to see what they do. But generally, disabling the anti virus program, drivers for e.g. Sound card and GFX is not to recommend.
**The reason for disabling programs to auto start is to save RAM memory. And in this way both speed up the startup of the computer, and avoid getting RAM full. 

To see how much RAM your PC is using, press Alt+Ctrl+Del buttons simultaneously, and then “start Windows task manager”.
Then select the performance tab. Here you can see how much ram is used, and how much CPU is used. 

Usually, if you don't do anything with the PC, and you don't have any programs running, The CPU activity should be round 0-5%. If its fluctuating up to 60-90% then you have something running on your PC that shouldn't be running, like viruses or ad ware. Solution? Step 5.

In the processes tab, you can see which program uses the most RAM memory and CPU.

Another way of disabling a program to auto start is to open up the program in question, go to its setting menu, and unmark the box saying start on system startup. This can be done in majority of programs, e.g. MSN and Skype.

The best way to see which programs auto start, is to reboot the PC and then check the Windows task manager. You can also see which programs opened up in the lower right corner in Windows.

There is one more important thing I would like to cover. It is the Windows graphical performance properties. Sound scary, but what it means is that you can choose either:

* Having a nice looking Windows installation, with nice animations and transparencies(Vista and W7), but the trade off is slower performance
* Disable all or some of this eye candy and increase system performance.

The decision is yours to make. You can access those setting here: (start-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;System and Maintenance-&gt;System-&gt;Advanced System Settings-&gt;Settings for performance)

Here you can choose specific options, or just go for all or nothing.

The last thing I want to share is: When you download something, whether its programs, or BIOS or firmware or anything. ALWAYS get it from official sources. This way, you reduce the chance installing viruses and damaging your hardware.

'''Summary:''' Remove all the unnecessary programs, install everything you need, run CCleaner, remove as much as possible from the auto start. And then adjust your Windows graphical performance properties.

== Step 9: For the pros - Gambling your life away ==

If you want to be more professional, there are some other things you can do. But remember, all of them can damage your hardware, permanently, no format will help.

*Updating your bios: can increase your overall performance, stability, and compatibility. Its best to do the bios update before installing a new operative system. Look for the new bios updates on the motherboard/your pc manufacturer web page.

*Updating graphic card firmware: you can download the newest firmware(like bios for GFX) to increase the GFX performance, usually this involves setting a higher memory clock speed on the GFX. Download this from your GFX manufacturer web page.

*Updating CD/DVD: updating the firmware in the optical drive may increase the burning speed as well as medium compatibility, get it from your manufacturers web page.

*Overclocking: by increasing the Front Side Bus(FSB) you increase the CPU clock, with increases the CPU performance. You can also overclock you RAM memory and your GFX. There are a lot of guides how to do this. Use Google.

Chapter 4:  Gender Bias in the Classroom

	While there are many issues regarding equal education that occur within the classroom, gender bias tends to be overlooked in many instances. Many teachers would not want to admit that they are gender biased; the gender bias tends to be unintentional. Furthermore, “Gender bias is difficult to detect because it affects girls and boys in different ways.”  (Sadker &amp; Zittleman, 2005) There are many factors that lead to gender bias in the classroom including biased texbooks and software. Other issues are “the socialization of gender, and a permissive attitude towards sexual harassment.” (Chapman) Educators need to find ways in which they can overcome this issue.  They need to develop strategies in which they can create a conducive learning environment for all students regardless of gender.

One of the main reasons for the  concern of gender bias in the classroom is the achievement gap between boys and girls. “Many people are not convinced that gender equity is an issue in the 1990s.”  (Mewborn, 1999) Since then, attitudes have been changed due to reasearch. Recent research suggests that “Girls receive higher report card grades throughout their schooling career. Boys outscore girls on most high-stakes tests, including both the verbal and math sections of the SATs” (Sadker &amp; Zittleman, 2005) “It is also the case that males outscore females on standardized tests for entrance to graduate school, law school and medical school.” (Mewborn, 1999) Given this evidence on gender performance shows the possibilities that gender bias exists. According to  Verkuyten &amp; Thijs, gender difference has been found in sex-based favoritism, whereby girls tend to be more gender biased than boys while there are several studies in which it appears that boys tend to be more biased in the ethnic domain than girls. (Verkuyten &amp; Thijs, 2001)  In another study, researchers “noted four types of teacher responses to students: teacher praises, providing positive feedback for a response; teacher remediates, encouraging a student to correct or expand their answer; teacher criticizes, explicitly stating that the answer is incorrect; teacher accepts, acknowledging that a student has responded. They also found that boys were far more likely to receive praise or remediation from a teacher than were girls. The girls were most likely to receive an acknowledgement response from their teacher.” (Chapman)

	One way to combat gender bias in the classroom is to be aware of the curriculum. For example computer software, “there are several sources of gender bias in the use of computers by young children. These sources include bias that exists in the media and in societal role models, differential computer technology resources available for boys versus girls, and biased attitudes of teachers and parents regarding computer use.” (McNair, Kirova-Petrova, &amp; Bhargava, 2001) Other curriculim to be aware of is textbooks, videos, and periodicals. Teachers need to ask themselves does it “omit contributions of women, that tokenize the experiences of women, or that stereotype gender roles”? (Chapman) According to Mewborn, the curriculim should be replaced because “using biased materials reinforces the idea that women are not valued contributors to a particular field of study”. (Mewborn, 1999)  She did mention that “it may be necessary to use biased materials, either because a particular text is mandated by your school or because the content of the material is particularly good In those cases, explain to students that you recognize the materials are biased, and explain why you are using them” (Mewborn, 1999)

	Teachers  also needs to recognize behaviors that are socially gender limiting. They  need to remember that “Every time students are seated or lined up by gender, teachers are affirming that girls and boys should be treated differently. When an administrator ignores an act of sexual harassment, he or she is allowing the degradation of girls. When different behaviors are tolerated for boys than for girls because 'boys will be boys', schools are perpetuating the oppression of females. “(Chapman) Since there is “some controversy surrounds the role of teachers in counteracting gender stereotypes. Some feel that gender stereotypes are a product of the early rearing practices in the home environment and that schools should remain neutral, thus allowing students to develop their own gender identities.” (Frawley, 2005) 

Teachers also need to come up with strategies to involve all students equally so as to ensure that all children are partiticipating regardless of gender. A good example is to “distribute a certain number of chips or slips of paper to students at the beginning of a class period. Students must turn in a chip when they wish to speak, and the goal is to use all of the chips by the end of the class period.” (Mewborn, 1999) The teacher also needs to make sure that all of the students receive equal instruction and that the “The purpose is not to marginalize boys in order to elevate girls.” (Mewborn, 1999) According to Mewborn teacher also should perticipate in trainings and activities to help them become more aware of issues regarding gender bias and develope strategies to improve the classroom environment.


	A more controversal study has encorporated gender segregration.  As a result of “The No Child Left Behind Act includes a problematic proposal to change Title IX, the federal law prohibiting.sex discrimination in education, by encouraging the establishment of public single-sex schools and classes for girls and boys” (Sadker &amp; Zittleman, 2005) While there are a few studies that have been performed in regards to gender segregation “these inconsistent findings arise mainly from analytical decisions on how best to control for variance associated with group differences. For example three separate researchers using data from the same database.” (Shapka &amp; Keating, Winter 2003) Without more research, it is nearly impossible to conclude that gender segregation is effective.  It also goes back to the issue of sexual discrimination.  “Some view this approach as part of an anti-male movement, bolstering girls' achievement at the expense of boys and making schools more equitable by eliminating masculine stereotypes, and &quot;feminizing&quot; boys” (Frawley, 2005)“In reality, gender bias is very much an issue for boys and girls, an issue too many educators fail to see. For example, can you imagine a teacher organizing a spelling bee by matching black students against white students? Certainly not in today's society. But consider the same teacher organizing the same activity by gender, boys against girls. That's a practice so common that it has become an acceptable, unquestioned part of school life. But why? We have yet to come across a single study showing that gender segregation and competition serve any positive educational, social, or psychological purpose. Still, we see some schools separating girls and boys in lunchrooms, class lines, playgrounds, and school buses.” (Sadker &amp; Zittleman, 2005)
It is quite scary to think that as far as our country has come there are times when it still reverts back to stepping on individuals civil rights no matter how unintentional it is. 


Educators and “administrators, have a responsibility to help establish a school climate in which all teachers, staff, students, parents and community members know that equity is a high priority.” (Mewborn, 1999) There is an immense call for education reform to ensure that all genders receive an equal and quality education. As educators teachers need to pay close attention to themselves and be more aware of their own bias’ so that they will make every student that walks within those school doors succeed to the best of their abilities.

Chapter 4: Gender Bias

Gender bias in education is the unequal treatment of one sex over another in an education environment. Gender bias in school, between teachers and students is still prevalent. Most of us, as students, have experienced gender bias, whether in a physical education or in a science class. The majority of gender bias occurs unintentionally, whereas some occurs intentionally. Gender bias is a social issue that society is constantly confronted with. Some instances gender bias is school board limitations, which have improved. The most influential type of gender bias is a female or male is “taught” or counseled. For instance, influence on what classes to take which can influence his/her preference on what class to choose in the future. Gender bias has caused many developing issues in society for both genders, whether it is career choices, technology use, or even achievement gaps. Disparities can be caused by teacher behavior, peer influence, or parents. However, the focus of this paper is on teachers in education.

Career choices, for either gender, have improved over the years. A major influence of female careers has been the women’s rights movement. Women’s rights were first questioned during the eighteenth century, the Enlightment Period, mainly in France and Britain (Wikipedia). However, women’s rights are a continuing struggle in modern society. The career paths available to women to choose from are directed by guidelines of modern society; women’s rights have not fully developed, which influences the careers that women can choose from. For example, women are still thought of as the people who should be teachers in an education field. Why? Is the limited career choice still due to the education females receive or the bias that occurs in the classrooms, whether from a male or female teacher?

At times, the socialization of gender within our schools assures that girls are made aware that they are unequal to boys. Every time students are seated or lined up by gender, teachers are affirming that girls and boys should be treated differently (Chapman, 1995).  The American Association of University Women published a report that revealed females received less attention from teachers and the attention that was receive was often more negative than the attention received by the males (Bailey, 1992). Even with this negative attention bias, females performed better in writing and reading assessments compared to males, and almost matched males in the science and math (O’Neill, 2000).

The achievement gaps between males and females could be due to gender bias in present education. Experts think that the gender bias given by teachers negatively affects the self-esteem levels of females. With the self-esteem levels fluctuating, in comparison with males, females tend to care less about academic skills and avoid math and science or precision courses (Woodward, 1998). Even though studies have shown that females have lower self-esteem levels they still have better overall academic success compared to males. For example, females stay in school longer, cut classes less than boys, and on average earn better grades than males (Woodward, 1998). As mentioned before, males currently performed better in math and science, but females have greater achievement in reading and writing. In contrary to these results in academics, the career path for females has expanded. For example, females have increased nearly by fifty percent in the medical fields (Woodward, 1998).

Teacher behavior is influential as to whether gender bias occurs, even though the majority of it is unintentional. Teachers’ biases send transparent messages that are harmful because the messages are influential as children developed their beliefs. A child’s perception of gender roles are infected by gender bias given by influential people in their lives. The “hidden curriculum”, created by gender bias, is subtle lessons that children encounter every day through teachers’ behaviors, feedback, classroom segregation, and instructional materials (Frawley, 2005). This could be a result from the way a male or female teacher teaches. In a Clemson University study, of high school teachers, female physics teachers were underrated, view as less effective, whereas the chemistry and biology ones where not underrated by the female students. Additionally, the study concluded that “few differences in teaching style exist between male and female teachers which had no correlation with the gender-bias ratings” (Polowczuk, 2009). Even though the results of female teachers were underrated overall, but the way to overcome a low teacher rating would be change the way the material is presented to the class, without gender bias.  Teacher bias is hard to recognize as a teacher, but it could be monitored then improved. For example, a teacher could be monitor with video unaware and then they watch it at the end of the day and improve in the areas where they are promoting gender bias.

Gender bias in society is still prevalent, but there are ways to improve and change gender bias. Earlier, it was shown how gender bias influences our societies, in careers, achievement gaps, or even as teachers. This is a subject that needs to be changed in our education system, but with any issue gender bias needs to be dealt with at an area where they perceive and receive the most influence. Gender bias is a difficult issue to realize in society because it is unintentional, majority of the time. This could remain as a social issue because gender bias is hard to overcome. To surmount gender bias it needs to be dealt with at the root of the problem, in the youth stages when cognitive thinking begins to develop.

      <comment>Set stable version settings for &quot;Wikijunior:How Things Work/Jet Water Pump&quot; [Default: Stable, Precedence: Pristine]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A pump-jet or water jet is a method of propelling boats and water-borne craft through water. Most boats and ships are pushed through the water using a traditional rotating propeller or&quot;screw&quot;. This works well, except in shallow water or places where water-weed grows. 

When a &quot;naked&quot; propeller touches anything other than water it is likely to become &quot;fouled&quot; (bent or obstructed) and may stop working. Propellers are also dangerous when working near large creatures such as whales, sharks and human divers, who may be injured by the sharp rotating blades. Water jets can often be rotated to steer the vessel, so that it does not need a rudder. This is called &quot;Vectored thrust&quot;

To avoid these problems a New Zealand inventor called Sir William Hamilton tried first to simply enclose the traditional screw propeller in a protective frame or cage, but after some experiments discovered that either a ducted propeller with nozzle, or else a centrifugal pump and nozzle worked better. The first functioning pump-jet propelled boat was launched in 1954.

Here are some pictures to illustrate the difference between a conventional (naked) maritime screw propeller and the pumped water jet fitted to a torpedo.

The word '''Electricity''' comes from a Latin word meaning &quot;''like amber''&quot;. Amber is the fossilized sap from ancient trees often used in jewellery.
''Electricity'' is the ''flow of charge in a conductor''. A ''conductor'' is anything that can carry electricity (like a metal wire). ''Charge'' is the amount of electricity an object contains.




==Who invented it?==
Electricity was discovered in 1600, by an English physician called William Gilbert. He made a careful study of electricity and magnetism. He differentiated between the lodestone effect (lodestones are natural magnetic stones) and the static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He was the first to use the word &quot;''electricity''&quot; in its modern sense. 

==How does it get power?==
Electricity is a type of energy. It supplies power to different objects to help them work. For example: &lt;br&gt; Electricity supplies energy to a computer and helps it work.
[[File:Rutherford_atom.svg|thumb|left|Rutherford's model of an atom]]

==How does it work?==
Everything in the world is made up of ''atoms''. An atom is made up of a nucleus (the large ball in the middle). The nucleus is made up of ''protons'' and ''neutrons''.  ''Protons'' have a positive charge while ''Neutrons'' have no charge at all. The small balls spinning around the nucleus are called &quot;electrons&quot; and have a negative charge. In an atom the positive and negative charge are exactly the same and so no electricity flows. 

Due to this when the amber is rubbed, the outer electrons are ''removed'' and this makes the charge of the atom positive (because there are now more protons than electrons). This positive charge attracts anything with a negative charge (or other electrons that are part of different atoms). 

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
==How dangerous is it?==
Electricity in small quantities is not dangerous. But if the amount of electricity is ''big'' then it is very dangerous as it will give a very bad electric shock.

==What does it do?==
Electricity supplies energy which helps many objects work.

==How does it vary?==
Electricity does not vary.

==How has it changed the world?==
Due to electricity many people can move around quickly in electric cars. Computers, TVs, Toaster, and many more were created after electricity was discovered.



==What idea(s) and/or inventions had to be developed before it could be created?==
''Atoms'' had to be discovered before the discovery of electricity.

==Facts==
* If you rub amber with silk, you may experience a tingling sensation (also called static electricity), and small things tend to 'stick' to the amber. This was probably ancient people's first experience with electricity.It is this attraction that makes the small bits of paper or cloth &quot;stick&quot; to the amber.

* A primitive form of  electrical machine was constructed around 1663 by Otto von Guericke, using a sulphur globe that could be rotated and rubbed by hand, so detaching electrons mechanically. The easiest and most reliable way to detach electrons from their nucleus is to break them off using chemicals. or magnetism. We call these devices &quot;cells&quot; (or more usually in English &quot;batteries&quot;) and generators.
[[Image:Ohms law voltage source.svg|thumb|200px|left|A basic electric circuit.]]

* In 1791, Luigi Galvani hung some frogs' legs on a wire frame, and noticed that every time he did so, they twitched. He concluded that electricity was stimulating the nerve cells.

* Alessandro Volta found that cells connected together increased the power available, and he called that a voltaic pile or battery. This provided the early electrical scientists and engineers with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. 

* Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827.

* The first magnetic magneto or dynamo was built by Hippolyte Pixii in 1832, but, except for small units for bicycles they are no longer used for power generation due to the size and complexity of the rotating connections on the &quot;commutator&quot; between the fixed and rotating coils.

* Michael Faraday developed the &quot;rotating rectangle&quot;,in which each active conductor passed successively through regions where the magnetic field was in opposite directions. The first public demonstration of a more robust &quot;alternator system&quot; took place in 1886, and this has remained the most common arrangement used in power-stations.

* The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian Ørsted and André-Marie Ampère some time between 1819-1820.

* All these people are honored by having electrical units or devices named after them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Pedagogy of state ==
Hello 193.175.53.21,

first of all, thanks a lot for your ongoing contributions! I like the new structure and conciseness of [[Haskell/Understanding Monads]] a lot.

Concerning state and the state monad, there is a particular issue: for a lot of things that involve local state, you don't need the state monad at all. For instance, the parenthesis counting function can be implemented as follows:

    count inParenthesis []       = 0
    count inParenthesis ('(':cs) = count True  cs
    count inParenthesis (')':cs) = count False cs
    count inParenthesis ( c :cs) =
        (if inParenthesis then 0.5 else 1 ) + count inParenthesis cs

The local state is represented as an accumulating parameter, the pattern &lt;code&gt;s -&gt; (a,s)&lt;/code&gt; doesn't show up.

Generally, the state monad only makes sense when the state should be implicit, i.e. when you don't want to mention it in the code. So, it should be some kind of global state that would give rise to a lot of needless plumbing when tracked explicitly. Random numbers are an excellent example for this kind of state. (However, they are borderline to being a new monad.)

:(I finally decided to get an account; I usually avoid that because it allows me to edit controversial pages, after which I tangle myself up in flamewars).
:Agreed that the present example is not really great, it's just converting a string to an integer. Also it does not provide for the case in which one extracts values of different types.
:However I am not sure that random numbers are the best option either. They require people to understand how they work (&quot;random numbers are too important to be left to chance&quot;) and how they are implemented in Haskell, so I was looking for something more trivial and came up with a stripped-down parser.
:Do you have any idea of what would be a simple use of the &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; monad, requiring little &quot;schooling&quot; (like the section &quot;Random Number Generation&quot;)? Or do you think we can cut that section down to a newbie-friendly size? --[[User:Orzetto|Orzetto]] ([[User talk:Orzetto|talk]]) 07:16, 4 September 2009 (UTC)

:: Yeah, the schooling required for random numbers is quite a drawback. We do have to explain them at some point - they're a recurring topic on the mailing list - but I agree that they're not quite satisfying as introductory example.
:: Concerning examples, let's see how others do it:
::*[http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/marktoberdorf/baastad.pdf Wadler] introduces the state monad with the task of counting the number of reductions in an interpreter. Interpreters make excellent monad examples - monads ''are'' interpreters in a sense - but they might be perceived as impractical. Or rather, unlike nested &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; (Maybe) or random numbers (State), beginners are unlikely to have written interpreters.
::* [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/marktoberdorf/ Simon Peyton Jones] discusses IO in terms of &lt;code&gt;World -&gt; (a,World)&lt;/code&gt; and, most importantly, shows pictures.
::* Real World Haskell [http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/monads.html#id638674] and [http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/monads.html#monads.state] uses a stripped down deterministic parser as example, followed by random numbers. The parser requires schooling.
::* [http://www.haskell.org/all_about_monads/html/statemonad.html All about Monads] uses random numbers as example, but forgoes the schooling.
::* [http://spbhug.folding-maps.org/wiki/MonadsEn Eugene Kirpichov] does the same.
::* [http://ertes.de/articles/monads.html#section-6 Ertugrul Söylemez] idem.
::* [http://blog.sigfpe.com/2006/08/you-could-have-invented-monads-and.html Dan Piponi] idem.
::
:: Overall, looks like the existing options are
::* Going for interpreters, which would have the big advantage of presenting monads in the framework they belong to, at the expense of not being able to connect with what the reader might already know.
::* Random numbers; we have to explain them anyway. In the current text, we can definitely cut down the detailed genesis of (&gt;&gt;=) since that was explained by [[Haskell/Understanding Monads]]. The rest can take a cutting, too.
::* Simple parsing. I think it should be possible to come up with a neat example here, but that requires thought. Maybe something along the lines of
::: &lt;code&gt; takeList = evalState . mapM (State . splitAt) &lt;/code&gt; [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/55539/focus=55554]
:: -- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 09:28, 4 September 2009 (UTC)

:: Found a criterion for judging examples: the example must contain a function &lt;code&gt;foo :: S -&gt; (A,S)&lt;/code&gt; for some A,S that is reused multiple times.
::* Wadler: &lt;code&gt;foo = eval&lt;/code&gt;; reuse inside &lt;code&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt;
::* Random numbers: &lt;code&gt;foo = rollDie&lt;/code&gt;; reuse for &lt;code&gt;sumTwoDice&lt;/code&gt;
::* Simple parsing: &lt;code&gt;foo = splitAt&lt;/code&gt;; reuse in &lt;code&gt;takeList&lt;/code&gt;
:: -- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 09:42, 4 September 2009 (UTC)

:::Hm, if so many use random numbers there may be a good reason (either they copied each other, or it is really the best example). I'll see if I manage to trim down the schooling section a bit. --[[User:Orzetto|Orzetto]] ([[User talk:Orzetto|talk]]) 17:49, 5 September 2009 (UTC)

:Found another example that might be suitable, namely the famous turtle from [[w:Logo (programming language)]]. In other words, a state machine that supports commands like

    forward 100
    left 90
    right 90
    pen up
    pen down
    x &lt;- senseObstruction

:Paul Hudak did this in his book [http://www.haskell.org/soe/ The Haskell School of Expression] with the &quot;Imperative Robot Language&quot;.
:The advantage is of course that the state monad is used to write an interpreter while the drawback is that we have no graphics to show with. (That being said, I always wanted to write some kind of graphics library for use with the wikibook.)

== Syntax highlighting bug ==
There is a syntax highlighting bug (see [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=52509 bug report]) which means that single quotes are treated as if they delimit strings.  Perhaps the examples should be modified to avoid using single quotes until the bug is fixed.

==Questions==
Hello there,
Is there a place where I can get a little help on this specific chapter? Is there a forum concerning this book or something? I'm having some trouble understanding all this monad stuff and couldn't find any details on the examples of this text.
Thank you very much for writing all this, by the way. All the content from beginning through here was very clear and helpful.

:While not specific to the wikibook, your questions are very welcome on [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Irc IRC (#haskell)], mailing list [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Mailing_Lists beginners@haskell.org] and [http://stackoverflow.com/tags/haskell/info StackOverflow].

== newtype pattern matching ==

Hello, I noticed what might be an error in following passage:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|
The Haskell typeclass State is defined as a function that consumes state, and produces a result and the state after the result has been extracted. The definition is wrapped inside a newtype to avoid pattern matching, so that no one can explicitly pattern-match and extract state unless we allow it.
|}

It says that definition is wrapped inside a newtype to avoid pattern matching, but afaik pattern matching on newtype is possible. Also, is State a typeclass?

I am still novice, so this may be wrong, it would be nice if someone experienced could check this.

: I guess that by &quot;if we allow it&quot; the author meant &quot;if we export the constructor&quot;, from a module that we write on our own. For &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;StateT&lt;/code&gt; (which we will in all likelihood not have to define on our own) that is of course the case. I agree the text can be made clearer. As for the by now fixed typeclass issue, it was a mistake - there is a &lt;code&gt;MonadState&lt;/code&gt; class, but it has not entered the discussion at this point. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 04:25, 11 May 2012 (UTC)
: (By the way, another reason for having &lt;code&gt;newtype&lt;/code&gt; here is that it is a good idea to use it when there is just a single constructor, for efficiency reasons. I will add a note about it in some chapter - it is just a question of deciding the best place.) --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 04:28, 11 May 2012 (UTC)

== The Problem with Haskell and State ==

This section probably had a good intention, but it's thoroughly wooly. First off, it fails to explain &quot;The Problem&quot;. Then it says various vague things that may be seen to be somehow related to the advertised topic, if you already know what this section is probably supposed to say.  

And there's this: &quot; Procedural languages like C use variables outside the current scope to keep track of state.&quot;What? How can variables outside the current scope be ''used'' for anything?

And &quot;Starting from an initial state (commonly called the seed), they produce a sequence of numbers that have the appearance of being random.&quot;  The &quot;they&quot; doesn't refer to anything. It's probably intended to refer to a random number _generator_, in which case the state referred to in a later sentence is a state of that generator object, and not necessarily global per se.  [[User:Gwideman|Gwideman]] ([[User talk:Gwideman|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Gwideman|contribs]]) 10:45, 21 February 2013 (UTC)

:Fair criticism. I rephrased the introduction slightly and removed the &quot;Problem&quot; header. Re: &quot;outside the current scope&quot;, I guess it the intended meaning was &quot;declared outside the current scope&quot;, so I changed it to that. As for the final point, I believe it is OK, as local mutable state is no less non-standard in Haskell as mutable globals (&quot;non-standard&quot;, of course, only in the sense you need IORefs and the like to pull it off).

:By the way, possibly the Right Thing to do here would be merging this opening section with the dice examples later on, as they run parallel to each other. [[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 23:50, 17 August 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In regards to question 17 on the quiz: &lt;math&gt;A \propto Z^2&lt;/math&gt; is incorrect; &lt;math&gt;A \propto Z&lt;/math&gt; is more correct and the best option available for your quiz.  When you say something x is &quot;directly  proportional&quot; to y (&lt;math&gt;x \propto y&lt;/math&gt;) you mean &lt;math&gt;x = k y&lt;/math&gt; for some unknown constant k.  Or if you measure (x1 = 10, y1= 20) and you know they are linearly proportional, you can find out that if x2 = 20 that y2=40  (and if proportional to the square it would be y2=80).

Let's look at some randomly chosen stable forms:

Z = 1; A = 1

Z = 2; A = 4

Z = 3; A = 7

Z = 4; A = 9

Z = 5; A = 11

Z = 10; A = 20

Z = 20; A = 40

Z = 30; A = 64

Z = 40; A = 90

Z = 50; A = 120


The trend we see is that &lt;math&gt;A \propto Z&lt;/math&gt; fits much better than &lt;math&gt;A \propto Z^2&lt;/math&gt;.  

Take any two elements (besides H and He) say B (Z=5) where A(B)=11; and try using the a proportionality to Z and Z^2 to guess the A for Sn(Z=50).  &lt;math&gt;A \propto Z&lt;/math&gt;, would guess that since Z increased by a factor of 10, that A should increase by a factor of 10, to A(Sn) = 110.  &lt;math&gt; A \propto Z^2&lt;/math&gt; would guess that since Z increased by a factor of 10, A should increase by a factor of 100, and guess A(Sn)= 1100.  The linear proportionality is much closer to the data than the squared proportionality, though there are better models then this.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:BBC Broadcasting House 532073098.jpg|thumb|right|BBC Broadcasting House in London had a tall antenna on the top to radiate its signal]]
Radio is a Latin word meaning &quot;around&quot;. All around us there are electromagnetic vibrations. When we see things, we are converting light-waves to brain-signals. Light waves are also electromagnetic vibrations, with violet coloured light being the shortest vibration and red light being the slowest vibration we can see. We call the rainbow effect a visible spectrum. Below this is the infra-red spectrum and eventually the radio spectrum. The other electromagnetic radiations, with frequencies above the ''radio-frequency'' range, are ''microwave, infra-red, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays''.
'''''To understand the rest of this article you may need to see the page about [[Wikijunior:How Things Work/Electricity|electricity]].'''''

[[File:CrystalRadio.jpg|thumbnail|right| a crystal radio]]
==Parts of the radio.==
A radio receiver first needs an antenna or aerial to detect these electromagnetic waves and turn them into electrical signals. An antenna is usually a rod of metal or a metallic 'ferrite' rod surrounded by coils of wire. Next is a radio frequency (RF) amplifier and usually a low radio-frequency stage called and intermediate amplifier (IF) so that the audio signals can be more easily detected or discriminated from the &quot;carrier&quot; radio-frequency which is discarded. Next comes the audio frequency (AF) and finally the electrical signal is made into sound by a loudspeaker (LS) or &quot;transducer&quot; 

==Who invented it?==
Many people were responsible for creating the radio. Some of them are The names of Guglielmo Marconi, Nikola Tesla, Alexander Popov, Sir Oliver Lodge, Reginald Fessenden, Heinrich Hertz, Amos Dolbear, Mahlon Loomis, Nathan Stubblefield and James Clerk Maxwell.

==How does it get power?==
Portable radios get power from batteries. The bigger radios which are not portable are connected to the wall socket.

==How does it work?==
Radio waves are just another form of radiation that are created when a charged electron vibrates with a frequency that lies in the radio frequency (RF) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. In radio, this acceleration is caused by an alternating current in an antenna. 

Radio frequencies occupy the range from a few tens of hertz (cycles per second) to three hundred gigahertz (That is three hundred thousand million (3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Hz).  Commercial radio for entertainment and television use only a small part of the radio spectrum. Different channels use different frequencies and  therefore do not usually interfere with each other. 

====About frequencies.====
Each frequency has a wavelength, so that high frequencies have short-wavelengths, which is why you will hear expressions such as &quot;short-wave amateur band&quot; for &quot;ham radio&quot; or VHF (Very high frequency) for local radio. Long waves tend to travel long distances so in Britain &quot;the long-wave light program&quot; was an entertainment channel broadcasting electromagnetic waves 1500 meters long or 200 thousand cycles per second (200kHz) which was easy to receive anywhere in the British isles. (The service has now been replaced by local VHF transmitters)

The energy of an individual photon of visible or radio frequency is too low to remove an electron from an atom, so radio waves are classified as non-ionizing radiation. X rays, along with nuclear beta, delta and gamma rays can damage living cells in our bodies.

==How dangerous is it?==
The high-powered radio is harmful (can burn us). But fortunately the power of a radio transmitter gets weaker with distance. Hence a high-powered radio is not dangerous at a distance.

==What does it do?==
A Radio sends sound waves though the air and those waves are caught by the receiver.
[[File:Radio_DAB_.JPG|thumb|right|a typical radio with an external antenna]]

==How does it vary?==
Radios can be divided into two types.
* Radio designed for you to listen to someone.
* Radio designed for you to listen and to talk to someone.

==How has it changed the world?==
The radio changed the way people communicated all over the globe. What usually took months to communicate from one part of the world to another part of the world could be done in a few minutes.

==What idea(s) and/or inventions had to be developed before it could be created?==
Before a radio could be created, power and antennas had to be developed. 

==Facts==
* A commercial transmitter may produce thousands of watts of power, but a receiver not far away will only be able to detect a few millionths of a watt.
* The speed of light and radio waves is 299,792,458 m/s (about 186,282 miles per second). A bit less than 300 million meters per second.

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;

==Purpose==
This template is intended to unify all &quot;transliteration&quot; templates (like &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{IAST}}, {{ISOtranslit}}, {{ArabDIN}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. These templates are still  usable, but they  just transclude this one (e.g. &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{IAST|saṃskṛtam}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a shortcut for &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{transl|sa|IAST|saṃskṛtam}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;), and &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ArabDIN|...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{transl|ar|DIN|...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

The transliteration is marked as belonging in the &quot;latinx&quot; class of [[MediaWiki:Common.css]] (note, this renders obsolete the &quot;IAST&quot; class formerly used by &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{IAST}})&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

==Usage==
There are two ways of using this template: with or without specifying the transliteration scheme used:
*two parameters, with [[w:ISO 639|ISO 639]] language code: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{transl|ar|al-Khwarizmi}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; means that &quot;al-Khwarizmi&quot; is a transliteration from the Arabic in a loose or unspecified scheme.
*two parameters, with [[w:ISO 15924|ISO 15924]] script code: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{transl|Ogam|MAQI}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; means that &quot;MAQI&quot; transliterates an [[w:Ogham|Ogham]] inscription without specifying the language. Potentially useful when writing systems themselves are under discussion, e.g.  &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{transl|Cyrl|š}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{transl|cu|š}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{transl|ru|š}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; when discussing the letter Ш.

*three parameters, with [[w:ISO 639|ISO 639]] language code: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{transl|ar|DIN|al-Ḫuwārizmī}} / {{transl|ar|ALA|al-Khwārizmī}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; the second parameter specifies the scheme used (DIN vs. ALA). 
*three parameters, with [[w:ISO 15924|ISO 15924]] script code: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{transl|Arab|DIN|Ḫ}} vs {{transl|Arab|ALA|Kh}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; for ﺥ.

===Examples===
*{{transl|ar|[[w:al-Khwarizmi|al-Khwarizmi]]}} / [[w:DIN 31635|DIN 31635]]: {{transl|ar|DIN|al-Ḫuwārizmī}} / [[w:ISO 233|ISO 233]]: {{transl|ar|ISO|al-H̱uwārizmī}}  / [[w:ALA-LC Romanization|ALA]]: {{transl|ar|ALA|al-Khwārizmī}}
* [[w:Royal Thai General System of Transcription|RTGS]]: {{transl|th|phasa thai}} / [[w:ISO 11940|ISO 11940]]: {{transl|th|ISO|p̣hās̄ʹāthịy}}

'''ISO''':
*Russian/русский &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{transl|ru|ISO|russkij}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;:  {{transl|ru|ISO|russkij}}
*Abkhaz/Аҧсуа &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{transl|ab|ISO|aṗsua}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;: {{transl|ab|ISO|aṗsua}}
*Arabic/عربي &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{transl|ar|ISO|ʿarabī}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;:  {{transl|ar|ISO|ʿarabī}}
*Tamil/தமிழ் &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{transl|ta|ISO|tamiḻ}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;: {{transl|ta|ISO|tamiḻ}}
*Bengali/বাংলা &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{transl|bn|ISO|baṅla}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;: {{transl|bn|ISO|baṅla}}

== How many people follow {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==

There are about 250–500 million followers. It is the fourth largest religion in the world.

== Where is {{SUBPAGENAME}} practiced? ==
Buddhism is practiced mainly in Asia. The Asian countries where it is practiced include Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Burma, China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam, Tibet, Bhutan, and Mongolia. There are many people from all over the world that practice Buddhism.

== What are the main beliefs of {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==
In Buddhism there is the belief of reincarnation. Reincarnation means that after you die you are reborn again into a different form of life. Reincarnation happens because a person or living creature cannot escape the cycle of unhappiness. Buddhism preaches that unhappiness is something that happens over and over again. The way to end unhappiness and reincarnation is through understanding what Buddhists call &quot;The Four Noble Truths&quot;. 

What are the The Four Noble Truths? The Four Noble Truths are teachings by the Buddha. The first Noble Truth is called the &quot;Truth of Suffering&quot;. The second Noble Truth is called the &quot;Arising of Suffering&quot;. The third Noble Truth is the &quot;Cessation of Suffering&quot; and the last Noble truth is the &quot;The Path out of Suffering&quot;.

Buddhists also believe in karma. Karma is an action that a person takes which causes an effect. This means that what you do has an effect on things. Karma changes the past, present and future. Buddhists believe that practicing good actions can put a person on the path towards ending reincarnation and becoming &quot;enlightened&quot;. Enlightenment happens when a person changes their path or cycle of reincarnation.

The last Noble Truth (The Path out of Suffering) teaches the Eightfold Path. The Eightfold Path is a teaching by the Buddha about how to end reincarnation and reach Nirvana. What is Nirvana? Nirvana is when a person has freed themselves from the cycle of reincarnation and unhappiness/suffering. To reach Nirvana is almost always the goal of many Buddhists. 

A buddha is a person who has reached Nirvana. 

== What texts does {{SUBPAGENAME}} hold sacred? ==
The Dhammapada is a collection of written verses by the Buddha. The Dhammapada tells a person how to practice Buddhist beliefs.

== What are some main holidays and practices of {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==
'''Vesak''' happens on the first full moon day in May or June and celebrates Buddha's birthday.

== What is the history of {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==
The beginning of Buddhism begins with an Indian prince named Siddhartha Gauthama who was born in the year 623 BCE in the country of Nepal. When Siddhartha was 29 years old, he left his palace to find Nirvana or the &quot;Complete cease of rebirth/reincarntion&quot;. At age 35 he attained Nirvana and was known from then on as &quot;Lord Buddha&quot;. He preached what he found for 45 years and died in 483, aged 80 in Kusinara (now Kushinagar) in India. Even though he is known as &quot;Buddha&quot; there have been buddhas before he was born and possibly after he was born.

== Who are some famous people who have practiced {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==
The 14th Dalai Lama (religious name: Tenzin Gyatso) is a follower of Buddhism. He follows a branch of Buddhism called Tibetan Buddhism. He is a spiritual leader for many people and is believed by some to be a reincarnation of a Bodhisattva (a person who has the compassion of buddhas).

== What is a story from {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==
When Siddhartha Gauthama left his palace he saw things he had never seen before. The prince had spent his whole life inside the palace and didn't know what life was like outside of the palace. When he left he saw three things which made him want to end suffering. He saw a sick man, a dead body and an ascetic. An ascetic is a person who practices spirituality and seeks spiritual freedom. When Siddhartha saw the sick man and the dead body he realized that people could not escape sickness and death. Seeing the ascetic inspired him to find spiritual freedom and live a life dedicated towards finding spiritual truths.

== Intro ==

LaTeX has specific features for teachers. We present the '''exam''' class&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-math.mit.edu/~psh/exam/examdoc.pdf examdoc] Using the exam document class&lt;/ref&gt; which is useful for designing exams and exercises with solutions. Interested people could also have a look at the '''probsoln''' package&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/probsoln/probsoln.pdf Probsoln] creating problem sheets optionally
with solutions&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''mathexm''' document class&lt;ref&gt;http://mat140.bham.ac.uk/~richard/programming/tex/exams/msexdoc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

== The exam class ==

We present the '''exam''' class. 
The exam class is well suited to design exams with solutions. You just have to specify in the preamble if you want the solutions to be printed or not. You can also count the number of points. 

=== Preamble ===

In the preamble you can specify the following lines : 
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\documentclass[a4paper,11pt]{exam}
\printanswers % If you want to print answers
% \noprintanswers % If you don't want to print answers
\addpoints % if you want to count the points
% \noaddpoints % if you don't want to count the points
% Specifies the way question are displayed:
\qformat{\textbf{Question\thequestion}\quad(\thepoints)\hfill}
\usepackage{color} % defines a new color
\definecolor{SolutionColor}{rgb}{0.8,0.9,1} % light blue
\shadedsolutions % defines the style of the solution environment
% \framedsolutions % defines the style of the solution environment
% Defines the title of the solution environment:
\renewcommand{\solutiontitle}{\noindent\textbf{Solution:}\par\noindent}
}}

You can replace the 3 first lines with the following : 
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\documentclass[a4paper,11pt,answers,addpoints]{exam}
}}

=== Document ===

* The exam is included in the '''questions''' environment.
* The command '''\question''' introduces a new question. 
* The number of points is specified in squared brackets.
* The solution is given in the '''solution''' environment. It appears only if '''\printanswers''' or '''answers''' as an option of the '''\documentclass''' are specified in the preamble.

Here is an example : 

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{questions} % Begins the questions environment
\question[2] What is the solution? % Introduces a new question which is worth 2 points
\begin{solution} 
Here is the solution 
\end{solution}
\question[5] What is your opinion?
\begin{solution}
This is my opinion
\end{solution}
\end{questions}
&lt;/source&gt;

It is also possible to add stuff only if answers are printed using the '''\ifprintanswers''' command. 

&lt;source lang = &quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\ifprintanswers
Only if answers are printed
\else
Only if answers are not printed
\fi
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Introduction ===

The macro '''\numquestions''' gives the total number of questions. 
The macro '''\numpoints''' gives the total number of points.

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{minipage}{.8\textwidth}
This exam includes \numquestions\ questions. The total number of points is \numpoints.
\end{minipage}
&lt;/source&gt;

The backslash after '''\numquestion''' prevents the macro from gobbling the following whitespace as it normally would.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Note:''' This article requires basic knowledge of PL/I which can be found in [[Software Engineers Handbook/Language Dictionary/PLI]].

=== Declaring Arrays ===

Simple arrays may be declared with the the following syntax:

 DCL   ''name_of_array''   (               ''higher_bound'' )   ''type_of_elements'';
       or
 DCL   ''name_of_array''   ( ''lower_bound'' : ''higher_bound'' )   ''type_of_elements'';

If lower bound is omitted it will get the default value 1.

 example: proc options ( main );
 dcl   array_A (  5)   char (03);   /* array_A has 5 elements with index 1 to 5 */
 dcl   array_B (0:5)   char (03);   /* array_B has 6 elements with index 0 to 5 */
    array_A ( 1 ) = 4711;           /* fill first element of array_A ...                  */
    array_B ( 0 ) = array_A ( 1 );  /* ... and copy its value to first element of array_B */
 end example;
 
Multi-dimension array are declared by separating the dimensions with commas.

 example: proc options ( main );
 dcl   matrix ( 2 , 6:7 )   bin fixed (31);
 /* defines a 2-dimensional array of 4 elements: matrix ( 1 , 6 ) , matrix ( 1 , 7 ) , */
 /*                                              matrix ( 2 , 6 ) , matrix ( 2 , 7 )   */
    matrix ( 1 , 6 ) = 123;   /* store number into first matrix element */
    matrix ( 2 , 7 ) = 456;   /* store number into  last matrix element */
 end example;

Elements of an array may not only be simple types like numbers, strings or pointers but also entry variables, files, structures ...

 example: proc options ( main );
 dcl   1 month ( 12 ),   /* means January ... December */
         2 income   dec fixed ( 7 , 2 ),
         2 outgo    dec fixed ( 7 , 2 );
    month ( 1 ) . income = 1234.56;   /* store income-value of January  */
    month . income ( 2 ) = 2345.67;   /* store income-value of February */
    month ( 3 ) . outgo  = 3456.78;   /* store  outgo-value of March    */
    month . outgo ( 4 )  = 4567.89;   /* store  outgo-value of April    */
 end example;
&amp;nbsp;
 example: proc options ( main );
 dcl   1 year ( 1999 : 2019 ),
         2 month ( 12 ),
           3 value ( 3 , 3 )   bin fixed (15);
 /* all of the following statements are equal */
    year ( 2009 ) . month ( 9 ) . value ( 1 , 2 ) = 32767;
    year . month ( 2009 , 9 ) . value ( 1 , 2 )   = 32767;
    year . month . value ( 2009 , 9 , 1 , 2 )     = 32767;
    year . month ( 2009 , 9 , 1 , 2 ) . value     = 32767;
    year ( 2009 , 9 , 1 , 2 ) . month . value     = 32767;
 end example;

=== Initialising an Array ===

An array may be initialised by the use of the INITIAL (abbr: INIT) attribute.&lt;br&gt;
Initialisation has to be done for every array element individually.&lt;br&gt;
To specify a single element to be uninitialised an asterisk may be used.

In the examples below program ''left'' will be equivalent to program ''right''.

 left: proc options ( main );                    right: proc options ( main );
 dcl   A ( 4 )   char (03)                       dcl   A ( 4 )   char (03);
                 init ( 'ABC' , * , 'XYZ' );
                                                    A ( 1 ) = 'ABC';
                                                    A ( 3 ) = 'XYZ';
 end left;                                       end right;

For making it more comfortable to initialise a huge array an iteration-factor (prefix &quot;''(n)''&quot; meaning: use following value(s) n-times ) may be used.

 left: proc options ( main );                           right: proc options ( main );
 dcl   A ( 2 , 3 )   bin fixed (15)                     dcl   A ( 2 , 3 )   bin fixed (15);
                     init ( (2)5 , (2)* , (2)6 );
                                                           A ( 1 , 1 ) = 5;
                                                           A ( 1 , 2 ) = 5;
                                                        /* A ( 1 , 3 ) will be left uninitialised */
                                                        /* A ( 3 , 1 ) will be left uninitialised */
                                                           A ( 3 , 2 ) = 6;
                                                           A ( 3 , 3 ) = 6;
 end left;                                              end right;
 &amp;nbsp;
 left: proc options ( main );                           right: proc options ( main );
 dcl   A ( 2 , 3 )   bin fixed (15)                     dcl   A ( 2 , 3 )   bin fixed (15);
                     init ( (2)(-3,7) , 99 );
                                                           A ( 1 , 1 ) = -3;
                                                           A ( 1 , 2 ) =  7;
                                                           A ( 1 , 3 ) = -3;
                                                           A ( 3 , 1 ) =  7;
                                                           A ( 3 , 2 ) = 99;
 end left;                                              end right;

Be aware: PL/I also offers iteration factors for strings, e.g. the expression &quot;''(4)X''&quot; is equivalent to &quot;''XXXX''&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
So if an array ''of strings'' is initialised it must be clear whether an iteration factor is for the string or for the initialisation.

 init ( (2) (3)   'X'   )   ... means   use twice:     'XXX'
 init (     (6)   'X'   )   ... means   use once-only: 'XXXXXX'
 init (     (6) '''(''' 'X' ''')''' )   ... means   use 6 times:   'X'

=== Evaluation of Array Expressions ===

* An array expression may contain both arrays and single values
* All arrays in the expression must have the same structure, i.e. they must have the same number of dimensions, and corresponding dimensions must have identical bounds
* The result of the expression has the same structure as the contained array(s)
* The result of the expression may be assigned to an array variable having the same structure

In the examples below program ''left'' will be equivalent to program ''right''.

 left: proc options ( main );            right: proc options ( main );
 dcl   A (2,6:7)   bin fixed (15);       dcl   A (2,6:7)   bin fixed (15);
 dcl   B (2,6:7)   bin fixed (15);       dcl   B (2,6:7)   bin fixed (15);
 dcl   C (2,6:7)   bin fixed (15);       dcl   B (2,6:7)   bin fixed (15);
    /* fill variable B */                   /* fill variable B */
    /* fill variable C */                   /* fill variable C */
    A = B + C * 5;                          A ( 1 , 6 ) = B ( 1 , 6 ) + C ( 1 , 6 ) * 5;
                                            A ( 1 , 7 ) = B ( 1 , 7 ) + C ( 1 , 7 ) * 5;
                                            A ( 2 , 6 ) = B ( 2 , 6 ) + C ( 2 , 6 ) * 5;
                                            A ( 2 , 7 ) = B ( 2 , 7 ) + C ( 2 , 7 ) * 5;
 end left;                               end right;

All operations performed on arrays are done in an element-by-element-way, in right-to-left-dimension order.

 left: proc options ( main );                 right: proc options ( main );
 dcl   A (2,2)   init ( 1, 2, 10, 50 );       dcl   A (2,2)   init ( 1, 2, 10, 50 );
    A = A + A ( 2 , 1 );                         A ( 1 , 1 ) = A ( 1 , 1 ) +  A ( 2 , 1 );   /* =  1 + 10 = 11 */ 
                                                 A ( 1 , 2 ) = A ( 1 , 2 ) +  A ( 2 , 1 );   /* =  2 + 10 = 11 */ 
                                                 '''A ( 2 , 1 )''' = A ( 2 , 1 ) +  A ( 2 , 1 );   /* = 10 + 10 = '''20''' */ 
                                                 A ( 2 , 2 ) = A ( 2 , 2 ) +  '''A ( 2 , 1 )''';   /* = 50 + '''20''' = 70 */ 
 end left;                                    end right;

=== Cross Sections of Arrays Using Asterisks ===

Using asterisk notation a cross section of an array may be referred.&lt;br&gt;
The asterisk specifies that the entire extent for this dimension will be used.

 If an array is declared as
    dcl   A ( 2 , 3 )   char (06);
 the reference ''A ( * , 3 )'' refers to a 1-dimensional array containing the elements
    A ( 1 , 3 ) and A ( 2 , 3 ),
 the reference ''A ( 1 , * )'' refers to a 1-dimensional array containing the elements
    A ( 1 , 1 ) and A ( 1 , 2 ) and A ( 1 , 3 ).

In the examples below program ''left'' will be equivalent to program ''right''.

 left: proc options ( main );            right: proc options ( main );
 dcl   A ( 2 , 2 )   char (10);          dcl   A ( 2 , 2 )   char (10);
 dcl   B ( 2 , 2 )   char (10);          dcl   B ( 2 , 2 )   char (10);
    A ( * , * ) = 'hello PL/I';             A = 'hello PL/I';   /* fill '''all''' elements of A */
    B ( * , 1 ) = A ( 2 , * );              B ( 1 , 1 ) = A ( 2 , 1 );
                                            B ( 2 , 1 ) = A ( 2 , 2 );
 end left;                               end right;

=== Re-Defining an Existing Array ===

A ''new'' declared array may be mapped to an existing ''&quot;old&quot;'' array by using the DEFINED (abbr: DEF) attribute.

In the examples below program ''left'' will be equivalent to program ''right''.

 left: proc options ( main );            right: proc options ( main );
 dcl   A ( 8 , 8 )   char (10);          dcl   A ( 8 , 8 )   char (10);
                                         dcl   B ( 6 , 6 )   char (10)   '''defined''' A;
                                         dcl   C ( 4 )       char (10)   '''def''' A ( * , 2 );
    A ( 6 , 6 ) = 'hello PL/I';             B ( 6 , 6 ) = 'hello PL/I';
    A ( 4 , 2 ) = 'hello PL/I';             C ( 4 )     = 'hello PL/I';
 end left;                               end right;

To refer to designated elements of the old array the declaration of the new array may contain '''iSUB''' elements.

'''i'''SUB means:&lt;br&gt;
Whenever an access to the new array will be done the '''i'''-th index of this refer will be used to calculate the index(es) of the old array.

In the examples below program ''left'' will be equivalent to program ''right''.

 left: proc options ( main );            right: proc options ( main );
 dcl   A ( 8 , 8 )   char (10);          dcl   A          ( 8 , 8 )   char (10);
                                         dcl   transposed ( 8 , 8 )   char (10)   DEF A ( '''2sub''' , '''1sub''' );
                                         dcl   centered   ( 4 , 4 )   char (10)   DEF A ( '''1sub + 2''' , '''2sub + 2''' );
                                         dcl   diagonal   ( 8 )       char (10)   DEF A ( '''1sub''' , '''1sub''' );
    A ( 2 , 5 ) = 'hello PL/I';             transposed ( 5 , 2 ) = 'hello PL/I';   /* swap indexes     */
    A ( 3 , 6 ) = 'hello PL/I';             centered   ( 1 , 4 ) = 'hello PL/I';   /* increase indexes */
    A ( 7 , 7 ) = 'hello PL/I';             diagonal   ( 7 )     = 'hello PL/I';   /* use index twice  */
 end left;                               end right;

=== Connected and Unconnected Storage ===

Arrays will be stored '''connected''' in an element-by-element-way, in right-to-left-dimension order.

 dcl   A ( 2 , 2 , 2 )   char (10);
 allocates adjacent storage in the following order:
    +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
    | A (1,1,1) | A (1,1,2) | A (1,2,1) | A (1,2,2) | A (2,1,1) | A (2,1,2) | A (2,2,1) | A (2,2,2) |
    +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+

References to a ''cross section of an array'' may refer to unconnected storage.

 '''dcl A ( 2 , 2 )'''   will allocates storage in the following order:
    +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
    | A ( 1 , 1 ) | A ( 1 , 2 ) | A ( 2 , 1 ) | A ( 2 , 2 ) |
    +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
 &amp;nbsp;
 the reference   '''A ( 1 , * )'''   refers to connected storage.
    +-------------+-------------+
    | A ( 1 , 1 ) | A ( 1 , 2 ) |
    +-------------+-------------+
 &amp;nbsp;
 the reference   '''A ( * , 1 )'''   refers to '''unconnected''' storage.
    +-------------+ - - - - - - +-------------+
    | A ( 1 , 1 ) |     '''gap'''     | A ( 2 , 1 ) |
    +-------------+ - - - - - - +-------------+

References to a ''structured element inside an array'' will refer to unconnected storage.

 '''dcl 1 A ( 2 ),
          2 B ... ,
          2 C ... ;   will allocates storage in the following order:
    +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
    | A ( 1 ) . B | A ( 1 ) . C | A ( 2 ) . B | A ( 2 ) . C |
    +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
 &amp;nbsp;
 the reference   '''A . B'''   refers to '''unconnected''' storage.
    +-------------+ - - - - - - +-------------+
    | A ( 1 ) . B |     '''gap'''     | A ( 2 ) . B |
    +-------------+ - - - - - - +-------------+

References to ''defined'' array may refer to unconnected storage.

 '''dcl A ( 2 , 2 )'''   will allocates storage in the following order:
    +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
    | A ( 1 , 1 ) | A ( 1 , 2 ) | A ( 2 , 1 ) | A ( 2 , 2 ) |
    +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
 &amp;nbsp;
 '''dcl B ( 2 ) def A ( 1sub , 1sub )'''   refers to '''unconnected''' storage.
    +-------------+ - - - - - - + - - - - - - +-------------+
    | B ( 1 )     |                           | B ( 2 )     |
    | refers to   |            '''gap'''            | refers to   |
    | A ( 1 , 1 ) |                           | A ( 2 , 2 ) |
    +-------------+ - - - - - - + - - - - - - +-------------+

=== Builtin Array Functions ===

'''Common functions:'''
* LBOUND ( A , i ) returns the lower bound of the i-th dimension of array A
* HBOUND ( A , i ) returns the higher bound of the i-th dimension of array A
* DIM ( A , i ) returns the extent of the i-th dimension of array A, i.e. DIM ( A , i ) = HBOUND ( A , i ) - LBOUND ( A , i ) + 1
The array A must not be an array of structures.

 example: proc options ( main );
 dcl   matrix ( 15 , -4:4 );
    put skip list ( LBOUND ( matrix , 1 ) );   /* output:  1 */
    put skip list ( HBOUND ( matrix , 1 ) );   /* output: 15 */
    put skip list (    DIM ( matrix , 1 ) );   /* output: 15 */
    put skip list ( LBOUND ( matrix , 2 ) );   /* output: -4 */
    put skip list ( HBOUND ( matrix , 2 ) );   /* output:  4 */
    put skip list (    DIM ( matrix , 2 ) );   /* output:  9 */
 end example;

'''Mathematical functions:'''
* SUM ( A ) returns the sum of all the elements in array A
* PROD ( A ) returns the product of all the elements in array A
&lt;!-- POLY !!!!!!!!!!!! --&gt;

 example: proc options ( main );
 dcl   A ( 4 )   bin fixed (31)   init ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 );
    put skip list (  SUM ( A ) );   /* output: 10 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 */
    put skip list ( PROD ( A ) );   /* output: 24 = 1 &amp;times; 2 &amp;times; 3 &amp;times; 4 */
 end example;

'''Logical functions:'''&lt;br&gt;
The builtin functions ANY and ALL requires an array of bit strings as argument.&lt;br&gt;
They will be explained in [[Software_Engineers_Handbook/Language_Dictionary/PLI/bit_strings]].

=== Restrictions ===

In  PL/I for MVS arrays are restricted to the following limits:
* The maximum number of dimensions is 15
* The minimum lower bound is - 2,147,483,648 = - 2&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;
* The maximum higher bound is + 2,147,483,647 = + 2&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; - 1
* The maximum memory size is 2,147,483,648 bytes = 2&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; bytes

== D ==
*DSP - Digital Signal Processor - processor designed to efficiently process discrete signal data (e.g. audio, video). Key processor instruction on a DSP is the MAC instruction (multiply and accumulate) which allows a single piece of data to be multiplied by a single coefficient value and added to the value currently in the processors accumulator, all in a single processing cycle.
*DSC - Digital Signal Controller - acronym used by Microchip Technology to define their dsPIC family of products which contain a microprocessing core and a DSP. The alternative definition is used to highlight the products embedded control properties (fixed latency times for jumps into interrupt routines, fixed instruction processing time) regardless of which instruction the processor is currently processing, which is typically not the case for pure DSP architectures.

== W ==
*Workaround - typically a software solution to a hardware problem in a controller product. Usually involves reordering code to avoid a hardware problem, or changing a setting under certain situations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__TOC__

==Introduction==
The hallmark of keyword test design is extensive reuse of keywords to build libraries of focused test cases to test the full scope of functionality for a software package. In the special case of automated testing, more powerful, effective and efficient frameworks extensively reuse the keyword implementation code and other code at lower levels.

Keyword driven testing is a higher abstraction and typically an automation of tests designed, implemented and executed for validation of software functionality. Often the tests are first conceived, documented and run as a series of steps in manual test cases and then transformed to automation for regression testing but the very long history of this approach does not itself preclude a change to using keyword test cases for either manual or automated testing of the first releases. In a context of planned automation testing, the inefficiency of transformation from manual tests generated in one format to automated test cases in another framework can be obviated by just starting with keyword test cases. The keyword test cases can either be driven manually as planned, manually as planned before future automation implementation or manually as necessitated when automation simply has not been completed for whatever reason.

The keyword test case approach includes three major activity divisions and three roles could separately take responsibility for each based on resource skills and strengths but separation of labor is not mandatory. Keyword test case design requires Application Under Test (AUT) domain expertise and strength in test methodology. Keyword implementation may require technical strength and programming skill in the detail of the AUT interface. The skill level required will depend on the complication / atypical implementation of the AUT. And keyword test execution requires understanding of test aggregation, analysis and problem reporting, resolution and liaison.

==Keyword Test Case Design==

===Organization of AUT Functionality and Related Tests===
Success of the test design process and subsequent maintenance is at least in part dependent on organization of AUT functionality to be tested and the tests themselves. A common solution is a tree structure with nodes, here called partitions, that divide the features of the application into logical areas of focus or scope, that represents the testable features at the lowest levels of the tree, and that hold the test cases at that level. Each partition is named, described and may be prioritized.

===Test Case Design===
a test case is designed as a sequence of keywords including the keyword arguments to validate specific AUT functionality. The Test Designer adds keyword argument values within the test case to drive specific action. Once implemented and executed, a Keyword Test Case will navigate and input values to the AUT to create conditions of the AUT functionality (i.e. set up the validation) and then validate that the AUT produces the expected result. Often the Designer adds more keywords (and values) to return the AUT to the [[Initial value problem|initial condition]] (i.e. tear down after the validation).

Here is an example hotel reservation entry-validation-and-cancel test case:

&lt;div align=center&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

===Keyword Design===
Keywords are the basic, reusable building blocks for keyword test design. Keywords define actions that drive or get information from application objects. Keywords are defined with an action-descriptive keyword name (e.g. Hotel Reservation System Start, Hotel Reservation Enter, Hotel Select, Reservation Confirmation Validate, or Hotel Reservation Close) and keyword argument names (e.g. Country, City, CheckinDate, CheckoutDate). Each keyword (for GUI applications) is associated with one (or sometimes more) GUI windows. Each keyword argument may be associated with a window object, like a list-box or a button. Reuse of Keywords ensures rapid test development and easy maintenance.

Keywords are created by Test Designers in anticipation of usage within Keyword Test Cases or, more commonly, the keywords are created on-demand, as needed when the Keyword Test Case is being implemented. Keyword argument names are created with the Keyword. Keyword argument values, on the other hand, are entered into test cases, as described above, to serve the purpose of each test case. The values are text and can be used to be

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; An explicit argument value&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; An expression including &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; Variables&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; Functions&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; Combinations of variables and explicit values&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Also note that not only are keywords the basic, reusable building blocks for keyword test design, but they are also the basic components of test automation implementation. Run time test execution is called keyword by keyword.

===Data Tables===
For some tests, the tester needs to execute the test case repeatedly using different values for each iteration. This is enabled with a Data Table. The test case keyword argument values use variables. The Data Table is populated with values associated with the variables used in the test case. The test case will execute as many times as there are records in the Data Table.

Data Tables consist of Records and Columns:

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Records – Collections of values used in each iteration of the Test Case&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Columns – The columns headers are the variable names and the data below are the values associated with each variable in the test case iterations. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

==Keyword Implementation==
Although Keyword Test Case Design, described above, and Test Set Execution, described below, can apply to either manual or automated tests, this section, Keyword Implementation, applies only to automated tests.

===AUT Object Identification and Naming===
Keywords and keyword arguments interact with the AUT windows and objects like list-boxes and buttons. Each of the windows and objects are uniquely identified within the operating system. Although they have a long list of attributes, generally only a few are required to differentiate one object from all others active during test execution. So, if the few attribute values of each window and each object are mapped to a unique object name, then the processing of the tests can interact with the objects, by name using a default method for the object type or some other method determined by the testers.

===Association of Keyword Arguments and AUT Objects===
Given a defined keyword including its keyword name and named arguments and given a map of windows and objects uniquely identified by name, the keyword can drive AUT action only if the keyword is tied to a named window and the keyword arguments are tied to named objects. The association must also include the method to be used for each of the keyword arguments. Usually the method is the default for a standard object type but on the other hand the object may be unusual or even if it is a standard object, the testers may want to interact with the object using a custom method.

===Association of Keywords to Pre-Existing Execution code===
The implementation of keywords may take absolutely no additional coding. With typical AUT implementations, the code, here called a template, can be common for many keywords. Templates can pre-exist, either built into the framework or created within a project to be reused for many keywords. There may be a handful of templates that each serve different purposes like value entry or value validation or some other variant needed within the project for test navigation, set up, validation or tear down. So, the keyword implementation is then simply achieved by association of the keyword to a template.

The keyword argument processing described above is called from the template. Templates typically include more than calls to keyword argument processing. Code may also include: checks to see that the AUT is ready for interaction; common navigation before and/or after keyword argument processing; error handling; or additional functions and calls. The template code can be quite modest or as extensive as needed. In any case, the template serves as common code to implement many keywords.

===Facility to Address AUT Complexity===
However, sometimes AUT complexity requires more code for special circumstances. Some keyword implementation may be quite unique and so require code for only that one keyword. That complex keyword might start life as a copy of a template but then be modified for the unique circumstance or it may be much more complex. The complex keyword, like a template, would typically provide checks, error handling, navigation, and keyword argument processing.

Some AUT complexity may be in objects commonly used within the AUT. Custom object code written as a method to deal with the complexity can be called from templates, usually, or from complex keywords in processing of the keyword arguments.

The framework also enables libraries of other common functions related to custom objects, complex keywords, or project templates.

==Test Set Execution==
===Aggregate and Reuse Test Cases for Each Major Test Purpose===
Keyword test cases can be reused extensively. The intent of each test case is to validate some functionality of the AUT and to always yield the same result. However, each test case may be used many times within test sets of different scope or purpose. A test set may be used for a smoke test, for example, or a much more complex functional test that may run for days, or a system test, or an acceptance test.

===Run Manual Tests===
As described above, test cases are built from keywords that have meaningful, action descriptive keyword names, with argument names that tie to AUT objects like list-boxes and buttons (most often defined by captions, legends, or other useful identifying text) and test case keyword argument values that are applied to the AUT or compared to AUT displayed values. The keyword test cases are based on definitions that are meaningful to people not just to machines. So, a useful framework also provides facility to capture results and provide reports from manual execution.

===Execute Automated Tests===
Automation is built on the Keyword Implementation, as described above, and requires another level level of code. A test case processing engine reads (otherwise people friendly) test case keywords and keyword argument values to programmatically and efficiently drive the AUT and report results.

Chapter 2: Racial Imbalances


Throughout the United States today there is a continuously growing population of minority groups. The U.S is experiencing a huge growth in multicultural education. The white race is shrinking as other races are drastically increasing. In 2005, minorities accounted for about 33% of the nations population. The population also increased in the education systems. The Hispanic race contributed to most of the growth in minority groups (Gollnick, Chinn, 2009). “ From 1999 to 2005, the number of students taking Advanced Placement Exams increased by a larger percentage among minority students than among white students” (National center for education statistics). Student behavior plays an important role in the performance of children in and out of school, as do the roles of the parents. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, displays a good example of how children no matter their ethnicity, gender, stature or capability to succeed, are to be treated equally. These are all factors that greatly influence the racial imbalance in the school systems (National center for education statistic). 

The growth among minorities in the U.S has vastly increased since the 1990’s. The Hispanic division has outnumbered the African American division and has grown tremendously over the past decades. A group called the Asian/Pacific Islanders is another group discovered growing rapidly in the states. From 1990 to 2005 this group grew from 3.2 million to 12.8 million. Minorities are going to continue to grow rapidly in the upcoming years and may some day outnumber the white Americans. It is said that by the year 2020 the minority population will grow about 32% (National center for education statistics). 

Student conduct and parent involvement both play an important role in the lives of succeeding students. If a child is struggling in the classroom there is a slightly higher chance that he/she may end up rebelling, quitting school or making bad choices in life. Some minority children may feel out of place and distant from other children. They may feel as though they are being ignored or forgotten because of their racial identity, subsequently, causing them to fail in school. Parent involvement is an added bonus to succeeding and continuing education. The more parents interact with their children, statistics show, the better they do in school. Most minority parents are not concerned about the curriculum schools are teaching. They believe the schools know what they are doing, so they do not get involved. This however, is not true and most children will greatly benefit from being taught in the classroom as well as out of the classroom (Vang, 2006). 

The NCLB or No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 was produced in order to improve the education for the disabled and underprivileged students. Former President George W. Bush signed this act into law on January 8, 2002 (Research Center). However, many have argued that it has only made learning more difficult for children. One main goal of the NCLB was to close the achievement gap between white students and poor or minority students. Throughout the nation achievement gaps exists among minorities and their white counterparts (Subnet, 2009). Research concludes that along with poor academic performance, a main factor that contributes to school failure rates is mainly social imbalances (Lagara-Riordan, Aguilar, 2009). There should be a drastic change in the system and the way things are being dealt with. By going through every piece of information and data gathered from the faculty, students and parents and reassessing the issue may indeed help strengthen the system. 

In Taunton, Massachusetts a man by the name of Author W. Steller has transformed a few of the public schools into successful places of employment. He has exceeded in raising the dropout rate from 4.2% to 6.8%. One school finished first in English language arts and finished second in math out of 22 other schools on the same district. One particular fourth grade class had 80% of their children in the low-income division. Most of them were on free or reduced lunches with little money to spare. The class finished third highest in math among the states 1,176 elementary schools. It seems Steller is on the right path. By instilling in parents how important education is to their children, he has successfully raised the attendance levels. By succeeding in raising attendance and the dropout rate, Steller rewards his schools with new whiteboards or computers (Ullman, 2009). However, not every school is able to buy new technology such as computers or whiteboards but there are alternate ways in which to give rewards such as, parties, removing homework for a week, etc. 

The role minorities play in society and in the school systems are changing due to vast growth throughout the U.S. The Hispanic race is the largest minority group in the United States today. While minority groups are growing both in percentage and numbers, they are widely spread throughout the country. They represent the highest number in the regional population with 44%. The population in the south is about 37% and in the northeast about 28% (National center for education statistics). With all the changes in race and culture come changes in the school systems and how children are being taught. Schools are going to have to adapt to the different cultures and languages, meaning, other sources of teaching will have to be available in order for everyone to learn equally.

Chapter 2 Racial Imbalances 


It is no secret that there is a race gap in test results, graduation numbers and drop out rates in schools. There are numerous reasons for all of this. Some say the richer will have better test results than the poorer, or depending on what environment the person is apart of has an effect on score, or simply ethnicity and background have a role in the results of test on students in school. Every reason someone has thought upon on why test results have such an enormous race gap in test have been tested. The racial imbalance in schools across America is one of the top issues facing schools today. “Large numbers of nation’s children leave school, with a and without high school diplomas, barely able to read, write, and do simple math. But the failures of schools are not evenly distributed.” (Berlak) This chapter discusses instances on White Flight, the causes of achievement gaps between races, faculty composition, and our current legislation involving racial imbalances.

White Flight is the “sociologic and demographic term denoting the trend wherein white people flee desegregated urban communities, and move to other places like commuter towns; although an American coinage, “white flight” denotes like behavior in other countries.” (Wikipedia)  White Flight took place after World War II in the early 1950’s in most suburban areas. In 1954 two very important US Supreme Court cases terminated desegregation. Instead of being “separate, but equal”, the separate has been dropped and everyone has equal right. Before desegregation was ruled out of schools across America, yes everyone had equal rights, supposedly. It was not anywhere near equal. Non-whites had it very harsh with very unreasonable rules about where they had to sit, drink or even walk. Even during the time period where the government had terminated and abolished the “separate, but equal”, some people still did not agree or follow by the law. They found ways around it. For instance, sending their white children. Another type of white flight was cultural white flight. Cultural white flight involved “withdrawing white children from the mixed-race public school system and matriculating them to private schools unaffected by U.S. federal anti-racist laws.” (Wikipedia) So even after the termination of the desegregation, some people still try to separate the children by making sure the white students went to a private school. Some people have never and will never understand that race and color do not matter. Eventually after a certain amount of time, all schools were racially mixed. 

Schools have always had charts, tables or graphs that show them the differences in age, gender or race results of testing. And since schools have been segregated it is easier to have results of race within one school. One test that is given in public schools is the National Assessment of Educational Progress. This one particular example shows the achievement gaps between African Americans and Whites in the Mathematical and Reading areas. They chat testing results based on age or grade. “At grade 8, mathematics gaps existed in 2007 in the 41 states for which results were available. The gaps were narrower in 2007 than in 1990 in four states: Arkansas, Colorado, Oklahoma, and Texas. In all four, scores for both Black and White students increased, but scores for Black students increased more.” (Anderson, Hamilton, &amp; Vanneman) And for reading “at grade 8, reading gaps existed in 2007 in 41 of the 42 states for which results were available…There was no significant change in the gap in ay state from 1998 to 2007.” (Anderson, Hamilton, &amp; Vanneman) So from the test we can determine within the same year, one subject in school my have a large or small achievement gap and another may not have an achievement gap at all. Another test that shows a racial imbalance in test results would be that SAT. In this test result, we are shown all the races with the average SAT score, which consists of math and verbal test results together.


“SAT Ethnic Group Scores 
                                  (Math/Verbal+total) 
                 
                 American Indian---482/480 (962) 
                 Asian American-----575/508 (1083) 
                 African American-----426/431 (857) 
                 Puerto Rican----457/448 (905)
                 Other Hispanic----464/457 (921)
                 White-----534/529 (1063) 
                 Other ----513/501 (1014)”                 (Blackexcel.org)

The SAT score results do not show much of a difference between the racial groups. The ACT results do the same. On the average, the scores range from 19 to 22 between the racial groups. Every test always has racial achievement gaps or imbalances. Some have very small gaps that do not make much of a difference and others have enormous gaps. One thing that would help our achievement gaps is our faculty. 

Faculty members have different ways of improving the racial imbalances in their classrooms. Some faculty believes that having a smaller class will help improve the achievement gaps in testing. “The results indicate that, while students are in small classes, average test scores increase by 7-10 percentile points for black students and by 3-4 percentile points for white students.” (Krueger, A) Reading further on in this paper, you learn that after being placed back in a regular size class from the smaller class, both Whites and African Americans test scores increased. Faculty have also studied and tested if the smaller class have an affect on the SAT and ACT. “We also find that having attended a small class compared to regular-size class raises the likelihood that black students take the ACT or SAT college entrance exams from 31.8 to 41.3 percent, and raises the likelihood that white students take one of the exams from 44.7 to 46.4 percent.” (Krueger, A) Another way teachers improve achievement gaps are after school programs. This gives the children extra time to practice their skills they need to know to do well in school. In order to improve achievement gaps teachers cannot be the only ones who try to improve, the government has to have a part in what they believe is right. 

The current legislation we have right now trying to improve the achievement gaps in test results and the drop out rates of students is the “No child left behind” program. While we are still trying to work this out and to see if it will actually work, some people believe it will and others believe it won’t. Everyone has his or her own opinion on this program.

I believe that achievement gaps are very important in schools across the United States. It not there to tell us who is smarter in certain areas, it is there to show us and help us in the areas that need help. If there is a drastic achievement gap in math scores, well maybe smaller classes should be looked at for math. I think achievement gap results in the end help us understand the children that are taught and it makes the faculty ask themselves, what can we do to fix this achievement gap?

Chapter 3: Poverty 

Camden Campus 


Meeting the challenges of poverty and understanding how poverty relates to and impacts student academic achievement requires much more from teachers than just teaching but rather an understanding of social awareness as well as a level of empathy and genuine concern for students and their families. What will help us achieve this level of understanding further is to grasp where our achievement gaps are with lower income students as well as how to effectively reach them and provide opportunities for their growth and progress.

In order to successfully and effectively begin to meet the challenges that poverty presents to modern education, we must first understand and change our social knowledge and, perhaps more importantly, our social perception of what poverty is. The literal definition of poverty is “being poor; need, scarcity or lack”. With the overall unemployment rate of 7.2%, a 15 year high according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, many families really are just a paycheck away from poverty. This reality, I feel, has led to more acceptance and understanding in respect to our myth of the culture of poverty; however, there are still many misconceptions of low income learners. Some of those misconceptions include being lazy, live on welfare, are wasteful, abuse drugs and alcohol, more prone to violence and do not value education (Surridge, 2008). These misconceptions have all been proven wrong and many times are perpetuated by parents, police and the media. Many individuals who do collect welfare do so for only a short time as the result of having lost their job. “Despite popular notions that so much of the US budget is spent on welfare, less than 1% goes toward welfare (Surridge, 2008).

New measures for poverty that take into account the costs of housing, food, other necessities, transportation for work and federal income/payroll taxes suggest that the rate of poverty is significantly higher than that suggested by the official measure (Hernandez, Denton &amp; Macartney, 2009). Many school districts are seeing the number of low income students doubling, as many as 1/10 students being homeless. It is not hard; therefore, to see that homelessness and unemployment are “enormous complexities facing public schools in our country” (Thomas, 2009) and that teachers must learn to cross social boundaries to make learning meaningful and relevant for all students.

Early intervention programs can minimize the negative impacts of poverty on students’ development and learning (Isikoglu &amp; Ivrendi, 2007). Since the enactment of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) in 1965, various federal programs have been created to support education improvement and target additional resources to meet the education needs of children who are economically and educationally disadvantaged (Chambers &amp; et al, 2009). While schools rely on many of these programs to supplement their budgets, it would appear that much of the level of funding has become stagnant and does not change fast enough in respect to cost of living expenses. For example, “… at the school level, Title I funding per low-income student in the highest poverty schools remained unchanged from 1997-98 to 2004-05” (Chambers &amp; et al, 2009).

How do we solve this? What do we do to narrow the achievement gap for low income students? Perhaps our answer is closer to home than we think. While federal programs and budgets are indeed critical in respect to providing the funding schools need, the “…single most important ingredient that has an effect on student achievement is the quality of the teacher in the classroom…” (Thomas, 2009). Appreciating this, it makes sense that our mission as teacher professionals, our solution is in the teacher education program itself as well as in the selection and retention of good teachers. How do we measure good teachers? Perhaps we adopt the philosophy of unique talent and ability and recognize that teaching as a profession is much more than about teaching~~it requires the ability to create and foster relationships with people. Good teachers care about the well being of each individual student and they receive intrinsic satisfaction from watching students develop and reach their potential. No, it’s no longer just teaching a process but rather providing a level of care for people that extends beyond the school walls and school hours and fosters an environment in each classroom of community and high expectations for all students so that teachers may “move students to higher levels of accomplishment without using poverty, race or gender as an excuse for students not to achieve” (Surridge, 2008).

Within the teacher education program, we must look at ways to identify the talent and ability of candidates applying to the teaching profession so that the selection process, and therefore the retention of teachers, begins here rather than after graduation when so many times school in desperate need of teachers and just needing a position filled are perhaps not giving their own selection process their highest priority in respect to the best person for that position. Factors that seem to contribute to teachers staying in high-poverty urban schools, besides a state scholarship program, include a high sense of mission which was reinforced and developed by the teacher education program and a disposition for hard work and persistence which was reinforced and developed by the teacher education program…and ongoing support from members of the teacher cohort as well as other supportive professional networks (Freedman &amp; Appleman, 2009). 54.1% of participants in a Department of Teacher Education program were not satisfied with the program because they argued that the programs failed to meet practical demands in different everyday situations of the classroom…(Payne, 2008).

“Molding the next greatest generation of Americans is exciting but also a huge responsibility. There are many demands of time and accountability placed on teachers and we have to appreciate that and make them feel valued in the compensation they receive. This will not be achieved by enacting furloughs (time off without pay) which has been the most recent response by schools reacting to state and national budget cuts in education. This certainly is going to affect turnover in a profession where stability, especially for students where school may be their only stability in the day, is paramount.

Once inside the classroom, teachers can meet the needs of low income students by making them feel ok and by not lowering their expectations of what those students can achieve. While there are many successful programs which include free meals, transportation, free school supplies as well as extensive support for parents, the consistent response that I found from teachers and what they believe makes the most significant impact in narrowing the achievement gap for low income students is to hold them to the same standards as any other student in their classroom.

Chapter 3: Poverty 

One of the many problems that face our nation today is poverty. Poverty in the United States is cyclical; roughly twelve to seventeen percent of the US population is below the poverty line at any given time, and up to 40% will fall below in a ten year span. In 2007, 14.3% of the United States population was below the poverty line (United States Census Bureau, 2009). The impact of poverty is seen in many places; however, one of the more evident places is in the classroom.  Even though it is extremely difficult for a child to perform at the required level when facing so many problems at home, poverty is no excuse for a child to not succeed in academics. Students can neither be excused nor scolded for not knowing, but as educators it is our job to provide support and make sure they overcome their obstacles and meet expectations. Being in poverty is rarely a lack of intelligence or ability; two things that will help bring one out of poverty are education and relationships (Payne, 1996). Although poverty tends to haunt generations, solid relationships and a sound educational background can open a new successful pathway. 

For an individual student, the most common way to define poverty is by whether or not the student receives free or reduced lunch. In order for a child to receive free or reduced lunch, their parents’ income must fall under a certain amount. For example, for a child in a family of four to receive reduced school lunches their parents’ salary must be less than $40,793. For that same child to receive free school lunches their parents’ salary must be less than $28,665 (Georgia Department of Education, 2008).  A large amount of research shows that students who are eligible for free or reduced lunches are more at risk for academic failure. A high concentration of low income learners seems to have a negative effect on students, teachers, and the school. However, low income students in low poverty schools score better than low income students in high poverty schools. Low income learners do better academically in a classroom where the majority of the students are economically advantaged. The one factor that leads to higher achievement for low income students is the availability of skilled teachers. Students are most likely to be successful when they are enrolled in classes with both low and high income learners in socioeconomically diverse schools (Department, 2001).

There are roughly 73 million children in the United States and 39% of them live in low in-come families. This day in age school is not being taught or conducted in the same ways it has in the past. More and more students are bringing poverty culture with them to school, and fewer students are bringing middle class culture. Education is the key to getting children out of poverty and breaking the tradition of generational poverty. School is basically the only place a low income, impoverished student can learn the middle class culture. When former impoverished students who have successfully climbed their way to middle class are asked how their journey was made, nine out of ten times their answer has to do with a teacher, counselor, coach, or some other kind of relationship where a role model has made an impact on their life. These role models face many difficulties when dealing with impoverished students. They see children come into their classroom hungry from not eating at home, tired from not being able to get enough rest, frustrated, and violated. There are ways around these problems all while keeping high expectations for the students. The first thing a teacher should do is learn about their students’ background and where they come from. Getting in touch with his or her parents thru email or phone is crucial. Getting such background information early on is helpful throughout the year. Next, a teacher should establish and enforce high expectations. All students can learn, however each learn at their own individual level and pace. Teachers should constantly remind their students of the expectations they have for them and also let them know they believe and have faith in their ability. External challenges should never be an excuse in the classroom. Finally, teachers should adapt to student challenges. Each child faces a different life after they leave the classroom; each one goes home to a different family with different backgrounds. High expectations should be set for all students, but different solutions should be in place for those children who need extra help meeting their goals. A teacher’s job is not always easy, but always worth the time and effort put forth (Hougan, 2009).

Although many problems face the students of this nation, one of the most prominent problems is poverty. Poverty not only affects children in their homes, but also spills over to affect their academic achievement. Poverty is no excuse for a student to not excel and achieve their goals. Education is the one thing that can bring a child out of poverty and take them into a middle class society. Without education this nation would be completely impoverished. It is our responsibility as teachers to be role models impoverished children can look up to in order to set higher goals for themselves.

Chapter 3: Poverty 

In January 2009, the United States was ranked highest in childhood poverty in all the nations (Smith, 2009). Many people do not fully understand poverty. So what is poverty? There are many different definitions. The most common definition in the Webster New Spanish-English Dictionary is: the state or condition of having little or no money, goods, or means of support (2002). According to the WCPSS, the poverty level of an individual student is based on whether or not the student is eligible to receive free or reduced-price lunch (1999). The poverty level of a school is determined by the percentage of students eligible or not eligible to receive free or reduced lunch (WCPSS, 1999). Poverty will affect over one-third of American’s during their childhood (Jones, 2007). Researchers’ have found that there is a circle between poverty and low education (Human Rights Facts, 2008). Several studies have shown childhood poverty to be associated with poor performance in academics, lower IQ scores, and an increased risk of dropping out of school (Jones, 2007). How do we break this ongoing circle? Teachers are a significant importance to poverty children and can help overcome the challenges of poverty. Educators must be able to overcome the challenges of poverty including the diversity in the classrooms, achievement gaps between the students, and the motivation of students learning. 

Our nation’s classrooms are more diverse than ever before. Diversity is not only a challenge for teachers, but also the students. The challenge for the teacher is to provide the children with an efficient multicultural education that will further awareness, respect, and acceptance (Pellino, 2007). The students living conditions and their life experiences have a great impact on their education. High-mobility and irregular school attendance are just a few of the symptoms of poverty (Pellino, 2007). Along with these symptoms some teachers may notice that children dealing with poverty are more aware of economy at a young age. Students learning about cultural differences at an early age will help their understanding over the years. As students get older, teachers may include community service learning projects in the curriculum, to help further the student’s knowledge (Pellino, 2007).  Real-life problem solving and learning experiences will help students use their strengths, skills, and knowledge to develop a desire to learn. Teachers can stop diversity by helping the children become more understanding and accepting of other cultures. 

Achievement gap is the difference in academic performance among children from different classes or groups (Pellino, 2007). Studies have shown children of poverty achieve at lower levels than children of middle and upper classes (Research Watch, 1999).Why is this? Two of the main reasons are the social environment and the education the children receive in school (Spagnoli, 2008). Some of the influences on student achievement include: quality of student learning behaviors, home environment, past experiences with education, and the teacher’s attitude toward the student (Pallino, 2007). Researchers believe this can change, and all students can succeed if pushed to achieve their full potential. Teachers should be knowledgeable of each student’s culture. This will help the teacher to plan useful and interesting lessons. Effective teaching is the key to closing the achievement gaps (Pellino, 2007). 
Another challenge of poverty is the student’s motivation to learn. Children of poverty face many emotional issues throughout their lifetime. These issues are usually very stressful and may cause depression or anxiety (Pellino, 2007). Most poverty children often lack emotional security, and self-esteem (Pellino, 2007). Low or no self-esteem can take the motivation to learn out of children. The teacher should start by helping the student rebuild his or her self-esteem. A teacher may build a trusting relationship with each student, to help the student feel important and loved. The goal is for the child to feel secure and good about themselves. Finding the positive in the negative is also very important for a teacher to remember, when teaching a poverty child. Negative criticism can cause poverty children to tune teachers out. The teacher’s responsibility is to make learning an enjoyable, interesting experience. 

Poverty effects the child physically and mentally, and often develops at an early age. Teachers should provide support to encourage the student and their families. Parental involvement should be encouraged to help their children succeed. Early education for children will help reduce child poverty, as well as, improve a child’s health (Smith, Fauth, &amp; Gunn, 2009). School funding should be equal in every school throughout the United States, so each child will have the resources necessary to promote the best possible learning experience. Teachers should create activities and lessons that will encourage and build the student’s self esteem. Poverty should not be an excuse for a teacher to expect less from the student. Focus on the students learning and find ways to help them overcome these difficult challenges. The key to ending the vicious circle of poverty is through a good education (Spagnoli, 2008).

Chapter 1: Student Academic Performance 


The United States must address the challenges in its educational system, if it wants to maintain a competitive edge.

Academic performance refers to how students deal with their studies and how they cope with or accomplish different tasks given to them by their teachers. This article will shed light on the current issues facing the students today. Of course we have heard it time and time before that receiving an education is the most important thing. But students today are facing the dropout epidemic, which occurs often during the ninth grade year, low scores in math, science and reading. And if that is not enough, the workplace continues to change and the demands continue to rise on those making the transition from the classroom to the workplace. Americans no longer compete with each other for jobs; it’s now the international students getting jobs (www.all4ed.org). 

Internationally there are two surveys that compare the U.S. with other countries. The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) are the two main assessments of comparing the U.S. with other countries. Both assessments reflect the performance of students several years before they complete high school. PISA targets fifteen-year old students’ ability to apply what they have learned in school to real-world problems. By contrast, TIMSS tests fourth and eighth grades. TIMSS follows the school curriculum closely (Koretz, 2009).
How does the United States rank among other countries academically? The U.S. ranks 21st of 30 O.E.C.D. countries in scientific literacy, and the U.S. score of 489 fell below the O.E.C.D. average of 500. One quarter (24.4%) of U.S. fifteen-year olds do not reach the baseline level of science achievement. This is the level at which students begin to demonstrate the science competencies that will enable them to use science and technology in life situations (U.S. Department of Education).

The math literacy in the United States ranks 25th of 30 in O.E.C.D. countries, the average score of 474 fell well below the O.E.C.D. average of 498. Scores have not measurably changed since 2003, when the United States ranked 24th of 29 countries. Over one quarter (28.1 percent) of American fifteen-year olds performed below the baseline level of mathematics proficiency at which students begin to demonstrate skills that enable them to use mathematics actively in daily life (U.S. Department of Education). Moreover, there are other problems facing the U.S. along with the low science and math scores. In 2003, the U.S. ranked 15th of 29 O.E.C.D. (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries in reading literacy, with a score of 495, the score came near the O.E.C.D. average of 500 (U.S. Department of Education). It is a well known fact that a large majority of our nation’s students are not reading on grade level and this will have devastating effects on a student’s ability to learn. Boling and Evans (2008) report that more than eight million American students cannot read or comprehend what they read even at a basic level. The reading epidemic is leading so many dropouts, and the numbers are disturbing (www.nationalforum.com).  

The dropout epidemic is continually on the rise and many more students will not make it if this trend continues.Over a million of the students who enter ninth grade fall fail to graduate (www.all4ed.org). Among them blacks and Latinos fare worse in the epidemic. For every student who dons a cap and gown and marches across the stage in auditoriums and halls across the country, there is a student who will not finish high school. The drop-out rate among Black and Latino high school students is nearly 50%. In some major urban areas, such as Cleveland and Indianapolis, more than 60% of students fail to graduate from high school each year. According to America’s Promise Alliance (www.AmericasPromise.org), an organization pledging support to young Americans founded by retired Gen. Colin Powell and his wife Alma Powell, about 1.2 million students-7,000 kids everyday-dropout of high school each year (The Dropout Epidemic: A Crisis of Human Capital). Dropouts significantly diminish a student’s chance to secure a good job and a promising future. Moreover, not only do the individuals themselves suffer, but each class of dropouts is responsible for substantial financial and social costs to the communities, states, and country in which they live (www.all4ed.org).

When a student decides to dropout of school it not only costs them a education it also puts strain on the U.S. Dropouts suffer from reduced earnings and lost opportunities; there is also a significant social and economic cost to the rest of the nation. Over the course of his or her lifetime, a high school dropout earns, on average about $260,000 less than a high school graduate (www.all4ed.org). Dropouts from the class of 2008 alone will cost the nation more than $319 billion in lost wages over the course of their lifetimes (Alliance for Excellent Education, 2008). 

Who is dropping out? Overall majority of the students not graduating on time with a regular diploma are low income and minority students fare the worst in the dropout epidemic (www.all4ed.org). Each year, approximately 1.2 million students fail to graduate from high school, more than half of whom are from minority groups. Nationally, about 71 percent of all students graduate from high school on time with a regular diploma, but barely half of African-American and Hispanics students earn diplomas with their peers. In many states the difference between white and minority graduation rates is stunning; in several cases there is a gap of as many as 40 or 50 percentage points. 

Where are the students dropping out? A relatively small number of chronically underperforming high schools are responsible for more than half of the nation’s dropouts. Approximately two thousand high schools (about 12 percent of American high schools) produce more than half of the nation’s dropouts. The number of seniors enrolled is routinely sixty percent or less than the number of freshmen three years earlier. Why are the students dropping out? While there is no single reason for students dropping out, research indicates that difficult transitions to high schools, deficient basic skills, and lack of engagement serve as prominent barriers to graduation (www.all4ed.org).

Most dropouts are already on the path to failure in the middle grades and engage in behaviors that strongly correlate to dropping out in high school. Researchers have identified specific risk factors, such as low attendance or a failing grade, which can identify future dropouts-in some cases. Ninth grade tends to serve as a bottleneck for many students who begin their freshman year only to find that their academic skills are sufficient for high school-level work. Up to 40% of ninth grade students in cities with the highest dropout rates repeat ninth grade; only 10 to 15 present of those repeaters go on to graduate ( Balfanz and Legters, 2006). Those who drop-out are more likely to be incarcerated, rely on public programs and social services  

Many students are not given the extra support they need to successfully make the transition to high school. As a result, over one third of all dropouts are lost in ninth grade. The six million secondary students who comprise the lowest 25% of achievement are twenty times more likely to drop out of high school than students in top-performing groups. Both academic and social engagements are integral components of successfully navigating the education pipeline. Research shows that a lack of student engagement is predictive of dropping out, even after controlling for academic achievement and student background (www.all4ed.org). 

Many factors play a role in a student’s academic performance. The student also needs the right teacher in the class room on top of everything else. Quality teaching is one of the most significant factors in improving student performance, and closing the gap between the lowest and highest performing students. 

The information that was found gave me more insight into how the U.S. was performing academically. I went from my topic to the key points that needed to be addressed with my paper and I realized that the U.S. was not in the top percent with other countries. The drop out epidemic issue informed me of the problems that we as a country are facing. I can relate to the drop out issue more so than any other issue because I was a former drop out of high school at one time in my life. I feel that every problem has a solution but the real issue is finding the solution to the problems. In my opinion one of the solutions to the problems that the United States is facing will take the country, community, school, family and student to make the changes happen.

Chapter 1: Student Academic Performance 

Now more than ever, students have to compete internationally for jobs but the gap between the United States school performance and schools of other developed countries is growing and the United States is sadly falling behind. The US graduation rate is slowly increasing, but still lags when compared to other developed countries. The rate of people graduating from college in the United States is lowering. Test scores when compared to other developed countries are lower in the United States. People from other nations are coming here for school, when many people here could careless about higher education. The country that was once thought of as the “leader” of the world is slowly losing that title. 

In 1980 the drop out rate was 14.6 million it has decreased to 8.7 in 2007(NCES 2009-081). Although the dropout rate is lowering, it is lowering very slowly.  Even with teenage pregnancy on the rise, the dropout rate continues to lower, I think that shows that teens are realizing they can do more than one thing, whereas before If they got pregnant they just quit school all together. 

In 2006 the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study was conducted among fourth graders in 45 jurisdictions including 38 countries, 5 Canadian provinces, and the separate Flemish- and French-speaking education systems in Belgium. The US scored higher than peers worldwide (NCES, 2006). Now we are trying to focus in on the STEM( Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math subjects) In 2007 the TIMSS was given to 4th and 8th grade internationally, The US 4th and 8th graders scored higher than average on the math section The fourth graders ranked 9th out of 36 countries who were given the exam and the eight graders ranked 6th out of 48. The countries ranking higher were from Asia and Europe in both cases. In the science section the US 4th and 8th graders again placed higher than the TIMSS average. The 4th graders ranked around 6th and the 8th graders ranked 10th(NCES 2007). The United States showed a large improvement in the math section of the Trend in International Mathematics and Science Study from 1995 when it was given for the first time. The science section did not have a noticeable change.  Student academic progress is on the rise but there are many things we can do to continue its success. 

First we can start by lowering the drop out rates even more and getting more people into college.  Eduardo Padron wrote in his book that community colleges should partner with local school to help prepare students for college. I think that would be the first step to getting more people enrolled, coming from a small town where many high school graduates are first generation college students attending a community college they have no clue what to expect, I think it should be a mandatory class for all seniors to have a college prep class that solely gets them ready for college. Padron also suggests reaching out to those sets at risk or dropping out for whatever reason, if those students are reached by a teacher they can be set up on a plan to make sure they get the required classes and help needed to graduated.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Basics ==

The goal of this section is to understand how objects move in fully two dimensions.  By contrast, one-dimensional motion concentrated on motion strictly along the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; axis.  Two dimensional motion is where an object undergoes motion along the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; axes &quot;at the same time.&quot; The position of an object in two-dimensional space can be plotted by its &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; coordinate. These coordinates are found by the equations 

&lt;math&gt;x=x_0+v_{0x}\Delta t+\frac{1}{2}a_x\Delta t^2&lt;/math&gt;

and 

&lt;math&gt;y=y_0+v_{0y}\Delta t+\frac{1}{2}a_y\Delta t^2&lt;/math&gt;.  

Note that also evolving as an object moves are its speeds along two axes as well via 

&lt;math&gt;v_x=v_{0x}+a_x \Delta t&lt;/math&gt; 

and  

&lt;math&gt;v_y=v_{0y}+a_y \Delta t&lt;/math&gt;.  
[[File:Free fall velocity vectors.gif|thumb|x and y components of velocity under free fall]]
Remember that the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; coordinates are perpendicular to each other, that is the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; axes are orthogonal. This is a special relationship in math and physics, and means that processes along one axis do not affect processes along the other axis. Therefore, whatever happens along the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis does not affect what happens along the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; axis, and vice-versa. This is a key concept to understand.  Two-dimensional motion is sometimes called &quot;projectile motion&quot; which encompasses objects flying through space under the influence of gravity.  Baseballs, cannon balls, basketballs moving through space are all examples of projectile motion. Near the surface of the earth, projectiles in flight are restricted to motion where &lt;math&gt;a_x=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_y=-g=-9.8&lt;/math&gt; m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  You can immediately find forms of the &lt;math&gt;x=&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=&lt;/math&gt; equations above, given these restrictions.  You can also find &lt;math&gt;v_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_y&lt;/math&gt; equations, noting that &lt;math&gt;v_x&lt;/math&gt; will always be equal to a constant (v&lt;sub&gt;x0&lt;/sub&gt;) since by orthogonality, g (gravity) only affects y and v&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;.

== The Need for Vectors ==

At any given time, your object will have four quantities describing its motion: &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;v_x&lt;/math&gt;,  and &lt;math&gt;v_y&lt;/math&gt;. Since position and speed now each have two components (or parts),  position and speed will be &quot;vectors,&quot; called &lt;math&gt;{\vec r}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\vec v}&lt;/math&gt; respectively. &lt;math&gt;{\vec r}&lt;/math&gt; will consist of  two components, the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; coordinates of the object. Similarly, &lt;math&gt;{\vec v}&lt;/math&gt; will consist of the components &lt;math&gt;v_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_y&lt;/math&gt;.  As you will now see,  the two components of both &lt;math&gt;{\vec r}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\vec v}&lt;/math&gt; gives them both a magnitude (strength, length, etc.) and direction, which you must know how to handle.  

=== Vectors: magnitude and angle ===

There are two ways of dealing with vectors, and you should be proficient with both. The first way is in &quot;magnitude-angle form,&quot; where you report the magnitude of the vector and the angle at which it is pointing. For the position, the magnitude (or total distance from the origin) is &lt;math&gt;r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}&lt;/math&gt;. The angle this vector will make relative to the +x-axis is given by &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\theta=\tan^{-1}\frac{|y|}{|x|}&lt;/math&gt;.  The absolute value signs are important to remove any negative values that might pop up and ensure the angle is with respect to the +x-axis. The velocity vector is tracked similarly, namely &lt;math&gt;v=\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\alpha=\tan^{-1}\frac{|v_y|}{|v_x|}&lt;/math&gt;,  where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the angle the velocity vector makes with respect to the +x-axis, and is essentially the direction the object is moving in at that instant of time. Be sure you understand why a vector has a magnitude and an angle, and be sure you can always compute both from a given vector's components.  

=== Vectors: Component form (or i,j,k notation) ===

The other way of handling a vector is in &quot;component form.&quot; In this form, you list each component directly, next to a unit vector specifying what axis the component goes to.  So if an object is &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt; meters along the x-axis and 2 m along the y-axis then &lt;math&gt;{\vec r}=5{\hat i}+2{\hat j}&lt;/math&gt;,  where &lt;math&gt;{\hat i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\hat j}&lt;/math&gt; are unit vectors meaning x-axis and y-axis, respectively.  Likewise, if an object has an x-component of velocity of 3 m/s and a y-component of -2 m/s, its velocity vector would be &lt;math&gt;{\vec v}=3{\hat i}-2{\hat j}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Circular Motion ==

The other type of two-dimensional motion that is important is circular motion, which describes how an object moves in a circle.  In this type of motion, the object is always has an acceleration that points toward the center of the circle around which it traveling.  If you choose a circle of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and want the object to move around the circle with a speed &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;,  then the strength of the acceleration, called the &quot;centripetal acceleration&quot; must be &lt;math&gt;a=\frac{v^2}{r}&lt;/math&gt;,  and it must always point toward the center of the circle.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Bangladesh =

&lt;font size=3&gt;Bangladesh achieved independence from Pakistan in December 1971. A small number of unaltered Pakistan meter stamp designs were used after this date, but most dies were altered to remove or obliterate all references to Pakistan. Stamps with new Bangladeshi designs came into general use around 1976.


The stamps are grouped according to appearance and function:
: '''A''' - Provisional designs made from altered Pakistani dies
: '''B''' - Stamps used for private and business mail
: '''PO''' - Stamp designs generated by Post Office meters


Bangladesh meter stamps contain the user’s name or initials in the town mark in addition to the identity of the licensing post office. Town marks of Post Office stamps show the post office identification only, and this is usually the only way to separate Post Office stamps from privately licensed meter stamps. This may be difficult to do for stamps issued since the mid-1980s when town marks in Bengali only (without English) first appeared.

      <comment>/* Friction */  Friction is also part, but not the totality of the drag</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
In this chapter, we use Newton's Laws to see that accelerations actually come from forces applied to an object.  In the chapters on one and two dimensional motion, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; was simple a &quot;given&quot; quantity.  It simply existed in the equations of motion and you were allowed to give it any value.  In this chapter, we will see that accelerations come from '''forces'''.   Forces are pushes or pulls on objects that you witness everyday (push a door to open it, pull on your book to lift it, push a cell phone button to click it).  With the exception of gravity, forces are always &quot;contact forces&quot; meaning a force must actually touch an object to exert its influence on it. Forces also require an agent, meaning that you should always be able to identify what (the agent) is producing the force. Forces are also vectors, meaning their strength (push or pull) can be in any direction. The SI unit of force is aptly named the Newton, and is symbolized by &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;''N''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;.

== Newton's Laws ==
You probably know that Newton's Law says &lt;math&gt;F=ma&lt;/math&gt;, but this is not always the most useful equation to try and use in a physics course.  &lt;math&gt;a=\frac{F}{m}&lt;/math&gt; is better, but still isn't quite right. It is more correct to say that &lt;math&gt;a=\frac{\Sigma F}{m}&lt;/math&gt;, which still isn't fully correct.  The best version is  &lt;math&gt;{\vec a}=\frac{\Sigma {\vec F}}{m}&lt;/math&gt;, stressing the vector property of forces. Be sure you fully understand what this last version means and how to use it. &lt;math&gt;{\vec a}&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the object's mass and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma{\vec F}&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of all forces acting on the object.

== Types of forces == 

We will only be concerned with five forces: weight, tension, normal, friction, and drag. 

=== Weight ===

Weight is &lt;math&gt;w=mg&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is an object's mass and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the Earth's acceleration of gravity of &lt;math&gt;9.8&lt;/math&gt; m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The weight &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; of a body is equal to the magnitude &lt;math&gt;F_g&lt;/math&gt; of the gravitational force on the body. Do not confuse mass and weight; they are not the same thing and be sure you know the difference between them. Mass is also known as object's inertia, or resistance to want to change its current state of motion. A person who has mass 80 kg, has mass 80 kg on Earth, and on Jupiter. However, the person's '''weight''' on Jupiter is substantially greater due to the magnitude of the gravitational force on Jupiter.

=== Tension ===

If a cord is attached to an object, and then the cord is drawn taut, the force experienced by the object is called tension. The tension vector has the same direction as motion vector, meaning that tension is only experienced when an object is pulled, never when it is pushed.

=== Normal Force === 

Normal is the force an object feels when it is sitting on a surface, is always perpendicular to the surface, and is not always equal to &lt;math&gt;mg&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Friction ===
Friction is a force that always opposes all motion; it always acts in a direction exactly opposite to that in which an object is moving (or trying to move), and typically comes when the surface rubs or drags against another as it moves.  It is defined as &lt;math&gt;{\vec f}=\mu{\vec N}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of friction, and &lt;math&gt;{\vec N}&lt;/math&gt; is the normal force acting on the object. There are two types of friction, static and kinetic, also known as sliding friction.

Static friction is equal to the amount of initial force required to move an object, and kinetic friction represents the minimum amount of force required to sustain motion of an object. Because of this, static friction is always greater than or equal to kinetic friction.

=== Drag ===
Drag is the resistance that a fluid offers to an object moving in it. Fluid in this case also applies to any substance that acts like a fluid, for instance air. It is also sometimes called air resistance or fluid resistance.

Drag forces depend on velocity, they always acts in a direction opposite to that of oncoming flow velocity (e.g. as a plane is passing trough air, the air will generate a drag force). This relationship is documented in the equation &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;D-F_g=ma&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;, because the vectors representing drag and motion are in opposite directions.

The drag force on an object is proportional to the density of the fluid and to the square of the relative speed between the object and the fluid, and so drag is related by the equation &lt;math&gt;D=\frac{1}{2}CpAv^2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the drag coefficient, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the effective surface area that encounters the resistance, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the fluid density, and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the object's speed.

== The key point ==

The crux of this entire chapter is &lt;math&gt;\Sigma {\vec F}&lt;/math&gt;, because it requires three hard steps. The first, which most students have great difficulty with, is to identify all forces acting on an object. The second is to correctly draw these forces, each pointing in the proper direction, as they act on the object (even more difficult for most students). The third is to realize that &lt;math&gt;\Sigma{\vec F}&lt;/math&gt; which is only usable when you break it up into component form, or &lt;math&gt;\Sigma F_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma F_y&lt;/math&gt;.  Your working equations for this week are then &lt;math&gt;a_x=\Sigma F_x/m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_y=\Sigma F_y/m&lt;/math&gt;.

== Connections with kinematics (an object's observed motion) ==

The connection points with the chapters on one and two dimensional motion are that these accelerations, which come from forces, are the same ''a'''s that go into the equations of motion for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;x=x_0+v_0\Delta t+\Sigma F_x\Delta t^2/(2m)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_x=v_{0x}+\Sigma F_x\Delta t/m&lt;/math&gt;. Be sure these make sense to you and do not casually read over the &lt;math&gt;\Sigma F_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma F_y&lt;/math&gt;. Know what they mean: Using Newton's law is a way of finding the acceleration on an object, and this really means that all forces acting on an object need to be broken up into their &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; components, properly signed (+ or -), then added together along a given axis to then find a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and a&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;.

{{closed|Closed as [[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' as stubs only have link spam in them.  Links to far more useful study guide PDFs added to [[DSST]].  Those can be used to create books with actual content later via the links on the same page. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:09, 4 September 2009 (UTC)}}
Seems to be an advertisement because it only has one thing in it, an external link to a collage website. [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 15:17, 26 August 2009 (UTC)

NO SPEEDY DELETE - VFD instead. What is DSST? [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 15:22, 26 August 2009 (UTC)

{{comment}} It seems like these pages were created and then left for others to expand, they all have a link to the page where you can get a fact sheet for the test. Should these be left or deleted or moved into one book, I am talking about all the books in [[:Category:DANTES_Subject_Standardized_Tests]]? They could prove helpful to those taking the course. We could make the outline he talks about and have it link to wikibooks that talk about that subject. I think it might be good if we would merge these into one book. The user that made these pages is [[User:Wellvrsd]]. [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 15:43, 26 August 2009 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' There's an outline at [[DSST]].  These books need to remain separate, however, like the various books in [[:Category:GCE Advanced Level]].  They are not intended to be combined into one and I would oppose such a move.  Keep them all or delete them all but don't merge them together. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:43, 26 August 2009 (UTC)

: [[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' all of these. There is value in the links on those books linked from [[DSST]] so I doubt we gain anything from deleting them. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 18:34, 26 August 2009 (UTC)
:: The links can be useful but just by themselves they do not constitute Wikibooks material, as middle ground solution, and as advanced by [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]], a project named &quot;DANTES Subject Standardized Tests&quot; (by renaming of the [[DSST]] page) should be created and all lose pages be made part of that same project, give it some time (6+ months) to see if it evolves beyond a collection of external links and if it does not we shouldn't keep it just because it is a collection of the links, since that can't be described as textbook material [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks?]].  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:43, 27 August 2009 (UTC)
::: These collections of links are useful as a spring-board for prospective editors to add content. There is no gain in deleting these.
::: Unless the test is usually called by it's full name, the acronym is more appropriate. The Wikipedia [[w:DSST (standardized test)|entry]] title is the acronym and given it's military origin it's not hard to imagine that this is the colloquial form. I've created a redirect at [[DANTES Subject Standardised Tests]] in case anyone searches for that term. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 07:34, 27 August 2009 (UTC)

::I think it should still be called &quot;DSST&quot;, and I think the link is provided as a reference to start writing. You have to go in and find the fact sheet for the article you want to write. After more studying I have come to the conclusion that these are for students to use as a test prep. I don't think we should rename them, I was just using the full category name. I also agree we should keep them separate. I will eventually make a note of what I think it is. I just learned what they are from reading the main user's page and talk: [[User:Wellvrsd]]|[[User talk:Wellvrsd]] [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 02:20, 27 August 2009 (UTC)
:::Keeping the title of DSST will obfuscate the subject. I advanced that title also in consideration to the ongoing discussion about book titles. What is that you see as beneficial in keeping the pages separated ?
:::I only skimmed the pages and indeed there is no real content to talk about, all project titles seems to share the definition DANTES (I didn't knew what it refereed to before reading it [http://www.dantes.doded.mil/DANTES_WEB/EXAMINATIONS/DSST.htm here] and I see no benefit in keeping the related links separated especially as each page would need a very similar introduction to what it is, where the tests are accepted and other shared and necessary information.
:::I haven't a real position on what to do here, except that I share the view that the effort put to create the listing could constitute a stub but if no work is done, it will fail as be material for Wikibooks.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:39, 27 August 2009 (UTC)

::::I added links to the PDF files for each test to [[DSST]], which is better than what many of the stubs had.  The stubs just had a link to the website, where readers then had to find the PDF.  Now the pertinent information is linked to from the central page.  [[DSST A History of the Vietnam War]] needs to be [[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''kept''', but I don't care about the stubs now that better links/their content is on another page which most definitely won't be deleted.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:52, 27 August 2009 (UTC)
:::[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' creation of pages to promote site. See other pages created the same way [[Special:Contributions/Wellvrsd]]. If the pages aren't deleted the link(s) should be removed. The idea of adding links here is to get traffic for the site by using [[w:Search engine optimization|Search engine optimization]] via the search engines. [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 14:29, 28 August 2009 (UTC)

* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.

== welcome ==

Welcome to Wikibooks.
Thank you for putting together [[A Guide To PIC Microcontroller Documentation]] -- it looks like it has a lot of potential.
I hope you enjoy editing and seeing what others write in that book and other Wikibooks that mention PIC micros --
such as [[Embedded Systems/PIC Microcontroller]] and [[RC Airplane/RCAP]].

== Your tutorial on arrows ==

Hello,

I just noticed the the [[Haskell/StephensArrowTutorial|arrows tutorial]] you wrote three years ago, and I am shocked at how it has been overlooked for so long. In my opinion, it is a perfect replacement for the unfinshed [[Haskell/Arrows]]. I will incorporate it into the book, as soon as I finish some cleanup work in the monad chapters and refresh my memory on arrows (probably by using your tutorial!). Thanks a lot!

{{recipe}} | Soup

This gazpacho is a cold soup that is  wonderful to taste and refreshing to serve during the warmer months.  The peach flavor adds a variation on the traditional more Spanish combination of tomato, bell pepper, and cucumber.  Gazpacho is popular throughout Spain, Portugal and Latin America.  This particular version is more modern and is especially easy to make as little chopping is needed if you use the blender as described.

==Ingredients==
*4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] (946 [[Cookbook:Milliliter|mL]]) = 1.5 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb.]] (630 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]]) [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
*2 cups (473 mL) = 1 lb. (454 g) pitted [[Cookbook:Peach|peaches]]
*0.25 cup (59 mL) crushed ice
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|T]] (30 mL) chopped [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallot]]
*2 T (30 mL) [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*1.5 T (22 mL)  white-wine [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
*1 T (15 mL) chopped fresh [[Cookbook:Tarragon|tarragon]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|t]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*0.5 t [[Cookbook:pepper|black pepper]]
==Equipment==
Medium size bowl. Small size bowl.  Blender (strong enough to chop ice).  Knife for cutting vegetables. Cutting board.  Measuring cup. Measuring spoons.  Scales optional.
==Procedure==
#Cut the tomato into sections and place into medium size bowl
#Set aside one third of the tomato sections and place into small size bowl
#Cut the pitted peaches into sections and place into medium size bowl
#Set aside half of the peach sections and place into small size bowl
#Cut the shallot into sections and place into medium size bowl
#Chop the fresh tarragon removing and discarding any large stems 
#Pour half the contents from the medium size bowl (tomato, peach, shallot) into a blender and purée for 45 seconds on highest power
#Add olive oil, white wine vinegar, tarragon, salt, and pepper to blender
#Add remaining contents from the medium size bowl into the blender and purée for 45 seconds on highest power
#Add crushed ice into the blender and purée for 30 seconds on highest power
#To thicken or chill more, add additional ice if needed
#To thin, add water instead of ice to achieve desired consistency
#Add contents from small bowl into blender and pulse blend on lowest setting very briefly (this will provide some texture to gazpacho with small chunks of tomato and peach)
#Serve right away as chilled gazpacho soup

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*For garnish sprinkle some fresh tarragon leaves on the gazpacho
*To add some variety, add a dollop of greek yogurt or sour cream to the center
*You can purée all the ingredients in one batch, then add the ice and blend to make a smoothie
*You can substitute a red onion for shallot

This gazpacho is a cold soup that is  wonderful to taste and refreshing to serve during the warmer months.  The peach flavor adds a variation on the traditional more Spanish combination of tomato, bell pepper, and cucumber.  Gazpacho is popular throughout Spain, Portugal and Latin America.  This particular version is more modern and is especially easy to make as little chopping is needed if you use the blender as described.

==Ingredients==
*4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] (946 [[Cookbook:Milliliter|mL]]) = 1.5 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb.]] (630 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]]) [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
*2 cups (473 mL) = 1 lb. (454 g) pitted [[Cookbook:Peach|peaches]]
*0.25 cup (59 mL) crushed ice
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|T]] (30 mL) chopped [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallot]]
*2 T (30 mL) [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*1.5 T (22 mL)  white-wine [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
*1 T (15 mL) chopped fresh [[Cookbook:Tarragon|tarragon]] ''(8 sprigs)''
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|t]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*0.5 t [[Cookbook:pepper|black pepper]]

==Equipment==
Medium size bowl. Small size bowl.  Blender (strong enough to chop ice).  Knife for cutting vegetables. Cutting board.  Measuring cup. Measuring spoons.  Scales optional.
==Procedure==
#Cut the tomato into sections and place 2/3 into the blender, set the other 1/3 to the side in the  small bowl
#Run the blender on high speed to purée the tomatoes
#Cut the pitted peaches into sections and place 1/2 into the blender, set the other 1/2 to the side in the small bowl
#Add the peaches to the tomato purée and blend on high speed to purée the peaches
#Cut the shallot into sections and place into the mixture and purée
#Chop the fresh tarragon removing and discarding any large stems and place the leaves into the blender mixture and purée
#Add olive oil, white wine vinegar, tarragon, salt, and pepper to blender and mix well
#Add crushed ice into the blender and purée for 30 seconds on highest power
#Add contents from small bowl into blender and pulse blend on lowest setting very briefly (this will provide some texture to gazpacho with small chunks of tomato and peach)
#Serve right away as chilled gazpacho soup

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*For garnish sprinkle some fresh tarragon leaves on the gazpacho
*To add some variety, add a dollop of Greek yogurt or sour cream to the center
*You can purée all the ingredients in one batch, then add the ice and blend to make a smoothie
*You can substitute a red onion for shallot

Gazpacho is a cold Spanish tomato-based raw vegetable soup, originating in the southern region of Andalusia. Gazpacho is widely consumed throughout Spain, neighboring Portugal (where it is known as gaspacho) and parts of Latin America. Gazpacho is mostly consumed during the summer months, due to its refreshing qualities.

* '''Bhagavad Gita''' (Sanskrit: भगवद्गीता), ''Bhagavad Gītā'', &quot;Song of God&quot;, is one of the most important sacred Hindu scriptures. It is revered as one of the most sacred scriptures of Hinduism. The Bhagavad Gita comprises 700 verses and is a part of the ''Mahabharata''. The teacher of the Bhagavad Gita is Krishna; who is revered by Hindus as a manifestation of the Lord Himself and is referred to within as ''Bhagavan'' — the divine one.  The Bhagavad Gita is commonly referred to as '''The Gita'''.

* '''Bhakti''' (Sanskrit: भक्ति), ''devotion'' or ''portion''. In practice signifies an active involvement by the devotee in divine worship. The term is often translated as &quot;devotion&quot;, though it has been suggested that a better rendering would be &quot;participation&quot;. One who practices ''bhakti'' is called a ''bhakta'', while ''bhakti'' as a spiritual path is referred to as ''bhakti marga'', or the ''bhakti'' way. ''Bhakti'' is an important component of many branches of Hinduism, defined differently by various sects and schools. The practice of ''bhakti'' emphasises devotion above ritual.

So may he stimulate [''pracodayāt''] our prayers [''dhiyas nas''].&quot;

* '''Gupta Empire''' (गुप्त राजवंश} ''{ Gupta Rājavaṃśa'') was an Ancient Indian empire which existed approximately from 280 to 550 AD and covered much of the Indian Subcontinent. Founded by Maharaja Sri-Gupta, the dynasty began the ''Classical Age'' in the Middle kingdoms of India. The capital of the Guptas was Pataliputra, present day Patna, in the north Indian state of Bihar.

* '''Hare Krishna:''' The '''International Society for Krishna Consciousness''' ('''ISKCON'''), also known as the '''Hare Krishna''' movement, is one of the Hindu Vaishnava religious organizations. It was founded in 1966 in New York City by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.

* '''Kāma''' (Sanskrit: काम) is pleasure, sensual gratification, sexual fulfillment, pleasure of the senses, desire, eros, the aesthetic enjoyment of life in Sanskrit. In Hinduism, ''kāma'' is regarded as the third of the four goals of life (purusharthas): the others are duty (dharma), worldly status (artha) and salvation (moksha). '''Kama-deva''' is the personification of this, a god equivalent to the Greek Eros and the Roman Cupid. '''Kama-rupa''' is a subtle body or aura composed of desire, while '''Kama-loka''' is the realm this inhabits, particularly in the afterlife.

* '''Mahabharata:''' (Devanāgarī: महाभारत}, Mahābhārata) one of the two major Sanskrit Indian epics of ancient India, the other being the ''Rāmāyaṇa''. The epic is part of the Hindu ''itihāsa'' (literally &quot;history&quot;), and forms an important part of Hindu mythology.

* '''Mahajanapadas''' (Sanskrit: महाजनपद, ''Mahājanapadas''), literally &quot;Great realms,&quot; (from ''Maha'', &quot;great&quot;, and ''Janapada'' &quot;foothold of a tribe&quot;, &quot;country&quot;) were Ancient Indian kingdoms or countries. Ancient Buddhist texts like ''Anguttara Nikaya''  make frequent references to sixteen great kingdoms and republics (''Solas Mahajanapadas'') which had evolved and flourished in the north/north-western parts of the Indian subcontinent prior to the rise of Buddhism in India.

* '''Mantra:''' (Devanāgarī: मन्त्र) A sound, syllable, word, or group of words that are considered capable of &quot;creating transformation&quot;. Originating from the Vedic tradition of India and later becoming an essential part of Hindu tradition and a customary practice within Buddhism, Sikhism and Jainism.

* '''Manusmṛti''' (Sansktir: मनुस्मृति), also known as '''Mānava-Dharmaśāstra''' (Sanskrit: मानवधर्मशास्त्र), is the most important and earliest metrical work of the Dharmaśāstra textual tradition of Hinduism. Generally known in English as the ''Laws of Manu'', it was first translated into English in 1794 by  Sir William Jones, an English Orientalist and judge of the British Supreme Court of Judicature in Calcutta. The text presents itself as a discourse given by the sage called Manu to a group of rishis, who beseech him to tell them the &quot;law of all the social classes&quot;.  Manu became the standard point of reference for all future Dharmaśāstras that followed it.

* '''Moksha:''' (Sanskrit: मोक्ष} ''mokṣa'') or '''Mukti''' (Sanskrit: मुक्ति}, literally &quot;release&quot; (both from the root ''muc'' &quot;to let loose, let go&quot;), is the liberation from samsara, the cycle of death and rebirth or reincarnation and all of the suffering and limitation of worldly existence. 

* '''Murti''' (Devanāgarī: मूर्ति) typically refers to an image, a deity, in which a Divine Spirit is expressed (''murta''). Hindus consider a murti worthy of worship after the divine is invoked in it for the purpose of offering worship. Thus the murti is regarded by Hindus and also by some Mahayana Buddhists (e.g. Muktinath) during worship as a point of devotional and meditational focus.

* '''Patañjali''' (Devanāgarī: पतञ्जलि) (fl. 150 BCE or 2nd c. BCE is the compiler of the Yoga Sutras, an important collection of aphorisms on Yoga practice, and also the author of the Mahābhāṣya, a major commentary on Panini's Ashtadhyayi.  However, whether these two works are by the same author is disputed. 

* '''Prahlada''' is a character from the Puranic texts of Hinduism, wherein he is famed for his exclusive devotion (bhakti) to Vishnu, despite attempts in the story by his father, Hiranyakashipu to turn him to the contrary. He is considered a ''mahajana'', or ''great devotee'', by followers of Vaishnava traditions and is of special importance to devotees of Narasimha avatar. A philosophical treatise is acredited to him in the Bhagavata Purana wherein Prahlada describes the process of loving worship to his lord, Vishnu. The majority of stories in the Puranas are based around the activities of Prahlada as a young boy, and thus he is more commonly depicted as such in paintings and illustrations.

* '''Prasāda''' (Sanskrit: प्रसाद, Marathi: प्रसाद, Hindi/Urdu: प्रशाद/پرشاد/''prashad'', Kannadal: ''prasāda'', Tamil and Malayalam: ''prasādam'', Telugu: ''prasadam'') is both a mental condition of generosity, as well as a material substance that is first offered to a deity (in Hinduism) and then consumed. The act of offering food to a deity is in accord with Eastern traditions of hospitality with the god as a revered guest.

* '''Pūjā''' (Devanāgarī: पूजा) (alternative transliteration '''Pooja''', Sanskrit: reverence, honour, adoration, or worship) is a religious ritual performed by Hindus as an offering to various deities or distinguished guests.

* '''Recension''' is the practice of editing or revising a text based on critical analysis. When referring to manuscripts, this may be a revision by another author. The term is derived from Latin ''recensio'' &quot;review, analysis&quot;.

* '''Redaction''' the reduction of a body of text usually for editorial or societal reasons or through loss of subject data.

* '''Rishi''' (ṛṣi) denotes a poet-sage through whom the Vedic hymns flowed, credited also as divine scribes.  According to post-Vedic tradition the rishi is a &quot;seer&quot; or &quot;shaman&quot; to whom the Vedas were &quot;originally revealed&quot; through states of higher consciousness.  The rishis rose into prominence when Hinduism was in its early flowering, perhaps as far back as four thousand years ago.

* '''Sanskrit:''' (संस्कृता वाक्) ''saṃskṛtā vāk'', for short (संस्कृतम्) ''saṃskṛtam''. Historical Indo-Aryan language, one of the liturgical languages of Hinduism and Buddhism, and one of the 22 official languages of India.

* '''Shakha''' (Sanskrit: शाखा} &quot;branch&quot; or &quot;limb&quot;, is a Hindu theological school that specializes in learning certain Vedic texts.

* '''Shiva:''' (Sanskrit: शिव) Hindi for &quot;Auspicious one&quot;, also known as '''Rudra''' (the &quot;Feared One&quot;). A major Hindu god and one aspect of Trimurti. In the Shaiva tradition of Hinduism, Shiva is seen as the Supreme God. In the Smarta tradition, he is one of panchadeva - the five primary forms of God.  

* '''Sindoor''' is a red powder (Vermilion), which is traditionally applied at the beginning or completely along the parting-line of a woman’s hair (also called '''mang''') or as a dot on the forehead. Sindoor is the mark of a married woman in Hinduism.

* '''Sūta''' (Sanskrit:सूत) refers both to the bards of Puranic stories and to a mixed caste. According to ''Manu Smriti'' (10.11.17) the sūta caste are children of a Kshatriya father and Brahmin mother. The narrator of the several of the ''Puranas'', Ugrasrava Sauti, son of Lomaharshana, was also called Sūta.

* '''Terminus post quem''' and the related '''terminus ante quem''' are terms used to give an approximate date for a text. ''Terminus post quem'' is used to indicate the earliest point in time when the text may have been written, while ''Terminus ante quem'' signifies the latest date at which a text may have been written.

* '''Vāk''' or '''Vāc''' (stem ''vāc-'', nominative ''vāk'') is the Sanskrit word for &quot;speech&quot;, &quot;voice&quot;, &quot;talk&quot;,  or &quot;language&quot;, from a verbal root ''vac-'' &quot;speak, tell, utter&quot;. Personified, Vāk is a goddess, most frequently she is identified with Bharati or Sarasvati, the goddess of speech. In the Veda she is also represented as created by Prajapati and married to him; in other places she is called the mother of the Vedas and wife of Indra.

* '''Vishnu''' (Sanskrit: विष्णु), (honorific: Bhagavan Vishnu), is the Supreme God in the Vaishnavite tradition of Hinduism. Smarta followers of Adi Shankara, among others, venerate Vishnu as one of the five primary forms of God (panchadeva). He is exalted as the highest God in Hindu sacred texts like the ''Taittiriya Samhita'' and the ''Bhagavad Gita''. He is the '''Guru Kshethram''', representing Bṛhaspati, or Jupiter, in the ''Navagraha'', or nine cosmic influences.

* '''Vyāsa''' (Devanāgari: व्यास)  is a central and revered figure in the majority of Hindu traditions.  He is also known as '''Badarayana'''. He is also sometimes called '''Veda Vyasa''' (वेद व्यास, ''veda vyāsa''), (the one who split the Vedas) or '''Krishna Dvaipayana''' (referring to his complexion and birthplace). He is accredited as the scribe of both the Vedas, and the supplementary texts such as the Puranas. A number of Vaishnava traditions regard him as an avatar of Vishnu. Vyasa is also considered to be one of the eight Chiranjivins (long lived, or immortals), who are still in existence according to general Hindu belief.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===WALKING BY FAITH===
When the Law was given, it was the duty of the priests to teach the people the Law and its application to their daily lives. But after the return of the Israelites from captivity into Babylon, corruption began to take hold of the priesthood through the infiltration of Greek influences, and the people lost confidence in the priesthood.
Filling this gap, a sect called the Pharisees gained popularity as they took over the role of teaching the people.
Houses of learning, called synagogues were established and these laymen began teaching the people what has been called the Oral law, i.e. how to interpret the general principles of the Law of God into situations of life. For instance, the Law says to remember to keep the Sabbath day holy and to refrain from work on it. The Oral law spelt out the details of how to keep the day holy and what would be considered as work etc.on the Sabbath.
And so, the Oral law (Works of the Law) took precedence over the Law of God in what was taught to the people.

===LEGALISM===
Legalism is bondage, whereas we have been called to freedom in Christ. 
Yeshua invited His followers into a relationship with Himself and the Father, saying, &quot;Come unto Me, all you who labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart and you will find rest for your souls.&quot;  (Matthew 11:28-29)
Firstly, it is a call to an ongoing relationship with Him which will result in inner rest and assurance, because He is not a harsh and domineering overseer. Being harnessed to Him is not a restrictive bondage but a corrective process of being conformed to His likeness which releases us from the burden of our own sins and shortcomings and the fruitless efforts of attempting to achieve our own righteousness, into true life and liberty.

Yeshua called the Pharisees of His day to account because they were abusing the authority they had of sitting &quot;in Moses' seat&quot; to instruct the people regarding the application of the Law to the situations of daily life; saying &quot;For they bind heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on men's shoulders&quot; instead of drawing them closer to God in their relationship, they were binding the people up in ritual and legalistic observances (Matthew 23:1-4).

They also exercised an illegitimate authority in corrupting the Word for their advantage (Matthew 15:1-9; 23).

They were, in effect, teaching the commandments of men as the decrees of Yahweh God (Isaiah 29:13).

Much of His teaching was in correction of the scribes and Pharisees.
For instance, Yeshua walked in liberty regarding the Sabbath and taught men so. The Pharisees accused Him of  breaking the Sabbath and doing what was &quot;not lawful&quot; to do according to their interpretation (Matthew 12:2). If He had broken the Sabbath, it would have been sin and He would have been an imperfect sacrifice. So, although it was the scribes and Pharisees accusation that He broke &quot;the law&quot;, it was not an actual fact that He did break the Law, regarding the Sabbath. It just went against their 'law' - i.e. their interpretation of how to apply the law in various situations of life. As He said, &quot;It is lawful to do good on the Sabbath&quot; (Matthew 12:12)

It was all about the things which one could and could not do, on the Sabbath according to the regulations which had been compiled into the body of 'laws' to govern their behaviour in all situations of life which they referred to as &quot;the law&quot;. This collection of laws was called &quot;The Works of the Law&quot; and was referred to often by Paul.

The difficulties which Paul faced in his ministry from the believing Jews undermining his work, stemmed from this very thing. Having sat at the feet of Gamaliel, the most prominent teacher of the time, he excelled in all the teaching of the Jews, which included the oral law interpretations and applications from the Mosaic law. He also had been guilty of the same thing through his zeal for &quot;the traditions of my fathers&quot;, in persecuting the early assembly. Having the excellent tuition in all the legalities of the interpretation of the Oral Law of his day, he was the ideal choice, to father the fledgling assembly through the troubled waters of legalism from other brethren who were also zealous for the traditions of the fathers (Galatians 1:11-24;  Philippians 3:5-9 ).

The &quot;traditions&quot; based upon the Law had become legalism, and these &quot;Works of the Law&quot;, the interpretation of the Law, were the dominating and dividing factor of every sect of Judaism at the time.

===THE WORKS OF THE LAW===
The Dead Sea Scrolls brought to light a document called  Miqsat Ma’ase Ha-Torah, or MMT, which translated means the Precepts of the Law, or the Legal Rulings of the Law.  This document was a collection of sacrificial and purification rites and many other regulations regarding Sabbaths and holy days which was written by the sect of the Essenes at Qumran. It was an extremely legalistic articulation of every detail of their lives to maintain ritual purity, and which had a large influence as one of the sects of Judaism in the first century. The contents of this document did not become included in the oral law of the Talmud because the Pharisaical sect was the only one which continued after the dispersion of the Jews. So the knowledge of this body of the 'law' which the Essenes used, as well as the terminology for it, passed away. As a result, this type of terminology has not been understood until the discovery of this document in the Dead Sea Scrolls. 

The Talmud which was the written form of the &quot;works of the law&quot; of the Pharisees, was not transcribed from oral to written form until well after the dispersion, and for that very reason it became necessary. No other sect of Judaism survived after the destruction of the temple, and so, their traditions became the standardised form of Oral law which have been accepted as the traditions of Judaism, and is current today in Rabbinic Judaism.

The discovery of this document has revealed that when Paul used the term &quot;works of the law&quot; he was using a terminology which applied to Oral teaching of the law such as the Essene (Qumran) sect held. In the Greek the equivalent of &quot;works of the law' (ergoon nomou) is used in the Septuagint to translate the Hebrew term 'ma’ase ha torah'. The term &quot;ergoon nomou&quot; is the term used by Paul which is translated into English as the &quot;works of the law&quot;. These &quot;works of the law&quot; in the contemporary use of the term in Pauls' time, refer to oral laws based upon the Law of God, and not to the actual keeping of the Law in itself.
 
===LEGALISM IN THE ORAL LAW===
In the Essenes Oral law, as part of their focus on ritual purity, Abraham, Phineas and others, were held up as examples of those who were accounted righteous with Yahweh through their righteous acts, or works of righteousness. On that basis, great effort was made to be scrupulously correct in every observance of the Law, so as to be righteous. The emphasis was on the &quot;deeds of the law&quot; and not on the faith relationship that motivated obedience to the Law. This is the emphasis which the Judaisers tried to bring in to the believers.

Paul corrects this error concerning Abraham at length in Romans 4 and Galatians 3, to show that him being accounted righteous was by faith alone apart from &quot;works of righteousness&quot;. This whole concept of ritual purity by works of righteousness was a counterfeit teaching in opposition to walking in the Spirit; as he said to them, 
&quot;Having begun in the Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh?&quot;  (Galatians 3:3)

He was not negating obedience to the Law of God by this, but counteracting the legalistic interpretations of how to apply the Law to one's personal life which was to be by the guidance of the indwelling Spirit of God, in the new covenant. The oral law had a purpose in the old covenant in giving them direction and guidance.

This was Moses seat of authority, to interpret the Law to varying needs, problems and circumstances for the people (Exodus 18:13), which became a shared authority after Jethro's divinely-given wisdom (Exodus 18:17-26). This was the function and position which the Pharisees were fulfilling in the second temple era. But with the impartation of the Holy Spirit, this became unnecessary, as Yeshua said, He would now be their Helper, Comforter, Counsellor and Teacher and they needed no man to teach them (John 14:16-18,26; 15:26-27; 16:7-15).

The role of the Holy Spirit did away with the need of the Oral law for personal guidance in interpreting the application of the Law of God into individual situations of life, for His followers in the new covenant. It did not do away with the Law itself, but it personalised and internalised the Law. The new covenant believer was to walk by faith in the personal guidance of the Holy Spirit applying the principles of the Law of God to his life.

It was no longer a walk according to knowledge of the written Law, but a walk of faith by the Spirit of God.

This blend of green leaf vegetables is reported to help pull toxic metals out of the body.  The original recipe didn't have the ginger and was too bitter tasting.  Increasing the citrus taste from the pineapple and the lime helps make the green juice more palatable.  The ginger adds an additional layer of complexity.

*238 g  (8 oz.) [[Cookbook:chard|Swiss chard]] or [[Cookbook:Collard Green|Collard greens]] ''(6 large leaves)''
*124 g (4 oz.) fresh [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] ''(1 small bunch)''
*26 g (1 oz.) fresh [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] root ''(1 small piece)''

==Equipment==
[[Cookbook:Juice Extractor|Juice extractor]]. Knife to peel and cut fruit. Cutting board.

==Procedure==
#Squeeze the juice from 3 limes into the container where the juice extractor dispenses the juice
#Cut the pineapple, removing the outer spiny flesh, the top, the bottom and the pithy core
#Cut the pineapple into long thin strips that can be easily inserted into the juice extractor
#Run the pineapple through the juice extractor
#Tear the greens into smaller pieces that can be put into the juice extractor easily
#Run the greens through the juice extractor
#Run the cilantro through the juice extractor
#Run the ginger root through the juice extractor
#Serve the green juice over ice (makes about 2 cups)

==Notes, tips, and variations==

Leader's Prayer 
“May it be Your will that the tekiah-shevarim-Teruah-tekiah blasts that we sound tonight be embroidered into the heavenly curtain by the appointed angel and be accounted like the prayers of Elijah, through Y'shua our High Priest and minister of the Inner Sanctuary, so that Your mercy may be upon us.

7. MESSAGE.     (Ephesians 5:1-20)
In the traditional Jewish service of Yom Teruah, the Shofar was blown 100 times.  The blowing of the Shofar is firstly a call to alert and awaken the conscience of man and initiate his response to the call of  the Shofar to come into His Presence.

The Shofar pierces the darkness of this world's spiritual atmosphere which keeps man bound under the deceptions of the god of this world and penetrates the heart of man for him to hear the sounds of the Shofar - that is, the message of the Shofar.  It makes a way for the Word of the Almighty to penetrate the heart for the purpose of bringing man to an acknowledgement of his need of repentance against a holy God.

The Jewish Rabbi Maimonides explained the meaning of the sounds of the shofar as follows:
&quot;Awake, you sleepers from your slumber, and rouse you from your lethargy. Scrutinize your deeds and return in repentance. Remember your  Creator, you who forget eternal truth in the trifles of the hour, who go astray all your years after vain illusions which can neither profit nor deliver.  Look well into your souls and mend your ways and your actions; let each one of you forsake his evil path and his unworthy purpose, and return to God, so that He may have mercy upon you.&quot;

Paul reiterated that in speaking to the Ephesians when he counselled them to be imitators of him and &quot;walk in love as Messiah also loved us and has given Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling aroma.   But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not be named among you, as is appropriate for the saints of God; neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor coarse jesting, which are not right, but rather giving of thanks in all things to God.  For this you know that no fornicator, unclean immoral person, nor a covetous man who is an idolater of the things of this world, has any inheritance in the kingdom of the Messiah and God.  Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon those who are disobedient.   Therefore do not be partakers with them. . . . .  Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness or those who practice them, but rather expose them. . . . .  All things that are exposed are made manifest by the light.   Therefore He says, 
&quot;Awake, you who sleep,  Arise from the dead, and Messiah will give you light.&quot;
See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools but as wise people, redeeming the time, because the days are evil.&quot; (paraphrased and expanded from  Ephesians 5: 1-16)

The apostle Peter also exhorts us to consider what manner of person we ought to be in holy conduct and godliness with the approaching Day of God in which the world and everything in it will be dissolved, saying, &quot;Therefore, beloved,  looking forward to these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, without spot and blameless;&quot;   (2 Peter 3:11-14)

The day of Yom Teruah is understood prophetically to herald the beginning of the Tribulation period.  The Shofar blown on this day is called the Last Shofar/Trumpet.  The Shofar had been blowing in the Temple for thirty days previously, to call the people to prepare, and on Yom Kippur the Great Shofar will be blown which will herald the coming of Messiah. The message of the Shofar on Yom Teruah is an alarm to prepare for the coming judgment.

On the memorial of this day, the Messiah will ascend the throne for His coronation as King of kings and the thrones will be set for judgment.We need to watch and pray that we may be accounted worthy to escape the coming judgment and be found of Him in peace at His return, whenever that may be. (Luke 21:36
The blowing of the Shofar on Yom Teruah symbolizes the prevalence of Mercy over Judgment for those who come in repentance and seek His forgiveness for all their sins.

John says that if we say we have not sinned we deceive ourselves and His truth is not in us.  We need to allow the light of His Word to shine into our hearts and examine us according to His holiness.  (1 John 1: 5-8)

Our eternal destiny will be decided by our spiritual condition when this final day arrives.  Yom Teruah is different from every other Feast, in that it has no prescribed date and is dependent on the arrival of the new moon which is concealed from view. So that day will come upon us, if we are not prepared and catch us unaware.  We need  to watch and be sober and keep our spiritual garments white and unspotted from this world.

Festive celebration of God's goodness by the partaking of apples dipped in honey, followed by a festive meal of sweet dishes.

Leader: May it be Your will, O Yahweh, God of our fathers, to grant us a blessed and prosperous Year. (Everyone partakes of apple slices dipped into honey)

&quot;Your mercy O Yahweh is in the heavens; Your faithfulness to the clouds.  Your righteousness is like the great mountains; Your judgements are like a great deep; O Yahweh, You preserve man and beast.

How precious is Your lovingkindness, O God!  Therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of Your wings.  They are abundantly satisfied with the fullness of Your House, and You give them drink from the rivers of Your pleasures.  For with You is the fountain of life;  In Your light we see light.&quot;  Amein  (Psalm 36: 5-9)

We trust Yahweh our God, to soon behold Your majestic glory when all abominations shall be removed and all iniquity shall be at an end.  Then shall the world be perfected under the rule of our mighty King and all mankind shall call upon Your name through Y'shua our Lord. For to You every knee must bow and every tongue declare that You are God, our everlasting Father.

May Your kingdom be established in our time and may we see the kingdom of David's greater son be established forever. For then shall the words be fulfilled, &quot;Yahweh shall be king forever over all the earth; and on that day Yahweh shall be one, and his name one.&quot;  Hallelujah!   (Psalm 104:1-2, Deuteronomy 4:39, Psalm 10:16, Zechariah 14:9)

The Baal Tokea (Shofar blower) then recites the following blessing:

Blessed are You, Yahweh our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with Your commandments and in the blood of Y'shua the Messiah, and commanded us to hear the sound of the shofar.

O Lord, open my lips that my mouth might declare Your matchless praise.  Blessed are You, Yahweh our God, God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; great, mighty, and revered God, Who is Lord over all;  Who has bestowed loving kindness and mercy upon us in giving us Y'shua the Messiah as our Redeemer.  Thankyou for the gift of life, and for inscribing us in the Lamb's book of life, through the sacrifice of Your Son Y'shua, the Lamb of God, Who takes away the sin of the world and who will bring back the outcasts of Israel and redeem them, for Your Holy Name's sake.

You sustain the living with kindness and revive the dead with great mercy; You support all who fall and heal the sick; You set the captives free, and will keep faith with those who sleep in the dust. 

Our God, and the God of our fathers, may this remembrance of Messiah, the son of David and Your servant, ascend and be accepted before You for deliverance and joy, for grace, kindness and mercy, for life and peace on this Day of Remembrance for Israel as it is for us. Draw Your people Israel, and all peoples, unto Yourself through Y'shua the Messiah, for You are a gracious and merciful, God and King. 	B'hem Y'shua HaMaschiach, Amein.

8.   MESSAGE  (Genesis 22: 1-19)
The sounding of the Shofar on Yom Teruah is connected back to the Akeidah in Genesis 22, where Abraham took his son Isaac to offer him as a sacrifice on Mount Moriah and was given the substitute of the ram caught in the thicket.   The horn of the ram became a symbol for the substitutionary offering which Yahweh God gave to him instead of his son.

With the sounding of Yahweh's voice on the mount, came the revelation of the Lamb of God that was to come as a substitutionary offering for all mankind in Y'shua, the Messiah.  Y'shua said that Abraham rejoiced to see His day (John 8:56), and Yahweh God received Abraham's offering as a token of his faith in the Messiah to come.   

The offering of Isaac was a type of the future crucifixion of Messiah and the oral tradition is that when the Shofar is blown, Yahweh God says that He will remember the Akeidah (the binding of Isaac) and account it as an identification with the offering of Isaac.

In other words, the sounding of the Shofar is a spiritual declaration of the victory in the crucifixion of the Messiah and it's triumph over the powers of darkness and their dominion over Adam's race. The enemy trembles at the sound of the Shofar for it pronounces his utter defeat, the day of his judgement and incarceration and his ultimate punishment.   

He gave His Word at Sinai with the sounding of the First Shofar of God, the heavenly festal shout of the inauguration of His coming kingdom on earth, through His firstborn son, Israel.  The gates of heaven were opened to receive His covenant people.  It is understood that the time Moses descended with the second set of tablets from the mount and enacted the covenant with them, was at Yom Kippur, the Day of Judgement and Atonement.

Yom Teruah, ten days before on the yearly calendar, is the call to prepare for the coming Day of Atonement when all the earth will be judged and it has been identified as the time when heaven's gates are opened for the righteous to enter in.  (Isaiah 26:2)

The righteous are said to be sealed and written in the Book of the Righteous on Yom Teruah against the judgement to come in the Tribulation.  He will confirm the covenant with them at Yom Kippur and give them the reward of their inheritance.
Those who were not accounted worthy to be written in the Book of the Righteous at Yom Teruah were given a little space to repent, &quot;Many shall be purified, made white and refined, but the wicked shall do wickedly . . . &quot;  (Daniel 12:10)

Daniel said,  &quot;there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation, even to that time.  And at that time your people shall be delivered, everyone who is found written in the book.   And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and  some to everlasting shame and contempt.&quot;    (Daniel 12: 1-2)

May we be as those who are accounted worthy to be written in the Book of the Righteous and be ready at His coming.

9.  KIDDUSH
Blessing of Kiddush  -  Leader holding cup: 
Blessed are You, Yahweh our God, King of the universe, Creator of the fruit of the vine. Amen. 

Blessed are You, Yahweh our God, King of the Universe, who has chosen us from amongst all nations and has sanctified us through the blood of Y'shua. You, O Yahweh, has graciously given us this day of remembrance, a day for the sounding of the shofar, a Holy Festival in remembrance of our departure from Egypt and as a type and shadow of our departure from this earth when we are gathered together unto Y'shua  in the clouds. Blessed art You, Yahweh our God, King of the Universe, who sanctifies the Festival of Trumpets. 

Blessing of Challah   -  Leader holding bread:
Blessed are You, Yahweh our God, King of the universe, Who brings forth bread from the earth. Amen. (take extra portion for Tashlick ceremony)

May we be inscribed for a good year as those who are trusting in Y'shua the Messiah for eternal life.

10.  TASHLICK CEREMONY
Leader:  The House of Judah has a tradition where they go to a body of water and cast their sins by faith into the sea of His forgetfulness.  For this part of the service we take a piece of the challah as a symbol of the body of Y'shua who was crucified for our sins and by means of which we have received the atonement.  We cast it in the water to represent the things which we have brought before the Father and for which we have received His forgiveness.  Just as He bore our sins in His body on the tree, so we now exercise our faith and see our sins placed upon this representation of His body and our iniquity being laid upon Him.  Having received His atonement, we now cast these things away from us never more to be remembered.

&quot;Surely He has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; Yet we esteemed Him stricken, smitten of God and afflicted.  But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; and the chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray and He has laid upon him the iniquity of us all.&quot;  Isaiah 53:4-6
(Cast in the token symbol)

&quot;For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is His mercy to those who fear Him;  As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us.&quot;   
 
&quot;Bless Yahweh, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless His holy name!  Bless Yahweh, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits:  Who forgives all your iniquities, who heals all your diseases, Who redeems your life from destruction,  Who crowns you with loving-kindness and tender mercies, Who satisfies your mouth with good things, so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's.  Bless Yahweh, O my soul!&quot;   (Psalm 103:11-12; 1-5)

11.   CLOSING PRAYER AND BENEDICTION
We bless you Yahweh our Mighty God, and hope soon to behold Your majestic glory when all abominations shall be removed and all iniquity shall end and we shall shelter under the rule of Your righteous kingdom, when all mankind shall bow the knee and every tongue shall declare that You are God.

Let Your kingdom come and may the kingdom of David's greater son be established forever.  For then shall the words be fulfilled, &quot;the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of Yahweh God and of His Messiah, and He shall reign for ever and ever,  Amen!&quot;    (Revelation 11:15)

May the love of Yahweh God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all, both now and forever more, Amen.



The morning service can conclude with a communal Festive meal.  Even though the day has it's solemn overtones, it is a time of rejoicing in God's mercy and sins forgiven and looking forward to a year of blessing from his loving Hands.

The days which follow between Yom Teruah and Yom Kippur are called the &quot;Days of Awe&quot; when the final accounting of one's life for the past year is taken and brought before Yahweh God to seek complete reconciliation and holiness before Him.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Yom Kippur is the most awesome day in the sacred calendar when each individual seeks to come into the throne room of Almighty God and appropriate the work of Messiah's atonement by confession, repentance and restitution before a holy God.  It is the only commanded fast in scripture and starts before the day of Yom Kippur officially begins, traditionally commencing one hour before nightfall on the 9th Tishri, making it a 25 hour fast by the end of the day at nightfall on the 10th Tishri.

It has become a custom to spiritually prepare for this intense period of seeking the face of Yahweh God by having a festive meal in the afternoon of the 9th Tishri in anticipation of the blessing of sins forgiven which will be extended to those who sincerely repent of all sin and also to fortify oneself physically for the day ahead.   This is done as an act of faith in Yahweh's mercy.

As part of the consecration, the emblems of the bread and wine may be taken in remembrance of Y'shua's atonement for us in which we place our faith.

A Mikveh (ritual immersion in water - i.e. baptism) is also usually taken and white garments are worn symbolically as part of the ceremonial ritual of purification of one's life.

In lieu of the temple services, the Jews now have five services on Yom Kippur in the synagogue.   The first at night at the commencement of Yom Kippur.  The second is the morning service and an additional service is added in the morning called the Musaf, then the afternoon service is followed by the final service of the day, the Ne'ilah She'arim  (the closing of the gates).

YOM KIPPUR EVE SERVICE
For the afternoon of the eve of Yom Kippur following the festive meal, normally eaten approx. 3pm.

1. BLESSING OF THE FESTIVAL LIGHTS

Blessed are You, Yahweh our God, King of the universe, Who has kept us in life, and preserved us, and enabled us to reach this time. 

May we follow the instruction of Y'shua haMashiach, Who said,  Again you have heard that it has been said to those of old,  You shall not swear falsely, but shall fulfill your vows to Yahweh .  But I say to you, do not swear at all; neither by heaven, for it is God s throne; nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. Nor shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black. But let your  Yes  be  Yes  and your  No   No , For whatever is more than these is from the evil one.  (Matthew 5:33-37)

4. PRAYERS
O Yahweh our God and God of our fathers, we acknowledge to You that we are sinners.  We have acted unfaithfully, aggressively and slanderously;  We have acted brazenly, viciously and fraudulently; We have acted willfully, scornfully and obstinately;  We have acted perniciously, disdainfully and erratically. Turning away from Your good precepts and laws has not profited us.   You are just in all that has come upon us; You have dealt truthfully, but we have acted wickedly. 

O, You Who dwells on high, what can we say to You? 
You are in heaven, what can we declare in Your presence? You know what is open and what is hidden. You know the mysteries of the universe and the dark secrets of every living soul. You search all the inmost chambers of man's conscience; nothing escapes You, nothing is hidden from Your sight. 

We thank You Lord that You hast provided atonement for all our transgressions through the sacrifice of Y'shua haMashiach, our Salvation.   {Specific listing of sins and/or private confession) 

We thank You for Your atonement, O God of forgiveness.  Forgive us for the mortal sins for which the early courts would inflict the death penalty.  (1 John 5:14-17)   Forgive us the breach of positive commands and the breach of negative commands, whether or not they involve an act, whether or not they are known to us.
The sins known to us we have already acknowledged to You; and those that are not known to us are indeed well-known to You, as it is said:  What is hidden belongs to the Lord God, but what is known concerns us and our children forever, that we may observe all the commands of this Torah.  

You are the Forgiver of Israel, our Pardoner in every generation, and besides You we have no King to pardon and forgive our sins.  O Yahweh, open my lips that my mouth might declare Your praise.Blessed are You, O Yahweh our God,  God of our fathers; God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; 
Great, Mighty and Revered God, Who bestows loving kindness, and are Master of all things, Who hast graciously brought the Redeemer, Y'shua haMashiach, to provide our atonement; and will graciously save Israel for Your Holy Names sake. 

We thank You for life, O King Who delights in life; we thank You for inscribing us in the Lamb s Book of Life, for the sake of Y'shua the Lamb of God, Who takes away our sins. 
Our God and God of our fathers, may the remembrance of Messiah the Son of David Your servant ascend and come and be accepted before You for deliverance and happiness, for grace, kindness and mercy, for life and peace on this Day of Atonement. Remember us this day,  O Yahweh our God, and be mindful of us for blessing.

SCRIPTURE READING  Numbers 29: 7-11;  Hebrews 9:23; 10: 6-10


CONFESSION AND RECONCILIATION
Consider the magnitude of God's forgiveness of our sins which are worthy of death by the provision of His own Son to die in our place. If God forgave us then we ought to forgive one another.

Y'shua taught -   &quot;For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.  But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.&quot; Matthew 6:14-15

&quot;Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on tender mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering, bearing with one another and forgiving one another, if anyone has a complaint against another, even as Messiah forgave you, so you must do.&quot;   Colossians 3:13-14

Y'shua said in Matthew 18:15, &quot;Moreover if your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone.  If he hears you, you have gained your brother.&quot;  (And continuing on in verses 16-20 the procedure to follow and the principles involved in loosing others sins and effecting reconciliation).
Reconciliation of any offences or differences within the family unit should be given priority and ideally be settled before issues within the extended family of God.  Children are blessed.  Parents place their hands on their child's head and say: 
To sons: Y sim kha elohim k ephra yim v khim nashe. May God make you as Ephraim and Menashe. 
To daughters: Ysim meikh elohim k sara, rivka, raheIl v leah. May God make you as Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, &amp; Leah.


PRAYER
Our Father, our King, be gracious to us and answer us though we have no merits; deal graciously with us and deliver us


PRIESTLY BLESSING 
Yahweh bless you and keep you.  Yahweh make His face to shine upon you and be gracious unto you.  Yahweh lift up His countenance upon you and give you peace.  In the name of the Prince of Peace, Yeshua the Messiah. Amen.


KOL NIDREI (Aram.  “All vows”)
A declaration of annulment of vows with which the evening service of the Day of Atonement in the synagogue commences. The worshipers proclaim that all personal vows, oaths, etc., that they made unwittingly, rashly, or unknowingly (and that, consequently, cannot be fulfilled) during the year should be considered null and void. 

Reader:  &quot;When you make a vow to Yahweh your God, you shall not delay to pay it; for Yahweh your God shall surely require it of you, and it would be sin to you.  That which has gone out of your lips you shall keep and perform, for you voluntarily vowed to Yahweh your God what you have promised with your mouth.&quot;  Deuteronomy 23:21, 23

&quot;All vows, oaths, promises, obligations, which I (we) have purposed, vowed, promised, sworn, or bound myself (ourselves) to fulfill in the past year, we repent of.   We ask You to forgive us of our negligence, forgetfulness and inability to keep that which proceeded from our mouths.  Release us from that which we vowed and let the bonds be broken and our words made null and void,  annihilated and abolished.  Teach us to weigh our words and put a  guard on our mouths before we utter foolishly that which we are unable to perform and fulfill.  You are gracious and compassionate, full of mercy and forgiveness and we thank You for your atonement in Y'shua our Messiah&quot;

SONG  Psalm 145        

MESSAGE
Atonement has two basic components: forgiveness, which is preceded by repentance, and purification, which is symbolized by baptism. The first goat, on which the lot for Azazel fell (the scapegoat), representatively carried the people s sins far away into the wilderness, too far for them to return. It typifies forgiveness in Y'shua... Acts 5:30-31 

The God of our fathers raised up Y'shua,... to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us.  Psalm 103:9

The second goat, on which the lot for Yahweh fell, became an elevation offering through burning, going up as a sweet savour to God.  It represents purification through Y'shua - being born anew and clothed with light,... For as many of you as have been baptized into Messiah have put on Messiah.  Galatians 3:27 

Another perspective of atonement, is that God covers our sins, and then covers us with a robe of righteousness.
Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.     Romans 4:7 

Lo, a great multitude... clothed with robes of light. Revelation 7:9 

We are commanded to repent and then to learn to walk in righteousness. It is the goodness of God that leads us to repentance, and only through His Spirit that we can walk before Him in righteousness; there is no merit to be naturally found in us.

By definition, sin is that which is contrary to God's instruction and opposite to actions showing faith in God.   Repentance means returning - to God.  It is shown when one who has transgressed is faced with the opportunity to repeat the sin and he has the power to do so, yet he refrains - neither because of fear nor because of weakness - but because he wishes to turn to God.  
      
A sinner should abandon his sinfulness, drive it from his thoughts and conclude in his heart that he will never do it again. Additionally, he should regret the past and he must confess with his lips and declare those things that he has concluded in his heart. For sins committed against a fellow man, restitution must (as far as possible) first be made. The Yom Kippur atonement is an annual rehearsal to remind us to turn and serve our Saviour with all our heart, with all our soul, and with all our might!

CONFESSION  Viduy (sins are addressed corporately as being responsible for each other's sins)

Leader:   Our God and the God of our forefathers, may our prayer come before You. Do not ignore our supplication, for we are not so brazen and obstinate as to say before You, Yahweh our God and the God of our forefathers, that we are righteous and have not sinned - rather, we and our forefathers have sinned. We have become guilty, we have betrayed, we have robbed, we have spoken slander. We have caused perversion, we have caused wickedness, we have sinned willfully, we have extorted, we have accused falsely. We have counseled evil, we have been deceitful, we have scorned, we have rebelled, we have provoked, we have turned away, we have been perverse, we have acted wantonly, we have persecuted, we have been obstinate. 

We have been wicked, we have corrupted, we have been abominable, we have strayed and You allowed us to go our own way. 
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws but to no avail.  But You are righteous in all that has come upon us, for You have acted truthfully while we have caused wickedness. 

What can we say before You, Who dwells on high, and what can we relate to You, Who abides in the highest heavens for indeed, everything that is hidden and revealed You know. You know the secrets of the universe, and the hidden-most mysteries of all the living. You probe all innermost chambers and test thoughts and emotions.  Nothing is hidden from You and nothing is concealed from Your eyes. And so may it be Your will, Yahweh our God and the God of our forefathers, that You atone for us for all our errors, and You forgive us for all our iniquities, and You pardon us for all our willful sins.

Congregation:   For the sin that we have sinned before You under duress and willingly; and for the sin that we have sinned before You through hardness of the heart.  For the sin that we have sinned before You without knowledge and in ignorance and for the sin that we have sinned before You willfully and carelessly. For the sin that we have sinned before You with knowledge and with deceit; and for the sin that we have sinned before You against those who know and against those who do not know. 

For all these, O God of forgiveness, forgive us and pardon us through Y'shua's atonement for us.

For the sin that we have sinned before You through immorality; and for the sin that we have sinned before You in public or in private. For the sin that we have sinned before You through wronging a neighbor; and for the sin that we have sinned before You through inner thoughts.  For the sin that we have sinned before You in a session of vice; and for the sin that we have sinned before You through insincere confession and for the sin that we have sinned before You with the utterance of the lips and for the sin that we have sinned before You through harsh speech.  

For the sin that we have sinned before You through impure lips; and for the sin that we have sinned before You through foolish speech. For the sin that we have sinned before You through scorning; and for the sin that we have sinned before You through evil talk. For the sin that we have sinned before You with the idle chatter of our lips; and for the sin that we have sinned before You by gossip-mongering. 

For all these, O God of forgiveness, forgive us and pardon us through Y'shua s atonement for us. 

For the sin that we have sinned before You by showing contempt for parents and teachers; For the sin that we have sinned before You in throwing off Your yoke; and for the sin that we have sinned before You in judgment. For the sin that we have sinned before You by exercising controlling powers; and for the sin that we have sinned before You through desecration of the Name. For the sin that we have sinned before You with the Evil Inclination; For the sin that we have sinned before You through denial and false promises; and for the sin that we have sinned before You by subservience through bribery.  For the sin that we have sinned before You in commercial dealings; and for the sin that we have sinned before You with food and drink.  

For the sin that we have sinned before You through interest and extortion; and for the sin that we have sinned before You through haughtiness. and for the sin that we have sinned before You with prying eyes. For the sin that we have sinned before You with haughty eyes; and for the sin that we have sinned before You with brazenness. 

For the sin that we have sinned before You through a begrudging eye, and for the sin that we have sinned before You with obstinacy. For the sin that we have sinned before You with legs that run to do evil; For the sin that we have sinned before You through vain oath-taking; and for the sin that we have sinned before You through baseless hatred. For the sin that we have sinned before You in the matter of extending a hand; and for the sin that we have sinned before You through confusion of the heart. 

For all these, O God of forgiveness, forgive us and pardon us through Y'shua's atonement for us.

Those that are revealed to us we have declared before You and confessed them to You; and those that are not revealed to us are revealed and known to You. You are the Forgiver and the Pardoner in every generation, and beside You there is none to forgive. Behold, before You I am like a vessel filled with shame and humiliation. May it be Your will, Yahweh my God and the God of my forefathers, that I not sin again. And what I have sinned before You, may You wipe away with Your abundant mercy that I not be judged through suffering or serious illness. 
My God, guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking deceitfully. To those who curse me, let my soul be silent; and let my soul be like dust to everyone. 
Open my heart to Your Torah, then my soul will pursue Your commandments. 
As for all those who oppose me and design evil against me, speedily nullify their counsel and disrupt their design. 

May it be Your will, Yahweh my God and the God of my forefathers, that human jealousy may not rise up against me, nor my jealousy upon others; may I not become angry today, and may I not anger You. Rescue me from the Evil Inclination, and place in my heart submissiveness and humility. 

Leader:  May the expressions of our mouths and the thoughts of our hearts be acceptable before You, Yahweh our Rock and our Redeemer.  May the peace of God be ours and for all Israel. Amen.


BAPTISM Mikvah 
Baptism is a rite representing a change of state from ritual uncleanness to spiritual purity as a result of repentance.  (1 Peter 3:21)
Psalm 24:3-61 Who may ascend into the hill of Yahweh? And who may stand in His holy place? He who has clean hands and a pure heart. Who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood, and has not sworn deceitfully. He shall receive a blessing from Yahweh and righteousness from the God of his salvation. This is the generation of those who seek Him, who seek Thy face even Jacob. Selah.           
Without holiness no man shall see the Lord.        


ALEINU   (excerpts)
Leader: It is Incumbent upon us us... ... Please stand 
All: It is incumbent upon us to praise the Master of all, to exalt the creator of the world. We bow in awe and thanksgiving before the One Who is sovereign over all, the Holy One, blessed be He. He stretched forth the heavens like a tent and established the earth as His footstool. Truly there is none like our Lord and King. 

We anticipate, Yahweh our God, to soon behold Your majestic glory when all abominations shall be removed and all false gods shall be at an end. Then shall the world be perfected under Your authority and all mankind shall call upon Your name. For to You every knee must bow and every tongue declare that You are God.  Reign over us soon and forever. 

May the kingdom of David s greater son, Y'shua, be established forever. For then shall the words be fulfilled,        
Yahweh shall be king forever, and, Yahweh shall be king over all the earth.        
On that day, Yahweh shall be One, and His Name One. Amen


PRIESTLY BLESSING Birkhat Khohanim 
Leader: Yahweh bless you and keep you; Yahweh make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you; Yahweh lift up His countenance upon you and give you peace. 
Congregation: Amen.


FINAL GREETING   G' mar Hatimah Tovah        
May you have a good &amp; final sealing in the book of life
If there are no facilities for an immersion in a Mikveh to be undertaken in the service, it can be done afterward.



MUSAF MORNING SERVICE
This service was added to the Synagogues services to replace the Temple service after 70AD

Leader:  Sh'ma Israel, Yahweh is our God, Yahweh is One.  Blessed be the Name of the glory of His Sovereignty for evermore!

Congregation  &quot;And you shall love Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul and with all your might. And these words which I command you this day, shall be engraved on your heart. And you shall teach them diligently to your children, and speak of them when you sit in your house, and when you go out on the way, and when you lie down and when you rise up. And you shall bind them for a token upon your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.  And you shall write them upon your door-posts of your house and upon your gates.&quot;   Deuteronomy 6: 4-9

Leader:  With great abounding love You have loved us, Yahweh our God!  With great and exuberant mercy You have had compassion upon us, our Father, our King!  
All compassionate Father, have mercy upon us and implant in our hearts the faculty to understand and clearly conceive, to hear, to learn and to teach, to observe and to carry out all the teachings of Your law in love for You.   Enlighten our eyes in Your Torah and cause our hearts to cleave unto Your commandments; unite our hearts to love and to reverence Your name so that we would not be put to shame.  For in Your holy Name we confide, and rejoice in Your salvation to come.

&quot;This is the message that we have from Him and declare unto you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth.  
But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Y'shua the Messiah His Son cleanses us from all sin.  If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.  
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;  1 John 1: 5-9


PRAYER - Messianic Ashamnu 
Leader:  O Yahweh our God and God of our fathers, we acknowledge to You that we are sinners.  We have acted unfaithfully, we have neglected our responsibilities and have been selfish.  We have been lukewarm and not loved You with all our heart and mind and hungered and thirsted after Your righteousness and the things of Your kingdom.

We have elevated other people and other things above our commitment to obey You. We have not loved our neighbours as ourselves, and have fallen short in not blessing our enemies and turning the other cheek. 

We have not been merciful and have withheld what we could have given.  We have not gone the second mile and have been impatient with the faults of others.  We have judged, we have held resentments and have not been quick to forgive.
We have not been our brothers keeper and done unto others as we would have had them do unto us.

We have been greedy and we have loved the world and the things in the world.  We have been anxious and not trusted You to provide for all of our needs. We have set our minds on the things of earth and not on the things above.We have given our time and our energies to things that do not profit and practiced our righteousness before men.

We have not abstained from the lusts of our flesh and honoured our bodies as Your holy dwelling place. We have been negligent in prayer and have not been thankful and rejoiced in the situations of our lives.

We have spoken critically, we have slandered, we have gossipped and engaged in evil talk about our brother. We have not controlled our tongues and only spoken that which we know to be true and of good report. 
We have been proud and obstinate, unwilling to have a teachable spirit and be corrected.

We have had evil thoughts and evil desires to fulfill the lusts of our hearts.
We have sinned wilfully against You; and we have sinned in negligence of Your holy precepts and Your statutes.

We have turned away from Your good precepts and laws and gone our own way to fulfill the desires of our own heart and mind. We have neglected to keep our lives filled with Your holy Spirit and walk as Y'shua walked.

Congregation:  You know the secrets of every living soul. You search all the inmost chambers of man's conscience; nothing escapes You, and nothing is hidden from Your sight.  
Search my heart, O God, and know my heart; try me and know my anxieties; and see if there is any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting, for Your Name's sake, Amen   (Psalm 139:23-24)

We thank You our Father that You hast provided atonement for all our transgressions through the sacrifice of Y'shua haMashiach, our Redeemer.  


Time for reflection and private meditation

THE AVODAH   Leviticus 16: 3-9; 15-34 (traditionally divided between six readers)
First Reader: Preparation by the High Priest: Yom Kippur was the only day the High Priest would enter the Holy of Holies in the Temple, and the only time during the year he would recite the explicit name of God, Yahweh. 
 
In order to perform these rites, he would begin his preparation seven days ahead of time, perfecting his performance of the rituals in accordance with the books of Leviticus and Numbers. At dawn he would begin the Avodah service.

Read  Leviticus Chapter 16 - vs. 3-6

Second Reader:  First confession, for the High Priest and his household:  The High Priest would begin Yom Kippur with ritual immersion, change his clothes, and then make a sacrifice for the regular daily offering.  He would then immerse himself again and don white linen clothing that was used only while making the Yom Kippur sacrifices.  He then would approach the bull he was to use for his personal sacrifice (for himself and his family) and make the confession --
“I beseech You, O God, to forgive the iniquities and the transgressions and the sins which I have committed against You, I and my household.... ”,  ending by pronouncing the explicit name of God, &quot;Yahweh&quot;.  

The High Priest would prolong his pronunciation of the name until the people finished saying, ... ...

Congregation:  (kneeling and prostrating themselves before the Divine Presence) 
&quot;We bend the knee and prostrate ourselves and offer thanks to the supreme King of Kings, the Holy One, blessed be he, who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth, whose glorious throne is in the heavens and the home of whose majesty is in the loftiest heights.&quot; 
“Blessed be Yahweh’s glorious sovereignty forever.”

Leader:  The High Priest would then say:   “You are purified.” 
&quot;So shall they put My Name upon the children of Israel and I will bless them&quot;  Numbers 6:27

Reader  -  Lev.16:9, 11

Third Reader:  Second confession, for all priests:
Next the High Priest would approach the two goats that had been prepared for sacrifice for the people. He would pull from an urn the two lots, one marked “Yahweh” and one marked “Le Azazel” (for the wilderness). He would tie a strip of red cloth on the horns of the goat for the wilderness, and a strip of red cloth on the neck of the goat to be sacrificed.

The High Priest then made confession for all the priests (“I beseech You, O God, to forgive the iniquities and the transgressions and the sins which I have committed against You, I and my household and the children of Aaron, Your holy people....”). 

He ended, again, by pronouncing the name of Yahweh, the people would again prostrate themselves on the ground, calling: Congregation:  (prostrated)  &quot;We bend the knee and prostrate ourselves and offer thanks to the supreme king of kings, the holy one, blessed be he, who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth, whose glorious throne is in the heavens and the home of whose majesty is in the loftiest heights.&quot; 

Blessed be Yahweh's glorious sovereignty forever

Leader:  and the High Priest absolved them by saying,  “You are purified.” 

Reader:  Lev.16:12-14

Fourth Reader:  Entering the Holy of Holies: After the second confession over the bull, the High Priest slaughtered it and gathered its blood into a bowl. He then took a fire pan and ladle and carried these into the Holy of Holies.

Reaching the ark he threw two handfuls of incense into the fire pan, filling the entire chamber with smoke. He then went back outside and took the bowl of the bull’s blood. Returning inside he sprinkled it eight times, one time upward and seven times downward.  He went back out into the Temple Court and slaughtered the goat marked “Yahweh.” Returning to the Holy of Holies, he sprinkled its blood eight times, precisely as he had done that of the bull: one time upward and seven times downward.   Read  Lev.16:15-17

Fifth Reader:  Third confession, for the House of Israel: The High Priest then returned to the Temple Court, approaching the goat marked “Le Azazel.”   He laid his hands upon it and confessed for the entire people of Israel (“I beseech You, O God, to forgive the iniquities and the transgressions and the sins which Your people the House of Israel have committed against You..”). Leader:  I invoke the name of Y-a-h-w-e-h upon you

Congregation:  &quot;We bend the knee and prostrate ourselves and offer thanks to the supreme king of kings, the holy one, blessed be he who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth, whose glorious throne is in the heavens and the home of whose majesty is in the loftiest heights.&quot; 

Blessed be Yahweh's glorious Sovereignty forever

Leader:  and the High Priest absolved them by saying, “You are purified.” 

Reader:  Lev.16:18-19

Sixth Reader:  The goat for the wilderness: After this third confession, the goat Le Azazel was taken by a priest to a designated ravine in the wilderness. The priest took off the crimson thread, tying one half to a rock and the other half back on to the goat’s horns. Then he pushed the goat into the ravine. 
 
Sentinels posted along the route from the ravine signaled back to the waiting people that the goat had reached the wilderness, at which time the High Priest read from Leviticus and Numbers and recited concluding benedictions.  If the atonement was accepted, the scarlet thread which was tied to the goat turned white and the High Priest was accompanied by the people back to his house with great joy and song, for he had emerged safely from the Holy of Holies and the people were cleansed of their sin.

&quot;If your sins should be like the scarlet thread, they will turn like snow.  Isaiah  1:18

Read:  Lev.16:20-22; and,
&quot;This shall be a statute for you forever:  In the seventh month on the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, whether a native of your own country or a stranger who dwells among you.  For on that day the priest shall make atonement for you, to cleanse you that you may be clean from all your sins before Yahweh.  It is a Sabbath of solemn rest for you, and you shall afflict your souls.  It is a statute forever.&quot;  Leviticus 16:29-31

&quot;But now Messiah has come, as the High Priest of all the blessings which were to come.  He has passed through the greater the more perfect tent, not made by human hands, that is, not of this created order; and he has entered the sanctuary once for all, taking with him not the blood of goats and bull calves, but his own blood, having won an eternal redemption.&quot;  

&quot;He entered into heaven itself, so that he now appears in the presence of God on our behalf. &quot;  Hebrews 9:11-12, 24

AVODAH LITURGICAL POEM
How majestic was the High Priest as he left the Holy of Holies; In peace and without injury.
Like the heavenly canopy stretched over those who dwell above;
Like lightning bolts Emanating from the radiance of the heavenly beings...;
Like the sight of sunlight upon the earth;  Like the garden's rose among the thorns;
Like the appearance of constellations from the south.
[Such] was the appearance of the [High] Priest.

&quot;And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead.  But He laid His right hand on me, saying to me, Do not be afraid; I am the First and the Last.  I am He who lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore.  Amen.&quot;  Revelation 1:17-18 

&quot;We have then, brothers, complete confidence through the blood of Y'shua in entering the sanctuary, by a new way which he has opened up for us, a living opening through the curtain, that is to say, his flesh.  And we have the high priest over all the sanctuary of God.  So as we go in. let us be sincere in heart and filled with faith, our hearts sprinkled and free from any trace of bad conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.  Let us keep firm in the hope we profess, because the one who made the promise is trustworthy.&quot;  Hebrews 10:19-23 NJB

Leader:  He is able to save to the uttermost all that come unto God through Him.   (Hebrews 7:25)

“Beloved, keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord, Yeshua the Messiah unto eternal life”  (Jude 21)

PRIESTLY BLESSING
“Yahweh bless you and keep you. Yahweh make His face shine upon you, and be gracious unto you; Yahweh lift up His countenance upon you and give you peace. “  Amen! (Numbers 6:25)



MINCHAH AND NEILAH SERVICES

Yom Kippur, is the appointed time that Yahweh our God has chosen to deal with issues of sin that have not been resolved in our lives  in our preparation to stand before the presence of His glory in that Day with joy, and not with shame.
This day is a revelation of His compassionate love and His great mercy toward us, His people, in His provision of atonement in Y'shua, our Messiah.  It is a day to commemorate that sacrificial provision and to respond by changing, turning and making Teshuvah/repentance.  He has done it all to set us free from the bondage of our sin. 
Yom Kippur can be the beginning of a renewed relationship with our God.   It is a window of opportunity to grow closer to Y'shua through repentance and cleansing.  When we respond appropriately, we receive the atonement He provided and ensure that our destiny is secured for another year and our names continue to be written in the Lamb's Book of Life.

Maranatha!  Until He comes!




The Minchah is the afternoon service and the Neilah is the closing service of the day in the Synagogue which have been combined here.
Neilah, literally means &quot;closing&quot; or &quot;shutting,&quot; because it originally coincided with the time of the shutting of the Temple’s gates. 
In time Neilah came to mean the closing of the gates of heaven which stood ajar during the day to receive the prayers and supplications of the contrite and repentant sinners. Ephesians 4:30

__TOC__

==What is Kerberos?==
[[w:Kerberos|Kerberos]] is a Software developed at the [[w:MIT|MIT]] which can be used for network authentication. It uses a trusted third party (which we will call [[w:Key_distribution_center|key distribution center]] or KDC) in case two entities are trying to communicate safely. That third party consists of an authentication server one one side and on the other side of a Ticket Granting Server. For each entity the third party knows the secret key. In case two entities try secret communication the [[w:Key_distribution_center|key distribution center]] the KDC generates a session key.

The tickets you get from the KDC, specifically the AFS tokens you can make from those tickets will be the passport in the AFS network.

==Where to get?==
===Installing packages provided by your distribution===
Most distributions provide an OpenAFS/Kerberos environment themselves. For Gentoo an ebuild is provided. In case you are using Slackware64 you may get packages from http://ossy86.bplaced.net/dev/afskrb/

===Building it from source===
You can download Kerberos packages from http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/ or download a current development release via

 svn co svn://anonsvn.mit.edu/krb5/trunk/ .

into the your current working directory.

After you have got the sources we will do a
 
 util/reconf

in order to update the necessary configuration files. After we have done that we tell the build system to compile modules we are relying on via

 ./configure \
  --prefix=/usr \
  --enable-dns-for-realm \
  --enable-athena \
  --enable-kdc-replay-cache \
  --with-ldap \
  --libdir=/usr/lib64

The following table describes necessary options.
{| class=&quot;prettytable&quot; 
! style=&quot;background:#FFDEAD;&quot; colspan=7 | Description of configuration parameters
|-
! style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot; | Switch
! style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot; | Description
|-
| align = &quot;center&quot; | --prefix=/usr
| align = &quot;center&quot; | We are going to install Kerberos into the directory /usr
|-
| align = &quot;center&quot; | --enable-dns-for-realm
| align = &quot;center&quot; | If this option is enabled we can use the Domain Name System for finding Kerberos Servers
|-
| align = &quot;center&quot; | --enable-athena
| align = &quot;center&quot; | Enable if you wish support for athena-like systems (distributed administration of thin clients and/or small computers with training software)
|-
| align = &quot;center&quot; | --enable-kdc-replay-cache
| align = &quot;center&quot; | Enable detection of retransmitted and/or replayed requests to the [[w:Key_distribution_center|key distribution center]]
|-
| align = &quot;center&quot; | --with-ldap
| align = &quot;center&quot; | Enable the [[w:LDAP|LDAP]] Backend
|-
| align = &quot;center&quot; | --libdir=/usr/lib64
| align = &quot;center&quot; | We would like to install libraries into this directory in case we are running on a x86_64 machine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Russian Civil War (1917–1923) was a multi-party war that occurred within the former Russian Empire after the Russian provisional government collapsed and the Soviets under the domination of the Bolshevik party assumed power, first in Petrograd (St. Petersburg) and then in other places.

Following the abdication of Nicholas II of Russia and the turbulent Russian Revolution throughout 1917, the Russian Provisional Government was established. In October another revolution occurred in which the Red Guard, armed groups of workers and deserting soldiers directed by the Bolshevik Party, seized control of Saint Petersburg (then known as Petrograd) and began an immediate armed takeover of cities and villages throughout the former Russian Empire. 

The Bolsheviks decided to immediately make peace with the German Empire and the Central Powers, as they had promised the Russian people prior to the Revolution.

In January 1918, after significant reverses in combat, War Commissar Leon Trotsky headed the reorganization of the Red Guard into a Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, in order to create a more professional fighting force. Political commissars were appointed to each unit of the army to maintain morale and ensure loyalty. 

While resistance to the Red Guard began on the very next day after the Bolshevik uprising, the Brest-Litovsk treaty and the political ban became a catalyst for the formation of anti-Bolshevik groups both inside and outside Russia, pushing them into action against the new regime.

A loose confederation of anti-Bolshevik forces aligned against the Communist government, including land-owners, republicans, conservatives, middle-class citizens, reactionaries, pro-monarchists, liberals, army generals, non-Bolshevik socialists who still had grievances and democratic reformists, voluntarily united only in their opposition to Bolshevik rule. Their military forces, bolstered by foreign influence and led by General Yudenich, Admiral Kolchak and General Denikin, became known as the White movement (sometimes referred to as the &quot;White Army&quot;), and they controlled significant parts of the former Russian empire for most of the war.

The majority of the fighting ended in 1920 with the defeat of General Pyotr Wrangel (of the Whites) in the Crimea, but a notable resistance in certain areas continued until 1923 (e.g, Kronstadt Uprising, Tambov Rebellion, Basmachi Revolt, and the final resistance of the White movement in the Far East).

'''Asenapine''' ('''Saphris''') is a new [[atypical antipsychotic]] developed for the treatment of [[schizophrenia]] and acute mania associated with [[bipolar disorder]] by [[Schering-Plough]] after its [[November 19]], [[2007]] merge with  [[Organon International]]. Development of the drug, through [[Phase III]] trials, began while Organon was still a part of [[Akzo Nobel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GEN200706&quot;&gt;{{cite news
 | title = Bipolar Disorder | work = Clinical Trials Update
 | publisher = Genetic Engineering &amp; Biotechnology News | pages = 52,55 | date = 2007-06-15 | accessdate = 2007-12-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary data indicate that it has minimal anticholinergic and cardiovascular side effects, as well as minimal weight gain. Over 3000 patients have participated in [[clinical trial]]s of asenapine, and the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] accepted the manufacturer's [[New Drug Application|NDA]] on [[November 26]], [[2007]] for standard review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

==Pharmacology==
Asenapine shows high [[affinity]] (pKi) for numerous [[receptor]]s, including the [[serotonin]] [[5-HT1A|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;]] (8.6), [[5-HT1B|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1B&lt;/sub&gt;]] (8.4), [[5-HT2A|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;]] (10.2), [[5-HT2B_receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B&lt;/sub&gt;]] (9.8), [[5-HT2C|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2C&lt;/sub&gt;]] (10.5), [[5-HT5A|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;5A&lt;/sub&gt;]] (8.8), [[5-HT6|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] (9.5), and [[5-HT7|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]] (9.9) receptors, the [[adrenaline|adrenergic]] [[Alpha-1_adrenergic_receptor|α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] (8.9), [[Alpha-2A_adrenergic_receptor|α&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;]] (8.9), [[Alpha-2B_adrenergic_receptor|α&lt;sub&gt;2B&lt;/sub&gt;]] (9.5), and [[Alpha-2C_adrenergic_receptor|α&lt;sub&gt;2C&lt;/sub&gt;]] (8.9) receptors, the [[dopamine]] [[Dopamine_receptor_D1|D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] (8.9), [[Dopamine_receptor_D2|D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] (8.9), [[Dopamine_receptor_D3|D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] (9.4), and [[Dopamine_receptor_D4|D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] (9.0) receptors, and the [[histamine]] [[Histamine_H1_receptor|H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] (9.0) and [[Histamine_H2_receptor|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] (8.2) receptors.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18308814&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shahid M, Walker GB, Zorn SH, Wong EH. | title = Asenapine: a novel psychopharmacologic agent with a unique human receptor signature. | journal = J Psychopharmacol. | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 65-73 | year = 2009 | pmid = 18308814 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has much lower affinity (pKi &lt; 5) for the [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor]]s.

== Motto ==
I truly believe that you got it right. With the increasing level of complexity/abstraction everything today has, some of the basic knowledge is being lost and requiring people to become increasingly specialized and indeed dumb.  Since without a good foundation all higher knowledge can't be fully effective or completely understood.  Leading to an increasingly spread of the application of the [[w:Cargo cult|cargo cult]] mentality to science, people do as they were said it had to be done not as they think is best, this also reduces the ability for critical analysis.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:54, 3 December 2009 (UTC)

I expect this is a repost of previously deleted material at [[Real Book Errata]].  On the other hand it is not clear to me how this differs from other errata's we have.  Perhaps someone with the ability can check to see if this is the same as what was deleted before. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:31, 20 July 2009 (UTC)
:It's not a repost of the material at [[Real Book Errata]].  It lists additional songs in addition to those that were in the other book.  You'd have to point me to other Erratas on Wikibooks, as I currently fail to see the use of this book. What does a list of books teach? These are supposed to be textbooks. This kind of thing belongs elsewhere. I say [[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete'''. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:06, 20 July 2009 (UTC)

:The Real Books are among the standard texts for teaching the repertoire of American jazz music.  These books are used in jazzs education programs in colleges and conservatories (indeed, the first Real Book Eds 1-5 were created at Berklee for that very purpose).  It would be fair to say, however, that this is not an &quot;errata&quot; page per se but a page of differences between the two standard versions of the Real Books in most common use; the entry should arguably be retitled as such.  As Adrignola points out, this is not a repost of earlier material but was generated by me from the source material independent of whatever was originally posted.  Indeed, this was originally posted on Wikipedia but was deleted there as being something that belonged on Wikibooks, hence its posting here.  As the author I will not vote for or against deletion, since my opinion is biased.--[[User:Cunamara|Cunamara]] ([[User talk:Cunamara|talk]]) 14:16, 20 July 2009 (UTC)
:{{keep}} but retitle. As described by [[User:Cunamara|Cunamara]] these seem to fit as a textbook, and if he is going to develop them in that direction, I do think this seems to fit better here than elsewhere. Caveat: we'd expect some work on the actual meaning of the differences, rather than just a list of what the differences were. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:00, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

: [[Image:Symbol neutral vote.svg|15px]] '''Merge'''. This page is related to an actual textbook used in colleges to teach jazz. I suggest moving this page into the [[Music Theory]] book (perhaps [[Music Theory/Jazz]] ?) until we have enough material for an entire textbook dedicated to jazz. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 19:09, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

{{intricate template}}

The '''[[Template:Drugbox]]''' allows a consistent interface to other sources that provide information about a drug, fixed drug-combinations, vaccines or monoclonal antibody drugs. Don't worry about trying to fill in all the fields -- even specifying just one or two can still be useful.  This template now allows for combination products (see [[#Combination products]]), monoclonal antibody (see [[#Monoclonal antibody drug]]) and vaccine products (see [[#Vaccine product]]).

=== Combination products ===

This uses a different subset of parameters, defining the parameter '''type=combo'''. Generally combination articles will not need display the molecular images of its constituents (the relevant specific articles would have the images). It disables all Chemical &amp; Pharmacology parameters (which describe properties of single drug items). These redundant disabled parameters are best not included in the template calling, so use the following abridged forms of the template:

Note that for drug-combinations at least two components must be defined, with optional 3rd or 4th components. For each component:
* define its name (which will be automatically wikilinked)
* and the class of agent it belongs to but this usually needs manual wikilinking, e.g. for [[w:Seretide|Seretide]]:

=== Monoclonal antibody drugs ===

This uses a different subset of parameters, defining the parameter '''type=mab'''. This allows the alternative parameter of the derived source and target of action to be specified. The MAB name has appended after it a &quot;?&quot; linked to [[w:Nomenclature of monoclonal antibodies|Nomenclature of monoclonal antibodies]], saving on the need explain how each MAB has been named.

=== Vaccines ===

This uses a different subset of parameters, defining the parameter '''type=vaccine'''. This allows the alternative parameters of the '''vaccine_type''' and '''target''' to be specified:
* '''target''' is freetext. Usually will be wikified by the editor to point to a specific page
* '''vaccine_type''' must be from the defined list of options as described at [[w:Vaccine#Type]], the infobox will provide standardised display and links as follows:
:{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! vaccine_type value !! Output
|-
| killed ''or'' inactivated  || Killed/Inactivated

=== General notes about the fields ===

None of the fields are obligatory.
DrugBank does not include every known drug and likewise Protein Binding may not be applicable to the drug (e.g. if only ever applied externally), so if these fields are not defined then their row is not shown.

Don't worry about getting all the fields -- just do your best, and if you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to ask at [[Template talk:Drugbox]].

==== Image ====

You can use the '''image''' to provide an illustration. These fields are optional, but it is helpful to provide an image if you can find one. Of course most images on the internet are copyrighted.  

You may specify the image name directly, else the template defaults to trying to use PAGENAME (the name of the drug article being written).

The '''alt''' parameter specifies the alt text for the image, used by visually impaired readers. See [[w:WP:ALT|WP:ALT]]

There is also an optional '''width''' parameter you can add for the image. If your picture is far too big, then add a new line and specify a custom width like this: 

  | image            = Aspirin.png
  | width            = 325

When no width parameter is specified, it defaults to a width of 220.

Occasionally a second image might be added to show the chemical structure in a different format. Use the optional '''image2''' parameter for this. Hence the [[w:Paracetamol|Paracetamol]] article uses:

  | image            = Paracetamol-skeletal.png 
  | image2           = Paracetamol-3D.png 

An '''alt2''' parameter specifies the alt text for the second image.
image2 generally uses the same width settings as the first image, i.e. as defined by '''width''' otherwise a default value of 220. A specific '''width2''' may though be applied.

==== ATC, ATCvet and CAS ====

Where the drug is not included in ATC coding system (as opposed to its value just not been entered into the template) then set '''ATC_prefix''' to 'none':
&lt;pre&gt;
  | ATC_prefix        = none
&lt;/pre&gt;
  
Additional ATC or CAS codes may be included with the optional  '''ATC_supplemental''' &amp; '''CAS_supplement''' parameter as a comma-separated lists. CAS or ATC templates may be used to have these additional codes link to the relevant databases:
&lt;pre&gt;
  | CAS_supplemental ={{CAS|427-51-0}} (acetate)
  | ATC_supplemental ={{ATC|M02|AA15}}, {{ATC|S01|BC03}}  
&lt;/pre&gt;
Adds the following linked codes:
 For CAS -  {{CAS|427-51-0}} (acetate)
 For ATC - {{ATC|M02|AA15}}, {{ATC|S01|BC03}}

Veterinary drugs are placed in a slightly different classification system, [[w:Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System#ATCvet|ATCvet]]. The code may be specified as ATCvet by setting the parameter '''ATCvet''' to 'yes'. Do not include the leading 'Q' in '''ATC_prefix''':
&lt;pre&gt;
  | ATCvet            = yes 
  | ATC_prefix        = N05
  | ATC_suffix        = AX90
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Dependence liability ====

An optional parameter of '''Dependence liability''' allows opioids or benzodiazepines to be flagged with the risk of becoming dependent upon them, although in many cases this may be somewhat subjective. Drugs should be rated as ''Low'', ''Medium'', ''High'' or ''Extremely High'':

  | dependency_liability=High 

==== Physical properties ====

Additional optional physical proprerties are for [[w:Melting point|Melting point]], [[w:Boiling point|Boiling point]], [[w:Specific rotation|Specific rotation]] and [[w:Standard enthalpy change of combustion|Standard enthalpy change of combustion]]

  | melting_point    =
  | boiling_point    =
  | specific_rotation=
  | sec_combustion   =

==== Chemical formula ====

You can provide the chemical formula as either the default

  | chemical_formula =

or by setting atom counts for each element, in these parameters:

  | C= | H= | Ag= | As= | Au= | B= | Bi= | Br= | Cl= | Co= | F= | Gd= | I= | K= | Mn=
  | N= | Na= | O= | P= | Pt= | S= | Sb= | Se= | Sr= | Tc= | Zn= | charge=

 e.g.   | C=2 | H=6 | O=1
 gives  Formula   &lt;font color=&quot;000000&quot;&gt;[[w:Carbon|C]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;4D4D4D&quot;&gt;[[w:Hydrogen|H]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;742323&quot;&gt;[[w:Oxygen|O]]&lt;/font&gt;

Irrespective of the order of assigning values to the constituent parameters, the formula is displayed with elements in the above order. The charge parameter, if defined, is shown superscripted. 
 
 e.g.   | C=2 | O=1 | H=6 | charge=+   is identical to next line
        | C=2 | H=6 | O=1 | charge=+
 giving Formula   &lt;font color=&quot;000000&quot;&gt;[[w:Carbon|C]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;4D4D4D&quot;&gt;[[w:Hydrogen|H]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;742323&quot;&gt;[[w:Oxygen|O]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

==== Licensing information ====

There are two major licensing authorities that make drug information easily accessible: The US [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and the [[w:European Medicines Agency|European Medicines Agency]] (EMEA). NB The word &quot;Licence&quot; is the noun in British English, &quot;License&quot; is the verb.

The FDA &quot;Label Information&quot; and the EMEA &quot;Product Information&quot;, where available, are very detailed. There is material aimed at the professional and also plain-English consumer information. These are excellent reliable source for article information but also contains much that makes it a worthwhile &quot;External link&quot; since there is no way one can include all the info. Both sites work using of the brand name of the drug but the FDA site also allows searches with the generic name (active ingredient), which lists generic variants where they are licensed. 
&lt;pre&gt;
  | licence_EU =    &lt;!-- EMEA requires brand name --&gt; 
  | licence_US =    &lt;!-- FDA may use generic name --&gt;  
&lt;/pre&gt;
Lists of products and the parameter term to use may be easily searched for: 
* European Public Assessment Reports [http://www.emea.europa.eu/sitemap.htm SiteMap]. Authorised Products: [http://www.emea.europa.eu/htms/human/epar/a-fepar.htm EMEA A-F], [http://www.emea.europa.eu/htms/human/epar/g-lepar.htm EMEA G-L], [http://www.emea.europa.eu/htms/human/epar/m-repar.htm EMEA M-R], [http://www.emea.europa.eu/htms/human/epar/s-zepar.htm EMEA S-Z]
*: When items are composed of more than one word, '''licence_EU''' uses adjoined words (i.e. no spaces); e.g. ''infanrixpenta'' for Infanrix Penta.
* Drugs@FDA [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.Search_Drug_Name Search by Drug Name or Active Ingredient]
*: Where items are composed of more than one word, '''licence_US''' requires an underscore '_' in place of any spaces; e.g. ''Acyclovir_Sodium''.

More patient friendly than the FDA's pages is [[w:Daily Med|Daily Med]] which reproduces the same details. The '''DailyMedID''' parameter, where specified, is shown in preference to the licence_US direct FDA link. Daily Med entries may be located at [http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/about.cfm Search By Drug Name], e.g. for [[w:Furosemide|Furosemide]]
&lt;pre&gt;
  | DailyMedID = 3940
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Legal status ====

Legal status has been previously declared using just the '''legal_status''' parameter with a variety of markup styles used to indicate various countries and their classifications. Alternatively '''legal_AU''', '''legal_CA''', '''legal_UK''' and '''legal_US''' may be set to the fixed options in the table below. The template will ensure the categorisation is shown correctly capitalised, use Unicode Rx symbol and add a linked 2-letter country code as per [[w:WP:MOS|WP:MOS]]. '''legal_status''' may still be used with the country-specific parameters as it is appended afterwards, allowing backwards compatibility for articles that only define this parameter, or for the future with free-text of other information.

 Hence | legal_AU     = S2
       | legal_UK     = gsl
       | legal_US     = Rx-only
       | legal_status = Not marketed in Asia

 Gives S2&lt;small&gt;([[w:Australia|AU]])&lt;/small&gt; POM&lt;small&gt;([[w:United Kingdom|UK]])&lt;/small&gt; {{Unicode|℞}}-only&lt;small&gt;([[w:United States|US]])&lt;/small&gt;  Not marketed in Asia

Note: if a drug is restricted everywhere to prescription-only, please set '''legal_status = Rx-only''' rather than similarly define for each and every country ('Rx-only' is specifically recognised by legal_status and shows as ''{{Unicode|℞}} P&lt;small&gt;rescription only&lt;/small&gt;'')

==== Pregnancy category ====

Pregnancy Categorisation has been previously declared using just the '''pregnancy_category''' parameter with a variety of markup styles used to indicate various countries and their classifications. Alternatively '''pregnancy_AU''' and '''pregnancy_US''' may be set to the fixed categories. For Australia values permitted are: A, B1, B2, B3, C, D or X (note if just set to 'B' then '''B?''' is shown). For US values permitted are: A, B, C, D or X.

Note the UK does not have official designated categorisations, but has both a variety of standard phrases with explanatory qualifications, plus many individual descriptions. '''pregnancy_category''' may still be used with the country-specific parameters as it is appended afterwards, allowing backwards compatibility for articles that only define this parameter, or for the future with free-text of other information.
&lt;pre&gt;
 Hence | pregnancy_AU = B1
       | pregnancy_US = C
       | pregnancy_category = Used in pregnancy
           for [[w:Pregnancy-induced hypertension|PIH]]
&lt;/pre&gt;
 Gives B1&lt;small&gt;([[w:Australia|AU]])&lt;/small&gt; C&lt;small&gt;([[w:United States|US]])&lt;/small&gt; Used in pregnancy for [[w:Pregnancy-induced hypertension|PIH]]

==== Chemical data ====

Optional additional chemical data fields of [[w:Simplified molecular input line entry specification|SMILES]] and [[w:Synonyms|Synonyms]] are for most drugs '''not helpful''' to the wider readership. 

  | smiles            = 
  | synonyms          = 

==== Physical data ====

This is an entirely optional section, and for most drugs is '''not helpful''' to the wider readership. Only include if information of particular interest for the drug as to its chemical propersites (e.g. in its manufacture or as an important chemical in its own right, e.g. [[w:Aspirin|Aspirin]]). If any of the following optional parameters are defined then a new section header of 'Physical data' is shown.
 
  | density           = 
  | melting_point     = 
  | boiling_point     = 
  | solubility        = 
  | specific_rotation = 
  | sec_combustion    = 

The template will add the following to the numeric values provided:
*'''Density''' - added 'g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'
*'''Melting''' or '''Boiling''' points - added '°C' along with calculated converted value in °F.
*'''Solubility''' - added 'mg/mL (20°C)'

 Hence:  | melting_point = 100
 gives:  Melting point   100°C (212°F)

In addition, where the melting point occurs over a range of temperatures, use '''melting_high''' for the upper value.

 Hence:  | melting_point = 100
         | melting_high  = 104
 gives:  Melting point   100-104 °C (212-219 °F)

Comments can be added to the melting and boiling point entries using '''melting_notes''' and '''boiling_notes'''

 Hence:  | boiling_point = 100
         | boiling_notes = (sublimes)
 gives:  Boiling point   100 °C (212 °F) (sublimes)

'''CAS registry numbers''' are unique numerical [[w:identifier|identifier]]s for [[w:chemical element|chemical element]]s, [[w:chemical compound|compounds]], [[w:polymer|polymer]]s, biological sequences, mixtures and [[w:alloy|alloy]]s. They are also referred to as '''CAS numbers''', '''CAS RNs''' or '''CAS #s'''. This template is used to cite CAS numbers within articles.

=== Usage ===
{{tlx|CAS|74-79-3|(L-arginine)&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;157-06-2 (D-arginine)}}

If the first parameter contains a valid CAS-number bevat (e.g. no letters) a link will be placed to the &quot;National Library of Medicine - Medical Subject Headings&quot;. If it is not a valid number, plain text will be shown. In any case, leading and ending spaces are trimmed. Text in the second parameter (if given) will be shown as plain text.

=== Example ===

:{{CAS|74-79-3|(L-arginine)&lt;br/&gt;157-06-2 (D-arginine)}}

=== Error messages ===
#Parameter is empty (no CAS number given)

This template takes same parameter structure as for {{tl|eMedicine}} but does not conclude with &quot;at eMedicine&quot;.

See {{tl|EMedicine/doc}} for usage

:&lt;code&gt;Hence: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{EMedicine2|article|806890}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;Gives: {{EMedicine2|article|806890}}&lt;/code&gt;

Whilst the previous eMedicine website style preserved in this template's coding (eMedicine site internaly will redirect to the same article)
:&lt;code&gt;Hence: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{EMedicine2|emerg|43}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;Gives: {{EMedicine2|emerg|43}}&lt;/code&gt;

==Notes on use==

This template may be used to externally link to [[w:eMedicine|eMedicine]] articles.

Please note that as eMedicine been incorporated more into Medscape main site, so there has been a change in its internal article structuring. The old URL links, and thus old usage of this template, still works but searching the eMedicine website site now will of course give us the direct web page link. Backwards compatability of this template has been preserved and it still uses 2 obligatory parameters and 2 optional parameters - for the old use of this template see the &quot;Past usage&quot; section of this documentation.

===Current usage===
It requires at least two parameters, firstly the now fixed eMedicine &quot;article&quot; space, and then a second article-number. It  may optionally have a third parameter giving alternative text of the disease name, and finally an optional fourth parameter to a section name (an alternative to the default &quot;-overview&quot; suffix).

As an example for the Emergency Medicine page for Asthma:
 Hence: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{EMedicine|article|806890}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 Gives: {{EMedicine|article|806890}}

 Whilst &lt;nowiki&gt;{{EMedicine|article|806890|Asthma}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 Gives: {{EMedicine|article|806890|Asthma}}

 Section &lt;nowiki&gt;{{EMedicine|article|806890|Asthma|treatment}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 Gives: {{EMedicine|article|806890|Asthma|treatment}}

====eMedicine URLs====
This template configures the url for: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/&lt;&lt;article number&gt;&gt;-&lt;&lt;section|&quot;overview&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;


===Past usage===
This template still works for the previous structure using required two parameters of medical &lt;&lt;field&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;topic number&gt;&gt;, the optional third parameter giving &lt;&lt;alternative text&gt;&gt; of the disease name, and the optional fourth parameter to a &lt;&lt;section&gt;&gt; name.

 Hence: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{EMedicine|emerg|43}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 Gives: {{EMedicine|emerg|43}}

 Whilst &lt;nowiki&gt;{{EMedicine|emerg|43|Asthma}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 Gives: {{EMedicine|emerg|43|Asthma}}

 Section &lt;nowiki&gt;{{EMedicine|emerg|43|Asthma|Medication}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 Gives: {{EMedicine|emerg|43|Asthma|Medication}}

====eMedicine URLs====
Where the first parameter is not set to &quot;article&quot;, this template backwards configures the url for: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.emedicine.com/&lt;&lt;field&gt;&gt;/topic&lt;&lt;topic number&gt;&gt;.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt; and optional section of #section~&lt;&lt;section&gt;&gt;

&lt;includeonly&gt;{{esoteric}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;

{{tl|{{PAGENAME}}}} is a little more complicated than others, so an explanation of its use is provided below.

The goal of the template is to directly link to the [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]]'s [[w:ICD|ICD-10]] website. Unfortunately, the design of that website and the design of MediaWiki mean that certain compromises had to be made in the template.

==The parameters==
The template takes 5 parameters:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ICD10|Group|Major|minor|LinkGroup|LinkMajor}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
*'''Group''' - The upper-case Group letter to be displayed in Wikipedia
*'''Major''' - Major group number (2 digits)
*'''minor''' - Minor group number (optional)
*'''LinkGroup''' - lower-case repeat of the '''Group''' letter to be presented to the WHO's website
*'''LinkMajor''' - The major coding at &lt;u&gt;the top of webpage&lt;/u&gt; in which target '''Major''' code exists (may or may not be the same as '''Major''' itself - see below) 

===Capitalization===
The ICD10 code R03 is for &quot;Abnormal blood-pressure reading, without diagnosis&quot;. The WHO website uses lowercase letters for the chapter, as follows:

* http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gm80.htm+m832

Prior to October 2006, the WHO's site would give the correct page, but not the correct anchor if a capital letter was used. Hence the template needed to present lower-case letters to the WHO website but  upper-cases letters to the wikipedia page. Although, as of October 2006, the WHO site now permits upper-case letters, there is no guarantee that this will remain the case and so a lower-case version (the '''LinkGroup''' second-to-last parameter) should continue to be used.

===Determining the page===
To add further complexity, compare the following three entries:
* A03: http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?ga00.htm#a03
* A38: http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?ga30.htm#a38
* A60: http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?ga50.htm#a60

From this, we know that there is an additional parameter that needs to be passed, to identify which page the code is on (the '''LinkGroup''' parameter). There isn't any predictable relationship, but if you go to the WHO site and search on the condition, and then scroll to the top, you can identify what the first code on the page is, and use that to identify the last parameter.

===Examples of use===
All of the above may seem confusing, but examples should make it clearer:

* A03: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ICD10|A|03||a|00}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;: {{ICD10|A|03||a|00}}
* A38: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ICD10|A|38||a|30}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;: {{ICD10|A|38||a|30}}
* A60: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ICD10|A|60||a|50}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;: {{ICD10|A|60||a|50}}
* G08: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ICD10|G|08||g|00}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;: {{ICD10|G|08||g|00}}
* H05.5: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ICD10|H|05|5|h|00}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;: {{ICD10|H|05|5|h|00}}
* H67: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ICD10|H|67||h|00}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;: {{ICD10|H|67||h|65}}
* M83.2: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ICD10|M|83|2|m|80}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;: {{ICD10|M|83|2|m|80}}
* P04.1: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ICD10|P|04|1|p|00}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;: {{ICD10|P|04|1|p|00}}
* R03: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ICD10|R|03||r|00}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;: {{ICD10|R|03||r|00}}

Note that there is no period inside &quot;P04.1&quot; when presented by the template. There doesn't appear to be any way to make the period optional. However, the presentation of the ICD code without the period is also commonly found on the web (for example, at [https://apps.ibc.ca/codes/CIHI_ICDsearch.aspx this site]) so the confusion caused by the omission of the period should be minimal.

[[Template talk:ICD10|Suggestions and feedback]] are welcome. Despite the limitations of the template, it still should be useful in making the classification of medical articles easier to validate against external sources

==Usage==
This template creates a very concise reference citation to a specific numbered page at the Online [[w:Mendelian Inheritance in Man|Mendelian Inheritance in Man]] database.

'''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{OMIM2|#####}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''', where &quot;#####&quot; is the OMIM page number.

Results: {{OMIM2|12345}}

This template is good to use when there is a long series of OMIM citations in a row and one wishes to be as concise as possible with them.  Generally, it should be immediately preceded by use of the {{tl|OMIM}} template.

== What is C shell? ==
{{wikipedia|C shell}}
'''C shell''' is a [[w:Unix Shell|Unix shell]] created in 1979 by Bill Joy soon after the [[w:Bourne shell|Bourne shell]] was released in 1977. Although the latter went on to be the standard shell for Unix, C shell is still popular in BSD distributions. C shell's scripting syntax is modeled after the C language in some aspects.  Small programs can be created by writing scripts using the C shell syntax.

The Bourne shell is also an option to create Unix scripts but if you are reading this book you probably decided the C shell fits your requirements better. Deciding to use a Unix script at all means that the requirements of the program are rather simple, such as automating the usage of either standard or custom Unix tools.  Complex logic or speed sensitive functions should be written in a more appropriate language as custom tools.

Nowadays, [[w:tcsh|tcsh]], a compatible descendant of C shell, is more commonly used.  This book will cover both versions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Purpose==
There are not many C shell scripting books out there. The O'Reilly's book doesn't cover scripting very well. So, figured why not start one here. I use C shell for scripting at work and its a really easy language compared with some contemporaries like Perl. The book will cover both CSH and TCSH. I am planning a hybrid between user guide, reference guide and cookbook. --[[User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] ([[User talk:MarsRover|talk]]) 01:09, 7 September 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How to create a script ==

Unix scripts are generally small and are designed to accomplish a single task. The simplicity of construction makes shell scripts the optimal choice automating command-line tasks . If you already know the commands that were entered to manually get to task done, the program is half finished.  

The &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program is a good starting point to learn a new language such as C shell. We have to first learn the Unix command to print text to the console which is called [[w:echo (command)|echo]]. Just type &quot;echo&quot; followed by what you want to print and it will be print when you run the command.
{{FULLBOOKNAME}}{{FULLBOOKNAME}}{{FULLBOOKNAME}}
 $ '''echo Hello, World!'''
 Hello, World!

Now let's create a text file that will be our script to say hello. We will use a program called [[:w:nano (text editor)|nano]] which is common text editor on Unix. But any editor will do. You noticed we simply named the file &quot;hello&quot; since in Unix the file extension is not required. Although if you wanted an extension, &quot;.csh&quot; is commonly used.

 $ '''nano hello'''

The first line of our script is called a shebang. It consists of a number sign and an exclamation point character (#!), followed by the full path to the interpreter such as /bin/csh. All scripts under Unix execute using the interpreter specified on a first line.  By including the [[w:Shebang (Unix)|shebang]] line, you can run the program like a compiled application and it will automatically find the shell program to run it.  Noticed that we are using a &quot;-f&quot; option when specifying the path to C shell. This prevents running the user's setup file which needlessly slows and complicates the script.

The second line is the echo command from above which is the actual program logic.

 #!/bin/csh -f
 echo Hello, World!


Now we can save the file and exit the editor. In the case of nano, press the control-X key.

In Unix we must adjust file permissions to be able to execute the script.  The [[w:chmod|chmod]] command is used to mark the file executable. 

 $ '''chmod +x hello'''

Now we can actually run the script. Remember to include the directory in front of the file name. If you are currently in the same directory as the script you must still include the current directory (&quot;./&quot;)

 $ '''./hello'''
 Hello, World!

#All scripts should begin with a interpreter directive called a shebang line.
#In Unix scripts must be given an executable permission to be runnable.
#The &lt;code&gt;echo&lt;/code&gt; command is commonly used to print in a script.

==PGsimple1==
In any typical programming language course, the student gets a project to write a program that generates prime numbers. This is considered to be a relatively easy task which is assigned within the first few weeks of the course. As I'm sure you are aware, a few [[Algorithm Implementation/Mathematics/Prime number generation | simple and effective algorithms]] can be used to complete the assignment within as little as a few minutes. In the following examples, I will be using the Python2.5 programming language to demonstrate such algorithms and compare their efficiencies.

The first algorithm we shall consider will begin with the integer 2 and proceed to select each successive integer as a potential prime, (pp), checking for primacy by testing to see if it can be factored by any previously identified primes, then storing each newly verified prime in a prime set (ps) array.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
	pp = 2
	ps = [pp]
	lim = raw_input(&quot;\nGenerate prime numbers up to what number? : &quot;)
	while pp &lt; int(lim):
		pp += 1
		for a in ps:
			if pp%a==0:
                              break
		else: ps.append(pp)
	return ps
&lt;/source&gt;

Note: The code given above does not constitute a complete program. See Appendix A for a complete program including a user interface.

	Such a rudimentary algorithm takes a strictly brute force approach to effectively achieve the goal of identifying each prime number and storing it in an array. I am sure you would agree that this is also about the least efficient means of generating prime numbers. As we shall see, using elements of sieving processes will increase the efficiency of our program while avoiding the time consuming property of a true Sieve of Erastothenes which selects every consecutive integer as a potential prime before identifying it as factorable and eliminating it as a prime number, much the way PGsimple1 has done.

	These are the best time results taken from 5 test runs at each limit.

	This table records the runtimes for pgsimple1 up to each limit indicated. Please accept that these runtimes and all of the runtimes given throughout this document may differ somewhat from those which you may get running the same program on a computer with different hardware or software as mine, which has an AMD Turion 64 1.9GHz with 2GB RAM, 160GB HDD and Windows Vista.

==PGsimple2==

	A first step at improving this algorithm might be efficiently selecting potential primes. It is most common to see such a device in algorithms which start with the integer 3 and proceed by selecting successive potential primes through the odd integers only. This reduces by half the total number of potential primes which must be tested.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
	pp=2
	ps=[pp]
	pp+=1
	ps.append(pp)
	lim=raw_input(&quot;\nGenerate prime numbers up to what number? : &quot;)
	while pp&lt;int(lim):
		pp+=2
		test=True
		for a in ps:
			if pp%a==0:
                               test=False
                               break
		if test: ps.append(pp)
	return ps
&lt;/source&gt;

	Now, brute force has been augmented by some simple logic to significantly improve efficiency, reducing the number of potential primes by half.

	These are the best time results taken from 5 test runs at each limit.

	This table records the runtimes for pgsimple2 and how many times faster it completes the run up to each limit compared to pgsimple1. Note that the efficiency remains close to double that of pgsimple1 at any limit. Even at this speed, it is still quite impractical to generate 8 digit primes or more. But, I did it just to see how long it would take.

==PGsimple3==

	The next most obvious improvement would probably be limiting the testing process to only checking if the potential prime can be factored by those primes less than or equal to the square root of the potential prime, since primes larger than the square root of the potential prime will be complementary factors of at least one prime less than the square root of the potential prime.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
	pp=2
	ps=[pp]
	pp+=1
	ps.append(pp)
	lim=raw_input(&quot;\nGenerate prime numbers up to what number? : &quot;)
	while pp&lt;int(lim):
		pp+=2
		test=True
		sqrtpp=sqrt(pp)
		for a in ps:

			if pp%a==0:
                               test=False
                               break
		if test: ps.append(pp)
	return ps
&lt;/source&gt;

	This algorithm makes truly significant strides in efficiency and, at this point, most programmers have exhausted their ability or desire to continue improving the efficiency of the prime number generator, but we shall go on.

	These are the best time results taken from 5 test runs at each limit.

	This table records the runtimes for pgsimple3 and how many times faster it completes the run up to each limit compared to pgsimple1 and pgsimple2. Note that the longer the program is run, the more significant the efficiency becomes.

==PGsimple4==

	Recognizing that by using a skip number of 2 to select only odd potential primes, it is no longer necessary to test potential primes against all the primes less than the square root of the prime, as none of them can be factored by 2. Therefore, we can remove the first prime number from the set of primes which we test potential primes against. This requires dividing the prime set (ps) array into excepted prime (ep) and test prime (tp) arrays, then recombining them at the end to send the complete set back to the function call.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
	pp=2
	ep=[pp]
	pp+=1
	tp=[pp]
	ss=[2]
	lim=raw_input(&quot;\nGenerate prime numbers up to what number? : &quot;)
	while pp&lt;int(lim):
		pp+=ss[0]
		test=True
		sqrtpp=sqrt(pp)
		for a in tp:
			if a&gt;sqrtpp: break
			if pp%a==0:
                               test=False
                               break
		if test: tp.append(pp)
	ep.reverse()
	[tp.insert(0,a) for a in ep]
	return tp
&lt;/source&gt;

	In the next version it will be shown why we put the skip number (2) into a skip set (ss) array.

	This table records the runtimes for pgsimple4 and how many times faster it completes the run up to each limit compared to pgsimple3.

	What improvement in efficiency? Note that there is only a marginal increase in efficiency compared to pgsimple3. Worry not, increases in efficiency multiply as more primes are eliminated from the testing process in the more advanced version of the program which I will show you next.

==PG7.8==

	This algorithm efficiently selects potential primes by eliminating multiples of previously identified primes from consideration and minimizes the number of tests which must be performed to verify the primacy of each potential prime. While the efficiency of selecting potential primes allows the program to sift through a greater range of numbers per second the longer the program is run, the number of tests which need to be performed on each potential prime does continue to rise, (but rises at a slower rate compared to other algorithms). Together, these processes bring greater efficiency to generating prime numbers, making the generation of even 10 digit verified primes possible within a reasonable amount of time on a PC.

Further skip sets can be developed to eliminate the selection of potential primes which can be factored by each prime that has already been identified. Although this process is more complex, it can be generalized and made somewhat elegant. At the same time, we can continue to eliminate from the set of test primes each of the primes which the skip sets eliminate multiples of, minimizing the number of tests which must be performed on each potential prime. This example is fully commented, line by line, with some explanation to help the reader fully comprehend how the algorithm works. A complete program including a user interface, but without the comments, can be found in Appendix B.

	Please disregard syntactical errors which occur in the user interface such as “the 1th prime”, instead of “1st”, and the inclusion of the last prime generated in the completed array even though it may be larger than the user defined limit. These errors can easily be corrected at the convenience of the student programmer, but were not necessary to illustrate the performance of the algorithms. I apologize for any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused the reader. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
lim=raw_input(&quot;\nGenerate prime numbers up to what number? : &quot;)
&quot;&quot;&quot; Get an upper limit from the user to determine the generator's termination point. &quot;&quot;&quot;
sqrtlim=sqrt(float(lim))
&quot;&quot;&quot; Get the square root of the upper limit. This will be the upper limit of the test prime array 
for primes used to verify the primacy of any potential primes up to (lim). Primes greater than 
(sqrtlim) will be placed in an array for extended primes, (xp), not needed for the verification 
test. The use of an extended primes array is technically unnecessary, but helps to clarify that we 
have minimized the size of the test prime array. &quot;&quot;&quot;
pp=2
&quot;&quot;&quot; Initialize the variable for the potential prime, setting it to begin with the first prime 
number, (2). &quot;&quot;&quot;
ss=[pp]
&quot;&quot;&quot; Initialize the array for the skip set, setting it at a single member, being (pp=2). Although 
the value of the quantity of members in the skip set is never needed in the program, it may be 
useful to understand that future skip sets will contain more than one member, the quantity of which 
can be calculated, and is the quantity of members of the previous skip set multiplied by one less 
than the value of the prime which the new skip set will exclude multiples of. Example - the skip 
set which eliminates multiples of primes up through 3 will have (3-1)*1=2 members, since the 
previous skip set had 1 member. The skip set which eliminates multiples of primes up through 5 will 
have (5-1)*2=8 members, since the previous skip set had 2 members, etc. &quot;&quot;&quot;
ep=[pp]
&quot;&quot;&quot; Initialize the array for primes which the skip set eliminate multiples of, setting the first 
member as (pp=2) since the first skip set will eliminate multiples of 2 as potential primes. &quot;&quot;&quot;
pp+=1
&quot;&quot;&quot; Advance to the first potential prime, which is 3. &quot;&quot;&quot;
rss=[ss[0]]
&quot;&quot;&quot; Initialize an array for the ranges of each skip set, setting the first member to be the range 
of the first skip set, which is (ss[0]=2). Future skip sets will have ranges which can be 
calculated, and are the sum of the members of the skip set. Another method of calculating the range 
will also be shown below. &quot;&quot;&quot;
tp=[pp]
&quot;&quot;&quot; Initialize an array for primes which are needed to verify potential primes against, setting the 
first member as (pp=3), since we do not yet have a skip set that excludes multiples of 3. Also note 
that 3 is a verified prime, without testing, since there are no primes less than the square root of 
3. &quot;&quot;&quot;
i=0
&quot;&quot;&quot; Initialize a variable for keeping track of which skip set range is current. &quot;&quot;&quot;
rss.append(rss[i]*tp[0])
&quot;&quot;&quot; Add a member to the array of skip set ranges, the value being the value of the previous skip 
set range, (rss[0]=2), multiplied by the value of the largest prime which the new skip set will 
exclude multiples of, (tp[0]=3), so 2*3=6. This value is needed to define when to begin 
constructing the next skip set. &quot;&quot;&quot;
xp=[]
&quot;&quot;&quot; Initialize an array for extended primes which are larger than the square root of the user 
defined limit (lim) and not needed to verify potential primes against, leaving it empty for now. 
Again, the use of an extended primes array is technically unnecessary, but helps to clarify that we 
have minimized the size of the test prime array. &quot;&quot;&quot;
pp+=ss[0]
&quot;&quot;&quot; Advance to the next potential prime, which is the previous potential prime, (pp=3), plus the 
value of the next member of the skip set, which has only one member at this time and whose value is 
(ss[0]=2), so 3+2=5. &quot;&quot;&quot;
npp=pp
&quot;&quot;&quot; Initialize a variable for the next potential prime, setting its value as (pp=5). &quot;&quot;&quot;
tp.append(npp)
&quot;&quot;&quot; Add a member to the array of test primes, the member being the most recently identified prime, 
(npp=5). Note that 5 is a verified prime without testing, since there are no TEST primes less than 
the square root of 5. &quot;&quot;&quot;

	These are the best time results taken from 5 test runs at each limit.

	This table records the runtimes for pg7.8 and how many times faster it completes the run up to each limit compared to pgsimple1 and pgsimple4. Note that again the longer the program is run, the more significant the efficiency becomes.

== A note from the author ==

Thank you for taking the time to study the algorithm and I hope that it has inspired you. If you choose to translate this algorithm into another programming language, please email a copy of your work to cfo@mfbs.org.

== A note from the prime-number-best-algorithm owner ==

Well, all steps are ok, but you stop at the very beginnig; as long as you can state that all 2N with N&gt;1 '''are not''' primes you can also state that all primes except 3 are not in the form 3N and so on.

It lead at first step to the known primes form of 6N±1 (that is elegant but wrong, the really form is 6N+1 or 6N+5) but you can do better, as long you use 30N+1, 30N+7, 30N+11 ..... 30N+29 or even better with 210N+1, 210N+11, 210N+13 ...... 210N+209

in short : exist an algorithm to reduce the &quot;search field&quot; in a smart way, using 1*1, 1*2, 1*2*3, 1*2*3*5, 1*2*3*5*7 .... as &quot;base&quot; and a list of &quot;displacements&quot; to add.

but the speed is still compromised by the presence of multiple, always growing, &quot;sqrt&quot; and &quot;div&quot; (or better &quot;mod&quot;) operations.

the sqrt operations can be &quot;reversed&quot;, simply doing a N^2 that limits validity of your tests : the benefit in time-terms is great!

also &quot;module&quot; ops can be avoided, but the trick is a little bit long to be wrote, will do sometime in future

in short : there is no need to calculate primes as long as you can guess them and are able to distinguish between &quot;real&quot; and &quot;fake&quot; ones.

A juice extractor is a machine that mechanically separates juice from the solid part (pulp) of most [[Cookbook:fruit|fruits]], [[Cookbook:vegetable|vegetables]], leafy greens, and [[Cookbook:herb|herbs]]. The pulp is usually discarded, but can also be used in muffins and breads or composting.

Most juice extractors are electric, which requires less effort than their manual counterparts. A juicer differs from a [[Cookbook:blender|blender]]: a juicer separates the juice from the pulp, a blender mixes everything together by liquefying the pulp.

There are three main types of juicer: centrifugal juicers use blades and a sieve to separate juice from pulp; masticating juicers that 'chew' fruit to a pulp before squeezing out the juice; and, triturating juicers that have twin gears to first crush fruit and then press it. 

Masticating and triturating juicers can also juice wheatgrass unlike centrifugal juicers that cannot break the fibres of the grass.

The single auger masticating juicer uses a profiled screw style moulding to compact and crush fruit and vegetable matter against a static screen allowing juice to flow through the screen while pulp is expelled through a separate outlet. 

Twin gear triturating machines are usually the most expensive juicers offering the best juice yield. Twin gear juicers employ two metal counter rotating gears to crush the juicing fodder. The precise tolerance of the gears allows the juice to flow through the gap between the gears while the large pulpy matter passes along the top of the gears and is discharged.

Several kitchen tools are made for extracting juice from various foods.  There are several varieties of hand-held lemon and lime presses.  There are also small devices that do not use electrical power and can be used for extracting juice when a large amount is not needed.

==Usage==

A simple template for presenting important definitions in the [[Calculus]] textbook.

It takes two named parameters:

;text
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Calculus/Def | text=My definition.}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

;title
:''Optional.'' The title is displayed at the top of the box in bold.
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Calculus/Def | title=Theorem | text=My definition.}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The parameters are named because [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Template#Restrictions_on_parameters_and_parameter_values unnamed parameters can't have &quot;=&quot; signs] without some finagling by users of the template.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to this encyclopedia which aims to explain as many self-help techniques as possible. We are always looking for new therapies, techniques or anything else that isn't already written here. We aim to provide a resource that ''anyone'' can use, from those suffering from stress to those with more serious disorders such as severe depression, schizophrenia and bipolar. It is hosted on Wikibooks as we feel all these techniques should be free for everyone to use; not only available to those who can afford a self-help book they will probably never read.

The project aims to provide a page on each therapy containing:
# Explain what it does and how it can help
# Explain how to put the technique into practice
# Provide an active discussion platform for ANYONE that has experienced these therapies and whether they work or not.

We also aim to provide all therapies regardless of their medical status, with the hope that as more people talk about and rate each therapy it will act as a basis to make your own choice rather than believing hype from &quot;that new therapy&quot; or believing it when they say psychiatrists know everything. As such we also cannot guarantee the effectiveness of any of these treatments (including psychiatrists!) and recommend you contact your local GP, Doctor or Physician before embarking on any of these therapies.

For now the remainder of this page will simply be a list, however in the future it may be split up into sections like medical therapies, alternative therapies, traditional Chinese medicines, etc.

Where a technique can't be directly used because of copyright or patents, we will create an alternative that follows the principle of that particular technique.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;ref&gt;An '''antidepressant''' is a type of medication that is used to treat people with mood disorders including depression. There are different types of antidepressant such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).

Antidepressants work to improve the mood. Doctors think that when someone is depressed, the chemicals in their brain are not working properly. In theory, antidepressants balance these chemicals, lifting the depression.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Why might this help?==

If you suffer from a low mood that is affecting your ability to work and/or enjoy life, Anti-depressants may be able to help.

==How do I get them?==

Antidepressants can only be prescribed by a GP, Physician or Doctor, and are likely to be included with some sort of talking therapy. Higher doses are usually only available with the supervision of a Psychiatrist.

==How do they work?==

They effect chemicals in the brain to do with transferring information, however they are not completely understood. Basically this theory of depression involves the chemicals not having time to be transferred before they are recycled; so anti-depressants prevent them being recycled for a while longer.

Because the brain takes time to get used to the tablet's effect, it can take up to a month before they work properly. You can feel very tired over this month. This is because the brain isn't used to the flood of chemicals the medication results in, so it needs to adjust.

==How do I use them?==

Antidepressants are usually taken once or twice a day with a drink (preferably with water). There are no other steps, although you do need to make sure you take it at the same time everyday, or it may leave you feeling funny for a few days.

==User Reviews==
(Please finish review with four tildes. If you wish to remain anonymous, sign out and leave your review, then sign back in again. Discussion of the page content should be made on the discussion page, not here!).

I have been on and off of anti-depressants for nearly 6 years. They were prescribed to me when I was misdiagnosed with depression, and led to a worsening of my symptoms of Bipolar Disorder. I feel they have had no help other than making me addicted to them, as it is very difficult to come off them without side effects. Better effects to my life were only made after different lifestyle changes. However, anti-depressants are the most tested medication you can get, and are approved by the medical community.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Entropy ==

Entropy is a measure of unpredictability.
Understanding entropy not only helps you understand data compression,
but can also help you choose good passwords and avoid easily-guessed passwords.

For example, 1000 bits of data representing 1000 consecutive tosses of a fair coin has an entropy of 1000 bits, since there is no way to predict whether &quot;heads&quot; or &quot;tails&quot; will come up next.
1000 bits of data representing 1000 consecutive tosses of an unfair two-headed coin has an entropy of zero (0) bits, since the coin will always come up heads.

The entropy of a message is in a certain sense a measure of how much information it really contains.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Entropy_%28information_theory%29&amp;oldid=440605554 Wikipedia: entropy (information theory)].
Retrieved 2011-07-29.
&lt;/ref&gt;

By taking the consistencies out of a storage element, such as the redundancies, similar components, longest most used words, etc., &lt;s&gt;Compression increases the entropy of the file, until there is so much entropy in the file that it can't be further compressed.&lt;/s&gt; Compression when it shrinks a file, can lead to a higher entropy density per length of file. Which makes a properly compressed file when followed by an encryption pass harder to break in ciphertext only attacks than the file encrypted without the compression done first. See:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicity_distance 

Of course it does not help with most plain text attack modes if attacker gets to pick the plain text you encrypt.

At the same time, the decompression algorythm adds more and more consistency and order to the entropic file, until it means something. &lt;s&gt;One of the reasons that compression does not make a good form of encryption, is that there is information hidden in the entropy of the file, that indicates to the decompression program how to recover it. In fact in extreme compression the amount of data needed to recover the compressed text, is often a greater percentage of the file, than the actual remaining data that has yet to be compressed.&lt;/s&gt;

}}
Entropy is always relative to some model. It is not a property of a particular string of bits that you are given, but of the set of bitstrings that you could plausibly have been given.
For a given set of bits, the model that gives the lowest entropy is the model that best predicts those bits and therefore compresses the data the smallest.
Most compressed file formats, store (a) what model we used, (b) the particular parameters of that model (if any), and (c) the data compressed according to that model.
Some kinds of models have a lot of &quot;parameters&quot; and require a lot of space to store,
so often we use completely unrealistic models -- but ones that require very little space to describe -- in order to reduce the net compressed file size (model description + compressed data).

One of the the simplest models is &quot;Every byte of the file was independently and randomly generated by throwing darts at a wall while blindfolded. Some letters occur more frequently because they have a larger area on the wall.&quot;
This is the order-0 Markov model, also known as the Shannon entropy when each byte is considered an independent message.
Using that model, the entropy &lt;math&gt;H(F_i)&lt;/math&gt; of any particular letter &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; in a file F is

:&lt;math&gt;H(F_i) = -log_2 p( F_i ),&lt;/math&gt;
(This is the number of bits required to represent that letter using an entropy coder)

And the entropy &lt;math&gt;H(F)&lt;/math&gt; of the entire file is the sum of the entropy of each letter in the file,
(the number of bits required to represent the entire file is the sum of the number of bits required to represent each letter in that file)
:&lt;math&gt;H(F) = \sum_{i=1}^N { - \log_2 p(F_i) },&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of the number of unique possible messages n (any particular letter in the file is one of a list n possible letters, from &lt;math&gt;x_1 .. x_n&lt;/math&gt;, any of which may occur 0, 1, or possibly N times)
:&lt;math&gt;H(F) = \sum_{i=1}^n { -p(x_i) \log_2 p(x_i) },&lt;/math&gt;

Where
* &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; is some unique letter, for example 'e'
&lt;s&gt;* &lt;math&gt;f( x_i )&lt;/math&gt; is the number of times that unique letter x_i occurs in the file&lt;/s&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;p( x_i )&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of the symbol &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; (e.g. the character 'e') in the message
* &lt;math&gt;f( F_i )&lt;/math&gt; is the number of times the letter at position i in the file occurs in the file (obviously this is at least 1)
* &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the file (the total number of messages in the file)
* &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of possible messages, often n=257
* &lt;math&gt;p( k ) = \frac{ f( k )}{ N }&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that some letter k occurs.

Often some particular letter x_i in the character set never occurs anywhere in some particular file -- the way the letter 'e' never occurs in ''Gadsby'' (1939).
There can be any number of such letters that never actually occur.
Letters that never occur make no difference to the entropy of any particular letter that does occur, or to the total of them, which is the entropy of the entire file under the order-0 model.
When some letter x_i exists in the character set, but it is never actually used in some particular file, that letter's frequency is zero, its probability is zero, and the value &lt;math&gt;0 log_2 ( 0 )&lt;/math&gt; is effectively zero.

Any arbitrary file, when analyzed using a order-1 Markov model (&quot;first order model&quot;),
will give a number for the entropy that is smaller or the same as the order-0 entropy.

We discuss order-1 Markov and higher-order Markov models in more detail later in this book
([[../../Markov models/]]).

=== How do you further compress data ===

Compression at some point becomes how do you further compress already entropic data, that consists mostly of instructions to decompress a minimal amount of data?

&lt;s&gt;
There are two approaches that might be tried, the first approach is to inject order, without increasing the length of the file, so that you can recover more compression, and the other approach is much more controversial because it suggests the injection of entropy, without changing the length of the file, so that you can recover more compression.

The latter approach is based on a little known scientific principle first explained in &quot;A New Kind of Science&quot;, which suggested that entropy and order are cyclical at least in incremental or decremental type IV cellular automata. This approach which might explain self-organization despite the Second Law of Thermodynamics would mean that sometimes when enough entropy is injected into a data field, the data self-organizes into an orderly state again. If we can keep track of the entropic states that it has gone through to get to the self-organization level, we can compress the new order, with some hope of recovering the original state.
&lt;/s&gt;

== entropy coding ==

statistical symbol compression

prefix coding

=== Huffman encoding ===

For each prefix code in the compressed data, a Huffman decompressor looks up the compressed symbol in a table and emits the corresponding plaintext symbol.

In the following examples, we assume the plaintext symbol is some 8 bit byte.
(Most Huffman decompressors have 257 symbols in their alphabet: the 256 possible bytes, and a special 257th code that indicates &quot;end-of-block&quot;. Some Huffman decompressors have additional compressed symbols that decompress to common byte pairs or entire words, which can lead to smaller compressed file sizes).

Where does the translation table of code-to-letters come from?
The particular source chosen is perhaps the biggest difference
between one Huffman compressed file format and another.
* fixed Huffman codes
* static Huffman codes (sometimes called &quot;semi-adaptive Huffman&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;mcfadden&quot; &gt;
[http://www.fadden.com/techmisc/hdc/lesson12.htm &quot;Hacking Data Compression&quot;]
by Andy McFadden
&lt;/ref&gt; (The RFC 1951 definition of DEFLATE calls this &quot;dynamic Huffman codes&quot;)
* adaptive Huffman codes

(Yes, it's confusing to use &quot;static&quot; as a synonym for &quot;dynamic&quot;. Is it too late to change this now?)

When a decompressor uses a fixed Huffman code, it uses a translation table hard-wired into the decompressor that never changes.

When a decompressor uses a static Huffman code,
it reads the translation table at the beginning of the compressed block.
Then it uses that data to decode the rest of the block.
Most of the &quot;optimality proofs&quot; of Huffman assume this sort of static code.

Often one block of text will have slightly different letter frequencies from another, even inside the same file.
Most static Huffman decompressors watch for a special 257th &quot;end-of-block&quot; symbol, and then discard the old Huffman table and read in a new static compressed table.
The decompressor uses that table to decode the new block.

DEFLATE and some other decompressors
put a few bits of &quot;model selector&quot; metadata at the beginning of every block.
That commands the decompressor to either
* (a) fetch the static Huffman table metadata immediately after the model selector;
* (b) copy the default fixed Huffman table stored inside the decompressor;
* (c) copy the raw data without trying to decompress it -- useful for &quot;uncompressible&quot; data; or
* (d) use some other compression algorithm entirely.

When a decompressor uses an adaptive Huffman code,
it begins with some default translation table.
However, it updates that table with every symbol that goes through.

=== getting the compressor and the decompressor to use the same codewords ===

To get lossless compression, when the compressor represents the byte &quot;e&quot; with the bitstring &quot;010&quot;,
the decompressor has to somehow know that the bitstring &quot;010&quot; must be decoded into the byte &quot;e&quot;.

There are several ways for a Huffman decompressor to &quot;know&quot; the symbol-to-bitstring map (sometimes called a &quot;frequency table&quot;) used by the corresponding Huffman compressor:

* fixed Huffman codes, hard-wired into the decompressor. Avoids sending a frequency table, but can give poor compression -- perhaps even expanding the file -- if the actual probability distribution is significantly different than the assumed probability distribution. The estimated probability distribution changes only when the compressor software changes. This has the lowest latency -- the first few symbols can be immediately encoded and transmitted.
* one dynamic Huffman code, with a single frequency table sent before the file. This requires the compressor to store the entire file, which may be arbitrarily long, while counting symbol frequencies, before generating and sending the first compressed codeword -- this has the worst latency. The estimated probability distribution changes once per file.
* several dynamic Huffman codes, with the file broken up into several blocks and a frequency table sent before each block. This has less latency than one-table-per-file. In cases where the probability distribution changes significantly from one block to the next, the total number of bits needed to store all the codewords can be much less -- but the overhead of the number of bits to send the tables can be much more. Also, the compressor can spend a lot of time trying to squeeze out a few more bits by &quot;optimizing&quot; where exactly to split the file. The estimated probability distribution changes once per block.
** A few file formats (such as bzip2), rather than always sending a complete frequency table that indicates the exact frequency of the next block, sometimes send a short reference to one of the previously-sent frequency tables that (hopefully) is close enough to the frequency of the next block that the expansion (if any) of the codewords in that block is more than paid back by not having to send a complete frequency table.
* adaptive Huffman compression: The estimated probability distribution changes (slightly) once per symbol. The probability distribution of the letters that have streamed past is used to estimate the future probability distribution. This has the second-lowest latency -- the first few symbols can be more-or-less immediately transmitted -- but the decompressor does more work to update the tables on each symbol.

Per-file and per-block dynamic Huffman codes can guarantee that certain symbols never occur in a block,
and so some people write code that entirely eliminates those never-occurs symbols from the tree, reducing the number of bits in at least one codeword that does occur in the compressed text.

Many compression algorithms (including fixed Huffman codes and adaptive Huffman compression) estimate probabilities in a way that cannot guarantee that some symbol will never occur.
In particular, if some symbol is so rare that it has not yet occurred in the training text --
it has zero frequency so far --
it is tempting to assign an estimated zero probability to that symbol.
That leads to [[../../The zero-frequency problem/]].

==== Canonical Huffman code ====

A canonical Huffman code is a kind of Huffman code that can be very compactly described.
That makes it super-wonderful for static Huffman compression.
A large text file may have thousands of sections,
each with a slightly different letter frequency.
Every unnecessary byte in the format we choose for storing the description of the Huffman code table bloats that file by thousands of unnecessary bytes.

For example, the article on x-rays has a much higher frequency of the letter x than the previous article on yellow-bellied sapsuckers.
Giving each section its own optimized Huffman table
minimizes the number of bits required to store that section,
if we pretend that the Huffman table overhead is not significant.
Alas, that Huffman table overhead is often significant.
Many compressors will spend a lot of time thinking about
whether the total file will be shorter if we
(a) use a separate Huffman table for each of several consecutive sections
or (b) merge consecutive sections together into a single block
and use a single compromise Huffman table for the whole block.

&quot;drop some trailing ones, and then increment&quot;

The decompressor needs two things to regenerate a block of plaintext:
the exact Huffman code used by the compressor,
and the series of compressed codewords.

Given any one Huffman code, one can construct many other equivalent codes, all of which have exactly the same codeword length for any particular plaintext symbol, but vary in the exact bit pattern assigned to each plaintext symbol.
Since any particular plaintext symbol is assigned a codeword of a certain length, a length that is the same for every equivalent code, no matter which particular code you choose, any series of plaintext symbols will be compressed into a series of codewords of exactly the same total length.
If the overhead of the prefix code description were insignificant, then it would not matter which of these many equivalent codes you would use -- just pick one at random.
All equivalent codes compress that data to the same number of bits.

However, rather than picking one of them randomly and sending that to the decompressor, we can save bits in the prefix code description by picking one particular canonical Huffman code.

Given only the length, in bits, of the codeword for each symbol of any prefix code,
we can construct the canonical Huffman code that gives every symbol the same length as that original prefix code.&lt;ref&gt;

A given set of probabilities does not result in a unique CH code; one is free to reorder symbols that have the same code length.&lt;ref&gt;

(describing situations where, even though we assign *different* lengths to letters and therefore different canonical Huffman trees, we end up with the same number of compressed bits)
&lt;/ref&gt;

The steps to create a canonical Huffman (CH) code are as follows:

#Sort the symbols by increasing code lengths.
#Store the number of symbols with each code length along with the sorted symbols themselves.
{{todo|1=Adapt the example from http://pineight.com/mw/index.php?title=Huffword}}


== Something about trees ==

{{todo| put a proof that the Huffman algorithm gives the optimal prefix code ?}}

Every prefix code can be thought about as analogous to a tree.

Every leaf on the tree is tagged with a plaintext letter or other symbol.

The length, in bits, of each codeword is sometimes called the path length of the symbol.

== Dynamic Huffman: storing the frequency table ==

(This is a continuation of &quot;getting the compressor and the decompressor to use the same codewords&quot;, for the common case of dynamic Huffman).

Inside a typical compressed file, there is a header before each block of compressed data.
For blocks compressed with dynamic Huffman,
that header for that block tells the decompressor the set of codewords used in that block, and the mapping from codewords to plaintext symbols.

Typically the compressor and the decompressor have some hard-coded alphabet of S plaintext symbols they need to handle.
Often S=258 symbols, the 256 possible bytes and a few other special symbols such as the end-of-block symbol.
Each symbol in the alphabet is represented, in the compressed data, by some codeword with a length in bits from 1 bit to some MAX_CODEWORD_LENGTH bits.

Many simple Huffman file formats simply store that list of 258 bitlengths as a block of 258 bytes.
Each position represents some plaintext symbol -- even ones that are never used in the plaintext --
typically
position 0 represents the 0 byte,
position 32 (0x20) represents the space character,
position __ (0x65) represents letter 'e',
position 255 represents the 255 byte,
position 256 represents some special command, and
position 257 represents the end-of-block indicator.

The number at each position represents the length, in bits, of the codeword corresponding to that plaintext symbol. (Since we use canonical Huffman codes, the length of the codeword corresponding to each plaintext symbol is all the decompressor need to regenerate the actual set of codewords used in this block).
Usually the special &quot;length&quot; of &quot;0 bits&quot; is reserved to indicate letters that never occur in this block, and so should not be included in the Huffman tree.

That list of S numbers is often called the &quot;frequency table&quot;.
Sometimes that list of S numbers is called the &quot;Kraft vector&quot;, because it must satisfy [[w: Kraft's inequality]].

That block of 258 bytes in the header represents a lot of overhead,
especially if the compressed file includes many separate blocks, each with its own header.
Some Huffman compressors, such as English-word-oriented Huffman compressors, use vastly more symbols (one for each word in the English dictionary it uses), requiring a much longer Kraft vector.
There are a variety of ways to get smaller compressed file sizes by designing the file format in a way that reduces the size of this block, including:
* Use exactly the same codeword-to-plaintext-symbol dynamic Huffman mapping, but store that mapping in a more compact form:
** use some kind of length-limited Huffman compression. If there are no codewords longer than 15 bits, then we can store each length in 4 bits, rather than a full 8 bit byte.
** compress the frequency table in isolation, perhaps using RLE or some variable-length code, such as fixed Huffman compression or even another dynamic Huffman &quot;pre-table&quot;.
** When a datafile alternates between two kinds of data -- for example, English text and long tables of numbers -- use simple differential compression to compactly represent later tables as a reference to some earlier table, as in bzip2.
** When a one block of data has slightly different frequencies than the previous block -- for example, an article on X-rays has about the same letter frequencies, except much more 'X' and somewhat fewer 'y', than a previous article on yellow-bellied sap-suckers -- use differential compression to compactly represent the new table by giving the (hopefully relatively small) changes from the previous table, as in LZX. We discuss other kinds of differential compression in a later chapter, [[Data Compression/Inference Compression#data differencing | data differencing]].
** or some combination of the above.
* Use some other codeword-to-plaintext-symbol mapping other than dynamic Huffman mapping
** adaptive Huffman: estimate the future letter frequency on-the-fly from the letters already decoded in the plaintext
** universal codes: ...

==== Implementation tips and tricks ====
People have spent a long time figuring out ways to make Huffman compression and Huffman decompression really, really fast.
These are just a few of the techniques used to make decompressors (or compressors, or both) that give bit-identical the same output that a non-optimized program gives, while running faster.

Software to implement Huffman decompressors typically has 2 parts:
* the setup pulls a compact &quot;frequency table&quot; header, and expands it into some sort of lookup table arranged to make the next part really fast
* the inner loop that converts codewords to plaintext symbols.

The inner loop of a Huffman decompressor finds the codeword that matches the next part of the compressed text, and emits the corresponding plaintext symbol.
It's possible for a codeword to be more than 32 bits long, even when compressing 7-bit ASCII text,
and bit-aligning and comparing such long words can be a bit of a hassle.
There are three approaches to avoiding such long comparisons:
(a) length-limited Huffman code. Often &quot;natural&quot; files never use such long codewords, only specially-constructed specifically designed to be worst-case files.
Some compressors choose to deliberately limit the length of the Huffman code words to some maximum length.
This makes such worst-case files, after compression, slightly longer than they would have been without the limit; it has no effect on the length of compressed &quot;natural&quot; files.
Most file formats intended to be decompressed in hardware (video decompressed with a FPGA, etc.) limit the length in order to reduce the cost of that hardware.
(b) A short, fast table that handles short codewords and has a &quot;long codeword&quot; flag, and other table(s) that handle longer codewords. Since the most frequent Huffman codes are short, the decoder can usually decode a codeword quickly with one hit to the short, fast table that fits entirely in cache; occasionally the decoder would hit a flagged entry, and take a little longer to look up the long code in the other table(s). There's a time/space tradeoff on exactly how short to make the first-level table: a decoder program with a smaller first-level table, compared to a decoder program that uses a larger first-level table, can still correctly decode the same file. The smaller-table decoder uses less RAM, the larger-table decoder decodes more words in the first hit and therefore runs faster (unless the table gets too big to fit in the cache).
(c) rather than comparing directly to codeword bitstrings, first do a zero-count (to the next 1 bit, or to the end of file, whichever comes first) finding Z zeros, discard the 1 bit, and then the next n bits.

Prefix code decompressor implementations can be distinguished by how many bits they read from the compressed stream at one time, and how they use those bits to decide what to do next. People have implemented &quot;fast&quot; decompressors a variety of ways, including:
* One bit at a time: A &quot;simple&quot; prefix decoder typically reads bit-by-bit, one bit at a time, from the compressed stream. This is probably the slowest way.&lt;ref name=&quot;schindler&quot; /&gt;
* always max_codelength bits at a time: one big lookup table indexed directly by multiple bits read from the compressed stream
* one byte (8 bits) at a time: one big lookup table indexed directly by a &quot;tree position&quot; state and a byte read from the compressed stream
* X initial bits, followed by Y following bits, per symbol (where X is some constant, often chosen to be half the number of bits as max_codelength&lt;ref name=&quot;schindler&quot; /&gt;, and Y typically varies depending on the particular value read in the first X bits; X+Y is at most max_codelength):
** a first lookup table indexed by some bits read from the compressed stream, which chooses one of the secondary index tables, indexed by more bits read from the compressed stream
* any number of zero bits, followed by F trailing bits:  (This works for canonical Huffman codes, but may not be useful for other prefix codes).
** one big lookup table indexed by a zero count and bits read from the compressed stream
** a first lookup table indexed by a zero count of bits from the compressed stream, which chooses one of the secondary index tables, indexed by more bits read from the compressed stream.

Conceptually the simplest one is the &quot;one big lookup table&quot; approach:
* one big lookup table
This is probably the fastest technique if your maximum codelength is relatively short.&lt;ref name=&quot;schindler&quot; &gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

One fast inner loop for a fast prefix code decoder reads the compressed data a byte at a time
(rather than the bit-by-bit for a &quot;simple&quot; prefix decoder).
The &quot;current tree position&quot; and the compressed byte are used as an index into
a large table that holds the resulting &quot;new tree position&quot; and up to 8 decompressed plaintext symbols.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pajarola&quot; &gt;

&quot;Proceedings IEEE ITCC Conference&quot;. 2003.
&lt;/ref&gt;
* (new_tree_position, [list of decompressed symbols]) := lookup_table( current_tree_position, compressed_byte )

Any codeword can be represented by two numbers,
(Z count of initial zeros, F value of trailing bits).
For example, the codeword &quot;000101&quot; can be represented by the two values (3,5).
The codeword &quot;11&quot; can be represented by the two values (0,3).

One quirk of the canonical Huffman code is that,
if all our plaintext symbols fit in a n bit fixed-length code,
then Z can be represented in n bits, and F can also be stored in n bits.
(This is *not* true for all prefix codes).
(When the decompressor does the actual zero-count in the compressed text,
consecutive all-zero code words can lead to an indefinite number of consecutive zeros -- 
what I'm trying to point out here is that the number of initial zeros in any one particular codeword can be represented in n bits).
This allows several different time/speed tradeoffs that all give identically the same output file.
Perhaps the fastest inner loop is something like
For each symbol:
* bit-count the zeros into Z
* discard the following 1 bit, keep the &quot;next bit to read&quot; pointer pointing to the *following* bit, but peek ahead at the following n-1 bits and put them into F.
* Pack the least-significant n bits of Z and the n-1 bits of F into a 2n-1 bit index.
* (plaintext_symbol, useful_bits) := lookup_table[index]
* Bump the &quot;next bit to read&quot; pointer by useful_bits bits -- which can be 0 bits for codewords with only one bit after the zeros ( 1, 01, 001, 0001, etc.) up to n-1 bits for codewords with the full n-1 bits after the first 1 bit in the codeword.
* emit the plaintext symbol.
Repeat until we hit the end of file.

This ignores the special-case handling of all-zeros codeword.
Many Huffman coders, such as DEFLATE, design a Huffman table with a &quot;fake&quot; entry such that the compressed text never uses the all-zeros codeword;
so the decompressor never has to deal with that complication.
This also ignores special handling of codewords that map to some special command, rather than mapping to a literal plaintext symbol.
This requires a lookup table of size 2^(2n-1).
For a typical Huffman code with n=9 bits, able to handle all 2^8 bytes a few other special symbols,
using a canonical Huffman code with this kind of implementation requires a lookup table of size 2^(17) = 131 072 entries.
If a plaintext symbol is mapped to a codelength that is less than the maximum codelength, then multiple entries in that table map to the same symbol.
There are other implementations that use far less RAM.
Other implementations may even be faster, since they allow more of the working memory to fit in cache.

In general, for ''alphabet_size'' plaintext symbols, the worst-case maximum &quot;compressed&quot; Huffman code length is ''alphabet_size - 1'' bits long.&lt;ref name=&quot;schindler&quot; /&gt;

For 257 plaintext symbols, the worst (unlikely) case is a maximum bitlength of 2 characters that are &quot;compressed&quot; to 256 bits,
so the maximum zero count (except when we have 1 or more consecutive all-zero codes)
is 255.

Handling the end-of-text is often awkward, since the compressed string of bits is usually stored into some integer number of bytes, even though the compressed string of bits is usually *not* a multiple of 8 bits long.
Most Huffman decompressors use one or the other of the following techniques for handling end-of-text:
* Both the compressor and the decompressor include a special end-of-text symbol in the tree (a 257th symbol when doing binary byte-oriented compression, or the null byte when compressing a null-terminated C string). Since it only occurs once, its frequency is 1 and the code that represents it is therefore is tied in length with one or more longest-possible-length symbols.
** The decompressor immediately returns when it sees the end-of-text symbol, and ignores any pad bits after that symbol that fill up the last byte of storage. Or,
** The compressor tells the decompressor exactly how many valid input bytes are used to hold the compressed bitstring. The decompressor forces the code representing the end-of-text symbol to be the all-zeros symbol. The decompressor fakes reading in zero bits past the last valid input byte -- possibly reading a few zero bits at the end of some other valid symbol -- eventually reading the all-zero end-of-text symbol.
* Some decompressors have no special end-of-text symbol.
** The compressor tells the decompressor exactly how many output symbols are represented by the input compressed bitstring, and the decompressor immediately returns after emitting exactly that many symbols. Or,
** The compressor tells the decompressor exactly how many valid input bytes are used to hold the input compressed bitstring. Occasionally the last valid symbol ends cleanly at the end of the last byte, and the decompressor returns. Other times there are a few leftover bits not long enough to make a complete valid codeword -- all codewords with that prefix are longer. When the leftover bits are all zero, throw away those leftover zero bits and return. (This technique *assumes* that the all-zeros code is at least 8 bits long -- which is always true when there are at least 2^7+1 = 129 symbols in the tree and you use a canonical Huffman code. If you have fewer than 129 symbols, you must use some other technique to handle end-of-text).

=== improving on Huffman ===

The original Huffman algorithm is optimal for symbol-by-symbol coding of a stream of unrelated symbols with a known probability distribution.

However, several algorithms can be used to compress some kinds of files smaller than the Huffman algorithm. These algorithms exploit one or another of the caveats in the Huffman optimality proof:

{{wikipedia| mutual information}}
* unrelated symbols: most real data files have some mutual information between symbols. One can do better than plain Huffman by &quot;decorrelating&quot; the symbols, and then using the Huffman algorithm on these decorrelated symbols.
* symbol-by-symbol: Several compression algorithms, such as range coding, give better compression than binary Huffman by relaxing the binary Huffman restriction that each input symbol must be encoded as an integer number of bits.
* known probability distribution: Usually the receiver does not know the exact probability distribution. So typical Huffman compression algorithms send a frequency table first, then send the compressed data. Several &quot;adaptive&quot; compression algorithms, such as Polar tree coding, can get better compression than Huffman because they converge on the probability distribution, or adapt to a changing probability distribution, without ever explicitly sending a frequency table.

This is reminiscent of the the way many algorithms compress files smaller than the &quot;optimum&quot; Fixed Bit Length Encoding codeword length&lt;ref&gt;
[http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Fixed_Bit_Length_Encoding NES development: Fixed Bit Length Encoding]
&lt;/ref&gt;
by exploiting the caveat in the Fixed Bit Length Encoding optimality proof:

Fixed Bit Length Encoding is optimal for symbol-by-symbol coding into fixed-length codewords of a stream of symbols with a known finite alphabet size A.
The optimum codeword length for Fixed Bit Length Encoding is
&lt;math&gt;L = \left \lceil log_2 A \right \rceil&lt;/math&gt;.
* finite alphabet: Fixed Bit Length Encoding is useless for infinite alphabets; &quot;universal codes&quot; (described below) handle such alphabets easily.
* symbol-by-symbol: Several compression algorithms, such as LZW, have fixed-length codewords with better compression than Fixed Bit Length Encoding, by using some codewords to represent symbol pairs or longer strings of symbols.
* fixed-length codewords: variable-length codes often give better compression.

== prefix codes ==

Huffman coding, Shannon-Fano coding, and Polar tree coding all map some relatively small known alphabet of symbols to prefix codes.

&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;universal codes&quot; map an infinitely large known alphabet -- often the set of all positive integers, or the set of all integers -- to prefix codes.

=== universal codes ===

There are many &quot;universal codes&quot;, a kind of prefix code.

Any particular prefix code (including any universal code) can be seen as a kind of Huffman code for a particular corresponding frequency distribution.

Typical audio data, and typical audio data prediction residues, have approximately Laplacian distribution.
Prediction error coding for image compression and geometry compression typically produces an approximately Laplacian distribution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pajarola&quot; /&gt;
Encoding a Laplacian distribution with a general Huffman code gives a prefix code equivalent to using a Golomb code.
The Golomb code is much simpler and faster than a general Huffman code to compress and decompress.
If the audio data is &quot;close enough&quot; to a Laplacian distribution, a Golomb code may give even better net compression than a general Huffman code, because a Golomb decoder requires a smaller overhead of 1 parameter, while general Huffman decoder requires the overhead of a Huffman table of probabilities.

Rice coding is a subset of Golomb coding that is much faster to compress and decompress.
Because Rice codes closely approximate Huffman codes for a Laplacian distribution,
they compress almost as well as general Huffman codes.

&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical audio data, and typical audio data prediction residues (after decorrelating), have approximately Laplacian distribution, and so they are often decoded with a Golomb decoder or Rice decoder rather than a general Huffman decoder.

Some audio decoders can be told to use Rice decoders during passages of music that compress well with them, and later told to switch to some other decoder during passages of music (such as pure sine wave tones, or all values equally probable white noise) that don't compress well with Rice decoders.

In some audio applications, in particular 2-way telephone-like communication, end-to-end latency is critical.
The recommended maximum time delay for telephone service is 150 milliseconds{{fact}}([[Wikipedia:1 E-1 s]]).
This rules out many popular compression algorithms.
We discuss latency in more detail in the [[Data_Compression/Evaluating_Compression_Effectiveness#latency]] section of this book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Asymmetric Compression==

The idea of Asymmetric Compression is quite simple, given a method of processing compression in such a way as to continually improve the compression ratio{{fact}}, A server would be able to pack the data into a tighter and tighter file structure{{fact}}, while replacing the data with a series of instructions that would then recover the data more quickly and in fewer steps. An example of this might be a program that tries different combinations of order injection or entropy injection until it finds the one that allows the greatest compression. Then incorporates a signifier that allows the decompression system to find the exact order/entropy injection used so that it can reverse the effects once the new compression step is completed, as part of the decompression algorythm.
&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.mattmahoney.net/dc/dce.html#Section_1 &quot;Data Compression Explained&quot;] by Matt Mahoney:
&quot;In particular, it is not possible to compress random data or compress recursively.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept is attractive to the server industry, however so far no such algorythm has become practical.

----

When a data compression algorithm takes about the same time to generate a compressed file as it does to uncompress that file, we call that algorithm &quot;symmetric&quot;.

When a data compression algorithm takes much longer to generate a compressed file than it does to uncompress a file, we call that algorithm &quot;asymmetric&quot;.

''(Are there any cases where a data compression algorithm takes much *less* time to generate a compressed file than it does to uncompress the file?)''

----

All video compression algorithms use asymmetric compression.

In particular, motion compensation is notorious for requiring a lot of time on the compression side.
To get the best compression, the motion compensation subroutine during compression must compare every 16x16 block of pixels in the current frame with every 16x16 block of pixels in the previous frame, which takes many, many comparisons, and figure out which block of the previous frame gives the best match.
During decompression, the motion compensation routine takes the coordinates of the &quot;best match&quot; from the compressed data stream, and copies the data from that location in the previous frame to the current 16x16 block of pixels in the current frame.

There are many computers that are plenty fast enough to play back motion-compensated compressed video in real time, but not quite fast enough to motion-compensate and compress video in real time.
If you have such a computer, and you want to compress video, you can either:
* upgrade to a faster computer, one fast enough to do compression with full motion compensation in real time at high compression.
* use your slow computer to compress it in &quot;batch mode&quot; much slower than real time (perhaps overnight). Do all the same operations as that fast computer, resulting in a bit-for-bit identical compressed video file.
* use your slow computer, but do less work -- perhaps compare each 16x16 block of pixels with only a small neighborhood around the corresponding block in the previous frame. Since this slower computer does less work per frame, perhaps it will be fast enough to keep up with the video in real time. But because it doesn't do an exhaustive search for the &quot;best&quot; match, it doesn't compress as well, resulting in a larger compressed video file.

== Lossy Compression vs Non-Lossy Compression ==
Lossy image compression and lossy video compression (such as JPEG compression, MPEG compression, and fractal image compression) give much better reduction in size (much higher [[Data Compression/Evaluating Compression Effectiveness#Evaluating Compression Ratio | compression ratio]]) than we find in almost any other area of data compression.

Lossy compression is best used to reduce the size of video data, where defects in the picture can be hidden as long as the general structure of the picture remains intact. This type of compression is called lossy compression because part of the reason that it compresses so well is that actual data from the video image, is lost and then replaced with some approximation.

Fractal compression is based on the concept of self-similarity in fractals. It uses fractal components that have self-similarity to the rest of the surrounding area in the picture.

The storage is so inaccurate that by replacing some of the fractal data with encrypted text, it is very difficult to see a difference in the picture, which means that important messages can be embedded in video images with little fear of detection.
{{fact}}

If we could achieve the same level of compression without loss of data, we wouldn't use Lossy Compression because there is an imperceptible loss of quality in the image.

One of the reasons that there is still some interest in new loss-less compression techniques, is that only very inexact data structures can survive Lossy Compression. It is often the case that loss of a single bit, renders a whole phrase or line of data inaccurate. This is why we attempt to build more and more stable memory systems. The recent shift from RD to SD ram for instance was partially because RD ram needed more interactive maintenance of its data.

If we are so protective of the memory of data, then it makes sense that we must also be protective of the compression scheme we use to store and retrieve data. So the only places Lossy Compression can be used, are places where the accuracy at the bit level, does not materially affect the quality of the data.

== image compression ==
Most image compression and video compression algorithms have 4 layers:
''Is there a standard terminology for these things?''
* A &quot;modeling&quot; or &quot;pre-conditioning&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;roelofs&quot;&gt;
Greg Roelofs.      
[http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/book/chapter09.html &quot;PNG: The Definitive Guide: Chapter 9. Compression and Filtering&quot;].
&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;filtering&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;roelofs&quot; /&gt; or &quot;de-correlation&quot; layer converts the raw pixels into more abstract information about the pictures -- and, at the decoder, a &quot;rendering&quot; part converts that abstract information back into the raw pixels. 
* A &quot;quantizer&quot; layer that throws away some of the details in that abstract information that humans are unlikely to notice -- and, at the decoder, a &quot;dequantizer&quot; that restores an approximation of the information.
* A &quot;entropy coder&quot; layer that compresses and packs each piece of information into the bitstream to be transmitted -- and, at the decoder, the &quot;entropy decoder&quot; that accepts the bitstream and unpacks each piece of information.
* A layer that adds synchronization, interleaving, and error detection to the raw bitstream just before transmitting it.

Since we talk about entropy coding elsewhere in this book, and the [[Data Coding Theory]] book discusses synchronization and error detection, this section will focus on the other layers.

Some kinds of &quot;modeling&quot; process gives us information that is useful for things other than data compression, such as &quot;de-noising&quot; and &quot;resolution enhancement&quot;.

Some popular &quot;modeling&quot; or  &quot;de-correlation&quot; algorithms include:

* delta encoding
* Fourier transform -- calculated using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) -- in particular, the discrete cosine transform (DCT)
* wavelet transform -- calculated using a fast wavelet transform (FWT) -- in particular, some discrete wavelet transform (DWT)
* motion compensation
* matching pursuit
* fractal transform&lt;ref&gt;

There is a huge amount of information in a raw, uncompressed movie.
All movie and image compression algorithms can be categorized as either:
* Lossless methods: methods that make no changes whatsoever to the image; the uncompressed image is bit-for-bit identical to the original.
* &quot;Nondegrading methods&quot; or &quot;transparent methods&quot;: methods that make some minor changes to the image; the uncompressed image is not exactly bit-for-bit identical, but the changes are (hopefully) invisible to the human eye.
* &quot;Degrading methods&quot; or &quot;low-quality methods&quot;: methods that introduce visible changes to the image.

... &quot;idempotent&quot; one-time loss vs. &quot;generational&quot; loss at every iteration ...

In theory, a &quot;perfectly&quot; compressed file (of any kind) should have no remaining patterns.
Many people working compression algorithms make pictures of the compressed data as if it were itself an image.
&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.cartesianinc.com/Tech/tech-overview.html &quot;Technical Overview of Cartesian Perceptual Compression&quot;]
(c) 1998-1999 Cartesian Products, Inc.
&lt;/ref&gt;
The human visual system is very sensitive to (some kinds of) patterns in data.
If a human can describe a repeating pattern in the compressed data precisely enough, you can use that description to help model the original image more accurately, leading to a smaller compressed image file.

Alas, in situations where there is no pattern at all (true random data),
the human eye often sees &quot;clumps&quot; and other &quot;patterns&quot; that are not useful for data compression.
(Some artists take randomly-positioned data and carefully nudge the points to make them more evenly spaced to make them ''look'' random,
but the result is actually less random and can often be compressed at least a little, unlike true random data).

=== DCT ===
[[File:Dctjpeg.png|thumb|219px|The two-dimensional &quot;basis functions&quot; of the JPEG DCT.]]

Standard JPEG uses a (lossy) discrete cosine transform (DCT),
and standard MP3 uses a (lossy) modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT).
The difference between the original input and the decoded output caused by these standard transforms
are smaller than the errors caused by quantization,
which in turn are generally so small as to be imperceptible.

=== integer transforms ===

Several wavelet transforms use only integer coefficients,
such as the ones used in Progressive Graphics File (PGF), lossless JPEG 2000, CineForm, ICER, etc.

A few DCT-like transforms have only integer coefficients,
such as
the MPEG integer IDCT standard,&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.reznik.org/software.html#IDCT
&lt;/ref&gt;
the 4×4 and 8×8 integer transforms used in H.264,
and the 4x4 transform used in JPEG XR.

Most of these transforms were originally developed so they would run quickly on embedded systems --
systems where the floating-point transforms used by standard JPEG/MPEG run too slowly.


In 2012, compression researcher Rock Brentwood posted several lossless approximations to the 1D DCT and IDCT, including the following:&lt;ref&gt;

=== JPEG ===
The JPEG data compression algorithm and file format are extensively covered in the wikibook [[JPEG - Idea and Practice]].

{{TODO|Provide some general notions and any specifics regarding the JPEG compression}}

=== JFIF: JPEG File Interchange Format ===

{{TODO|Extend}}

=== JPEG 2000 ===
JPEG 2000 is useful in applications that require very high quality -- such as the DICOM medical image format -- because the compressor can choose higher quality settings -- including a completely lossless mode -- than are available in earlier JPEG standards.

JPEG 2000 is a image coding system based on wavelet technology.
&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.jpeg.org/jpeg2000/ Joint Photographic Experts Group : JPEG 2000 standard]
&lt;/ref&gt;
The JPEG 2000 compression standard uses the biorthogonal CDF 5/3 wavelet (also called the LeGall 5/3 wavelet) for lossless compression and a CDF 9/7 wavelet for lossy compression.
However, a variety of other kinds of wavelets have been proposed and used in experimental data compression algorithms.
&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.wavelet.org/ The Wavelet Discussion Forum]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Open-source implementations of JPEG 2000 are available.

== color transformation ==

Most image compression algorithms use some kind of color space transformation
to de-correlate the R, G, B values of each pixel.
We discuss color transforms in [[Data_Compression/Multiple_transformations#color_transforms]].

== audio compression ==
Compression as we have seen does not depend only on the algorithm that is applied, but to the type of data that is intended compressed and to the quality of the copy generated at decompression time. This as covered in the previous section is extremely important to images but is also for sound. 

One important fact that distinguish sound from image is that the general public does not have in general the capacity to make a qualified distinction regarding audio, by the general subjectiveness of the sense and for lack of education in regards to the intrinsics of an complex audio production.

{{TODO|Cover dynamic range - 'Loudness Wars' and distinguish sound wave compression vs data compression}}

Today due to the increasing importance of digital transferences of audio files. That seems finally to have gotten the support of the music media conglomerates, the importance of quality in regards to the consumer is of extreme importance.

=== mp3 ===
Mp3 classifies not only a type of compression but a data format. It is used for lossy compression of audio and as a facilitator for digital audio distribution and categorization.

Most people will not be unable differentiate between an original (natural audio) and a 256kbps mp3 lossy reproduction.

An audio file that undergoes heavily sound compression when applied to a mp3 compressions, will generally sound worse to the human ear that the original, especially if encoded at 128 kbps (or less).

=== AAC ===
AAC is used mainly by Apple, sometimes encoded with the apple lossless audio codec (ALAC), however AAC is compatible with a huge range of non-Apple devices; see Wikipedia's page on AAC

{{TODO|ADD FURTHER INFORMATION}}

=== FLAC ===
FLAC uses lossless compression.

{{TODO|Complete}}

== lossy and residual give lossless ==
Sometimes people download a (highly compressed) image or video or music file, using it to decide if they really want to spend a (much longer) time downloading the high-resolution lossless version of the file.

Rather than delete the original (lossy) version of the file and start downloading the lossless version from scratch, several people are experimenting with methods of somehow using the partial information in the lossy version of the file in order to reduce the time required to download &quot;residue&quot;, also called the &quot;residual&quot; -- the &quot;rest&quot; of the file (i.e., fill in the details that the lossy compressor discarded).

As long as the size of the (compressed) residue is significantly less than the size of the file stored in a stand-alone lossless format, the user has saved time -- even though the total lossy + residue size is usually larger than a stand-alone lossless format.

      <comment>yet more highly compressed data differencing algorithms</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Inference Compression==

The idea behind ''inference compression'' is that since the algorithm and its creators do not previous knowledge about the source data but compression can be optimized to different types of data, they will base the compression on a process of type inference. This process is mostly dynamic and non-deterministic consisting in reading part of the source data into a buffer (sniff) and execute some tests to infer its type/characteristics as to decide what compression algorithm to apply. This selection is often rule based (pre-defined on the algorithm).

This of course permits some latitude on how to perform the inference, some algorithms can use for instance the file extension (if present) or even by the file header alone (using file type identifiers like [[w:Magic number (programming)|magic numbers]] or [[w:List of file signatures|file designator strings]]), to recognize some well known file formats. They will then use that information to optimize the guessing process to determine the best compression scheme. An example might be the LHA and LHZ compression algorithms that contain a number of compression rules, permitting dynamic optimization in response to rule-base differentiation of the different file types.

Depending on some limitations and requirements (speed and memory utilization for instance), the rule base selection can be dynamic, for instance based in an ''asymmetric compression'' scheme, that will allow for multiple inferences, and let them compete to see which compression scheme will do the best job of compressing the data. 

The idea is that the more closely you can infer the type of file, the more tightly you can compress it with a compression rule based particularly on that type of data. By tuning to the exact nature of the data, compression can often generate files that are significantly smaller than techniques which only approximate the type of data. For instance, a compression scheme that assumes Shakespearean text -- lots of common English words -- will probably not deal well with stock market tables -- rows of data showing the ticker symbol of a company, its closing price, etc.

== Markov models ==

We discuss Markov models in more detail in a later chapter, [[../Markov models/]].

== data differencing ==

Data compression can be viewed as a special case of data differencing.&lt;ref&gt;
{{wikipedia|data differencing}} [[w:data differencing]]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Just as data compression involves 2 processes that often run on 2 different machines -- the &quot;data compressor&quot; and the &quot;data expander&quot; --
data differencing involves 2 processes that often run on 2 different machines -- the &quot;differ&quot; and the &quot;patcher&quot;, respectively.

Some algorithms and programs used in data differencing are very similar to algorithms used in &quot;small-window compression&quot; (aka traditional data compression) --
such as &quot;large-window compression&quot; (aka &quot;data folding&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;IZO&quot; /&gt;) --
while others are very different --
such as &quot;data de-duplication&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
Dutch T. Meyer and William J. Bolosky.
[https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/fast11/tech/full_papers/Meyer.pdf &quot;A Study of Practical Deduplication&quot;].
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[[Wikipedia: data deduplication]]
&lt;/ref&gt;
and the rsync algorithm.

A few algorithms used in traditional data compression of large files
are similar to data differencing algorithms --
such as some techniques for storing many Huffman frequency tables described in 
[[Data Compression/Order/Entropy#Dynamic Huffman: storing the frequency table | Huffman: storing the frequency table]].

Some algorithms and programs developed for data differencing include:
* diff (&quot;[[w: delta compression]]&quot;)
* rsync
* rdiff
* lzip
* rzip
* IZO (Information Zipping Optimizer)&lt;ref name=&quot;IZO&quot;&gt;
http://static.usenix.org/event/lisa08/tech/full_papers/smith/smith_html/
&lt;/ref&gt;
* xdelta&lt;ref&gt;
http://code.google.com/p/xdelta/
&lt;/ref&gt;
* bsdiff 4 and bspatch&lt;ref name=&quot;percival&quot;&gt;
&quot;By using suffix sorting (specifically, Larsson and Sadakane's qsufsort) and taking advantage of how executable files change, bsdiff routinely produces binary patches 50-80% smaller than those produced by Xdelta, and 15% smaller than those produced by .RTPatch ...
A far more sophisticated algorithm, which typically provides roughly 20% smaller patches, is described in my doctoral thesis.&quot; --

&lt;/ref&gt;

With other forms of compression, more information generally gives better compression.
However, experiments by Factor, Sheinwald, and Yassour 2001 seem to indicate that,
when using data differencing with LZ77-like compression,
trying to use a large collection of shared files that resemble the target file
often gives worse compression than using a single reference file from that collection.&lt;ref name=&quot;shapira&quot; /&gt;

=== pre-loaded dictionary ===

When compressing very large files, it usually doesn't make much difference exactly what the dictionary is pre-loaded to,
so many systems start with an empty dictionary.

However, pre-loading the dictionary can produce significantly smaller files in two cases:
* when compressing lots of short strings, or
* when data differencing -- compressing some big file that is almost the same as some file the receiver already has.

Some implementations of data compression algorithms already have support for pre-loading the dictionary.
* The popular zlib compression library supports deflateSetDictionary() and inflateSetDictionary() functions for pre-loading the dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.gzip.org/zlib/manual.html#deflateSetDictionary
http://www.gzip.org/zlib/manual.html#inflateSetDictionary
&lt;/ref&gt;


One possible approach to data differencing involves tweaking some compression algorithm
to &quot;pre-load&quot; its internal data structures (it's &quot;window&quot; or &quot;dictionary&quot;)
with data from the files we already have,
to allow the compression algorithm to use that data
to (hopefully) give better compression on the next file.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7261538/can-compression-algorithm-learn-on-set-of-files-and-compress-them-better &quot;Can compression algorithm “learn” on set of files and compress them better?&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/comp.compression/0ehjywenaIo comp.compression: &quot;Employing a set of data files guaranteed to be available at the time of decompression&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the 
IPSW algorithm (the in-place sliding window of Shapira and Storer)
initializes the source sliding window of a LZ77-like decompressor to some shared file S,&lt;ref name=&quot;shapira&quot; &gt;
Dana Shapira and James A. Storer.
[http://pages.cs.brandeis.edu/~shapird/publications/CompJournal2005-06-02.pdf &quot;In Place Differential File Compression&quot;].
2005.
&lt;/ref&gt;
allowing common substrings of the target file T to be copied out of S,
as well as the (like other LZ77-like compressors) allowing repeated substrings
to be copied from previously-decompressed parts of the target file T,
or if all else fails, from literal values in the compressed file.

Sometimes such &quot;pre-loading&quot; implementations
use unmodified &quot;small-window compression&quot; algorithm,
as in [http://www.google.com/patents/USRE41152 US Patent RE41152 2010].
Many early compression algorithms pre-loaded the dictionary with a &quot;static dictionary&quot;
(Huffword, PalmDoc, etc.).
The LZW algorithm gives better compression than the very similar LZ78 algorithm.
One way of thinking about LZW is to imagine that the 256 literal byte values
are not a separate &quot;special case&quot;, but are, in effect, pre-loaded into the dictionary;
while the LZ78 algorithm, in effect, starts with an empty dictionary,
and so gives worse compression.

With many compression algorithms, such pre-loading is limited by a &quot;window&quot; or &quot;history limit&quot; --
when the window or limit is, say, 32 kByte,
it doesn't matter what or how much data you try to pre-load,
only the last 32 kByte is going to make any difference.

This leads some people working on data differencing to use
a window or history limit much larger than other compression researchers.

=== window size ===

The LZ77-style decompressors have a fixed-size &quot;window&quot; of recently-decompressed text,
and the &quot;copy references&quot; can only refer to text inside that window.

Many compression algorithms, in theory, have no inherent &quot;history limit&quot; --
such as LZ78-style algorithms and adaptive Huffman algorithms.
However, in practice, most implementations of compression algorithms periodically reset their dictionary and start fresh.
So they have a block size the length of the maximum text between dictionary resets.

With many early compression algorithms, an easy way to improve performance is to increase the window size.
(i.e., either literally increase the &quot;window&quot; buffer for LZ77 algorithms,
or simply reset the dictionary less often for LZ78-style algorithms).
These early compression algorithms were typically developed on machines that had far less RAM
than modern machines,
and so the &quot;window size&quot;, the &quot;reset frequency&quot;, and &quot;internal dictionary size&quot;
were constrained by that limit.
(Those early machines also ran much slower than modern machines,
and many algorithms -- such as the LZRW series of algorithms --
were heavily constrained by these speed limits;
it is unclear what effect this had on dictionary size).

For simplicity, we will consider the effect of doubling the window size on a variety of algorithms.
The original &quot;small window&quot; algorithm has some fixed window size W,
and the widened &quot;larger window&quot; algorithm has some fixed window size 2*W,
which can be thought of as the &quot;near window&quot; with all the same stuff in it as used by the small-window algorithm,
and the &quot;far window&quot; that has stuff that is inaccessible to the small-window algorithm,
but perhaps the larger-window algorithm can exploit that stuff to get better compression.

Alas, there are diminishing returns to
increasing the size of the window.
In fact, almost always there is some data-dependent &quot;optimum&quot; window size.
Increasing the size of the window beyond the optimum leads to worse compression (larger compressed files).

There are 4 reasons that windows larger than that optimum size are counter-productive:

1. Some LZ77-style algorithms use a fixed-length linear offset. Doubling the size of the window necessarily increases the length of each and every copy item by 1 bit.
With typical 16-bit copy items, that makes the compressed file longer (worse compression) by a factor of 17/16,
unless the compressor can find strings in the far window with matches that are longer than any strings in the near window.

2. Other LZ77-style algorithms use variable-length offsets. Typically more distant offsets are longer.
Doubling the size of the window generally leaves the length of &quot;extremely close&quot; copy items exactly the same,
increases the size of a few copy items near the outer limit of the near window by 1 bit,
and requires even larger copy items to refer to stuff in the far window.
So there's hardly any penalty for increasing the window size for this (2) category compared to the (1) category.
However, the wins are not quite as good.
In many cases, even when there is an excellent long match in the far window, longer than any match in the near window,
it doesn't make the compressed file any smaller --
the long copy item needed to refer to that distant matching string
may be the same length or even longer than
two short copy items that can re-assemble that same string
from two places in the near window.

3. As Jeff J. Kato et al point out,&lt;ref&gt;
Jeff J. Kato, David W. Ruska, David J. Van Maren.
US Patent 4847619
[http://www.google.com/patents/US4847619 &quot;Performance-based reset of data compression dictionary&quot;].
1987.
&lt;/ref&gt;
It can even be counter-productive to have
data from one kind of file in the window/dictionary
when trying to compress data with somewhat different characteristics,
or when trying to compress a file whose characteristics change (&quot;evolve&quot;)
from one part to the next.
Often it's better to reset the dictionary
and start from scratch.

However, sometimes these &quot;large window&quot; compressors
have great gains --
in particular, when we're currently trying to compress a file
that is not merely the same kind of file,
but is bit-for-bit identical to some early file.
Some large-window techniques also work well when a file is *mostly* identical
with relatively few edits here and there.

The default window size or block size for some compression software is:
* gzip: 32 kByte sliding window
* bzip2: blocks of 900 kB
* DEFLATE (as used in &quot;.zip&quot;, &quot;.jar&quot;, &quot;.png&quot;, etc.): 32 kByte sliding window
* The GIF standard mentions two kinds of LZW encoders:
** some GIF encoder implementations reset the dictionary every time it gets full --
i.e., the compressor sends the &quot;clear code&quot; to reset the dictionary after every (max dictionary size - number of hard-wired entries) = 2048-(256+2) compressed symbols.
** All GIF decoders are required to support &quot;deferred clear&quot;. Many images can be stored in a smaller .gif compressed file if the compressor uses such a &quot;deferred clear&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

The GIF LZW encoder becomes non-adaptive after the dictionary is full, while it is &quot;waiting&quot; for the next clear code.

'''New York City-style pizza''' originated in New York City in the early 1900s, and may be the American style pizza which most closely resembles that of Naples, Italy. It's characterized by wide, thin, foldable slices. The traditional toppings were limited to tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese. Additional toppings always included cheese. The slices are often eaten as a street snack while folded in half, as its size and flexibility sometimes makes it unwieldy to eat flat.

The most notable difference between New York style and other American pizzas is its thin hand-tossed crust, made from a high-gluten bread flour and its light coating of pre-cooked tomato sauce. The flavor of the crust has sometimes been attributed to the minerals present in the New York City tap water used to make the dough.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Sara. [http://www.slashfood.com/2005/09/26/new-york-pizza-is-the-water-the-secret/ &quot;New York Pizza: is the water the secret?&quot;]. ''Slashfood''. Weblogs, Inc. September 26, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Some out-of-state pizza makers even transport the water cross-country for the sake of authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, Rupert. [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/new-yorks-champagne-tap-water-under-threat-408724.html &quot;New York's 'Champagne Tap Water' Under Threat&quot;]. ''The Independent UK'' July 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wayne, Gary. [http://www.seeing-stars.com/Dine/MulberryPizza.shtml &quot;Mulberry Street Pizzeria&quot;]. ''Seeing Stars in Hollywood''. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

New York-style pizza is usually sold both by the slice and as whole pies.  Slices are taken from a large pie — typically around 18 inches in diameter — and most commonly cut into 8 slices, but other variations do exist.  Pizzas to be sold by the slice can be either &quot;plain&quot; (sometimes &quot;regular&quot; — cheese and sauce) or with toppings.  While many New York pizzerias also have slices with various toppings ready to serve, they invariably have plain slices ready to go, and can provide slices with toppings by adding them on prior to re-heating.

Pizzas are typically served with condiments such as dried red chili pepper, garlic powder, and grated parmesan cheese, available for the customer to place on the pizza once served. Oregano is also sometimes available.

Square-shaped slices with much thicker dough called Sicilian slices are also sold in New York City, though they often differ considerably from the true pizza of Sicily.

==Ingredients==
*1 teaspoon active dry [[cookbook:yeast|yeast]]
*2/3 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C) 
*2 cups all-purpose [[cookbook:flour|flour]]
*1 teaspoon [[cookbook:salt|salt]]  
*2 tablespoons [[cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] 
*1 (10 ounce) can [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato sauce]] 
*1 pound shredded  [[cookbook:mozzarella|mozzarella]] cheese 
*1/2 cup grated Romano cheese 
*1/4 cup chopped fresh [[cookbook:basil|basil]] 
*1 tablespoon dried [[cookbook:oregano|oregano]] 
*1 teaspoon red pepper flakes

==Procedure==
#Sprinkle the yeast over the surface of the warm water in a large bowl. Let stand for 1 minute, then stir to dissolve. 
#Mix in the flour, salt and olive oil. 
#When the dough is too thick to stir, turn out onto a floured surface, and knead for 5 minutes. Knead in a little more flour if the dough is too sticky. 
#Place into an oiled bowl, cover, and set aside in a warm place to rise until doubled in bulk. 
#Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). If using a pizza stone, preheat it in the oven as well, setting it on the lowest shelf. 
#When the dough has risen, flatten it out on a lightly floured surface. 
#Roll or stretch out into a 12 inch circle, and place on a baking pan. If you are using a pizza stone, you may place it on a piece of parchment while preheating the stone in the oven. 
#Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough. Sprinkle with oregano, mozzarella cheese, basil, Romano cheese and red pepper flakes. 
#Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until the bottom of the crust is browned when you lift up the edge a little, and cheese is melted and bubbly. 
#Cool for about 5 minutes before slicing and serving.

==Notes, Tips, and Variations==
You may also want to use additional toppings for your pizza. Well-known suggestions include:
*4 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese (for an extra cheese pizza)
*2 to 4 ounces sliced [[Cookbook:Pepperoni|pepperoni]]
*8 ounces Italian [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]], casings removed, crumbled, and cooked
*2 to 4 ounces sliced Genoa [[Cookbook:Salami|salami]]
*1 medium-sized fresh [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]], cut into strips
*1 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], sliced and lightly sautéed
*1 can sliced [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushroom]]s or mushroom stems and pieces, drained
*1 can sliced black [[Cookbook:Olive|olive]]s, drained
*2 to 4 ounces thickly sliced, diced [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]]
*2 to 4 ounces sliced, cooked [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]], cut into pieces
If you want to use more than one topping, you may want to cut down on the amount of each topping used.

If you want to make your pizza more crispy, bake your pizza in the oven at its maximum temperature, usually ranging from 500 to 550 degrees F (260 to 290 degrees C). Bake the pizza for 9 to 12 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.

      <comment>/* Creating the Object List */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[SwisTrack/Components/IDReaderRing|IDReaderRing]] component in SwisTrack can read a circular barcode around a blob. The implementation assumes that there is a white blob in the middle that can be detected with a standard blob detection algorithm, and a gray-black bar code around. This example contains Matlab code to create such barcode blobs, and information on how to use it.

== Creating a new Set of Blobs ==

The Matlab scripts for creating blobs are located in the ''CreateBarCodes'' folder. The following procedure will create bar codes:

* Create a list of symbols, e.g. with 14 chips and Hamming distance 4:
 symbollist=symbols(14, 4)
* (optional) Check the symbol distances:
 symboldistances(14, symbollist);
* (optional) Draw one symbol:
 drawsymbol(14, symbollist(1), 'Test')
* Draw (and save/export) all symbols:
 exportsymbols(14, symbollist, 'Test')

You may want to modify &quot;drawsymbol&quot; to change the size/proportions of the blob. The algorithm finds codes with 14 chips that are rotationally independent (i.e. no two codes are the same in any rotation), and have a Hamming distance of at least 4 chips (i.e. any two codes in any rotation differ by at least 4 chips). This is done in a heuristic fashion, and when running the algorithm several times, it may come up with a slightly different number of codes.

== Choosing the Right Number of Chips ==

The number of chips as well as the Hamming distance will greatly influence the number of available codes. There are a number of trade-offs involved, however:
* The more chips you use, the more codes you'll get.
* The bigger the Hamming distance, the fewer codes you'll get.
* The more chips you use, the more resolution you need (i.e. better camera resolution or bigger blobs on the camera image). This is a constraint imposed by the Nyquist criterion. As a rule of thumb, the image should be at least N by N pixels for a code with 0.7N chips.
* The bigger the Hamming distance, the more robust the detection/discrimination is going to be. 
Hence, you should find a configuration that provides about the number of blobs that you really need. One or two times more codes than you need is OK and may serve you as spare codes in case you'll need more at some later time, but if your configuration yields 10 or 100 times more codes, you unnecessarily trading off detection quality with number of codes.

== Creating the Object List ==

To create the list of bar codes, run ''exportsymbols.m'' for a full XML file with all your symbols, or modify existing ''robotlist.xml''. Optimally, you'd only enter the barcodes that you are using in your experiment here. The more barcodes the file contains, the longer it will take to detect the barcodes.

== Playing with the Detection Algorithm ==

To play around with the detection algorithm, there is a Matlab script available in the ''DetectionAlgorithm'' folder. 

== Practical Hints and Limitations ==

The current implementation assumes a perfectly circular barcode. On cameras with high distortions, this does not produce satisfactory results.

The inner radius of the ring should be chosen such that the blob in the center does not interfere in any case. As the blob is white, the algorithm will take it for a white chip. Especially if small deformations are expected, the distance between the barcode and the blob in the center (black ring) should be sufficiently big. The same might happen with the outer radius of the ring if the robot or floor is white. In this case, it helps adding a large black ring on the outside of the barcode.

The implementation is somewhat robust with respect to illumination (brightness average is removed), but will fail if there are reflections on the blob. This is usually not a problem with paper blobs, but could be an issue with plastic coated blobs.

In some cases, the white chips in the barcode ring are detected as blobs.
Some ways to fix that include: 
- Making the barcode grey-black instead of white-black, and put a white blob in the middle. The barcode discrimination quality will suffer slightly, but this is a OK in many cases.
- Keeping the barcode ring thin, and the blob in the center big. A threshold on the blob size will then filter out a few consecutive white chips and everything else that is too small to be a blob.

When using Bayer pattern color cameras, you might need a higher effective resolution to detect the barcode reliably.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Graphs are a useful tool for exploring economics, so we want to be able to use them in studying markets with network externalities. However, the simple graphs of downward-sloping demand which get us so far in many markets are misleading when studying a market with strong demand-side economies of scale. Here, we're going to figure out what demand would look like in such a market, so we can use the graphs to answer questions later.

== Influence of expected quantity ==
{{Noframeright|1=[[File:Network_externalities_expectation_vs_demand_01.svg]]|2=Figure 1: Actual quantity demanded (Q) at $50 given expected quantity (Q&lt;sup&gt;X&lt;/sup&gt;)}}

Start with the basic idea of network externalities: when more people consume a product, that product becomes more valuable to others. If we want to show this on a graph, we need to think carefully about exactly what we're showing, and what we want to leave off. To being with, we'll leave off price. Price is important, so we'll leave it off by holding it constant, say at p = $50. Now, that $50 is important, but it will be the same for everything on the graph so we can [[w:ceteris paribus|ceteris paribus]] ignore it for the time being.

What should go on the graph? We're concerned with how many people want to purchase the product, but how many people want to purchase it depends on how many people purchase it. Graphing quantity versus itself doesn't seem likely to be productive, but we can make a tweak and get somewhere with it. Rather than graphing quantity versus quantity, we'll graph '''expected quantity''' versus '''quantity demanded'''.

Figure 1 shows a typical demand for a good with strong network externalities. The expected quantity (Q&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;) is on the horizontal axis, and the actual quantity demanded (Q) is on the vertical axis. Q is given as a function of Q&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; and of price, but price is being held constant. Notice some things about the shape of the curve:
# '''When expected quantity is low, actual quantity demanded is zero.''' This isn't always true in products with network externalities, but often can be. Nobody wants to pay $50 for a telephone if there's nobody else on the network they're interested in talking to. We'll consider this a typical case, and look at exceptions later.
# '''Quantity demanded is increasing.''' The curve for quantity demanded is sloping upwards. As more people join the network, more people want to join the network.
# '''Quantity demanded is increasing at a decreasing rate.''' A bigger network is always better&lt;ref&gt;We're ignoring here the possibility of negative network externalities, or congestion.&lt;/ref&gt;, but it doesn't keep getting better as fast. When 20 people have a telephone, a new person joining the network is a big deal that increases the value of the network a lot. When 2 billion people have a telephone, one more person joining the network doesn't noticeably change the value for most telephone users. Since the value of the network doesn't change very much, it doesn't influence many more people to demand the product.

== Demand equilibrium ==
{{Noframeright|1=[[File:Network_externalities_expectation_vs_demand_overlay_02.svg]]|2=Figure 2: Equilibrium quantity demanded at a fixed price.}}

We see a complete curve of possible quantities at the given price, but not all of those quantities are reasonable, at least not in the long run. We need to think about the relationship between expectations and the actual quantity demanded. Suppose that the actual quantity demanded is greater than the expected quantity. Then more will be purchased and expectations will change to more closely match the reality. What if the actual quantity demanded is lower than the expected quantity? Eventually, consumers will notice that few people are purchasing the product and expectations will lower to match the reality.

We're concerned with these '''demand equilibrium''' points--the quantities where the expectations match the reality, and so expectations have no reason to change.

We can find these points graphically by overlaying a 45-degree line on the graph. In Figure 2, along the 45-degree line Q = Q&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;, but the line doesn't show demand equilibria itself because it may be that the actual amount that will be demanded is less or more. To identify the demand equilibria, look at where the 45-degree line intersects the demand curve. At these intersection points expectations don't need to change because they are correct and the actual quantity demanded for those expectations are the same as the expectations. Each of those overlapping spots is a demand equilibrium.

In Figure 2, with this kind of strong network externalities, there are 3 demand equilibria. These are labeled '''(L)''' for &quot;Low&quot;, '''(H)''' for &quot;High&quot;, and '''(C)''', which will be explained shortly. We now want to think more precisely about how the market might move if it's not at one of those equilibria.

&lt;gallery Caption=&quot;Figure 3: Market response to being out of demand equilibrium&quot; style=&quot;margin:0 4% 0 4%;&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; widths=&quot;380px&quot; heights=&quot;280px&quot;&gt;

Image:Network_externalities_expectation_vs_demand_dynamic_03.svg|Figure 3(c)
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Figure 3 shows three situations where the quantities are not at a demand equilibrium.
# In Figure 3(a), at the initial expectations, consumers will demand more. So the first arrow shows an increase in the quantity demanded. Expectations then need to catch up with this reality, so the second arrow shows expectations increasing until they reach the 45-degree line again where Q = Q&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;. At this expected quantity, a greater quantity is demanded, and so the third arrow shows the quantity demanded increasing again, and so forth toward demand equilibrium '''(H)'''.
# In Figure 3 (b), at the initial expectations, consumers will demand less. So the first arrow shows a decrease in the quantity demanded. Expectations then catch up by falling, so the second arrow shows expectations decreasing until they reach the 45-degree line, and so forth toward demand equilibrium '''(H)'''.
# In Figure 3 (c), just as in 3 (b), at the initial expectations, consumers will demand less. Quantity demanded and expectations decrease toward demand equilibrium '''(L)'''.

{{Noframeright|1=[[File:Network_externalities_expectation_vs_demand_dynamic_04.svg]]|2=Figure 4: General response to being out of demand equilibrium.}}

Figure 4 gives a shorthand in arrows for the dynamics shown in Figure 3. Overall, if expectations are below '''(C)''', the market will move to demand equilibrium  '''(L)'''. If expectations are above '''(C)''', the market will move to demand equilibrium  '''(H)''' (whether the market is originally between '''(C)''' and '''(H)''' or is greater than '''(H)''').

Points '''(L)''', '''(C)''' and '''(H)''' are all demand equilibria, but '''(C)''' has a different character. It's an '''unstable equilibrium'''. A small shift away from '''(C)''' on the low side will send the market toward '''(L)''' and a small shift away on the high side will send the market toward '''(H)'''.  We'll refer to '''(c)''' as the '''critical mass''' for the market. If the market can achieve the critical mass, then it should go to the high-quantity demand equilibrium, but if it falls short of the critical mass, it will fall to the low-quantity demand equilibrium (likely with quantity demanded being zero).

== Finding the demand curve ==
{{Noframeright|1=[[File:Network_externalities_construct_demand_01.svg]]|2=Figure 5: Constructing a demand curve for a product with network externalities.}}

&lt;!--[[Image:Network_externalities_construct_demand_01.svg]]--&gt;

In the previous section we found '''demand equilibria''', but those are only equilibria for a specific price. We want to be able to use demand curves as we usually do in economic analysis. Figure 5 shows how we can use the demand equilibria to find the demand curve.

Instead of a single price, we choose 3 different prices: p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and p&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, with p&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. When the price goes up, the quantity-demanded curve goes down, because--at any given expected quantity--people aren't willing to buy as much. This is shown on the top graph as three curves for each of the three prices.

For each of the prices, we find the three demand equilibria: the '''(L)''', '''(C)''' and '''(H)'''. The '''(L)''' in this example is always zero. It's marked with three points at p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and p&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The high demand has three levels for the three different prices, H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at price p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at p&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. We find those levels by finding the '''(H)''' demand equilibrium for each of the three prices, and tracing it down from the top graph to the bottom demand graph. As you'd expect on any typical demand graph, higher prices give you lower quantities demanded and ''this part'' of the demand curve slopes downward.

We similarly trace the critical mass for each of the three prices, and this gives us something different looking. The critical masses are marked as C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Rather than sloping down, '''the demand curve slopes up for the critical mass'''. At first that might seem to violate our economic intution, but recall it's the '''critical mass'''. We don't actually expect demand to ever be there. Instead, it's the dividing line between a network which will take off to '''(H)''' and one which will collapse to '''(L)'''. This is indicated by drawing that portion of the demand curve with a dotted line--it's part of the demand structure which we don't want to forget, but we shouldn't look at it to see what quantity will be purchased at any particular price. This portion of the demand curve slopes up because as the price rises, it's harder to convince people to join the network. The higher price turns them off of the network, but if a lot of other people are in the network, that compensates for the higher price.

== Using the demand curve ==
{{Noframeright|1=[[File:Network_externalities_demand_01.svg]]|2=Figure 5: Demand curve for a product with network externalities.}}

We will usually not look at the Q&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-vs-Q curves, and rely on demand curves such as the one derived in Figure 4. Figure 5 shows such a demand curve standing alone, with a particular price ''p''.&lt;ref&gt;Notice that the horizontal axis has both Q and Q&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; as its label. This is because in the process of constructing this demand curve, we assumed that the actual quantity demanded would equal the expected quantity.&lt;/ref&gt; '''At the price ''p''''', we can see three demand equilibria. '''(C)''' is the critical mass at price ''p'', so we don't expect that quantity to be demanded. '''(L)''' and '''(H)''' are two probable quantities which might be demanded at price ''p''.

Besides reading the two possible quantities demanded off the demand curve, we'll need to give thought to '''expectations''', since what consumers expect to occur can influence which of those quantities are actually realized. 

=== Shifts in demand ===

Similar to a demand curve for a typical good, if something happens to make the network good more attractive (possibly a technology improvement), the demand curve shifts up. If something happens to make it less attractive, the demand curve shifts down. When such shifts occur, they likely will leave the '''(L)''' &quot;low&quot; part of the curve unchanged.

&lt;!-- comment out the following while working on it
Notice the Quantity at b1 &lt; Q(b2) &lt; Q(b3). The important idea to draw from this is that as the price of the network is lowered, the quantity demanded needed to reach critical mass(the b points) is lower. 

The observation that c1 &gt; c2 &gt; c3 shows that as the price is lower, the larger the network will be if critical mass is reached.

Also still important is point a, regardless of the different fixed prices shown for the above network, if at any of the above price levels, critical mass isn't reached then they all still converge on to point a where the network won't exist.

The second graph shows a demand function for the network. The price levels P1,P2 and P3 correlated with points b1,c1; b2,c2; b3,c3. These are the same relations as depicted in the graph above it. This graph further illustrates that the lower price levels create a lower quantity needed to achieve critical mass for the network to succeed and transform to the stable equilibrium, the c points.--&gt;

=== Consumer surplus ===
A demand curve for a good with network externalities shows marginal willingness-to-pay for each potential quantity sold. In this way it is like a typical demand curve. However, because the demand curve for the product with network externalities shows '''demand equilibria''', the meaning is a little different. This difference is significant enough that reading consumer surplus off the demand curve becomes impossible.

It may help to consider a discrete example. We'll consider 6 possible consumers of a product with network externalities. Suppose each of them values the good even without network externalities, and that they all get the same benefit from network externalities, with the benefit equal Q, the size of the network.

Their values without network externalities are 7, 5, 7, 3, 7, and 1. We'll follow the traditional idea for constructing a demand schedule or &quot;curve&quot; (although since it's discrete it's not really a curve in this case), and order the consumers from those who value the good most highly to those who value it least. Then we can plot their WTP on a graph.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Consumer !! Value w/o network externalities !! Q !! Value including Q
|-
| 1|| 7|| 1|| 7+1 = 8
|-
| 2|| 7|| 2|| 7+2 = 9
|-
| 3|| 7|| 3|| 7+3 = 10
|-
| 4|| 5|| 4|| 5+4 = 9
|-
| 5|| 3|| 5|| 3+5 = 8
|-
| 6|| 1|| 6|| 1+6 = 7
|}
[[File:CS_discrete_demand_net_effects_01.svg]]

The graph shows the value (WTP) for each of the six consumers. '''If we could read willingness-to-pay from this graph in the same way as a typical demand graph (which we can't)''', we could see that at a price of 6, the first consumer has a surplus of 8-6, the second of 9-6, etc. Adding up the differences for all the consumers, we would find a consumer surplus of 15.

This is wrong, though. The actual consumer surplus (which we can figure out from our original description, but not from the graph) is 30. The reason can be figured out from the first consumer. Their value for the good is 7+Q, where Q is the number of other people purchasing the good. When we draw the demand curve, each point on the curve was a '''demand equilibrium''', so that expected quantity demanded and actual quantity demanded match. This is useful for drawing the demand curve, but it means the willingness-to-pay is only correct ''for that exact quantity''.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Q !! WTP
|-
| 1|| 7+1 = 8
|-
| 2|| 7+2 = 9
|-
| 3|| 7+3 = 10
|-
| 4|| 7+4 = 11
|-
| 5|| 7+5 = 12
|-
| 6|| 7+6 = 13
|}

This table shows the willingness-to-pay for the good depending on how many people actually purchased it. If the price was 6, and all 6 consumers decided to purchase the good, the WTP of the first consumer would be 13, instead of the 8 shown on the graph.

[[File:CS_discrete_demand_net_effects_02.svg]]

The green areas on the updated graph show the WTP if every consumer assumes that 6 people will be purchasing the product. Now we can find the consumer surplus by summing the difference between consumer's values and the price they pay. However, ''this is only correct'' if 6 consumers actually purchase the product. If fewer or more purchased the product, this would also give an incorrect consumer surplus value.

=== Efficiency in competitive equilibrium ===
If a product has no externalities, we generally find that the competitive equilibrium is efficient. There are a number of ways economists talk about this. One was is to point out that, in a competitive equilibrium, the marginal willingness-to-pay (from the demand curve) is the same as the marginal cost. Since usually the marginal willingness-to-pay (WTP) is falling and/or the marginal cost is rising with increasing quantity, this means that ...
# ... selling any less than the competitive equilibrium is inefficient, because at lower quantities the marginal willingness-to-pay is higher than the marginal cost, and
# ... selling any more than the competitive equilibrium is inefficient, because at higher quantities the marginal willingness-to-pay is lower than the marginal cost.

The part of that which remains true with (positive) network externalities is that in competitive equilibrium, the marginal willingness-to-pay equals the marginal cost. The part which is different is what happens when the quantity sold increases. If the competitive quantity sold is Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, where WTP = MC, and then the quantity sold '''increases''' to Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then the WTP for the Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sub&gt; unit increases due to the larger network benefits.

As an example, let's work with the demand from the consumer surplus section, and now suppose that the marginal cost is 9. In a competitive equilibrium, this would mean that 4 units would be sold at a price of 9.

== Some Variations ==

=== Stand-alone value ===
[[File:Network_effects_example_03.svg]]

This graph represents a slightly different network. As you can see there is only one equilibrium point and this point is stable. The curve, Q&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; starts above the 45 degree line, even when Q=0, and remains so until point c. Should Q become greater than point c, then people would leave the network until Q retreated to point c, where Q&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; = Q.

On the other end, when Q=0, Q&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; is still positive. This illustrates the idea that even when there is no current demand, or no one currently in the network. There is still value in the network and people will want to join, ultimately reaching point c. This is an alternative to above, in that there is no critical mass point to achieve, because of this expectations play a much smaller role, if at all, in reaching that desirable equilibrium point c.

=== Early adopters ===
[[File:Network_effects_example_04.svg]]

Our final example allows for a more realistic representation of a network.

This is more similar to the first example in that we have the usual equilibrium points, two stable, one unstable.
The part of the curve where the slope is equal to zero, There is some constant quantity that will be demanded given the quantity in that network until the point on the graph where the line begins sloping upward.

Should this network reach critical mass, expectations are just as important as in our first example. When the network reaches the unstable equilibrium, point b(assuming that expectations work to get us there), expectations come in to play again. At point b there will be a drive, market momentum, to move towards point a or c. In our other example point a represented a network failure. Here point a is in the positive coordinates, the network would exist at this point although it would be very small and certainly not as ideal as point c.

== Summary ==

Critical mass and it's importance has been hammered away at through analysis of the examples. Expectations management is a tool that allows a firm to reach these points in order for a network to be successful and feedback certainly plays in as well. The issue now lies within a firms ability to determine/estimate the type of demand structure their network would face should they decide to create their product/network. The following section will discuss networks themselves and the different structures networks may be formatted to. Although this is not the solving parameter to determine demand structure, it is another tool that if the firm fully understands what they are doing, they can aggregate the knowledge of the topics thus far to create a business strategy for their network/product.

==Events==
A event is a hook into a system that allows the execution of some code when the event occurs.
Events can be used to extend, integrate, debug, audit or monitor a system.

JPA defines several events for the persistent life-cycle of &lt;code&gt;Entity&lt;/code&gt; objects.
JPA events are defined through annotations or in the orm.xml.
Any method of a persistent class can be annotated with an event annotation to be called for all instances of that class.
An event listener can also be configured for a class using the [http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/persistence/EntityListeners.html &lt;code&gt;EntityListeners&lt;/code&gt;] annotation or &lt;code&gt;&lt;entity-listeners&gt;&lt;/code&gt; XML element.
The specified listener class does not need to implement any interface (JPA does not use the Java event model), it only needs to annotate its
methods with the desired event annotation.

JPA defines the following events:
* [http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/persistence/PostLoad.html &lt;code&gt;PostLoad&lt;/code&gt;] - Invoked after an &lt;code&gt;Entity&lt;/code&gt; is loaded into the persistence context (&lt;code&gt;EntityManager&lt;/code&gt;), or after a &lt;code&gt;refresh&lt;/code&gt; operation.
* [http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/persistence/PrePersist.html &lt;code&gt;PrePersist&lt;/code&gt;] - Invoked before the &lt;code&gt;persist&lt;/code&gt; operation is invoked on an &lt;code&gt;Entity&lt;/code&gt;.  Also invoked on &lt;code&gt;merge&lt;/code&gt; for new instances, and on cascade of a &lt;code&gt;persist&lt;/code&gt; operation.  The &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; of the object may not have been assigned, and code be assigned by the event.
* [http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/persistence/PostPersist.html &lt;code&gt;PostPersist&lt;/code&gt;] - Invoked after a new instance is persisted to the database.  This occurs during a &lt;code&gt;flush&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;commit&lt;/code&gt; operation after the database &lt;code&gt;INSERT&lt;/code&gt; has occurred, but before the transaction is committed.  It does not occur during the &lt;code&gt;persist&lt;/code&gt; operation.  The &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; of the object should be assigned.
* [http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/persistence/PreUpdate.html &lt;code&gt;PreUpdate&lt;/code&gt;] - Invoked before an instance is updated in the database.  This occurs during a &lt;code&gt;flush&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;commit&lt;/code&gt; operation after the database &lt;code&gt;UPDATE&lt;/code&gt; has occurred, but before the transaction is committed.  It does not occur during the &lt;code&gt;merge&lt;/code&gt; operation.
* [http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/persistence/PostUpdate.html &lt;code&gt;PostUpdate&lt;/code&gt;] - Invoked after an instance is updated in the database.  This occurs during a &lt;code&gt;flush&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;commit&lt;/code&gt; operation after the database &lt;code&gt;UPDATE&lt;/code&gt; has occurred, but before the transaction is committed.  It does not occur during the &lt;code&gt;merge&lt;/code&gt; operation.
* [http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/persistence/PreRemove.html &lt;code&gt;PreRemove&lt;/code&gt;] - Invoked before the &lt;code&gt;remove&lt;/code&gt; operation is invoked on an &lt;code&gt;Entity&lt;/code&gt;.  Also invoked for cascade of a &lt;code&gt;remove&lt;/code&gt; operation.  It is also invoked during a &lt;code&gt;flush&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;commit&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;orphanRemoval&lt;/code&gt; in JPA 2.0.
* [http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/persistence/PostRemove.html &lt;code&gt;PostRemove&lt;/code&gt;] - Invoked after an instance is deleted from the database.  This occurs during a &lt;code&gt;flush&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;commit&lt;/code&gt; operation after the database &lt;code&gt;DELETE&lt;/code&gt; has occurred, but before the transaction is committed.  It does not occur during the &lt;code&gt;remove&lt;/code&gt; operation.

===Example of Entity event annotations===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public class Employee {
  @Id
  private String uid;
  @Basic
  private Calendar lastUpdated;
  ...

  @PrePersist
  public void prePersist() {
    this.uid = UIDGenerator.newUUI();
    this.lastUpdated = Calendar.getInstance();
  }

  @PreUpdate
  public void preUpdate() {
    this.lastUpdated = Calendar.getInstance();
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example of EntityListener event annotations===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
@EntityListeners(EmployeeEventListener.class)
public class Employee {
  @Id
  private String uid;
  @Basic
  private Calendar lastUpdated;
  ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class EmployeeEventListener {
  @PrePersist
  public void prePersist(Object object) {
    Employee employee = (Employee)object;
    employee.setUID(UIDGenerator.newUUI());
    employee.setLastUpdated(Calendar.getInstance());
  }

  @PreUpdate
  public void preUpdate(Object object) {
    Employee employee = (Employee)object;
    employee.setLastUpdated(Calendar.getInstance());
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example of Entity event xml===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Employee&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Employee&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;pre-persist method-name=&quot;prePersist&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;pre-update method-name=&quot;preUpdate&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;uid&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;entity/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example of EntityListener event xml===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Employee&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Employee&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;entity-listeners&gt;
        &lt;entity-listener class=&quot;org.acme.EmployeeEventListener&quot;&gt;
            &lt;pre-persist method-name=&quot;prePersist&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;pre-update method-name=&quot;preUpdate&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/entity-listener&gt;
    &lt;/entity-listeners&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;uid&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;entity/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Default Entity Listeners===
It is also possible to configure a default Entity listener.  This listener will receive events for all of the Entity classes in the persistence unit.  Default listeners can only be defined through XML.

If a default Entity listener is defined, and a class wants to define its own listener, or does not want the default listener, this can be disabled using the [http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/persistence/ExcludeDefaultListeners.html &lt;code&gt;ExcludeDefaultListeners&lt;/code&gt;] annotation or &lt;code&gt;&lt;exclude-default-listeners&gt;&lt;/code&gt; XML element.

====Example default Entity listener xml====
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;entity-mappings version=&quot;2.0&quot;
        xmlns=&quot;http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence/orm&quot;
        xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;
        xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence/orm orm_2_0.xsd&quot;&gt;
    &lt;persistence-unit-metadata&gt;
        &lt;persistence-unit-defaults&gt;
            &lt;entity-listeners&gt;
                &lt;entity-listener class=&quot;org.acme.ACMEEventListener&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;pre-persist method-name=&quot;prePersist&quot;/&gt;
                    &lt;pre-update method-name=&quot;preUpdate&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;/entity-listener&gt;
            &lt;/entity-listeners&gt;
        &lt;/persistence-unit-defaults&gt;
    &lt;/persistence-unit-metadata&gt;
&lt;/entity-mappings&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Events and Inheritance===
Entity listeners are inherited.  If a subclass does not wish to inherit a superclass Entity listener, then it must define the [http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/persistence/ExcludeSuperclassListeners.html &lt;code&gt;ExcludeSuperclassListeners&lt;/code&gt;] annotation or &lt;code&gt;&lt;exclude-superclass-listeners&gt;&lt;/code&gt; XML element.

===Events and Embeddables===
JPA does not define any events for &lt;code&gt;Embeddable&lt;/code&gt;s.  Some JPA providers may allow defining events for &lt;code&gt;Embeddable&lt;/code&gt; objects.

===Extended Events===
The JPA events are only defined for the Entity life-cycle.  There are no EntityMangager events, or system level events.

Some JPA providers may provide additional events.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] / [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Provide an extended event mechanism.  Additional &lt;code&gt;Entity&lt;/code&gt; level events are defined through the &lt;code&gt;DescriptorEventListener&lt;/code&gt; API.  A session level event mechanism is also provided through the &lt;code&gt;SessionEventListener&lt;/code&gt; API.  The event objects also provide additional information including the database row and set of object changes.

==Views==
A database &lt;code&gt;VIEW&lt;/code&gt; is a virtual view of a table or query.  Views are useful for hiding the complexity of a table, set of tables, or data-set.

In JPA you can map to a &lt;code&gt;VIEW&lt;/code&gt; the same as a table, using the &lt;code&gt;@Table&lt;/code&gt; annotation.  You can then map each column in the view to your object's attributes.
Views are normally read-only, so object's mapping to views are normally also read-only.  In most databases views can also be updatable depending on how complex to query is that they encapsulate.  Even for complex queries database triggers can normally be used to update into the view.

Views can often be used in JPA to workaround mapping limitations.  For example if a table join is not supported by JPA, or a database function is desired to be called to transform data, this can normally be done inside a view, so JPA can just map to the simplified data.

Using views does require database expertise, and the definition of views can be database dependent.

==Interfaces==
Interfaces can be used for two main purposes in a model.  The first is as a public interface that defines the public API for the class.
The second is as a common type that allows multiple distinct implementers.

===Public Interfaces===
If you have a public interface in JPA, you just need to map the implementation class and are fine for the most part.
One issue is that you need to use the implementation class for queries, as JPA does not know about the interface.
For JPQL the default alias is also the implementation class, but you could redefine this to be the public interface by setting the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;code&gt;Entity&lt;/code&gt;
to be the public interface.

Some JPA providers allow interfaces to be defined.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] / [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support defining and querying on public interfaces using a &lt;code&gt;DescriptorCustomizer&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;InterfacePolicy&lt;/code&gt;.

====Example public interface alias====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity(name=&quot;Employee&quot;)
public class EmployeeImpl {
  ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

If you have a relationship that uses the public interface, instead of the implementation, then JPA will not know how to map this correctly.  You can using the &lt;code&gt;targetEntity&lt;/code&gt; attribute to define that the relationship is too the implementation class (see [[Java_Persistence/Relationships#Target_Entity|Target Entity]]).

====Example public interface relationship====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity(name=&quot;Employee&quot;)
public class EmployeeImpl {
  @ManyToOne(targetEntity=EmployeeImpl.class)
  private Employee manager;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Interface Types===
If you have a common interfaces with multiple distinct implementers, this can have some issues.
If you use the interface to define a variable relationship, then this is difficult to map.
JPA has no direct support for interfaces or variable relationships.  You could change the interface to be a &lt;code&gt;abstract&lt;/code&gt; class, then use &lt;code&gt;TABLE_PER_CLASS&lt;/code&gt; inheritance to map it.
Otherwise, you could split the relationship into multiple relationships, one per each implementer, or you could just remove the relationship and query for the related objects instead.
Querying on an interface is also difficult, you would need to query on each implementer of the interface, and then union the results in memory.

Some JPA providers have support for mapping interfaces, and for variable relationships.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] / [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support mapping interfaces using a &lt;code&gt;SessionCustomizer&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;RelationalDescriptor&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;InterfacePolicy&lt;/code&gt;.  Variable relationships can be defined using the &lt;code&gt;@VariableOneToOne&lt;/code&gt; annotation or XML.

==Stored Procedures==
A stored procedure is a procedure or function that resides on the database.  Stored procedures are typically written in some database specific language that is similar to SQL, such as PL/SQL on Oracle.  Some databases such as Oracle also support stored procedures written in Java.

Stored procedures can be useful to perform batch data processing tasks.  By writing the task in the database, it avoids the cost of sending the data to and from the database client, so can operate much more efficiently.  Stored procedures can also be used to access database specific functionality that can only be accessed on the server.  Stored procedures can also be used if strict security requirements as required, to avoid giving users access to the raw tables or unverified SQL operations.  Some legacy application have also been written in database procedural languages, and need to be integrated with.

The disadvantages of using stored procedures is they are less flexible than using SQL, and require developing and maintaining functionality that is often written in a different language than the application developers may be used to, and difficult to develop and debug, and typically using a limited procedural programming language.  There is also a general misconception that using stored procedures will improve performance, in that if you put the same SQL the application is executing inside a stored procedure it will somehow become faster.  This is a false, and normally the opposite is true, as stored procedures restrict the dynamic ability of the persistence layer to optimize data retrieval.  Stored procedures only improve performance when they use more optimal SQL than the application, typically when they perform an entire task on the database.  To achieve optimal performance from SQL generated in an application you must use prepared statements - otherwise the database will have to create a new execution plan each time you submit a query. 

===JPA 2.1 StoredProcedureQuery===
JPA 2.1 supports calling database stored procedures using the &lt;code&gt;StoredProcedureQuery&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;@NamedStoredProcedureQuery&lt;/code&gt; annotation or &lt;code&gt;&lt;named-stored-procedure-query&gt;&lt;/code&gt; XML element.  JPA supports both named stored procedures calls defined in meta-data and created through &lt;code&gt;EntityManager.createNamedStoredProcedureQuery()&lt;/code&gt;, and dynamic stored procedure calls created through &lt;code&gt;EntityManager.createStoredProcedureQuery()&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;StoredProcedureQuery&lt;/code&gt; is a JPA Query that provides additional API for setting the stored procedure parameters, and for accessing output parameters and multiple result sets.  A &lt;code&gt;StoredProcedureQuery&lt;/code&gt; can return entity objects, or data, similar to native SQL queries.  A &lt;code&gt;ResultSetMapping&lt;/code&gt; can be used to map the returned fields to the entity columns.

Some databases such as MySQL, SQL Server and Sybase support stored procedure that return result sets.  Some databases such as Oracle do not, but do support output parameters that return cursors.
If the stored procedure returns a result set, or a cursor output parameter, &lt;code&gt;getResultList()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;getSingleResult()&lt;/code&gt; can be used.  If the stored procedure has multiple result sets, or multiple cursor output parameters, then calling &lt;code&gt;getResultList()&lt;/code&gt; again will return the next result set or cursor output parameter.  If the stored procedure does not return anything, &lt;code&gt;executeUpdate()&lt;/code&gt; can be used.  &lt;code&gt;StoredProcedureQuery&lt;/code&gt; also defines an &lt;code&gt;execute()&lt;/code&gt; API, that executes the procedure and returns a &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt; indicating if a result set was returned.  After execution, any of the stored procedures output parameters can be accessed using &lt;code&gt;getOutputParameterValue()&lt;/code&gt;.

The stored procedure parameters are defined through the &lt;code&gt;@StoredProcedureParameter&lt;/code&gt; annotation or &lt;code&gt;&lt;stored-procedure-parameter&gt;&lt;/code&gt; XML element, or for dynamic stored procedure calls through the &lt;code&gt;StoredProcedureQuery.registerStoredProcedureParameter()&lt;/code&gt; API.  Parameters can be named or by index, define the corresponding Java type for the parameter, and define the parameter directional mode through &lt;code&gt;ParameterMode&lt;/code&gt;.  The mode can be one of &lt;code&gt;IN&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;INOUT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;OUT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;REF_CURSOR&lt;/code&gt;.  A type of &lt;code&gt;void.class&lt;/code&gt; can be used for ref cursors.

====Example named stored procedure annotation====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
// This stored procedure returns a result set and has one input parameter.
@NamedStoredProcedureQuery(
    name = &quot;ReadAddressById&quot;,
    resultClasses = Address.class,
    procedureName = &quot;READ_ADDRESS&quot;,
    parameters = {
        @StoredProcedureParameter(mode=IN, name=&quot;P_ADDRESS_ID&quot;, type=Long.class)
    }
)
@Entity
public class Address {
  ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====Example calling a named stored procedure====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
StoredProcedureQuery query = em.createNamedStoredProcedureQuery(&quot;ReadAddressById&quot;);
query.setParameter(&quot;P_ADDRESS_ID&quot;, 12345);
List&lt;Address&gt; result = query.getResultList();
&lt;/source&gt;

====Example named cursored stored procedure annotation====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
// This stored procedure returns a cursor output parameter, and has one input parameter.
@NamedStoredProcedureQuery(
    name = &quot;ReadAddressById&quot;,
    resultClasses = Address.class,
    procedureName = &quot;READ_ADDRESS&quot;,
    parameters = {
        @StoredProcedureParameter(mode=IN, name=&quot;P_ADDRESS_ID&quot;, type=Long.class),
        @StoredProcedureParameter(mode=REF_CURSOR, name=&quot;CUR_ADDRESS&quot;, type=void.class)
    }
)
@Entity
public class Address {
  ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====Example calling a named stored procedure with a cursor output parameter====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
StoredProcedureQuery query = em.createNamedStoredProcedureQuery(&quot;ReadAddressById&quot;);
query.setParameter(&quot;P_ADDRESS_ID&quot;, 12345);
query.execute();
List&lt;Address&gt; result = (List&lt;Address&gt;)query.getOutputParameterValue(&quot;CUR_ADDRESS&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

====Example calling a dynamic stored procedure====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
StoredProcedureQuery query = em.createStoredProcedureQuery(&quot;VALIDATE_ADDRESS&quot;);
query.registerStoredProcedureParameter(&quot;P_COUNTRY&quot;, String.class, ParameterMode.IN);
query.registerStoredProcedureParameter(&quot;P_PROVINCE&quot;, String.class, ParameterMode.IN);
query.registerStoredProcedureParameter(&quot;P_CITY&quot;, String.class, ParameterMode.IN);
query.registerStoredProcedureParameter(&quot;P_STREET&quot;, String.class, ParameterMode.IN);
query.registerStoredProcedureParameter(&quot;P_POSTAL_CD&quot;, String.class, ParameterMode.IN);
query.registerStoredProcedureParameter(&quot;OUT_VALID&quot;, Boolean.class, ParameterMode.OUT);
query.registerStoredProcedureParameter(&quot;OUT_ID&quot;, Long.class, ParameterMode.OUT);

query.setParameter(&quot;P_COUNTRY&quot;, &quot;Canada&quot;);
query.setParameter(&quot;P_PROVINCE&quot;, &quot;ON&quot;);
query.setParameter(&quot;P_CITY&quot;, &quot;Ottawa&quot;);
query.setParameter(&quot;P_STREET&quot;, &quot;99 Bank&quot;);
query.setParameter(&quot;P_POSTAL_CD&quot;, &quot;K2H8L2&quot;);

query.execute();
Boolean isValid = (Boolean)query.getOutputParameterValue(&quot;OUT_VALID&quot;);
Long id = (Long)query.getOutputParameterValue(&quot;OUT_ID&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

===Stored Procedures in JPA 2.0===
JPA 2.0 does not have any direct support for stored procedures.  Some types of stored procedures can be executed in JPA through using native queries.  Native queries in JPA allow any SQL that returns nothing, or returns a database result set to be executed.  The syntax to execute a stored procedure depends on the database. JPA native SQL queries do not support stored procedures that use &lt;code&gt;OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;INOUT&lt;/code&gt; parameters.  Some databases such as DB2, Sybase and SQL Server allow for stored procedures to return result sets.  Oracle does not allow results sets to be returned, only &lt;code&gt;OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt; parameters, but does define a &lt;code&gt;CURSOR&lt;/code&gt; type that can be returned as an &lt;code&gt;OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt; parameter.  Oracle also supports stored functions, that can return a single value.  A stored function can normally be executed using a native SQL query by selecting the function value from the Oracle &lt;code&gt;DUAL&lt;/code&gt; table.

Some JPA providers have extended support for stored procedures, some also support overriding any CRUD operation for an &lt;code&gt;Entity&lt;/code&gt; with a stored procedure or custom SQL.  Some JPA providers have support for &lt;code&gt;CURSOR&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt; parameters.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] / [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support stored procedures and stored functions using the &lt;code&gt;@NamedStoredProcedureQuery, @NamedStoredFunctionQuery&lt;/code&gt; annotations or XML, or the &lt;code&gt;StoredProcedureCall, StoredFunctionCall&lt;/code&gt; classes.  Overriding any CRUD operation for a class or relationship are also supported using a &lt;code&gt;DescriptorCustomizer&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;DescriptorQueryManager&lt;/code&gt; class.  IN, OUT, INOUT, and &lt;code&gt;CURSOR&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt; parameters are supported.

====Example executing a stored procedure on Oracle====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
EntityManager em = getEntityManager();
Query query = em.createNativeQuery(&quot;BEGIN VALIDATE_EMP(P_EMP_ID=&gt;?); END;&quot;);
query.setParameter(1, empId);
query.executeUpdate();
&lt;/source&gt;

===PL/SQL Stored Procedures===
In Oracle stored procedures are typically written in Oracle's PL/SQL language.  PL/SQL in Oracle supports some additional data-types, that Oracle does not support through SQL or JDBC.  These include types such as &lt;code&gt;BOOLEAN&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;TABLE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;RECORD&lt;/code&gt;.  Accessing these types or procedures is difficult from Java, as these types are not supported by JDBC.  One workaround is to wrap the PL/SQL stored procedures with normal stored procedures that transform the PL/SQL types to standard SQL/JDBC types, such as &lt;code&gt;INT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;VARRAY&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt;), and &lt;code&gt;OBJECT TYPE&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;Struct&lt;/code&gt;).  Some JPA providers have extended support for calling PL/SQL stored procedures.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] / [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support PL/SQL stored procedures and functions using the &lt;code&gt;@NamedPLSQLStoredProcedureQuery, @NamedPLSQLStoredFunctionQuery&lt;/code&gt; annotations or XML, or the &lt;code&gt;PLSQLStoredProcedureCall, PLSQLStoredFunctionCall&lt;/code&gt; classes.

==Structured Object-Relational Data Types==
Back in the hay day of object-oriented databases (OODBMS) many of the relational database vendors decided to added object-oriented concepts to relational data.  These new &lt;i&gt;hybrid&lt;/i&gt; databases were called Object-Relational in that they could store both object and relational data.  These object-relational data-types were standardized as part of SQL3 and support was added for them from Java in the JDBC 2.0 API.  Although there was lots of hype around the new forms of data, object-relational data never caught on much, as people seemed to prefer their standard relational data.  I would not normally recommend using object-relational data, as relational data is much more standard, but if you have really complex data, it may be something to investigate.

Some common object-relational database features include:
* Object types (structures)
* Arrays and array types
* Nested tables
* Inheritance
* Object ids (OIDs)
* Refs

Databases that support object-relational data include:
* Oracle
* DB2
* PostgreSQL

The basic model allows you to define Structs or Object-types to represent your data, the structures can have nested structures, arrays of basic data or other structures, and refs to other structures.  You can then store a structure in a normal relational table column, or create a special table to store the structures directly.  Querying is basic SQL, with a few extensions to handle traversing the special types.

JPA does not support object-relational data-types, but some JPA providers may offer some support.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] / [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support object-relational data-types through their &lt;code&gt;@Struct, @Structure, @Array&lt;/code&gt; annotations and XML, or their &lt;code&gt;ObjectRelationalDataTypeDescriptor&lt;/code&gt; and mapping classes.  Custom support is also offered for Oracle spatial database JGeometry structures and other structured data-types using the &lt;code&gt;@StructConverter&lt;/code&gt; annotation or XML.

==XML Data Types==
With the advent of XML databases, many relational database decided to add enhanced XML support.  Although it was always possible to store XML in a relational database just using a &lt;code&gt;VARCHAR&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;CLOB&lt;/code&gt; column, having the database aware of the XML data does have its advantages.  The main advantage is databases that offer XML support allow querying of the XML data using XPath or XQuery syntax.  Some databases also allow the XML data to be stored more efficiently than in Lob storage.

Databases with XML support include:
* Oracle (XDB)
* DB2
* PostgreSQL

JPA has no extended support for XML data, although it is possible to store an XML String into the database, just mapped as a &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt;.  Some JPA provider may offer extended XML data support.  Such as query extensions, or allow mapping an XML DOM.

If you wish to map the XML data into objects, you could make use of the JAXB specification.  You may even be able to integrate this with your JPA objects.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] / [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support Oracle XDB XMLType columns using their &lt;code&gt;DirectToXMLTypeMapping&lt;/code&gt;.  XMLTypes can be mapped either as String or as an XML DOM (Document).  Query extensions are provided for XPath queries within &lt;code&gt;Expression&lt;/code&gt; queries.  EclipseLink also includes a JAXB implementation for object-XML mapping.

==Filters==
Some times it is desirable to filter some of the contents of a table from all queries.  This is normally because the table is shared, either by multiple types, applications, tenants, or districts, and the JPA application is only interested in a subset of the rows.  It may also be that the table includes historical or archive rows that should be ignored by the JPA application.

JPA does not provide any specific support for filtering data, but there are some options available.  Inheritance can be used to include a type check on the rows for a class.  For example, if you had a &lt;code&gt;STATUS&lt;/code&gt; column in an &lt;code&gt;EMPLOYEE&lt;/code&gt; table, you could define an &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;CurrentEmployee&lt;/code&gt; subclass whose discriminator &lt;code&gt;STATUS&lt;/code&gt; was &lt;code&gt;ACTIVE&lt;/code&gt;, and always use &lt;code&gt;CurrentEmployee&lt;/code&gt; in the application.  Similarly you could define an &lt;code&gt;ACMEEmployee&lt;/code&gt; subclass that used the &lt;code&gt;TENANT&lt;/code&gt; column as its class discriminator of value &lt;code&gt;ACME&lt;/code&gt;.  Another solution is to use database views to filter the data and map the entities to the views.

These solutions do not work with dynamic filtering, where the filter criteria parameters are not know until runtime (such as tenant, or district).  Also complex criteria cannot be modeled through inheritance, although database views should still work.  One solution is to always append the criteria to any query, such as appending a JPQL string, or JPA Criteria in the application code.

Virtual Private Database (VPD) support may also provide a solution.  Some databases such as Oracle support VPD, allow context based filtering of rows based on the connected user or proxy certificate.

Some JPA providers have specific support for filtering data.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] / [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support filtering data through their &lt;code&gt;@AdditionalCriteria&lt;/code&gt; annotation and XML.  This allows an arbitrary JPQL fragment to be appended to all queries for the entity.  The fragment can contain parameters that can be set through persistence unit or context properties at runtime.  Oracle VPD is also supported, include Oracle proxy authentication and isolated data.

==History==
A common desire in database applications is to maintain a record and history of the database changes.  This can be used for tracking and auditing purposes, or to allow undoing of changes, or to keep a record of the system's data over time.  Many database have auditing functionality that allows some level of tracking changes made to the data.  Some databases such as Oracle's &lt;i&gt;Flashback&lt;/i&gt; feature allow the automatic tracking of history at the row level, and even allow querying on past versions of the data.

It is also possible for an application to maintain its own history through its data model.  All that is required is to add a &lt;code&gt;START&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;END&lt;/code&gt; timestamp column to the table.  The &lt;i&gt;current&lt;/i&gt; row is then the one in which the &lt;code&gt;END&lt;/code&gt; timestamp is null.  When a row is inserted its &lt;code&gt;START&lt;/code&gt; timestamp will be set to the current time.  When a row is updated, instead of updating the row a new row will be inserted with the same id and data, but a different &lt;code&gt;START&lt;/code&gt; timestamp, and the old row will be updated to set its &lt;code&gt;END&lt;/code&gt; timestamp to the current time.  The primary key of the table will need to have the &lt;code&gt;START&lt;/code&gt; timestamp added to it.

History can also be used to avoid deletion.  Instead of deleting a row, the &lt;code&gt;END&lt;/code&gt; timestamp can just be set to the current time.  Another solution is to add a &lt;code&gt;DELETED&lt;/code&gt; boolean column to the table, and record when a row is deleted.

The history data could either be stored in-place in the altered table, or the table could be left to only contain the current version of the data, and a mirror history table could be added to store the data.  In the mirror case, database triggers could be used to write to the history table.  For the in-place case a database view could be used to give a view of the table as of the current time.

To query the current data from a history table, any query must include the clause where the &lt;code&gt;END&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;.  To query as of a point in time, the where clause must include where the point in time is between the &lt;code&gt;START&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;END&lt;/code&gt; timestamps.

JPA does not define any specific history support.

Oracle flashback can be used with JPA, but any queries for historical data will need to use native SQL.

If a mirror history table is used with triggers, JPA can still be used to query to current data.  A subclass or sibling class could also be mapped to the history table to allow querying of history data.

If a database view is used, the JPA could be used by mapping the &lt;code&gt;Entity&lt;/code&gt; to the view.

If a history table is used JPA could still be used to map to the table, and a &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; attribute could be added to the object.  Queries for the current data could append the current time to the query.  Relationships are more difficult, as JPA requires relationships to be by primary key, and historical relationships would not be.

Some JPA providers have support for history.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] / [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support Oracle flashback querying as well as application specific history.  Historical queries can be defined using the query hint &lt;code&gt;&quot;eclipselink.history.as-of&quot;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Expression&lt;/code&gt; queries.  Automatic tracking of history is also supported using the &lt;code&gt;HistoryPolicy&lt;/code&gt; API that supports maintaining and querying a mirror history table.

==Logical Deletes==

==Auditing==

See, [[Java_Persistence/Auditing_and_Security|Auditing and Security]].

==Replication==
Data replication can be used to backup data, for fault tolerance and fail-over, or for load balancing and scaling the database.

For replication, changes are written to multiple databases, either by the application, JPA provider, or database back-end.
For fail-over, if one of the databases goes down, the other can be used without loss of data or application downtime.
For load-balancing, read requests can be load balanced across the replicated databases to reduce the load on each database, and improve the scalability of the application.

Most enterprise database support some form of automatic backup or replication.  Clustered database such as Oracle RAC also allow for load balancing, fail-over and high availability.
If your database supports replication or clustering, then it is normally transparent to JPA.  A specialize DataSource (such as Oracle UCP, or WebLogic GridLink) may need to be used to handle load-balancing and fail-over.

JPA does not define any specific support for data replication, but some JPA provider provide replication support.  If your database does not support replication, you can implement it yourself through having multiple persistence units, and persisting and merging your objects to both databases.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] / [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support replication, load-balancing and fail-over.  Replication and load balancing is supported through EclipseLink's partitioning support using the &lt;code&gt;@ReplicationPartitioning&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;@RoundRobinPartitioning&lt;/code&gt; annotations and XML.

==Partitioning==
Data partitioning can be used to scale an application across multiple database machines, or with a clustered database such as Oracle RAC.

Partitioning splits your data across each of the database nodes.  There is horizontal partitioning, and vertical partitioning.  Vertical partitioning is normally the easiest to implement.  You can just put half of your classes on one database, and the other half on another.  Ideally the two sets would be isolated from each other and not have any cross database relationships.  This can be done directly in JPA, by having two different persistence units, one for each database.

For horizontal partitioning  you need to split your data across multiple database nodes.  Each database node will have the same tables, but each node's table will only store part of the data.  You can partition the data by the data values, such as range partitioning, value partitioning, hash partitioning, or even round robin.  JPA does not define any data partitioning support, so you either need to define a different class per partition, or use JPA vendor specific functionality.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] / [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support both horizontal and vertical data partitioning.  Hash, value, range, pinned and custom partitioning is supported at the Session, Entity, and Query level.  Partitioning is support through the &lt;code&gt;@Partitioning, @HashPartitioning, @RangePartitioning, @ValuePartitioning, @PinnedPartitioning&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;@Partitioned&lt;/code&gt; annotations and XML.

      <comment>/* Forces between two colliding objects */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

In the previous chapters, we concerned ourselves only with isolated objects.  In this chapter, we'll see what happens when two (or more) objects interact which each other, in the form of contact between the two bodies (as in a collision, or in the sudden motion of two or more objects due to a need for them to separate due to an explosion).  

== Forces between two colliding objects ==

When two objects come in contact with each other, each exerts a pushing force on the other (think of the last time you bumped into someone in a crowded place: you felt a push, and so did they).  Further, the force that one exerts on the other is always exactly the same. This is Newton's third law of &quot;equal and opposite reaction forces.&quot;  For example, if two cars collide, during the collision, car A will exert a force on car B (&lt;math&gt;F_{AB}&lt;/math&gt;), and car B will exert the exact same force on car A (&lt;math&gt;F_{BA}&lt;/math&gt;).   The two forces will have the same strength, but be in exactly opposite directions to one another. In other words, &lt;math&gt;F_{AB}=-F_{BA}&lt;/math&gt;.   It doesn't matter if one car is heavier (more massive) than the other. The push force from one car will equal the push force from the other.  What if one car is a small Honda and the other car a huge SUV? If so, when in contact, the force the Honda exerts on the SUV will be equal to the force the SUV exerts on the Honda, only in the opposite direction. What about a bug hitting a car windshield? The force of the bug on the windshield is equal to the force of the windshield on the bug, only in the opposite direction. Why then does the bug get crushed and the SUV doesn't even feel the collision? Because the resulting motion \emph{after the collision} is driven by the acceleration the body takes from the collision, while in contact with the other object.  Suppose the equal and opposite force of the bug-windshield collision is 0.1 N.  The bug has a mass of 0.001 gram, or 1x 10&lt;Sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; kg. It's resulting acceleration will be a=F/m=0.1 N/1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; kg=100,000 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The SUV, with a mass of about 4,000 kg gets an acceleration of a=0.1 N/4000 kg =0.000025 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Impulse ==

Collisions are typically very brief, say &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; ms, or &lt;math&gt;0.001&lt;/math&gt; s. During this time, a parameter called &quot;impulse&quot; exists, defined as &lt;math&gt;J=\Delta p&lt;/math&gt;, which is the change in an object's momentum.  How far does the bug and SUV move in this time? The bug from above will move &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt; cm, the SUV will &quot;move&quot; about the diameter of an atom making up the windshield. The bug get crushed because its internal structure cannot sustain an acceleration of about 10,000g.

== Momentum ==

This equal and opposite force idea leads to momentum, which is defined as &lt;math&gt;p=mv&lt;/math&gt; or more correctly, &lt;math&gt;{\vec p}=m{\vec v}&lt;/math&gt;. Notice &lt;math&gt;{\vec p}&lt;/math&gt; involves velocity directly. We also have &quot;conservation of momentum&quot; that says that 

&lt;math&gt;{\vec p}_{before}={\vec p}_{after}&lt;/math&gt;.

The &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; refer to before and after a collision. This law itself allows us to ignore the physics \emph{of the collision} and instead focus on the physics \emph{just before and just after the collision}.  More correctly, the law is 

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma{\vec p}_{before}=\Sigma{\vec p}_{after}&lt;/math&gt;,

indicating that the law means add all objects carrying momentum before a collision and set equal to the sum of all momenta carrying objects after the collision. Since &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a vector, so you must sum the momenta of all objects in the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; direction, then in the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; direction, both before and after the collision in order the conservation law to be helpful.  Lastly, there are two types of collisions, elastic and inelastic. In elastic collisions, the colliding objects bounce off of each other, while in inelastic, they all stick together creating a new &quot;conglomerate mass&quot; which is the sum of the individual masses that stuck together.  In applying the conservation law for an inelastic collision, you typically have something like 

&lt;math&gt;m_1 {\vec v_{1before}} + m_2 {\vec v_{2before}} + m_3 {\vec v_{3before}} + ... = (m_1+m_2+m_3+...){\vec v}_{after}&lt;/math&gt;.  

Notice that there's only one velocity after the collision 

(&lt;math&gt;{\vec v}_{after}&lt;/math&gt;) because only the &quot;big blob&quot; is moving after they all collided and stuck together.  For an elastic collisions, where two objects (1 and 2) collide along a single axis, we'll have 

&lt;math&gt;v_{1final}=\frac{m_1-m_2}{m_1+m_2}v_{1before}+\frac{2m_2}{m_1+m_2}v_{2before}&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;v_{2after}=\frac{2m_1}{m_1+m_2}v_{1before}+\frac{m_2-m_1}{m_1+m_2}v_{2before}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== rename ==

I suggest rename:
&quot;Data Compression/Library/Dictionaries&quot; to
&quot;Data Compression/Dictionary compression&quot;.

I see that &quot;library&quot; is very frequently used with data compression -- but I only see it used in the sense of a software library. Any particular data compression algorithm can be implemented in a &quot;data compression library&quot;.
Is there some other &quot;library compression&quot; I am overlooking?

I see that &quot;dictionary compression&quot; is a specific category of data compression algorithms,
somewhat complementary to &quot;entropy coding&quot; and &quot;Markov compression&quot; and &quot;fractal compression&quot;, etc.

:I don't know the rational that lead to the creation of the page (the user in unregistered so my bet is that we will never know), but I put forward that there can indeed be missing page about libraries in general (as a reference to other reference datasets besides dictionaries, even if I can't recall special distinctions, probably references table or caches, here the use of the word library isn't a reference to programming libraries), especially if the book will cover compression protocols for telecommunications. The page name was probably derived by a red link on the toc or/and the intention to use the automatically generated navigation scheme between close related pages, the same issue can be extended to the Order/Entropy page. Not stating an opinion only an observation.
:I truly like the simplicity of how subpages facilitate navigation and turn navigational templates obsolete, so if you aren't adamantly against the concept see if altering the TOC and renaming the sections would satisfy...
:One observation I make is that the book is poorly named, since it only focus on digital compression, the scope doesn't seem to cover signal or analog data. IIRC the Huffman encoding (the base for the LZ algorithm) and FAX image compression uses a symbolic table/library/dictionary to compress the transmission. A good substitution to the word &quot;library&quot; would be &quot;dataset&quot;.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:51, 9 September 2009 (UTC)

:: ''we will never know'' ? I know [[User:Graeme E. Smith]] says he created it[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DavidCary&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=1619687].
:: ''here the use of the word library isn't a reference to programming libraries'' ? Is that so? Then may I ask: to what is it a reference? Allow me to repeat my earlier question: ''Any particular data compression algorithm can be implemented in a &quot;data compression library&quot;. Is there some other &quot;library compression&quot; I am overlooking?'' Is it merely a synonym for &quot;dictionary compression&quot;?
:: ''the book is poorly named ... the scope doesn't seem to cover signal or analog data.'' ? I don't understand. Music and photographs are &quot;analog data&quot;, right? Are you saying that this &quot;Data Compression&quot; book should *not* discuss analog data compression, and so we should delete the sections at [[Data Compression]] that discuss music and photograph compression?
:: p.s.: Huffman encoding is not the base for the LZ algorithm. Hopefully someday this book will make that clear. :-) --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 23:58, 9 September 2009 (UTC)

::: :) Well I didn't know that I only looked at the page history...
::: As I said above the word library could probably refer to different datasets (among other suppositions I refereed), those dataset aren't only restricted to dictionaries, sometimes the algorithms talks about several types of tables, alphabets and other data structures. But a library section would be cool too, covering programming libraries and distinctions among the algorithms they implement.
::: I hadn't read the book (and I haven't contributed content to it, so all this comments are made as by point reader). For what I examined most of it seemed to deal only with digital data, now that you mentioned the audio section does mention analog and signals (but not the image section).
::: As a reader I have a special interest on this book (and I have some background knowledge on the subject, mostly on the side of telecommunications). As an implementer (I'm writing a p2p app.) and possible future contributor, I'm interested in some algorithms, especially if they have free and tested implementations (LZF, LZWA as in the 7z SDK and others) from the point of bandwidth savings/and their overall system footprint, those and any other algorithm that can optimize and reduce queries against content (FastBit etc). I may contribute something on those lines later on.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:53, 10 September 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">TORAH OBSERVANCE

With the restoration of Torah observance there is also of course a return to the ancient system of the study of the Torah which goes back to the second Temple period and was in existence at the time of Yeshua. This was begun by Ezra after the Jews returned from their Babylonian captivity.
A standardised pattern of study meant that all of Yahweh God's people were studying the same portion at the same time and moving forward as one community in their understanding of the Word.

This also meant that any person could go into any synagogue anywhere in the world and be prepared for the subject of study. Thus Yeshua knew the appointed time to proclaim the &quot;acceptable year of Yahweh&quot; (Luke 4:16-19) when He went into the synagogue at Nazareth. Just as Yeshua and Paul walked into the synagogues and opened to the portion for that week, so it is also possible to do the same today, among those who are walking the same Way.

This pattern of study has continued to the present day in Jewish communities and is now being incorporated by the redeemed community of Yeshua.

The Torah readings which follow are compiled from the insights and understanding of Hebrew scholars and Rabbis who have expounded these portions of scripture in much the same way as has been done now for thousands of years.

When God's people study together, they grow together.   One benefit with keeping the Torah pattern of study, is being in harmony with everyone else who is following the same schedule. This brings unity into the Body of Messiah as the Holy Spirit moves forward in preparing us to be presented to our Bridegroom as a bride without spot or wrinkle.

The Torah portions go through in a cycle from Genesis to Deuteronomy; ending in the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles (Simchat Torah -22nd Tishrie) and starting again to renew the cycle on the 23rd Tishrei from the first chapter of Genesis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ki Tavo (When You Enter In)   Devarim/Deuteronomy26:1-29:8

At this point in the narrative, the children of Israel are once again on the precipice of entering into the Land and Moses is giving some of his final words of instruction.  In fact, the very name of this portion, Ki Tavo or ‘when you enter in,’ connotes the reality of the imminent entrance into the Land of Promise.  After Moses goes over some of the details regarding the first fruit offerings and relationships with the Levitical priests, the strangers, the widows and orphans, he turns to making a summary statement that outlines exactly why the Holy One chose Israel for its unique position among the other nations. 

“This day Yahweh your God commands you to observe these statutes and judgements, therefore you shall be careful to observe them with all your heart and with all your soul”  (26:16)

On the basis of them being a people who walk in His ways and reflect His characteristics, Yahweh reaffirms the covenant which He made with them at Mt. Sinai and which will come into effect with them entering the land.
“Yahweh has today declared you to be His people, a treasured possession, as He promised you, and that you should keep all His commandments; and that He will set you high above all nations which He has made, for praise, fame, and honor; and that you shall be a consecrated people to Yahweh your God, as He has spoken” (Devarim/Deuteronomy 26:18-19). 

This is the realisation of the covenant enacted  at Sinai where Yahweh said to them,  “Now then, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be My own possession among all the peoples, for all the earth is Mine; and you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.” (Shemot/Exodus19:5-6). 
As Israel was entering into the Land the terms of the contract came into effect.  That is why stones were erected with all the words of the Torah on them and why they stood on the mountains to hear the blessings and the curses.


'''The Divine Commission In The Covenant'''

Immediately upon crossing the Jordan and upon entering the Promised Land Yahweh instructed the Israelites to set up a stone monument containing the Torah and to construct an altar for burnt sacrifices.  (27:1-10)   Yahweh required the people to recite a “pledge of allegiance” affirming their commitment to Him before entering the Land. (27:11ff)  The significance of this is that the promised inheritance is based on the foundation of Torah observance and a consecrated life.  On an individual basis in our personal lives, this is natural counterpart to inheriting the promises of the kingdom and is only entered into after the wilderness experience of dying to the lusts of the flesh which war against our compliance to obey His Word.   The true sacrifices which He requires are a broken and contrite heart directed toward relationship with Him, by sacrificing one’s own desires for the purpose of being found acceptable to enter into communion with Him. (Psalms 51:16-19; Hosea 6:6). 
This altar which Yahweh command the Israelites to construct was of rough, uncut and whole stones.  This prophetically points to the Messiah, the Rock which was not cut with hands, the chief cornerstone of the kingdom.  Read Daniel 2:35, 45; Psalm 118:22; Matthew 21:42; Luke 20:17; Acts 4:11; Eph. 2:22.   Yeshua the Messiah became our living Altar and Sacrifice.  (Isaiah 53:2)


'''The Covenant'''

These boulders of unhewn stones which Yahweh commanded the Israelites to place on Mt. Ebal (the mount of cursing) and carve into them the Torah-law, were then coated with lime plaster rendering them white, a symbol of purity - His righteousness.  An Israeli archeologist, Adam Zertal, has found an enormous altar made of large stones on Mount Eval which has the same measurements as the altar in the temple.  Around the altar, there has been found remains of plaster on which Yehoshua wrote the Torah, see Joshua 8:30-35.

There they built the altar where burnt and peace offerings were to be made (27:2-8).   The Torah were written on stones on Mt. Ebal  (the mount representing the results of Torah violation) rather than on Mt. Gerizim because the Torah exposes transgression which causes the curse and when sin is exposed we then need to have an altar to make atonement and effect a consecration of our lives. An erroneous concept has identified Torah as the source of the curse,  as compared to the Torah written on the hearts of men in the New covenant, but Paul calls the ‘law’ - i.e. the Torah,  kadosh (holy), just and good in Romans 7:12. 

Yeshua was wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquities, and the iniquities of us all were laid upon Him and He was made an offering for sin (Isa. 53:5,6,10).   He was the Living Torah, the Word of Elohim made flesh (John 1:1ff), Who redeemed us from the curse of the law (Gal. 3:13) (i.e., the result of our sinning which is the violation of Yahweh’s law - the Torah  [1 John 3:4],  the wages of which,  is death [Rom. 6:23])   

The six tribes appointed to read the blessings from Mount Gerizim (880 ft. above sea level) were all children of ‘free women’ (Leah and Rachel).  While those, with the exception of Reuben (who was lost the right of the firstborn because of the lusts of his flesh with his father’s handmaid, 1 Chron. 5:1), that were appointed to read the curses from Mount Ebal (940 ft. above sea level) were children of bondwomen (Bilhah and Zilpah), servants to the two wives. (Matthew Henry Commentary 27:11-16).   The mountain of cursing is the highest, just as there are more curses than blessings.

The promises of the kingdom belong to the children of the “free woman” according to Paul’s allegory in Galatians 4:22;  pertaining to Isaac and Ishmael, which is a similar situation to that of the children of Jacob - those born of the ‘free woman’ inherit the promises.  This illustrates in typology the fact that those who walk by faith in the promises, inherit the material and spiritual blessing (namely, eternal life through Yeshua the Messiah), but for those who are in bondage to or under the curses of the Torah/law it is because they walk in sin (which is the transgression of the law, see 1 John 3:4).   A  legalistic form of compliance which is not from the heart is servitude and is born out of self-serving motivations and not out of covenant love relationship.
 

'''The Curses and the Blessings'''

According to Talmud,[Sotah 32a] six tribes went up to the top of each mountain. The priests and the Levites remained in the valley between the two mountains around the ark. They uttered the blessings toward Gerizim and then the curses that are written in the Torah toward Eval. The first blessing read, “Blessed is the man who does not make an idol.” and so on.  After each blessing the six tribes answered, Amen” as did the other six tribes after each curse.

The admonitions contained in these verses are not in a random order (27:15-18).  Consider the following: the prohibition against idolatry (verse 15) is juxtaposed with that of degrading one’s parents (i.e., not honoring one’s parents, or as Rabbi Hirsch puts it in his commentary, “who outwardly is respectful to his parents but inwardly considers himself vastly superior to them”) with removing trespasses against his neighbor’s property by removing his neighbor’s boundary markers or landmarks.  A person who does not honor and fear Yahweh and turns to idolatry (the first and second commandments) will not honor one’s parents (4th commandment) and he will likewise not honor the property of one’s neighbor (including his wife).  Juxtaposed next to that is one who misleads a blind person (verse 18), to indicate you should not take advantage of his blindness by advising him in a way beneficial to you but to his disadvantage in order to usurp his boundary. Juxtaposed to that is one who steals justice from another by perverting judgment against one who is weaker socially or financially or who less informed at law than another thereby giving the advantage to the stronger (AS Davis Edition Baal HaTurim Chumash/Devarim, pp. 2126-2127).  Each command is interrelated with all the others which gives one insight into the statement in James 2:10.   That is why the whole of Torah is summarized as the “royal law of love.” 
Deuteronomy 28, at least in part, should be read as a warning.  Verses 28:1-14 inform us about the wonderful benefits of obedience to the teaching of Yahweh.  However, much of the rest of the chapter warns us of the terrible consequences if we do not obey them.   In Deuteronomy 28:69  we are told that the blessings and curses are part of a brit, or covenant.  A covenant is an agreement between two or more parties. Since we as Believers have a covenant with God through Yeshua’s sacrifice, the blessings and the curses apply to us also.  If we will seriously and joyfully take Yahweh at His Word, we also are to be the recipients of wonderful things.  Likewise, violations of this covenant will bring curses and not-so-wonderful things upon us.


'''Torah Observance the Condition For Blessing'''

“And it shall come to pass, if you shall hearken diligently unto the voice of Yahweh your God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command you this day, … all these blessings shall come on you, … if you hearken unto the commandments of Yahweh your God, which I command you this day, to observe and to do them:”   28:1-13

There is a law of reciprocity in the Holy Spirit that generally follows that if “You want to be blessed you must first be a blessing. However, if you want to be a blessing you must also be an obedient follower of the will and dictates of God.” In this parashat Yahweh hammers this particular point of issue into Israel.  As a matter of fact, it appears here that Yahweh is invoking an image of how a parent blesses or disciplines his or her children. He seems to take on the role of a parent who is constantly pursuing a wandering, rebellious child,  seeking to teach that which is for its own good.

Yahweh states that ungratefulness for the blessings He has given us and failure to obey Him out of a joyful and glad heart will bring curses on us (28:47).   Servile obedience will not exempt us from the curse because our obedience is not motivated by our love for Yahweh, but is out of a  self-serving motivation of saving ourselves from His wrath.   If the Believer will serve Him with unquestioned joy and gladness walking in His ways, as Deuteronomy 27:19 indicates, then, God will sanctify us and make us a treasure and an openly blessed and favored people.

“And all these blessings shall come on you, and overtake you, if you shall listen to the voice of Yahweh your God” {28:2}.  

When we’re obedient the blessings come automatically, without any effort on our part. All that is required of us to set blessings into motion in our lives is to obey God’s commandments. You see, it’s a preordained spiritual law.  However just as the blessings are spontaneous and automatic, so are the curses.   Blessings overtake us without any effort on our part. So too curses overtake us without any effort on our part.  The blessings are automatic with obedience and the curses are automatic with disobedience.   In addition we can’t apologize ourselves out of the consequences of our actions.   We can not expect God to bless us, if we disregard His physical or spiritual laws, both are as sure and deliberate in our lives.   Yahweh''s commandments are His spiritual laws. If we regard them and respect them as we do His physical laws (i.e. gravity), then all will go well with us.  Unlike gravity the spiritual results may not be visible, they may not be scientifically measurable, but they are as real and effective in our lives as gravity.  The only difference between the two, is that one is visible and measurable, while the other is invisible and can’t be scientifically measured.
Thanking Him for His blessings in our lives is a form of worship, and such a heart attitude and orientation helps us to keep our focus continually upon Him so that we will forget not all His benefits (Psalm103:2) and fall into a state of hardened heart and forgetfulness (29:2-4).  A wrong attitude will keep us from entering into the inheritance which He has for us and like Israel we will wander in the wilderness until the flesh comes to death and we learn to  direct our heart toward Him.  1 Corinthians 10

Our salvation was a free gift from Yahweh, but the maintenance of it depends on us.  “Wherefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.”  Philippians 2:12   We each must work at appropriating it into our lives in fear and trembling.  

Since the decrees are commanded by Yahweh Himself, they must be kept without any rationalisations against  or arguing about them.  In the Hebrew text of “ha chookim and ha mishpatim” (the laws and decrees), the alef tav are placed as a marker before them (alpha and omega in Greek).   This is a cryptic indication that these laws and decrees emanate from Yeshua Himself, who has identified Himself in Revelation 1: 8 as the Alef-Tav and the Alpha &amp; Omega.  Both the Alef-Tav and the Alpha &amp; Omega are the first and last letter of the Hebrew and Greek alphabets respectively. Therefore, they must correspond in purpose to each other.  For the English speaker, referring to both the Alef-Tav and the Alpha &amp; Omega is roughly equivalent to saying from A to Z.  Yeshua is the beginning and then the end of all things, be they Heavenly or physical.  Because of these things, as it is written, “Let us remember to serve Yahweh with gladness and to come into His presence with singing, for His yoke is easy and His burden is light.”

Yeshua is the Word of God, the manifestation of the entire counsel of the Almighty, the A - Z of Yahweh’s purposes.   He is the fullness of Elohim manifest in the flesh, the complete revelation of the Word and and Him the Torah finds its full manifestation.  He calls us as His followers to also be a full-orbed manifestation of the Torah lived out in our lives, reflecting the glory of His Person in our mortal bodies so that we shine as reflections of the Holy One.

Ki Tavo ends with this admonition: “Follow the terms of this covenant so that we may prosper in everything that we do.”  As it is written in Ya’akov (James) 1:22, “Be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.”


'''Firstfruits'''

Deuteronomy 26:1-2 “When you enter the land that Yahweh is giving you as a heritage, and you possess it and settle in it, you shall take some of every first fruit of the soil, which you harvest from the land that Yahweh is giving you, put it in a basket and go to the place where Yahweh will choose to establish His name.&quot;
There is an order here.  First, that we enter the land.  This is applicable on a physical and spiritual level.  Many people have come into a ‘belief’ in the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob but physically and spiritually they have not ‘entered’ the land.’  The kingdom of Yahweh is to be entered ‘into’.   Many people spend a lifetime outside the ‘land’ never venturing to ‘enter’ in.  The only way you can enter the land is through obedience to Torah, which is Yahweh’s teaching and instruction.  The Children of Israel journeyed forty years in the wilderness because they did not follow the words at Mount Sinai and they did not enter the land. Paul warns us to take care that we also do not fall short and enter into idolatry with the things of this world and fail to enter into our inheritance.  “For they drank of that spiritual Rock which followed them, and that Rock was Messiah.   But with most of them God was not well pleased.. .. ..  Now these things became our examples, to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted.  (1 Corinthians 10: 4-6)   Moses is here teaching their children how to inherit the land by keeping His commandments. 

There is a move and a call on people’s hearts to enter, possess and settle the land.  This is done in an attitude of ‘holiness’, of being separate from the things o f this world, for without holiness no one will see Yahweh (Hebrews 12:14).  As we continue to walk in holiness and overcome the ‘enemies’ of the flesh which war against our soul and keep us from obtaining our spiritual inheritance, we begin to possess the land and finally we settle and have peace (as a result of walking in His ways).  As we ‘work’ the land that Yahweh has given us, ‘fruit’ is produced.  We are to bring the ‘first of this fruit,’ (in Hebrew called Bikkurim or ‘firstfruits,’) in a basket before Him in thanksgiving for the inheritance He has given to us.  

“Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning. Of His own will He brought us forth by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures. So then, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath; for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of Yahweh. Therefore lay aside all filthiness and overflow of wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. 
But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror; for he observes himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was. But he who looks into the perfect law (Torah) of liberty and continues in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in what he does.” James 1:17-26 

We pray we all experience the entering, possessing and settling the land spiritually and physically and may our baskets of ‘firstfruits’ be overflowing as we come daily before Yahweh rejoicing in His provisions.  Selah.

The declaration which is to be made before the priest is an acknowledgement of Yahweh’s mercy as demonstrated in the history of their deliverance and creation as a nation until the promised inheritance of the land of “milk and honey”.   After arduous physical labor in clearing, terracing, plowing and planting, a farmer might say in his heart: “My power and the might of my hand have made me successful”.  He must remind himself: “And behold, now I bring the first of the fruit of the earth, which YOU, O Yahweh, have given me.”   ‘I was brought by Him to this fertile land,’ says the farmer, ‘and now I am bringing Him some of its fruit.’  This conveys more than just gratitude.  The entire land is given to the nation by Yahweh’s hand; the produce from the ground is likewise from God’s blessing and His actions; one cannot GIVE Him something of it, but one may BRING Him something – the choicest of the first fruits as a symbol and an acknowledgement of His faithfulness in the fulfilment of the covenant which He made with Abraham (Genesis ch. 15).   The firstfruit is the evidence of Yahweh’s completion of the covenant promises, i.e. You brought us to the land, we have brought you the fruits of that land. The Torah concludes, “And you shall rejoice in all the good which God has given you...” - the entire ceremony of the firstfruit presentation to the priest, highlights that destiny has been fulfilled, we have come all the way from oppression and slavery to the good land, to rejoicing and satisfaction.  He has done His part - we now do our part.   The Rabbis agree on a common reason for all these mitzvot: the offering of the “first” of everything that one has represents one’s recognition of the fact that God is Master of ALL our possessions, and that He is the source of our bounty. Rambam (Moreh Nevukhim III:39) and Sefer Ha-Chinukh (mitzva 91) 
 
This also has great spiritual significance to us to remember and appreciate what Yeshua has done for us, the price He paid for us through His incarnation and death on the tree.  Therefore every time we bring our gift to Yahweh, we are to remember where we came from, where we were and how He has been faithful to the Abrahamic covenant  enacted on our behalf by Yeshua.


'''The Seven Species'''  

First fruits are brought only from 7 species in Deuteronomy. 8: 7-10.  “a land of wheat and barley, and vines, figs, and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey”  The first of these crops were brought before the priests in a processional basket and then waved in seven directions (tenufah) before being placed on the altar.  The worshipper would then recite Deuteronomy 26:3, 5-10 as a declaration of gratitude for all that Yahweh has done.  

These 7 species all develop, for better or worse, during the 50 days from Passover to Shavuot.  This season in Israel is marked by multiple changes and climatic contrasts.  Scorching southern winds bring extreme dryness and heat; cold winds from the north and west darken the skies, generating tempestuous storms. “The northern wind is beneficial to wheat when it has reached a third of its ripening (still young), but is damaging to olive trees when they have blossomed. The southern wind has the opposite effects.   Thus the tabernacle table (of wheat showbreads) is in the north and the menorah (of olive oil) in the south” (Baba Batra 147a).
Blossoms and flowers of Israel’s native olives, grapes, pomegranates, and male dates need successive days of dry heat to open, allowing pollen to reach pistils for pollination.  Otherwise, cold northern wind and rain may blow away flowers and wash off pollen.  A prolonged southern wind can devastate wheat and barley crops, if it comes before kernels have filled with starch.  Placed together in the Temple, they symbolize a plea to their One Creator that each wind come at the right time-- e.g. the northern wind during the first weeks after Passover, aiding wheat and barley, when olive buds are still closed and the southern wind after the grain kernels have filled and stalks hardened and continuing until the flowers are pollinated. (see I Samuel 12:17-19). 
“If you pay heed to the commandments I give you this day... I’ll give the rain... that you may gather in your grain, your wine and your oil&quot;-- the Israelites had to recite these words every morning and evening, and write them upon their houses’ doorposts and their city gates (Deut. 11:13ff).

The farmer has a special affection for the fruits that are the first to ripen; he awaits their appearance with great excitement. Isaiah/Yishayahu (28:4) describes the anticipation:   “Like the first ripe fig before summer which, when one sees it, he swallows it up while it is still in his hand.”  But the Israelite farmer does not treat his first fruit, the joy of his heart, in this way:  “A person goes down to his field and sees a fig that has ripened, a cluster of grapes that has ripened or a pomegranate that has ripened – he ties a thread around them and says, ‘Behold, these are bikkurim!'” i.e. the firstfruits  (Mishna Bikkurim 3:1)  Then when they were ripe, they were carried to the sanctuary in Jerusalem during the time between Shavuot and Sukkot. During the temple period, whole families, and even others from the same community, used to go together. They went by foot with their baskets full of the seven types of fruit behind a bull whose horns were covered with gold and that had an olive wreath around its neck.  The bull was offered as a peace offering.  When they came close to Jerusalem the people used to come out to meet them with shouts of joy and playing flutes. The Levites sang Psalm 30 (which speaks of the resurrection of the Messiah that is symbolized by the first fruits, “bikurim”). When they came to the temple mount, they lifted up the baskets on their shoulders and they entered the court this way. The priests laid their hands under each basket and together they waved (tnufah) the baskets in all four directions (Numbers 18:13) in order to show that it belonged to the Yahweh God.  Then the baskets were placed by the altar and the text from Deuteronomy 26:3, 5-10 was quoted.  Then the priests would eat the contents of the baskets.
Only the owner can make the firstfruits  declaration, with his basket on his shoulder; he must spend the night in Jerusalem, as on all Temple visits.   Those far away from Jerusalem brought dried fruit.  (Abarbanel). 


'''The Harvest of the Earth'''

Yahweh is the Heavenly Farmer (‘husbandman”) who waits for the precious fruit of the earth till it receive the early and the latter rain to bring it to fruition.  He has sown the Seed in the earth and is awaiting a firstfruits harvest.  James 5: 7

Yeshua told a parable about the sower that went out to sow, sowing good seed (His Word) into the field of the world.  The harvest was determined by the type of soil into which it fell.  Matthew 13:1-9
Some of the seed fell along the way and the birds came and ate them.  Other seeds fell on rocky ground but could not gain a foothold in the soil and the sun burned them up.  Other seeds fell among thorns and the thorns grew greater than they and killed them off.  Lo and behold, some of the seeds fell on the good soil and took root and produced a crop suitable for the harvest.  Of all the seeds put out in this parable taught by Yeshua only a small part of them took root, flourished and brought forth fruit to maturity which caused an ongoing multiplication of the original seed sown. 

Those of us who have accepted Yeshua as Messiah and have continued in His Word are the seeds who have found the good soil and taken root and grow on to maturity, reproducing after our kind.   
In times past, present and future, Yahweh is redeeming His people Israel, who like the Israel of old that came out of Egypt, is made up of a mixed multitude who initially respond to the message to become the sons and daughters of the Living God.  However with some the enemy steals the Word of life from their hearts before it takes root, with others they become offended when persecution arises and some become ensnared with the cares of this life and the life of the Word sown is choked off in them.   We are warned  -  “Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God”.  Hebrews 3:12   We need to till the soil of our lives that it may be friable and free of weeds and soak in the rain which falls upon it to enable our lives to bring forth the seed sown to fruition.    “For to this end we toil and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe”.  1 Timothy 4:10

Yahweh’s commitment to the covenant is that He will establish Israel as a Holy Nation and His glorious Bride.  This is just what was promised in Exodus 19  IF we obey His commandments and IF we walk in His ways.  As a result, the other nations of the world will see that we walk in the name of the Holy One and they will give Him glory.  Noting the awesome power of God and seeing Him bless His people will attract the other nations to the light that is coming forth from the nation of Israel.  May we truly represent Him as a kingdom of priests and a holy nation that is interceding for the other nations and displays the light that points all men to Yeshua,  the Light of the world.

      <comment>Added 1: not found error for webimport</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Documentation==
The first place to look in case things go wrong, is the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Zoph documentation wikibook]. The documentation is also included in the docs directory of the Zoph ''tarball''

Some things to check:
* Have you installed all [[Zoph/Requirements|requirements]]?
* Have you followed the correct [[Zoph/Installation|installation]], [[Zoph/Configuration|configuration]] and/or [[Zoph/Upgrading|upgrade]] instructions?

==Debug &amp;amp; Troubleshooting==
For debugging in Zoph 0.8.1 and later, see [[Zoph/Solving Problems/Logging in Zoph 0.8.1 and later]].

You could try turning on Zoph's debug mode by setting the &lt;tt&gt;DEBUG&lt;/tt&gt; setting in &lt;tt&gt;config.inc.php&lt;/tt&gt; to a number higher than 0, the higher the number the more info you get.
Also, check your &lt;tt&gt;php.ini&lt;/tt&gt; for the configurations &lt;tt&gt;display_errors&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;error_reporting&lt;/tt&gt;. PHP may not be showing error messages to you, setting them to.
 error_reporting = E_ALL &amp;amp; ~E_NOTICE&amp;nbsp;
 display_errors = On&lt;/tt&gt;
will ensure that you will see PHP's error messages.
&lt;tt&gt;zophImport.pl&lt;/tt&gt; will tell you more about what it's doing if you add the &lt;tt&gt;--verbose&lt;/tt&gt; commandline option.
In some cases it may help to simplify the issue, for example if &lt;tt&gt;zophImport.pl&lt;/tt&gt; fails, with 4 lines of commandline options, you could try if it still fails if you leave some options out.

==Web import==
One of the parts of Zoph that is likely to cause problems, is the webimport. This is caused by the fact that the webimport depends more on external factors than most other parts of Zoph. In most cases the problems are caused by wrong settings in &lt;tt&gt;php.ini&lt;/tt&gt;, insufficient permissions on the filesystem or missing [[Zoph/Requirements|requirements]]. Also, at this moment the webimport does not sufficiently check for these things and will fail with a PHP error (or sometimes no error at all) instead of a clear error message. This will be fixed in Zoph 0.9, where the whole import section will be rewritten.
Things to check:
* Check if PHP is displaying it's errors (see above for recommended &lt;tt&gt;display_errors&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;error_reporting&lt;/tt&gt; configuration).
* If PHP gives an error see [[Zoph/Solving problems#Common_PHP_Errors|Common PHP Errors]] below.

==Autocomplete==
Another feature that gives some more trouble than other features is the '''autocomplete''' feature. The autocomplete feature heavily relies on Javascript and although I try to test on many different browsers, it's always possible that your browser interpretes the Javascript code a little different than I intended.
Things to try:
* Test with a recent version of Firefox, if possible.
* Try opening http://your.zoph.site/zoph/getxmldata.php?object=album in your browser. It should give an output like
 &lt;albums&gt;
    &lt;album&gt;
       &lt;key&gt;null&lt;/key&gt;
       &lt;title&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/album&gt;
    &lt;album&gt;
       &lt;key&gt;1&lt;/key&gt;
       &lt;title&gt;Album Root&lt;/title&gt;
       &lt;albums&gt;
          &lt;album&gt;
             &lt;key&gt;3&lt;/key&gt;

If you find a browser-related problem (your site works correctly in Firefox, but not in another browser) please [http://www.zoph.org/bugs report a bug].
==Common PHP Errors==
Here are some frequently seen PHP errors. If you get a different error, Try [http://www.google.com Google] or posting a message on the [http://www.zoph.org/forum Zoph Forum].

===GD Missing===
 '''Fatal error''': Call to undefined function imagecreatefromjpeg() in /var/www/html/zoph 
 photo.inc.php on line 468 
You are missing GD support in PHP, Zoph requires GD in order to create mid and thumbnail size images. Check your distribution documentation on how to enable GD. Usually it is a package named something like &lt;tt&gt;php-gd&lt;/tt&gt;.

===Allowed memory size exhausted===
 '''Fatal error''': Allowed memory size of ''&lt;number&gt;'' bytes exhausted (tried to allocate ''&lt;number&gt;'' bytes) in ''&lt;filename&gt;'' on line ''&lt;number&gt;''
PHP is refusing Zoph to use the amount of memory it wants to use. Check your php.ini for this line:
 memory_limit = 16M
and increase this. Zoph could get quite memory hungry while resizing the images or adding watermarks. A rule of thumb is that you should set the memory limit to at least 6x the number of megapixels your (biggest) camera has. So, if you have a 10 Megapixel camera, you should probably set it to 64M.

===Maximum execution time exceeded===
 '''Fatal error''': Maximum execution time of ''&lt;number&gt;'' seconds exceeded in ''&lt;filename&gt;'' on line ''&lt;number&gt;''
PHP has a limit on the time a PHP script is allowed to run. By default it is set on 30 seconds. Since importing of photos usually takes longer than that, you may get this error when trying to import. Increase the time in &lt;tt&gt;php.ini&lt;/tt&gt;
 maximum_execution_time = 120
Since the amount of time Zoph needs to process images is dependant on your webservers CPU speed, load and the size of your photos, a rule of thumb cannot be given. Try increasing the time and/or upload smaller batches of images.

===Webimport fails with with 'not found' error===
 sh: 1 not found
You can see this error when you are using the webimport to upload .ZIP or .TAR files and have set [[Zoph/Configuration#UNZIP_CMD|UNZIP_CMD]] or [[Zoph/Configuration#TAR_CMD|TAR_CMD]] to &lt;tt&gt;'1'&lt;/tt&gt; instead of the tar or unzip command, usually &lt;tt&gt;'unzip'&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;'tar xvf'&lt;/tt&gt;, respectively. Change it in &lt;tt&gt;config.inc.php&lt;/tt&gt; and try again.
==Reporting a bug==
If you suspect that the problem you have run in to is a bug in Zoph, please create a bug report on http://www.zoph.org/bugs.
==Zoph Forum==
There is a Zoph Forum on http://www.zoph.org/forum. You can post a request for help there, of search to see if anyone has had a similar issue.
==Asking for help==
You can really speed up the resolution time of your problem by including relevant information in your forum post or bug report: 
* What were you trying to do?
* Which Zoph version are you running on?
* If the problem started after an upgrade, what was the previous version you were using?
* What OS, PHP version are you running on?
* If it is a browser issue, which browser are you using and have you tried another one?
* Did you see any error messages?
* What have you already tried?
* (Relevant parts of) &lt;tt&gt;config.inc.php&lt;/tt&gt;. '''remove your passwords'''!

      <text xml:space="preserve">=What is MNI_AutoReg?=

In both diagnostic and research applications, the interpretation of magnetic resonance (MR) images of the human brain is facilitated when different data sets can be compared by visual inspection of equivalent anatomical planes. Quantitative analysis with pre-defined atlas templates often requires the initial alignment of atlas and image planes. Unfortunately, the axial planes acquired during separate scanning sessions are often different in their relative position and orientation, and these slices are not coplanar with those in the atlas. A completely automatic method has been developed, based on multi-scale, three dimensional (3D) cross-correlation, to register a given volumetric data set to an average MRI brain (n &gt; 300) aligned with the Talairach stereotaxic coordinate system. Once the data set is resampled by the transformation recovered by the algorithm, atlas slices can be directly super-imposed on the corresponding slices of the resampled volume (see below). The use of such a standardized space also allows the direct comparison, voxel-to-voxel, of two or more data sets brought into stereotaxic space.

A Perl script (mritotal) implements the multi-resolution fitting strategy that has been used to map more than 500 brains into stereotaxic space at the Montreal Neurological Institute. At the heart of this procedure is minctracc, the program that automatically finds the best linear transformation to map one volumetric data set (stored in MINC format, see below) on to another. The program uses optimization over a user selectable number of parameters to identify the best (according to a user-selected objective function) transformation mapping voxel values of the first data set into the second. 


=Using mni_autoreg=

The primary scripts for registration are
* mritotal - the script that calls mincblur and minctracc to achieve stereotaxic registration
* mritoself - intra-subject registration

Other scripts or programs installed are:
* autocrop - for extracting and manipulating bounds of a MINC file
* make_model - generate appropriate blurred and subsampled images required for `mritotal'
* make_phantom - generate ellipsoid or rectangular phantom images
* mincbbox - extract bounding box of image
* mincblur - a program for volumetric convolution with a Gaussian blurring kernel
* mincchamfer - compute a Chamfer distance transform of an image
* minctracc - a program to estimate the transformation required for registration
* xfmtool - perform miscellaneous operations on transform (.xfm) files

Some of these ship with manual pages, and all respond to `-help'.

=Configuration and Protocol Files=

mritotal requires two external files to run. These are the configuration file (mritotal.cfg) and protocol file (default is mritotal.default.cfg, but you can specify others using the -protocol option). If you follow all the above instructions, then these files will be correctly customized and installed for your site.

If things go wrong, though, you should know the following:
* The directory where the configuration and protocol file(s) are installed defaults to /usr/local/bic/etc/mni_autoreg. 
* The location of the model is given in mritotal.cfg (or in mritotal using the -modeldir option).
* If you find it necessary to make a new protocol for your site's data (for instance, if your MRI data consistently covers considerably more than the brain, but the heuristic used by the default protocol doesn't work - see the mritotal man page for more information), then you should copy and change the default protocol file. For instance, you might want to call the protocol &quot;mysite&quot; - in that case, copy mritotal.default.cfg to mritotal.mysite.cfg, and be sure to edit mritotal.cfg so that it uses the new protocol by default. That is, make sure it has &quot;-protocol mysite&quot; instead of &quot;-protocol default&quot;.

=What is registration=

In order to get a better understanding of how mni_autoreg or indeed linear registration works, here is a simple example. Suppose we have an image of an individual and wish to align this with a model. These two images are shown below, the individuals image on the left (indiv.mnc) and model (model.mnc) on the right. Note that both of these files have different sampling and voxel sizes as illustrated by the white lines

[[File:Mni-autoreg_00-source.png|individual image|300px]] [[File:Mni-autoreg-00-model.png|model image|300px]]

Of course being a MINC file, both of these files represent a sampling of a world space (as defined by starts, steps and direction cosines -- use mincinfo to see this). In order to get an understanding of this, our two files are shown again below with their relative position in world space shown in green.

[[File:Mni-autoreg_01-source.png|individual in world space|300px]] [[File:Mni-autoreg_01-model.png|model in world space|300px]]

To get an idea of how they currently overlay I have put them together below

[[File:Mni-autoreg_02-combined.png|combined individual and model images|300px]]

Clearly they are not aligned or &quot;registered&quot; to each other so we have to use a tool such as minctracc or mritoself in order to align them as such:

[[File:Mni-autoreg_03-registered.png|registered version|300px]]

To do this we can use a command such as this:

   minctracc -lsq9 indiv.mnc model.mnc align.xfm

The -lsq9 argument here is instructing minctracc to recover 3 rotations, 3 translations and 3 scales. Note that the output of this step is not an aligned image but an output (linear) transform file which contains a 4x4 tranformation matrix. This consists of a 3x3 affine transformation plus 3 translations should they be needed. An example of one of these files is below:

   MNI Transform File
   
   Transform_Type = Linear;
   Linear_Transform = 
    0.995668319594959 -0.30943698305448 0.0180935790540566 8.9918311534818
    0.320977051206147 0.94080272211886 0.00947446085537751 -39.3894632128575
    -0.0222220364958048 -0.00403786869719625 1.15379667282104 -33.4353790283203;

A MNI transform file has an implied 4th line consisting of 0,0,0,1 but this data is not stored in the file. To get an idea of what a decomposition of this matrix could be we can use xfm2param:

   xfm2param align.xfm

This will produce output like the below:

   after parameter extraction
   -center         0.00000    0.00000    0.00000
   -translation    8.99183  -39.38946  -33.43538
   -rotation      -0.20051    1.10337   17.25793
   -scale          1.04280    0.99372    1.15402
   -shear          0.02764   -0.00000   -0.00000

So now that we have our transformation we need to resample our original input data. To do this we use mincresample, however we have a few choices to make regarding the sampling of the output file. The first and most commonly used would be as such:

   mincresample -like model.mnc -transformation align.xfm source.mnc resampled.mnc

Note that the output file now has the same sampling as the original model.

[[File:Mni-autoreg_04-resample1.png|resampled using like|300px]]

The next option is as such:

   mincresample -tfm_input_sampling -transformation align.xfm source.mnc resampled.mnc

This instructs mincresample to resample the original sampling of the file by the input transformation, note that this will result in a file with direction co-sines.

[[File:Mni-autoreg_04-resample2.png|resampled using tfm|300px]]

The final option is to use the original sampling of the individual as such:

   mincresample -use_input_sampling -transformation align.xfm source.mnc resampled.mnc

Using this method will keep the original sampling but also the original position of the file meaning you may or may not keep a full &quot;covering&quot; of the file.
 
[[File:Mni-autoreg_04-resample3.png|resampled using orig|300px]]

It is for this reason that the -like option is the most used approach as it then also allows further processing to be done on the resulting resampled file using voxel based tools such as minccalc and mincmath

* &lt;font size=3&gt;Belarus became an independent country after the former Soviet Union broke up in 1991. Meter stamps with Soviet markings continued to be used in Belarus after independence. See SOVIET UNION for these stamps. Covered here are only stamp designs introduced since independence and inscribed “BELARUS” or “БЕПАРУСъ” or without country inscription but with Belarus town mark.
* The stamps are grouped according to appearance and usage:
:: '''A''' - Provisional issues without country inscription in the frank, or with old Soviet Union identification (&quot;CCCP&quot;) but modified in some way to indicate the change in status
:: '''B''' - Frank is octagon inscribed “BELARUS” or “БЕЛАРУСЬ” 
:: '''C''' - Frank is rectangle
:: '''PO''' - Special stamps generated only in Post Offices
&lt;/font&gt;

= Dissemination and Public Relations =

== What is PR? ==
[[Image:Nuvola_apps_filetypes.svg|right|thumb|200px|]]

Much like marketing, public relations is a way for an organization to connect with interested parties not directly involved with the project to gather support. 

=== Why do it? ===
Public relations to interested parties and stakeholders can make or break any project.  Unless you somehow have infinite resources, your project will be competing with others for monetary and staffing resources.  The key to continuing your project is to keep the interested parties interested by telling them how the project is progressing at various intervals, by showing them why is it important, by motivating them to speak up about what you are doing.

=== Who to PR to ===
All generations in every venue for public relations should be contacted.  In today's educational world parents age can range from their 20s to 50s, depending on when they have their children.  Also politicians, sponsors, funders, school boards, colleges and students may be able to help your message reach the community.

The extensiveness of the Public Relations plan will be determined by the budget given by the school district or the ability for one to reach out to the community for support and available free dissemination channels.

=== What to report ===
A well planned project is divided into phases, each of which will have its own traceable milestones.  Since it's critical to give the appearance of success, be sure to include any foreseeable obstacles in the projected progress at the beginning of the PR campaign.  For example, switching from a Mac to a PC based system will undoubtedly involve some sort of learning curve for learners and teachers alike.  If this was anticipated in the plan, then it's perfectly reasonable to report success at meeting expectations even when progress is slow in the beginning.

=== Elements of Good Public Relations: ===
1.  A mission statement that expresses the purpose of the project, the goals and the projected timeline in accomplishing those goals and objectives.

2.  At the beginning of the implementation, emphasizing the goals and objectives, announcing the potential completion of the project. 

3.  Continuous stream of communication to all parties involved, as appropriate for the timeline of the project. Monthly communication for longer projects is recommended.

4.  Incorporation of the potential students who will benefit from the project will not only create excitement from the student body, it will also convey a sense of importance to them and their parents, who are the ultimate support in the economic phase of the project.

5.  Once a certain point of development and certain milestones have been reached, a special communication or event should be planned.  Milestones are a measurable way to announce any advancements and changes to the project and their effect on the timeline.

6.  A grand opening or a completion announcement is important for the overall success. It will boost morale and encourage continued support from the community for future projects.

=== PR Tools ===
Using diverse methods to reach the public is critical.  One must search many different vehicles of communication in order to reach multiple level of audiences, starting from the most traditional, such as press releases to local papers, articles to interested magazines, public service announcements for radio stations, local community programming on television, newsletters (hard copy and via e-mails), blogs, email or YouTube videos.

According to Personal Relations expert, Peter Smith, &quot;the growing influence of consumer-generated media (CGM), including blogs, online forums, podcasts, and other social media tools, has changed the environment in which public relations practitioners conduct campaigns for their clients and connect with their stakeholders. Rather than working solely with journalists to reach publics—practitioners are now becoming “part of the quirky blogging community [to be] aware of how their organization or client is being discussed” [http://www.allacademic.com/one/www/research/index.php?cmd=Download+Document&amp;key=unpublished_manuscript&amp;file_index=31&amp;pop_up=true&amp;no_click_key=true&amp;attachment_style=attachment&amp;PHPSESSID=d869702101bb88a7a6040d0814742e0e] (Porter, et. al, 2007, p. 94).

'''Some Examples'''

Blogs, such as the One Laptop Per Child project's blog: http://www.olpcnews.com/

Tours. such as those given by Philadelphia's school of the future http://www.microsoft.com/education/schoolofthefuture/

YouTube videos, such as this one from a program in Maryland, operated by United Cerebral Palsy of Prince George's and Montgomery Counties with funding from NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center. &quot;The program encourages high school students with disabilities to pursue careers in science, engineering and high technology.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[w:Spring_Framework|Spring]] is an application framework for Java.  Spring is an [[w:Inversion_of_Control|IoC]] container that allows for a different programming model.  Spring is similar to a JEE server, in that it provides a transaction service, XML deployment, annotation processing, byte-code weaving, and JPA integration.

==Persistence==
Persistence in Spring in normally done through a DAO (Data Access Object) layer.  The Spring DAO layer is meant to encapsulate the persistence mechanism, so the same application data access API would be given no matter if JDBC, JPA or a native API were used.

Spring also defines a transaction manager implementation that is similar to JTA.  Spring also supports transactional annotations and beans similar to SessionBeans.

==JPA==
Spring has specific support for JPA and can emulate some of the functionality of a JEE container with respect to JPA.  Spring allows a JPA persistence unit to be deployed in container managed mode.  If the spring-agent is used to start the JVM, Spring can deploy a JPA persistence unit with weaving similar to a JEE server.  Spring can also pass a Spring DataSource and integrate its transaction service with JPA.  Spring allows the &lt;code&gt;@PersistenceUnit&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;@PersistenceContext&lt;/code&gt; annotations to be used in any Spring bean class, to have an &lt;code&gt;EntityManager&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;EntityManagerFactory&lt;/code&gt; injected.  Spring supports a managed transactional &lt;code&gt;EntityManager&lt;/code&gt; similar to JEE, where the &lt;code&gt;EntityManager&lt;/code&gt; binds itself as a new persistence context to each new transaction and commits as part of the transaction.  Spring supports both JTA integration, and its own transaction manager.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Motion==
Motion refers to the movement of an object from one position to another position 

==Motion's Characteristics==
If there is a Force F that makes an object of Mass m to move a Distance s within Time t Then 

* Speed
: The ratio of Distance over Time gives Speed of Motion 
: &lt;math&gt;v = \frac{s}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

* Acceleration
: The ratio of Speed over time gives Acceleration of the motion
: &lt;math&gt;a = \frac{v}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

* Distance
: Distance travels of the motion is defined as the product of Mass times Acceleration
: S = v t = a t&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

* Force
: Force causing the Motion
: F = m a = m v t = p t

* Work Done
: Work done by the force is the product of the Force and the Distance travel 
: W = F s F v t = p v

* Energy
: Work done by the force is the product of the Force and the Distance travel 
: &lt;math&gt;E = \frac{W}{t} = \frac{F s}{t} = F v = p a&lt;/math&gt;

==Types of Motion==

&lt;font size=3&gt;When the country gained independence from Great Britain in 1987 the name was changed from British Honduras to Belize. No meter franks seen so far include the country name. The stamps can be identified by “B.H.” (British Honduras), “BELIZE” or “BELIZE CITY” in the town mark.
The first meter was installed in 1967.&lt;/font&gt;

The &quot;Hobbit monitor&quot; has been renamed the &quot;[http://www.xymon.com/ Xymon monitor]&quot;: see http://www.hswn.dk/hobbiton/2008/11/msg00123.html for details.

Therefore I suggest merging the [[Hobbit Design Document]] into [[System Monitoring with Xymon]].

Sure, This this is a good suggestion, I lost that [[Hobbit Design Document]] URL, will do what I have some free time. [[User:Tjyang|Tjyang]]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Non Linear Motion==
Non Linear Motion refers to any non straight line motion with changing direction 

==Characteristics==
For any Non Linear Motion can be represented mathematically as a function of speed in time, v(t) then

* Speed
: v = v(t)

* Accelleration
: &lt;math&gt;a = \frac{d v(t)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

* Distance
: &lt;math&gt;s = \int v(t) dt&lt;/math&gt;

* Force
: &lt;math&gt;F = m \frac{d v(t)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

* Work Done
: &lt;math&gt;W = F \times s = F \int v(t) dt&lt;/math&gt;

* Energy
: &lt;math&gt;W = \frac{F}{t} = \frac{F}{t} \int v(t) dt&lt;/math&gt;

The Student Health Insurance Program strives to maintain a confidential, compassionate, sensitive environment where all students can receive assistance with insurance questions and claims. The result will be students who understand how to make informed decisions about their individual health insurance needs.
Students preferring to waive the UNC Student Health Insurance Plan and premium cost from their tuition/fees billing, must be enrolled in a comparable health insurance plan and are REQUIRED to complete an online waiver through URSA.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Selecting a Manageable Dissertation Topic==
The first thing to remember when considering a dissertation topic is the purpose of your dissertation.  The Dissertation Handbook says, “The goal of the dissertation is to make a significant, original contribution to knowledge.  In every respect, the document is to of publishable quality.  A dissertation should represent, where appropriate, the most advanced or recent methodologies, theoretical advances, and innovations in the discipline.”  With that in mind, you need to first of all choose a topic about which you are curious and can foresee spending a considerable amount of time exploring.  Many people will have ideas for you, but you need to choose something that gets you excited!  You also need to choose a topic about which you can contribute new information.  You do not have to make ground-breaking discoveries (though you might!), but you do have to look at your topic in a way that no one else has.  Also keep in mind as you work to choose a topic that your dissertation does not have to be your life’s work.  You will have your entire career to be a researcher.  Start with one, focused, doable topic for your dissertation and work to be the best researcher and writer you can be.  Then you will have that strong foundation to take with you into your career as you pursue other research.  Also, it is often very helpful to talk with your Research Advisor and other graduate students as you work to select a topic.  Often, outside perspective will help to focus and frame your topic and research questions.
