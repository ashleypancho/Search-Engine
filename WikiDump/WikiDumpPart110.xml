      <text xml:space="preserve">== DALI ==

DALI stands for Distance Alignment Matrix Method. DALI is a common and popular method that breaks down the protein that is inputted into hexapeptide fragments and then calculates a distance matrix through the understanding of the contact pattern between successive fragments. Secondary structure features with residues that are contiguous in sequence are shown on the matrix's main diagonal. The other diagonals represent residues that are not next to each other in sequence. When the diagonals are parallel to the main diagonal, the features they represent are also parallel. When the diagonals are perpendicular, however, their features are anti parallel.
If two proteins' distance matrices are the same or share similar features in almost the same positions, they can be said to have similar folds and length loops connecting the secondary structure elements. When two matrices are built, DALI's actual alignment process involves conducting a series of overlapping sub matrices that are 6x6. These 6x6 matrices are then reassembled to a final alignment through a standard score-maximization algorithm.
The DALI method has been used to construct the FSSP database (Fold classification based on structure-structure alignments of proteins, or families of structurally similar proteins). This database holds all known protein structures and aligns them with each other to determine structural neighbors and fold classification. This database information can easily be found on the internet for ease of access. A DALI online database can found [http://ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali/start| here.] A [http://ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali_lite/downloads/download.html downloadable program] and [http://ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali_server/start| web search] are other available DALI resources.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Combinatorial Extension==

The combinatorial extension (CE) method is like the DALI method in that it breaks each structure into a series of fragments and attempts to reassemble them into a complete alignment. Pairwise combinations of fragments, named aligned fragment pairs, or AFPs, are used to make a similarity matrix where an optimal path is generated to identify the final alignment. To reduce the amount of searching and increase efficiency, only AFPs that meet a criteria for local similarity are used in the matrix. The first CE method only included structural superpositions and inter-residue distances but has been grown to include local environmental properties like secondary structure, solvent exposure, hydrogen-bonding patterns, and dihedral angles.
An alignment path is the optimal path that is calculated through a similarity matrix by linear progression through the sequences and extending the alignment with a possible high-scoring AFP pair. The initial AFP pair that nucleates the alignment can occur at any place in the sequence matrix. This is then extended with AFPs that meet the given distance criteria which restricts the alignment to low gap sizes. The size of each AFP and maximum gap size are required input parameters that are usually set to the empirically determined values of 8 and 30, respectively. An all-to-all fold classification database from known protein structures in the PDB has been constructed using CE.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== SSAP ==

[[Image:Ssap-vectors.png|frame|Illustration of the atom-to-atom vectors calculated in SSAP. From these vectors, a series of vector differences can be constructed, for example, between (FA) in Protein 1 and (SI) in Protein 2. The two sequences are plotted on the two dimensions of a matrix to form a difference matrix between the two proteins. Dynamic programming is applied to all possible difference matrices to build a series of optimal local alignment paths that are summed to form the summary matrix, on which a second round of dynamic programming is performed.]]
SSAP stands for Sequential Structure Alignment Program. SSAP method uses double dynamic programming to produce structural alignment based on atom to atom vectors in structure space. SSAP constructs the vectors using the beta carbons for all residues by glycine, instead of the alpha carbons typically used, which thus takes into account the rotameric state of each residue and its location along the backbone. SSAP first constructs a series of inter-residue distance vectors between each residue and its nearest non-contiguous neighbors on each protein. A series of matrices is then constructed containing the vector differences between neighbors for each pair of residues for which the vectors were constructed. Using dynamic programming on each resulting matrix determines a series of optimal local alignments, which are then mixed together into a &quot;summary&quot; matrix to which dynamic programming is again used to determine overall structural alignment.
SSAP originally gave only pairwise alignments, but can now provide multiple alignments. It has been used to produce a hierarchical fold classification known as CATH (Class, Architecture, Topology, Homology) through an all-to-all comparison of proteins. This has then been used to put together a CATH protein structure classification database. The constructed database can found [http://cl.sdsc.edu/| here.]

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Programs Used for Structural Alignment ==

[[File:Alignment of thioredoxins2.png|thumb|300px|right|Structural alignment of thioredoxins from humans and Drosophilia Melanogaster. Human protein is in red, fly protein in yellow.]]
Although somewhat complex, the programs and methods used in structural alignment are quite interesting and hold a wealth of information to be learned. Most of the programs involve matrices and seemingly complex mathematical procedures. Although this holds the difficulty of complex mathematics, it is interesting to see how the structural alignment of proteins is determined and also what each method specifically finds out.

The goal of structural alignment techniques has been to compare individual structures, sets of structures, or an &quot;all-to-all&quot; comparison database that measures the divergence between every pair of structures present in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The worldwide protein data bank can be found here at [http://www.wwpdb.org/  this website.] These databases generally classify proteins based on their folding.

Certain methods differ in the amount of points that are given to each correct protein alignment and the amount of points deducted from each incorrect protein alignment. For instance, Glutamine and Asparagine are both polar and have a very similar hydropathy index, so, if Glutamine is present where an Asparagine should be, less points would be deducted than if, say, Valine were there. This type of method allows maximum amount of points to be granted for alignments which change the structure or function of the protein the least. The points granted for each alignment can be compared to other alignments in order to better understand how closely related certain proteins are to one another in structure or function.

== VMD ==

A way to actually compare two structures is to use VMD (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/).
VMD stands for Virtual Molecular Dynamics. One can load a pdb file using VMD and go to file-&gt;add a structure.
VMD uses RMSD structural alignment to compare two structures.
RMSD stands for Root Mean Square Distance and it compares the distances of the atoms.
Lower the RMSD values of two proteins, the more aligned.

== DALI ==

DALI involves the breaking of the input protein structure into hexapeptide fragments which are then inputted in a distance matrix that evaluates contact patterns between successive fragments. The DALI method has been used to determine structural neighbors and fold classification.

== Combinatorial Extension ==

Combinatorial Extension (CE) breaks each protein into a series of fragments and attempts to reassemble them into a complete alignment. This method can be used for structural superpositions, inter-residue distances, secondary structure, solvent exposure, hydrogen-bonding patterns, and dihedral angles.

== SSAP ==

SSAP uses double dynamic programming to produce a structural alignment based on atom-to-atom vectors in structure space. In the first step, SSAP will perform inter-residue distance vectors and adjacent non-related neighboring proteins. The dynamic programming on each matrix produce local alignments that are then recorded onto a summary matrix to determine the overall structural alignment. A SSAP score ranging 80-100 explain highly similar structures whereas scores falling between 70-80 are slightly similar with few deviations. Scores 60-70 may contain the same tertiary structure, but the class may vary.

*Beiber*

The *Beiber* method is a combinatorial algorithm for non-sequential structural alignment of proteins and similarity search in databases. This method focuses on secondary structure to evaluate similarities between two different protein structures based on contact maps.

== MAMMOTH ==

MAMMOTH's purpose was originally developed for comparing models coming from structure prediction, but now also works well with experimental models. MAMMOTH has been used to create a large database covering predicted structures of unknown proteins for 150 genomes which allows for genomic scale normalization.

== RAPIDO ==

RAPIDO is a web based program for analyzing three dimensional crystal structures of different protein molecules in the presence of conformational changes. This method involves the calculation of difference distance matrices between fragments that are structurally similar in two different proteins.

== SABERTOOTH ==

SABERTOOTH uses structural profiles to perform structural alignments. This tool recognizes structural similarities with accuracy and quality compared to that of other established alignment tools based on coordinates.

== BLOSUM ==
BLOSUM stands for Blocks of Amino Acid Substitution Matrix uses an assigned score based on the observed frequencies of such occurrences in alignment related proteins. Certain scores may be added with values of either positive or negative value. This scale is then run by a log odd ratio. In essence, two matrices are compared and evaluated by the ratio of similar or identical sequences to the ratio of unknowns missed by one.

== TOPOFIT ==

TOPOFIT analyzes protein structures based on three dimensional Delaunay triangulation patterns derived from backbone representation. TOPOFIT produces a structural alignment of proteins based on the fact that proteins have a common spatial invariant part (a set of tetrahedrons) which is mathematically described as a common spatial sub-graph volume of three dimensional contact graph derived from Delaunay tessellation (DT).

== InsightII ==

insightII is a molecular modeling package developed by Biosym. The programs included include Insight II, BioPolymer, Analysis, and Discover. InsightII therefore is a comprehensive program that can not only build any class of molecule or molecule system, but with the molecular mechanics program Discover, can manipulate these same molecules.

Insight II is primarily used for visualization. It creates, modifies, manipulates, displays, and analyzes molecular systems. Insight II essentially provides the core requirements for all software modules. Analysis revolves around mathmatical and geometric modeling of molecular properties. Molecular properties are defined interactively, evaluated dynamically, and visualized interactively through spreadsheets, graphs, and graphic representations. BioPolymer constructs models of polymers—peptides, proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids—for visualing complex structures and use in further simulation work. CHARMM is a simulation program available within insight II that uses energy functions to describe the forces on atoms in molecules.  This allows for calculation of interaction and conformational energies, free energy, and vibrational frequencies.

Through use of the Discover program, one can optimize the structure of the molecule or protein being viewed. This is due to the fact that it incorporates a range of well validated forcefields for dynamics simulations, minimization, and conformational searches. This allows for the ability to extrapolate the structure, energetics, and properties of systems, be they organic, inorganic, organometallic, or biological. Because of this program, it is possible to take the sequence of a protein and from that extrapolate a rudimentary structure from it. Discover also implements Inter Process Communications which allow for Discover turn over control to external programs and retrieve those results, inforperating them into continuing Discover computations.

=== Tagalog ===

Bahay kubo, kahit munti &lt;br/&gt;
Ang halaman doon, ay sari sari &lt;br/&gt;
Singkamas at talong, sigarilyas at mani &lt;br/&gt;
Sitaw, bataw, patani. &lt;br/&gt;
kundol, patola, upo't kalabasa. at saka meron pa, labanos, mustasa. 
sibuyas, kamatis, bawang at luya, sa paligid-ligid ay puro linga.

      <text xml:space="preserve">International political economy is concerned with the ways in which political forces (states, institutions, individual actors, etc.) shape the systems through which economic interactions are expressed, and conversely the effects that economic interactions (including the power of collective markets and individuals acting both within and outside them) have upon political structures and outcomes. The major theoretical perspectives in international political economy are Mercantilsm, liberalism, Marxism and constructivism.

== Mercantilsm/realism ==
Mercantilsm is similar to International relations realism.

These attractive green gnocchi originated in Tuscany where, confusingly, they were known as ravioli.

==Ingredients==
* 12 oz. cooked [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]], well drained and finely chopped
* 1 container (8 oz) [[Cookbook:Ricotta|Ricotta]], mashed until smooth
* 2 [[Cookbook:Eggs|eggs]]
* 1 cup freshly grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]]
* 3 tbsp. [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 5 tbsp. [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] melted, [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] and [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]

==Procedure==

===Gnocchi===
* Put the spinach, ricotta and seasoning in a saucepan and cook gently, stirring continuously, for 5 minutes.
* Turn off the heat, and beat in the eggs, the 3 tbsp. of the Parmesan and the flour.
* Chill the mixture for at least 4 hours.
* Lightly shape into small rounds and roll them into a very small amount of flour.
* [[Cookbook:Poaching|Poach]] them in water until they float to the surface. Drain and set aside.

===Sauce===
* I'll finish this tonight. Computer is dying.</text>

A prime ingredient of any 3D design flow is the ability to import from and export to other tools.  The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format) STL file format] is currently the most common format used.

=== import ===

Imports a file for use in the current OpenSCAD model

'''Parameters'''

; &amp;lt;file&amp;gt; : A string containing the path to the STL or DXF file.

'''Usage examples:'''
 
 import(&quot;example012.stl&quot;);

Notes: In the latest version of OpenSCAD, import() is now used for importing both 2D (DXF for extrusion) and 3D (STL) files.


If you want to render the imported STL file later, you have to make sure that the STL file is &quot;clean&quot;. This means that the mesh has to be manifold and should not contain holes nor self-intersections. If the STL is not clean, you might get errors like:


CGAL error in CGAL_Build_PolySet: CGAL ERROR: assertion violation!

Expr: check_protocoll == 0

File: /home/don/openscad_deps/mxe/usr/i686-pc-mingw32/include/CGAL/Polyhedron_incremental_builder_3.h

Line: 199


or


CGAL error in CGAL_Nef_polyhedron3(): CGAL ERROR: assertion violation!

Expr: pe_prev-&gt;is_border() || !internal::Plane_constructor&lt;Plane&gt;::get_plane(pe_prev-&gt;facet(),pe_prev-&gt;facet()-&gt;plane()).is_degenerate()

File: /home/don/openscad_deps/mxe/usr/i686-pc-mingw32/include/CGAL/Nef_3/polyhedron_3_to_nef_3.h

Line: 253


In order to clean the STL file, you have the following options:

- use http://wiki.netfabb.com/Semi-Automatic_Repair_Options  . This will repair the holes but not the self-intersections.

- use netfabb basic. This free software doesnt have the option to close holes nor can it fix the self-intersections

- use MeshLab, This free software can fix all the issues


Using MeshLab, you can do:

- Render - Show non Manif Edges

- Render - Show non Manif Vertices

- if found, use Filters - Selection - Select non Manifold Edges or Select non Manifold Vertices - Apply - Close. Then click button 'Delete the current set of selected vertices...' or check http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDx0Tgy0UHo for an instruction video. The screen should show &quot;0 non manifold edges&quot;, &quot;0 non manifold vertices&quot;


Next, you can click the icon 'Fill Hole', select all the holes and click Fill and then Accept. You might have to redo this action a few times.

Use File - Export Mesh to save the STL.

=== import_stl ===
&lt;DEPRECATED.. Use the command '''import''' instead..&gt;

Imports an STL file for use in the current OpenSCAD model

'''Parameters'''

; &amp;lt;file&amp;gt; : A string containing the path to the STL file to include.

; &amp;lt;convexity&amp;gt; : Integer. The convexity parameter specifies the maximum number of front sides (back sides) a ray intersecting the object might penetrate. This parameter is only needed for correctly displaying the object in OpenCSG preview mode and has no effect on the polyhedron rendering.

'''Usage examples:'''
 
 import_stl(&quot;example012.stl&quot;, convexity = 5);

=== STL Export ===

To export your design, select &quot;Export as STL...&quot; from the &quot;File --&gt; Export&quot; menu, then enter a filename in the ensuing dialog box.  Don't forget to add the &quot;.stl&quot; extension.

'''Trouble shooting''':

After ''compile and render GCAL'' (F6), you may see that your design is ''simple: no''. That's bad news.

See line 8 in the following output from ''OpenSCAD 2010.02'':

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
Parsing design (AST generation)...
Compiling design (CSG Tree generation)...
Compilation finished.
Rendering Polygon Mesh using CGAL...
Number of vertices currently in CGAL cache: 732
Number of objects currently in CGAL cache: 12
   Top level object is a 3D object:
   Simple:         no                &lt;*****************
   Valid:         yes
   Vertices:       22
   Halfedges:      70
   Edges:          35
   Halffacets:     32
   Facets:         16
   Volumes:         2
Total rendering time: 0 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds
Rendering finished.
&lt;/source&gt;

When you try to export this to .STL you will get a message like:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
Object isn't a valid 2-manifold! Modify your design..
&lt;/source&gt;

&quot;Manifold&quot; means that it is &quot;water tight&quot; and that there are no holes in the geometry.
In a valid 2-manifold each edge must connect exactly two facets.  That means that the program must be able to connect a face with an object. E.g. if you use a cube of height 10 to carve out something from a wider cube of height 10, it is not clear to which cube the top or the bottom belongs. So make the small extracting cube a bit &quot;longer&quot; (or &quot;shorter&quot;):
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
difference() {
	// original
	cube (size = [2,2,2]);
	// object that carves out
	# translate ([0.5,0.5,-0.5]) {
	    cube (size = [1,1,3]);	
	}
}
&lt;/source&gt;

[[file:openscad-difference-cube-example.png|frame|none|Correct use of difference]]

Here is a more tricky little example taken from the [http://rocklinux.net/pipermail/openscad/2009-December/000018.html OpenSCAD] Forum (retrieved 15:13, 22 March 2010 (UTC)):
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
module example1() {
		cube([20, 20, 20]);
		translate([-20, -20, 0]) cube([20, 20, 20]);
		cube([50, 50, 5], center = true);
	}
module example2() {
		cube([20.1, 20.1, 20]);
		translate([-20, -20, 0]) cube([20.1, 20.1, 20]);
		cube([50, 50, 5], center = true);
	}
&lt;/source&gt;

Example1 would render like this:
[[file:openscad-no-simple-object.png|frame|none|A not valid 2-manifold cube (simple = no)]]

The '''example1''' module is not a valid 2-manifold because both cubes are
sharing one edge. They touch each other but do not intersect.

'''Example2''' is a valid 2-manifold because there is an intersection. Now the construct meets the 2-manifold constraint stipulating that ''each edge
must connect exactly two facets.'' 

Pieces you are subtracting must extend past the original part. ([http://www.iheartrobotics.com/2010/01/openscad-tip-manifold-space-and-time.html OpenSCAD Tip: Manifold Space and Time], retrieved 18:40, 22 March 2010 (UTC)).

For reference, another situation that causes the design to be non-exportable is when two faces that are each the result of a subtraction touch. Then the error message comes up.
&lt;source lang=text&gt;
difference () {
   cube ([20,10,10]);
   translate ([10,0,0]) cube (10);
}
difference () {
   cube ([20,10,10]);
   cube (10);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
simply touching surfaces is correctly handled. 
&lt;source lang=text&gt;
translate ([10,0,0]) cube (10);
cube (10);
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== O-GlcNAc ==

[[File:O-GlcNAc2.pdf|right|thumb|O-GlcNAc.]]

β-linked N-acetylglucosamine is also known as O-GlcNAc. It is an intercellular cabohydrate that dynamiclly modifies proteins in the nucleous and cytoplasm on the Serine and Threonine residues (Hart). The regulation of O-GlcNAc is dependent on only two enzymes OGT and O-GlcNacase (Hart). 
The difference between O-GlcNAc and many forms of protein glycosylation are:
a.O-GlcNAcylation occurs only in the cytoplasm and nuclease
b.It is not an elongated structure
c.It is attached and removed several times in the life of a (Hart.
It was discovered in 1983 (Hart). It is present all muticellular organisms,but not in yeast, for example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Hart).



== O-GlcNAcylation ==

[[File:O-GlcNAc1.pdf|right|thumb|O-GlcNAc.]]

O-GlcNAcylation shares more similarities to phosphoylation than other forms of protein phosphorylation. The interplay between O-GlcNAc and O-phosphate is fact, that protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PP1c). The enzyme that removes O-phosphate also regulates OGT. This suggests that the enzyme can remove the phosphate group and attach the O-GlcNAc. The monosaccharide B-N-Acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc) attaches to serine/threonine residues via an O-linked glycosidic bond. 

== O-GlcNAcylation in Alzheimers ==
O-GlcNAcylation regulation has been proven to been an important factor in Alzheimer Disease patients as shown in the article done by Department of Neurochemistry, New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities. (F.Liu, K.Iqbal, I.Grundke-Iqbal, G.W. Hart, and Cheng-Xin Gong) A microtubule associated protein, Tau, is &quot;hyperphosphorylated and aggregated into a neurofibillary tangle in Alzheimer diseased brain&quot;.{{ref|O-GlcNAcylation In Alzheimers}}The protein tau is modified by O-GlcNAcylation through process described in previous paragraph. The phosphoryl site-specificity of tau is both regulated in vitro and in vivo. Experiments were ran to show that the inverse affect that occurs when levels of O-GlcNAcylation occurs.

== Starving Mouse Experiment ==
This experiment tested the affects of decreased glucose leading to decrease in O-GlcNAcylation. The mice starved for 48h as a result decreasing brain supply of glucose. The environment of the mouse was in a cage with prevention of coprophagy. There is a reduction in cellular concentration of UDP-Glucose consequently the protein of O-GlcNAcylation. In the experiment a I(125) Western blot is ran with anti-GlcNAcyl antibodies.{{ref|O-GlcNAcylation In Alzheimers}}The tau phosphorylation increases suggesting an overall inverse regulation of tau phosphorylation by O-GlcNAcylation. The mouse's brain neurofilaments had an increased level of tau phosphorylation due to the decrease of tau O-GlcNAcylation in the brain. This is the result of deficient glucose uptake and utilization.

[[File:Starvingmice.jpg|right|thumb|Starving Mouse Experiment.]]

== O-GlcNAc Transferase ==
The catalyst that attaches O-GlcNAc from the UDP-GlcNAc substrate to either a Serine or Theronine residue forming a β-glycosidic linkage is the O-GlcNAc  tranferase(OGT) (Hart).
Mammals seem to have only one gene that catalysis the OGT.  There is a dependent relationship between OGT and viability of the embryonic stem cells. In the absence O-GlcNacylation in the mammalian cells is lethal (Hart).
The complex regularion of OGT has not been clearly defined.  But, it has been discovred that OGT is O-GlcNAcylated and phosphorylated (Hart).

== O-GlcNAcase ==

Nucleocytoplasmic β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase) is the enzyme that removes O-GlcNAc from a protein (Hart).

=== For Loop ===

Iterate over the values in a vector or range.

'''Vector version:''' for (variable=&lt;vector&gt;) &lt;do_something&gt; - &lt;variable&gt; is assigned to each successive value in the vector&lt;br/&gt;
'''Range version:''' for (variable=&lt;range&gt;) &lt;do_something&gt;

'''Nested loops''' :
for ( variable1 = &lt;range or vector&gt;, variable2 = &lt;range or vector&gt; ) &lt;do something, using both variables&gt;
&lt;br&gt;for loops can be nested, just as in normal programs. A shorthand is that both iterations can be given in the same for statement

=== Intersection For Loop ===
Iterate over the values in a vector or range and take an [[OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language#intersection|intersection]] of the contents.

'''Note:''' &lt;code&gt;intersection_for()&lt;/code&gt; is a work around because of an issue that you cannot get the expected results using a combination of the standard &lt;code&gt;for()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;intersection()&lt;/code&gt; statements. The reason is that &lt;code&gt;for()&lt;/code&gt; do a implicit &lt;code&gt;union()&lt;/code&gt; of the contents.

'''Parameters'''

; &amp;lt;loop variable name&amp;gt; : Name of the variable to use within the '''for''' loop. 

{| width=&quot;100%&quot;
|'''Usage example 1 - loop over a range:'''

=== If Statement ===

Conditionally evaluate a sub-tree.

'''Parameters'''

* The boolean expression that should be used as condition

'''NOTE:''' 

Do not confuse the assignment operator '=' with the equal operator '==' 

 if (a=b) dosomething();  // WRONG - this will FAIL to be processed without any error message
 if (a==b) dosomething(); // CORRECT - this will do something if a equals b

'''Usage example:'''
 &lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot; &gt;
if (x &gt; y)
{
    cube(size = 1, center = false);
} else {
    cube(size = 2, center = true);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Assign Statement ===

Set variables to a new value for a sub-tree.

'''Parameters'''

* The variables that should be (re-)assigned

'''Usage example:'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
for (i = [10:50])
{
    assign (angle = i*360/20, distance = i*10, r = i*2)
    {
        rotate(angle, [1, 0, 0])
        translate([0, distance, 0])
        sphere(r = r);
    }
}

For including code from external files in OpenSCAD, there are two commands available:

* '''&lt;code&gt;include &lt;''filename''&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' acts as if the contents of the included file were written in the including file, and
* '''&lt;code&gt;use &lt;''filename''&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' imports modules and functions, but does not execute any commands other than those definitions.

Library files are searched for in the same folder as the design was open from, or in the library folder of the OpenSCAD installation. You can use a relative path specification to either. If they lie elsewhere you must give the complete path.
Newer versions have predefined user libraries, see the [[OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Libraries]] page, which also documents a number of library files included in OpenSCAD.

Windows and Linux/Mac use different separators for directories. Windows uses '''\''', e.g. directory\file.ext, while the others use '''/''', e.g. directory/file.ext. This could lead to cross platform issues. However OpenSCAD on Windows correctly handles the use of '''/''', so using '''/''' in all '''include''' or '''use''' statements will work on all platforms.

Using '''&lt;code&gt;include &lt;''filename''&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' allows default variables to be specified in the library. These defaults can be overridden in the main code. An openscad variable only has one value during the life of the program. When there are multiple assignments it takes the last value, but assigns when the variable is first created. This has an effect when assigning in a library, as any ''variables'' which you later use to change the default, must be assigned before the include statement. See the second example below.

A library file for generating rings might look like this (defining a function and providing an example):

'''ring.scad:'''

 module ring(r1, r2, h) {
     difference() {
         cylinder(r = r1, h = h);
         translate([ 0, 0, -1 ]) cylinder(r = r2, h = h+2);
     }
 }
 
 ring(5, 4, 10);

Including the library using

 include &lt;ring.scad&gt;;
 rotate([90, 0, 0]) ring(10, 1, 1);

would result in the example ring being shown in addition to the rotated ring, but

 use &lt;ring.scad&gt;;
 rotate([90, 0, 0]) ring(10, 1, 1);

only shows the rotated ring.

If using the use function, make sure to place the use statements at top of the file, or at least not within a module!

This will work fine:
  
  // a.scad
  use &lt;ring.scad&gt;;
  module a() {
    ring();
  }

but this will result in an syntax error:

  //a.scad
  module a() {
    use &lt;ring.scad&gt;;
    ring();
  }
Default variables in an '''&lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt;''' can be overridden, for example

'''lib.scad'''

 i=1;
 k=3;
 module x() {
     echo(&quot;hello world&quot;);
     echo(&quot;i=&quot;,i,&quot;j=&quot;,j,&quot;k=&quot;,k);
 }

'''hello.scad'''
 j=4;
 include &lt;lib.scad&gt;;
 x();
 i=5;
 x();
 k=j;
 x();
 
Produces the following

 ECHO: &quot;hello world&quot;
 ECHO: &quot;i=&quot;, 5, &quot;j=&quot;, 4, &quot;k=&quot;, 4
 ECHO: &quot;hello world&quot;
 ECHO: &quot;i=&quot;, 5, &quot;j=&quot;, 4, &quot;k=&quot;, 4
 ECHO: &quot;hello world&quot;
 ECHO: &quot;i=&quot;, 5, &quot;j=&quot;, 4, &quot;k=&quot;, 4

However, placing '''&lt;code&gt;j=4;&lt;/code&gt;''' after the '''&lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt;''' fails, producing

 ECHO: &quot;hello world&quot;
 ECHO: &quot;i=&quot;, 5, &quot;j=&quot;, 4, &quot;k=&quot;, undef
 ECHO: &quot;hello world&quot;
 ECHO: &quot;i=&quot;, 5, &quot;j=&quot;, 4, &quot;k=&quot;, undef
 ECHO: &quot;hello world&quot;
 ECHO: &quot;i=&quot;, 5, &quot;j=&quot;, 4, &quot;k=&quot;, undef

See: [[w:Ceil_function|Ceil Function]]

 echo(ceil(4.4),ceil(-4.4));     // produces ECHO: 5, -4

=== cross ===

Calculates the cross product of two vectors in 3D space. The result is a vector that is perpendicular to both of the input vectors.

Using invalid input parameters (e.g. vectors with a length different from 3 or other types) will produce an undefined result.

'''Usage examples:'''
 echo(cross([2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7]));     // produces ECHO: [-3, 6, -3]
 echo(cross([2, 1, -3], [0, 4, 5]));    // produces ECHO: [17, -10, 8]
 echo(cross([2, 3, 4], &quot;5&quot;));           // produces ECHO: undef

=== exp ===
Mathematical '''exp''' function. Returns the base-e exponential function of x, which is the number e raised to the power x.  See: [[w:Exponent|Exponent]]

=== floor ===
Mathematical '''floor''' function.  floor(x) =  is the largest integer not greater than x 

See: [[w:Floor_function|Floor Function]]

 echo(floor(4.4),floor(-4.4));    // produces ECHO: 4, -5

=== ln ===
Mathematical '''natural logarithm'''.  See: [[w:Natural_logarithm|Natural logarithm]]

=== len ===
Mathematical '''length''' function.  Returns the length of an array, a vector or a string parameter.

'''Usage examples:'''
 str1=&quot;abcdef&quot;; len_str1=len(str1);
 echo(str1,len_str1);
 
 a=6; len_a=len(a);
 echo(a,len_a);
 
 array1=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]; len_array1=len(array1);
 echo(array1,len_array1);
 
 array2=[[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,1]]; len_array2=len(array2);
 echo(array2,len_array2);
 
 len_array2_2=len(array2[2]);
 echo(array2[2],len_array2_2);

'''Results:'''
 ECHO: &quot;abcdef&quot;, 6
 ECHO: 6, undef
 ECHO: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], 8
 ECHO: [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]], 4
 ECHO: [1, 0], 2



This function allows (e.g.) the parsing of an array, a vector or a string.

'''Usage examples:'''
 str2=&quot;4711&quot;;
 for (i=[0:len(str2)-1])
 	echo(str(&quot;digit &quot;,i+1,&quot;  :  &quot;,str2[i]));

 ECHO: &quot;digit 2  :  7&quot;
 ECHO: &quot;digit 3  :  1&quot;
 ECHO: &quot;digit 4  :  1&quot;

Note that the len() function is not defined when a simple variable is passed as the parameter. 

This is useful when handling parameters to a module, similar to how shapes can be defined as a single number, or as an [x,y,z] vector; i.e. cube(5) or cube([5,5,5])

For example

 module doIt(size) {
 	if (len(size) == undef) {
 		// size is a number, use it for x,y &amp; z. (or could be undef)
 		do([size,size,size]);
 	} else { 
 		// size is a vector, (could be a string but that would be stupid)
 		do(size);
 	}
  }
  
 doIt(5);	// equivalent to [5,5,5]
 doIt([5,5,5]);	// similar to cube(5) v's cube([5,5,5])

=== log ===
Mathematical '''logarithm'''. See: [[w:Logarithm|Logarithm]]

=== lookup ===

Look up value in table, and linearly interpolate if there's no exact match.  The first argument is the value to look up.  The second is the lookup table -- a vector of key-value pairs. 

'''Parameters'''
; key : A lookup key
; &amp;lt;key,value&amp;gt; array : keys and values
{| width=&quot;100%&quot;
'''Notes'''
&lt;br&gt; There is a bug where out-of-range keys will return the first value in the list.   Newer versions of Openscad should use the top or bottom end of the table as appropriate instead.
|'''Usage example:'''
* Will create a sort of 3D chart made out of cylinders of different height.
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
 function get_cylinder_h(p) = lookup(p, [
 		[ -200, 5 ],
 		[ -50, 20 ],
 		[ -20, 18 ],
 		[ +80, 25 ],
 		[ +150, 2 ]
 	]);
 
 for (i = [-100:5:+100]) {
 	// echo(i, get_cylinder_h(i));
 	translate([ i, 0, -30 ]) cylinder(r1 = 6, r2 = 2, h = get_cylinder_h(i)*3);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

 3.0
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Looking for 
'''mod'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - it's not a function, see [[OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Mathematical_Operators|modulo operator (%)]]
=== norm ===
:
Returns the [[w:Norm_(mathematics)|euclidean norm]] of a vector. Note this returns is the actual numeric length while '''len''' returns the number of elements in the vector or array.

'''Usage examples:'''
 a=[1,2,3,4];
 b=&quot;abcd&quot;;
 c=[];
 d=&quot;&quot;;
 e=[[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3],[1,2],[1]];
 echo(norm(a)); //5.47723
 echo(norm(b)); //undef
 echo(norm(c)); //0
 echo(norm(d)); //undef
 echo(norm(e[0])); //5.47723
 echo(norm(e[1])); //3.74166
 echo(norm(e[2])); //2.23607
 echo(norm(e[3])); //1

'''Results:'''
 ECHO: 5.47723
 ECHO: undef
 ECHO: 0
 ECHO: undef

=== pow ===
Mathematical '''power''' function.

'''Parameters'''

; &amp;lt;base&amp;gt; : Decimal.  Base. 
; &amp;lt;exponent&amp;gt; : Decimal.  Exponent. 

'''Usage examples:'''
 
 for (i = [0:5]) {
  translate([i*25,0,0]) {
    cylinder(h = pow(2,i)*5, r=10);
    echo (i, pow(2,i));
  }
 }

 echo(pow(10,2)); // means 10^2 or 10*10
 // result: ECHO: 100
 
 echo(pow(10,3)); // means 10^3 or 10*10*10
 // result: ECHO: 1000

=== rands ===
Random number generator.
Generates a constant vector of pseudo random numbers, much like an array. 
When generating only one number, you still call it with variable[0] 

'''Parameters'''
; min_value : Minimum value of random number range
; max_value : Maximum value of random number range
; value_count : Number of random numbers to return as a vector
; seed_value (optional) : Seed value for random number generator for repeatable results.

'''Usage Examples:'''

 // get a single number
 single_rand = rands(0,10,1)[0];
 echo(single_rand);

 // get a vector of 4 numbers
 seed=42;
 random_vect=rands(5,15,4,seed);
 echo( &quot;Random Vector: &quot;,random_vect);
 sphere(r=5);
 for(i=[0:3]) {
  rotate(360*i/4) {
    translate([10+random_vect[i],0,0])
      sphere(r=random_vect[i]/2);
  }
 }

=== round ===
The &quot;round&quot; operator returns the greatest or least integer part, respectively, if the numeric input is positive or negative.

Some examples:&lt;br /&gt;
 round(x.5) = x+1.&lt;br /&gt;
 round(x.49) = x.&lt;br /&gt;
 round(-(x.5)) = -(x+1).&lt;br /&gt;
 round(-(x.49)) = -x.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 round(5.4); //-&gt; 5&lt;br /&gt;
 round(5.5); //-&gt; 6&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a '''list of country names''' in Tagalog.  Many countries (''bansâ'', similar to ''bangsa'' in Malay and Indonesian) have corresponding names in Tagalog, which are mostly derived from Spanish and spelled according to Tagalog spelling conventions, and which are pronounced as they would normally be in Spanish.  Some countries meanwhile have native Tagalog equivalents, and others are borrowed from English, but spelled according to Tagalog conventions and whose pronunciation would be similar to their Spanish counterparts.   Still other countries meanwhile don't have names in Tagalog, and as such use their English names.

Tagalog country names are not encountered colloquially, where English names are commonly used.  However, they are used in formal documents, correspondence, speech and literature written in Tagalog.

=== Scalar Arithmetical Operators ===

The scalar arithmetical operators take numbers as operands and produce
a new number.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|&amp;#43;
|add
|-
|&amp;#45;
|subtract
|-
|*
|multiply
|-
|/
|divide
|-
|%
|modulo
|}

The &quot;-&quot; can also be used as prefix operator to negate a number.

=== Relational Operators ===

All relational operator take numbers as operands and produce
a Boolean value. The equal and not-equal operators can also compare
Boolean values.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|&lt;
|less than
|-
|&lt;=
|less equal
|-
|==
|equal
|-
|!=
|not equal
|-
|&gt;=
|greater equal
|-
|&gt;
|greater than
|}

=== Logical Operators ===

All logical operators take Boolean values as operands and produce
a Boolean value.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|&amp;&amp;
|Logical AND
|-
|&amp;#124;&amp;#124;
|Logical OR
|-
|!
|Logical NOT
|-
|}

===Conditional Operator===

The &lt;tt&gt;?:&lt;/tt&gt; operator can be used to conditionally evaluate one or another expression.
It works like the &lt;tt&gt;?:&lt;/tt&gt; operator from the family of C-like programming languages.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|&amp;nbsp;?&amp;nbsp;:
|Conditional operator
|}
{| width=&quot;75%&quot;
|'''Usage Example:'''
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
a=1;
b=2;
c= a==b ? 4 : 5;
&lt;/source&gt;
If a equals b, then c is set to 4, else c is set to 5.
&lt;br&gt;
The part &quot;a==b&quot; must be something that evaluates to a boolean value.
|}

=== Vector-Number Operators ===

The vector-number operators take a vector and a number as operands and produce a new vector.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|*
|multiply all vector elements by number
|-
|/
|divide all vector elements by number
|}

=== Vector Operators ===

The vector operators take vectors as operands and produce a new vector.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|&amp;#43;
|add element-wise
|-
|&amp;#45;
|subtract element-wise
|}

The &quot;-&quot; can also be used as prefix operator to element-wise negate a vector.

=== Vector Dot-Product Operator ===

The vector dot-product operator takes two vectors as operands and produces a scalar.
{| class = &quot;wikitable&quot;
|*
| sum of vector element products
|}

=== Matrix Multiplication ===

Multiplying a matrix by a vector, vector by matrix and matrix by matrix 
{| class = &quot;wikitable&quot;
|*
| matrix/vector multiplication
|}

=== Special variables ===

All variables starting with a '$' are special variables. The semantic is
similar to the special variables in lisp: they have dynamic instead of
lexical scoping. 

What that means is that they're effectively automatically passed onward as arguments. Comparing a normal with a special variable:
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
     normal=2;
     module doesnt_pass_it()
     {   echo(normal); }
     module normal_mod()
     {   doesnt_pass_it(); }
     normal_mod(normal=1); //Should echo 2
     
     $special=3; $another=5;
     module passes_it()
     {   echo($special, $another); }
     module special_mod()
     {   $another=6;
         passes_it(); 
     }
     special_mod($special=4); //Should echo 4,6
&lt;/source&gt;
So basically it is useful when you do not want to pass many parameters all the time.

====$fa, $fs and $fn====

The $fa, $fs and $fn special variables control the number of facets used to
generate an arc:

$fa is the minimum angle for a fragment. Even a huge circle does not have
more fragments than 360 divided by this number. The default value is 12 (i.e. 30 fragments
for a full circle). The minimum allowed value is 0.01. Any attempt to set a lower value will cause a warning.

$fs is the minimum size of a fragment. Because of this variable very small
circles have a smaller number of fragments than specified using $fa. The
default value is 2. The minimum allowed value is 0.01. Any attempt to set a lower value will cause a warning.

$fn is usually 0. When this variable has a value greater than zero, the
other two variables are ignored and full circle is rendered using this
number of fragments. The default value is 0.

When $fa and $fs are used to determine the number of fragments for a
circle, then OpenSCAD will never use less than 5 fragments.

This is the C code that calculates the number of fragments in a circle:

       int get_fragments_from_r(double r, double fn, double fs, double fa)
       {
              if (r &lt; GRID_FINE) return 3;
              if (fn &gt; 0.0) return (int)(fn &gt;= 3 ? fn : 3);
              return (int)ceil(fmax(fmin(360.0 / fa, r*2*M_PI / fs), 5));
       }

Spheres are first sliced into as many slices as the number of fragments being used
to render a circle of the sphere's radius, and then every slice is rendered
into as many fragments as are needed for the slice radius. You might have
recognized already that the pole of a sphere is usually a pentagon. This is
why.

The number of fragments for a cylinder is determined using the greater of
the two radii.

The method is also used when rendering circles and arcs from DXF files.

You can generate high resolution spheres by resetting the $fX values in
the instantiating module:

       $fs = 0.01;
       sphere(2);

or simply by passing the special variable as parameter:

       sphere(2, $fs = 0.01);

You can even scale the special variable instead of resetting it:

       sphere(2, $fs = $fs * 0.01);

====$t====

The $t variable is used for animation. If you enable the animation frame with view-&gt;animate and give a value for &quot;FPS&quot; and &quot;Steps&quot;, the &quot;Time&quot; field shows the current value of $t. With this information in mind, you can animate your design. The design is recompiled every 1/&quot;FPS&quot; seconds with $t incremented by 1/&quot;Steps&quot; for &quot;Steps&quot; times, ending at either $t=1 or $t=1-1/steps.  

If &quot;Dump Pictures&quot; is checked, then images will be created in the same directory as the .scad file, using the following $t values, and saved in the following files:
* $t=0/Steps filename=&quot;frame00001.png&quot;
* $t=1/Steps filename=&quot;frame00002.png
* $t=2/Steps filename=&quot;frame00003.png&quot;
* . . .
* $t=1-3/Steps filename=&quot;frame&lt;Steps-2&gt;.png&quot;
* $t=1-2/Steps filename=&quot;frame&lt;Steps-1&gt;.png&quot;
* $t=1-1/Steps filename=&quot;frame00000.png&quot;

Or, for other values of Steps, it follows this pattern:

* $t=0/Steps filename=&quot;frame00001.png&quot;
* $t=1/Steps filename=&quot;frame00002.png
* $t=2/Steps filename=&quot;frame00003.png&quot;
* . . .
* $t=1-3/Steps filename=&quot;frame&lt;Steps-2&gt;.png&quot;
* $t=1-2/Steps filename=&quot;frame&lt;Steps-1&gt;.png&quot;
* $t=1-1/Steps filename=&quot;frame&lt;Steps-0&gt;.png&quot;
* $t=1-0/Steps filename=&quot;frame00000.png&quot;

Which pattern it chooses appears to be an unpredictable, but consistent, function of Steps.  For example, when Steps=4, it follows the first pattern, and outputs a total of 4 files.  When Steps=3, it follows the second pattern, and also outputs 4 files.  It will always output either Steps or Steps+1 files, though it may not be predictable which.  When finished, it will wrap around and recreate each of the files, looping through and recreating them forever.

====$vpr and $vpt====
These contain the current viewport rotation and translation - at the time of doing the rendering. Moving he viewport does not update them. During an animation they are updated for each frame.
*$vpr shows rotation
*$vpt shows translation (i.e. won't be affected by rotate and zoom)
It's not possible to write to them and thus change the viewport parameters (although that could be a decent enough idea). 

Example
  cube([10,10,$vpr[0]/10]);
which makes the cube change size based on the view angle, if an animation loop is active (which does not need to use the $t variable)

You can also make bits of a complex model vanish as you change the view.

The menu command ''Edit - Paste Viewport Rotation/Translation'' copies the current value of the viewport, but not the current $vpr or $vpt.

=== Echo Statements ===

This function prints the contents to the compilation window (aka Console).  Useful for debugging code. Also see the String function [[OpenSCAD_User_Manual/String_Functions#str|str()]].

Numeric values are rounded to 5 significant digits.

The OpenSCAD console supports a subset of HTML markup language. See [http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.7/richtext-html-subset.html here] for details.

'''Usage examples:'''

 my_h=50;
 my_r=100;
 echo(&quot;This is a cylinder with h=&quot;, my_h, &quot; and r=&quot;, my_r);
 cylinder(h=my_h, r=my_r);
 //
 echo(&lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;&lt;b&gt;Hello&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Qt!&lt;/i&gt;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;);

Shows in the Console as
 ECHO: &quot;This is a cylinder with h=&quot;, 50, &quot; and r=&quot;, 100
 ECHO: &quot;&lt;b&gt;Hello&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Qt!&lt;/i&gt;&quot;

=== Render ===

Forces the generation of a mesh even in preview mode. Useful when the boolean operations become too slow to track.

Needs description.

'''Usage examples:'''

 render(convexity = 2) difference() {
  cube([20, 20, 150], center = true);
  translate([-10, -10, 0])
   cylinder(h = 80, r = 10, center = true);
  translate([-10, -10, +40])
   sphere(r = 10);
  translate([-10, -10, -40])
   sphere(r = 10);
 }

=== Offset ===

{{requires|2014.QX|[https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues?milestone{{=}}3]}}

Offset allows moving polygon outlines outward or inward by a given amount.

'''Parameters'''

; delta : Double. Amount to offset the polygon. When negative, the polygon is offset inwards.

; join_type : String. Defines how the lines are joined. Possible values are &quot;bevel&quot;, &quot;round&quot; and &quot;miter&quot;. Defaults to &quot;miter&quot;.

{{multiple image
 | align = center
 | width = 350
 | footer = Result for different values of the join_type parameter. The black polygon is the input for the offset() operation.
 | image1 = OpenSCAD offset join-type out.svg
 | caption1 = Positive delta value
 | image2 = OpenSCAD offset join-type in.svg
 | caption2 = Negative delta value
 }}

: Note the effect of the miter_limit in the join_type = &quot;miter&quot;, positive delta example. The left top corner is beveled because a straight connection is longer than the limit given as miter_limit.

; miter_limit : Double. This is only valid with join_type = &quot;miter&quot;. Defines the limit where lines at a small angle are not joined with a sharp long edge anymore reverting to bevel style join.

'''Examples'''

[[File:OpenSCAD offset example.png|thumb|Example 1: Result.]]
 // Example 1
 
 linear_extrude(height = 60, twist = 90, slices = 60) {
   difference() {
     offset(delta = 10, join_type = &quot;round&quot;) {
       square(20, center = true);
     }
     offset(delta = 8, join_type = &quot;round&quot;) {
       square(20, center = true);
     }
   }
 }
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

=== Surface ===

Surface reads [[:w:Heightmap|Heightmap]] information from text or image files.

'''Parameters'''

; file : String. The path to the file containing the heightmap data.

; center : Boolean.  This determines the positioning of the generated object.  If true, object is centered in X- and Y-axis.  Otherwise, the object is placed in the positive quadrant.  Defaults to false.

; invert : Boolean. Inverts how the color values of imported images are translated into height values. This has no effect when importing text data files. Defaults to false. {{requires|2014.QX|[https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues?milestone{{=}}3]}}

; convexity : Integer. The convexity parameter specifies the maximum number of front sides (back sides) a ray intersecting the object might penetrate. This parameter is only needed for correctly displaying the object in OpenCSG preview mode and has no effect on the final rendering.

==== Text file format ====

The format for text based heightmaps is a matrix of numbers that represent the height for a specific point. Rows are mapped to the Y-axis, columns to the X axis.
The numbers must be separated by spaces or tabs. Empty lines and lines starting with a # character are ignored.

==== Images ====

{{requires|2014.QX|[https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues?milestone{{=}}3]}}

Currently only PNG images are supported. Alpha channel information of the image is ignored and the height for the pixel is determined by converting the color value to [[:w:Grayscale|Grayscale]] using the linear luminance for the sRGB color space (Y = 0.2126R + 0.7152G + 0.0722B). The gray scale values are scaled to be in the range 0 to 100.

==== Examples ====

'''Example 1:'''
 //surface.scad
 surface(file = &quot;surface.dat&quot;, center = true, convexity = 5);
 %translate([0,0,5])cube([10,10,10], center =true);

 #surface.dat
 10 9 8 7 6 5 5 5 5 5 
 9 8 7 6 6 4 3 2 1 0 
 8 7 6 6 4 3 2 1 0 0
 7 6 6 4 3 2 1 0 0 0
 6 6 4 3 2 1 1 0 0 0
 6 6 3 2 1 1 1 0 0 0
 6 6 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0
 6 6 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Result:

[[File:Openscad_surface_example_x1.png]]

'''Example 2'''

  // example010.dat generated using octave:
  // d = (sin(1:0.2:10)' * cos(1:0.2:10)) * 10;
  // save(&quot;example010.dat&quot;, &quot;d&quot;);
  intersection() {
    surface(file = &quot;example010.dat&quot;, center = true, convexity = 5);
    rotate(45, [0, 0, 1]) surface(file = &quot;example010.dat&quot;, center = true, convexity = 5); 
  }

'''Example 3:'''

{{requires|2014.QX|[https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues?milestone{{=}}3]}}

 // Example 3a
 scale([1, 1, 0.1])
   surface(file = &quot;smiley.png&quot;, center = true);

 // Example 3b
 scale([1, 1, 0.1])
   surface(file = &quot;smiley.png&quot;, center = true, invert = true);

=== Search ===

The search() function is a general-purpose function to find one or more (or all) occurrences of a value or list of values in a vector, string or more complex list-of-list construct.

==== Search Usage ====

:search( ''match_value'' , ''string_or_vector'' [, ''num_returns_per_match'' [, ''index_col_num'' ] ] );

==== Search Arguments ====

* '''match_value'''
:* Can be a single value or vector of values.
:* Strings are treated as vectors-of-characters to iterate over; the search function does '''not''' search for substrings.
:* '''Note:''' If ''match_value'' is a vector of strings, search will look for exact string matches.
::* See '''Example 9''' below.

* '''string_or_vector'''
:* The string or vector to search for matches.

* '''num_returns_per_match''' (default: 1)
:* By default, search only looks for one match per element of match_value to return as a list of indices
:* If num_returns_per_match &gt; 1, search returns a list of lists of up to num_returns_per_match index values for each element of match_value.
::* See '''Example 8''' below.
:* If num_returns_per_match = 0, search returns a list of lists of '''all''' matching index values for each element of match_value.

=== OpenSCAD Version ===

version() and version_num() will return OpenSCAD version number.
* The version() function will return the OpenSCAD version as a vector, e.g. [2011, 09, 23]
* The version_num() function will return the OpenSCAD version as a number, e.g. 20110923

=== parent_module(n) and $parent_modules ===

$parent_module contains the number of modules in the instantiation stack.
parent_module(i) returns the name of the module i levels about the current module in the instantiation stack.
The stack is independent on where the modules are defined. It's where they're instantiated that counts.
This can be used to e.g. build BOMs.

Example:

  module top() {
    children();
  }
  module middle() {
    children();
  }
  top() middle() echo(parent_module(0)); // prints &quot;middle&quot;
  top() middle() echo(parent_module(1)); // prints &quot;top&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Encoders ==

'''Encoders''' are devices that act on data to transform it in such a way that the data acquires some new characteristics. These characteristics can vary from reduction in length to inclusion of error correction properties to use of security measures. At the most basic level, encoders can be used to reduce the size of data. Consider the following block diagram : 

       ____
 A ---|    |
 B ---|    |-- X
 C ---|    |-- Y
      |____|


If out of ABCD only one is high at any given time, then we can only have the following possibilities for input : 000, 001, 010, 100. Thus we can make the internal circuit of the encoder in such a way that when it sees 000 it outputs 00, when it sees 001 it outputs 01, when it sees 010 it gives 10 and when it sees 100 it outputs 11


     __________
 ---| 000 | 00 |
 ---|-----|----|
 ---| 001 | 01 |
 ---|-----|----|
 ---| 010 | 10 |
 ---|-----|----|
 ---| 100 | 11 |
 ---|_____|____|



Thus we have effectively reduced the size of the data, by exploiting the fact that all possible combinations of input will never be provided at the input terminals.

The internal circuit of the encoder can be easily derived by using truth tables


     _____________________
 ---| A | B | C ||| X | Y |
 ---| 0 | 0 | 0 ||| 0 | 0 |
 ---| 0 | 0 | 1 ||| 0 | 1 |
 ---| 0 | 1 | 0 ||| 1 | 0 | 
 ---| 1 | 0 | 0 ||| 1 | 1 |
 ---|___|___|___|||___|___|


Clearly X  = A + B and Y = A + C

So the circuit diagram can be : 

 A ----------[ OR ]----------X
     |   B---[ OR ]
     |
     |-------[ OR ]----------Y
         C---[ OR ]
 

This scheme can be extended for n inputs.

This was a very basic encoder, it could act only on data when a single line was high. It is possible that multiple lines may be high, in that case one may use priority encoders which assign output based on priority, that is if two lines are high, for example A and C in the previous example, then a priority encoder will, based on a prior decision by the designer, decide to assign output to either C or A thereby assigning it a higher priority.

In some cases we don't want priority encoding, rather when faced with multiple signals, we wish to create a new code for that particular combination as well, and still obtain some reduction in size.

At other times we may wish to modify the incoming code in a manner that allows the receiver to detect any errors that may have crept in during transmission. These topics will be elaborated upon in appropriate topics.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The history of AI has had some embarrassingly optimistic predictions, particularly in the early years. In short, AI researchers severely underestimated the difficulty of some of the problems. Though there was success with designing programs that could play chess, it turned out that recognizing the chess pieces in video was much more difficult.

Futurist Ray Kurzweil continues to publish optimistic predictions. He has popularized the term &quot;singularity&quot; as it applies to AI (though the term was coined by Vernor Vinge for this purpose.) The singularity is the point in time when Artificial Intelligence can automatically improve on itself faster than humans where previously able to. The reason it's called the singularity is because it is very difficult to know what will happen afterward, since the future will then depend on the decisions of beings more intelligent than we are.

Kurzweil's predictions are based on a number of observations about the exponential growth in certain fields, such as nanotechnology, computational power, genetic analysis, and accuracy of brain scanning. Very basically, his argument is as follows: Brain scanning technology is getting better at an exponential rate. Therefore, soon we will be able to scan entire brains at the level of detail necessary to understand everything, physically, we need to know to create a simulation of a brain in software. The exponential growth of computational power will allow future computers to be able to process all of this data. Having a brain in software will allow us to rapidly test and understand how intelligence works in human beings (as well as other animals.) It will then be a short time before we can improve on it.

Kurzweil predicts that the singularity will occur at approximately 2041.

      <comment>/* Hinged DNA */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">DNA does not always take the form of a double helix. It can often be found creating structures considered abnormal when compared to what is commonly considered DNA. Normally, DNA contains a B-form helix. Improper formation of base pairs can greatly affect DNA's structure and flexibility.

Single-stranded nucleic acids can form hairpins. Such formations can affect the transcription terminations in prokaryotes. With regard to double-stranded DNA, they can form something called cruciforms.

== Hairpins ==
Hairpin loops are formed by a fold in a single strand of DNA, causing several bases to remain unpaired before the strand loops back upon itself. A hairpin loop is only possible if the strand of DNA contains the complimentary bases in correct sequence to those that appear earlier in the strand. For example; if a DNA strand contained CCGT followed by several bases including ACGG, the strand is capable of creating a hairpin loop by folding back on itself.

Hairpin loops can occur in both DNA and RNA, though in RNA the thymine base is replaced by uracil. The number of bases in the loop itself is variable, though it never exists in the length of three bases, as the steric hindrance makes the configuration too unstable.

Here is an image example of hairpin DNA: 
(Image is of a Long-alpha hairpin)
[[File:PDB_2qoz_EBI.png]]

== Cruciforms ==
Cruciform DNA structure appears as several hairpin loops, creating a crucifix-like structure composed of DNA.

DNA structure is formed by incomplete exchange of the strands between the double-stranded helices.

Cruciform DNA 
Eukaryotic cells contain DNA-binding protein that can specifically recognize cruciform DNA. Interactions with ubiquitous protein plays a crucial role for the conformation of cruciform DNA.

An example of a DNA-binding Protein is Crp1p. This DNA-binding protein is found in the yeast ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae''

Image of the formation of Cruciform DNA can be found 
[http://www.utoronto.ca/medicalgenetics/Documents/publications/Cote%20and%20Lewis%20-%20Focus%20on%20Research.jpg here].

== Triple Helix ==
The triple helix form of DNA is similar to the double helix DNA except that it contains another oligonucleotide that hydrogen bonds to the bases that are already included in the double helix strands of DNA. 

'''Background'''&lt;br /&gt;
The triple-stranded DNA was a very common hypothesis in the 1950s when scientists were having trouble figuring out the true structure of DNA. Watson and Crick, Pauling and Corey all published a triple-helix model proposal. Watson and Crick found problems with the model. The problems were as follows:

# Negatively charged phosphates near the axis will repel each other, leaving the question as to how the three-chain structure would stay together. &lt;br /&gt;
# In a triple-helix model (specifically Pauling and Corey's model), some of the van der Waals distances appear to be too small.[http://www.zampwiki.com/?t=Triple-stranded_DNA 1]

For more information on Triple-stranded DNA see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-stranded DNA Triple-stranded DNA]


An image of the triple helix form can be found [http://employees.csbsju.edu/hjakubowski/classes/ch331/bind/triplehelixnew.gif here].

== Hinged DNA ==
Hinged DNA (H-DNA) is a triple helix structure that exists based on hydrogen bonds between DNA bases. The three strands base pair by Hoogsteen base pairing. Hoogsteeen base pairing is a variation of base-pairing in the nucleic acids such as the A-T pair or the G-C pair. The Hoogsteen base pair applies the &quot;N7 position of purine base and c6 amino group which bind the Waston-Crick fafce of pyrimidine base.&quot; More information on the Hoogsteen base pair can be found [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoogsteen_base_pair here.] It is also called H-DNA because of its dependence on hydrogen bonds. The H-DNA can be found in vitro or during recombination and also in DNA repair. 

An example of H-DNA can be found [http://ase.tufts.edu/biology/labs/mirkin/images/Fig3.jpg here].

== G-Quadruplex ==
G-quadruplexes are a family of quadruple-stranded structures formed by a guanine-rich sequences of nucleic acids. Members of this family share a common square arrangement of four guanines centered around a monovalent cation and stabilized by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding. The guanines may adopt either an anti or syn alignment about the glycosidic bond. The backbone strands of the g-tetrad can also adopt a variety of directionalities: all four strands may be oriented in the same direction, three strands are oriented in one direction while the fourth is in another direction, two adjacent strands can be oriented in one direction while the other two will be oriented in another direction, or each strand will have adjacent anti parallel neighbors. The sequence of amino acid that has the potential to form g-quadruplex is: GxNaGxNbGxNcGx, where x is the number of G residues and Na, Nb, and Nc are loops of different lengths. Furthermore, they can form in DNA, RNA, LNA, and PNA, and either be intramolecular, bimolecular and tetramolecular compounds. Their four stranded motifs create four grooves each with varying widths and depths. Their folding depends on many factors; DNA sequence, presence of ions, temperatures, and presence of various ligands. They are a special area of interest due to their biological implications specifically in telomeres and as contributors to gene regulation.


A shows a G-tetrad, B shows the Anti and Syn conformations of Guanine, C shows the various directionailities of the backbone strands, D shows the different types of loops 


Structure determination of G-quadruplex based on crystallography or solution NMR demonstrates significant deviations in conformation and loop geometry suggesting heterogeneity in strand topology and loop conformation of G-quadruplexes. Varying conformations can result in varying stability. Furthermore, studies of the various conformations reveal that the nature of the loop sequence and the formation of interactions between loops and the quadruplex core are important elements in controlling quadruplex topology and stability. For example, in examining the bindinging of quinacridine-based ligand to a G-quadruplex, interactions with the sides of the G-stack do not alter the topology but interaction with the loop sequence ended up altering the conformation of the loops. This hints at the notion that the loop sequences of the quadruplex are what actually moderate the binding affinity and specificity of the whole structure. 

The four-stranded structure with four grooves instead of the normal two found in typical DNA structure, provides a variety of surfaces for interactions with ligands. Aromatic compounds of various dimensions showed favorable interactions with the planer surfaces of terminal guanine tetrads. Intercalation between layers of G-tetrads does not occur, however because G-tetrads do not allow for bulky aromatic compounds to insert itself between layers of guanine. 

In eukaryotic telomeres, there exists repeats of g-rich sequences that can fold into g tetrads. It has been postulated that this structure plays an important role in cell aging and human diseases such as cancer, then making them targets to anticancer drugs.

== Overview ==

This page provides basic code for creating a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_matrix  distance matrix] and running and plotting a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling  Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling] (NMDS) ordination. 

Read more about [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination_(statistics)  Ordination] on Wikipedia.

This code relies on package vegan in R by [http://cc.oulu.fi/~jarioksa/  Jari Oksanen].

== Data ==

First, import data and load required libraries:
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
require(MASS)
require(vegan)
data(varespec)   # species data
data(varechem)   # environmental data
&lt;/source&gt;

== Distance matrix ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
bray &lt;- vegdist(varespec, method = &quot;bray&quot;)				# calculate a distance matrix

# There are many distance measure options for 'dist', 
# discoverable by running '?dist'. Common distance measures include:
       # 'bray' = Bray-Curtis
       # 'canb' = Canberra
       # 'euclidean' = Euclidean
&lt;/source&gt;

= Unconstrained Ordination =
== Displaying dissimilarity using NMDS ==

NMDS analysis and plotting: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
nmds &lt;- metaMDS(varespec, k = 2, 
          distance = 'bray', autotransform = FALSE) 	# semi-black box NMDS function

ordiplot(nmds, type = &quot;text&quot;)			      # Plot NMDS ordination
fit &lt;- envfit(nmds, varechem[ ,1:4])			   # Calculates environmental vectors
fit						        # Lists vector endpoint coordinates and r-squared values
plot(fit)						   # adds environmental vectors
# a linear representation of environmental variables is not always appropiate
# we could also add a smooth surface of the variable to the plot
ordisurf(nmds, varechem$N, add = TRUE, col = &quot;darkgreen&quot;)
nmds$stress                                             # stress value 
&lt;/source&gt;

[[File:Nmds.pdf|thumb|resulting nmds plot]]


In the metaMDS function, k is user-defined and relates to how easily the projection fits the dataframe when contrained to k dimensions. Conventional wisdom seems to suggest that stress should not exceed 10-12%. Stress is reduced by increasing the number of dimensions. However, increasing dimensionality might decrease the &quot;realism&quot; of a 2-dimensional plot of the first two NMDS axes.


We can also run a nMDS with 3 dimensions, fit environmental vectors and create a dynamic graph:
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
nmds3d &lt;- metaMDS(varespec, k = 3, 
  distance = 'bray', autotransform = FALSE)              # run nmds with 3 dimensions
nmds3d$stress                                            # stress drops
fit3d &lt;- envfit(nmds3d, varechem[ ,1:4], choices = 1:3)  # fit environmental vectors to 3d space
ordirgl(nmds3d, envfit = fit3d)                          # dynamic 3D graph
&lt;/source&gt;

== Running a principle component analysis (PCA) on environmental data ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
chem_pca &lt;- rda(varechem, scale = TRUE)    # Run PCA
biplot(chem_pca, scaling = 2)              # display biplot
&lt;/source&gt;

If this were an actual book I would see the merit in the inclusion of this precalc review.  But since this is on wikibooks, I don't see such clear reasoning to include this review, since the material should be here but in another book.[[User:Tiled|Tiled]] ([[User talk:Tiled|talk]]) 21:27, 17 November 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Vocabulary==
==Lesson==
===Picture as Background===
#Have the picture you want to use as a background saved in a folder where you know where it is. 
#Go to the Design Tab
#Go to the Background Group
#Click on Background Styles drop down menu
#Click on Format Background
#Click the radio button for Picture or texture fill
#Click on the FILE button and browse to the picture
#*Click on CLOSE to apply the picture to just the current slide
#*Click on APPLY TO ALL to apply the picture to all slides in the presentation
[[File:format_background.jpg]]

===Creating graphics with transparent backgrounds===
#Click on the INSERT Tab
#Click on either Picture or Clip Art
#Find the picture you want and bring it into the slide
#Click on the PICTURE TOOLS button at the top of the window
#Click the RECOLOR button in the ADJUST group
#Click on the Set Transparent color button at the bottom of the dialog box
#Click on the one color you want to be transparent
NOTE: if you want more than one color transparent you will need to do this in a photo editor and save the picture as a PNG, GIF, or TIFF

[[File:Tranparent_Picture.jpg]]

===Transitions===
Transitions are the motion of how to get to the current slide.  
#Go to the Animation tab
#Go to the TRANSITION TO THIS SLIDE group
#Choose a transition for how this slide will enter
#*if you want the presentation to run automatically then on the far right change the Advance Slide to Automatically and set the amount of time. 
#*If you want to have to click to get the slides to advance click the ON MOUSE CLICK check box
#You can also set the speed of the transition
#You can also add sounds for the transition

===Animations===
One of the more fun things you can do in PowerPoint is to make things move. One thing to keep in mind is for formal presentations, don't overdo the animations.  Let your audience focus on your content and not be distracted with all the motion.  If the motion adds to the meaning or content, then it belongs.  

&lt;p&gt; Under the Animation Tab you have several choices for how you will add animation to your show.  
*Text can be animated with these custom entrances to add flair:
**Whip
**Swish
**Flip
**Unfold
**Grow &amp; Turn
**Color Typewriter
**many others
*Pictures can be animated simply
**Fade
**Wipe
**Fly In
*Slide Transitions
**Fades
**Cuts
**Dissolves
**Wipes
**Uncovers
**Wheels
**Many variations of each

===Custom Animations===
Pictures can be animated more dramatically with Custom Animations.  To get there go to the: 
&lt;p&gt;Animations Tab - Animations Group - Custom Animation Button
&lt;p&gt;There are four main groups of animations: 
*Entrance
**Appear
**some other affect to enter onto the screen
*Emphasis
**spin either direction and any set number of degrees
**Many other motions
*Exit
**Disappear
**Many other ways to remove off the screen
*Motion Paths
**Draw Custom Path - Scribble
**Many other ways to move on the screen

&lt;p&gt;The best thing to do is take a graphic and try some of the animations out.

&lt;p&gt;Once you have several affects added to your picture or text you might want some of them to occur at the same time.  In the drop down under the Custom Animations you can set them to: 
*on Click
*with Previous
*after Previous
With these settings and the speed settings you can get many dramatic affects.

&lt;p&gt;Try to take a picture of a skier and have them fall down a hill by adding a spin and a motion path that occur with previous.

===Sounds===
Sounds are another way to add a special touch to a presentation. But here to you can go overboard.  Only add sounds that really need to be there for the effect you want.  

&lt;p&gt;To get to sounds go to: 
&lt;p&gt;Insert Tab - Media Clips Group - Sounds icon
&lt;p&gt;You can add sounds from the following sources: 
*Sounds from file
*Sound from the clip organizer
*Play CD Audio Track
*Record sound
&lt;p&gt;If you have a folder of Royalty Free sounds you can add any of them to your PowerPoint by browsing to it. If you use the clip organizer it is just like adding a clip art. If you play with the CD then you need to make sure the CD is in the CD player anytime you want to view the presentation. If you want to create something like a kids book where the book reads along with the kid, you can record your own sounds.  You must have a microphone hooked up for this option to work.  

&lt;p&gt; Once you have the sounds in the presentation they will appear in the Custom Animation list and you can set when in the presentation you want them to play.  You can set them to play automatically or after you click or after some other action.  You can also set it to repeat the sound, and to hide the sound icon during the presentation.

===Rehearsal Timing===
A finishing touch to a presentation is to have practiced your presentation and have the slide change automatically for you when you are ready for them.  This can be done easily with the rehearsal timings.  To get to this go to the: 
*Slide Show Tab - Set up Group - Rehearse Timings button
*Give your presentation as you would normally
*Press space bar as you need
*Re-play the slide show and it will keep the timings you just set.

==Project==
Create a mini movie on a school apropriate topic of your choosing.  
&lt;p&gt;Examples: 
*snowmobile safety
*chemistry lab safety
*Newtons laws of motion
*World War II
*Frogs in their natural habitat
*A video game prototype
Requirements:
#Custom animations on every page
#Slide transitions between every slide
#One slide needs to have a picture for a background
#Individual creativity
#Creating graphics with transparent backgrounds
#A Sound must be added to at least one slide for emphasis
Helpful hits to make this extrodinary:
*Use a tool such as Photoshop or Gimp to edit your graphics
*Use layers with some layers semi-transperant to make it look like you are behind glass or under water
*Use layers so you can go behind different items
*Bring in a CD to add music in the background
*Work with the custom animations and have several of them &quot;start with previous&quot;.  This works really well with a motion path and an emphasis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Proteins with new functions can be created through directed changes in DNA. In the classic genetic approach, mutations are generated randomly throughout the genome. Analysis of mutatants reveal which genes are altered and DNA sequencing identifies the exact changes. Now, utilizing recombinant DNA technology, specific mutations can be made in vitro. New genes can be constructed by three changes to the sequence: deletions, insertions, and substitutions.

==Deletions==
Deletions occur when one or multiple base pairs are cleaved from a DNA sequence. A specific deletion can be produced by cleaving a plasmid at two sites with a restriction enzyme which removes a large segment of DNA. A smaller deletion can be made by cutting a plasmid at a one site and the linear DNA can be digested by an exonuclease that removes nucleotides from both strands. T

Deletion is when a base pair is removed from the DNA sequence.  This causes the DNA strand to be shorter.

==Substitutions==
Single amino acid substitutions can be produced by oligonuleotide-directed mutagenesis. This mutation can be made if (1) a plasmid containing the gene or cDNA for the protein is obtained and (2) the base sequence around to site to be altered is known. If serine is to be changed to cystine, the code TCT needs to be changed to TGT, a point mutation. The key to this mutation is to prepare an oligonucleotide primer that is complementary to this region except that it contains TGT instead of TCT. The mismatch of one base pair out of 15 does not make a large difference. Replication of these DNA strands with the mutated primers leads to two kinds of plasmids, one with the original sequence and one with the mutated sequence.

A substitution occurs when one base pair is replaced with another.  There are three main effects of substitutions in DNA:  

1. The substituted base could encode a stop codon.  This will stop the DNA from producing the rest of the amino acids and could lead to a nonfunctioning protein that might be harmful to the biological system or damaging to the DNA. 

2. The new substituted base could encode a different amino-acid, which will make the DNA produce a different amino-acid than it was supposed to.

3. Silent Mutation- This is when the changed base still codes for the same amino acid.  These mutations are rarely harmful to the DNA or biological system.

==Insertions==
Insertions of a DNA sequence can be made using cassette mutagenesis. In this technique, plasmid DNA is cut with a pair of restriction enzymes to remove a short segment which can be replaced by a synthetic double stranded oligonucleotide.

{{BookCat}}

Insertions are the result of extra bases added into the DNA sequence.

==Frame Shifts==
This is caused by insertions and deletions.  Deletions will make the DNA sequence shorter, while insertions will extend the DNA sequence’s length.  Codons are encoded in groups of 3 bases.  A deletion or insertion of bases will shift the whole sequence, and the DNA could potentially encode a whole new set of amino-acids.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Fatty Wax''' ==

A wax is a simple lipid that is an ester of a long-chain alcohol and a fatty acid. The alcohol may be made up of 12-32 carbon atoms. 

These waxes can be found in nature as coatings on leaves and stems of plants, and prevents the plant from losing excessive amounts of water. Carnuba wax is found on the leaves of Brazilian palm trees and is used in floor and automobile waxes. Lanolin coats lamb's wool. Beeswax is secreted by bees to make cells for honey and eggs. Spermaceti wax is found in the head cavities and blubber of the sperm whale. 
Many of these waxes are used in ointments, hand creams, and cosmetics, which can be seen in the ingredients lists.

Paraffin wax which is used in some candles, is not based upon the ester functional group, but instead is a mixture of high molecular weight alkanes. Ear wax, on the other hand, is a mixture of phospholipids and esters of cholesterol.

The waxes with their component alcohols and fatty acids are listed below:

&lt;u&gt;Carnuba&lt;/u&gt;:

Alcohol- CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-OH, Fatty Acid- CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;COOH

&lt;u&gt;Beeswax&lt;/u&gt;:

Alcohol- CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-OH, Fatty Acid- CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;COOH

&lt;u&gt;Spermacetic&lt;/u&gt;:

Alcohol- CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-OH, Fatty Acid- CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;COOH 


----

&lt;big&gt;'''Ester Synthesis:'''&lt;/big&gt;

Simple esters contain an organic acid and an alcohol. The ester functional group is of significance in the biochemical group of compounds called waxes, triglycerides, and phospholipids.
The simplified reaction reveals the process of breaking some bonds and forming the ester and the by product, water. It is as follows:
First, the -OH bond of the acid is broken as well as the -H bond of the alcohol. Both join to make HOH, a water molecule.
Secondly, the oxygen of the alcohol forms a bond to the acid at the carbon with the double bond oxygen. This forms the ester functional group.
Note that the long carbon chains do not participate in the reaction, but are just part of the final molecule.


----

&lt;big&gt;'''Lipstick:'''&lt;/big&gt;

Lipstick is a common form of fatty wax. It consists of a suspension of coloring agents in high molecular weight hydrocarbons, waxes, and/or fats. The color usually comes from a dye precipitated by a metal ion such as Fe (III), Ni(II), or Co(II) ions. An ingredients list on the lipstick might contain: dye (4-8%); castor oil, paraffin, or fats to dissolve dye (50%); lanolin (25%); carnauba and/or beeswax as a stiffening agent (36%); perfume (1.5%). The lipstick is made by first dispersing the dye in the castor oil. Then, the other waxes and lanolin are added as the mixture is heated and stirred. The molten waxes are then cast in a suitable form to harden.


&lt;big&gt;'''Eye Makeup:'''&lt;/big&gt;

Eye makeup is also another form of fatty wax. Eyebrow pencils are similar to lipstick but contain lamp black (carbon soot) as a black coloring agent. A different mixture of waxes may be used to give the desired melting point. Brown pencils are made by adding iron oxide (rust) as a pigment.
A water-resistant mascara has a mixture of waxes, fats, oils, and soap. Other coloring agents in addition to blacks and browns may be chromic oxide (dark green) and ultramarine (blue pigment of sodium and aluminum silicate).

      <comment>/* Soap */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Soap ==



Soap is a form of lipid which is a mixture of sodium salts of various naturally occurring fatty acids. When air bubbles are added to a molten soap, the density of the soap decreases thus making it float on water. A softer soap lather results when the fatty acid salt contains potassium rather than sodium. Soap is the product of a saponification or basic hydrolysis reaction of a fat or oil. Sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide is currently used to neutralize the fatty acid and convert it to the salt.

The basic hydrolysis reaction is as follows:
:Fat + NaOH → sodium salt of fatty acid + glycerol

This reaction occurs in two steps and the net effect is the broken ester bonds. The glycerol first turns back into an alcohol, then the fatty acid portion is turned into a salt due to the presence of the basic NaOH solution. The oxygen of the carboxyl group now has a negative charge which attracts the positive sodium ion.

==Structure==
Micelles are formed when a certain molecule are added with water. The molecule is fatty acids, phospholipids, or a salt of a fatty acid (soap). The molecule has a strong polar head and non-polar hydrocarbon tail. When this molecule is added to water, the non-polar tails associate each other in the center like a ball because their hydrophobic tails or “water hating” are not soluble in water. The polar heads of the molecule form a shell outside of the ball and interact with the water molecules. &lt;br&gt;


----

&lt;big&gt;'''Types of Soap:'''&lt;/big&gt; 

The unique properties of different soaps are based on the type of fatty acid and length of the carbon chain of the molecule. 
Tallow or animal fats give primarily sodium stearate (18 carbons)- a very hard, insoluble soap. 
Fatty acids with longer chains are even more insoluble. As a matter of fact, zinc stearate is used in talcum powders because it is water repellent.

Coconut oil is a source of lauric acid (12 carbons) which can be made into sodium laurate. This soap, on the other hand, is very soluble and will lather easily even in sea water.

Fatty acids with only 10 or fewer carbons are not used in soaps because they irritate the skin and have objectionable odors. 


----

&lt;big&gt;'''Cleansing Action of Soap:'''&lt;/big&gt;

The cleansing action of soap is determined by its amphipathic properties- polar and non-polar structures, as well as its solubility characteristics. The long hydrocarbon chain is non-polar and hydrophobic (repelled by water); and the &quot;salt&quot; end of the soap molecule is ionic and hydrophilic (water soluble).

&lt;u&gt;Monolayer:&lt;/u&gt; 
As soap is combined with water, the ionic-salt end of the soap molecule is attracted to the water molecules and consequently dissolves in it. The non-polar hydrocarbon end of the soap molecule is repelled by the water molecules. A drop or two of soap in water forms a monolayer on the water surface. The soap molecules &quot;stand up&quot; on the surface as the polar carboxyl salt end is attracted to the polar water. The non-polar hydrocarbon tails are repelled by the water, which makes them appear to stand up. 


----

&lt;big&gt;'''Soap vs. Oil vs. Water:'''&lt;/big&gt;

Due to their opposite polarity, water by itself cannot penetrate grease or oil. However, when grease or oil (non-polar hydrocarbons) are mixed with a soap-water solution, the soap molecules work as a &quot;bridge&quot; between polar water molecules and non-polar oil molecules. Soap molecules are amphipathic and thus have both properties of non-polar and polar at opposite ends of the molecule.

The oil is a pure hydrocarbon so it is non-polar. The non-polar hydrocarbon tail of the soap dissolves into the oil. That leaves the polar carboxylate ion of the soap molecules are sticking out of the oil droplets, the surface of each oil droplet is negatively charged. As a result, the oil droplets repel each other and remain suspended in solution (this is called an emulsion) to be washed away by a stream of water. The outside of the droplet is also coated with a layer of water molecules. This is also similar to a micelle which works with the same principles- the center of the micelle would contain the oil.


----

&lt;big&gt;'''Effect of Hard Water:'''&lt;/big&gt;

When soap is used in &quot;hard&quot; water, it will be precipitated as a &quot;bath-tub ring&quot; by calcium or magnesium ions present in the &quot;hard&quot; water. The effects of &quot;hard&quot; water calcium or magnesium ions decrease with the addition of &quot;builders&quot;. The most common &quot;builder&quot; is sodium trimetaphosphate. The phosphates react with the calcium or magnesium ions thus keeping them in solution but away from the soap molecule. The soap molecule can then do its job without interference from calcium or magnesium ions. Other &quot;builders&quot; include sodium carbonate, borax, and sodium silicate, which are currently in detergents. 



----

&lt;big&gt;'''Shampoo:'''&lt;/big&gt;

Water is the primary ingredient in shampoo, making up 60-70% of its content. The ingredients in shampoo are most often biodegradable. Detergents are the next most abundant ingredients in shampoo. Detergents are surfactants that react with the surface in order to remove oil and dirt particles from the hair follicle. The insoluble portion aligns with the hair’s oil particles while the water soluble portion aligns on the outside, creating a micelle. Common detergents include ammonium laurel sulfate, sodium laurel sulfate, and sodium laurel ether sulfate. Sodium laurel ether sulphates are a popular ingredient in shampoos because of their biodegradability and ability to give a “foaming” effect. The sulphates are made from either natural or synthetic linear C12-C15 alcohols. Thickeners are then added in order to increase viscosity. Popular thickeners include sodium chloride and methylcellulose. Shampoo strips the hair of its sebum, which is required to protect the hair shaft. Therefore, shampoos must also contain an ingredient to replace the lost sebum. Silicones, polymers, and quaternary agents coat the hair and replace the lost sebum. Because shampoos consist of mostly water and organic compounds, preservatives such as parabens are added to prevent the growth of bacteria and maintain freshness.

      <comment>/* Role of Electroporation in Transformation */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Bacterial Transformation==
Bacterial Transformation is a basic technique that is commonly used in a molecular biological laboratory. The technique is performed by introducing a foreign plasmid into the bacteria and the bacteria is used to amplify the foreign DNA. Bacteria can replicate the foreign DNA if the foreign DNA has an origin of replication that its DNA polymerases can recognize. The bacteria will then replicate the foreign DNA along with its own. This new DNA strand can at times provide the organism with new trait(s) that can be identified after transformation.
===Role of Heat Shock in Transformation===
Heat Shock is subjecting a cell to a higher temperature than it is normally found in the organism. Heat Shock causes pores to form in the outer membrane which permits DNA to enter the cell. The heat source is then removed from the cell and the membrane reforms with the DNA inside

===Role of Electroporation in Transformation===
[[File:ELECTROPORATION.gif|thumb|foreign DNA inserts genes in eukaryote cells]]
The role of electroporation in transformation is the same as Heat Shock, though the method is different. In electroporation, an electric field is applied to the cell that has a significant increase in the electrical conductivity and permeability of the cell membrane which allows foreign DNA to enter the cell.
Bacteria also contain a cell wall made of peptidoglycan that are naturally porous and only act as a shell that protects the bacteria. If plasmids are mixed with bacteria, plasmids can be transferred into the cell after electroporation. The electric field in electroporation is created by appliances called electroporators.

===Role of Calcium Chloride in Transformation===
The addition of  Calcium Chloride produces calcium ions which help the cell membrane become more permeable to DNA plasmid. This method of disrupting the cell membrane using electronics is generally used in conjunction to heat shocking. In which drastic changes in temperature causes the membrane to be more porous, enabling a greater efficiency for the desired DNA segments to transform into the targeted bacteria. This method of competence is more effective when used with plasmid DNA than linear DNA since certain enzymes exist within the bacteria that readily degrade linear DNA.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Overview=
Bacterial and viral genes are not the only sequences that can be introduced into a host. Eukaryotic genes can be introduced into bacteria to produce a desired protein product. It is also possible to introduce DNA into higher organisms which has lead to gene therapy. Although the manipulation of eukaryotic genes holds many possibilities and advantages, it is also a source of controversy.

==Cloning Eukaryotic DNA==
Most eukaryotic DNA are interspersed with introns and exons that interrupt genes and cannot be expressed by bacteria. This obstacle is overcome by utilizing DNA that is complementary to mRNA (mRNA splices introns). The key to forming complementary DNA is Reverse Transcription which synthesizes a DNA strand complementary to an RNA template. Complementary DNA for all mRNA that a cell contains can be made, inserted into vectors, and then inserted into bacteria (Such a collection is called a cDNA library). 

Complementary DNA molecules can be inserted into vectors that favor their efficient expression in hosts, called expression vectors. In order to maximize transcription, the cDNA is inserted into the vector near a promoter. Clones can be screened on the basis of their capacity to direct the synthesis of a foreign protein in bacteria.

==Recombinant DNA in Higher Organisms==
Bacteria lack the necessary enzymes to carry out posttranslational modifications. Thus, many eukaryotic genes can be correctly expressed only in eukaryotic host cells. Recombinant DNA molecules can be introduced into animal cells in several ways. First, foreign DNA molecules precipitated by calcium phosphate are taken up by animal cells. Another method involves microinjecting DNA into cells. A third method utilizes viruses, specifically retroviruses since they usually do not kill their hosts and becomes randomly incorporated into host chromosomal DNA, to introduce new genes into animal cells. 

'''Moloney murine leukemia virus''' accepts inserts as long as 6 kilobase pairs and some genes introduced by this vector are efficiently expressed.
'''Vaccinia virus''' is a large DNA containing virus that replicates in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells where it shuts down host cell protein synthesis.
'''Baculovirus''' infects insect cells which can be easily cultured.

==Plant Cell Modifications==


[[File:Electroporation.jpg|thumb|Electroporation]]

What is '''Electroporation'''? is the method used to introduce the foreign DNA into plant cells by helping polar molecules to insert into a host cell through the cell membranes.  The process is to initiate a large electric fields to make the plasma membranes permeable to the polar molecules that are allowing the molecules to pass through the cell.

1st: the cellulose wall is removed by adding cellulase to produce protoplast.

2nd: applied electric fulses to disturb the hydrophobic membrane and make its permeable to plasmid DNA to enter.

3rd: The cell wall is then allowed to reform.


'''Electroporation:'''Tumor-inducing plasmids (Ti plasmids) carry instructions for the switch to the tumor state. Ti plasmids can deliver foreign genes into some plant cells by integrating into itself into the genome of an infected plant cells (T-DNA). Foreign DNA can be introduced into plant cells by electroporation. The cellulose walls are removed which produces protoplasts. Electric pulses are then applied to a suspension of protoplasts and plasmid DNA. The high electric fields make membranes transiently permeable to large molecules, and the plasmid DNA molecules enter the cells. When the cell wall reforms, the plant cells become viable. 

'''Gene Guns:''' The most effective means of transforming plant cells fires microprojectiles at the target cells.

Genetically modified organisms create plants with beneficial characteristics such as the ability to grow in poor soils, resistance to climatic variation, resistance to pests, and nutritional fortification. However, their uses are highly controversial because of unknown side effects.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several single molecule DNA sequencing (SMDS) techniques under development, yet only single molecule sequencing by cyclic
synthesis is currently advanced to the point that sequence information is produced in a massively parallel way directly from single DNA molecules. This sequencing technology relies on the use of fluorescently labeled nucleotides by DNA polymerase into complementary strands of DNA that are immobilized to a surface. The individual DNA strands are separated by a few microns and can be monitored as independent entities. The fluorescent signal of each incorporated labeled nucleotide is then sequentially detected using fluorescent microscopy. Since each DNA molecule is sequenced separately, there is no need for synchronization between different molecules. Tens of millions of molecules can be  sequenced in parallel in single small reaction volume, and thus this method readily produces high through put sequencing at a minimal cost. Currently this technique produces short reading lengths, which make it suitable to re-sequence applications in which a reference sequence is given. A single reference genome can serve as a template for the thousands of genomes produced by the short DNA fragments. This data can be used to find rare mutations and genetic heterogeneity in multiple target environments with great accuracy, high rates and low cost. The ability to extract a massive amount of sequence information will equip cancer research with a powerful tool needed to defeat various genetic diseases. 

Single molecule sequencing is a goal that has been pursued for almost two decades as a possible candidate to replace the Sanger method of sequencing. DNA sequencing by cyclic synthesis (SBS) differs from the Sanger method, which relies on length separation of amplified DNA strands that terminate with a particular color according to the last base in the chain. Instead, in SBS the synthesis itself is followed by various methods, which monitor many reactions in parallel and thus accelerate sequencing rate and reduce cost. Out of all the cycle-extension approaches, single molecule sequencing has the highest sequence information density, i.e. the number of sequence reads per unit area.

Current Sanger sequencing methods require a large amount of DNA to be replicated and then each of the sequencing runs is performed on one sequence at the time, a lengthy and expensive route. The alternative that DNA sequencing by cyclic synthesis offers is the sequencing of millions of fragments in parallel, and in the case of SMDS by cyclic synthesis no duplication of the DNA is needed at all. This combination would not only make whole genome sequencing far cheaper, it would also make it a lot faster. This would allow for rapid sequencing of numerous genomes and generate useful statistical comparisons. 

The basic scheme of SMDS by cyclic synthesis is as follows:

1) DNA is sheared and cut into short fragments

2) These fragments are elongated by a common DNA tail

3) The DNA fragments are immobilized onto a glass surface that contains primers that match the common DNA tail.

4) All bound fragments are then sequenced in parallel by -

4a) Polymerase extension of one base with a fluorescently labeled nucleotide.

4b) Detection by TIRM of multiple fields of view to record incorporation events on tens of millions of DNA fragments.

4c) Removal of the dye molecule.

4d) Return to 4a with a different nucleotide.

5) The data of each sequence is compared to a known sequence and aligned with it.

6) Data analysis from this alignment reveals the sequence information in the target DNA. 

The sequencing of DNA using single molecule fluorescence calls for careful experimental design in order to be able to observe the incorporation of single nucleotides into the DNA template. The goal is to collect the sequence information from each molecule by itself. As multiple fields of view are imaged in order to monitor incorporations on millions of templates simultaneously, techniques that precisely monitor the position of the molecules should be addressed. The sequence information from each molecule should then be aligned to the reference sequence. For long enough sequences, it is possible to align the found sequences to the reference even if there is disagreement or ‘error’. This ‘error’ could come from either a real error in the sequencing, or from the data under analysis – i.e. the mutations, polymorphism or heterogeneity that the re-sequencing reveals. In order to have enough statistics to provide a meaningful picture of the DNA sequence, an over-sampling is required which averages out random error, and reveals the sequence content of the sample. As the amount of strands that are sequenced at the same time is enormous, this is not a strong limitation on the method.

SMDS by cyclic synthesis is a technique that minimizes cost and enhances throughput over current Sanger sequencing methods. The ability to sequence millions of bases in parallel at very high density and high data rates, without the constraint ofsynchronous incorporations, establishes this method as a viable option for massive DNA resequencing applications. Significant reductions in reagent use, combined with minimal sample preparation, contribute to lower the cost and time of the resequencing, as well as virtually eliminating the amplification biases. The microfluidic implementation of this method could reduce, even further, the cost of the reagents and of the device as a whole. Further, the use of Förster Resonant Energy Transfer as a local illumination source in single molecule sequencing by fluorescence is useful for reducing noise and false positive signals from unspecific binding of nucleotides, and is applicable in other situations where a tightly confined excitation light is desirable. The use of cleavable fluorescent markers substantially increases the read lengths in single molecule sequencing as steric interactions between adjacent dyes are eliminated. Further increase in read length is anticipated by optimizing reaction conditions and by choice of the DNA polymerase used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''A. Introduction'''

One of the most significant contributions of Recombinant DNA technology is the ability to manipulate the DNA of microorganisms. Also, referred to as Recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology, this manipulation of DNA involves the insertion of DNA segments from various organisms into a different host (rDNA host). This is often practiced through the use of a vector which allows for the DNA  to replicate in the host cell producing a new manipulated microorganism. Thus, the practice of the manipulation of microorganisms has been the focus of hundreds of companies, laboratories, and even governmental agencies. The reason that the manipulation of DNA microorganisms is such a studied topic is the benefits it could provide on a economic level. Possible areas of the use of manipulated microbes include as a organism for degrading environmental contaminants, pesticides, providing protection for agricultural crops, in medicine, etc. The release of genetically engineered microorganisms (GEM) however has been a much disputed topic. The worries are the 
effects that would result from the addition of genetically altered microorganisms to the environment. The two main concerns are 1. host cells could contain pathogenic genes in the rDNA that was originally unknown which provides threats to all living organisms. 2. 
the altered organisms might have effects on the ecosystem especially in terms of evolution and providing an organism an advantage of another possibly altering such things as the nutrient cycle, energy flow, and ecosystem. This is the main reason that the addition of GEM to the environment (genetically engineered microorganisms) must be carefully studied and regulated. Research though therefore has been done therefore do identify genetically altered microorganisms in the environment led by three researchers from the University of Tennessee. 

'''B. Requirements for rDNA Environmental Monitoring'''

In order for a technique method/applied to observe and search for genetically engineered microorganisms in the environment, a series of questions must first be asked to determine if a method is valid and/or a realistic technique. 

1. It should be applicable under a wide variety of environmental conditions
2. It should be suitable for technical application in terms of its simplicity. 
3. It should be able to detect, identify and enumerate the GEMs
4. It should be sensitive and specific to detect a small population
5. It should be capable of differentiating the specific GEMS from the other organisms in the environment
6. It should be able to discriminate GEMS from other strains of the same species 
7. It should be efficient, cost effective, and time-economic. 

These methods reflect the rules determined by the three scientists from the University of Tennessee

'''C. Conventional Methods'''

I. Selective Plating and Enrichment Techniques 

The process of selective plating of microorganisms involves the presence of a selective media. The selective media can be made differential on basis of physical growth conditions (temperature, oxygen concentration) or constituents. In terms of detecting the rDNA of microorganisms, plating only selects for the rDNA host rather than a specific rDNA sequence. Complex media are used to accommodate the complexity of rDNA host which allows for the differentiation between the non recombinant strains. Furthermore, this technique is only considered a preliminary technique because it must be considered presumptive, which requires conformation for an rDNA to be present. 

II. Enumeration by the Most-Probable-Number (MPN) Method 

In this method, samples are first diluted to extinction and then viable cells are allowed to grow in tubes of appropriate medium.
Then, a probability theory is performed to determine the original density of the population. The medium used determines both selection or enrichment and a species growth and activity thus it is another method of differentiation. There are some drawbacks however to this method which includes the necessity to use a large number of dilutions and tubes in order for precision. 

III. Epifluorescence Count Technique

The technique involves concentrating the bacteria onto membrane filters, then staining the bacteria, and then counting the bacteria by microscopy. This technique know is not applied as much for GEM because of the fact that it lacks specificity like 
the other conventional techniques. 

Weaknesses of the Conventional Method

1.  weakness is that the technique lacks specificity. 2. technique require the growth of target organisms and consequently will underestimate or produce false-negative results if organisms are stressed at a immediate time of sampling. 3. there is no universal medium that allows growth of all potential host organisms within the sample. 

'''D. Developing Methods'''

I. Immunological Techniques-The technique involves the use of antibodies (either polyclonal and monoclonal antisera) providing 
a sensitive and specific technique for identifying GEM.  

II. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent assay (ELISA)- This biochemical technique involves the use of a particular antibody that is used to find a specific antigen, or vice versa in which a particular antigen is used to detect a particular antibody. This process is sensitive and specific, which might reflect its value when locating GEM (genetically engineered microorganisms). 

III. Radioactive Markers-This technique involves the conjugation of some radioactive species, which allows for Genetically engineered microorganisms to be marked radioactively. The main drawback though is the cost and high amounts of radioactive use. 

IV. Fluorescent Markers- This technique also involves the use of a antibody that is conjugated to a fluorescent dye. The antibody is added to a sample of interest and therefore could be observed by fluorescence microscopy. 

V. Use of Plasmid Epidemiology and Restriction Profiles (DNA fingerprinting)-This technique is a method to study specific genetic engineered microorganisms by specifically studying the plasmid of the microorganisms. The plasmids are separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and studied by staining the gel by ethidium bromide and observing by ultraviolet light. 

VI. Use of Selectable Genotypic Markers-Two different markers can be used to study GEM

1. chromogenic markers

2. antibody or heavy resistance markers-many of these markers are found in plasmids or transposons which can be used to incorporate into bacterial chromosomes. 

The markers could be placed on either the plasmid or the chromosome of the microorganism. 

VII. Use of nucleic Acid Sequence Analysis

VIII. Nucleic Acid Hybridization Techniques

IX. DNA: DNA Colony Hybridization 

X. Southern Blot Hybridization 

XI. Nucleic Acid Hybridization with DNA Extracts

XII. DNA: RNA Hybridization 

XIII. Use of Biotinlyated Probes

Today the page [[Computer Programming/Language concepts]] was deleted
[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=Computer+Programming%2FLanguage+concepts&amp;year=2009].
(What about [[Talk:Computer Programming/Language concepts]]?).
As far as I can see, it was deleted without discussion.
I'm not sure if this is connected to the [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion/Computer Programming]] debate.

I think that &quot;language concepts&quot; seems like a reasonable name for part of a book on computer programming.
As far as I can tell, the content of that page was what [[Help:Etiquette#Votes for deletion]] calls &quot;a good faith effort to start something useful.&quot;
And so I think that page should be undeleted and perhaps listed on VfD.
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 19:57, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

:I remember a vfd for the deletion of the complete book (that IIRC failed). Can you place here any information if the same person/admin executed the deletion or if it was a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; request. Have you contacted the executor of the action before requesting the undeletion (since this is not a reversal of a vfd). If so I've always been of the opinion that the status quo rules over bold edits and that consensus means no stated opposition (that makes the last change non consensual by your opposition to it)... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:47, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

:: Is that a requirement to get a page undeleted?
:: If so, ''please'' edit the top of this page to add that requirement of which I was previously unaware.
:: ''&quot;same person&quot;''? No. The links I already posted show that ( [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=Computer+Programming%2FLanguage+concepts&amp;year=2009] ) Adrignola deleted the page, while ( [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion/Computer Programming]] ) darklama started the VfD on the whole [[Computer Programming]] book, which was closed as keep.
:: ''&quot;contacted&quot;'' ? Hang on ... OK, I've dropped a note at [[User talk:Adrignola]]. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 21:32, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

::: Starting a request for undeletion means that you are asking if any Wikibookiane opposes the undeletion (even people that weren't aware or have a real involvement with the issue, it can even promote band wagoning if the subject is volatile), for what I remembered (correctly by the above reply) there wasn't a vfd validating the deletion and so a it falls into personal judgment that only fits a be bold edit action (deletion, moving or any edit per default goes under this category, if no reaching of consensus validated the action). In this case you are left objecting to a administrative action (deletion) that can easily be reverted (if people are in good will) or you can even be persuaded to agree with the deletion. In this case you would have only to address that one single user opinion/view on the issue...
::: Making a disagreement more visible that it merits can be a barrier to reach an commonly accepted outcome. I think it can be more agreeable and simpler to wait and see if [[User:Adrignola]] agrees with the reversal or you decide to drop the request after he explains his reasons for the action before this process proceeds any further.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:01, 23 July 2009 (UTC)

'''This page was deleted on the 22 of June, not today. The VfD discussion closed on the 9 of July. This action was prior to closing.'''

A good deal of pages of [[Computer Programming]] have been merged with other books or moved into other books. The VfD ended as keep to allow for additional merging/moving or the development of the book further. This particular page only links to other books and did not have meaningful content at the time I deleted it. My goal at the time was to try to move/merge all the pages of [[Computer Programming]] and delete anything that did not have meaningful content. I somewhat agreed with Darklama's assessment of the book but did not want to delete the pages outright.  This page was, in my opinion, an exception.  You disagree (or maybe you'll agree upon viewing the page), so the page has been restored.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:32, 23 July 2009 (UTC)

This book was deleted back in 2006. I am guessing it was deleted because the &quot;content was: 'France in Revolution' (and the only contributor was '172.142.196.73)')&quot;.  This content was probably intended to link to [[A-level Ancient History/French Revolution]].  I could not find anther book on A-level history to merge this into, so thought it may make sense to restore the stub. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:03, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

:Not much content, really, but it's been restored.  What you see is what it had, with the addition of the modern categories of today. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:07, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

: '''Opposed'''. Keep this deleted. There is no content, just a single link that was changed a few times. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:48, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

:: Ok, there is really nothing to the book, I just wanted its subpage to end up somewhere it would be seen.  I moved the subpage to the [[French History]] book, which was missing a section on the french revolution.  This seems like a better place anyways, because I don't think the french revolution generally falls under ancient history. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 14:12, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

:: With the above merge (which I think is a great place for it) the page in question has been deleted once again. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:21, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Chemical Structures==

Detergents are primarily made up of ''surfactants'', or “surface active agents” of which reduce the surface tension of water by adsorbing at the common boundary between liquid and gas or one liquid and another. Surfactants form into aggregates known as micelles, formations of amphiphilic lipids. In micelles, the amphiphilic lipid has a tail that forms a core that encapsulates an oil droplet or dirt particle and a head that maintains contact with the surrounding water environment. To work effectively, the chemical formation of micelles is not enough to remove oil or grease; mechanical energy (scrubbing or water flow) is often required.

	  Surfactants can be formed from petrochemical or oleochemicals, chemical products made from raw materials such as petroleum or other hydrocarbon substances (olefin or aromatics). Alkalis and oxidizing agents are other components of detergents. Alkalis provide positively charged cations that can trigger chemical reactions. Oxidizing agents can act as a source of energy for chemical reactions and include sulfuric acid and ethylene dioxide.

	Detergents can also be composed of substances that can modify pH of other components, as well as water softeners (compounds that reduce metal ion concentration) and enzymes that digest proteins or fats. In addition, detergents can comprise of ingredients that modify the presence of foam or stabilize the viscosity of a solution.
                                           
&lt;big&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;-CO-O-(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C-OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Properties==

•Nonionic detergents, which form electrically neutral colloidal particles in solution,  contain non-ionic emulsifiers, amplifying the ability to remove oily residues. These nonionic surfactants are low-foaming and have defoaming properties that improve wetting, rinsing and particle removal while not hindering with mechanical labor. A common nonionic detergent is Liquinox used to clean glassware and does not react with hard water ions; this is due to the fact that no ionic groups exist to do so. In addition, it foams less than ionic detergents but has some polar portions to provide necessary water solubility.

•Cationic detergents often come in powder foam and have a long cationic chain that is responsible for surfactant properties. However, cationic detergents are poor detergents even though they have adequate emulsifying properties. Instead, there are often used in bacterica/germ free environments due to their antiseptic properties.

•Anionic detergents are based on sulfate or carboxylate anions and are of the most common modern synthetic detergents producing negative charged colloidal ions in solution.


•Bile salts in the stomach have emulsifying properties in the digestive system, reacting with fats and oils as a detergent to form smaller particles of the consumed compounds. In addition, the same amphipathic properties that allow bile acids to emulsify using lipids also make them membrane-disruptive mediums.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Identification of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) ==

Major efforts have been made in recent years to identify the SNPs in the Human Genome.  While previously known as base substitutions, the term SNP has become more common, indicating the importance of this frequent type of base substitution in molecular genetics.  An SNP refers to an abundant base substitution, which differs from a rare substitution in that the population has a frequency of greater than 1% of the least abundant allele.  Due to the high density of SNPs in genomes, several can usually be located within a few hundred base pairs.  Thus, they are a rich source of information for population studies, and the association of genetic factors with disease states.

SNPs are used constantly in the field of disease study. For instance, they are used to identify the multiple genes that are involved in such common diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and certain versions of mental illness.


==Polymorphisms and Disease==
Approximately five hundred human methyltransferase polymorphisms have been identified and have been linked to disease.  A polymorphic hotspot was identified at approximately 20 angstrom from the active site in four out of seven protein studied in the research performed by Karen Rutherford and Valerie Daggett.  Simulations outlining the molecular dynamics of proteins demonstrated a mutual mechanism of destabilization.  The common mechanism is the fact that the mutations change the side chain contacts within the polymorphic site that are sent throughout the protein causing a distortion to the active site.  One theory is that these hot spots may have evolved to modulate enzymatic activity.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms occur at a frequency of 1 in every 1000 nucleotide bases of the 3 billion base human genome.  SNPs can affect mRNA transcription, structure, enzymatic activity, and stability.  Catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) is a protein displayed to have ample inter-individual differences in enzymatic activity.   Restriction fragment length polymorphism mapping acknowledged that the alterations in activity are accredited to a valine to methionine substitution. The alternative consequently decreased the levels in vivo.   This substitution has been linked with an increased in risk of breast cancer and neuropsychiatric diseases.

Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TMPT) is at fault for the metabolism of cytotoxic thioputine drugs employed to medicate multiple conditions like leukemia and inflammatory bowel disease. In eleven percent of the population there has been more than twenty TPMT polymorphisms. NMR is important to understanding how the polymorphism affects protein structure and dynamics because structure dictates function. Molecular dynamic (MD) studies are of peak interest when understanding the effects of polymorphism because aggregation or stability issues do not bother them. MD allows one to notice how the mutations affect protein structure at an atomic level. MD demonstrates how COMT and TMPT polymorphisms affect structural detail. Research has demonstrated that polymorphisms contain destabilizing effects. TPMT was found to decrease the levels of immunological protein. Researchers now contain much epidemiological data for the wild type and variant COMT and TMPT proteins that make them more likely to be studied through MD simulations. The data known can be applied to molecule development for the stabilization of protein structure and activators for the treatments of diseases.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The human genome sequence has revealed two new globins, neuroglobin and cytoglobin.  These proteins are both monomeric, and resemble myoglobin more than hemoglobin.  Neuroglobin is expressed in the brain and in the retina.  Its roles include protecting neural tissues from hypoxia, insufficient oxygenation of the blood or tissue.  Cytoglobin is expressed throughout the body.  Spectroscopy exhibits that the proximal and sital histidines are coordinated to iron in the deoxy form in both proteins.  The distal histidine is displaced on oxygen binding.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some viruses enter their host cells by attaching to cell-surface carbohydrates.  The influenza virus in particular, attaches to sialic acid residues on the terminai of the oligosaccharides presentnear the cell-surface glycoproteins and glycolipids.

[[Image:Phage2.JPG|thumb|A pictoral representation of the lytic and lysogenic cycles.]]

[[Image:Hiv gross.png|thumb|The HIV virus and a brief summary of its replication cycle.]]

Once attached, viruses inject their own genetic material and take over the cell's machinery to produce more viruses. The cell can undergo a lytic or lysogenic cycle. In the lytic cell, the cell is taken over, produces viruses with its own machinery and organelles, and then dies, releasing more viruses. In the lysogenic cycle, the cell does not die but instead replicates with viral DNA/RNA in its own genome. A common example of a lysogenic virus is lambda phage. However, lambda phage can also enter the lytic cycle. In this manner, some viruses can remain dormant for years at a time, activating under certain environmental conditions to begin replication under the lytic cycle.

There are several different types of viruses, including DNA, RNA, and retroviruses. DNA viruses usually replicate by taking over the cell's DNA, whereas RNA viruses tend to replicate in the cytoplasm. Retroviruses transcribe their DNA into host DNA via reverse transcription- an example of this is HIV. 

The body has several defense mechanisms against viruses. The body's first line of defense is the innate immune response, which is non-specific and defends the body against a variety of threats. Inflammation, coughing, sneezing, and a variety of other non-specific defense mechanisms are examples of the innate immune response in action. The adaptive immune system, on the other hand, targets specific threats. T Cell and antibody activation are examples of the adaptive immune system's defense mechanisms. In addition, scientists have developed vaccines and anti-viral drugs to assist the immune system and/or disrupt viral replication mechanisms. 

Lymphocytes, or white blood cells, are the body's main defenders against foreign invaders. There are two major types of lymphocytes, T cells and B cells. Of the T cells, there are T helper, cytotoxic, memory, regulatory, and natural killer cells. Each type of T cell has its own purpose in immune response. Helper cells assist and activate other cells at the first signs of infection, cytotoxic T cells destroy infected cells, preventing more viruses from being released, memory cells store antigens, allowing the body to quickly recognize previous infections to make fighting future infections more efficient, regulatory T cells shut down immune response after an infection has subsided, and natural killer cells can help kill tumor cells. B cells, on the other hand, recognize antigens and develop anti-bodies once the correct antigen for an infection has been found. 

Viruses are parasites because they can't survive on their own. They infect a cell and use the infected cell to multiply and make more viruses. Viruses are considered alive because they are capable of duplication and have defensive mechanisms. All viruses have some sort of genome, which can be single or double stranded, DNA or RNA, and linear or circular. A virus genome is also very small: they could be four genes or a few hundred when prokaryotes tend to have several thousands of genes and eukaryotes tend to have tens of thousands of genes. 
Viruses have a protein coat that protects the genome, and this coat is made up of protein. Usually, the coat has multiple copies of '''one''' protein because the virus wants to minimize its genome. Viruses want to pack up and ship off new copies of viruses as soon as possible, so if the genome is longer and more varied, then the longer the packing will take because it will have to encode for several different genes; thus, viruses would be at a great disadvantage if they had variety in their genome. 

== What is A Virus? ==

A virus is an infectious, parasitic agent that can only replicate inside other host cells.  All viruses have a genome and a capsid.

A viral genome can be:&lt;/br&gt;
•Single stranded (ss) or double stranded (ds)&lt;/br&gt;
•DNA or RNA&lt;/br&gt;
•Linear or circular&lt;/br&gt;

[[File:Virus-types-vi.png]]

Compared to others, the viral genome is very small.  It consists of two to several hundred genes.  Prokaryotes, like bacteria, have thousands of genes, while eukaryotes can have tens of thousands of genes.  

Viruses were once thought to have been a self-replicating genetic element but the guiding principle which differentiates the two is that “once a replicon incorporates a gene(s) that allows it to make a capsid to enclose the replicon, then a functional and structural entity called a virion is produced.” This means that the hallmark of a functional virus is a virion. &lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;

The capsid is a protein coat that surround the genome.  It consists of several copies of a single protein, which is advantageous for the virus because it only needs one gene to code for the capsid protein.  The capsid and it's enclosed genome is also referred to as a nucleocapsid.

Some viruses also have a membrane bilayer around the nucleocapsid that can serve as a protective layer.  This can be found in viruses that have already infected a host cell, and have budded off from the host cell.

Viral proteins have structures that are different from eukaryotic proteins in that they are loosely packed due to relatively fewer hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions. &lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;

Viral proteins are small proteins with many disordered segments and many coil residues. The coil residues cause the protein to be loosely packed because the coil conformation (a secondary structure) is unorganized and does not easily lie near another protein strand. &lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;

In addition, viruses are not considered living organisms as they fail to fulfill the basic requirements of life to be considered living. Although viruses replicate, they are not able to metabolize food. Viruses do not have an organized cell structure, it does not respond to any external stimuli when placed under such circumstances, nor do they maintain homeostasis in which internal temperature is attempted to be kept at a constant. Additionally, viruses do not belong to any animal kingdom, they are unable to adapt to environments, and their only method of reproduction is through invading host cells, but not being able to reproduce independently.

== Origin of Viruses ==

The exact origin of viruses has been questioned by scientists for decades. Although there are many theories on the origin, there are three hypotheses that have been discussed at greater lengths about the origin of viruses.

1. Viruses originated from ancient times before cellular life was invented
This hypothesis has been rejected many based on the idea that viruses need a cellular host in order to survive. If viruses existed before cellular life existed then they would not have had the ability to replicate in a host cell.

2. Viruses originated from cells by reduction.
This hypothesis is rejected on the premise that this method requires intermediates between cells and viruses which have yet to be found.

3. Viruses escaped from cells by utilizing cellular replication elements removed from cellular control.
This hypothesis doesn't explain how it is possible to build complex virion structures. Also since it has been found that viruses are capable to infecting cells in all three domains, it has been proven that they are ancient and not from reduced cells. Also the discovery of the mimivirus somewhat refutes this hypothesis.

When comparing a two different plant viruses, scientists were able to see the similarity in capsid structure and similarities in the arrangement within the capsid. When comparing two animal viruses, they were not only found to be similar to each other but also to plant viruses based on their coat protein folds. They all shared the stranded beta barrel folding. Plant, insect, and human viruses showed to share similar structural architecture which therefore led to the conclusion that ssRNA viruses may share a common ancestor. In addition to the ssRNA, after more comparisons, scientists saw that even dsDNA and bacterial viruses shared the same basic architect as ssRNA viruses; they all used the beta barrel fold. By comparing various viruses, it has been discovered that a common ancestor infected cells of all three domains before diversification. &lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;

== Virus Classification ==
Viruses are classified under two different classifications: the Baltimore Scheme and the International Committee on Taxonomy of Virus(ICTV).

The Baltimore Scheme divides all the various viruses into seven groups depending on their chemical type, number of strands, and if their single strand is capable of directly undergoing translation. The seven categories of viruses are dsDNA, ssDNA, dsRNA, plus(sense) ssRNA, minus(antisense) ssRNA, ssRNA with DNA intermediate, and dsDNA with RNA intermediate.

The second classification categorizes viruses into order, family, genus, species. The organization of the virus lineages is based on the information on the type of host cell each virus infects. Although the ICTV try to organize the viruses to the best of their ability, it is still difficult to designate a majority of the families to orders. &lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;

== Viral Structures ==
Viral structures have been found to be the unifying component within the viral universe. Viruses have several set structures and do not deviate from these structures. They can be icosahedral, helical, a combination of the two, bottle-shaped, lemon-shaped, and spindle shaped. Some viruses are also pleomorphic; they have a lipid envelope.

For classification purposes, the capsid structure has been declared to be the crucial element. The process of replication and the genomic structure were considered as an element in classification but because of the lack of information they provide for identity, it has been ruled out. The capsid structure is the main structural component that is congruent to the identity of the virus. &lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;

== Viral Reproduction ==

Viruses are obligate (imposed by necessity; incapable of adaptation to different conditions; restricted to a particular mode of life) intracellular parasites.  They reproduce only within a host cell.  Viruses contain no metabolic enzymes or &quot;machinery&quot; for protein synthesis.  They can only infect a limited range/type of host cell (some viruses can infect several species, such as the rabies virus; some viruses can only infect one species; and animal viruses are usually tissue or cell-type specific; that is they will only infect one particular type of cell).  Steps of viral life cycle (viral binds to host cell; lock and key fit between viral protein and host cell surface receptor; viral genome, via variety of mechanisms, enters cell; viral genome 'commandeers' its host, using host cells machinery to copy viral genome and synthesize viral proteins; DNA viruses usually use the host cell's DNA polymerase-such as reverse transcriptase).

[[File:Virus Replication.svg]]

== Animal Viruses ==

Animal Viruses are very diverse with many modes of reproduction.  Many animal viruses have outer membrane (viral envelopes).  Typically there is a lipid bilayer (derived from the host cell plasma membrane) with virally encoded proteins protruding from it.  These virally encoded proteins are important for binding and helps virus enter the host cell.

Herpes virus envelop derive from nuclear envelope (herpes virus genome integrated into host cell DNA - as provirus).  Usually the virus remains latent.  But stress causes virus to become active. The provirus leaves genome and initiates viral production.  Blisters form as a result.

== DNA Viruses ==

There are two types of DNA viruses: double stranded DNA viruses and single stranded DNA viruses.

•Double stranded DNA viruses, such as the Small Pox virus, are able to use DNA polymerase to replicate itself, RNA polymerase to transcribe mRNA, wherein it will then use the host cell's ribosomes to produce proteins.  

•Single stranded DNA viruses will have to use DNA polymerase twice to replicate its own genome (first synthesized strand will be a conjugated gene expression of the viral genome), but they can still use RNA polymerase to produce mRNA and the host cell's ribosomes to produce proteins.

== RNA Viruses ==

There are three types of RNA viruses: double stranded RNA viruses, single stranded RNA viruses, and the retrovirus.  Unlike DNA viruses, RNA viruses can use RNA replicase to replicate in a host.  

•In a double stranded RNA viruses, each strand is considered to be viral mRNA.  RNA replicase can be used to both duplicate the genome and produce viral proteins.  

•There further exist two types of single stranded RNA viruses, positive and negative.  In positive SS RNA viruses, the RNA is known as a &quot;sense&quot; strand, and acts as the mRNA.  RNA replicase will make a complement of the mRNA, which can then act as a template to replicate it's genome.  Positive SS RNA viruses also use RNA replicase to translate proteins.  In negative SS RNA viruses, their genome is considered a &quot;nonsense&quot; strand, and is not the same as the mRNA strand.  As a result, RNA replicase must make a template strand off of the &quot;nonsense&quot; strand and this can then be used to produce proteins.  It also serves as a template to replicate new, &quot;nonsense&quot; RNA.

•Retroviruses are also single stranded RNA viruses, however, their genome is converted into double stranded DNA through viral reverse transcriptase.  First, Reverse transcriptase will make a DNA/RNA hybrid strand using the original single stranded RNA genome.  Then it will use the newly synthesized single stranded DNA template to make a double stranded DNA, and then integrate it into the host genome where it will be duplicated during the host cell's cell cycle.

== Viroids and Prions ==

Viroids are small molecules of naked RNA that infect plants.
Prions are infectious proteins (cause a number of degenerative brain disease).  Brain diseases: mad cow diseases, scrapie in sheep, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. It may be a misfolded version of a normal protein, which redirects protein folding in infected cells.  This generates more misfolded protein which can infect other cells.

== Fighting Viruses ==

'''Host Cell Defenses'''

Viruses are often hard to see in cells because their &quot;envelope&quot; makes them look like parts of the host cell.  However, if the cell sees double stranded RNA, it alerts the cell that something is wrong.  Double stranded RNA is considered to be foreign, and once it is spotted, dicer enzyme will cleave it into smaller RNA pieces.  RNA interference (RNAi) will come and destroy the small double stranded RNA pieces.  Double stranded RNA will also signal transcription to stop, and increase the amount of ribonucleases, an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of RNA.  This will get rid of all the double stranded RNA as well.  Once all the double stranded RNA is destroyed, transcription will continue as normal.

If a virus inhibits dicer and the cell can't eliminate the virus inside the cell, the infected host cell will be tagged for apoptosis.

An immune response through the Major Histocompatibility Complex I (MHC I) occurs as well.  MHC I are involved in antigen presentation.  Once the host cell cleaves the virus into smaller pieces, MHC I can present the antigen outside the cell, which can then be recognized by T cells and promote antibody production to help kill the infected cells.

'''Treatments'''

Viruses have structures that easily change conformation to adapt to new hosts and conditions, which explain how they elude drug treatments.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; For example, there are new flu shots available every year to combat new strains of the flu virus, which arise from minor mutations that allow them to better exist in certain conditions.

Antibiotics do not work on viruses, instead, vaccines are synthesized invitro.  Vaccines are made through purified viral proteins.  The purified protein, lacking the virulent genomic information, can be cleaved into pieces and injected into a host.  This way, the host will not risk the virus infecting its cells, rather, the body will recognize the cleaved pieces as foreign antigen from the virus and mount an immune response against it.  This enables the immune system to have antibodies prepared and be ready in the event of a real infection.

Reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) are a type of antiretroviral drugs, that target RNA viruses such as HIV infections. RTI is used to inhibit the activity of reverse transcriptase which is a required enzyme that allows the reproduction of viruses. By inhibiting transcription, viral DNA is unable to be transcribed from RNA, which halts the viral infection cycle. However, with time HIV infected cells will eventually mutate into another form with a different kind of reverse transcriptase tag unaffected by antiretroviral drugs usually across a span of about five years.

Flu shots usually contain 3 different types of inactivated viruses, because researchers cannot always predict the exact type of virus that plays the biggest role in the seasonal flu. They hypothesize the protein structures of the 3 that have the highest probability and put those into the vaccine.

'''Resistance'''

Many antiviral agents are inhibitors that appear like the actual molecule that the virus' proteins want to bind to.  By taking the place of the actual protein, the inhibitor is able to act like a &quot;decoy&quot; and block up the active site of the virus' protein and help stop the virus' life cycle.

Because the virus' protein's active site cannot easily be changed, the effectiveness of the inhibitor being used depends on how well it fits into the active site.  Thus, oftentimes, the closer that the inhibitor's structure is to the actual molecule that usually fits into the active site, the more effective the inhibitor.  It has been found through clinical tests that the closer the inhibitor's structure is to the actual substrate, the higher the barrier to resistance by the virus.  

Viruses also have machinery that allows them to fuse with host cells. This fusion machinery has also become a primary target of drugs. Viruses such as HIV have shown that membrane fusion follows the formation of a six-helix bundle. This bundle is created through a pathway in which there is a trimeric coiled-coil intermediate which can associate with the target membrane by use of a &quot;fusion peptide&quot; at the N-terminal end. 

Large problems with viral resistance have arisen.  Higher than normal rates of viral resistance within a population can often be attributed to patient use of the antiviral agent.  By not taking the proper dose or not using the drug for the prescribed duration of time helps lead to viral resistance.  This is because without the proper dosage of the drug (i.e.: less taken than prescribed), not enough of the inhibitor is present to take the place of the actual substrate.  Thus, strains of the virus that are only mildly resistant to the drug and would normally die under the prescribed conditions will end up surviving and passing on its resistance genes to its progeny.  After a certain amount of time, this weak resistance is able to become strong enough after multiple mutations to fight off the antiviral agent, even under prescribed conditions.  Through the selection process of non-resistant strains being removed from the genepool, more and more strains are becoming resistant.

A large problem with anti-viral resistance is the responsibility that everyone in a given population has to help prevent its spread.  One person's negligence in not taking his or hers prescription properly can help the resistant strain spread - giving other people less of a fighting chance when they themselves become infected.  Unfortunately, even with the utmost diligence in following a given prescription, viruses can still become resistant after a certain amount of time.  So even though resistant viral strains are ultimately becoming more and more common no matter what we do, people should still take personal responsibility to wholeheartedly follow a given regiment to help slow the spread of this phenomenon.

== Viral Benefits ==

There are a few benefits that viruses provide for humans.

•Viruses can help us to understand our cellular machinery.

•Viruses attack harmful insects and bacteria.

•Viruses also provide a hope for gene therapy.  Gene therapy is the process of introducing foreign DNA into a cell.  In theory, one can obtain an empty virus (one that's had it's disease causing genome removed), load it with a specific DNA, amplify the virus through PCR to have a specific protein that can target receptors on a specific cell, and have it inject the DNA into the cell.  For example, cystic fibrosis occurs due to the lack of CFTR, so in theory, one can load an empty virus with CFTR DNA, tag it with something that's specific for lung receptors, and inject it into a host.  However, in reality this is very difficult to do.  Furthermore, viruses have a relatively high transfection rate.  In other words, they are able to successfully transmit their genetic material into the host cell at a high rate and with less complications than more traditional methods that often cause unnecessary cell death.

== Influenza ==

The influenza virus is a negative single stranded RNA virus.  2 types pose the greatest threats to humans: type A and type B.  It has eight strands of RNA that encode for eleven different genes.  These genes are then translated into many different proteins, but two major types of viral proteins are:

•Hemagglutinin (HA), 16 different antigens exist
Hemagglutinin is found on the surface of the viral protein and binds to the sugars.

•Neuraminidase (NA), 9 different antigens exist
Neuraminidase (sialidase) cleaves the oligosaccharide chains which releases the virus' progeny to infect other cells.
This viral protein has been targeted for anti-Influenza treatment.  Neuraminidase inhibitors including Zanamivir and Oseltamivir (2 anti-Influenza drugs) are different structural analogs of the substrate that attempt to fit into the virus' neuraminidase binding site in order to prevent it from attaching to the actual cellular receptor.
10 distinct forms of neuraminidase have been discovered - 9 of them called &quot;N1, N2, N3, ..., N9&quot; for Type A Influenza and &quot;Type B neuraminidase&quot; for Type B Influenza.  Although Type A and B's neuraminidase catalytic machinery are essentially the same, differences in the amino acid sequence in other regions of the protein cause slightly different reactions of each towards various neuraminidase inhibitors.

Current research in neuraminidase inhibitors has found that many analogs of current inhibitors preferentially bind to Type A influenza over Type B, making them poor choices as inhibitors.  These changes that make the inhibitor select preferentially for Type A include analogs of the carboxamide chain in Neu5Ac2en.

The N1, N4, and N8 subtypes of neuraminidase in Type A Influenza are special, relative to the other subtypes because they contain an additional subsite within the binding site.  The amino acid sequence responsible for this has not yet been identified.  Furthermore, no biological function has been found to be associated with this additional subsite.

HA is a viral protein that binds to the host cell for entry.  It specifies which cells can be infected.  NA is the viral protein that is responsible for viral release by cleaving the HA/host cell interaction.

Influenza strains consist of different combinations of HA and NA, as well as other viral proteins.

A growing concern among many is the lethality behind the different strains of influenza.  For example, the Bird Flu, Swine Flu, and the common flu.

•Bird Flu (H5N1): This strand does not infect humans easily and is not easily spread.  There have only been 400 cases in the last 5 years, however, there were 262 deaths, giving H5N1 ~65% mortality rate (11/2009).  H5N1 targets the lungs, and while it is not something many have to be concerned with at the present time, it will grow to be a very severe problem if the strand mutates into a form where transmission can occur from human to human.

•Swine Flu (H1N1): This strand, unlike H5N1, infects humans easily and can be spread easily.  There have been 14-34 million estimated cases, with around 2,500-6,000 deaths, giving H1N1 less than a 0.01% mortality rate (11/2009).  This shows that H1N1 is not very virulent, which is very good for humans. However, if the strand ever becomes able to mutate into a virulent form, it would become a very severe problem.

•Common Flu: The common flu is constantly mutating each year, and there is an estimate of 25-50 million cases a year with around 30,000-40,000 deaths.

== Resistance ==

When Neu5Ac2en analogs were cultured with neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant influenza viruses, off-target mutations in receptor-binding sites of hemagglutinin occurred. This revealed a balance between the efficiency of demolition by neuraminidase and hemagglutinin’s affinity for the receptor.

[[File:Hemagglutinin molecule.png]]

Experiments were done with the catalytic site variants of neuraminidase. There was a resistant virus chosen by one of the carboxamide analogs that had shown a mutation in one of the three argininyl residues, R292. That same mutation is a characteristic known to all neuraminidases. A loss of enzyme activity can be achieved by substitution to K292, but a large loss of binding potency to carboxamide analogs of Neu5Ac2en will also occur. E276 has been proven to change the conformation of carboxamides bound with R292K variant to allow the hydrophobic pocket to bind. The interaction of E276 and R224 creates the hydrophobic binding pocket, but the resistance comes from the R292K variant. The resistance is a hydrogen bond between E276 and K292 seen in the crystal structure of the unliganded R292K variant. 

[[File:Neuraminidase.jpg]]

The less the inhibitor resembles the substrate the greater the loss of inhibitory potency directed at R292K N9 neuraminidase inhibitors including: Neu5Ac, Neu5Ac2en, 4-amino-Neu5Ac2en, zanamivir, Neu5Ac2en carboxamides, and oseltamivir carboxylate.This finding supports the rule that the more a drug similarly resembles the natural substrates/ligands, the more effectively they will be able to suppress a drug-resistant virus. A minimal decrease of inhibitory activity toward the mutant and biological activity of the mutant is required in order to suppress a drug-resistant virus. The drug-resistant virus must preserve its binding ability in order to process the natural substrates or the drug that resembles the substrates.

Even though these in-vitro experiments are useful and educational, drug therapy on infected patients can prove to be quite different from these studies. The different dosages and methods of intake can result in different levels of drug at the site of the infection. A good example of this is the comparison of zanamivir and oseltamivir.

==Bacteriophage==

Bacteriophages are viruses that infect the bacteria. A good example is the bacteriophage T2, which infects Escherichia coli. The T2 and T4 bacteriophages have a capsid with a needle like tail that can insert their own genome into the host cell, where it can instruct the reproduction progeny virions. The newly formed virions can then escape the host cell through a common phenomenon known as lysis. The location where the lysis occurred can be conspicuously observed through the formation of plaques, a clear spot surrounded by a plethora of bacterial cells. Plaques form by a single phage particle that lyse a host cell which then can infect nearby cells.  

'''Bacteriophage life cycle'''
&lt;br&gt;
To begin its life cycle, the phage must find a host to attach to its surface. Cell surface receptor, a protein found on the surface of the host cell that is specific to the viral component, properly mediates the attachment and contact of the phage to the host. 

The cell surface receptor plays an important role for the host cell, but the virus has mutated and evolved to take advantage these receptors. An example can be seen with the lambda phage. E. Coli has proteins called “lambda receptor proteins,” that allow the bacteria to acquire the sugar maltose for metabolism. However, the lambda phages have specific receptivity to the maltose porins in the outer membrane of E. Coli. Although this is detrimental for the host bacteria, natural selection has kept this porin for metabolic reasons. 

With the insertion of the phage genome into the host cell, it directed the host to produce the progeny phages. Alfred Hershey and Margaret Chase In 1952 experimentally proved this when they have experimentally shown that when they transferred the DNA by a bacteriophage to a host cell, it led to the production of progeny phages. In 1950, Andre Lwoff and Antoinette Gutman observed that the phage genome can be integrated within the genome of the host bacteria. Most bacteriophages only insert their genome into the host through the cell envelope without the need for the whole capsid to penetrate the cell wall. T4 for example exhibit this kind of behavior. This virion has a neck tube that can contract and insert its DNA through the cell surface and into the host cell’s DNA. 

Bacteriophage can go through two main cycles: The Lytic and Lysogeny cycle. 
In a lytic cycle, the phage directs the immediate production of its progeny following the insertion of DNA. The process involves both the replicating the phage genome and the expression of the bacteriophage mRNA for the production of enzymes and capsid proteins. In some phages, like the T4, the host DNA is digested and increase the efficiency and of the bacteriophage production. After a plethora of progeny phage gets created, it proceeds to host cell lyses, which then releases the phages. Lysis is often referred to as a burst and the number of virus progenies released is called the burst size. 
&lt;/br&gt;

In the Lysogenic cycle, the phage inserts the DNA into the host cell but integrates its own genome into that of the host cell. Phage lambda, which has a linear genome of a double stranded DNA, reshapes the DNA to a circular shape upon entry into the host cell. The circular DNA can then integrate into the host genome by site-specific recombination of DNA. In this recombination, the recombinase enzyme aligns the Bacteriophage DNA with the host DNA so that the phosphodiester backbone links can be exchanged, which then leads to the integration. 

The integration allows the phage genome to be replicated along with of the host cell as it replicates. The phage genome in the host DNA is called the prophage. Not only does Lysogeny integrate the phage genome into that of the hosts but also it can spontaneously generate a lytic burst of a phage. The prophage directs is own removal from the host genome by intramolecular process of site specific recombination with the two ends of the phage genome exchanging the phosphodiester backbone linkages once again. While the excised DNA exits the host genome, it circularizes and commences the lytic cycle, thus destroying the host cell and releasing the progeny phage. 

Bateriophage can also go through a less prominent cycle called the Slow release cycle performed by the filamentous phages like the M13 phage. In this particular cycle, the phage particles replicate without the lysis of the host cell. The single stranded circular DNA of M13 serves as a template strand for the synthesis of a double stranded intermediate. Then this intermediate produces singe-stranded progeny genomes that get packaged by coating and supercoiling with the capsid proteins. These progeny phages force out through the host cell envelope without lysing the cell. The host cell continues to reproduce but more slowly because much of the resources are used to the production of the virus. 

Proteins that bind DNA and subdue the transcription for the replication of the virus decide whether to go through the Lysis or Lysogeny. The transition from Lysogeny to Lysis can occur randomly but can also be affected by environmental factors such as UV light, which can damage the cell’s DNA. As for environmental cues, if a host cell’s growth is very strong, it’s more frequent to see the phage DNA inactive while an event that threatens the survival of the cell will initiate the lytic phage.

'''Virus transferring host genes'''
&lt;br&gt;
During the exit from the lysogeny phase, the phage can acquire the host genes and pass it onto another host cell in an event known as Transduction. Sometimes the whole phage genome can be permanently replaced by the host genome and packaged into the capsid, which would only be capable of transferring host DNA.

==Lock and Key Mechanism==
All viruses have a viral capsid. A viral capsid is the coat and the genome. However, only some viruses have envelopes. Envelopes are made up of lipids and they are essentially the same as the plasma membrane of the cell; they are similar because envelopes actually come from the host plasma membrane. Thus, the envelope has host and viral proteins that are gotten by exiting the host: viruses cannot do anything from inside the cell, so they have to get out to infect more cells. They do so by budding off and taking a piece of the host plasma membrane. The goal of a virus is to duplicate its genome and make protein; however, the real goal is to make more viruses, and the virus does so by infecting the host cell and working inside the host cell. First, the virus needs to figure out what sort of cells it can get into. The viral capsid and envelope proteins define the host/virus specificity: in the capsid there are specific proteins that will interact with specific proteins on the host cell membrane. This is the lock and key mechanism, where only certain viruses will recognize certain host cells. The host cell range is the types of cells that viruses can infect, and viruses have a limited host cell range: viruses can infect only specific cells and not all cells in the body, and the host cell range is define by the lock and key mechanism. The virus gets in the host cell by endocytosis (like the endosymbiont hypothesis) or by genome injection where only the genome is injected into the cell (the entire virus does not need to get in the cell since it only really needs the genome in). Both endocytosis and genome injection depend on the lock and key mechanism in order to decide which viruses can get in.

==Lytic Life Cycle==
In this cycle, the virus gets inside the host cell, duplicates its genome, makes protein, and then assembles new viruses by getting together the pieces it just produced. Eventually, the virus will cause the host cell to burst, which means that the lytic life cycle results in cell death and non-enveloped viruses. Everything in this cycle is done as quickly as possible, and the virus then moves on to other cells.

[[File:Viral Replication Cycle.svg|thumb|right|Phage injecting its genome]]

==Lysogenic Life Cycle==
This cycle does not result in any immediate killing of the cell. The virus enters the cell and actually inserts its genome into the host cell's genome. Then, when the host cell genome is duplicated, the viral genome gets duplicated along with it. Then, when something signals the virus to duplicate, the virus enters the lytic life cycle. The lysogenic life cycle includes the lytic life cycle.

==Enveloped Virus==
This type of virus can undergo either the lytic or lysogenic life cycle, but the end is different. After assembling, the viruses start budding out of the cell. They do not immediately kill off the cell but instead they take bits of the host cell plasma membrane. Enveloped viruses therefore contain many similar proteins and lipids to the host cells,  which means that they are difficult to be detected by the immune system. 
Non-enveloped viruses, on the other hand, are easier to spot because they are seen as foreign. Also, some of the viral characteristics make them detectable as foreign: their double stranded RNA (our bodies do not have double stranded RNA) and viral proteins such as RNA replicase and reverse transcriptase (which are also foreign to the cell). Nonetheless, viruses are not as easily detectable as bacteria: while bacteria float around by themselves making them vulnerable to faster detection, viruses hide inside our body cells.

== Genome packaging ==
Viruses use mainly two methods to package their genomes 
*Building a capsid around viral genome
*Building a capsid first, then package genome into capsid; very often require the use of '''motor proteins'''
=== Packaging Initiation ===
Before packaging its own viral genome, there must be a process that can help viruses differentiate their own genome from its host genome; this process is known as '''initiation'''. There are several ways to initiate packaging:

*Unsegmented RNA
**Capsid has a binding site complementary to the specific sequence of the RNA or DNA

*Segmented RNA
**Segments have complementary sequence to other segments
**Capsid has more than one binding sites that recognizes the difference sequences on different segments

*DNA
**Double stranded DNA use a relatively different mechanism.
***Usually replicates their genome as head-to-tail concatemers {{ref|Sun}}
***Uses a two-protein complex called terminase to recognize a specific sequence of concatemers for initiation{{ref|Sun}}.
***After about 1 genome length of DNA, terminase cuts concatemers again to terminate packaging

=== Examples of motor proteins and their mechanisms ===
Different viruses have different types of genomes(dsDNA, dsRNA, ssDNA, ssRNA)and also different motor proteins. Not surprisingly, their packaging mechanisms differ from one another.
 
==== P4 ATPase ====
*Found in dsRNA viruses such as Φ6 and Φ12
*multi-subunit
*Has many other functions besides packaging genomes
P4 ATPase is a hexameric molecule that has a central channel that is lined with loops and helices{{ref|Sun}}. Some of these loops have phosphate-binding sites. ATP will bind to these sites, resulting in a change in conformation within the central channel. This change in conformation is believed to be responsible for RNA translocation. P4 ATPase will remain in the final virion even when packaging is complete.

==== DNA motor proteins ====
*relatively powerful; most powerful known molecular motor is T4
**generates up to 60 picnewtons of force
**packages DNA at 700bp/s
Motor proteins that are used to package DNA genomes have to be more powerful than typical RNA motor proteins because DNA genomes have high density, which causes high pressures in the capsid(60 atm). Unlike P4 ATPase, DNA motor proteins will dissociate after completion of packaging.

==== Rotatory motor mechanism ====
One of the earliest motor protein component that was studied was the gp10 portal protein of Φ29. It was embedded within the capsid and its structure was determined to be similar to a funnal; the smaller end facing out of the capsid while the wider end faced the interior of the capsid. Its central channel was lined with α-helices that had negative charges on them{{ref|Sun}}. This allows for the easy transition of DNA molecules since they are negatively charged themselves. It was predicted that the portal will rotate using energy from ATP hydrolysis, hence transporting DNA into the capsid. Cryo-electron microscopy discovered some structures on the capsid that supported this theory; however florescence spectroscopy experiments did not detect any rotation of the portal. This mechanism was therefore deemed unlikely.

Also, the shotgun method (also known as shotgun cloning) is a method in cloning genomic DNA. It involves taking the DNA to be cloned and cutting it either using a restriction enzyme or randomly using a physical method to smash the DNA into small pieces. These fragments are then taken together and cloned into a vector. The original DNA can be either genomic DNA (whole genome shotgun cloning) or a clone such as a YAC (yeast artificial chromosome) that contains a large piece of genomic DNA needing to be split into fragments.

If the DNA needs to be in a certain cloning vector, but the vector can only carry small amounts of DNA, then the shotgun method can be used. More commonly, the method is used to generate small fragments of DNA for sequencing. DNA sequence can be generated at about 600 bases at a time, so if a DNA fragment of about 1100kb is cloned, then it can be sequenced in two steps, with 600 bases from each end, and a hundred base overlap. The sequencing can always be primed with known sequence from the vector and so any prior knowledge of the sequence that has been cloned is not necessary. This approach of shotgun cloning followed by DNA sequencing from both ends of the vector is called shotgun sequencing.

==HIV(Human immunodeficiency virus)==
The HIV Virus is a kind of retroviridae called lentivirus. It infects vital cells in the human immune system and cause AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) which will reduce the human immune system progressively. The HIV virus is difficult to fend off due to a few of its defense mechanisms including: Carbohydrate masking and the variance of its conformation.The patient will have a high risk of having life-threatening infections and cancers. HIV, just like other kind of Lentivirius, is transmitted as single-stranded, positive sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Unlike other retroviruses, HIV is roughly spherical with a diameter of 120&amp;nbsp;nm. It concedes of two copies of RNA that is positive single-stranded. The RNA is tightly bonded to nucleocapsid protein and the enzymes need for the development of the virus.  There are two types of HIV, 1) HIV-1 and 2) HIV-2. HIV-1 is the majority of the HIV infection in the world since it is toxic and easier to infect other. It causes a progressive decrease of the CD4+T cell count. HIV-2 is infected per exposure. The HIV virus integrated into the host cell and become latent and cannot be detected by the immune system. There are 4 major ways to transfer HIV virus, unsafe sex, contaminated needles, breast milk, and transmission from mother to baby.

Some people, even if exposed to HIV, don’t develop AIDS because scientists discovered that they carried a rare genetic variant, which has slightly different sequence of nucleotides, that protects people from getting AIDS. It is called CCR5. This rare gene is thought to be selected during evolution because it made people resistant to an organism unrelated to HIV.

The time between getting the HIV virus in a human system and actually getting the disease associated with it (AIDS) is a very important factor to look into. During this time period, the human immune system gets progressively weaker, since the immune system is compromised. In fact, some viruses that people come into contact with (even the common cold) actually behave as cofactors to the HIV virus. However, to act as a cofactor, the other virus must have certain characteristics. First off, the other virus should be able to infect the same cells that HIV infects. Secondly, the amount of cells that get infected at the same time must be large enough to change the normal mechanism of the HIV virus. Many viruses have been proposed as cofactors to the HIV virus, but have failed to meet the first criterion listed.

Also, HIV viruses generally like to infect CD4+ T-cells. Many of these cells reside in the lymph nodes, so the HIV virus can also generally be found in the lymph nodes. HIV viruses can generally be found anywhere in the body that CD4+ cells are abundant. This includes places such as the adenoids, macrophages, and tonsils as well. 

Many efforts have been made to create an effective vaccine against the HIV virus. Before being able to create the vaccine, the methods of transmission must be examined. This virus can be transmitted in four different ways. The most obvious of these ways is sexual transmission. The other paths of infection are needle sharing in drug users, mother to baby transmission, and the use of infected blood or products thereof. A good number of vaccines have been proposed for this, and are now in clinical trials. However, there are abundant ethical and social issues regarding the use of such vaccines on human volunteers. One concern is the obvious threat to human lives if the virus in the vaccine concoction gets out of hand. Another safety issue is that producing mass amounts of the retrovirus is hazardous to both the people working in the lab and the general public.

'''HIV Immunity'''

APOBEC is a protein that has been evolutionary conserved and is used in animals for making diverse proteins from mRNA. APOBEC3G is in the same family of conserved proteins, but is solely found in human beings. It is said to have an important job in anti-viral immunity, especially against retroviruses such as HIV, which is currently being studied. This symmetric protein, with 2 homologous catalytic sequences, is known to interfere with the reverse transcription activity of HIV before it can be integrated into the host chromosome. Typically, without APOBEC3G, a tRNA called tRNA3Lys binds to the HIV-1 primer binding site to start the process of reverse transcription. But when APOBEC3G is present, it can stop the primer binding site, which then stops the reverse transcriptase from making the single stranded DNA and eventually double stranded DNA.

However, there is something called the Viral Infectivity Factor (Vif), a protein that is native to the HIV virus, that is being researched because of its counteracting effects to APOBEC3G. Vif is known to attack APOBEC3G and deactivate it.  Going back to how APOBEC3G functions, in the absence of Vif, APOBEC3G can catalyze dC to dU mutations in the reverse strand script, causing multiple copying errors in the daughter script. These are missense and nonsense codons that end up being copied.

It is one of the most useful techniques for protein purification, like HPLC. It provide a full range of chromatography nodes, such as ion exchange, chromatofocusing, gel filtration, hydrophobic interaction, and reverse phase, based on particles with average diameter sizes in the same range as those used for HPLC separations. The advantage of FPLC columns allow much higher protein loadings comparing to HPLC ones with the wide range of aqueous and biocompatible buffer systems. Its use appears in the literature in almost 2000 reports in the two decades due to ints introduction, two of the most popular FPLC modes are ion exchange and gel filtration.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Scientists now have techniques that allow genes and DNA sequences of interest to be stored, through the use of cDNA and phages.  DNA cataloging is a process used for recording and storing specific samples of DNA.  The basic process is to take a sample of DNA, ligate it to a plasmid, inserting the plasmid into a bacteria, selecting for bacteria of interest, and storing the bacteria in a large freezer.

==Sample of DNA==
The sample of DNA is usually synthesized by PCR from a single DNA strand that contains within it three things: the gene of interest, a restriction enzyme binding site on each end, and a &quot;test&quot; gene.
The &quot;test&quot; gene usually codes for a pigment or a pigment inhibitor so later in the process it will be easy to detect which bacterial have the gene of interest.

==Ligation to a Plasmid==
A Plasmid is a circular piece of DNA naturally found in many bacterial cells.  The useful features of plasmids to scientists are that they can be absorbed through the bacterial membrane.  Once absorbed, the bacteria will begin to express the genes on the plasmids.  
To ligate a gene of interest to a plasmid, often an artificially produced plasmid will be used.  This plasmid will have some sort of antibiotic resistance (usually to Ampicillin) and a specific restriction enzyme (the same one used in the DNA amplified through PCR).  when the plasmids and the DNA of interest are mixed, many of the &quot;sticky ends&quot; of the plasmid and the DNA will connect.  DNA ligase and ATP will need to be added to the solution to covalently link the strands to each other.

Unfortunately, sometimes the plasmid can simply reconnect with itself where it was broken, which is why there is a test gene in the DNA sequence of interest.  We will know (later) which plasmids have the gene, and which do not.&lt;ref = &quot;Bacterial Transformation&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Structural_Biochemistry/DNA_recombinant_techniques/DNA_Cataloging&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1], Bacterial Transformation&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insertion of Plasmid to Bacteria==
Once the plasmid is put back together, it can be inserted into a bacteria.  The common method of doing this is through &quot;heat-shock&quot; therapy.  (note: the bacteria must have the capability of surviving the &quot;heat-shock&quot; often labeled as having the &quot;heat-shock&quot; genes)  Heat-Shocking the bacteria is rapidly heating the bacteria up to a temperature higher than the current temperature of the bacteria.  While the mechanism is not clearly understood, the effect is that some of the bacteria will absorb the plasmid into its cytoplasm.

==Selecting for Bacteria of Interest==
Some of the bacteria in the solution will not have taken up the plasmid, even still, some of the bacterial may have take up a plasmid whose &quot;sticky ends&quot; have simply recombined with itself.  The way to determine which bacteria we want and which we do not want is to use the test gene and the antibiotic resistance gene on the ideal plasmid.  The way to do this is to culture the bacteria on an agar petri dish containing the antibiotic, which will kill any bacteria without some form of the plasmid.  Next is to examine which colonies are expressing the &quot;test gene&quot; on the DNA of interest that was ligated to the plasmid.  Whichever colonies live on the antibiotic plant and exhibit the &quot;test gene&quot; are taken and cultured separately in their own agar dish.

==Storing the DNA==
The most common method of storage is to use a large freezer which keeps the bacteria of interest frozen at around minus seventy(70) degrees C.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==History==
First discovered in plants, RNA interference was first observed in experiments conducted by Richard Jorgensen and colleagues in which they were trying to change the aesthetic characteristics of petunias. Their goal was to deepen the purpled colored flowers by introducing a key enzyme for flower pigmentation into petunias of normal violet color. The over expressed gene was expected to result in darker flowers, but instead produced less pigmented white flowers, indicating the activity of chalcone synthase had be substantially decreased. The phenomenon was called co-suppression of gene expression but the overall understanding of interference was still very limited at the time.
Later on, scientists Andrew Fire and Craig Mello conducted a study in which they injected double stranded (dsRNA) into mRNA and found that it mimicked a phenotype very effectively. From their studies it was concluded that RNAi was systemic, heritable and caused a reduction of the target transcript. 

==Process==
[[Image:RNAi.JPG|thumb|right|The mechanism of RNA interference]]
RNA interference is the degradation of mRNA to silence the expression of target genes. The process starts with long double stranded RNA (dsRNA) that are cleaved into small interfering RNA (siRNA). This is achieved by the cleavage of the target transcript complementary to the dsRNA at sizes similar to small interfering RNA. To do this, RNA duplexes can be synthesized to mimic dsRNA products and as a result these short, synthetic strands target corresponding sites of siRNA. Studies on both siRNA and micro-RNA (miRNA) have also observed a pattern of endonucleolytic cleavage which caused dsRNA to convert to siRNA. From these observations of this enzyme was named Dicer and is responsible for generating small RNA.  With the use of ATP the double stranded siRNA is then unwound into two single stranded siRNAs: a passenger strand and a guide strand. The passenger strand is degraded and the guide strand is kept.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_interference&lt;/ref&gt; The siRNAs are then assembled in complexes called RNA-induced silencing complexes(RISCs). The RISCs become activated after the siRNAs inside the complexes unwind. The siRNAs then guide the activated RISCs to the target mRNAs for degradation. These cleaved mRNAs are then left dysfunctional and incompatible with the siRNA.

A very important factor in RNA interference is the activation of the RNA induced silencing complexes (RISCs). As such, several models are used to study the challenges of understanding its function. In experiments, conducted by Liu and colleagues, that a Dicer enzyme, Dicer-2, recruits duplex siRNA to enable RISC activation. The studies also found that the Dicer-2 enzyme is required for efficient RISC activity and RNA interference. 

Another model, the Helicase model, has also been used to understand RISC activation. In this method, the dsRNA is run through a native gel electrophoresis to resolve double-strand and single-strand siRNA which showed that separation of strands required ATP (Nykanen et al.) . The unwinding of the double strand also concludes that the helicases are important factors in RISC activation. Through these studies, RNA helicases have also been found to have important roles in small RNA pathways such as dsRNA processing, mRNA recognition and the release of cleavage products.
The  Slicer model is another for RISC activation where the passenger strand is cleaved into fragments leaving the guide strand to create an activated RISC.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Qinghua. Paroo,Zain. July 2010. “Biochemical Principles of Small RNA Pathways”. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20205586&lt;/ref&gt;

Thought to first be around about a billion years ago. siRNA found to be in humans, plants and single cell organisms. It is believed that these RNAi evolved as a defensive mechanism from viral producing mRNA molecules.

RNAi is now believed to be able to help with the study of tissue regeneration.  Tissue regeneration is not a very well understood topic at this point; however, the idea is to shut down individual genes using RNAi.  By shutting down these genes, scientists expect to understand what genes in amphibians are involved in regenerating tissue when missing limbs are regrown.  Scientists hope that understanding the regeneration processes of amphibians will help them learn how to regenerate human tissue.RNAi is of special interest to those studying tissue regeneration. If harnessed, the regenerative powers of RNAi could potentially be used to cure diseases such as Degenerative Disk Disease, heart valve diseases, and all sorts of autoimmune diseases. It goes without saying that if the secrets of RNAi were to be unlocked, it could be used to regenerate limbs, possibly saving lives and even extending human life.

Because this process reduces the production of a gene's encoded protein, many researchers believe this method can be beneficially taken advantage of for defense against disease by eliminating unwanted viral RNA, as alluded to above. Currently, medical researchers are putting RNAi-based drugs to the test against diseases such as HIV and Herpes.&lt;ref&gt;National Institutes of Health, ''The New Genetics'', 2006, Pgs. 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Ezra Jack Keats ==
:by Sarah Eady

&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;
:Ezra Jack Keats was born Jacob Ezra Katz on March 11, 1916.  He was the youngest child of Polish immigrants and did not change his name until after WWII (1948) when he found it difficult to get a job due to the anti-Semitic feelings.  His older brother William had changed his name three years previously. 

:Ezra Jack Keats' first job was in a comic strip studio where he inked in the background to clean up the pictures.  He was then drafted, and after returning home from war, went abroad to France to study art. Later, he illustrated book jackets including Silas Marner before publishing his first book, The Snowy Day.  He wrote and illustrated The Snowy Day after reminiscing a day of snowball fights with his friends. The character Peter came from photographs he had in his files. While Ezra had needed to travel down South to illustrate books for others, his books were set in the inner city which he was very familiar with, having grown up in Manhattan.  Ezra called Jack as a child, never married or had children, but once told a young girl during an interview, &quot;The characters in my books are my children.&quot;  

:Ezra died of a heart attack May 6, 1983, at New York Hospital.

:A Biography of Ezra Jack Keats [http://www.lib.usm.edu/~degrum/keats/biography.html]

&lt;u&gt;Genres&lt;/u&gt;
:Keats wrote mostly realistic fiction.  Among these are: The Snowy Day, Apt. 3, Pet Show and Maggie and the Pirate.  Most are based on an event Ezra recalled from his childhood.  He also wrote two wordless books.  One of the two, Skates, was very popular in Japan and is often attributed with instigating a fad in rollerskating there.  He also wrote one legend based on an African American ballad.  It is John Henry an American Legend.  

&lt;u&gt;Types of Characters&lt;/u&gt;
:Ezra wrote mainly using minority characters.  Almost all of his characters are children. Mostly, he placed them in the familiar settings of his childhood doing things that children of all races do.  He photographed kids and then drew sketches before painting.

&lt;u&gt;Illustration Styles&lt;/u&gt;
:Not all of Ezra's books have the same style of artwork.  A Snowy Day, a Caldecott Medal book, used collage with pieces of wallpaper cut out to make Peter's pajamas and blanket.  The snowflakes were stamped on by cutting out erasers to look like snowflakes.  He did this because no two snowflakes look alike.  Some other books are watercolor (Maggie and the Pirate), acrylic (Apt. 3), acrylic with collage (Goggles!).  Goggles also featured imitations of the drawings he did on his mother's kitchen table with his brother's homework ink.  His mother was proud of them and refused to have her son scrub them off as his father suggested.  She simply covered the table with the Sabbath cloth and showed off the drawings to her friends when they came over for tea.  Ezra spent a couple of years in Paris studying art and painting in the streets.  He sold several paintings of the scenery there during a time when many young artists were struggling to make ends meet.  He was a very talented artist who stumbled onto a children's literature profession.

:Will Ezra Keats have a U.S. postage stamp?[http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6660189.html]

&lt;u&gt;Writing Style&lt;/u&gt;
When Ezra wrote a picture book, he started with the pictures and added the words later.  He often wrote with a narrator-like style intermixing with first person.  The narrator tells the story background and then the characters speak directly.

&lt;u&gt;Books by Ezra Jack Keats&lt;/u&gt;

:&lt;u&gt;A Snowy Day&lt;/u&gt;
:A Snowy Day is probably the most famous of his books. It is credited with being the first picture book to feature a minority protagonist without being stereotyped.  It features Peter, a young black boy, going out into a snowy day and having fun.  It is written for young children and is a great winter read.  Any child living in locations where snow is prevalent can relate, and any child living where it doesn't will love the possibilities.  While Keats is sometimes criticized for stereotyping Peter's mother, others say that she isn't.  Her body type is similar to that of Keats' mother and her clothing style fits with the time period.  She is such a minor character, that judging her by her personality or statements is impossible.

:Preschool Education Review [http://www.preschooleducation.com/br108.shtml]

:&lt;u&gt;Peter's Chair&lt;/u&gt;
:In this story about a new big brother, Peter sees his father taking all of his old things and painting them pink for the baby!  Peter comes to realize that even though the chair is his, he can't fit in it anymore.  He decides to share with the baby after spending the day being selfish.  This is a story for every soon to be big brother or big sister and every parent expecting a second or third child.  The collage on paint style is very typical of Ezra Jack Keats and the wallpaper samples that were selected are still viable today.  Also featured in this book are Willie, Peter's mom and Peter's dad.  It is a well-written book for young readers without racial stereotypes or an imposition of values. The reader is drawn into Peter's turmoil and left to decide for himself or herself whether Peter's parents are doing the right thing or not.  When Peter decides that they are, the reader is drawn to feel relief that his day will end pleasantly.

:&lt;u&gt;Regards to the Man in the Moon&lt;/u&gt;
:With just two references to Voyager III and an illustration of the twin towers, which could confuse young readers, this is a story of children using their imaginations to have fun. It is worth a minute of explanation.  Louie (from Louie and Louie's Search) is a Hispanic character who leads the pack in opening their minds to new worlds.  The illustrations are a great combination of collage, acrylic ink, and handmade marbled paper.  The scenes in outer space look exactly as a child imagines it would be like, and leaves the reader feeling as if he could float right on out with the characters.

:&lt;u&gt;Goggles!&lt;/u&gt;
:For the most part, the Illustrations in this book are acrylic. If you watch the orange fence in the background, there are copies of the drawings Jack Kats drew on his mother's dining room table with his brother's school ink. The story of Goggles! is set outside in the city.  As the boys play near some piles of old junk, Peter (same character from A Snowy Day), finds some motorcycle goggles.  A chase ensues as the big kids try to take the goggles, but Peter, Archie and Willie (the dog from Whistle for Willie) outsmart the big kids and return to Archie's front porch where they are safe.  The plot is appropriate for the setting and the characters are believable.  It's a story of children at play in a tough neighborhood.

:&lt;u&gt;John Henry An American Legend&lt;/u&gt;
:John Henry is the story of a man who decides to prove that man is better than machine.  With the wording of this legend, based on an African American ballad, the reader will feel the thrill of trying to beat the machine and will feel sadness when John Henry's life ends. Throughout the story the reader will become involved in John's life and feel his strength. In this version of John Henry there are wonderful illustrations, Keats' style will make you feel the characters are actually moving. The coloring and characters are drawn in a realistic style.  When reading this legend, you will feel as though you are part of the era, unsure if man or machine will triumph. 

:&lt;u&gt;Maggie and the Pirate&lt;/u&gt;
:Keats leaves his element of inner city life and sets this story near a swamp.  Maggie's cricket is stolen while she runs an errand for her mother. As she and her friends work to track down the thief, they are separated.  Maggie discovers that the new kid stole her cricket cage because he is jealous that her father loves her enough to make something just for her, while his father spends no time with him at all.  This book is about forgiveness, jealousy and friendship.  Visit the kids' corner in the author's official website to enjoy this book online. [http://www.ezra-jack-keats.org/]

:&lt;u&gt;Skates!&lt;/u&gt;
:In this well done picture book featuring dogs who find roller skates, Keats included some onomatopoeia and a few words, but the story can be read without the words.  Several dogs find some old skates in a trash can and decide to try them out.  They begin a wild adventure of falls, twists, turns and thrill. As the dogs definitely decide to give up learning to skate, they find they don't have time to take the skates off before saving the kitten.  They learn that they shouldn't give up.  So, the saying if at first you don't succeed, try, try again is played out in this book.

&lt;u&gt;Classroom Activities&lt;/u&gt;

:This lesson is intended for second grade and will teach students to identify words from texts that appeal to the senses. (Ohio State Standard, Reading Applications: Literary Text)
:Read Apt. 3 by Ezra Jack Keats aloud to the class, pausing for comprehension questions along the way.  Examples: Page 2 How could the music be different each time Sam hears it?  Students should make references to the player's mood changing like the rain making him feel sad and lonely.  A warm spring day might make the player feel happy and alive. Page 12 Why are Sam and his little brother going door to door, down the hallway?  Students should remember that Sam is trying to find the person playing the harmonica music.
:Tell the students that this book contained some really good describing words and that they are going to do a hunt to find them.  Explain that the ones you want them to look for are words that you use your senses for.  Review that the five senses are seeing, hearing, tasting, touching, and smelling.  List a few examples of each for the students.  Tell them that a good word that describes seeing would be bright or dark.  Ask the students to think of a few words that they would use to describe touching.  Students should list words such as cold, sharp, soft, or rough.  Go through the other senses until the students are able to correctly list words that appeal to the senses.
:Explain to the students that you would like them to hunt down ten or more of these words from the story and sort them onto a provided chart by category.  You should provide a chart with each of the five senses at the top, and lines dividing the senses.  
:Provide a copy of the text for each student or project it onto the board using an Elmo™. Assist the students in locating two or three examples from the text and charting them correctly before turning them loose with a partner or a small group.  For below-level or English Language Learners read through the story again slowly allowing them to make note of the words as you read.

:Students receive 1 point for each word (up to 10) that appeals to the senses.  Students receive 1 point each for sorting the words correctly.  Ten correct words each sorted correctly would be scored as 20/20.  Ten words, nine sorted correctly would be scored as 19/20.  Students are expected to score a minimum of 16/20 to show a mastery.

:For a follow-up lesson, have students use words that appeal to their sense of sight by describing the illustrations in Apt. 3.  Either add them to the chart or make a list together on the board.  To tie this in with a writing lesson, have the students keep the chart in a writing folder and use some of these words or new words that they add to the chart as they write in their journals.

; &lt;u&gt;Using Response Journals and Willems to &quot;Make Connections&quot; In the Classroom&lt;/u&gt;


:There are many ways to use Mo Willems' books while teaching young students. In my kindergarten classroom I introduce his books while teaching the helpful reading strategy: &quot;making connections&quot;. We start the week by looking at Willems first book: ''Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus''. While reading the story aloud, we discuss Willem's writing style as an author. We talk about his ability to draw the audience into the book. The bus driver is asking us, the reader, to watch the bus. The pigeon tries to convince us to let him drive; but he really really wants to! After we finish reading the story, we start talking about pigeons feelings, everyone always telling him &quot;NO&quot;. I then explain we are going to learn a new reading strategy: a &quot;text to self&quot; connection (Kindergarten Ohio Reading Process: Strategies and Comprehension Standard: #6 Compare information in texts using prior knowledge and experience). We are going to make a connection with our character: pigeon. That means we are going to think of a time when we felt the same way as he did, sometime when everybody told us &quot;NO&quot;. At this point students write in their response journal. They write about a time when they really wanted to do something and everyone told them &quot;NO&quot;. What did they want to do and how did they feel when everyone told them no? I then look at the journals and respond to each student. ''(Kindergarten Ohio Writing Process Standard #1: Generate writing ideas through discussions with others. #2: Choose a topic for writing. #3: Determine an audience.) '' 


:Each day we would look at one of Willems books. All of his books are easy for kids to make a &quot;text to self&quot; connection. I find that having students write in a response journal gives each of them a chance to tell their own story. They even get to hear a personal response from the teacher: helping classroom rapport.   


: Each day the student understanding would be assessed by reading response journals. The teacher can determine understanding connections as well as writing on topic for the generated audience (YOU) through each student's writing.

&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;

Author's Homepage [http://denisefleming.com/]

{{BookCat}}

     Denise Fleming was born in Toledo, Ohio on January 30, 1950.  Denise was an only child for five years then came her sister Rochelle.  Her father Frank was a furniture maker and her mother Inez was always active in the local theater.  Denise’s parents always encourage her love to create things.  Fleming participated in art classes starting in third grade. While growing up she had lots of kids to play with in the neighborhood. They all enjoyed playing and sleeping outdoors, riding their bikes, using cardboard boxes to create towns and acting out stories together. She received good grades in school but often teachers complained that she was messy and too talkative. She attended Kendall School of Art and Design in Michigan.  Fleming continues to live in Toledo with her husband David and daughter Indigo and their family dog, as well as, several cats.  She has a passion for nature, the outdoors and animals, which shows in all of her books.  Some of her favorite hobbies are planting gardens for wildlife and building things with her husband.  Her favorite foods are S’mores, tomatoes with basil, corn on the cob and lemonade.  

'''&lt;u&gt;Genres&lt;/u&gt;'''
Most all of Flemings books are realistic fiction.  Her inspiration is often based on her passion for the outdoors. Several of her books are about nature.  She often watches birds, insects and other creatures experience life and then writes about them.  

'''&lt;u&gt;Types of Characters&lt;/u&gt;'''
Fleming writes most of her books around characters that are animals or insects and she places them usually in a nature type setting.  She enjoys telling the story of the creatures she spends hours viewing.

'''&lt;u&gt;Illustrations Style&lt;/u&gt;''' 
Art has always been Fleming’s passion.  Currently, she creates all of her illustrations using a paper making method, which she calls pulp painting.  She admits it is often time consuming and a lot of work but it is almost like a therapy for her.  She enjoys it so much that she would not trade it for the world.  The method requires a mixture of water and brightly-colored but small cotton fibers.  She even uses common items like coffee grounds, pine needles or dried leaves to create different textures.

'''&lt;u&gt;Books by Denise Fleming&lt;/u&gt;'''
	
	'''&lt;u&gt;In the Tall, Tall Grass&lt;/u&gt;'''

	'''&lt;u&gt;Barnyard Banter&lt;/u&gt;'''

Enjoy life on the farm in this easy reader.  Fleming uses rhyming words to show animals in their natural settings.  Kids will love imitating the animal’s sounds throughout the story.  Fleming uses the full page to her advantage to create bold colors along with black typeface to move across the page.

	'''&lt;u&gt;Where Once There Was a Wood&lt;/u&gt;'''
A simple ecology lesson for young readers.  This book shows a wooded area that was once thriving with living creatures.  Along came a housing development that changes how these creatures are used to living.  Fleming uses earth tones with amazing color and textures to show the contrast between the wooded area and the housing development.  A great way to introduce students to the importance of saving areas for animals to live their lives.[http://www.amazon.com/Where-Once-There-Was-Wood/dp/0805037616]



'''	&lt;u&gt;Buster&lt;/u&gt;'''
Buster is happily living his life with owner Brown Shoes.  He has all the things he loves: his own bowl, a big back yard and Brown Shoes always takes him to the park.  However, one day Brown Shoes brings home Betty, a new cat.   Buster is terrified of cats and runs away.  On his adventure he gets lost and can not find his way back home.  You will have to read this story to find out who saves the day.  Fleming uses her pulp painting to create realistic personalities for the characters.  This book is also a good introduction to chapter books for young readers. [http://www.amazon.com/Buster-Denise-Fleming/dp/0805062793]



	'''&lt;u&gt;Buster and the Cowboy Camp&lt;/u&gt;'''

This story is the sequel to Buster.  Brown Shoes is going away for the weekend so he sends his dog Buster to Cowboy Camp.  Experiencing a bit of separation anxiety Buster is excited to find that cowboy camp is actually enjoyable.  Fleming adds a touch of humor with her western touch.  Her famous pulp painting is at its best, showing how Buster is safe and sound until his arrival back home. [http://www.amazon.com/Buster-Goes-Cowboy-Denise-Fleming/dp/0805078924]

&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;
Eric Carle was born in Syracuse, New York, in the year 1929. He later on graduated from the prestigious art school, the Akademie der bildenden Künste. He then moved back to New York and became an art director of an advertising agency thanks to Bill Martin Jr. He asked Carle to illustrate one of his books. The creations of Bill Martin Jr. and Eric Carle became Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What do you see? This book was a big success for younger children. Carle's illustrating are a collage technique, using hand-painted papers, which he cuts and layers to form bright and cheerful images (http://www.eric-carle.com/bio.html).

&lt;u&gt;Types of Characters&lt;/u&gt;
The types of characters that Eric Carle has in his books are all different type of nature insects, for example, The Very Quiet Cricket, The Very Lonely Firefly, etc. 

&lt;u&gt;The Very Quiet Cricket&lt;/u&gt;
For this very quiet cricket he walks along trying to make friends and talk to different insects. One day he finally finds another cricket and they are able to make a beautiful sound together. This book is for younger children that love his amazing illustrations. This book  teaches younger children that it is okay to go through life and be quiet, but sooner or later you will find that someone to make that special noise with. 

&lt;u&gt;The Very Lonely Firefly&lt;/u&gt;
This young children's book was about a firefly that was trying to get through life finding other firefly. Finally, one night after many distractions he found other firefly. My favorite part of this young children's book is the end when the firefly gets to the rest of his friends. Eric Carle makes all the fireflies light up like real firefly's would. Children love that atmosphere of interaction with the book. 

&lt;u&gt;The Very Clumsy Click Beetle&lt;/u&gt;
This children's book was about a young clumsy bettle trying to learn how to flip over and land on his feet. He tried so hard but he didn't know how to do it. Finally after he practiced over and over again he learned to flip over on his feet. This book teaches children not to give up on something that they want. If you work hard at something, you will achieve the goal. 

&lt;u&gt;The Very Busy Spider&lt;/u&gt;
A very busy spider was on a farm trying to build her spider web. All the animals wanted the spider to stop building the web and go with them. But she didn't talk to the animals and kept on building the web. Finally it was done and the spider was very tired and went to bed. This children's book was interesting because you could feel the pictures, the pictures were 3-D in the book.

&lt;u&gt;The Very Hungry Caterpillar&lt;/u&gt;
This book is Eric Carle's most popular book. It is about a caterpillar that goes along and eats many different things during the week. Then the caterpillar doesn't feel good and goes into a cocoon and turns into a very beautiful butterfly! This book is my favorite children's book. 

&lt;u&gt;The Grouchy Ladybug&lt;/u&gt;
The Grouchy Ladybug was about a ladybug that didn't say &quot;Thank you&quot; or &quot;Please&quot;, it wouldn't share, and thought that it was bigger and better than everyone else. The ladybug was always ready to start a fight instead of being polite. This book gets the children to explore different aspects of life and understand that it is not nice to be grouchy and make sure you always say &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot;.

by Patrice Timothy


&lt;u&gt;''About the Author''&lt;/u&gt;

Patricia was born in 1944, in Lansing, Michigan.  Not long after her birth the family moved to Union City, Michigan to live with her grandparents.  It was here that Patricia's grandmother (&quot;Babushka&quot;) told her the many stories about her family.  Patricia struggled as a student and she was not able to read until the age of 14. It was later discovered that Patricia had dyslexia. Despite her obstacles Patricia persevered and obtained a degree in Fine Arts and a PH.D in Art History.  She wrote her first book at the age of 41. Patricia is currently living in Union City, Michigan and has 2 children, Steven and Traci.  She has written 47 books, many of which were written about her Russian and Jewish backgrounds.
Most of Patricia Polacco's books are a combination of historical non-fiction which includes many elements of her family's stories.  Many of the story plots are based on things that really happened in Patricia's life. She is also the illustrator of the books.  Ms. Polacco uses a combination of acrylic paint, pencils and oil pastels.

&quot;My greatest artistic hero is Norman Rockwell.  I don't believe that any living illustrator did not at one time or another scrutinize or emulate his style and vision.&quot; (Patricia Polacco)

'''Pink and Say'''- This ia a moving story about two young boys fighting in the Civil War.  One of which was a white confederate soldier, Pink and the other was a African American confederate soldier, Say. After Pink gets wounded, Say saves his life by bringing him home to mama.  Pink gets well and the boys head back out.  The boys are captured and punished.  Punishment was jail for Pink and death for Say.

Pink and Say is a picture book that really pulls on your heart strings.  The character bonding between the two soldiers shows that they saw each other's sameness in instead of  their differences.  The plot is based on the true story of Sheldon Russell Curtis, Ms. Polacco's great-great grandfather.  The illustrations are a riviting addition to the heart-warming tale.

'''Thank You, Mr. Falkner'''-Trisha struggles with learning to read.  As she watches all of the other students learning to read, she continues to see the connection between the written word and the spoken word.  Although her family supports her, she begins to hate school due to the harassment by other students in the class.  Mr. Falkner not only praises her artistic ability but he also realizes the problems causing Trisha from learning to read.  Mr. Falkner takes the time to help her and she is elated by her success at reading.

This is the true story of Patricia's struggle with dyslexia. The plot is one that many students with reading difficulties can identify with. The theme is that anyone can learn to read if someone just takes the time to lead them.  The illustrations are moving and really show the hurt and despair that Trisha was going through.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Katherine Paterson ==

:by Stephanie Palm


&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Katherine Paterson is a world renown author of more that 30 children's books in over 25 languages.  She was born in China in 1932, where her parents were missionaries.  At age 8, Katherine's family was forced to leave China, because of World War II, and return to the United States where they eventually settled in Winchester, Virginia.  Before she turned 18, Katherine's family had moved over 18 times.

Katherine's childhood dream was to become either a movie star or a missionary.  While attending school she did a lot of acting in the hopes of attaining this dream.  Her first writings were plays that her friends in sixth grade would act out.  Chinese was her first language so reading and writing in English was difficult for Katherine.  This did not stop her and she later attended King College in Bristol, Tennessee, where she studied English and American Literature.

After college, Katherine taught for a year in a rural Virginia school before she went on to graduate school where she studied Bibile and Christian Education.  In 1957 she moved to Japan for 4 years before returning to the United States where she met and married her husband, a Presbyterian pastor in 1962.

Katherine did not really begin writing until 1964 when she was asked to put together some materials for fifth-and sixth-graders at church.  She decided however, that she preferred fiction to nonfiction and thus began her love for writing.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Paterson]Wikipedia


&lt;u&gt;&lt;big&gt;Genres&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

Katherine Paterson is known mostly for her fictional novels which tend to fall into either historical or realistic fiction.  ''Bridge to Terabithia'', ''Flip-Flop Girl'', and ''The Great Gilly Hopkins'' are examples of realistic fiction.  ''Jip, His Story'' and ''Lyddie'' fall in the historical fiction genre.  Katherine works also include short stories and picture books such as ''Angel &amp; the Donkey'', ''The King's Equal'', and ''The Tale of the Mandarin Ducks''.


&lt;u&gt;&lt;big&gt;Characters and Themes&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

The characters Katherine chooses to write about are strong and usually considered outcasts.  In many cases they are female and have gained their strength because of what they have had to persevere as outcasts.  The themes typically center around self-discovery and the realization that their expectations of themselves or others are unrealistic.  Many times we find them setting new goals and beginning new adventures as the books come to a close.


&lt;u&gt;&lt;big&gt;Bridge to Terabithia&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

It is the summer before fifth-grade and Jess Aarons is bound and determined to be the fastest runner.  However his plan is foiled when a quirky and creative girl shows up and wins the race.  Jess a quiet and thoughtful boy who loves to draw eventually becomes friends with his running rival, Leslie Burke.

At first look, it seems like an unlikely friendship.  A wealthy educated girl whose parents encourage self-discovery and a poor boy who has to suppress his love of drawing because his parents do not approve.  But we come to realize they may have more commonalities than differences.  Both come from overbearing families, both are outcasts in their own way, both are creative and both are looking for friendship.

Using their imaginations they create their own perfect world and they call it Terabithia.  Terabithia becomes a place where they can be their true selves and where their friendship truly blossoms.  However, Terabithia also becomes the place of a tragic event that will change the lives of Jess and Leslie forever.

Bridge to Terabithia is a moving story about friendship, self-discovery, imagination, and loss.

Jiro is the thirteen year old son of a puppet maker.  He lives in Osaka, Japan with his mother and father during the time of Feudal Japan.  Food and money are scarce for the poor however the rice merchants have plenty.  For this reason, the puppet theaters still thrive.  The merchants continue to come for entertainment.

On a trip with his father to Hanaza Theater in the city to deliver a puppet, Jiro meets Yoshida, the master puppeteer.  Yoshida is impressed with Jiro and offers him a job at the theater.  Jiro's father declines and they head back to the country where things only worsen.  As an act of sacrifice, Jiro runs away and becomes an apprentice to Yoshida.

While at Hanaza, Jiro becomes great friends with Kinishi who assists him in learning the art of puppeteering.  Meanwhile, Jiro's parents have left town and eventually only his mother returns.  She becomes a night rover, people who riot and demand change because they are starving. There have been rumors of Saburo, a mysterious bandit who steals from the rich and gives to the poor.  Who is this elusive Robinhood?

This book is about family, friendship, loyalty, self-sacrifice, and finding one's passion.  I didn't want to put it down...the climax is unforgettable

Kate DiCamillo currently lives in Minneapolis, MN.  She was born in Philadelphia, PA and moved to Florida when she was 5 years old because of her continuing struggle with pneumonia.

Although she received over 400 letters of rejection, she remained persistent in her writing.  After starting a job for a book warehouse and working on the children's literature floor, she decided to write a children's novel.  It was at the book warehouse where she met a sales representative for Candlewick who offered to take her children's novel manuscript to an editor.  This manuscript became her first novel, ''Because of Winn-Dixie''.    

Today, Kate DiCamillo is the author of 5 young adult novels, 6 early reader chapter books, and 2 picture books.  She has won numerous awards for her books.

Her latest novel, ''The Magician's Elephant'' is currently being adapted into a movie.  

DiCamillo writes two pages a day, five days a week.  DiCamillo views herself as a storyteller and gets her inspiration from the people around her, from reading and from other authors.  Kate DiCamillo states on her website, &quot;Writing is seeing.  It is paying attention.&quot;  She further states, &quot;What stories are hiding behind the faces of the people who you walk past everyday?  What love?  What hopes?  What despair?&quot;

===''&lt;u&gt;Book Reviews&lt;/u&gt;''===

:''Because of Winn-Dixie''

This is a heart warming story about forgiveness, love, tolerance and the healing power of friendships.  The reader will immediately be drawn into this unique group of friends and find of piece of themselves along the way.  10 year old Opal Buloni comes home from the Winn-Dixie supermarket with a stray dog, which she aptly names &quot;Winn-Dixie&quot;.  Opal quickly sees Winn-Dixie needs a home, some love and a sense of belonging; not realizing these are the very same things she herself desires the most.  Opal and her father, who is a preacher, have just moved to Naomi, FL.  They are both struggling in their own way to get over Opal's mother leaving them 7 years before.  Opal has a great need to know something about her mother and wants to feel some kind of connection with her.  

Through Winn-Dixie, Opal finds the courage to ask her father about her mother.  Through Winn-Dixie, Opal forms some unusual frienships within the community including:  Miss Franny, the librarian; Otis, a pet store clerk with a past; and Gloria Dump, a woman also with a past who is nearly blind and relies on her heart to see.  Each of these friendships teach Opal something new about life.  Miss Franny teaches Opal how the sweet and the sad in life are all intertwined.  While, Gloria Dump teaches Opal how to see the world with her heart and teaches her &quot;You can't hold on to something that wants to go&quot;.  Your heart will swell with sadness and happiness as Opal learns to let go and love what she has.

This is a very compelling story that will stay with you long after you put the book down.

:''The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane''

This is a compelling story about loss, hope and the value of love and friendship.  The main character, Edward Tulane, is a china rabbit who leads a spoiled life.  Edward is more concerned about his extensive wardrobe and his looks rather than with Abilene, the 10 year old girl who loves and adores him.  As Edward is on a journey across the ocean with Abilene, he is tossed overboard and lost at sea.  Edward spends 297 days at the bottom of the ocean and it is here where he feels his first emotion:  &quot;He was afraid.&quot;  Edward is rescued from the bottom of the ocean by a fisherman who takes him home to live with him and his wife.  It is here with the fisherman and his wife Edward begins to understand love.  Fate intervenes and Edward is taken from the fisherman and his wife.  Edward's journey then takes him to a garbage heap and on to life on the rails with a hobo named Bull and his dog, Lucy.  It is with Bull and Lucy, Edward truly understands what it means to be a friend and to truly love.  Fate once again plays a part and Edward is cruelly separated from Bull and begins to understand loss.  Edward then finds himself being taken by a boy named Bryce to his sister,Sarah Ruth, who is very sick.  Sarah Ruth soon dies and it is here where Edward truly feels LOSS and cannot bear to go on.  Edward's journey continues through the streets of Memphis and finally to a dollshop where he is found once again by Abilene and her five year old daughter.  

Through every experience on Edward's journey, we see Edward's heart grow and change.  Eventually we stop asking the question whether Edward can love and begin asking if he could possibly bear to give his heart again.  DiCamillo captures your heart as she shows it is better to have loved and lost than never loved at all.  

The sepia-toned drawings by Bagram Ibatoulline add depth and meaning to the story.

Discuss the thoughts, words, and interactions of characters. (Reading Applications:  Literary Text)

&lt;u&gt;Plan:&lt;/u&gt;

(Students will already have read book and had prior class discussions.)

&lt;u&gt;Day 1:&lt;/u&gt;

:1.  Class will summarize ''Because of Winn-Dixie'' in whole group discussion.

:2.  Ask the students to name the characters of the story and record responses on chart paper.

:3.  Introduce character trait - a quality of a person or a character.  Brainstorm as a class examples of different character traits people may have (i.e., honest, leader, dependable, brave, thoughtful, mischievous, creative, compassionate, wise).

:4.  Discuss different ways of characterization authors can use:  physical description, how a character acts, and how other characters react to this character.

:5.  Ask the question:  What are some ways Kate DiCamillo describes the characters in this story so the readers can get to know them?

:6.  Review the beginning of Chapter 4 when Opal asks her father to tell her ten things about her mama, one for each year of her life. (pages 26-29)  Also review Opal's list of 10 things about Winn-Dixie on pages 162-163.  Allow time for discussion of how the lists relate to the different ways of characterization.

:7.  Have students think about a person they know well - parent, brother, sister, best friend, etc.  Have them make a list of ten things they know about this person.  Be specific and creative.  Have them write lists on a piece of paper with two columns.  The left side should be labeled &quot;Trait&quot; and the right side should be labeled &quot;Proof&quot;.  Under the traits column, list the ten traits.  Under the proof column write descriptive and specific events of this this person portrays this trait.  Have a list of 50 or so character traits to pass out to help them get started.

&lt;u&gt;Day 2:&lt;/u&gt; 

:1.  Have students share in groups lists of ten from Day 1.

:2.  Discuss who the students think is the most interesting character in the novel.  Use the chart paper from Day 1 to review list of characters.

:3.  Discuss what each character teaches Opal.

:4.  Have students choose their most interesting character from the novel.  Each student will then create their own lists of ten for that character.

:5.  Have students write lists on a piece of paper with two columns as they did in Day 1.  Again, under the traits column, list the ten character traits.  Under the proof column have the students provide how the character portrays this trait and reference a page #.  Remind students of character traits list passed out on Day 1 if having difficulty coming up with 10 traits.

&lt;u&gt;Assessment:&lt;/u&gt;

Students would receive 2 points for each character trait listed.  They would also receive a total of 3 points for the proof column.  The 3 points would be broken down to 2 points for how the character portrays the trait and 1 point for the referenced page #.  Total possible points:  50.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Solve Equations Using Inverses ==

Oftentimes, the value of a trigonometric function for an angle is known and the value to be found is the measure of the angle.  In order to find the inverse of trigonometric functions, the idea of inverse functions is applied.  

The relation in which all the values of x and y are reversed in the inverse of a function.  y = sinx has an inverse of x = siny.  

When graphed, the inverse x = siny is found to not be a function since it doesn't pass the vertical line test.  Similarly, trigonometric inverses aren't functions either.  

In order to make trigonometric inverses functions, the domain of the original trigonometric function has to be restricted.  These are known as principal values.  Principal values are those values that are in the restricted domains.  In order to differentiate trigonometric functions with restricted domains, capital letters are used.  

'''Principal Values of Sine, Cosine, and Tangent'''

y = Sinx if and only if y = sinx and -pi/2 &lt;u&gt;&lt;&lt;/u&gt; x &lt;u&gt;&lt;&lt;/u&gt; pi/2.

y = Cosx if amd only if y = cosx and 0 &lt;u&gt;&lt;&lt;/u&gt; x &lt;u&gt;&lt;&lt;/u&gt; pi.

y = Tanx if and only if y = tanx and -pi/2 &lt; x &lt; pi/2.

The '''Arcsine function''' is the inverse of the Sine function.  It is symbolized by '''Sin&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;''' or '''Arcsin'''.  These are its characteristics:

1. The set of real numbers from -1 to 1 is its domain.

2. The set of angle measures from -pi/2 &lt;u&gt;&lt;&lt;/u&gt; x &lt;u&gt;&lt;&lt;/u&gt; pi/2 is its range.

3. Sin&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;y = x if and only if Sinx = y.

4. (Sin&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; x Sin)(x) = (Sin x Sin&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)(x) = x

Arccosine and Arctangent functions are similar to the above definition of the Arcsine function.

'''Inverse Sine, Cosine, and Tangent'''

1. The inverse Sine function is y = Sin&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;x or y = Arcsinx given y = Sinx.

2. The inverse Cosine function is y = Cos&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;x or y = Arccosx given y = Cosx.

3. The inverse Tangent function is y = Tan&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;x or y = Arctanx given y = Tanx.

The expressions in rows below are all equivalent.  These can be used to rewrite and/or solve trigonometric equations.

y = Sinx     x = Sin&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;y     x = Arcsiny

y = Cosx     x = Cos&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;y     x = Arccosy

y = Tanx     x = Tan&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;y     x = Arctany

== Example 1 ==
'''Solve an Equation'''

''Solve Sinx = 1/2 by finding the value of x to the nearest degree.''

If Sinx = 1/2, then x is the least value whose sine is 1/2.  So, x = Arcsin(1/2).  Use a calculator to find x.

For a TI-84 Plus Silver Edition:

1. Press 2nd

2. Sin&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

3. 2nd

4. 1/2

5. )

6. Enter

The answer is 30.  So, x = 30 degrees.  

----

The inverse of trigonometric functions is also used in application problems.  

== Example 2 ==

'''Apply an Inverse to Solve a Problem'''

''The ship Vegas sailed West 25 miles before turning south.  When Vegas ran into trouble and radioed for help, the rescue boat found that the fastest way to them covered a distance of 50 miles.  The cosine of the angle that the rescue boat should sail at is 0.5.  Find the angle, to the nearest hundredth of a degree, at which the rescue boat should travel to give Vegas help.''

Cosx = 25/50

Cos&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;(25/50) = Cos&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;(0.5) = 60

60 degrees south of west

== Trigonometric Values ==

The values of trigonometric expressions are also found using a calculator.  

== Example 3 ==

'''Find a Trigonometric Value'''

''Find each value.  Write angle measures in radians.  Round to the nearest hundredth.''

ArcTan(1) 

For TI-84 Plus Silver Edition:

1. 2nd

2. TAN&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

3. 2nd

4. 1

5. ENTER

0.7853981634

So, ArcTan(1) = 0.7853981634

== Motivation ==
Sage lacks a comprehensive documentation for new users. There are publications, technical documentation and small tutorials. They are good, but it is not possible to enhance them easily. This book should focus on simple examples and good introductions to explain various aspects of Sage, the interface and its underlying language Python. Content should be generated in the spirit of open-source by more experienced users for new users. Anybody should be able to enhance this book to accommodate Sage's expanding range of functionality and enable iterative refinement of already existing material.

== About ==
This book is a community project. It is open for anybody interested in creating a book about Sage.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To head to the circuit, you depart directly west from Bukulu hut on a newer trail, which adulates twice prior to finally hiking steeply passed the magical moss- draped Groundsel Gully towards (14,345ft/4,372m) Scott Elliot pass. At the top of the gully is a short, tough ladder at a slightly steep section,http://www.adventureugandasafari.com  which leads you a right hand branch would take you to Elena Hut (14, 700ft/4,430m). This is quite a steep, rocky trail which when wet or icy is dangerously slippery. Ongoing straight, and a few steps underneath the pass there is a sheltered spot for a break, from here there is a second trail to the right to Elena is the Base Camp for hiking. Margherita peak in the Mt. Stanley complex, which need require an another day or two and can only be tried out with ice axe, mountain boots, crampons, ropes and prior arrangements with RMS guides. Over night at Kitandara Lake Hut. F/B.

Begin hiking back to the park head quarters.
Following breakfast, you will perhaps start on very early if you a firm to make it all the way to the Park Headquarters and http://www.gorillas-safaris.com  finish your trek (8 hours). The additional option will be to take a night at the Nyabitaba Hut. F/B.

Begin hiking back and finish your trek by the evening. On when you reach at the Park Office, go to a simple restaurant urbanized by a local ladies group for a beer and a luxurious candlelight meal.http://www.adventureugandasafari.com  Over night at Hotel Margherita. F/B.
Day Nine:
following breakfast, head to Queen Elizabeth National park to final part of your trip with resting at Mweya safari lodge.http://www.adventureugandasafari.com Take an afternoon boat trip and afterwards an evening game drive. Use up the whole evening resting by the swimming pool and dinner and over night at Mweya lodge. F/B.

participate in a morning game drive and afterwards head to Kampala and then catch your flight returning home basing on International departure times.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Wikibooks|R Programming}}

In general terms, [[w:Data Mining|Data Mining]] comprises techniques and algorithms, for determining interesting patterns from large datasets. There are currently hundreds (or even more) algorithms that perform tasks such as frequent pattern mining, clustering, and classification, among others. Understanding how these algorithms work and how to use them effectively is a continuous challenge faced by data mining analysts, researchers, and practitioners, in particular because the algorithm behavior and patterns it provides may change significantly as a function of its parameters.  In practice, most of the data mining literature is too abstract regarding the actual use of the algorithms and parameter tuning is usually a frustrating task. On the other hand, there is a large number of implementations available, such as those in the R project, but their documentation focus mainly on implementation details without providing a good discussion about parameter-related
trade-offs associated with each of them.

This Wikibook aims to fill this gap by integrating three pieces of information for each technique: description and rationale, implementation details, and use cases. The description and rationale of each technique provide the necessary background for understanding the implementation and applying it to real scenarios. The implementation details not only expose the algorithm design, but also explain its parameters, in the light of the rationale provided previously. Finally, the use cases provide an experience of the algorithms use on synthetic and real datasets.

The choice of the R project as the computational platform associated with this Wikibook stems from its popularity (and thus critical mass), ease of programming, good performance, and an increasing use in several fields, such as bioinformatics and finances, among others.

If you want to learn how to program in the R language, read the book [[R Programming]].

== Introduction ==

Sage is based on [[Python]]. With some exceptions, all commands are regular Python syntax. 

=== Very simple calculation ===

* Numbers
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
 &gt; sage: 1+1
 &gt; 2
&lt;/source&gt;

* Symbolic expression
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
 &gt; sage: sqrt(2)
 &gt; sqrt(2)
&lt;/source&gt;

* Evaluate a symbolic expression
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
 &gt; sage: sqrt(2).n(digits=100)
 &gt; 1.414213562373095048801688724209698078569671875376948073176679737990732478462107038850387534327641573
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Arrays ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
 &gt; sage: a = [1,2,3]
 &gt; sage: sum(a)
 &gt; 6
&lt;/source&gt;

      <comment>/* Example of JSON API */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to send an e-mail message from within an XQuery.  This frequently done when a report has finished running or when a key event such as a task update has been done.

== Method ==
eXist provides a simple interface to e-mail.

== Creating a mail session ==

  let $mail-handle := mail:get-mail-session
  (
    &lt;properties&gt;
      &lt;property name=&quot;mail.smtp.host&quot; value=&quot;smtp.your-domain.com&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;property name=&quot;mail.smtp.port&quot; value=&quot;25&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;property name=&quot;mail.smtp.auth&quot; value=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;property name=&quot;mail.smtp.allow8bitmime&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/properties&gt;
  )

== Format of the send-email function ==

   mail:send-email($email as element()+, $server as xs:string?, $charset as xs:string?) xs:boolean+

where '''$email''' The email message in the following format:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;mail&gt;
   &lt;from/&gt;
   &lt;reply-to/&gt;
   &lt;to/&gt;
   &lt;cc/&gt;
   &lt;bcc/&gt;
   &lt;subject/&gt;
   &lt;message&gt;
     &lt;text/&gt;
     &lt;xhtml/&gt;
   &lt;/message&gt;
   &lt;attachment filename=&quot;&quot; mimetype=&quot;&quot;&gt;xs:base64Binary&lt;/attachment&gt; 
&lt;/mail&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

   '''$server'''	The SMTP server. If empty, then it tries to use the local sendmail program.
   '''$charset'''	The charset value used in the &quot;Content-Type&quot; message header (Defaults to UTF-8)

== Sample Code ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;

(: Demonstrates sending an email through Sendmail from eXist :)

declare namespace mail=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/mail&quot;;

declare variable $message {
  &lt;mail&gt;
    &lt;from&gt;John Doe &amp;lt;sender@domain.com&amp;gt;&lt;/from&gt;
    &lt;to&gt;recipient@otherdomain.com&lt;/to&gt;
    &lt;cc&gt;cc@otherdomain.com&lt;/cc&gt;
    &lt;bcc&gt;bcc@otherdomain.com&lt;/bcc&gt;
    &lt;subject&gt;A new task is waiting your approval&lt;/subject&gt;
    &lt;message&gt;
      &lt;text&gt;A plain ASCII text message can be placed inside the text elements.&lt;/text&gt;
      &lt;xhtml&gt;
           &lt;html&gt;
               &lt;head&gt;
                 &lt;title&gt;HTML in an e-mail in the body of the document.&lt;/title&gt;
               &lt;/head&gt;
               &lt;body&gt;
                  &lt;h1&gt;Testing&lt;/h1&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Test Message 1, 2, 3&lt;/p&gt;
               &lt;/body&gt;
           &lt;/html&gt;
      &lt;/xhtml&gt;
    &lt;/message&gt;
  &lt;/mail&gt;
};

if ( mail:send-email($message, 'mail server', ()) ) then

else
  &lt;h1&gt;Could not Send Message :-(&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Example of JSON API ==
Many e-mail services also provide a JSON API.  For example, Mandrill has an e-mail service that allows you to send your first 12,000 emails per month for free.  After you register for an account they will provide you with an API key.  This API key can be used with the following to send an e-mail message:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;3.0&quot;;

module namespace mandrill=&quot;http://haptixgames.com/nosql-asset/mandrill&quot;;
import module namespace xqjson=&quot;http://xqilla.sourceforge.net/lib/xqjson&quot;;
import module namespace functx = &quot;http://www.functx.com&quot;;
declare namespace httpclient=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/httpclient&quot;;

declare variable $mandrill:message-send := 'https://mandrillapp.com/api/1.0/messages/send.json';

declare function mandrill:send($api-key as xs:string, 
                                $from-email as xs:string, 
                                $from-name as xs:string, 
                                $to-email as xs:string, 
                                $subject as xs:string,
                                $body-text as xs:string)
{

            &lt;pair name=&quot;key&quot;  type=&quot;string&quot;&gt;{$api-key}&lt;/pair&gt;
            &lt;pair name=&quot;message&quot;  type=&quot;object&quot;&gt;
                &lt;pair name=&quot;text&quot;  type=&quot;string&quot;&gt;{$body-text}&lt;/pair&gt;
                &lt;pair name=&quot;subject&quot;  type=&quot;string&quot;&gt;{$subject}&lt;/pair&gt;
                &lt;pair name=&quot;from_email&quot;  type=&quot;string&quot;&gt;{$from-email}&lt;/pair&gt;
                &lt;pair name=&quot;from_name&quot;  type=&quot;string&quot;&gt;{$from-name}&lt;/pair&gt;
                &lt;pair name=&quot;to&quot;  type=&quot;array&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;item type=&quot;object&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;pair name=&quot;email&quot;  type=&quot;string&quot;&gt;{$to-email}&lt;/pair&gt;
                    &lt;/item&gt;
                &lt;/pair&gt;
            &lt;/pair&gt;
         &lt;/json&gt;
    
    let $response := httpclient:post(xs:anyURI($mandrill:message-send), xqjson:serialize-json($email-xml), false(), ())
    
    return
    if($response/@statusCode/string() eq &quot;200&quot;)
    then 
    (
        let $body := xqjson:parse-json(util:base64-decode($response/httpclient:body/text()))
        
        return
        if($body/item/pair[@name/string() eq 'status']/text() eq 'sent')
        then true()
        else false()
    )
    else false()
};
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
This chapter presents the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique as well as its use in R project for statistical computing. First we will introduce the technique and its algorithm, second we will show how PCA was implemented in the R language and how to use it. Finally, we will present an example of an application of the technique in a data mining scenario. In the end of the chapter you will find references for further information.

== Principal Component Analysis == 

PCA is a dimensionality reduction method in which a covariance analysis between factors takes place. The original data is remapped into a new coordinate system based on the variance within the data. PCA applies a mathematical procedure for transforming a number of (possibly) correlated variables into a (smaller) number of uncorrelated variables called principal components. The first principal component accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible, and each succeeding component accounts for as much of the remaining variability as possible.

PCA is useful when there is data on a large number of variables, and (possibly) there is some redundancy in those variables. In this case, redundancy means that some of the variables are correlated with one another. And because of this redundancy, PCA can be used to reduce the observed variables into a smaller number of principal components that will account for most of the variance in the observed variables.

PCA is recommended as an exploratory tool to uncover unknown trends in the data. The technique has found application in fields such as face recognition and image compression, and is a common technique for finding patterns in data of high dimension.

=== Algorithm ===

The PCA algorithm consists of 5 main steps:

# Subtract the mean: subtract the mean from each of the data dimensions. The mean subtracted is the average across each dimension. This produces a data set whose mean is zero.
# Calculate the covariance matrix:
#; &lt;math&gt;C^{n \times n}=(c_{i,j},c_{i,j} = cov(Dim_{i},Dim_{j}))&lt;/math&gt;
#: where &lt;math&gt;C^{n \times n}&lt;/math&gt; is a matrix which each entry is the result of calculating the covariance between two separate dimensions.
# Calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.
# Choose components and form a feature vector:  once eigenvectors are found from the covariance matrix, the next step is to order them by eigenvalue, highest to lowest. So that the components are sorted in order of significance.  The number of eigenvectors that you choose will be the number of dimensions of the new data set. The objective of this step is construct a feature vector (matrix of vectors).  From the list of eigenvectors take the eigenvectors selected and form a matrix with them in the columns:
#;      FeatureVector = (eig_1, eig_2, ..., eig_n)
# Derive the new data set. Take the transpose of the FeatureVector and multiply it on the left of the original data set, transposed:
#;      FinalData = RowFeatureVector x RowDataAdjusted
#:      where RowFeatureVector is the matrix with the eigenvectors in the columns transposed (the eigenvectors are now in the rows and the most significant are in the top) and RowDataAdjusted is the mean-adjusted data transposed (the data items are in each column, with each row holding a separate dimension).

=== Implementation ===

We choose princomp method from stats package for this tutorial.

* R package: '''stats'''
* Method: '''princomp'''
* Documentation: [http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/princomp.html princomp]

'''princomp''' is a generic method with &quot;'''formula'''&quot; and &quot;'''default'''&quot; methods from stats package which performs a principal components analysis on the given numeric data matrix and returns the results as an object of class '''princomp'''.

'''''Usage''''' 
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
princomp(x, ...)
&lt;/source&gt;
* S3 method for class 'formula:
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
princomp(formula, data = NULL, subset, na.action, ...)
&lt;/source&gt;
* Default S3 method:
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
princomp(x, cor = FALSE, scores = TRUE, covmat = NULL, subset = rep(TRUE, nrow(as.matrix(x))), ...)
&lt;/source&gt;
* S3 method for class 'princomp':
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
predict(object, newdata, ...)
&lt;/source&gt;

'''''Arguments'''''

- '''formula''' 	
: a formula with no response variable, referring only to numeric variables.

- '''data''' 	
: an optional data frame containing the variables in the formula '''formula'''. By default the variables are taken from '''environment(formula)'''

- '''subset''' 	
: an optional vector used to select rows (observations) of the data matrix x.

- '''na.action''' 	
: a function which indicates what should happen when the data contain NAs. The default is set by the '''na.action''' setting of options, and is '''na.fail''' if that is unset. The ‘factory-fresh’ default is '''na.omit'''.

- '''x''' 	
: a numeric matrix or data frame which provides the data for the principal components analysis.

- '''cor''' 	
: a logical value indicating whether the calculation should use the correlation matrix or the covariance matrix. (The correlation matrix can only be used if there are no constant variables.)

- '''scores''' 	
: a logical value indicating whether the score on each principal component should be calculated.

- '''covmat''' 
: a covariance matrix, or a covariance list as returned by '''cov.wt''' (and '''cov.mve''' or '''cov.mcd''' from package MASS). If supplied, this is used rather than the covariance matrix of x.

- '''...''' 	
: arguments passed to or from other methods. If x is a formula one might specify '''cor''' or '''scores'''.

- '''object''' 
: Object of class inheriting from &quot;princomp&quot;

- '''newdata''' 	
: An optional data frame or matrix in which to look for variables with which to predict. If omitted, the scores are used. If the original fit used a formula or a data frame or a matrix with column names, newdata must contain columns with the same names. Otherwise it must contain the same number of columns, to be used in the same order.

'''''Value'''''

The '''princomp''' method returns a list with class &quot;'''princomp'''&quot; containing the following components:

- '''sdev''' 	
: a formula with no response variable, referring only to numeric variables.

- '''loadings''' 	
: the matrix of variable loadings (i.e., a matrix whose columns contain the eigenvectors).

- '''center''' 	
: the means that were subtracted.

- '''scale''' 	
: the scalings applied to each variable.

- '''n.obs''' 	
: the number of observations.

- '''scores''' 	
: if scores = TRUE, the scores of the supplied data on the principal components. These are non-null only if x was supplied, and if covmat was also supplied if it was a covariance list. For the formula method, napredict() is applied to handle the treatment of values omitted by the na.action.

- '''call''' 	
: the matched call.

- '''na.action'''   
:	if relevant.

=== Visualization ===

The print method for these objects prints the results in a nice format and the plot method produces a screen plot. There is also a biplot method.

Examples

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
require(graphics)

summary(pc.cr &lt;- princomp(USArrests, cor = TRUE))
loadings(pc.cr)
plot(pc.cr)
biplot(pc.cr)

&lt;/source&gt;

== Case Study ==
To illustrate the PCA technique for dimensionality reduction, a simple case study will be shown.

=== Scenario ===
In the field of information retrieval (IR), queries and documents can be represented in a vector space.
Generally, several features are used to describe a document retrieved by a query such as TF-IDF and PageRank measures.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Occasionally, it can be necessary to visualize documents in a 2-dimensional space. To do this, PCA could be used.

=== Dataset ===
More recently, Microsoft released the LETOR benchmark data sets for research on LEarning TO Rank, which contains standard features, relevance judgments, data partitioning, evaluation tools, and several baselines. LETOR contains several datasets for ranking settings derived from the two query sets and the Gov2 web page collection. The 5-fold cross validation strategy is adopted and the 5-fold partitions are included in the package. In each fold, there are three subsets for learning: training set, validation set and testing set. The datasets can be downloaded from [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/beijing/projects/letor/ LETOR site].
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A typical document in a LETOR dataset is described as follows:
&lt;pre&gt;
0 qid:1 1:1.000000 2:1.000000 3:0.833333 4:0.871264 5:0 6:0 7:0 8:0.941842 9:1.000000 10:1.000000 
11:1.000000 12:1.000000 13:1.000000 14:1.000000 15:1.000000 16:1.000000 17:1.000000 18:0.719697 19:0.729351 20:0 
21:0 22:0 23:0.811565 24:1.000000 25:0.972730 26:1.000000 27:1.000000 28:0.922374 29:0.946654 30:0.938888 
31:1.000000 32:1.000000 33:0.711276 34:0.722202 35:0 36:0 37:0 38:0.798002 39:1.000000 40:1.000000 
41:1.000000 42:1.000000 43:0.959134 44:0.963919 45:0.971425 #docid = 244338
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Execution ===
LETOR files can not be imported 'as is', but using the following script, it is possible to convert LETOR format to other accepted by R, as can be seen below:

&lt;pre&gt;
cat train.txt | grep &quot;qid:1 &quot; | gawk '{ printf(&quot;doc_&quot;$50); for (i=3;i&lt;=47;i++) { split($i,a,&quot;:&quot;); printf(&quot;, &quot;a[2]); } printf(&quot;\n&quot;); }' &gt; letor.data
&lt;/pre&gt;

After that, 'letor.data' will be seen as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
doc_244338, 1.000000, 1.000000, 0.833333, 0.871264, 0, 0, 0, 0.941842, 1.000000, 1.000000, 
1.000000, 1.000000, 1.000000, 1.000000, 1.000000, 1.000000, 1.000000, 0.719697, 0.729351, 
0, 0, 0, 0.811565, 1.000000, 0.972730, 1.000000, 1.000000, 0.922374, 0.946654, 0.938888, 
1.000000, 1.000000, 0.711276, 0.722202, 0, 0, 0, 0.798002, 1.000000, 1.000000, 1.000000, 
1.000000, 0.959134, 0.963919, 0.971425
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now, it is possible to load 'letor.data' file to R and run PCA to plot documents in a 2-dimensional space, as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
data=read.table(&quot;letor.data&quot;,sep=&quot;,&quot;)
summary(pc.cr &lt;- princomp(data[,2:46]))
loadings(pc.cr)

library(lattice)
pc.cr$scores
pca.plot &lt;- xyplot(pc.cr$scores[,2] ~ pc.cr$scores[,1])
pca.plot$xlab &lt;- &quot;First Component&quot;
pca.plot$ylab &lt;- &quot;Second Component&quot;
pca.plot
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Results ===
The script above generates the following chart:

[[File:Pca_plot.jpg]]

=== Analysis ===
As we can see, despite documents being represented by multiple features (&gt;45), PCA was able to find 2 '''principal components''' that were used to plot all documents in a 2-dimensional chart.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Frequent Sequence Mining is used to discover a set of patterns shared among objects which have between them a specific order. For instance, a retail shop may possess a transaction database which specifies which products were acquired by each customer over time. In this case, the store may use Frequent Sequence Mining to find that 40% of the people who bought the first volume of Lord of the Rings came back to buy the second volume a month later. This kind of information may be used to support directed advertising campaigns or recommendation systems.

Another application domain where Frequent Sequence Mining may be used is Web click log analysis in Information Retrieval systems, in which case the system performance may be refined by analyzing the sequence of interactions that the user exposed while searching or browsing for a specific information. This kind of usage becomes especially clear when we consider the huge amount of data obtained by industrial search engines in the form of query logs. Google alone was reported to answer 5.42 billion queries during December 2008 (Telecom Paper, 2009)

In biology Frequent Sequence Mining may be used to extract information hidden in DNA sequences. Sequence databases in biology are often huge and complex due to variations from genetic mutations and evolution (Li et al., 2007). For example, Frequent Sequence Mining can be used to extract patterns which may be determinant to the development of genetic conditions.

A sequence α is an ordered list of events &lt;a1,a2,...,am&gt;. An event is a non-empty unordered set of items ai ⊆ i1,i2,...,ik. A sequence α = &lt;a1,a2,...,am&gt; is a subsequence of β = &lt; b1, b2,...,bn &gt; if and only if exists i1,i2,...,im such that 1 ≤ i1 &lt; i2 &lt; ... &lt; im ≤ n and a1 ⊆ bi1, a2 ⊆ bi2 and am ⊆ bim. Given a sequence database D = s1,s2,...,sn, the support of a sequence α is the number of sequences of D which contains α as a subsequence. If the support of α is bigger than a threshold maxsup, then α is a frequent sequence (Peng and Liao, 2009).

== Algorithm ==

An algorithm to Frequent Sequence Mining is the SPADE (Sequential PAttern Discovery using Equivalence classes) algorithm. It uses a vertical id-list database format, where we associate to each sequence a list of objects in which it occurs. Then, frequent sequences can be found efficiently using intersections on id-lists. The method also reduces the number of databases scans, and therefore also reduces the execution time.

The first step of SPADE is to compute the frequencies of 1-sequences, which are sequences with only one item. This is done in a single database scan. The second step consists of counting 2-sequences. This is done by transforming the vertical representation into an horizontal representation in memory, and counting the number of sequences for each pair of items using a bidimensional matrix. Therefore, this step can also be executed in only one scan.

Subsequent n-sequences can than be formed by joining (n-1)-sequences using their id-lists. The size of the id-lists is the number of sequences in which an item appears. If this number is greater than minsup, the sequence is a frequent one. The algorithm stops when no frequent sequences can be found anymore. The algorithm can use a breadth-first or a depth-first search method for finding new sequences (Zaki, 2001)

== Implementation ==

The first step is to install the arulesSequences package (Buchta and Hahsler, 2010). 

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; install.packages(&quot;arules&quot;)
&gt; install.packages(&quot;arulesSequences&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

To illustrate the use of CSPADE, we are going to use an example file that can be found inside the package arulesSequence. This file is listed bellow:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ cat /usr/local/lib/R/site-library/arulesSequences/misc/zaki.txt
1 10 2 C D
1 15 3 A B C
1 20 3 A B F
1 25 4 A C D F
2 15 3 A B F
2 20 1 E
3 10 3 A B F
4 10 3 D G H
4 20 2 B F
4 25 3 A G H
&lt;/pre&gt;

Each line in the zaki.txt file is an event. The first column is the sequence id, that is, the sequence to which this event belongs. The second column is the event timestamp, which is the moment in time when the event has occurred. The third column is the number n of items in the event, and it is followed by n additional columns, one for each item.

First, we need to load the necessary packages:

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; library(Matrix)
&gt; library(arules)
&gt; library(arulesSequences)
&lt;/pre&gt;

To read the zaki.txt file, issue the following commands:

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; x &lt;- read_baskets(con = system.file(&quot;misc&quot;, &quot;zaki.txt&quot;, package = &quot;arulesSequences&quot;), info = c(&quot;sequenceID&quot;,&quot;eventID&quot;,&quot;SIZE&quot;))
&gt; as(x, &quot;data.frame&quot;)

       items sequenceID eventID SIZE
1      {C,D}          1      10    2
2    {A,B,C}          1      15    3
3    {A,B,F}          1      20    3
4  {A,C,D,F}          1      25    4
5    {A,B,F}          2      15    3
6        {E}          2      20    1
7    {A,B,F}          3      10    3
8    {D,G,H}          4      10    3
9      {B,F}          4      20    2
10   {A,G,H}          4      25    3

&lt;/pre&gt;

Next, we execute the CSPADE algorithm:

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; s1 &lt;- cspade(x, parameter = list(support = 0.4), control = list(verbose = TRUE))
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that we executed the cpade algorithm with the data contained in zaki object. We have set the support parameter to 0.4, and also have instructed the algorithm to show a verbose output.

The algorithm output will be the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
preprocessing ... 1 partition(s), 0 MB [0.046s]
mining transactions ... 0 MB [0.022s]
reading sequences ... [0.07s]

total elapsed time: 0.138s
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Visualization ==

We can use the command summary and as to see the results:

&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

This output shows (1) the list of the most frequent isolated items (A,B, ..), (2) the list of the most frequent set of items that occur in events (referred to as elements), (3) the distribution of the sizes of the set of items, (4) the distribution of the number of events in a sequence (referred to as sequence length), (5) the minimum, maximum, mean and median support values, and (6) the set of frequent sequences mined ordered by its support value.

== Case Study ==

=== Scenario ===

In this case study we analyse the application of the CSPADE algorithm to a Tag Recommendation problem. Tags are keywords assigned by users to items in the context of the Web 2.0. A Tag Recommendation System is used to suggest new tags to users with the objective of enhancing their browsing experience and enrich item description. The dataset used in this case study was obtained from Delicious using its public time-line, which shows bookmarks from all the system users during a given period of time. The SPADE algorithms were executed and some results are presented in the discussion bellow.

=== Datasets ===

The dataset used in this case study was collected from Delicious in October 2009. We collected periodically the [http://www.delicious.com Delicious] public time-line which shows the bookmarks from all the system users. Each bookmark consists of a user, the URL which was bookmarked, and a set of tags that user chose to describe the URL.

We show some bookmark examples:
&lt;pre&gt;gmenezes http://www.traderslog.com/forum/ 5 education investment forex CFD trading
gmenezes http://bikebins.com/index.html 6 pannier bike bicycle cycling bikes commuting
osvaldo http://www.noycefdn.org/ecrwresources.php 6 literacy math foundation education webdesign professionaldevelopment
&lt;/pre&gt;

In this example, the user ''gmenezes'' has bookmarked the URL ''http://www.traderslog.com/forum/'' and used 5 tags to describe its content: ''education investment forex CFD trading''.

The public time-line shows the system bookmarks in a time sequence, so that we can obtain sequences of bookmarks for specific users. We can use these sequences as input for the CSPADE algorithm. In this case, each bookmark is an event, and each tag is an item. In other words, we will mine temporal patterns with the objective of generating rules that predict useful tags for a specific user by using the wisdom of crowds.

Before appling the algorithm to the data we had to perform some pre-processing in our raw data. First, we extracted a sample, which consisted of 31,289 sequential bookmarks. Next, we performed data cleansing and duplicate removal. We ended up with 7,559 sequential bookmarks. We grouped each user`s bookmarks as sequences and each individual bookmark as an event. For instance, the example above yields:

&lt;pre&gt;
1 1 5 education investment forex CFD trading
1 2 6 pannier bike bicycle cycling bikes commuting
2 1 6 literacy math foundation education webdesign professionaldevelopment
&lt;/pre&gt;

The dataset used can be downloaded from [http://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~gmenezes/delicious-sequence/delicious-sequence.txt here].


=== Execution ===

We used the dataset described above in the experiments. To execute the algorithm we first execute ''read_baskets()'' to load the dataset file from disk as temporal transaction data. Note that we need to load the required libraries (as above).

&lt;pre&gt;n &lt;- read_baskets(con = system.file(&quot;misc&quot;, &quot;delicious.sequence&quot;, package = &quot;arulesSequences&quot;), info = c(&quot;sequenceID&quot;,&quot;eventID&quot;,&quot;SIZE&quot;))&lt;/pre&gt;

We can see data statistics with the command ''summary()'':
&lt;pre&gt;&gt; summary(n)
transactions as itemMatrix in sparse format with
 7559 rows (elements/itemsets/transactions) and
 7496 columns (items) and a density of 0.0004482878

2          2       1    5
3          3       1    3&lt;/pre&gt;

Next, we execute ''cspade()'' to generate the rules. We have set a support of 0.002 to obtain a larger number of patterns.

&lt;pre&gt;s1 &lt;- cspade(n, parameter = list(support = 0.002), control = list(verbose = TRUE))&lt;/pre&gt;


==== Caveats ====

The use of higher support levels in this dataset does not generate any rule and can cause non-intuitive errors. For example, if the support is set to 0.1, the system outputs:

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; s1 &lt;- cspade(n, parameter = list(support = 0.1), control = list(verbose = TRUE))
parameter specification:
support : 0.1
maxsize :  10
maxlen  :  10

algorithmic control:
bfstype : FALSE
verbose :  TRUE
summary : FALSE

preprocessing ... 1 partition(s), 0.18 MB [0.05s]
mining transactions ... can't open data file: No such file or directory
Error in cspade(n, parameter = list(support = 0.1), control = list(verbose = TRUE)) : 
  system invocation failed
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Output === 

We can see the generated rules by issuing the command ''as()''.

=== Analysis ===

We have observed that CSPADE found many trivial sequences from user behaviour. For example, it has found many unitary sequences, such as  &lt;{design}&gt;, &lt;{ajax}&gt;, &lt;{css}&gt;, among others. These unitary sequences are really frequently used, but they may not be useful in the particular application, which is Tag Recommendation.

Furthermore, other trivial sequences were found, such as &lt;{design}.{design}&gt; and &lt;{webdesign},{design}&gt;. These sequences indicates that the same users tend to bookmarks pages in the same subject subsequently. However, some interesting patters were also found. We can cite &lt;{library},{books}&gt;, &lt;{javascript},{ajax}&gt; and &lt;{video},{youtube}&gt;.

We can also observe that many frequent patterns are related to ''design'', ''art'' and ''web_development''. These tags are also the most popular tags in the whole Delicious system, as can be seen [http://delicious.com/tag here].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

This chapter introduces the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm for classification. kNN, originally proposed by Fix and Hodges {{ref|knn}} is a very simple 'instance-based' learning algorithm. Despite its simplicity, it can offer very good performance on some problems. We present a high level overview of the algorithm, explaining the relevant parameters and implementation choices, followed by a step by step case study.

== k-Nearest Neighbors ==
The kNN algorithm, like other instance-based algorithms, is unusual from a classification perspective in its lack of explicit model training. While a training dataset is required, it is used solely to populate a sample of the search space with instances whose class is known. No actual model or learning is performed during this phase; for this reason, these algorithms are also known as lazy learning algorithms. Different distance metrics can be used, depending on the nature of the data. Euclidean distance is typical for continuous variables, but other metrics can be used for categorical data. Specialized metrics are often useful for specific problems, such as text classification. When an instance whose class is unknown is presented for evaluation, the algorithm computes its k closest neighbors, and the class is assigned by voting among those neighbors. To prevent ties, one typically uses an odd choice of k for binary classification. For multiple classes, one can use plurality voting or majority voting. The latter can sometimes result in no class being assigned to an instance, while the former can result in classifications being made with very low support from the neighborhood. One can also weight each neighbor by an inverse function of its distance to the instance being classified. The main advantages of kNN for classification are:

* Very simple implementation.
* Robust with regard to the search space; for instance, classes don't have to be linearly separable.
* Classifier can be updated online at very little cost as new instances with known classes are presented.
* Few parameters to tune: distance metric and k.

The main disadvantages of the algorithm are:

* Expensive testing of each instance, as we need to compute its distance to all known instances. Specialized algorithms and heuristics exist for specific problems and distance functions, which can mitigate this issue. This is problematic for datasets with a large number of attributes. When the number of instances is much larger than the number of attributes, a R-tree or a kd-tree can be used to store instances, allowing for fast exact neighbor identification.
* Sensitiveness to noisy or irrelevant attributes, which can result in less meaningful distance numbers. Scaling and/or feature selection are typically used in combination with kNN to mitigate this issue.
* Sensitiveness to very unbalanced datasets, where most entities belong to one or a few classes, and infrequent classes are therefore often dominated in most neighborhoods. This can be alleviated through balanced sampling of the more popular classes in the training stage, possibly coupled with ensembles.

=== Algorithm Description ===

The training phase for kNN consists of simply storing all known instances and their class labels. A tabular representation can be used, or a specialized structure such as a kd-tree. If we want to tune the value of 'k' and/or perform feature selection, n-fold cross-validation can be used on the training dataset. The testing phase for a new instance 't', given a known set 'I' is as follows:

# Compute the distance between 't' and each instance in 'I'
# Sort the distances in increasing numerical order and pick the first 'k' elements
# Compute and return the most frequent class in the 'k' nearest neighbors, optionally weighting each instance's class by the inverse of its distance to 't'

=== Available Implementations ===

There are at least three implementations of kNN classification for R, all available on [http://cran.r-project.org CRAN]:

* [http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/class/html/knn.html knn]
* [http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kknn/ kknn]
* [http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RWeka/ RWeka], which is a bridge to the popular WEKA {{ref|Weka}} machine and datamining toolkit, and provides a kNN implementation as well as dozens of algorithms for classification, clustering, regression, and data engineering.

We choose RWeka for this tutorial, as it provides a lot more than simply kNN classification, and the sample session shown below can be used to generate other classifiers with little modification.

=== Installing and Running RWeka ===

RWeka is a CRAN package, so it can be installed from within R:

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; install.packages(&quot;RWeka&quot;, dependencies = TRUE)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Most R graphical user interfaces also provide package management through their UIs. Once installed, RWeka can be loaded in as a library:

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; library(RWeka)
&lt;/pre&gt;

It comes with several well-known datasets, which can be loaded in as ARFF files (Weka's default file format). We now load a sample dataset, the famous Iris dataset {{ref|Fisher}}, and learn a kNN classifier for it, using default parameters:

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; iris &lt;- read.arff(system.file(&quot;arff&quot;, &quot;iris.arff&quot;, package = &quot;RWeka&quot;))
&gt; classifier &lt;- IBk(class ~., data = iris)
&gt; summary(classifier)

=== Summary ===

Correctly Classified Instances         150              100      %
Incorrectly Classified Instances         0                0      %
Kappa statistic                          1     
Mean absolute error                      0.0085
Root mean squared error                  0.0091
Relative absolute error                  1.9219 %
Root relative squared error              1.9335 %
Total Number of Instances              150     

=== Confusion Matrix ===

  a  b  c   &lt;-- classified as
 50  0  0 |  a = Iris-setosa
  0 50  0 |  b = Iris-versicolor
  0  0 50 |  c = Iris-virginica
&lt;/pre&gt;

While in the above session we have only used default parameters, RWeka allows us to customize the KNN classifier in several ways, aside from setting the value of k:

* We can weight neighbors by the inverse of their distance to the target instance, or by 1 - distance.
* We can use leave-one-out cross-validation to choose the optimal value for k in the training data.
* We can use a sliding window of training instances, so once the classifier knows about W instances, older instances are dropped as new ones are added.
* We can customize the way the algorithm stores the known instances, which allows us to use kd-trees and similar data structures for faster neighbor search in large datasets.

== Case Study ==

We will now perform a more detailed exploration of the Iris dataset, using cross-validation for real test statistics, and also performing some parameter tuning.

=== Dataset ===

The Iris dataset contains 150 instances, corresponding to three equally-frequent species of iris plant (Iris setosa, Iris versicolour, and Iris virginica). An Iris versicolor is shown below, courtesy of Wikimedia Commons.

[[Image:Iris_versicolor_3.jpg|thumb|center|180px|Iris versicolor]]

Each instance contains four attributes:sepal length in cm, sepal width in cm, petal length in cm, and petal width in cm. The next picture shows each attribute plotted against the others, with the different classes in color.

[[Image:Anderson%27s_Iris_data_set.png|thumb|center|180px|Plotting the Iris attributes]]

=== Execution and Results ===

We will generate a kNN classifier, but we'll let RWeka automatically find the best value for k, between 1 and 20. We'll also use 10-fold cross validation to evaluate our classifier:

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; classifier &lt;- IBk(class ~ ., data = iris, 
                    control = Weka_control(K = 20, X = TRUE))
&gt; evaluate_Weka_classifier(classifier, numFolds = 10)
=== 10 Fold Cross Validation ===

=== Summary ===

Correctly Classified Instances         142               94.6667 %
Incorrectly Classified Instances         8                5.3333 %
Kappa statistic                          0.92  
Mean absolute error                      0.041 
Root mean squared error                  0.1414
Relative absolute error                  9.2339 %
Root relative squared error             29.9987 %
Total Number of Instances              150     

=== Confusion Matrix ===

  a  b  c   &lt;-- classified as
 50  0  0 |  a = Iris-setosa
  0 46  4 |  b = Iris-versicolor
  0  4 46 |  c = Iris-virginica

&gt; classifier
IB1 instance-based classifier
using 6 nearest neighbour(s) for classification
&lt;/pre&gt;

As cross-validation generates random partitions of the dataset, your results may vary. Typically, however, the model will make fewer than 10 mistakes.

=== Analysis ===

This simple case study shows that a kNN classifier makes few mistakes in a dataset that, although simple, is not linearly separable, as shown in the scatterplots and by a look at the confusion matrix, where all misclassifications are between Iris Versicolor and Iris Virginica instances. The case study also shows how RWeka makes it trivially easy to learn classifiers (and predictors, and clustering models as well), and to experiment with their parameters. In this classic dataset, a kNN classifier makes very few mistakes.

&lt;font size=3&gt;
:Once a French colony, the country gained its independence in 1959 and adopted the name Congo Republic. In 1969 the name was changed to Peoples Republic of Congo. The first meter was installed in 1959. For issues before 1959 see FRENCH EQUATORIAL AFRICA.
:The stamps are grouped according to political status:
:: '''A''' - Congo Republic, inscribed “REPUBLIQUE DU CONGO)”
:: '''B''' - Peoples Republic, inscribed “REPUBLIQUE Plaire DU CONGO” or “REP. POP. DU CONGO”
:'''NOTE''': Meter stamps of the Peoples Republic of Congo can easily be confused with those of the Democratic Republic of Congo (previously Zaire) which is an entirely separate nation. The Peoples Republic of Congo is a former French colony, and the Democratic Republic of Congo is a former Belgian colony. Franks that contain “Congo” alone, “Republique Democratique Congo” or “RDC” are from the Democratic Republic of Congo.&lt;/font&gt;

== Motto ==
I truly believe that you got it right. With the increasing level of complexity/abstraction everything today has, some of the basic knowledge is being lost and requiring people to become increasingly specialized and indeed dumb.  Since without a good foundation all higher knowledge can't be fully effective or completely understood.  Leading to an increasingly spread of the application of the [[w:Cargo cult|cargo cult]] mentality to science, people do as they were said it had to be done not as they think is best, this also reduces the ability for critical analysis.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:54, 3 December 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">May I make two suggestions? Firstly, I thought that the proportionality of force to mass and acceleration was the essence of Newton's Second Law. If that is the case, shouldn't it be incorporated in the italicised text? Secondly, shouldn't the statement of Newton's Law of Gravitation be generalised to refer to any two objects, without the Earth having to be one of them?

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Croatia=

:&lt;font size=3&gt;During the Italian and German occupation from 1941 to 1944, Croatia was called the Independent State of Croatia and issued its own meter stamp designs. In 1991 Croatia achieved independence from Yugoslavia and again began issuing its own meter stamps. All stamps are inscribed “HRVATSKA”.
:For issues before 1942 and between 1945 and 1992, see Yugoslavia. 
:The stamps are grouped according to period of use and usage:
:: '''A''' - Period of Italian and German occupation during World War Two, called the Independent State of Croatia
:: '''B''' - Period of independence after the break-up of Yugoslavia, 1991 to present
:: '''PO''' - Special stamps generated only by machines in Post Offices&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

 // FAQ:
 //
 // Frage:   Wie übernehme ich dieses Skript?
 //
 // Antwort: Einfach &quot;Quelltext betrachten&quot;, alles markieren und kopieren, und dann in deine eigene
 //          monobook.js (also hierhinein: [[Spezial:Mypage/monobook.js|Benutzer:&lt;DeinName&gt;/monobook.js]]) kopieren.
 //          Am sinnvollsten ist es dabei, wenn du die Originalversion von [[Benutzer:PDD/monobook.js]]
 //          übernimmst, da diese immer auf dem neuesten Stand ist.
 //
 // Frage:   Kann ich dieses Skript einfach so übernehmen, oder muss ich da tausend Sachen ändern?
 //
 // Antwort: Du kannst natürlich alles ändern, aber du musst nicht. Einfach erstmal kopieren, ausprobieren,
 //          und dann so anpassen, dass es deinem Bedarf gerecht wird.
 //
 // Weitere Fragen und Antworten findest du hier: [[Benutzer:PDD/monobook FAQ]]

 // var usersignature = '\~\~\~\~';
 // (Signaturvariante 2: Datum kleiner, kein Zeilenumbruch nach dem Leerzeichen)
 // var usersignature = '&lt;span style=\&quot;white-space:nowrap;\&quot;&gt;-- \~\~\~ &lt;small&gt;\~\~\~\~\~&lt;\/small&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;';
 // (Wiki-Standard-Signatur, bitte das Leerzeichen nach den zwei Strichen beachten)

      <comment>/* Unit by physical quantity described */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">We live in a physical universe, and a complete system of standardised units describing the physical quantities around us is required to allow us to measure and quantify the universe and its contents. Without a standard unit system, trade would be impossible and the sciences would be unable to build on previous results.

This book collates information on the units of measurement in use, defining them and comparing to other units in the same and other systems.

'''What is the difference between matter and radiant energy?'''

The essential distinction between these two forms of mass-energy is that matter moves at a velocity of less than the speed of light, and that radiant energy moves at the speed of light.

==1-2==
'''What is the Einstein relation between mass and energy? Indicate the IS units of the terms in this relation.'''
This is of course the cliched &lt;math&gt;E = mc^2&lt;/math&gt;. In terms of IS units, the equation reads:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{J} = \mathrm{kg} \cdot \left(\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the term &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{J}&lt;/math&gt; (for joules) on the left hand resolves to:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{N} \cdot \mathrm{m} = \mathrm{kg} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}^2} \cdot \mathrm{m} = \mathrm{kg} \cdot \left(\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

As such the units are equal on either side, as required.

==1-3==
'''Approximately how much energy, in IS units, is needed to raise 1 liter (1 kg) of liquid water from 273.15°K to 373.15°K? (See the discussion of the calorie, Section 1-3.)

The answer will have to be written in joules. However, the most convenient unit for the purposes of calculation is the thermochemical calorie, which is equal to 4.184 J. The thermochemical calorie, in turn, is slightly smaller than the 15°C calorie, the unit of energy required to raise the temperature of a gram of water from 14.5 to 15.5°C at standard temperature. Since only an ''approximate'' answer is needed, though, simply bear in mind that the Kelvin and the Celsius scale have the same magnitude. Then the required number of (thermochemical) calories is 100,000 thermochemical calories, or 418,400 joules (418.4 kJ).

==1-4==
'''Verify the following...
''To convert celsius to farenheight we must multiply by 1.8 and addition 32, to convert farenheight to celsius we must substract 32 and then divide by 1.8. ''

==1-5==
'''Mercury freezes at -40°C. What is its freezing point on the Fahrenheit scale?'''

-40°F (the only temperature which is the same on both scales).

==1-6==
'''For each of the following systems systems (''[1]'') state how many phases are present in the system; (''[2]'') state for each phase whether it is a pure substance or a mixture; (''[3]'') give the constituents of the system; (''[4]'') give a set of components for system:'''

#'''A flask containing a saturated aqueous solution of salt and several crystals of salt.'''
##Two.
##The aqueous phase is a mixture, as it contains water ''and'' salt. The solid phase, however, can be considered a pure substance.
##The constituents are the aqueous and solid phases of salt.
##The components are salt and water.
#'''An evacuated, sealed quartz tube of 100-ml volume containing 10 g of pure zinc heated until about one half the zinc is melted.'''
##Disregarding the quartz tube itself, there are two phases present in the system.
##Both phases exist in the form of pure substances.
##The constituents are the liquid and solid phases of zinc.
##There is one component, zinc.
#'''As (''[2]'') , but containing 10 g of a copper-gold alloy instead of 10 g of zinc.'''
##There are two phases in the system (using the same assumption regarding the container as before).
##Both phases are mixtures, specifically, alloys.
##The constituents are the liquid and solid phases of the copper-gold alloy.
##There are two components, copper and gold.

==1-7==
'''What is meant by &quot;intrinsic property&quot; of a substance? Are odor, shape, density, color, weight, taste, luster, area, magnetic susceptibility, and heat capacity intrinsic properties? Which of these are properties that can be quantitatively measured?'''

An intrinsic property of a substance is one which is not significantly affected by the size of any given amount of the substance, or its state of subdivision. In other words, a mountain of pulverized salt (sodium chloride) shares in common with a baseball-sized salt crystal certain invariant, intrinsic properties, such as density and cleavage. The color of a substance is an important physical property. It is interesting to note that the apparent color of a substance depends upon its state of subdivision: the color becomes lighter as large particles are ground up into smaller ones, because the distance through which the light penetrates before it is reflected back from the interfaces (surfaces) becomes less as the particles become smaller.

==SI units==

The base unit of length in the SI system is the '''metre'''. This has had several definitions over time:

;1889
:The [[w:BIPM|International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] defines the metre as the distance between two marks on a platinum-iridium alloy bar (the [[:w:International Prototype Metre|International Prototype Metre]]). This prototype is kept in a vault in Sèvres, near Paris.
;1960
:The 11th [[w:CPGM|General Conference on Weights and Measures]]&lt;ref&gt;
 {{cite book
 | editor = [[:w:CPGM|Conférence Générale des Poids es Mesures]]
 | title = Compte rendu des séances de la 11&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; Conférence générale des Poids es Mesures 
 | year = 1960
 | publisher = Gauthier-Villars
 | location = Paris
 | pages = 85

&lt;/ref&gt; redefines the metre in terms of a specific number of wavelengths of light of a specific frequency in a vacuum. It is defined to be 1&amp;thinsp;650&amp;thinsp;763.7'''3''' wavelengths of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by an electron transitioning between the levels 2p&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; and 5d&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; of the krypton-86 (&lt;sup&gt;86&lt;/sup&gt;Kr) atom in a vacuum. The metre is now defined in terms of reproducible physical effects, rather than a synthetic artifact.

&lt;/ref&gt; redefines the metre in terms of the distance traversed by light (having a universally constant speed in a vacuum) in a specific time. It is defined as the distance traveled by a beam of light in a vacuum in 1/299&amp;thinsp;792&amp;thinsp;45'''8''' [[Units of measurement/Time|second]]. This is the current definition. This has the effect that the speed of light is defined to be exactly 299&amp;thinsp;792&amp;thinsp;45'''8''' m/s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The discoveries that come out of biochemistry research not only leads to a better understanding of cells but also impacts other areas.

==Medicine==
Our bodies are a home to millions of chemical reactions which allow us to be function smoothly and efficiently.  From building more tissue to metabolizing food, our bodies are constantly taking reactants and creating products.  Many diseases can be traced to problems in [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Protein Function|protein function]].  Some are genetic, others simply develop over time.

[[File:Sicklecells.jpg|thumb|left|Sickle cells versus normal cells]]
===Sickle Cell Anemia===
Sickle cell anemia is a genetic disease that is caused by a mutation of one [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acid]]; in the beta chain the glutamate in position 6 is replaced by a [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|valine]].  This leads to the [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] binding in a strand formation that has the shape of a &quot;C&quot; instead of a disk shaped.  This decreases their efficiency to transport oxygen in the body.  They do not move as well in the blood vessels and tend to form clumps.  Sickle cells also tend to die at a more rapid rate that regular blood cells but the bone marrow is not able to compensate quickly enough for the loss.

Sickle cell is a recessive gene meaning that the gene must be inherited from both parents.  But even when a person simply has the trait, they only inherited it from one parent, their blood flow is affected but they do not have the disease.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/Sca/SCA_WhatIs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cystic Fibrosis===
Cystic fibrosis is another another recessive genetic disease caused by a lack of a [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]].  The disease is characterized by excessive excess mucus production, coughing, and frequent chest infections.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis&lt;/ref&gt;  It is caused by the lack of a CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]].  It is an ion channel that is usually found across a cell membranes that produce saliva, mucus, sweat and digestive enzymes.  A cellular signal tells the channel to transport chlorine which regulates the movement of water in tissues or osmosis.  This maintains the fluidity of secretions such as mucus.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFTR_(gene)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmacology==
Pharmacology is the study of the activity of [[Structural Biochemistry/Medicine &amp; Drug Design|drugs]] in the body.  Pharmacologists look at how different [[Structural Biochemistry/Medicine &amp; Drug Design|medicines]] or molecules interact with cells and how the interaction can be manipulated for a desired effect.  The interactions between drugs and the body are simply chemical reactions and understanding them leads to creating better drugs.  Most often medicines are created to interact with  [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzymes]] and one of the challenges of pharmacology is how to make a molecule specific enough to only interact with the needed protein.

How a molecule interactions with a receptor can characterize it as a agonist or antagonist.  When an agonist reaches a receptor it tells the cell to do something creating a cellular reaction.  An antagonist does exactly the opposite; it keeps an action from happening.  Drugs can act as either.  Many drugs are used to control overactive responses such as high blood pressure or an increasing heart rate.

===Importance of Structure===
In order for a [[Structural Biochemistry/Medicine &amp; Drug Design|drug]] to work it must have the correct structure.  Molecules that have very general structures create a wide variety of cellular responses often seen as side effects.  These drugs fit in to many receptors and therefore have many responses.  This also reduces the desired effect of the drug.  Therefore structural biochemistry is crucial for improving drugs.  The more we know about a certain [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]] and its structure, the more specific we can make a drug that will hopefully only interact with that specific protein.

====Examples====
=====Curare=====
Curare is an antagonistic drug that creates muscle paralysis.  It is extracted from plants and has been used by South American indigenous people to poison arrows when hunting animals.  Curare paralysis muscles by blocking chemical signals between nerve cells and muscle cells.  In a normal situation nerve cells put out acetylcholine which is detected by receptors on muscle cells, telling them to contract.  Curare has a very similar chemical structure to acetylcholine and is able to place itself in the muscle receptor keeping acetylcholine from entering the receptor and therefore paralyzing the muscle.
&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curare&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Medicines by Design&lt;/ref&gt;

===MDR Pumps===
MDR pumps are  [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Protein Function|proteins]] that are positioned in the membrane of some cells.  They are often seen as a defense system used by bacteria.  MDR pumps monitor the chemicals that are coming in to the cell and discard any that may endanger the bacteria.  This is a problem for antibiotics that are not able to kill these bacterium.  But this pump is not found on most plant cells.  Plants have many chemical defenses against bacteria and one is the ability to keep bacteria from implanting the MDR pump in them.  Scientists are trying to see if using a chemical from plants with antibiotics will create a stronger medicine against bacteria.

But MDR pumps are also seen in normal cells and can keep drugs from doing what they need to do.  But they also perform important functions like regulating hormones.

[[Image:Mdrpump.jpg‎|‎center|MdR pump]]

====MDR Pumps &amp; Cancer====

MDR pumps are especially tricky when dealing with cancer treatment. In cancer cells, MDR pumps eject chemotherapy treatment molecules, making the toxic therapy much less efficient than desired. The more MDR pumps the cancer cells have, the less effective chemotherapy will be. Chemotherapy is still hard on the patient's own cells, though, especially cells in the body that have few or no MDR pumps: stem cells in bone marrow. Bone marrow toxicity is a major downside/risk with chemotherapy because without MDR ejection systems, bone marrow stem cells are very susceptible to being harmed by the chemotherapy. One possible way of attempting to lessen this effect on stem cells is through [[Structural Biochemistry/DNA recombinant techniques/Gene Therapy|gene therapy]]. The intended outcome of gene therapy in this case would be to introduce the gene that encodes MDR pump formation into the DNA of stem cells in the bone marrow. If incorporated into stem cell DNA, it would allow stem cells in the bone marrow to arm themselves with MDR pumps, and hopefully be better defended against chemotherapy. The gene therapy process is as follows:

1: Stem cells removed from the patient (these cells do not contain MDR pumps)

2: a piece of RNA with the genetic code corresponding to MDR is placed in a retrovirus

3: the retrovirus is introduced into the patient's procured stem cell sample 

4: the retrovirus' RNA is incorporated into the cell

5: with reverse transcriptase, the viral genetic code (which includes the MDR insert) is incorporated into the DNA of the stem cell

6: this cell reproduces, and the code for MDR is passed on to each new stem cell

7: the genetically enhanced stem cells that now contain MDR pumps are re-introduced into the patient's bone marrow, and the number of cells containing MDR will increase as stem cells reproduce, overall increasing the patient's bone marrow's defenses against chemotherapy
&lt;ref&gt;http://web.archive.org/20100604022446/scicom.ucsc.edu/scinotes/9701/full/features/urechis/MDR_Function.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bacteria with Dangerously-Efficient MDR Pumps====

MDR pumps in gram-negative bacteria (which include E. coli),  specifically S. aureus, is very adept at protecting itself from antibacterial soaps and lotions. This can lead to its increased resistance to antibiotics, of course the inefficiency of the antibiotic, and ultimately possible serious infections. 

Another notable bacteria that has dangerously-efficient MDR pumps is P. aeruginosa. This bacteria causes a life-threatening infection called sepsis, and it is so dangerous because it ejects nearly every single substance that attempts cross its membrane.
&lt;ref&gt;http://web.archive.org/20020621032336/scicom.ucsc.edu/scinotes/9701/full/features/urechis/Bacteria.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drug Development==
Many of the basic biochemical concepts underlying pharmacology also apply for drug development.  In the past drug development was called preclinical development for it encompasses everything that happens to a drug before being put in use; discovery, development, and animal testing.  In the past most drugs have been discovered by analyzing old remedies and finding the specific chemical that induces the desired effect.  Today, drug developers try to understand the target entity at a molecular and physiological level and target specific properties.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_discovery&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Research &amp; Discovery Process===
[[File:LONG ROAD TO A NEW DRUG.jpg]]

The development of pharmaceuticals is a process with many stages and overall takes at least 12–15 years, usually longer. During the discovery stages of drug research, thousands of compounds may be investigated. This is a labor intensive process that involves individual and team research and planning. Most compounds developed do not become clinically tested drugs. There are many things that could lead to the failure of a particular compound:

[[File:Many failures before success.jpg]]

It is not just in the research stage that a potential drug can be rejected. Sometimes even after years of development and progression, a drug can fail in clinical trials or another complication could arise even after much time and money had been invested.

[[File:Time span.jpg]]

During a new drug's early preclinical development, the sponsor's primary goal is to determine if the product is reasonably safe for initial use in humans, and if the compound exhibits pharmacological activity that justifies commercial development. When a product is identified as a viable candidate for further development, the sponsor then focuses on collecting the data and information necessary to establish that the product will not expose humans to unreasonable risks when used in limited, early-stage clinical studies.
At that point, the molecule changes in legal status under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and becomes a new drug subject to specific requirements of the drug regulatory system.
An Investigator IND (investigational new drug) application is submitted by a physician who both initiates and conducts an investigation, and under whose immediate direction the investigational drug is administered or dispensed.

[[File:R&amp;D process overview.jpg]]

For decades, the regulation and control of new drugs in the United States has been based on the New Drug Application (NDA). Since 1938, every new drug has been the subject of an approved NDA before U.S. commercialization.  The NDA application is the vehicle through which drug sponsors formally propose that the FDA approve a new pharmaceutical for sale and marketing in the U.S.  The data gathered during the animal studies and human clinical trials of an Investigational New Drug (IND) become part of the NDA.
The documentation required in an NDA is supposed to tell the drug's whole story, including what happened during the clinical tests, what the ingredients of the drug are, the results of the animal studies, how the drug behaves in the body, and how it is manufactured, processed and packaged. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/NewDrugApplicationNDA/default.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Multidiscipinary.jpg]]

The success of a compound as a final pharmaceutical product is a multidisciplinary effort between many scientists of many different disciplines.

===Examples===
====Taxol====
[[File:Taxol(Paclitaxel)3D.png|right|thumb|The chemical structure of taxol]]
Taxol is a common chemotherapy drug often used for leukemia, and breast, ovarian, brain, and lung tumors.  It has very unique biological interactions. It works by inhibiting mitosis by binding to tubulin.  It attaches to assembled microtubules and prevents it from disassembling and stopping the cells from regenerating.  Other drugs usually kept the tubulin from creating microtubules and while the overall end process is the same, stopping cell division, scientists felt that this may work better in some situations.    In 1971 the molecule was extracted from a pacific yew tree's bark.  The initial testing of the compound made it a very potent cancer drug.  But the bark from one tree produced only enough for one dose of the medicine and the drug was in very short supply.  As a solution a relative of the pacific yew, the common yew was found to contain a compound very similar to taxol.  With a little bit of chemical manipulation the compound can be converted in to taxol.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phcog.org/Taxus/Taxus_Web.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Viagra====
Initially Viagra, or Sildenafil, was looked in to as a high-blood pressure or heart disease medication.  But the medication proved not be effective on either of these conditions and had a side effect of inducing penile erections.  The medication works by releasing nitric oxide which binds to the guanylate cyclase enzyme, which regulates blood flow to the penis.  This leads to increased cGMP levels which leads to increased blood flow.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Forensic Science==
[[File:Gel electrophoresis - 2.jpg|thumb|left|Gel electrophoresis, in this case used to separate different dyes.]]
Forensic science, often called forensics, is the use of many sciences to assist the legal system.  This can range from analyzing skeletal remains to analyzing a piece of DNA, placing some one at the scene of the crime.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic scientists often use a technique called DNA profiling to identify persons of interest.  The scientists create a DNA profile for the person which uses an encrypted number system to express the DNA make-up of the person and can be used to identify a person.  About 99.9% of the human genome is shared by every human.  Therefore a DNA profile does not sequence an entire genome but only sequences the part that is unique to an individual.

The process begins by finding a source for the desired DNA.  The preferred method is through a buccal swab which decreases the chance of contamination but other methods include saliva, hair, or sperm samples from toothbrushes, razors, or samples.  The sample can then analyzed through a variety of different techniques such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Polyermase Chain Reaction|PCR]] which amplifies a specific portion of DNA, [[Structural Biochemistry/Single Molecule DNA Sequencing|single molecule DNA sequencing]] which sequences a DNA strand, or gel electrophoresis.  The sample is then compared against an unknown sample for a match.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Suffocation ==

The patient is usually wholly insensible. The breathing may be very faint or have ceased entirely, the face is often purple and swollen, and the lips livid- Yet all these signs are not always present, especially in cases where the suffocation is due to exposure of gas. 

WHAT TO DO

It is hardly necessary to say — first remove the cause of the suffocation. Take the person out of the water, cut the rope, remove the food item. Even if hours have passed, do not hesitate to act promptly, cases of resuscitation have occurred after the lapse of several hours, not only in apparent drowning, but when suffocation has been due to other causes. For any case of suffocation, proceed as follows: 

Dash cold water into the face, give the patient a sudden slap on the pit of the stomach, and hold ammonia under the nose. If these simple means are not sufficient to restore breathing, try artificial respiration by the following method, known as Sylvester's, and usually regarded as the most successful.

ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION

The chest is first made to expand, causing the air to he taken in just on the principle that a pair of bellows fills with air when opened. Then the chest is made to contract, its capacity for holding air is reduced, and the air is forced out. By causing these two movements to be performed alternately, we have first inspiration and then expiration, the two together constituting respiration or breathing. Wrap the finger in one or two thicknesses of a handkerchief, and wipe out the mouth and back of the throat; then place the patient on his back with the shoulders resting on a roll of clothing, which should raise them sufficiently to let the head fall back and rest on the ground or floor. Then let some one seize the tongue with a dry handkerchief and draw it forward to leave the passage to the windpipe free. If there is no one to perform this office, draw the tongue well out and tie it against the lower teeth, by laying the centre of a dry strip of cloth on the tongue, crossing it under the chin, carryine the ends around the neck and tying them at the side of the throat. Or, if a rubber band is to be had, slip it over the tongue and under the chin.

Next kneel behind the unconscious person, grasp the arms just above the elbows, draw them up over his head, rather quickly, but steadily, until his hands touch the ground or floor above his head. This should be done in the time needed to count one, two. The movement expands the chest and permits the air to enter the lungs. Next lower them so that the elbows will come to the sides, and the hands cross on the pit of the stomach, and press them gently but strongly against the sides and chest. Do this in the time needed to count three, four. The movement forces the air out of the lungs. Continue these two motions—which constitute artificial respiration—very deliberately about twelve or fourteen times a minute. Do not stop until the patient breathes naturally, or until life is undoubtedly extinct.

If the patient makes an effort to breathe, even though only a gaep, wait a moment to see if he will breathe again, if not, renew the artificial respiration, but it should now be timed by his efforts to breathe. Also, when efforts at breathing commence, try putting hartshorn to the nose, dashing cold water on the patient, and slapping.

During the continuance of the movements to produce artificial respiration, the chest may be gently rubbed with warm flannel

Artificial respiration should be kept up for an hour and a half, even if there is no sign of life, or until a physician has pronounced that life is extinct.

Failure to detect any pulse at the wrist, or to distinguish the beating of the heart by inexperienced persons, gives no certain proof of the presence of death.

As soon as natural breathing is established, the patient should be placed in a warm bed, with hot water bottles or hot bricks at each side of the body, between the thighs, under the arm-pits, at the soles of the feet and on the pit of the stomach. Use friction and warmth of all kinds till the vitality is fully restored. As soon as possible—when the patient can swallow—give warm drinks—hot tea or coffee, or whiskey and water, one teaspoonful at a time. If difficulty in breathing obstinately continues, put a large mustard plaster on the chest.

Three gills of vinegar, 4 oz. of ivory black, l oz. of oil of vitriol, l oz. of sperm oil, two table-spoonfuls of treacle, two table-spoonfuls of sugar. Put the oil, ivory black, treacle, and sugar into a bowl together, stir them up well, then add the vinegar. Let it remain two or three days before adding the vitriol; then bottle it, taking care to have the corks well resined. It is best to keep it six months, but it may be used directly.

When the boots or shoes become water-soaked, it is a splendid plan to fill them full of oats or barley, if at hand. The grain rapidly absorbs the moisture and, in expanding, prevents the boot or shoe from shrinking.

      <text xml:space="preserve">How fast is an object moving in a particular direction?  Where will this object be at any time on that one dimensional line (the direction in question)?  Linear motion addresses this question.  

Linear motion deals with the motion or change in position of on object on a line (or in one dimension).  Thus we can represent an objects position with respect to a point on that line with one value.

== An Object's Location ==
If an object is at rest it is, by definition, not changing position.  In this case we can only talk about where this object is in relation to some point.  Since we are merely talking about linear space (that is motion on a line), we can represent this distance or displacement with the value of x.  Let us also use the international units of meters.

If we pick a particular point on a line as the relational point and then place an object directly on that point we can say that that object is at 0 meters, or x=0m.  Let's say this line is a horizontal line and we make the right side of this line be the positive direction and the left side of this line be the negative direction.  If we take this object and move it 1 meter to the right (the positive direction), we can say that the object is at 1 meters, or x=1m.  We can also say that the object change in position (delta x) is 1 meter (1 meter - 0 meter = 1 meter).

'''delta''' means the change in, or the final value minus the initial value.

'''delta x''' means the change in x, or the x(final) - x(initial)

If we take this same object and move it to the left 2 meters we will have

'''delta x''' = (-1 meter) - (1 meter)

or

'''delta x''' = -2 meters

== An Object's Velocity ==

Notice, this object is moving.  That is, it is changing it's position.  Average '''Velocity''' is a measurement of the change in position of an object in a particular direction with respect to the change in time during which the object moved.  For instance, if an objects change in position, that is  delta x, is +2 meters during a 2 second time frame, then the average velocity is 2 meter for every 2 second, or 2m/ 2s, or 1m/ 1s.

'''velocity''' is the motion of an object in a particular direction and is what is called a vector.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Black Powder, Making ==

Under certain circumstances, you may not be able to obtain a supply of this very necessary article. At the same time, it is more than probable that you may have two of the ingredients in the house, and the other (charcoal) you may easily make; and rather than do without you may feel disposed to try your hand at compounding it yourself. I have myself made it without other apparatus than a pestle and mortar, and a sieve; and there can be no reason why any one else should not do the same. The best gunpowder is made of nitre, saltpetre, and charcoal, in the following proportions:

Charcoal, three parts; nitre, seven parts ; and sulphur, two parts.

Powder them separately, and mix them together in a stone mortar; and with a wooden pestle adding gradually a sufficient quantity of water to make a paste. Then grain it by rubbing through a finer or coarser sieve, according to the fineness of the powder you require. Dry the powder by spreading it thinly on tin or earthen plates, exposed to the sun and air, but guarded from the wet; and finish it in a tray, placed over a vessel of boiling water in such a manner that the steam cannot affect it with damp. Gunpowder damaged by wet may be mixed up into a paste and re-grained.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Filter, Drinking Water, Gravel and Charcoal ==

Take an oak cask or barrel that is sound, sweet and clean; bore an inch hole near the bottom of one side, in which insert the end of a piece of three-quarter inch lead pipe (from inside), ten or twelve inches long, the other end projecting inward and bent upward toward the middle of the cask. In the lower end place a common beer faucet or stop cock, from which to draw water as desired.

Have ready say one bushel of good hard wood charcoal, and the same quantity of clean, fine gravel—not limestone—from the fineness of coarse sand, up to the size of peas, and if not clean, wash it till no dirt will appear in the water.

Break the charcoal to the size of walnuts and smaller, then mix it evenly with the gravel. Cover the bottom of the cask three or four inches thick with this mixture, pounding it down firmly. Next take a clean tin vessel, the shape of a garden flower-pot, of large size (say two gallons), and place it bottom upward in the center of the barrel, on top of the layer of gravel and coal, and over the end of the lead pipe. Then take a piece of small sized one-quarter or threeeighth inch lead or wood pipe, and place one end firmly into a hole in the bottom of the vessel, and bring the other end through a hole bored near the top of the barrel, for the purpose of admitting air into the space under the pail. Now fill in the space around and above the tin vessel with the mixture of coal and gravel, pounding it firmly down as you proceed, till the cask is about threefourths full; then place some thin flat stones (not limestones) on top, and the filter is complete.

The water being poured in on top, passes through the gravel and charcoal, by which it is purified, and enters the chamber from which it is drawn by the faucet, as required, the small pipe admitting air into the chamber to supply the place of the water while it is being drawn out.

This filter is only designed for rain or soft water, and will serve for constant use a year or more without renewal; but if used for hard water, the charcoal soon loses its virtue. When first put up, the water drawn from the filter will have an alkaline taste, but that disappears after the filter has been in operation a day or two.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Wall, Stone Rubble ==

In rubble masonry the stones are not dressed. In ordinary rubble masonry, the work is brought up in courses, the depth of which depends to some extent on the thickness of the stone to be procured from the quarry. The stones should be laid in mortar and carefully fitted; face stones must tail in or be bonded into the backing; for rubble walling, as many through stones as possible should be introduced; this also, to some extent, will depend on the materials to be procured. The work should be brought up in courses not exceeding fifteen inches in depth, or thereabouts, well flushed in mortar worked into every crevice until the whole is well filled in. The stones in the face work should be hacked square, and the joints carefully pointed. The backing should consist of flat bedded stones, as large as may be procured; they should be well fitted together, obtaining as much bond as possible, made solid in mortar, and brought up level with every course of face work; no scabbling should be wasted, but they should be packed into the mortar between the vertical joints of the work; this saves mortar and makes better work; the hammer should be freely used, but not so as to risk the breaking of any of the bedded stones. Walls built of rubble two or three feet thick require a good deal of attention in the bringing up, and according to their magnitude a proportional quantity of workmanship and hammer dressing and hacking must be introduced. Rubble takes a good deal of mortar and flushing, and the consequent settlement of the work must be provided for, more particularly where the walls are of any height. Good work may be procured without coursing, if proper attention be paid to the bringing up of the work, but there can be no good work, or anything of the kind without bond, through stones, and fitting the work together. 

Where the rubble is uncoursed, a tolerably level course should be introduced at about every two or three feet, depending a good deal upon the size of the stone used, and the workmanship introduced into the work, and this course should be thoroughly well grouted.

In random rubble, the stones are often used to some extent as blasted from the quarry; where the work is well fitted, when there are sufficient large stones introduced, well filled in with smaller ones, very good work may be produced with sufficient thickness of walling, and the work well filled in; bond is equally attainable here as in the former work, if some attempt be made to obtain it.

Backing may be of rubble stonework or brickwork, and even concrete, when well made and properly used, answers the purpose very well; when made with dry broken bricks instead of gravel, it is very light, at least as compared with ordinary concrete; the backing should be brought up at the same time as the face work, and the whole always bonded in together. The perfect settlement of the interior mass is the more important, since, from the smaller size of the stones and the rougher work, a greater shrinking will here occur than in the face work. Indeed, unless considerable care be exercised in this respect, the defect will eventually occasion the whole superincumbent weight to be thrust on the face work, and thus produce a bulging out, and probably a rupture of the face work. When the interior as well as the exterior face of a wall, or similar construction, is prepared with a fair face either of stone or brickwork, the interior is, for the sake of economy, occasionally filled in with rubble or other rough work, called hearting. Bonding, grouting, levelling, and consolidation are to be rigorously insisted upon in this mode of construction. Otherwise, if the stone facings are allowed to be too thin, too nearly of equal thickness throughout, or not thoroughly tailed into the interior mass, they will act as mere slabs or coatings, and be very liable to separation and rupture. The levelling of each course of face work, must also he particularly attended to; and bond or through stones, fairly and solidly bedded, well fitted, and of sufficient size, must be abundantly provided.

Classify the following statements as hypotheses, theories, laws, or facts:'''&lt;ref&gt;A very interesting relevant discussion takes place here: [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-fact.html http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-fact.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
##'''The interior of the moon consists of granite and similar rocks.'''
##:This can be considered a fact. The Apollo missions brought back hundreds of kilograms of diverse lunar rocks, including some with a composition not unlike granite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/lsc/14321.pdf http://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/lsc/14321.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
##'''Hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon are all gases under ordinary conditions.'''
##:This statement is a conjunction of directly observed experimental facts.
##'''The force ''f'' acting on a body with mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; causes it to be accelerated by the amount ''fm''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.
##:This statement is an inductive generalization over all forces acting on bodies with mass, which have been borne out by many observations from the seventeenth century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/HBASE/newt.html#nt2cn http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/HBASE/newt.html#nt2cn]&lt;/ref&gt; It does not explain ''why'' this happens.
##'''The properties of gases can be explained by considering the motion of molecules comprising them.'''
##:The keyword in this statement is 'explain'. Hypotheses and theories aim to ''explain'' observations, with the distinction being that theories are supported by a large body of empirical evidence. Specifically, the term 'theory' is ostensibly being used in the second sense given in the text, &quot;a systematic body of knowledge, compounded of facts, laws, theories in the limited sense [of a hypothesis borne out], deductive arguments, and so on.&quot; This &quot;systematic body&quot; would encompass areas of physics and chemistry, such as thermodynamics.
##'''All crystals contain atoms or molecules arranged in a regular way.'''
##:On the surface, this statement seems to be a definition, true ''de facto''. However, Pauling appears to imply early on in the chapter that he is referring to the atomic theory of crystals, which explains ''why'' crystals have readily apparent regular, highly ordered structures. (Remember that the distinction between a law and a hypothesis or theory is that a law does not explain the facts it summarizes, while a hypothesis or theory does.)
#'''Discuss some of the evidence for the atomic nature of matter.'''
#:''open-ended''
#'''The metal indium forms tetragonal crystals. The unit of structure is a rectangular parallelepiped, with edges ''a'' = 3.24 Å, ''b'' = 3.24 Å, and ''c'' = 4.94 Å...''' ''TODO''

Problem 3 (as written) appears to have no solution.  The positions of the atoms are given in the problem as 0,0,0, and 1/2, 1/2, 1/2 which implies a body-centered structure.  Indium has a face-centered (not body-centered) tetragonal structure that can be solved.  Each atom then has 4 closest neighbors and 8 more a little farther away.  Do the math.==References==

== Honeybees and our diets ==
When most people think about honeybees and what they contribute to our society, they likely think only of honey.  Honeybees however have a much larger impact in our lives through agriculture.  Not only do they provide pollination to fruit and vegetable crops, but they also pollinate crops we grow and feed to animals which we then eat or use for dairy products.  Without a healthy honeybee population and the beekeepers who keep them, our lives would change dramatically in a very short period of time.  For this reason alone, a great debt is owed to those who keep honeybees, make a living from them, and provide the pollination services required for us to sustain the quality of life we have today.

== Why honeybees are the primary pollination source for our crops ==
There are other bees in nature that can provide pollination for the plants we grow, but they can not supply the sheer volume of pollination required to maintain our current amount of consumption.  This is because there are major differences between how honeybees and other bee species can be managed or kept by humans.  Bumble bees, carpenter bees, and others can and do provide some of the pollination we require, but it is unlikely that they could ever fully replace the current services of the honeybee, and if they could it would be at a much larger cost to agriculture and consumers.

== How pollination works ==
To have a better understanding of the impact honeybees have on the crops we grow and consume, we first need to understand what pollination is, and how the process takes place.  Like us flowers have male and female parts.  The male part is called a stamen and produces pollen (sperm).  The female part is called a pistol.  The top of the pistol is called a stigma. When pollen is transfered to the stigma, fertilization will take place, and seeds will develop at the base of the stigma in the ovule.  Most plants rely on creatures, wind, or water to aid in their pollination.  Of flowering plants, about ninety percent require a insect or animal of some kind to aid in transfer of pollen from the stamen to the pistol.  In order for pollen transfer to happen without wind or water, there has to be a reward for the creature which will perform the job.  If there were not a reward, the creature would ignore the plant and reproduction would no longer take place and extinction would soon follow for many plant species.  For bees this reward is nectar and nutrient rich pollen.  Nectar is basically sugar and water.  There are many different types of sugar, but generally the more sugar content in the liquid the plant provides, the more attention the bees will pay to the plant.  In some plants the bee will unwilling collect pollen on hairs on its body and transfer some to the next plant it visits when it is collecting nectar.  On other plants the bee will intentionally collect pollen for its own consumption and for feeding and raising its brood (young) in the hive.  Just as when collecting nectar, as the bee visits numerous plants collecting pollen, it will transfer some pollen from one plant to the next allowing sexual reproduction to take place between the plants and also increase genetic diversity.

== How man manipulates pollination ==
Pollination is the process mankind manipulates to increase crop yields, and the profit of the crops grown.  Some crops would not be profitable without the help of beekeepers because growers would not be able to produce enough fruit or vegetables per acre to make the crop viable or profitable.  Many crops simply would not be viable at all.  A great example of the relationship man has developed with honeybees is seen in apple orchards in Wisconsin when spring arrives.  Most apple tree flowers in this area bloom in early spring when temperatures are still cool.  Native bumble bees and others will pollinate a small portion of the blossoms but there numbers are very few at this time of year.  Most bee species do not winter above ground.  In most bumblebee species, the queen will hibernate over winter, then she will emerge in spring and start her colony of bees from scratch.  Honeybees winter above ground and will have about ten thousand bees in their colony when temperatures become warm enough to fly, and then will increase their numbers up to 80,000 or more by the peak of summer.  This difference is of great significance to early blooming crops.  Therefore, in order for the apple trees fruit bearing potential to be realized to a profitable degree, colonies of honeybees must be brought to the apple orchards to perform the pollination process.  This example can be repeated in one way or another in many of the fruits and vegetables we eat.

== Indirect effects of honeybee pollination and the food we consume ==
An indirect relationship we owe to food we eat is through the pollination of plants which purpose is to provide seed for crops we grow and then feed to animals we eat or use for dairy products.  One of these seed crops is from the alfalfa plant.  Honeybees are used to increase the production of seed per acre harvested from the alfalfa crops.  Without the aid of honeybees, many more acres would need to be used to provide enough seed to support our consumption and therefore would raise the price of the products that are derived from them at the market place.

== Keeping our food supply sustainable ==
As honeybees play a very important role in our lives and our quality of living, attention must be paid to the fact that beekeepers are finding it more difficult to keep their bees healthy then ever before due to many different circumstances.  Some of these circumstances are controllable and others are not.  It is very important for us to pay attention to the chemicals and pesticides we use in our yards,  and in agriculture.  Too often, we neglect to think of the indirect consequences of our actions.  Unfortunately many cities and towns prohibit even one or two hives of honeybees to be kept.  Large scale beekeepers can find it difficult to find areas to keep their bees because people exhibit ill behavior towards keeping bees anywhere near their homes. The fact is that honeybees will almost never sting people away from their hive.  It is wasps and hornets that are aggressive and seem to sting people for no reason other than they can.  If you see colonies of honeybees in your area, you should not complain but appreciate the fact that someone is willing to keep and care for them, provide the pollination services needed to sustain our standard of living, and that they do all this for very meager or no profits.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Hindi}}
In Hindi the pronouns are inflected depending on the number and case. The pronouns in Hindi may be classified into 7 categories, the most important of which is the personal pronoun category. We'd learn only about them here, reserving the rest for later chapters on pronouns.

a)Direct Case

{| border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=1
|- bgcolor=#eeeeee
! align=left | Person
! align=left | Singular
! align=left | Plural
|-
|1st||मैं (I)||हम (We)
|-
|2nd (intimate)||तू (You)||तुम (You)
|-
|2nd (honorary)||आप (You)||आप (You)
|-
|3rd (proximal)||यह (This/It/He/She)||ये (These/They)
|-
|3rd (distal)||वह (That/He/She)||वे (Those/They)
|}
Ex:
मैं खेलता हूँ - I play
आप लिखते हैं - You write
रमेश सुनता है - Ramesh listens

Tip - If you had followed the lessons so far then you must have noticed that there always are separate forms of intimate and honorary 2nd persons and that the honorary 2nd person uses the same the form for both sing. And plural. This originates from the practice in Sanskrit to use plural forms for a higher authority/elders/respected people to show them respect and honor. 

b)Dative case
The dative case is generally used to indicate the noun/pronoun to whom something is given. For example, in &quot;John gave Mary a book&quot;. The thing being given may be a tangible object, such as &quot;a book&quot; or &quot;a pen&quot;, or it may be an intangible abstraction, such as &quot;an answer&quot; or &quot;help&quot;. The dative generally marks the indirect object of a verb.

&quot;He built a snowman for me&quot; can also be rendered as &quot;He built [for] me a snowman&quot;. In this example, the generic objective pronoun &quot;me&quot; functions as a dative pronoun.

{| border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=1
|- bgcolor=#eeeeee
! align=left | Person
! align=left | Singular
! align=left | Plural
|-
|1st||मुझे/मुझको||हमें/हमको
|-
|2nd (intimate)||तुम्हे/तुमको|| तुम्हें/तुमको
|-
|2nd (honorary)||आपको||आपको
|-
|3rd (proximal)||इसे/इसको||इन्हें/इनको
|-
|3rd (distal)||उसे/उनको||उनें/उनको
|}
Ex:
मुझे एक कलम चाहिए - I need a pen
उसे एक खत मिला - He got a letter
इनें पानी दो - Give them water

c)Genitive/possessive ('s/of)

{| border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=1
|- bgcolor=#eeeeee
! align=left | Person
! align=left | Singular (masculine)
! align=left | Singular (feminine)
! align=left | Plural (masculine)
! align=left | Plural (feminine)
|-
|1st||मेरा (my/mine)||मेरी (my/mine)||हमारा| (our/ours)|हमारी (our/ours)
|-
|2nd (intimate)||तेरा (your/yours)||तेरी (your/yours)|| तुम्हारा (your/yours)||तुम्हारी (your/yours)
|-
|2nd (honorary)||आपका (your/yours)||आपकी (your/yours)||आपका (your/yours)||आपकी (your/yours)
|-
|3rd (proximal)||इसका (of this/Its/his)||इसकी (of this/Its/her)||इनका (their)||इनकी (theirs)
|-
|3rd (distal)||उसका (his)||उसकी (her)||उनका (their)||उनकी (their)
|}
Ex:
ये किताबें मेरी हैं - These books are mine
मेरी किताबें पुरानी हैं - My books are old
तुम्हारा घर बडा है - Your house is big
उसके पेड हरे हैं - His trees are green

d) Ablative

Ablative pronoun/nouns in general represent a motion away from something as &quot;ablative&quot; is derived from the Latin ablatus, the (irregular) perfect passive participle of auferre &quot;to carry away&quot;. Their use in Hindi sentences however can be roughly correspond to some work done &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;by&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; somebody/something.

{| border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=1
|- bgcolor=#eeeeee
! align=left | Person
! align=left | Singular
! align=left | Plural
|-
|1st||मुझसे||हमसे
|-
|2nd (intimate)||तुझसे/तुमसे||तुमसे
|-
|2nd (honorary)||आपसे||आपसे
|-
|3rd (proximal)||इससे||इनसे
|-
|3rd (distal)||उससे||उनसे
|}
Ex:
मुझसे गलती हो गई - I made a mistake (lit:A mistake was committed by me)
मेरा तुमसे भरोसा उठ गया - I've lost faith on you
आपसे यही उम्मीद थी - This was expected of you

e)Locative

Locative case indicates a location. It corresponds vaguely to the English prepositions &quot;in&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, &quot;at&quot;, and &quot;by&quot; combined with nouns/pronouns.

{| border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=1
|- bgcolor=#eeeeee
! align=left | Person
! align=left | Singular
! align=left | Plural
|-
|1st||मुझपर||हमपर
|-
|2nd (intimate)||तुझपर||तुमपर
|-
|2nd (honorary)||आपपर||आपपर
|-
|3rd (proximal)||इसपर||इनपर
|-
|3rd (distal)||उसपर||उनपर
|}
Ex:
मुझपर भरोसा करो - Have faith in me
ईश्वर तुमपर दया करे - May God have pity on you
सारी उम्मीदें उसपर टिकी हैं - All hopes rest on him

f)Ergative

{| border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=1
|- bgcolor=#eeeeee
! align=left | Person
! align=left | Singular
! align=left | Plural
|-
|1st||मैंने||हमने
|-
|2nd (intimate)||तुने||तुमने
|-
|2nd (honorary)||आपने||आपने
|-
|3rd (proximal)||इसने||इन्होंने
|-
|3rd (distal)||उसने||उन्होंने
|}
Ex:
मैंने सब देख लिया - I have seen everything
क्या तुने काम किया - Have you done the job
सीता ने खाना खाया - Sita ate the food

Note – Often the word 'लोग' which means people is added to plural pronouns for emphasizing and/or indicating the plurality itself. Such as वे लोग खाते हैं, हम लोग खेलते हैं and so on.

      <comment>/* Fattening Purposes, Breeds for */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Fattening Purposes, Breeds for ==

There is no need, in treating of the fattening of cattle, to dwell long on the subject of the most suitable breeds for this purpose. Lists of the best breeds are constantly before us, and their fame is practically universal. Indeed, the care and attention which has been bestowed on the various breeds of late years is such that it is even now a matter of great difficulty to say which are really the best for fattening purposes. The Shorthorn has long been in the front rank as a beef-producer, but the Aberdeen-Angus is every bit as good; and the shapely Devon, though perhaps it may fatten a trifle more slowly, is little, if any, behind. The Norfolk farmer prefers the Red Poll, and even the Sussex cattle, until lately bred more for draught (strength and traction in pulling weights horizontally) purposes than anything else, have had such care and attention bestowed on them that they promise to take a foremost place—so that with Herefords, Galloways, &amp;c, there is plenty of choice, and amongst any of the breeds named it is difficult to go wrong.

The Shorthorn, Aberdeen-Angus, Hereford, and Devon perhaps head the list, but local circumstances are one of the best guides as to the most suitable breed. Mention must, however, be made of the place that well-bred cross-breeds, if we may use the term, are taking as beef-producers. The produce of a cross between pure-bred animals usually partakes of the qualities of both parents, besides being a trifle harder in constitution, so that we can understand the position they take at the great shows. The AberdeenAngus-Shorthorn cross, and that between the Shorthorn and Galloway, are two of the best known, especially in the North, and many farmers who have large numbers of cattle through their hands prefer them to any other, pure-bred or not. The good qualities of the cross-bred are not, it should be noted, by any means certain of transmission to their offspring, and breeding from them is risky and uncertain.

      <comment>/* Comparative Utility of Burned and Unburned Lime */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Caustic or Burned Lime ==

Definition - limestone which has been burned and slaked.

== Carbonated or Unburned Lime ==

Definition - lime in its natural state, chalk, sea shells.

== Comparative Utility of Burned and Unburned Lime ==

Of the comparative utility of burned and unburned Lime. Is there no advantage, then, we may ask, in using caustic or burned rather than carbonated or unburned lime 1 If the ultimate effects of both upon the land be the same, why be at the expense of burning 1 Among other benefits arising from the use of burned lime, may be enumerated the following:—

1. By burning and slaking, the lime is reduced to the state of an impalpable powder, finer than could be obtained by any available method of crushing. It can in consequence be diffused more uniformly through the soil, and hence a smaller quantity will produce an equal effect. This minute state of division also promotes in a wonderful degree the chemical action of the lime. In all cases chemical action takes place between exceedingly minute particles of matter ; and among solid substances the action is more rapid the finer the powder to which they can be reduced. Thus a mass of iron or lead slowly rusts or tarnishes in the air, but if the mass of either metal be reduced to the state of an impalpable powder—which can be done by certain chemical means —it will take fire when simply exposed to the air at the ordinary temperature, and will burn till it is entirely converted into oxide of iron, or oxide of lead. By mere mechanical division, the apparent action of the oxygen of the air upon metals is augmented and hastened in this extraordinary degree ; and a similar heightening of the chemical influence of lime takes place when it is brought, in an impalpable state, into contact with the vegetable matter upon which it is intended to act.

2. The effect of burned lime is more powerful and more immediate than that of unburned lime in the form of chalk, marl, or shell sand. Hence, it sooner neutralizes the acids which exist in the soil, and sooner causes that decomposition of vegetable matter of every kind to commence, upon which its efficacy, in a great degree, depends. Hence, when it can easily be procured, it is better for our grass or arable lands, for such as contain an excess of vegetable matter, and especially for such as abound in that dead or inert form of organic matter which requires a stronger stimulus —the presence of more powerful chemical affinities, that is—to bring it into active decomposition. In such cases, tho lime has already done much good before it has been brought into tho

mild state —by exposure in the soil—and, remaining afterwards in this state in the soil, it still serves, in a great measure, the same slower after purposes, as the original addition of carbonate would have done.

3. Besides, if any portion of it, after the lapse of two or three years, still linger in the caustic state, it will continue to provoke more rapid changes among the organic substances in the soil, than mild lime alone could have done.

4. Further, quick-lime is soluble in water, and hence every shower that falls and sinks into the soil carries with it a portion of lime, so long as any of it remains in the caustic state. It thus reaches acid matters that lie beneath the surface, and alters and ameliorates even the sub-soil itself.

5. It is not a small additional recommendation of quick-lime, that limestone, by burning, loses about 44 per cent of its weight—chiefly carbonic acid—thus enabling nearly twice the quantity of lime to be conveyed from place to place at the same cost of transport. This not only causes a direct saving of money—as when the burned chalk of Antrim is carried by sea to the Ayrshire coasts —but an additional saving of labor also upon the farm—where the number of hands and horses is often barely sufficient for the necessary work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Cream Separator, How Works ==

Centrifugal force is used to separate the cream from the milk. The receptacle for the milk is arranged with a spindle passing through the casing, so that it can be revolved at the rate of from 1,000 to 1,500 revolutions per minute. The centrifugal force throws the heavier milk near the outer part of the receptacle, where it is drawn off through a pipe for the purpose. The lighter cream, remaining near the center, is drawn out through another pipe. There is also a supply pipe so that the original milk can be run in while the machine is in operation.

== How is Citric Acid Made? ==

Citric acid is made on a large scale from the juice of the lime and the lemon, chiefly in the months of November and December. The juice is fermented for some time, to free it from mucilage; then boiled, filtered, and neutralized with powdered chalk and a little milk of lime. The precipitate of calcium citrate so obtained is decomposed with dilute sulphuric acid; and the resulting solution of citric acid is separated by filtration, evaporated to remove calcium sulphate, and then concentrated in vacuum pans.

== Cider Vinegar, Making ==

If you have a good barrel that has had vinegar in it before, it will always be desirable to keep it for the express purpose of containing it, and never to use it for anything else. The advantage of this will be, that your cask will be well seasoned, which will materially increase the acidity, promote the quality, and accelerate the progress of the vinegar, so as to bring it to perfection, and give it a superior strength and flavour.

Take any quantity of cider that is old, strong, harsh, or of an inferior quality, and add to it the same quantity of cider from the wring, or press; rouse it up well, and fix it in a warm place, or in the sun, which is certainly the best for its progress; stir it well till the acetous or second fermentation be brought on, after which it should remain in that state till it becomes quite sour; then remove it to the cellar for use, leaving open the bung at the time of making, and when settling after the fermentation. Stop it only with a slate or tile afterwards ; the vinegar will soon arrive at full flavour and perfection.

      <comment>/* January Work */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The following instructions are especially suited to our Northern latitudes. Slight variations will be necessary in the South, owing to the early seasons of that part of the country. 

== January Work ==

There is little particular work for January in cold latitudes, except that which has been left over from December, or which is general work for all winter. When the ground is open, late fall and early spring work of a colder latitude appropriately occupy the farmer more or less during the winter months.

Guard against damage by water, during thaws, about buildings and in the field.

The Work Shop.- A workshop, provided with the most important carpenters', painters', and metalworkers' tools, is what every farmer should have. Let it contain a bench with vise, nails, screws, a hammer, hatchet and drawing knife, saws, planes, chisels, center bits and stock, and other carpenters' tools. Paints, pots and brushes, of two or three sizes; varnish pot and glue pot ; a steel-jawed vise, assortments of files, cold chisels, monkeywrench and other wrenches, an anvil, or a hard-wood block, which will do for one; strong pincers, a set of round, square-jawed and cutting pliers, and a soldering iron; sheets of tin, wires, rivets, etc.; besides a good stock of boards and timber of various kinds. Add to this a few simple articles of the harness-makers' kit. such as awls, wax, thread, rivets, with &quot;set&quot; punches, and leather. Thus provided, many a profitable day's work may be done.

Buildings.— On mild days open and air thoroughly, especially the cellars. Look to the protection of roofs, water pipes, etc., against frost.

Stock. — Keep no more than can be kept well. Horses, with enough to eat, wilt beat exposure much better than cows and young cattle. Give good shelter to all ; if possible, warm, but well-ventilated stables, which arc a great economy of food. Let no stock run down m flesh; &quot;spring poor&quot; cattle are a burning disgrace. It will be weeks before poor oxen will be able to do a good day's work in the spring. Milk cows? especially young ones, to within five or six weeks of calving, and feed well. Grain or oilcake pays its cost twice over; once in fat or milk, and once in the better quality of the manure. Feed sheep grain, in small, but regular quantities, and see that each gets its share ; give all kinds range of a good dry yard, and warm sheds for nights and wet weather. Salt .in'! water are essentials to the well-being of all kinds of domestic animals, summer and winter. Fattening stock should be fed and watered regularly, keep very clean, in warm stables, well ventilated, and abundantly littered ; give exercise and air on mild days. Ground and cooked food, except for sheep, perhaps, is a great economy.

Corn, Small Grains, Straw or Hay, may be still on hand for sale. If sold, you &quot;owe the land a debt which you must repay, or be poorer, for it is a draft on your capital. Watch the markets, calculate probabilities, and sell when a fair price is offered ; but get the full market price as near as you can. Never sell hay or straw or grain without conscientiously returning an equivalent in the purchase of corn-fodder, oilcake, ot grain for feeding, or bones for manure.

Permanent Improvements. — It is a good time to plan for building or alteration to buildings, and for such work as reclaiming swamps, clearing off stumps, moving walls, old fences, and the accumulated rubbish of neglected parts of the farm. 

The winter is often open enough to do much labor in the swamps in getting out muck and similar work, and that which has been weathered enough may be hauled to the barn, or to places where you mean to make compost heap.

Ice. — The time for gathering the store of ice in cold latitudes may pass quickly. Early in the month, prepare the house ; clear out the old stock, if low ; see that the drain and air trap work well, that the flooring is level, and the bed at the bottom is shaken up and dried. Cut the ice in blocks to pack evenly in the house ; if it is a small one, pack in the coldest weather, when the ice is very cold and dry.

== The Tree Trap (Steel Trap) ==

{{stub}}

== Brick Trap for Birds ==

This is a very old invention, and has always been one of the three or four stereotyped specimens of traps selected for publication in all Boys' Books. It is probably well known to most of our readers.

Take four bricks, and arrange them on the ground, as seen in our engraving, letting them rest on their narrow sides. If properly arranged, they should have a space between them, nearly as large as the broad surface of the brick. A small, forked twig of the shape shown in the separate drawing (b) having a small niece cut away from each side of the end, should then be procured. Next cut a slender stick, about four inches in length, bluntly

[[File:19th_century_knowledge_traps_and_snares_brick_trap.jpg]]

pointed at each end. A small plug with a flat top should now be driven into the ground, inside the trap, about three inches from either of the end bricks and projecting about two inches from the ground. The trap is then ready to be set. Lay the flat end of the forked twig over the top of the plug, with the forks pointing forward, or toward the end of the enclosure nearest the plug, The pointed stick should then be adjusted, placing one end on the flat end of the fork, over the plug, and the other beneath the fifth brick, which should be rested upon it. The drawing (b) clearly shows the arrangement of the pieces. The bait, consisting of berries, bird-seed, or other similar substances, should then be scattered on the ground on the inside of the inclosure. When the bird flies to the trap he will generally alight on the forked twig, which by his weight tilts to one side and dislodges the pieces, thus letting fall the sustained brick.

It is not intended to kill the bird, and when rightly constructed will capture it alive. Care is necessary in setting the topmost brick in such a position that it will fall aright, and completely

[[File:19th_century_knowledge_traps_and_snares_trigger_stick.jpg]]

cover the open space. This is a very simple and effectual little contrivance, and oan be made with a box instead of bricks, if desired. A piece of board may also be substituted for the top brick, and the enclosure beneath made larger by spreading the bricks further apart, thus making a more roomy dungeon for the captive bird.

== Asian Squirrel Trap ==

(author's note - this could be used on chipmunks, also.) We passed several squirrel traps of an ingenious and simple construction. On an overhanging branch a seed (chesnut) of which the squirrels are fond is placed, and bound to the branch by a double hand of cane; the squirrel cannot get at the seed without putting his head through a noose of the cane, and on his disengaging the bait the stone drops and tightens the noose round the squirrel's neck: they eat the flesh of this animal as a great delicacy.

== Indian Deer Funnel ==

Besides their bows they had other devices to take their game, sometimes by double hedges a mile or two in length, and a mile wide at one end, and made narrow by degrees until they came to a gap of about six feet, against which they lay hid to shoot the deer as they came through in the day-time, and at night they set deer-traps, being springs made of young trees

== Twitch-Up Snare ==

== The Poacher's Snare ==

Our next example represents one of the oldest and best snares in existence, — simple in construction, and almost infallible in its operations. It is the one in most common use among the poachers of England, hence its name. The pieces are three in number, and may be cut from pine wood, affording easy and profitable employment for the jack-knife during odd hours and rainy days, when time hangs heavily.

The pieces are so simple in form and easy of construction that a sufficient number for fifty traps might be whittled in less than two hours, by any smart boy, who is at all &quot; handy &quot; with his jack-knife.

If a few good broad shingles can be found, the work is even much easier,—mere splitting and notching being then all that is necessary. The bait stick should be about eight inches long, pointed at one end, and supplied with a notch in the other at about half an inch from the tip. The upright stick should be considerably shorter than the bait stick, and have a length of about ten inches, one end being nicely pointed, and the broad side of the other extremity supplied

[[File:19th_century_knowledge_traps_and_snares_poachers_snare_1.jpg]]

with a notch similar to the bait stick. About four inches from the blunt end, and on the narrow side of the stick, a square notch should be cut, sufficiently large to admit the bait stick loosely. The catch piece now remains. This should be about two and a-half inches in length, half an inch in width, and &quot;*&quot;~ bevelled off at each end into a flat edge. The shapes of the different pieces, together with their setting, will be readily understood by a look at our illustration.

A hundred of these pieces will make a small bundle, and may be easily carried by the young trapper, together with his other necessaries, as he starts off into the woods. He will thus be supplied with parts for thirty-three traps, all ready to be set, only requiring the stakes for the pens, which may be easily cut in the woods. Having selected a flexible sapling about five feet in length, and having stripped it of its branches, proceed to adjust the pieces. Take one of the upright sticks, and insert it firmly in the ground, with its upper notch facing the sapling, and at about four feet distant from it. Bend down the &quot; springer,&quot; and by its force determine the required length for the draw-string attaching one end to the tip of the sapling, and the other near the end of a catch piece, the latter having its bevelled side uppermost. The wire noose should then be attached to the draw-string about six inches above the catchpiece. The pen should now be constructed as. previously directed. Its entrance should be on the side furthest from the springer, and should be so built as that the peg in the ground shall be at the back part of the enclosure. The pen being finished, the trap may be set.

Insert the bait stick with bait attached into the square notch in the side of the upright peg; or, if desired, it may be adjusted by a pivot or nail through both sticks, as seen in our illustration, always letting the baited end project toward the opening. Draw down the catch piece, and fit its ends into the notches in the back of the upright peg and extremity of the bait-stick. By now pulling the latter slightly, and gently withdrawing the hand, the pieces will hold themselves together, only awaiting a lift at the bait to dislodge them. Adjust the wire loop at the opening of the pen, and you may leave the trap with the utmost confidence in its ability to take care of itself, and any unlucky intruder who tries to steal its property.

Most of the snares which we shall describe are constructed from rough twigs, as these are always to be found in the woods, and with a little practice are easily cut and shaped into the desired forms. If desired, however, many of them may le whittled from pine wood like the foregoing, and the pieces carried in a bundle, ready for immediate use. In either case, whether made from the rough twigs or seasoned wood, it is a good plan to have them already prepared, and thus save time at the trapping ground when time is more valuable.

== Miller Sparrow and Bird Trap ==

The trap below was designed by Mr. Charles W. Miller, director of the Worthington Society for the Study of Bird Life. It is especially adapted to poultry and pigeon yards, where it can be permanently installed. The poultry or pigeons are fed in the trap, the door being left open until birds are accustomed to feed there with them. Later the door is closed and by putting a little bait on the shelf and considerable on the ground inside, the birds are enticed to enter through the open corners at the top. After they have learned the way in and out over the shelf, the corners are closed. The sparrows now enter between the partitions and are unable to return. Captives are removed from this trap by means of a short handled net, from which they can be taken by hand. A few birds should be left in the cage as decoys. Captives are removed and the decoys supplied with food and water at dusk when outside birds are at roost.

[[File:19th_century_knowledge_traps_and_snares_miller_sparrow_trap_1.PNG]]

The construction of the Miller trap may be described under four heads: (1) The cage, (2) the frame, (3) the partitions, and (4) the shields. Figure 10 shows the skeleton of this trap without the wire netting. This should be painted green or gray before the netting is applied. Regular aviary netting of 1 by 3/4 inch mesh, or poultry netting of 3/4 inch mesh, may be used. The door has a hook on each side and spring hinges. Around the top of the cage extends a shelf about 8 inches wide.

When extensive trapping is undertaken, the traps employed must fulfill certain requirements in addition to ultimate efficiency. Especially important are simple and prompt action, portability, and cheapness, all of which are found in the funnel trap.

== Determining the Length of Bow and Arrow ==

Among some of the Indian tribes of today, certain rules, regarding the bow and arrow which were worked out centuries ago are still in use. Of course, a boy could not use a bow that was made for a man, and two men differing in physical strength could not well use the same bow; so a difference in the size and strength of the individual led to modifications of the bow and arrow so that they could meet the requirements of each individual. Each individual made his own bow and arrow, and in making them certain units of measurement were and are still employed. The Indian hunter in making his bow does not use a standard length; the bow must be exactly eight times the span from the thumb to the little finger of the hunter using it, and the length of the arrow must be exactly the distance from the armpit to the end of the thumb, measuring on the inside of the extended arm.

== Making an Indian Bow ==

As the Indian bow is considered the most powerful and best, a description of its construction will be a good guide for making one for civilized use. The Indian bow is generally four feet long, one and one-half inches wide, and an inch thick at the middle. It tapers from the center toward the ends, and is but half an inch wide and half an inch thick at the extremities.

At one end, the bow string is notched into the wood and made permanently fast, while at the other end two notches are cut, and the string at that end of the bow is made like a slip-knot or loop.

When the bow is to be used, the warrior sets the end to which the string is made fast firmly on the ground, and then bends down the other end until the loop slips into the notch. It is never kept strung except when in actual use, as it would lose its strength and elasticity by being constantly bent. The wood used is ash, hickory, ironwood, elm and cedar. All of the wood, save cedar, requires seasoning, and is not worked until thoroughly dry. For the use of boys and beginners the size should be much reduced.

The Indians do not generally put a very attractive mechanical finish upon their bows. The weapons are made for practical purposes and not for ornamentation. The bow made after the fashion given above may be attractively finished by giving the inner surface and the edges an oval shape. After smoothing up, rub with a woolen cloth dampened in linseed oil, then glue to the central part of the bow a strip of green or red velvet six inches long.

== To Make a Good Bow ==

Take a good, clear billet split from mulberry, sassafras, southern cedar, black locust, ash, or apple-tree, giving preference to the woods in the order named. Let the billet be from five to seven feet long, according to the desired length of the bow. Now, with great care shave the piece down to a uniform size for its whole length, say nearly circular, and two and a half inches in diameter. Lay the piece away to dry in the shade for two months, taking care that no hint of moisture ever reaches it. When it is thoroughly seasoned, finish as follows; first, mark the exact center of the billet, and from this point in the direction of what is to be the lower end of the bow lay off a space of five inches for the handle. Trom each extremity of the handle taper the bow to the ends, each of which must be a shade larger than the tip of the archer's third finger. Now dress the handle and body of the bow down till by trying it you find it nearly of the proper strength, then flatten the back a little the whole length of the bow, glue a bit of green plush round the handle and your bow is ready for the horn tips, which are the ends of cow-horns bored out to fit over the bow's ends and nocked or notched as seen in the detail drawings (here reprinted from Scribner's for July); but it must be noticed that the drawing marked b was either by my own fault or by a mistake of the engraver made wrong. The wood of the bow is there made flat on the inner side and rounded on the outer or back; it should be just the reverse. The hole bored in the horn to receive the tips of the bow should be deep enough to let the wood pass in to slightly above the nock. To make the horn work easily, boil it in water for an hour or two. A bow of six feet in length and of sixty pounds 

[[File:19th_century_knowledge_archery_bow_and_arrow_parts_detail.jpg]]

drawing power will throw a good arrow two hundred and twenty-five yards. Of course the reader knows at once that his bow must be suited to his muscular force and to the experience he has in archery. Fifty pounds drawing weight is about right for an ordinary man to begin with. The length of the bow should be two or three inches in excess of the archer's height. A lady's bow may be from twenty-eight to forty pounds strong. I have somewhere seen it stated that Her Majesty Queen Victoria in her younger days greatly enjoyed archery, and gloried in her ability to brace and draw a fifty-five pound bow.

== Tools of the Arrow Maker ==

Fig. 1. Shaft Straightener. The example figured is from the Hupa (Athapascan) tribe of California. It is a piece of yew ten inches long, spindle-shaped and having an oblong hole through the middle. The arrow shaft is drawn through the hole and straightened by pressure on the ends of the tool.

Fig. 2. The Glue Stick, which is simply a bit of wood having one end covered with glue, used like a tinner's soldering iron.

Figs. 3 and 4. Arrowhead Chippers. Showing the primitive method of joining the working parts to the handle. One point is a bit of bone, the other a rod of soft iron, which in this example replaces one of bone or antler.

Fig. 5. The Pitching Tool. A column of antler used like a cold chisel in knocking off spalls or flakes or blades by means of some kind of hammer.

Figs. 6 and 7. Rasping And Polishing Stones. All the American tribes used coarse sandstone for wood rasps, and in the making of arrow shafts cut grooves in the rasp to give rotundity to the wood. The polishing was done with finer sandstone, shagreen, siliceous grass, etc.

Fig. 8. Glue Shell. An implement made of muscle shell worn over the finger and employed in smoothing down glue and sinew on bows and arrows.

Fig. 9. Saw. In this example an old case knife blade, hacked on the edge. In primitive times wood saws were made of chipped siliceous stone.

== Making an Arrow ==

The arrows must be of well seasoned sticks, perfectly straight and of exactly the same length, for if of different lengths, they fly differently, and unless made in all respects alike, the aim is destroyed. The shafts being made even, the next work is to form the stringnotch. This is done with a sharp knife, and when made properly, the bottom of the notch will be precisely in the center of the shaft.

Heading the arrow - blunt arrows are used for shooting at a mark, etc., but when used for game, steel points or heads are put in. Where the heads are used, a slit is sawed opposite the notch end and the stem of the arrow-head inserted and held by binding with thread. The slit must be exactly in the center.

Feathering the arrow - the next process is to put on the feathers. To do this properly, great care must be taken. Turkey quills are soaked in warm water to make them split easily and uniformly. The leather is then stripped from the quill and put on the shaft.

Three feathers are placed on each shaft and laid equidistant along the stem. The big end of the feather is fastened near the notch of the shaft and laid six inches along the wood, The feathers are glued to the arrow.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[Gambas]] programming language provides a set of '''operators''' that allow values and variables to be compared, evaluated or manipulated. These operators can combined together with values and variables to make expressions. The operators may take unary, dyadic or ternary form, depending on the number of operands that they utilize.

== Assignment operator ==

In [[Gambas]], as with most other programming languages, the '''equals sign''' acts as a dyadic '''assignment operator''' that assigns the value of the expression of the right hand operand to the variable named by the left operand.

== Nudge operators ==

The [[Gambas/Nudge | nudge operators]] ++ and -- are not supported in [[Gambas]]. However the INC and DEC commands and combination assignment operators can be used to [[Gambas/Nudge | increment or decrement]] the values of variables.

The nudge operators ++ and -- are not supported in gambas. However, gambas does provide the INC and DEC commands and combination assignment operators that can be used to increment or decrement variables:

== Nudging variables with INC or DEC ==

The INC and DEC commands can be used to increment or decrement numeric variables:

=== INC ===

 INC variable     ' variable = variable + 1

=== DEC ===

 DEC variable     ' variable = variable - 1

== Nudging variables with the combination assignment operators ==

The combination assignment operators can be used to increment or decrement numeric variables:

 variable += 1    ' variable = variable + 1
 variable -= 1    ' variable = variable - 1

== INC or DEC commands cannot be used on constants or non-numeric variables ==

The INC or DEC commands cannot be used on constants or non-numeric variables.

Attempting to nudge string values with INC or DEC commands will result in a type mismatch error.

Attempting to nudge string values with INC or DEC commands will result in a invalid assignment error.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Gene Expression in Prokaryotes ==
A hallmark difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is chromosomal arrangement.  Eukaryotes, owing to their complexity, have multiple chromosomes containing a variety of mechanisms that regulate gene expression.  Prokaryotes, by contrast, possess a very simple chromosomal arrangement.  Most of the DNA within prokaryotic organisms is housed within a single, circular chromosome.  In some instances, a secondary chromosome, known as a plasmid, may exist.   Prokaryotes act as if by default all the genes are on. The DNA is interpreted word by word and it tells the ribosomes to make everything it says. So to control genes the cell selectively turns off parts it doesn't need at certain times.

The mechanism for doing this, as briefly described in the introduction, is preformed by an operon. An operon is a gene regulatory feature unique to prokaryotes.  It consists of a group of related genes that must be transcribed in sequence.  A &quot;promoter&quot; region lay at the front of the operon, which, when a transcription enzyme binds to it, bends the DNA in a way that makes it easier for transcription factors to access the genes within the operon.  Although there are many kinds of operons in prokaryotes, the lac operon is the best understood and most widely used to teach bacterial gene regulation.  We will use it as a model for presenting the general features of an operon.

As mentioned, the initial component of an operon is the inhibitor gene.  In the case of the lac operon, immediately downfield of the inhibitor gene (lacI), we find the promoter, followed by what is referred to as a &quot;controller,&quot; or sometimes &quot;operator&quot; region.   The inhibitor lacI gene is called &quot;constitutive.&quot;  That means that it is constantly encoded by the prokaryotic cell, no matter what the conditions of its environment may be.  This inhibitor protein, when translated, binds to the controller region of the lac operon.  Once it binds to the controller region, the inhibitor blocks all transcription factors (RNA polymerase) from from progressing down the gene sequence, thus preventing the transcription of genes within the rest of the operon.  

This process is known as a &quot;negative feedback mechanism.&quot;  So long as nothing interferes with the inhibitor enzyme that is bound to the operator region, the genes within the lac operon will never be encoded.  There is. however, a way for the cell to break this negative feedback mechanism.  In the event that the environmental conditions the cell finds itself in change and lactose becomes available, the lactose will be transported across the membrane of the prokaryote, diffuse through the cytoplasm, and bind to a spot on the inhibitor enzyme called the allosteric site.  When the lactose binds, it causes a change in the 3-dimensional structure of the inhibitor enzyme, causing it to let go of the controller region of the lac operon.  When it lets go, RNA polymerase is allowed to complete the process of transcription and the rest of the genes in the operon are thus transcribed. 

[[Image:Lacoperon.jpg]]

The above is a simplified view of the lac operon system. This complex is known as a '''cistron'''. That is, it is a system physically on the DNA strand that controls and produces a genetic product.

==Genetic Recombination in Prokaryotes==

Previously, the presence of a secondary &quot;plasmid&quot; chromosome in many prokaryotes, which is much smaller than the primary circular chromosome, was discussed.  In terms of evolution, the plasmid serves a very important purpose for the prokaryotic genome.  Due to their simplicity, prokaryotes cannot engage in sexual reproduction.  You might imagine the inherent genetic dilemma in a population of organisms that are only capable of dividing asexually, through binary fission, as bacteria do.  Because every individual within a population of bacterial cells is so closely related genetically, they are put at great risk in the event that an environmental stressor emerges that exploits a weakness in the bacterial genome.  One example are molds and fungi that are able to produce molecules that have an antibiotic effect on nearby bacteria -- such as the betalactam molecules that we produce into penicillins.  In the event that such a fungi emerges in an environment cohabited by the prokaryote E. coli, for example, the E. coli population is immediately put under great selection pressures.  They must evolve, or die.  But when its mechanisms for genetic recombination are incredibly simple, how is a population expected to produce enough genetic diversity to survive such an environmental stressor?

In the case of some prokaryotes, such as E. coli, there exists a mechanism for genetic recombination known as the sex pillus, which provides a solution for this dilemma.  The sex pilus allows bacteria that are equipped with it to transfer their secondary chromosome, the plasmid, to a neighbouring bacterial cell.  This process is known as conjugation.  It is the bacterial equivalent of sexual reproduction, or more accurately, a strategy for sharing DNA between individuals in a bacterial population.  An F+ bacterium (Reproductive Factor Positive) contains a plasmid that codes for the sex pillus, which allows a tube used for conjugation to hang off and articulate with a neighboring bacterium (the neighbor being F-, or lacking the gene to encode a sex pilus itself), which it binds to and swaps its plasmid with.  The actual act of copying the plasmid occurs in a similar fashion to DNA replication

In addition to the F+/F- system of conjugation, there exists the possibility for &quot;Hfr&quot; (High frequency recombinant) cells to exist.  Hfr cells contain a fertility factor directly within their primary circular DNA region, as opposed to storing the fertility factor on their secondary plasmid.  When an Hfr cell conjugates with an F- cell, the host F- cell remains F-.  This occurrence is random, as is the location within the bacterial chromosome that the factor incorporates.  

The ability of an Hfr cell to recombine with an F- neighbor comes with some risk.  In the event of attempting recombination, extra genetic information can mistakenly be carried out of the Hfr cell.  When the F factor leaves that cell, the cell is said to be &quot;F Prime&quot; (F').  The exiting plasmid retains the ability to code for its reproduction factor, and brings this baggage along with it into the F- cell.  The end result is the original Hfr cell losing its ability to recombine, while the recombined F- cell becomes an Hfr, because it assimilated the sex factor gene within its own genome.  

Conjugation is a haphazard process.  Forming a complete F' bacterial cell is a little more difficult than recombination under other scenarios, because the sex pillus is a weak structure and usually breaks before the full F factor is transferred.  Regardless, it still solves the problem of genetic diversity in bacterial cells.  Cells from whole other species -- for instance, a population of E. coli cells and S. aureus cells -- can swap DNA via this mechanism.  It both accounts for the ability of populations to rapidly evolve, and challenges the usefulness of the biological species concept in identifying and categorizing bacterial &quot;species.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Eukaryotic Gene Expression ==
The gene regulatory mechanisms of Eukaryotic organisms are slightly more complex than the single, operon controlled model seen in prokaryotes.  This complexity is due to the multicellular nature of Eukaryotes.  Every eukaryotic cell contains the same DNA as every other cell in the organism.  This is known as the organism's &quot;genome.&quot;  In order for cells to specialize and turn into, say, a neuron or a muscle cell, gene regulatory elements must turn off certain genes and upregulate other genes. So although every cell in a eukaryote has the same genome, they each have different proteins that are active at different concentrations.  This difference is known as an organism's &quot;proteome,&quot; or the sum total of all proteins currently encoded by the cell. We will discuss some of the common regulatory mechanisms seen in eukaryotes that allow for this differentiation seen in cells.

== Vegetable Food of the Luisenos Indians ==

The Luisenos had a great variety of food, though to a casual observer the district they inhabit appears to be, for the most part, of a semi-desert character, especially in the latter half of the year.

The winter and spring rains cause numerous annual plants to grow, and many of these are used as greens, being either boiled or eaten fresh with salt.

The seeds of many plants are also used, besides numerous fruits and berries. Seeds are always parched, this being effected by placing them in a broken piece of pottery, or a vessel made for that purpose, and toasting them over the fire, stirring them to prevent burning. Formerly they were often parched by being placed in a basket with live coals, and shaken until they were sufficiently cooked. After being parched, seeds are pounded into flour in a mortar. When required for use, this flour is mixed with water to form a mush, which is eaten cold.

The staple food of the Luisenos, as of so many California Indians, was acorns. At least six species of oaks are found in Luiseno territory. The acorn considered by far the most palatable is that of the black or Kellogg's oak, Quercug Californica. This begins to be found at an elevation of about three thousand feet, and is abundant on Palomar.

Next to the black oak the acorns of the common live oak, red oak, or field oak, Qiwrcus agrifolia, are most esteemed. This tree is found from the coast to over three thousand feet above sea level. The acorns of this species contain more oil than those of the black oak, and the meal ground from them is of a yellow color.

Quercus chrysolepsis, usually called the maul or Valparaiso oak, grows on Palomar in the canons at a somewhat lower elevation than the black oak. Its acorns, which are the largest and hardest of any of the oaks, are also considered to be palatable, though difficult to grind, and are gathered when those of the two species first mentioned fail.

The acorns of the white oak, Quercus Engelmanni, the live oak, Quercus Wislizeni, and the scrub oak, Quercus dumosa, are not at all esteemed, and are only used when other acorns cannot be obtained.

Until quite recently large quantities of acorns were gathered and stored away in acorn granaries. When required they were taken from the granary, placed one by one on a stone, and struck with another stone with sufficient force to crack the hulls. They were then placed in the sun, which caused the hulls to break open, after which these were removed from the acorn with a bone tool, maavish.

Afterwards the acorns were pounded into flour in a mortar, a stone pestle being used for this purpose. The meal is leached with hot water to take out the bitterness. This is sometimes accomplished by placing it in a rush basket and pouring warm water over it; at other times by placing it in a hole made in sand, and then pouring warm water over it, the water soaking away through the sand. The leached meal is afterwards cooked in an earthen vessel.

The importance attached to acorns as food is shown by the fact that large pines were often cut down merely for the sake of the acorns stored in the bark by the woodpeckers.

The kernel of a wild fruit, a kind of plum or cherry, Cerasus or Primus ilicifolia, was formerly used to some extent as food. The fruit was spread in the sun until thoroughly dried, when the shells were cracked and the kernels extracted. These were ground into flour which was leached and cooked in exactly the same manner as acorn meal. This flower is almost as white as that made from wheat. The pulp of the fruit is also eaten, but it is exceedingly thin, though not unpleasant to the taste. This fruit grows but sparingly in the San Luis Eey basin, but large quantities grow in the hills and canons around Cahuilla valley, where it was formerly an important article of food.

Choke cherries are much liked, notwithstanding their puckery taste. They are considered to improve by being kept for a few days after being gathered.

The berries of the toyon or Christmas berry, Heteromeles or Photinia arbutifolia, are used as food, being parched and eaten without further preparation.

The berries of several species of gooseberries, currants, and blackberries were eaten, but these grow but sparingly, and were not an important article of food.

Elderberries grow in great abundance in some parts of the San Luis Rey valley. They are much liked, and were formerly gathered in large quantities and dried, besides being cooked and eaten when fresh.

Wild grapes, which abound in the San Luis Rey valley, are cooked and eaten, but they were never dried and preserved like elderberries.

There are several species of prickly pear cactus, the fruit of some of which is much esteemed, while that of others is not. It is eaten fresh, and was formerly peeled, dried in the sun, and stored away for future use, being eaten without being cooked. The seeds were saved, parched, ground into meal, mixed with water in the usual manner, and used as food. The seeds of the cactus known as &quot;cholla&quot; were also used.

The berries of the aromatic sumac, Rhus trilobata, were ground into meal and used as food, as were manzanita berries. The pulp only of the latter, but the entire berry of the sumac, was used. Neither of these kinds of berries were parched before being ground, nor was the meal afterwards cooked, but simply mixed with water and eaten.

The bulbs of several plants of the lily family were used as food. They were mostly eaten fresh, but were sometimes cooked. The edible ground-mushroom is little esteemed, but the tree mushrooms that grow on cottonwood and willow trees are still a favorite article of food. Care is taken to gather them when tender. They are prepared for food by boiling.

The scape or stalk of Yucca Whipplei, which grows quite abundantly in many localities on the hillsides, is roasted and eaten, as also was formerly the head of the plant, which was prepared for food by roasting in an earth oven.

By earth oven is meant a pit dug in the ground, in which stones are placed, and a fire built, which is kept up until the stones are well heated, when the article to be cooked is placed among them and covered over with earth.

The blossoms of both Yucca Whipplei and Yucca Mohavensis are eaten, being cooked in water.

The pods of Yucca Mohavensis are also eaten, being prepared by roasting in the coals.

The fresh tender shoots of the white sage are peeled and eaten raw. The fresh shoots of a large rush were also eaten raw formerly.

Mesquite trees are somewhat plentiful in parts of Luiseno territory, but not in the San Luis Rey valley, so the flour of mesquite beans is not an article of food here, though it is occasionally brought for sale from other localities.

Of the plants used as greens the most esteemed now-a-days is wild mustard, though this is probably an introduced plant, as it has no Luiseno name. It is the earliest food plant of the year.

Watercress and wild celery are both cooked, but not eaten fresh.

Several species of wild clover are eaten both fresh and cooked. Lamb's quarter, Indian lettuce, the leaves of the California poppy, peppergrass, and a great many other plants are boiled for greens.

Wild oats formerly were a favorite article of food. They were stripped with the hands from the stalk while standing, afterwards parched together with the husks, and pounded into meal in the usual manner. A favorite food is said to have been composed of oatmeal and dried elderberries, mixed with a little ground chia, the latter being probably used for seasoning.

The seeds of '' chia,'' the Spanish name of Salvia columbariae, seem to be more esteemed than any other. Others much used are those of the white and black sages, the thistle sage, the soapplant Chenopodium Californicum, peppergrass, and several Compositae. Some of the seeds used are so excessively small and difficult to collect that it seems probable they were more used by way of seasoning than for their actual food value.

An edible gum is obtained from the white oak, Quercus Engelmanni; this is the deposit of a scale-insect. After being gathered it is carefully washed to remove its bitter taste, and is then ready for chewing. It is used exactly as chewing gum.

Another gum is obtained from the milkweed, Asclepias eriocarpa. The sap of this plant, which runs out freely when the stems are cut, is collected and boiled in water until it coagulates. It is then ready for use as chewing gum, and is much esteemed, but is not as lasting as that of the white oak.

== Flesh and Hunting of the Luisenos Indians ==

The largest game animal was the black-tail deer, formerly very abundant and still found. They were formerly hunted with bow and arrow, and were also, it is said, taken in snares.

Those who hunted with bow and arrow sometimes used a stuffed deer head with the antlers attached. This they fastened on their head, and on seeing a deer, would slowly approach it, lowering and raising, or bobbing the deer head from side to side. In this manner they often approached sufficiently near to the deer to kill it. The snare was made by placing a running noose in a deer trail, so that the animal would entangle its feet in it. The noose being fastened to a pole which was bent over and lightly fastened to the ground, the struggles of the deer would loosen it; it would then fly back and leave the animal suspended in the air.

There is a place where deer were once said to have been killed by being driven over a precipice, at the foot of which they would be found dead; but it is also said that after a time it was impossible to drive them over it, as they would double back in spite of every effort to prevent them.

Venison was cooked by broiling on hot coals, also in the earth oven, and sometimes, though less often, by boiling in water. When cooked in the earth oven it was sometimes pounded up finely in a mortar, and stored away for future use. The entrails and blood of deer were both used.

In some parts of the territory occupied by the Luisenos antelopes were formerly abundant, notably between Temecula and San Jacinto, but the last were killed about twenty years or more ago. It is said there never were any in the upper San Luis Rey valley.

It is doubtful if much large game was ever killed by the Luisenos with their crude weapons. The principal animal food probably always consisted of jackrabbits and rabbits, which are still the chief game animals. But an exception must be made of the people who lived permanently on the coast, whose chief flesh diet was fish and mussels.

Now-a-days jackrabbits and rabbits are either killed with a shotgun or small caliber rifle, or hunted on horseback with sticks two and a half or three feet long.

Formerly these animals were hunted with bows and arrows, or trapped by draw nets and snares placed in their runs. They were also driven into a long net stretched across a suitable place, a number of Indians assembling for the purpose.

They were also killed with a flat, curved stick, wakut, which has erroneously been spoken of as a boomerang. Formerly when an Indian went to the field he carried one of these sticks in addition to his bow and arrows. If he saw a rabbit or other animal that he wished to kill standing, he shot at it with the bow; if it was running, he threw the stick at it.

There are two kinds of rabbits, the cottontail and a smaller, darker one weighing only a little more than a pound when full grown.

Rabbits and jackrabbits were usually cooked by broiling on hot coals. They were also sometimes cooked in the earth oven. Sometimes, after being cooked in the latter manner, their flesh, together with the bones, was pounded up in a mortar, and either eaten at once or stored away for future use.

A wood rat is much liked. This animal builds a nest of small sticks, sometimes quite large, in the brush or undergrowth, in the cactus, and occasionally in trees. In hunting it the nests are often set on fire to drive it out, one, or rarely two, being found in each nest. Usually the nest is overturned, and the rats killed with bows and arrows or sticks. Numbers are sometimes killed after a flood has driven them out of their nests in the undergrowth along the river. Several other kinds of rats were formerly used as food, as well as ground squirrels and different kinds of mice. These animals were often trapped. Two flat stones were taken. On the lower one an acorn was placed on end, the upper stone resting on it, so that when the acorn was gnawed through by an animal the stone would fall and kill it. Since only small animals could get between the stones when baited in the above manner, for larger ones, as wood rats and ground squirrels, a short stick was placed on top of the acorns. This made room for them to crawl between the stones and reach the bait.

Tree squirrels were not eaten. Neither were wild pigeons nor doves until quite recently, the latter from superstitious motives. The valley quail, found in great numbers in the San Luis Rey valley and adjacent country, even to the summit of Palomar, have always been eaten. They were formerly killed with the bow, and were also hunted at night with fire, dry stems of the cholla cactus being set on fire and used to attract them; when they flew towards the light they were knocked down with sticks. During a prolonged period of cold rainy weather they become chilled so that they cannot fly far; when in that condition they were formerly sometimes run down by boys. Mountain quail were also eaten. Rats, mice, quails, and squirrels were cooked by broiling on coals.

Ducks, formerly plentiful, were killed with the bow or with the throwing stick. Mudhens were not eaten. Larks and robins and the eggs of ducks and quails were eaten.

Bears were formerly quite common on Palomar, and also in Bear valley. They were occasionally killed, but their flesh was never eaten. Their skins and claws were saved, the latter being used to make necklaces. A stone was erected wherever a bear or mountain lion was killed.

Before a hunt a fire was sometimes built of white sage and Artemisia Californica. The hunters stood around this and in the smoke, the belief being that this absolved them from any breach of social observances they might have committed, which would otherwise bring them ill luck.

Grasshoppers have always been abundant in the San Jose valley, this being one of the localities in which they hatch. They were formerly eaten by the Indians who lived there, and sometimes by others. The manner of taking them was by digging a pit, which was surrounded at a distance by Indians with boughs, who drove them from all sides into the pit. This was of course before they had reached the flying stage of their existence. A fire was built upon them and they were killed and roasted at the same time. They are said to have been eaten without any further preparation.

A large green grub was eaten. It was boiled in water and eaten with salt.

== Clothing of the Luisenos Indians ==

The chief article of clothing was a cape-like garment of fur covering the upper part of the body and reaching almost to the knees, but this was probably only worn in the coldest weather. During most of the year the men are said to have worn no clothing at all. The capes were sometimes made of rabbit skins, cut  nto strips and woven with a woof of twine. Others were made of deer-skins, and some of sea-otter skins. These latter were the most highly prized, but were not common, except perhaps on the coast.

Another article of dress was an apron, pishkwut, generally of net-work, made from the twine obtained from dogbane, Apocynum canndbinum, or the milkweed, Asclepias eriocarpa. Another apron, shehevish, was made of the inner bark of willow or cottonwood. This was worn behind, while the apron of network was worn in front. Both these aprons were worn exclusively by women, who never went entirely unclothed.

A basket hat of coiled ware was worn by women, especially when they had a burden to carry, when it was used to protect the forehead, the cord of the carrying net resting on it. Men might also use this basket hat when they had a burden to carry. Another covering for the head was woven from rushes; this was used in the same manner as the coiled basket hat.

== Shelters of the Luisenos Indians ==

The primitive house was of a conical form. A circular pit was dug in the earth, perhaps two feet deep. Some crotched poles were then set in the ground with the tops placed together, no king-pole being used. Other smaller poles were then leaned against these and the whole covered with brush so as to shed the rain. An opening was left at one side as an entrance. There was also an opening left at the top for the smoke to escape. When the weather was fine, cooking was performed out of doors; at other times a fire was built in the center of the house. During cool nights a fire was also built in the center, and around this the inmates slept, with their feet towards it. A house built partly underground in this manner requires but little fire to warm it. Sometimes the entrance was through a covered way extending some distance, through which one crawled on hands and knees to enter. In the mountains the poles of the house were covered with cedar bark instead of brush, and on the coast large rushes or sedges were used to cover the pole framework. Often the house was built without any pit, especially if it was only intended for temporary or casual use.

Costanso, in his report of the expedition of 1769, speaks of the Indians of San Diego as living in &quot;shelters of boughs and huts of a pyramidal shape covered with earth,'' and of those of the Santa Barbara channel as having houses &quot;of a spherical form in the fashion of a half orange, covered with rushes, with the hearth in the middle, and in the top of the house a vent or chimney to give exit for the smoke.&quot; As the former of these people lived south and the latter north of the Luiseno and other Shoshonean tribes, much the same style of dwelling seems to have prevailed all along the coast slope of Southern California.


== Plants used for Food and Fiber ==

Maize - corn

Lichens - clothing, kindling

Beans - several varieties

Psorulea esculenta (pomme blanche) - a leguminous plant

Camassia esculenta (camass) - the bulb is about an inch in diameter, mucilaginous, sweetish, and quite nutritious.

Peucedanum farinosum (biscuit-root, couse) - somewhat like a small parsnip.

Apios tuberosa (ground-nut) - at base of stem are tubers which may be eaten.

Helianthus tuberosus (Jerusalem artichoke) - its tubers were used by the Indians of the Mississippi Valley 

Helianthus annuus (sunflower)

Wyethia robusta (Nutt.) - seeds are eaten

Nut-pines - from pinecones

Fruit Of The Cactus

Acorns

Wild rice (Zizania aquatica)

Agave - variety of species

The Sotol (Dasylirion Texanum)- ?

Soap-plants - a subterranean bulb, which is egg-shaped in form, two or three inches in diameter, and enveloped in a thick coating of black, matted, hair-like fibers. This bulb has the detergent properties of soap, cleaning the hands or clothing quite as well as and much more pleasantly than the coarser kinds of soap.

Bbeeies - the Indians are great berry-eaters. During the summer the huckleberries, strawberries, blackberries, etc.

Oregon grape

#:6.25 × 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; electrons are passing through the filament each second. The calculation should be fairly self-evident.
#'''According to the law of gravitation, the gravitational force of attraction between two particles between two particles with masses ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; a distance ''r'' apart is ''Gm''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; / ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''G'', the constant of gravitation has been found by experiment to have the value 0.6673 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt; N m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; kg &lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;; that is, the force of attraction between two particles each with mass 1 kg and the distance 1 m apart is 0.6673 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt; N'''
##'''Calculate the force of electrostatic attraction between an electron and a proton 10 Å apart.'''
##:The appropriate rule to apply here is (the scalar form of) Coulomb's Law. To the reader's ire, Coulomb's law is given using Stoney units, while the charges of electrons and protons are typically given in coulombs. The constant required to calculate the electrostatic force is given later on in the chapter and is 8.9876 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;. That being said, the electrostatic force between the two particles is 8.9876 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; × -1.60217646 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; C × 1.60217646 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; C / (10&lt;sup&gt;-9&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or about -2.30708943 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt; N. Note the sign; it's important. A negative sign implies an attractive force, while a positive sign implies a repulsive force. Because the electron and proton are of opposite polarity, they attract.
##'''Calculate the force of gravitational attraction between an electron and a proton 10 Å apart. What is the relationship of the electrostatic attraction to the gravitational attraction at this distance?'''
##:Here the formula is given directly and is straightforward once the masses are known. The mass of an electron is 9.10938188 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-31&lt;/sup&gt; kg; the mass of a proton, 1.67262158 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-27&lt;/sup&gt; kg. The gravitational attraction then is 1.0167349 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-49&lt;/sup&gt; N, according to the law of gravitation.&lt;ref&gt;This example presents a good opportunity to demonstrate the [http://www.google.com/search?q=%28proton+mass+*+electron+mass+*+gravitational+constant%29+%2F+%28%2810+angstroms%29^2%29 abilities of Google's scientific calculator]&lt;/ref&gt;
##'''What is the dependence on distance of the ratio of electrostatic attraction and gravitational attraction of an electron and proton?'''
##:This question seems vague, but the author appears to be referring to only the ratio of electrostatic and gravitational force given the same 10 Å distance. It is 2.269116 × 10&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;.
#'''Calculate the velocity with which the electrons would move in the apparatus used by J.J. Thomson, operated at an accelerating voltage of 6000 V. Assume that each electron has kinetic energy equal to ''eV'', where ''e'' is the charge of the electron in coulombs and ''V'' is the accelerating potential in volts.'''
#:The kinetic energy of the electron is given by:
#:&lt;math&gt;eV = \frac{1}{2}mv^2&lt;/math&gt;
#:Inserting known values:
#:&lt;math&gt;1.60217646 \cdot 10^{-19} \cdot 6000 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 9.10938188 \cdot 10^{-31} \cdot v^2&lt;/math&gt;
#:Accordingly, the velocity is about 45,941,095 meters per second. ''Is it necessary to use relativity here?''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==4-5==
'''Define isotope, isobar, nuclide, mass number, ''N'', ''A'', ''Z'', the dalton.'''

*Nuclide: either a nucleus with a certain value of ''Z'' and ''A'' (see below) or an atom containing such a nucleus.
*Isotope: a nuclide which shares in common with a different nuclide the same value of ''Z'', but differs in ''N'' (see below)
*Isotone: a nuclide which shares in common with a different nuclide the same value of ''N'', but differs in ''Z'' (see below)
*Isobar: a nuclide which shares in common with a different nuclide the same combined number of protons and neutrons, for example, boron-12 (an exotic radioactive isotope of boron) and carbon-12 (the most common stable form of carbon).
*Mass number: ''same as A?''
*''N'': the number of neutrons in a nuclide
*''Z'': the number of protons in a nuclide, also known as atomic number
*''A'': the sum of neutrons and protons in a nuclide, &lt;math&gt;N + Z&lt;/math&gt;
*Dalton: exactly one-twelfth the mass of a neutral carbon atom&lt;ref&gt;That is to say, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-12 carbon-12].&lt;/ref&gt;, or approximately, 1.66033 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-27&lt;/sup&gt; kg. Used as the standard for atomic mass measurement.

==4-6==
'''What are the atomic number and approximate atomic weight of the element each of whose nuclei contains 81 protons and 122 neutrons? Give the complete symbol for this nuclide, including chemical symbol, atomic number, mass number.'''

The atomic number would be 81; the atomic weight, approximately equal to the sum of protons and neutrons in the nuclide,so what again will work out 203.&lt;ref&gt;In truth, the atomic mass is 204.3833.&lt;/ref&gt; The complete symbol for this nuclide is then &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle ^{203}_{81}\mathrm{Tl}&lt;/math&gt;.

==4-8==
'''An atom of &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr emits a beta ray. What are the atomic number and mass number of the resulting nucleus? What element is it? This nucleus also emits a beta ray. What nucleus does it produce?'''

Because strontium-90 undergoes beta decay, specifically, beta ''minus'' decay, one of its neutrons becomes a proton and a free electron. As such it becomes yttrium-90, with an atomic number of 39, and a mass number of 90. In turn, yttrium-90 undergoes a further beta minus decay, resulting in zirconium-90, with an atomic number of 40, and a mass number of 90.

'''Argon, potassium, and calcium all have nuclides with mass number 40. How many protons and how many neutrons constitute each of the three nuclei?'''

The number of protons in each nuclide is given by the atomic number. Then the neutrons are whatever number is left over. Argon has 18 protons and 22 neutrons; potassium has 19 and 21; and calcium, 20 and 20.

'''What would be the implications of defining Avogadro's number as 1.00000 × 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;? What units would have to be changed?'''

The redefinition of Avogrado's number, arbitrary as it is, would upset a great many chemical formulae. Because atomic mass would no longer be convenient for use with the dalton, which would have to be altered to restore the relationship between moles and atomic mass. ''is it possible to elaborate here?''

'''The molecule of the anesthetic agent nitrous oxide, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, contains two atoms of nitrogen and one atom of oxygen. Using Avogrado's number and the atomic weights of nitrogen and oxygen, calculate the weight in kilograms of one atom of oxygen and that of two atoms of nitrogen. Also calculate the weight of the nitrous oxide molecule. What is the percentage composition by weight of nitrous oxide in terms of nitrogen and oxygen?'''

The atomic weight (or, better said, atomic mass) of oxygen is 15.9994. In other words, a mole of oxygen is 15.9994 g. Dividing this number by Avogadro's constant, the number of molecules of a substance in a mole, or simply ''N'', the mass of an oxygen atom is 2.65676255 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-23&lt;/sup&gt; ''grams''. (Remember units.) So, the mass of an oxygen atom is 2.65676255 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-26&lt;/sup&gt; in kilograms. Through virtually identical calculations, the mass in kilograms of a nitrogen atom is 2.32586697 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-26&lt;/sup&gt;, and of two, it is 4.65173394 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-26&lt;/sup&gt;. The mass of a nitrous oxide molecule is then 7.30849649 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-26&lt;/sup&gt; kg. The percentage (by mass) of oxygen in a quantity of nitrous oxide is then the quotient of the mass of an oxygen atom and the mass of nitrous oxide molecule, approximately 36.35%. Likewise, the percentage by mass of nitrogen in nitrous oxide is approximately 63.65%.

The author informs the reader that the only things that need to be changed are the amounts of each substance. The most general way to do this is through the solution of a system of linear equations. Like most algorithms, the method is best shown by example.

First, assign an unknown variable to each substance in the reaction. For instance:

''w''Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + ''x''C → ''y''Fe + ''z''CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Then, for each element mentioned in the reaction, write a linear equation equating the relative amount of each element on each side and relating the variables given above:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
2w &amp; = &amp; y \\
3w &amp; = &amp; 2z\\
x &amp; = &amp; z
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The equations are written for the balances of iron, oxygen, and carbon, respectively. Taking iron, for example, the appropriate equation is &lt;math&gt;2w = y&lt;/math&gt;, because ferric oxide (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) on the left contains two iron atoms, whereas its product on the right is pure iron. So, for a given amount ''w'' of reactant ferric oxide molecules, there are 2''w'' iron atoms on the left side, which must be equal to the number of iron atoms on the right side, ''y''.

Finally, these equations must be combined into a system of linear equations which is then solved to give the relative amounts of each substance in the reaction&lt;ref&gt;Solution of linear equations by elimination, while incredibly useful, is incredibly dull and error-prone. Computer algebra systems are especially useful for solving problems of these nature; in Maxima, for instance, the reaction Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + C → Fe + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was balanced with &lt;code&gt;linsolve([2*w - y = 0, 3*w - 2*z = 0, x - z = 0], [w,x,y,z]);&lt;/code&gt;. There are even [http://www.webqc.org/balance.php specialized tools on the web for the purpose of balancing reactions].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
2w &amp;   &amp;    &amp; - &amp; y &amp;   &amp;    &amp; = &amp; 0 \\
3w &amp;   &amp;    &amp;   &amp;   &amp; - &amp; 2z &amp; = &amp; 0 \\
   &amp;   &amp;  x &amp;   &amp;   &amp; - &amp;  z &amp; = &amp; 0
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The solution leaves ''z'' free, parameterizing the other variables like so:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
x &amp; = &amp; z \\
w &amp; = &amp; \frac{2}{3}z \\
y &amp; = &amp; \frac{4}{3}z
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Because the reaction coefficients are necessarily integers, let ''z'' equal 3. ''x'' then is three; ''w'', 2; and ''y'', 4. The reaction is 2Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3C → 4Fe + 3CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The remaining reactions, which can be determined in the same manner, are:

*16Ag + S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; →  8Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S
*C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; + 12O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 12CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 11H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
*H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3NaOH → Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
*2Li + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2LiOH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
*2HCl + Ba(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → BaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
*3CuO + 2NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3Cu + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
*N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
*2H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
*2Fe + 3F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2FeF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

'''How much coal (assumed to be pure carbon) is needed to reduce one ton of Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to iron? How much iron is produced?'''

First, notice that the reaction is already given: 2Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3C → 4Fe + 3CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Because the amount of ferric oxide given in the equation is in tons, it is necessary to convert it to grams. &lt;ref&gt;Actually, tons are units of force, and grams units of mass. However, at least on Earth, a gram can reliably be associated with a certain amount force and so related with pounds or other units of force.&lt;/ref&gt; Then there are about 907,184.74 grams of ferric oxide in the reaction. In itself, however, the ''mass'' is not useful for the purposes of this problem. What is needed is the ''number'' of molecules of ferric oxide in the reaction, a number manageable in the form of moles. The atomic mass of ferric oxide is 2 × 55.845 + 3 × 15.9994 = 159.6882. There are then about 5,680.98 moles of ferric oxide in the reaction. The reaction specifies that for every two moles of ferric oxide, there must also be three moles of carbon. So there 8,521.47 moles of carbon are needed, or 8,521.47 × 12.0107 = 102,348.82 g. Note that, although the molar amount of carbon needed for the reaction is greater by half than the amount of ferric oxide, a chemist ordering the coal in Imperial units would ask for a little more than 225 pounds, due to the lower molar mass of coal.

'''Exactly what is meant by the statement that the atomic weight of samarium is 150.33?'''

In the broadest sense, this means that that the average mass of naturally occurring samarium atoms is 150.33 daltons (see above), as the mass of an individual samarium atom varies according to its isotope. Specifically, this number is the sum of the masses of the 62 protons, 88 electrons, and (to a much lesser extent) the 62 electrons in the average samarium atom.

Hi, I've moved some of these pages around. It is the normal naming convention here to name subpages like this &lt;nowiki&gt;[[GNU Autoconf/Page 1]] than to give them different names. This allows the book to automatically structure itself (you'll see links appear to return you to the main page on each subpage). Also, there's no need to omit spaces between words in the page names, so I've added some to make them more readable. If you look at the&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[GNU Autoconf]] page you'll be able to see how to reference the subpages relatively from the main page. Hope this helps. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual?

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=


Fatigue of welded joints is well in line with previously presented material on fatigue analysis, in the sense that it is a complex and local phenomena.  

There are however both local and global approaches to assess the fatigue life of welded joints.  Among the more famous local approaches are the ''Hot-spot stress method'', ''Notch stress method'' and ''Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM)''.  What ought to be the most commonly used method, the ''Nominal stress method'', is a global method, although it is designed to indirectly account for the local effects.

These methods vary significantly regarding the accuracy they provide and the work effort they require.  Below is a list where the methods are presented in order of increasing accuracy and work effort:

# [[#Nominal Stress Method|&lt;u&gt;Nominal Stress Method&lt;/u&gt;]]
# [[#Hot-Spot Stress Method|&lt;u&gt;Hot-Spot Stress Method&lt;/u&gt;]]
# [[#Effective Notch Stress Method|&lt;u&gt;Effective Notch Stress Method&lt;/u&gt;]]
# Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics  

The three first methods are essentially based on common grounds, they only differ in how their features are emphasized.  They all rely on reference empirical data, a measure of stress and the Basquin relation.  The nominal method utilizes vast amounts of experimental reference material and a very coarse and limited measure of stress; and can be considered having a low abstraction level.  The opposite extreme is the effective notch method which relies on a very concise empirical foundation and a very detailed and general stress measure.  The linear elastic fracture mechanics method has an even greater abstraction level, but is essentially different than the other three methods. 

Before we discuss these analysis methods any further, let us consider some important geometrical aspects of welded joints.  

==Global Geometrical Factors==

'''Need illustrations here'''

==Local Geometrical Factors==

'''Need illustrations here'''

=Nominal Stress Method=
The nominal stress method is a non-local fatigue assessment method.  It is based on the notion that the fatigue life of a welded joint can be sufficiently specified by the characteristic global geometry of the joint and the history of [[#Nominal Stress|&lt;u&gt;nominal stresses&lt;/u&gt;]] at specified locations.

The characteristic global geometry of the joint is specified by a ''design category'' and one or several corresponding ''detail category numbers'', see [[../The Wöhler Curve and Basquin Relation|&lt;u&gt;The Wöhler Curve and Basquin Relation&lt;/u&gt;]].

==Hot-Spot Stress Method==
The Hot-spot method is based on detail categories and detail category numbers, -very much in the same sense as the [[#Nominal Stress Method|&lt;u&gt;nominal stress method&lt;/u&gt;]] is.  The only difference is that the hot-spot method incorporates the more competent measure [[#Geometrical Stress|&lt;u&gt;geometrical stress&lt;/u&gt;]], as opposed to the more limited measure [[#Nominal Stress|&lt;u&gt;nominal stress&lt;/u&gt;]].  As a Consequence, the hot-spot approach require fewer detail categories than the nominal stress in order to provide comparable versatility.

At present, there are only two applied [[#Detail Category Numbers|&lt;u&gt;detail category numbers&lt;/u&gt;]]: FAT100 MPa and FAT90 MPa.
  
==Geometrical Stress==
''Geometrical stress'' (also called ''structural stress'') is defined as the summation of all stress rising effects except the notch effects of the weld.  The concept is valid for linear-elastic models.  The adopted mathematical &quot;definition&quot; is represented by the following to equations:  
 

&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_{hs} = 1.67 \sigma_{0.4t} - 0.67 \sigma_{1.0t}
&lt;/math&gt;     (linear extrapolation)


or


&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_{hs} = 2.52 \sigma_{0.4t} - 2.24 \sigma_{0.9t} + 0.72 \sigma_{1.4t}
&lt;/math&gt;     (quadratic extrapolation)


Where &lt;math&gt; \sigma_{0.4t}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{0.67t}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{0.72t} &lt;/math&gt; etc. refer to the stress at the distances &lt;math&gt; 0.4t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0.67t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0.72t &lt;/math&gt; etc., from the hot-spot.  The factor &lt;math&gt; t &lt;/math&gt; represents the thickness of the parent material.

Linear extrapolation is suitable when present bending is low or the mesh is coarse (element size in the order of &lt;math&gt; &gt;0.2t &lt;/math&gt;).  Quadratic extrapolation should be used in other cases.

==Effective Notch Stress Method==
The ''effective notch stress method'' represents a very generalized view of welds subjected to fatigue loads.  The stress measure is defined as the local maximum stress in linear-elastic weld models where the true notches have been substituted by fictitious notches of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.  This stress measure reflects the local effects very well and in a scalable manner.  As a result only one detail category is necessary for a general analysis.

The value of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is:

* &lt;math&gt;r = 1&lt;/math&gt; mm for parent material thickness greater than 5 mm
* &lt;math&gt;r = 0.05&lt;/math&gt; mm for parent material thickness smaller than 5 mm
  
The FAT = 240 MPa yields 97.7% survivor probability at &lt;math&gt;2 \cdot 10^6&lt;/math&gt; cycles.

&lt;big&gt;'''Lung Cancer Staging'''&lt;/big&gt;

'''AJCC 7th Edition (2009)'''
*corresponds with IASLC staging - published: PMID 19584208 (Chest 2009 Jul;136(1):260-71.)
*[http://www.iaslc.org/staging_project.asp IASLC document (PDF)]

&lt;br&gt;''Primary Tumor:''
*T1 - 3 cm or less, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, not invading into a main bronchus
**T1a - tumor 2 cm or less
**T1b - &gt; 2 cm but &lt;= 3 cm
*T2 - tumor &gt;3 cm but &lt;= 7 cm; or tumor with any of the following: involves main bronchus (2cm or more distal to the carina), invades visceral pleura; associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region but does not involve the entire lung
**T2a - &gt;3 cm but &lt;= 5 cm (also includes T2 tumors smaller than 3 cm)
**T2b - &gt;5 cm but &lt;= 7 cm
*T3 - tumor &gt; 7 cm; or tumor that directly invades one of the following: parietal pleura, chest wall, diaphragm, phrenic nerve, mediastinal pleura, parietal pericardium; or tumor in the main bronchus less than 2 cm distal to the carina; or associated atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis of the entire lung; or separate tumor nodules in the same lobe
*T4 - tumor invades: mediastinum, heart, great vessels, trachea, recurrent laryngeal nerve, esophagus, vertebral body, carina; or separate tumor nodule(s) in a different ipsilateral lobe


''Regional Lymph Nodes:''
*N0 - no nodes
*N1 - ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes or intrapulmonary nodes
*N2 - ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal nodes
*N3 - contralateral mediastinal, contralateral hilar, ipsilateral or contralateral scalene or supraclavicular nodes


''Distant Metastases:''
*M0 - none
*M1
**M1a - separate tumor nodule(s) in a contralateral lobe; tumor with pleural nodules or malignant pleural or pericardial effusion
**M1b - distant metastases


''Stage Grouping:''
*IA - T1(a or b) N0
*IB - T2a N0
*IIA - T1(a or b) N1, T2a N1, T2b N0
*IIB - T2b N1, T3 N0
*IIIA - T3 N1, T1-3 N2, T4 N0-1
*IIIB - N3 any, T4 N2-3
*IV - M1a or M1b


&lt;br&gt;''Changes from AJCC 6th Edition:'' &lt;br&gt;
Changes in TNM:
*Size: New size classifications (&lt;2, 2-3, 3-5, 5-7, &gt;7). Subclassifications of T1a/b and T2a/b. New size classification separating T2 and T3.
*Separate tumor nodules: (same lobe) now T3 instead of T4. (different ipsilateral lobe) T4 instead of M1. (contralateral lobe) M1a
*Subdivision of M1 into M1a (pleural effusion, tumor nodules in contralateral lobe) and M1b (distant mets)
*some old T2 tumors (&gt;7cm) now classified as T3
*N-stage: no change
Stage grouping changes:
*T2aN1 downstaged to IIA (instead of IIB for old T2N1)
*T2bN0 upstaged to IIA (instead of IB for old T2N0)
*T4N0-N1 downstaged to IIIA (instead of IIIB)
*pleural effusion is now Stage IV (M1a) instead of IIIB (T4)
*separate nodule in same lobe is now T3 (IIB,IIIA,or IIIB) instead of T4(IIIB)
*ipsilateral lung nodule (different lobe) is now T4 (IIIA or IIIB) instead of Stage IV

''Note:''
*The 7th Edition recommended that AJCC staging be applied to Small Cell Lung Cancer and Pulmonary Carcinoid Tumors


==Older staging editions==
'''AJCC 6th Edition (2002)''' &lt;br&gt;

''Primary Tumor:''
*T1 - 3 cm or less, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, not invading into a main bronchus
*T2 - Any of the following: 1) more than 3 cm, 2) involves main bronchus, 2 cm or more distal to the carina, 3) invades the visceral pleura, 4) associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region but does not involve the entire lung
*T3 - Tumor of any size that invades any of the following: 1) chest wall, 2) diaphragm, 3) mediastinal pleura, 4) parietal pericardium; or 5) tumor in the main bronchus less than 2 cm distal to the carina but without involvement of the carina; or 6) associated atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis of the entire lung
*T4 - Tumor of any size that invades any of the following: 
**1) mediastinum, 2) heart, 3) great vessels, 4) trachea, 5) esophagus, 6) vertebral body, or 7) carina;
**8) separate tumor nodules in the same lobe; 
**9) malignant pleural effusion


''Regional Lymph Nodes:''
*N0 - no nodes
*N1 - ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes or intrapulmonary nodes
*N2 - ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal nodes
*N3 - contralateral mediastinal, contralateral hilar, ipsilateral or contralateral scalene or supraclavicular nodes


''Distant Metastases:''
*M0 - no
*M1 - yes
**includes separate tumor nodules in a different lobe (ipsilateral or contralateral)


''Stage Grouping:''
*IA - T1 N0
*IB - T2 N0
*IIA - T1 N1
*IIB - T2 N1, T3 N0
*IIIA - T3 N1, T1-3 N2
*IIIB - N3 or T4
**T4 N0-1 (invasive but potentially resectable; includes upstaged to T4 due to satellite lesions)
**T4 N0-1 (upstaged to T4 because of pleural/pericardial effusion; unresectable)
**T4 N2-3 (invasive and mediastinal+ LNs; unresectable)
**T1-3 N3 (possibly smaller but contralateral LNs; unresectable)
*IV - M1


&lt;br&gt;NOTE: the 1997 AJCC Staging System moved T3,N0 from Stage III to IIB, complicating the interpretation of older trials of Stage III patients which would have had better prognosis.</text>

== Definition ==

Now recall that ''F'' is said to be an antiderivative of ''f'' if &lt;math&gt; F'(x) = f(x)\,.&lt;/math&gt;.  However, ''F'' is not the only antiderivative.  We can add any constant to ''F'' without changing the derivative.  With this, we define the '''indefinite integral''' as follows:

{{Calculus/Def|text= &lt;math&gt;\int f(x) dx = F(x) + C \;\;\;&lt;/math&gt; where ''F'' satisfies &lt;math&gt;F'(x) = f(x)\;&lt;/math&gt; and ''C'' is any constant.}}

The function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, the function being integrated, is known as the '''integrand'''.  Note that the indefinite integral yields a ''family'' of functions.

'''Example'''

Since the derivative of &lt;math&gt;x^4&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;4x^3&lt;/math&gt;, the general antiderivative of &lt;math&gt;4x^3&lt;/math&gt;  is &lt;math&gt;x^4&lt;/math&gt; plus a constant.  Thus,
:&lt;math&gt; \int 4x^3 dx = x^4 + C.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example: Finding antiderivatives'''

Let's take a look at &lt;math&gt;6x^2&lt;/math&gt;. How would we go about finding the integral of this function? Recall the rule from differentiation that
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} x^n = n x^{n-1}\ &lt;/math&gt;
In our circumstance, we have:
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} x^3  = 3 x^2\ &lt;/math&gt;
This is a start! We now know that the function we seek will have a power of 3 in  it. How would we get the constant of 6? Well,
: &lt;math&gt; 2 \frac{d}{dx} x^3= 2 \times 3 x^2 =6x^2.\ &lt;/math&gt; 

Thus, we say that &lt;math&gt;2x^3&lt;/math&gt; is an antiderivative of &lt;math&gt;6x^2&lt;/math&gt;.

== Indefinite integral identities ==

=== Basic Properties of Indefinite Integrals ===

{{Calculus/Def|text= '''Constant Rule for indefinite integrals'''&lt;br/&gt;
If ''c'' is a constant then &lt;math&gt; \int c f(x) dx = c \int f(x) dx.&lt;/math&gt;}}

{{Calculus/Def|text= '''Sum/Difference Rule for indefinite integrals'''&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \int (f(x) + g(x)) dx = \int f(x) dx + \int g(x) dx.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \int (f(x) - g(x)) dx = \int f(x) dx - \int g(x) dx.&lt;/math&gt;}}

=== Indefinite integrals of Polynomials ===
Say we are given a function of the form, &lt;math&gt; f(x)= x^n &lt;/math&gt;, and would like to determine the antiderivative of ''f''.  Considering that
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} \frac{1}{n+1}x^{n+1} = x^{n} &lt;/math&gt;
we have the following rule for indefinite integrals:

{{Calculus/Def|text= '''Power rule for indefinite integrals''' 
&lt;math&gt; \int x^n {dx}= \frac{1}{n+1} x^{n+1} +C \; &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; n \not= -1. &lt;/math&gt;}}

=== Integral of the Inverse function ===
To integrate &lt;math&gt; f(x)=\frac{1}{x} &lt;/math&gt;, we should first remember
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} \ln x = \frac{1}{x}. &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, since &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the derivative of &lt;math&gt;\ln(x) &lt;/math&gt; we can conclude that

{{Calculus/Def|text= &lt;math&gt;\int \frac{dx}{x} = \ln \left| x \right| +C.&lt;/math&gt;}}

Note that the polynomial integration rule does not apply when the exponent is -1.  This technique of integration must be used instead.  Since the argument of the natural logarithm function must be positive (on the real line), the absolute value signs are added around its argument to ensure that the argument is positive.

=== Integral of the Exponential function ===
Since 
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} e^x= e^x&lt;/math&gt; 
we see that &lt;math&gt;e^x&lt;/math&gt; is its own antiderivative.  This allows us to find the integral of an exponential function:
{{Calculus/Def|text= &lt;math&gt; \int e^x dx = e^x + C. &lt;/math&gt;}}

=== Integral of Sine and Cosine ===

Recall that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\sin{x}= \cos{x} \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\cos{x}= -\sin{x}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

So ''sin x'' is an antiderivative of ''cos x'' and ''-cos x'' is an antiderivative of ''sin x''.  Hence we get the following rules for integrating ''sin x'' and ''cos x''

{{Calculus/Def|text= &lt;math&gt;\int \cos{x}\ dx= \sin{x} +C&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/br&gt; &lt;math&gt;\int \sin{x}\ dx= -\cos{x} + C.&lt;/math&gt;}}

We will find how to integrate more complicated trigonometric functions in the chapter on [[Calculus/Integration techniques|integration techniques]].

'''Example'''

Suppose we want to integrate the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^4+1+2\sin{x}&lt;/math&gt;.  An application of the sum rule from above allows us to use the power rule and our rule for integrating &lt;math&gt;\sin{x}&lt;/math&gt; as follows,
:&lt;math&gt; \int f(x)\,dx  = \int x^4 + 1 + 2\sin{x}\,dx &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = \int x^4dx + \int 1\,dx + \int 2\sin{x}\,dx &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = \frac{x^5}{5} + x - 2\cos{x} + C. &lt;/math&gt;

{{noprint|[[Calculus/Indefinite_integral/Solutions|Solutions]]}}

==The Substitution Rule==
The substitution rule is a valuable asset in the toolbox of any integration greasemonkey.  It is essentially the chain rule (a differentiation technique you should be familiar with) in reverse.  First, let's take a look at an example:
===Preliminary Example===
Suppose we want to find &lt;math&gt;\int x \cos(x^2) dx&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, we want to find a function such that its derivative equals &lt;math&gt; x \, \cos(x^2)&lt;/math&gt;.  Stated yet another way, we want to find an antiderivative of &lt;math&gt; f(x)= x \, \cos (x^2)&lt;/math&gt;.  Since &lt;math&gt;\sin(x)&lt;/math&gt; differentiates to &lt;math&gt;\cos(x)&lt;/math&gt;, as a first guess we might try the function &lt;math&gt;\sin (x^2)&lt;/math&gt;.  But by the Chain Rule,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} \sin (x^2) = \cos(x^2) \cdot \frac{d}{dx} x^2 = \cos(x^2) \cdot 2x = 2x \cos(x^2).&lt;/math&gt;

Which is almost what we want apart from the fact that there is an extra factor of 2 in front.  But this is easily dealt with because we can divide by a constant (in this case 2).  So,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}\frac{\sin (x^2)}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{d}{dx} \sin (x^2) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \cos(x^2)x=x \cos(x^2)=f(x).&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, we have discovered a function, &lt;math&gt; F(x) = \frac{\sin (x^2)}{2} &lt;/math&gt;, whose derivative is &lt;math&gt; x \, \cos (x^2)&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, ''F'' is an antiderivative of &lt;math&gt; f(x)= x \, \cos (x^2)&lt;/math&gt;.  This gives us

:&lt;math&gt; \int x \cos(x^2) dx = \frac{\sin(x^2)}{2} + C.&lt;/math&gt;

===Generalization===
In fact, this technique will work for more general integrands.  Suppose ''u'' is a differentiable function. Then to evaluate &lt;math&gt; \int u'(x) \cos(u(x)) dx&lt;/math&gt; we just have to notice that by the Chain Rule
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} \sin(u(x)) = \cos(u(x)) \frac{du}{dx} = u'(x) \cos(u(x)).&lt;/math&gt;
As long as &lt;math&gt;u'&lt;/math&gt; is continuous we have that
:&lt;math&gt;\int \cos(u(x)) u'(x) dx = \sin(u(x)) + C.&lt;/math&gt;
Now the right hand side of this equation is just the integral of &lt;math&gt;\cos(u)&lt;/math&gt; but with respect to ''u''.  If we write ''u'' instead of ''u(x)'' this becomes
&lt;math&gt;\int \cos(u(x)) u'(x) dx = \sin(u) du + C = \int \cos(u) du.&lt;/math&gt;

So, for instance, if &lt;math&gt;u(x) = x^3&lt;/math&gt; we have worked out that
:&lt;math&gt;\int (\cos(x^3)\cdot 3x^2)dx = \sin(x^3) + C.&lt;/math&gt;

===General Substitution Rule===
Now there was nothing special about using the cosine function in the discussion above, and it could be replaced by any other function.  Doing this gives us the substitution rule for indefinite integrals:

{{Calculus/Def|text= '''Substitution rule for indefinite integrals'''  &lt;/br&gt;
Assume  ''u'' is differentiable with continuous derivative and that ''f'' is continuous on the range of ''u''.  Then
&lt;math&gt;\int f(u(x)) \frac{du}{dx} dx = \int f(u) du.&lt;/math&gt;}}

Notice that it looks like you can &quot;cancel&quot; in the expression &lt;math&gt;\frac{du}{dx} dx&lt;/math&gt; to leave just a &lt;math&gt;du&lt;/math&gt;.  This does not really make any sense because &lt;math&gt;\frac{du}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; is '''not a fraction'''.  But it's a good way to remember the substitution rule.

===Examples===
The following example shows how powerful a technique substitution can be.  At first glance the following integral seems intractable, but after a little simplification, it's possible to tackle using substitution.  

'''Example'''  

We will show that
:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{1}{\left(x^2+a^2\right)^{3/2}}\,dx = \frac{x}{a^2 \sqrt{x^2+a^2}} + C&lt;/math&gt;

First, we re-write the integral:

:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1}{\left(x^2+a^2\right)^{3/2}}\,dx = \int \left(x^2 + a^2\right)^{-3/2}\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= \int \left(x^2 \left(1 + \frac{a^2}{x^2}\right) \right)^{-3/2} dx&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= \int x^{-3} \left(1+\frac{a^2}{x^2}\right)^{-3/2} dx&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= \int \left(1+\frac{a^2}{x^2}\right)^{-3/2} \left(x^{-3} dx\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Now we preform the following substitution:

:&lt;math&gt; u = 1 + \frac{a^2}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{du}{dx} = -2a^2x^{-3} \Longrightarrow  x^{-3}dx = -\frac{du}{2a^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Which yields:

:&lt;math&gt;\int \left(1+\frac{a^2}{x^2}\right)^{-3/2} \left(x^{-3} dx\right) =&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= \int u^{-3/2} \left(-\frac{du}{2a^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= -\frac{1}{2a^2} \int u^{-3/2} du&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= -\frac{1}{2a^2} \left(-\frac{2}{\sqrt{u}}\right) + C&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= \frac{1}{a^2 \sqrt{1+\frac{a^2}{x^2}}} + C&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= \left(\frac{x}{x}\right) \frac{1}{a^2 \sqrt{1+\frac{a^2}{x^2}}} + C&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= \frac{x}{a^2 \sqrt{x^2+a^2}} + C&lt;/math&gt;.

===Exercises===

{{noprint|[[Calculus/Indefinite integral/Solutions|Solutions]]}}

==Integration by Parts==
Integration by parts is another powerful tool for integration.  It was mentioned above that one could consider integration by substitution as an application of the chain rule in reverse.  In a similar manner, one may consider integration by parts as the product rule in reverse.

===Preliminary Example===

===General Integration by Parts===
{{Calculus/Def|text= '''Integration by parts for indefinite integrals'''  &lt;/br&gt;
Suppose ''f'' and ''g'' are differentiable and their derivatives are continuous.  Then 
:&lt;math&gt;\int f(x)g'(x) dx = f(x)g(x) - \int f'(x) g(x) dx.&lt;/math&gt;}}

If we write ''u=f(x)'' and ''v=g(x)'', then by using the Leibniz notation ''du=f'(x) dx'' and ''dv=g'(x) dx'' the integration by parts rule becomes

{{Calculus/Def|text= &lt;math&gt;\int u dv = uv - \int v du.&lt;/math&gt;}}

===Examples===
'''Example''' 

Find &lt;math&gt;\int x\cos (x) \,dx .&lt;/math&gt;

Here we let:

:&lt;math&gt;u = x&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;du = dx&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;dv = \cos(x)dx&lt;/math&gt; , so that &lt;math&gt;v = \sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

Then:

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\int x\cos (x) \,dx &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \int u \,dv &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= uv - \int v \,du&lt;/math&gt;
|}
:&lt;math&gt;\int x\cos (x) \,dx = x\sin (x) - \int \sin (x) \,dx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int x\cos (x) \,dx = x\sin (x) + \cos (x) + C.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example''' 

Find &lt;math&gt;\int x^2 e^x\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

In this example we will have to use integration by parts twice.

Here we let
:&lt;math&gt;u = x^2&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;du= 2x dx&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;dv= e^xdx&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;v =e^x&lt;/math&gt;.

Then:

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\int x^2e^x \,dx &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \int u \,dv &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= uv - \int v \,du&lt;/math&gt;
|}
:&lt;math&gt;\int x^2e^x \,dx = x^2e^x - \int 2xe^x\,dx= x^2 e^x - 2\int xe^x\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Now to calculate the last integral we use integration by parts again.  Let
:&lt;math&gt;u = ''x&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;du=  dx&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;dv= e^xdx&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;v =e^x&lt;/math&gt;
and integrating by parts gives
:&lt;math&gt;\int xe^x \,dx = xe^x - \int e^x\,dx= x e^x - e^x.&lt;/math&gt;
So, finally we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\int x^2e^x \,dx =  x^2 e^x - 2(x e^x - e^x)+ C = x^2 e^x - 2x e^x + 2e^x + C =e^x(x^2-2x+2) + C.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example''' 

Find &lt;math&gt;\int \ln (x) \,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

The trick here is to write this integral as
:&lt;math&gt;\int \ln (x) \cdot 1 \,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Now let

:&lt;math&gt;u = \ln(x)&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;du = (1/x) dx&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;v = x&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;dv = 1dx&lt;/math&gt;.

Then using integration by parts,

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\int \ln (x) \,dx &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= x \ln (x) - \int \frac{x}{x} \,dx &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= x \ln (x) - \int 1 \,dx&lt;/math&gt;
|}
:&lt;math&gt;\int \ln (x) \,dx = x \ln (x) - {x} + {C}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int \ln (x) \,dx = x ( \ln (x) - 1 ) + C.&lt;/math&gt; 

'''Example'''

Find &lt;math&gt;\int \arctan(x) dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Again the trick here is to write the integrand as &lt;math&gt;\arctan(x) = \arctan(x) \cdot 1 &lt;/math&gt;.  Then let
:''u'' = arctan(''x''); d''u'' = 1/(1+''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) d''x''
:''v'' = ''x''; d''v'' = 1&amp;middot;d''x''
so using integration by parts,
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\int \arctan (x) \,dx &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= x \arctan (x) - \int \frac{x}{1 + x^2} \,dx &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= x \arctan (x) - {1 \over 2} \ln \left( 1 + x^2 \right) + C.&lt;/math&gt;
|}

'''Example'''

Find &lt;math&gt;\int e^{x} \cos (x) \,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

This example uses integration by parts twice. First let,

:''u'' = e&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;; thus d''u'' = e&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;d''x''
:d''v'' = cos(''x'')d''x''; thus ''v'' = sin(''x'')
so
:&lt;math&gt;\int e^{x} \cos (x) \,dx = e^{x} \sin (x) - \int e^{x} \sin (x) \,dx&lt;/math&gt;

Now, to evaluate the remaining integral, we use integration by parts again, with

:''u'' = e&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;; d''u'' = e&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;d''x''
:''v'' = -cos(''x''); d''v'' = sin(''x'')d''x''

Then

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\int e^{x} \sin (x) \,dx &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= -e^{x} \cos (x) - \int -e^{x} \cos (x) \,dx &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= -e^{x} \cos (x) + \int e^{x} \cos (x) \,dx&lt;/math&gt;
|}
Putting these together, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\int e^{x} \cos (x) \,dx = e^{x} \sin (x) + e^x \cos (x) - \int e^{x} \cos (x) \,dx&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the same integral shows up on both sides of this equation, but with opposite signs. The integral does not cancel; it doubles when we add the integral to both sides to get

:&lt;math&gt;2\int e^{x} \cos (x) \,dx = e^{x} ( \sin (x) + \cos (x) )&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Outlier detection is one of the most important tasks in data analysis. In this approach, an expert can explore a set of associative rules in order to find how much the interestingness measure of these rules are away from their average values in different subsets of the database. The threshold which divides abnormal and non-abnormal data numerically is often the basis for important decisions. Most of the methods for univariate outlier detection are based on (robust) estimation of location and scatter or on quantiles of the data. A major disadvantage is that these rules are independent from the sample size. The dependence from the sample size is desirable to allow the threshold to be fitted according to the sample size. Moreover, outliers are identified even for “clean” data, or at least no distinction is made between outliers and extremes of a distribution.


== Algorithm ==

Discovery methods for interesting exception rules can be divided into two approaches from the viewpoint of background knowledge:

# In a directed approach, a method is first provided with background knowledge typically in the form of rules, then the method obtains exception rules each of which deviates from these rules;
# In an undirected approach, on the other hand, no background knowledge is provided.

The problem can be summarized as finding a set of rule pairs each of which consists of an exception rule associated with a strong rule. Suppose a strong rule is represented by ''if Y then x&quot;'', where ''Y = y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ^ y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ^ ... ^ y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a conjunction of atoms and ''x'' is a single atom. Let ''Z = z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ^ z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ^ ... ^ z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' be a conjunction of atoms and ''x''' be a single atom which has the same attribute but a value different to the atom ''x'', then the exception rule is represented by ''if Y and Z then x&quot;''. For instance, consider the rule &quot;using a seat belt is risky for a child&quot;, which represents exceptions to the well-known fact &quot;using a seat belt is safe&quot;.



== Package Installation ==

* Step1: If you already have the R package installed in your system jump to Step2. To install the R package you can use your system apt-get capabilities, just typing the following command:

  $ sudo apt-get install r-base-core

If your system does not have apt-get capabilities, don't give up! You can download the package by visiting the [http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mvoutlier/index.html Outlier Package] website.

* Step2: It is necessary to install the mvoutlier package. In order to install the mvoutlier package you first need to run R. It can be done by the command:

  $ R

Then type the following command in the R environment:

  &gt; install.packages(&quot;mvoutlier&quot;)

The installation is done.

Now it is necessary to load the package:

  &gt; library(mvoutlier)

== Visualization ==

In order to show how we can visualize the results of the mvoutlier package, we will use a practical example. The data set and its use in mvoutlier are described below.

=== Swiss Fertility and Socioeconomic Indicators (1888) Data ===

[http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/swiss.html Swiss] is a database that contains standardized fertility measure and socio-economic indicators for each of 47 French-speaking provinces of Switzerland at about 1888.

'''Format'''

A data frame with 47 observations on 6 variables, each of which is in percent.

&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Fertility&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;Ig, ‘common standardized fertility measure’&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Agriculture&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;% of males involved in agriculture as occupation&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Examination&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;% draftees receiving highest mark on army examination&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Education&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;% education beyond primary school for draftees.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Catholic&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;% &quot;catholic&quot; (as opposed to &quot;protestant&quot;).&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Infant.Mortality&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;live births who live less than 1 year.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

All variables but &quot;Fertility&quot; give proportions of the population.

To find the outliers of this dataset just type these two commands below:

  &gt; data(swiss)
  &gt; uni.plot(swiss)

The above commands will generate the following figure:

[[Image:Exemplo1_1.jpg]]


The exceptions are found by analyzing the correlation among each feature represented by the columns. For example, the red points next to the value 0 would not be outliers if they were analyzed separately, but as the correlation is considered the points are outliers. Also it is important to point out that the outliers from a column are the same in the others. 

The y-axis represents the robust Mahalanobis distance based on the mcd estimator. The zero point indicates the statistical average of the values. 


A more detailed output can be reached with the following commands:

  &gt; data(swiss)
  &gt; uni.plot(swiss, symb=TRUE)

[[Image:Rguidolini_exemplo1_2_r_outliers.jpg]]

In the first picture there are only two colors and no special symbols are used. Outliers are marked red.

In the second picture we have set  the argument symbol TRUE. In this case, different symbols (cross means big value, circle means little value) according to the robust [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance Mahalanobis] distance based on the mcd estimator and different colors (red means big value, blue means little value) according to the euclidean distances of the observations are used.


Besides highlight the outliers in the figure, a table is generated to identify which elements correspond to the outliers highlighted. In this table, the elements marked as TRUE are the outliers. An example of this table is shown in the Section [[#Case_Study]] .

== Case Study ==

=== Scenario ===

Suppose you want to buy an antique car, because you're a famous collector. You have a list with many characteristics of each car.

A car that stands out would be a good idea, but a car that &quot;stands out&quot; can be very good or very bad. So which car to buy?

=== Input Data ===

==== Description ====

The dataset that we are going to use in this case study, called [http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html mtcars], was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models).

==== Format ====

A data frame with 32 observations on 11 variables.

&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;mpg&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;Miles/(US) gallon&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;cyl&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;Number of cylinders&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;disp&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;Displacement (cu.in.)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;hp&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;Gross horsepower&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;drat&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;Rear axle ratio&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;wt&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;Weight (lb/1000)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;qsec&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;1/4 mile time&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;vs&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;V/S&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;am&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;gear&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;Number of forward gears&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;carb&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;Number of carburetors&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

As a collector, you are only interested in three characteristics: ''mpg'', ''qseq'' and ''hp''.
So a filter need to be done in the dataset. Moreover, you are only interested in the first 15 cars of the list,
because you already have the others :)


===== Filtered Dataset =====

[[Image:outliers_car_data.jpg]]

=== Execution ===

Loading the dataset:

  &gt; data(mtcars)

Filtering the dataset:

  &gt; cars = mtcars[1:15, c(&quot;mpg&quot;, &quot;qsec&quot;, &quot;hp&quot;)]

To see what we have filtered:

  &gt; cars

Finding the stands out cars:

  &gt; uni.plot(log(cars))

The &quot;log&quot; in the above command is used to put y-axis in logarithmic scale.

=== Results ===

'''mvoutlier Graphic''':

[[Image:Cars.jpg]]


'''mvoutlier Tables:'''

[[Image:outliers_info.jpg]]

=== Analysis ===

The first figure shows us that we have two outliers, i.e., two cars that stands out. In the figure, these cars are represented by the red points. The outliers in a column are the same in the others.

It is worth noting that exceptions are found by analyzing the correlation among each feature of the car. For example, the red dot next to the value 0 in column qsec would not be an outlier if it were analyzed separately, but as the correlation is considered the point is an outlier.

To find out the cars that stands out we analyze the second figure. Clearly we can see the outliers marked as TRUE. So the outliers are Merc 230 and Cadillac Fleetwood. Now the collector life is easier. It only remains to identify what kind of &quot;stand out&quot; the collector is interested. Looking the [[#Filtered Dataset]], we can note that the car Merc 230 is very economical, but slower and less powerful and we can see too that the Cadillac Fleetwood is very fast and powerful, but consume too much fuel. As a good collector, he will likely choose the Cadillac Fleetwood, because it was probably the most desired car.


Congratulations!!! You have just bought this amazing car!!!

      <comment>/* Singular Value Decomposition */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In this chapter we will take a look at Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a
matrix's factorization method that uses the knowledge of [[w:Linear
Algebra|Linear Algebra]] in order to make such decompositions.

==Singular Value Decomposition==

In data mining, this algorithm can be used to better understand a database by
showing the number of important dimensions and also to simplify it, by reducing
of the number of attributes that are used in a data mining process. This
reduction removes unnecessary data that are linearly dependent in the point of
view of Linear Algebra. For example, imagine a database which contains a field
that stores the water's temperature on several samples and another that stores
its state (solid,liquid or gas). Its easy to see that the second field is
dependent from the first and, therefore, SVD could easily show us that it is
not important for the analysis.

[[Data Mining Algorithms In R/Dimensionality Reduction/Principal Component Analysis|Principal Component Analysis]] (PCA) is a specific case of SVD.

===Algorithm===
SVD is the factorization of a matrix &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of real or complex numbers, that has &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; rows and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; columns, into:

&lt;math&gt;X = UAV^\top&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a matrix whose dimensions are &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is another matrix whose dimensions are &lt;math&gt;d \times d&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a matrix whose dimensions are &lt;math&gt;n \times d&lt;/math&gt;, the same dimensions as &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

Besides:

&lt;math&gt;U^\top U = I_n&lt;/math&gt;  and  &lt;math&gt;V^\top V = I_d&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_d&lt;/math&gt; are Identity matrix whose size are respectively &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

The columns of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; are the '''left singular vectors''' of the matrix &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and the columns of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; (or the rows of &lt;math&gt;V^\top&lt;/math&gt;) are the '''right singular vectors'''.

The matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a diagonal matrix, whose diagonal values are the '''singular values''' of the matrix &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. The singular value in a row of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is never less than the value of a row below. All singular values are greater than &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

To compute the SVD is to find the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of &lt;math&gt;XX^\top&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X^\top X&lt;/math&gt;. The eigenvectors of &lt;math&gt;X^\top X&lt;/math&gt; are the columns of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and the eigenvectors of &lt;math&gt;XX^\top&lt;/math&gt; are the columns of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;. The singular values of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, in the diagonal of matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, are the square root of the common positive eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;XX^\top&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X^\top X&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;XX^\top&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X^\top X&lt;/math&gt; have he same number of eigenvalues, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a square matrix; else, the eigenvalues of the matrix that has less eigenvalues are eigenvalues of the matrix that has more eigenvalues. Therefore, the singular values of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; are the eigenvalues of the matrix, between &lt;math&gt;XX^\top&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X^\top X&lt;/math&gt;, that has less eigenvalues.

The number of singular values of a matrix is the rank of that matrix, that is the number of linearly independent columns or rows of a matrix. The rank is not greater than &lt;math&gt;\min(n, d)&lt;/math&gt;, because this is the number of elements of the diagonal of the matrix. The singular values are elements of the diagonal of the matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. The number of positive singular values equals the rank of the matrix.

Therefore, the algorithm is:

# Compute &lt;math&gt;XX^\top&lt;/math&gt; normally.
# Compute the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of &lt;math&gt;XX^\top&lt;/math&gt; normally.
# Compute &lt;math&gt;X^\top X&lt;/math&gt;.
# Compute the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of &lt;math&gt;X^\top X&lt;/math&gt;.
# Compute the square root of the common positive eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;XX^\top&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X^\top X&lt;/math&gt;.
# Finally, assign the computed values to &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

===Example===
X = &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 2\\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 0\\
2 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;


XX&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; = &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
6 &amp; 2 &amp; 4\\
2 &amp; 6 &amp; 4\\
4 &amp; 4 &amp; 6
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The eigenvalues of XX&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; are:
:12.744563, 4.000000, and 1.255437

The eigenvectors of XX&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; are:
# 0.5417743,  0.5417743,  0.6426206
# 0.7071068, -0.7071068, -2.144010 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-16&lt;/sup&gt;
# 0.4544013,  0.4544013, -0.7661846

X&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;X = &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
6 &amp; 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 4\\
2 &amp; 2 &amp; 2 &amp; 2\\
4 &amp; 2 &amp; 5 &amp; 1\\
4 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 5
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The eigenvalues of X&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;X are:
:12.744563, 4.000000, 1.255437, and (5.940557 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-18&lt;/sup&gt;)

The eigenvectors of X&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;X are:
# 0.6635353, 0.3035190,  0.4835272,  0.4835272
# 0.0000000, 0.5181041 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-16&lt;/sup&gt;, -0.7071068,  0.7071068
#-0.5565257, 0.8110957,  0.1272850,  0.1272850
# 0.5000000, 0.5000000, -0.5000000, -0.5000000

The singular values of X are the square root of the common eigenvalues of X&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;X and XX&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; \sqrt{12.744563} = 3.569953&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \sqrt{4.000000} = 2.000000&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \sqrt{1.255437} = 1.120463&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

A = &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
3.569953 &amp; 0        &amp; 0        &amp; 0\\
0        &amp; 2.000000 &amp; 0        &amp; 0\\
0        &amp; 0        &amp; 1.120463 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, X is decomposed:

X = UAV&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; = &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
0.5417743 &amp;  0.7071068 &amp;  0.4544013\\
0.5417743 &amp; -0.7071068 &amp;  0.4544013\\
0.6426206 &amp; -2.144010\cdot10^{-16} &amp; -0.7661846
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
3.569953 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 2.000000 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1.120463 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
0.6635353 &amp;  0.000000 &amp;  -0.5565257 &amp;  0.5\\
0.3035190 &amp;  5.181041\cdot10^{-16} &amp;  0.8110957 &amp;  0.5\\
0.4835272 &amp; -0.7071068 &amp;  0.1272850 &amp; -0.5\\
0.4835272 &amp;  0.7071068 &amp;  0.1272850 &amp; -0.5
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Implementation==

R has a built in function which calculates SVD, called 'svd()'.

It, by default, receives a R's [[R Programming/Data types#Matrix|native matrix]]
as argument and returns an [[R Programming/Data types#Data Frames|frame]], that contains U, A
and V.

===Arguments===

If it is not necessary the computation of all singular values and vectors, one can
tell svd() the exactly number of needed elements.

It can be achieve by assign this values to '''nu''' and '''nv''' which represents the number
of left and right singular vectors needed, respectively.

For example, in order to calculate only half of this vectors, one could do:

&lt;pre&gt;
svd(X, nu = min(nrow(X), ncol(X)) / 2, nv = min(nrow(X), ncol(X))/2)
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Returned object===

&lt;pre&gt;
s = svd(X)
&lt;/pre&gt;
 
Considering:

X = UAV&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;

The returned object is a data structure that contains three fields:

s$d
is the vector that contains the singular values of X, that was got from the diagonal of matrix A.

s$u
is the matrix whose columns contain the left singular vectors of X. Its number
of rows is the same number of rows of X and its number of columns is the number
passed to the parameter nu. Note that if nu is 0, this matrix is not created.

s$v
is the matrix whose columns contain the right singular vectors of X. Its number
of rows is the same number of columns of X and its number of columns is the
number passed to the parameter nv. Note that if nv is 0, this matrix is not
created.
 

===Examples===

Execute the following command sequences in the R terminal or as a R program and see the results:

'''Example 1:'''
&lt;pre&gt;
dat &lt;- seq(1,240,2)

X &lt;- matrix(dat,ncol=12)

s &lt;- svd(X)

A &lt;- diag(s$d)

s$u %*% A %*% t(s$v) #  X = U A V'
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Example 2:'''
&lt;pre&gt;
dat &lt;- seq(1,240,2)

X &lt;- matrix(dat,ncol=12)

s &lt;- svd(X, nu = nrow(X), nv = ncol(X))

A &lt;- diag(s$d)

A &lt;- cbind(A, 0)  # Add two columns with zero, in order to A have the same dimensions of X.

A &lt;- cbind(A, 0)

s$u %*% A %*% t(s$v) #  X = U A V'
&lt;/pre&gt;

=Case Study=

==Scenario==

In order to better visualize the results of SVD, in ths case study we will work
with a matrix that represents an image, so any change on the matrix can be
easily observed.

==Input Data==

To work with an image on R, one should install the package '''rimage''':

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; install.packages(&quot;rimage&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Let's then load the image into R, converting it to a greyscale one. This way,
we will end up with an binary matrix, where 1 means white, and 0 black.

&lt;pre&gt;
library(rimage)
tux &lt;- read.jpeg('tux.jpeg')
tux &lt;- imagematrix(tux,type='grey')
&lt;/pre&gt;

We can see the result of this import:

&lt;pre&gt;
plot(tux)
&lt;/pre&gt;

[[File:Tux_grey.png]]

In order to help us with this dimension reduction, lets make a little help
function, which will receive our '''tux''' and the numbers of dimension we want
and return our new '''tux'''.

&lt;pre&gt;
reduce &lt;- function(A,dim) {
    #Calculates the SVD
    sing &lt;- svd(A)

    #Approximate each result of SVD with the given dimension
    u&lt;-as.matrix(sing$u[, 1:dim])
    v&lt;-as.matrix(sing$v[, 1:dim])
    d&lt;-as.matrix(diag(sing$d)[1:dim, 1:dim])

    #Create the new approximated matrix
    return(imagematrix(u%*%d%*%t(v),type='grey'))
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Execution and output==

Now that we have our matrix, lets se how many singular values it has:

&lt;pre&gt;
tux_d &lt;- svd(tux)
length(tux_d$d)
[1] 335
&lt;/pre&gt;

So we have 335 singular values on this matrix. Lets first try to reduce it to
only one singular value:

&lt;pre&gt;
plot(reduce(tux,1))
&lt;/pre&gt;

[[File:Tux_1.png]]

As we can see, this approximation removes a lot of useful information from our
matrix. If it was a database, we surely would have lost important data.

Lets try with 10% (35) singular values:

&lt;pre&gt;
plot(reduce(tux,35))
&lt;/pre&gt;

[[File:Tux_35.png]]

==Analysis==

With only 10% of the real data we are able to create a very good approximation
of the real data. Moreover, with this method we can remove noises and linear
dependent elements by using only the most important singular values. This is
very useful on data mining, since is hard to identify if a database is
'''clear''' and, if not, which elements are useful or not to our analysis.

*3000 patients diagnosed yearly.
*70-80% related to asbestos exposure
*Not related specifically to smoking; however, smoking + asbestos dramatically increase risk
*M&gt;F
*Peak incidence in 5th to 7th decade.
*96% occurs after 20+ years latency period after asbestos exposure

==Pathology==
*Sarcomatous
*Epithelial (best prognosis of 3 subtypes)
*Mixed

==Prognostic Factors==
'''CALGB Prognostic Index'''  - Based on a trial of 337 patients treated for malignant mesothelioma in 7 phase II CALGB trials.
*Pleural Involvement
*LDH&gt;500 IU/L
*Poor KPS
*Non-epithelial histology
*Age&gt;75

==Resectable disease==
*Surgical resection possible in minority of patients
*Trimodality therapy is treatment of choice for non-metastatic mesothelioma
*Extrapleural pneumonectomy is surgical procedure of choice: Removes ipsilateral lung, parietal pleura, pericardium, diaphragm and mediastinal nodal dissection with reconstruction of the diaphragm.
*Adjuvant radiotherapy includes hemithorax irradiation
*~10% patients fail at biopsy tract, but prophylactic tract RT is probably not beneficial

===Prophylactic RT After Biopsy===
*'''Glasgow, 2007''' (1998-2004) PMID 17588698 -- &quot;A randomised controlled trial of intervention site radiotherapy in malignant pleural mesothelioma.&quot; (O'Rourke N, Radiother Oncol. 2007 Jul;84(1):18-22.)
**Randomized. 61 patients. Chest drain or pleural biospy + RT 21/3 vs. observation
**Tract mets: RT arm 13% vs. supportive care 10% (NS)
**Conclusion: Prophylactic drain site RT does not reduce tumor seeding

*'''Marseille, France, 1995''' PMID 7656629 -- &quot;Prevention of malignant seeding after invasive diagnostic procedures in patients with pleural mesothelioma. A randomized trial of local radiotherapy.&quot; (Boutin C, Chest. 1995 Sep;108(3):754-8.)
**40 pts w/ histologically proven malignant mesothelioma.  Xrt arm received 7 Gy in 3 fractions to the thoracic wall via electrons.  Xrt was 10-15 days after thoroscopy.
**40% in the observation arm developed metastases at the entry tract.  None of the patients in the xrt arm developed entry tract mets.

===Trimodality Therapy===
*'''EORTC 08031, 2011''' (2005-2007) PMID 20525721. Van Schil PE, et al. &quot;Trimodality therapy for malignant pleural mesothelioma: results from an EORTC phase II multicentre trial,&quot; European Respiratory Journal. 2010 Dec;36(6):1362-9.
**57pts tx'd from 2005-2007 with induction cisplatin (75mg/m2) + pemetrexed (500mg/m2) for three cycles followed by  extrapleural pneumonectomy (42pts) followed by hemithorax RT to 54Gy in 30fx (37pts completed RT).
**Local recurrence occured in 16% of patients completing all trimodality therapy. Median OS was 18.4 months.

*'''MSKCC, 2001''' (1995-1998) PMID 11581615.  Rusch, V. et al.  &quot;A phase II trial of surgical resection and adjuvant high-dose hemithoracic radiation for malignant pleural mesothelioma,&quot; Journal of Thoracic Cardiovascular Surgery.  2001 Oct;122(4):788-95
**88 patients tx'd from 1995-1998 with 54 Gy hemithoracic xrt after complete resection.  70% extrapleural pneumonectomies.
**Xrt reduced local recurrence; pts treated w/ extrapleural pneumonectomy w/ adjuvant chemoxrt failed at distant sites.

*'''Harvard, 1999'''  PMID 9869758.  Sugarbaker, D. et al.  &quot;Resection margins, extrapleural nodal status, and cell type determine postoperative long-term survival in trimodality therapy of malignant pleural mesothelioma,&quot;  Journal of Thoracic Cardiovascular Sugery.  1999 Jan;117(1):54-63
**183 patients, resectable mesothelioma with KPS&gt;70.  Patients treated with extrapleural pneumonectomy, adjuvant chemoxrt (30 Gy in 1.5 Gy fx to hemithorax w/ boost to 50.4 Gy, concurrent taxol), adjuvant taxol.
**Peri-operative mortality 3.8%, subgroup w/ extended survival were epithelial type, negative extrapleural nodes, negative margins.  5 yr OS 46% w/ all 3 positive prognostic factors.

*'''MSKCC, 1982''' (1939-1981) PMID 7144218.  McCormack, P. et al.  &quot;Surgical treatment of pleural mesothelioma.&quot;  Journal of Thoracic Cardiovascular Surgery.  1982 Dec;84(6):834-42
**170 pts at MSKCC tx'd from 1939 to 1981 for pleural mesothelioma.  Variation in tx regimens, but after 1972, pts tx'd w/ pleurectomy (w/o lung resection) w/ adjuvant ext beam xrt or brachy.  Median survival for surg + xrt cohort was 21 months w/ better local control than surg alone.
**Conclusion:  multi-modality approach including surgery, xrt and chemo led to better overall survival.

===Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy===
Early studies showed improved local control over historical controls.  
Recent publication from BWH shows a significant mortality from radiation induced pneumonitis when fail to use more stringent dose constraints.

*'''MD Anderson''' (2000-2005)
**'''2007''' PMID 17954086 -- &quot;Outcomes after extrapleural pneumonectomy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy for malignant pleural mesothelioma.&quot; (Rice DC, Ann Thorac Surg. 2007 Nov;84(5):1685-92; discussion 1692-3.)
***Retrospective. 100 patients, who underwent extrapleural pneumonectomy. 63 IMRT (median 45 Gy). Right side 66%, left side 34%. Stage I 6%, Stage II 7%, Stage III 72%, Stage IV 15%; 54% ipsilateral LN+. Perioperative mortality 8%
***Outcome: median OS 10.2 months; if IMRT 14.2 months; if LN- and epithelioid 28 months. Recurrence LR 13%, DM 54%
***Conclusion: IMRT excellent local control, need systemic therapy
**'''2007''' PMID 17467922 -- &quot;Dose-dependent pulmonary toxicity after postoperative intensity-modulated radiotherapy for malignant pleural mesothelioma.&quot; (Rice DC, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Oct 1;69(2):350-7. Epub 2007 Apr 30.)
***Retrospective. 63 patients treated with IMRT after extrapleural pneumonectomy. Dose 45-50 Gy
***Outcome: 37% died within 6 months (43% recurrence, 17% pneumonia, 9% pneumonitis, 31% non-cancer and non-pulmonary causes)
***Predictors of pulmonary-related death: only contralateral V20. If &gt;7%, 42X risk of death. Also, if absolute lung volume receiving 10 Gy &gt;1200 cm3 and 5 Gy &gt;300 cm3 had better outcome
***Conclusion: Fatal pulmonary toxicity (9%) associated with V20

*'''Harvard, 2006''' PMID 16751058.  Allen, AM. et al.  &quot;Fatal pneumonitis associated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy for mesothelioma,&quot;  Int J Radiat Oncol, Biol, Phys.  2006 Jul 1;65(3):640-5.
**Pts treated to 54 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions.  Contralateral lung limited to V20 of 20%.  6 of 13 patients developed fatal radiation pneumonitis.  
**Conclusion:  metrics such as V5 and MLD should be used in addition to V20 to determine patient tolerance to xrt.

==Unresectable disease==
*One randomized trial suggests that chemotherapy (MVP) may not be superior to active symptomatic control alone; there may be benefit to vinorelbine alone
*Two randomized trials suggest that cisplatin + antifolate (pemetrexed or raltitrexed) should be used over cisplatin alone
*The role of cisplatin itself is not clear, but it has been used historically


*'''British MS01''' (2001 - 2006) - Active Symptom Control vs. ACS + MVP vs. ACS + vinorelbine
**Randomized, 3 arms. 409 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. Arm 1) Active symptom control (steroids, analgesics, bronchodilators, palliative RT) vs. Arm 2) ASC + MVP (mitomycin 6 mg/m2, vinblastine 6mg/m2, cisplatin 50mg/m2) vs. Arm 3) ASC + vinorelbine 20 mg/m2
**'''2008''' PMID 18486741 -- &quot;Active symptom control with or without chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MS01): a multicentre randomised trial.&quot; (Muers MF, Lancet. 2008 May 17;371(9625):1685-94.)
***Outcome: median OS ASC 7.6 months vs. ASC + chemo 8.5 months (NS); subset trend benefit for vinorelbine 9.5 months (p=0.08)
***Toxicity: No difference
***Conclusion: Addition of MVP or vinorelbine to active symptom control offered no significant benefit

*'''EORTC-NCIC 08983''' (2000-2003) - Cisplatin vs. Cisplatin + Raltitrexed
**Randomized. 250 patients with advanced malginant pleural mesothelioma. Arm 1) cisplatin 80 mg/m2 vs. Arm 2) cisplatin 80 mg/m2 + raltitrexed 3 mg/m2
**'''2005''' PMID 16192580 -- &quot;Randomized phase III study of cisplatin with or without raltitrexed in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma: an intergroup study of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Lung Cancer Group and the National Cancer Institute of Canada.&quot; (van Meerbeeck JP, J Clin Oncol. 2005 Oct 1;23(28):6881-9.)
***Outcome: median OS cisplatin 9 months vs. cisplatin + raltitrexed 11 months (SS); 1-year OS 40% vs. 46% (SS)
***Conclusion: Raltitrexed and cisplatin improves survival compared with cisplatin alone

*'''Pemetrexed Trial''' (1999-2001) - Cisplatin vs. Cisplatin + Pemetrexed
**Randomized. 456 patients with chemo-naive and inoperable mesothelioma. Arm 1) cisplatin 75 mg/m2 vs. Arm 2 cisplatin 75 mg/m2 + pemetrexed 500 mg/m2
***'''2003''' PMID 12860938 -- &quot;Phase III study of pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin versus cisplatin alone in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.&quot;  (Vogelzang NJ, J Clin Oncol. 2003 Jul 15;21(14):2636-44.)
***Outcome: median OS cisplatin 9 months vs cisplatin/pemetrexed 12 months (SS); time-to-progression 3.9 months vs. 5.7 months (SS)
***Conclusion: Pemetrexed + cisplatin + vitamin supplements resulted in superior outcome compared with cisplatin alone</text>

The features of the lua programming language include:

* Lua is an extension programming language
* Suitable for use as an embedded language within a host application
* Cross Platform Support
* Implemented in ANSI C
* Lightweight core occupies just 60k and executable footprint of just 140k
* Easy to use conventional scripting language
* Dynamic datatypes
* Powerful builtin support for text processing
* Interpreted bytecode compilation for fast and efficient execution
* Stack based virtual machine model
* Support for procedural, object oriented, functional and datadriven programming
* Supports coercion
* freeform syntax
* casesensitivity
* keywords

== History of Lua ==

Lua was first developed in an academic laboratory as a tool for inhouse software development but it was later adopted by several industrial projects around the world and is now widely used in the game industry.

== When to use Lua ==

== Where is Lua on the hammer scale? ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">There is an infinite number of ways to introduce your dissertation research project. There does not seem to be a common way, however, may elements overlap. Think if it as a set of logical steps explaining what you are planning to do:
*What do you want to study?
*Why do you want to study it? Why is it important?
*How are you going to study it?	
These questions can be answered through a series of logical steps, but not all of these steps have to be present in all dissertations
#Introduction/background. How did this study come about? What motivated you to do it? It is fine to list both personal reasons for doing a study and to show the extent of a problem that motivated you to do it. Make it engaging, and captivating, but don’t dwell on your life story; this is not a memoir. 
#Problem Statement. It is a statement about what we don’t know, but need to know. There can be two subsets: a practical problem, and a theoretical one. For example, a problem can be that there is no effective strategy for preventing drop-outs among Hispanic boys. A theoretical problem can be that research does not show a comprehensive, multi-factored analysis of the causes of high school drop-out. 
#Definition of Terms. Just define your main concepts – these can be either definition drawn from the literature, or your own. 
#Purpose. Begin with “The purpose of this study is to…” change, interpret, understand, evaluate, or analyze the problem. Do I need to mention it needs to be directly aligned with the problem? 
#Research question. Look at your purpose, and break it down into a set of questions that help achieve it. Do not go beyond 3-4 questions.
#Hypothesis. What are you expecting to find? What assumption are you testing? It is a lot more specific and formal in a quantitative study, and less specific in a qualitative one. Some qualitative researchers, usually of the anthropological bent, avoid the term “hypothesis,” since it refers to a positivist framework. They prefer terms like “hunch” or “conjecture.” However, you need a working theory of what’s going on, which can be proven or disproven. Laying out one or more rival hypotheses is always a great idea. For example, you think that family disengagement is an important factor determining the timing of high school drop-out. And you can find it through in-depth interviews and observations. But it may also be the case that the subjects 
#Significance. If you answer the question, what contribution is your study going to make to the field and what sort of practical implications it may have? What is new about your study? 
#Conceptual framework. The way you chose to think about the problem – which concepts did you decide to use and why? You can think about the same problem through different theoretical lenses. For example, high school drop-outs can be viewed as an economic problem (then you would use such concepts as human capital, return on investment, etc.), or as a psychological problem (personality traits, social inclusion, etc.). The same problem can be viewed as a pedagogical one, which will lead you think about engagement, curriculum, learning motivation, teaching strategies.
#Design. Give a brief overview of what exactly you are planning to do: sequence of measurements, ways of analysis, etc. A timeline would be great to include  - proposed in a proposal, factual in a dissertation.  
#Methodology rationale. How can a study like this be possible? Why a study like yours may actually work? Explain in very brief way why you chose the methodology. You will say more about this in a subsequent methods chapter. 
#Assumptions/researcher’s stand. Make explicit things that you are not going to test, but which inform your views anyway. This is a more general theory of how things work, as well as your values as a researcher. A more detailed explanation and rationale will be given in Chapter 3. 
#Scope and Limitations. There are methodological and conceptual limitations. Methodological ones include limitations of sampling, the method used, various data pollution scenarios, etc. The conceptual limitations are what you are ignoring because of the conceptual framework you use. Make sure to state the degree of generalizability of your future findings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Feature Selection in R with the FSelector Package==
===Introduction===

In Data Mining, Feature Selection is the task where we intend to reduce the dataset dimension by analyzing and understanding the impact of its features on a model. Consider for example a predictive model &lt;i&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = S&lt;/i&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; are constants, &lt;i&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; are features and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; is the predictor output. It is interesting to understand how important are the used features (&lt;i&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) and what are their relevance to the model and their correlation with &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. Such analysis allow us to select a subset of the original features, reducing the dimension and complexity of future steps on the Data Mining process. During a subset selection, we try to identify and remove as much of the irrelevant and redundant information as possible.

Techniques for Feature Selection can be divided in two approaches: '''feature ranking''' and '''subset selection'''. In the first approach, features are ranked by some criteria and then features above a defined threshold are selected. In the second approach, one searches a space of feature subsets for the optimal subset. Moreover, the second apprach can be split in three parts:

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;'''Filter approaches:''' you select the features first, then you use this subset to execute a classification algorithm;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;'''Embedded approaches''' the feature selection occurs as part a classification algorithm;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;'''Wrapper approaches''' an algorithm for classification is applied over the dataset in order to identify the best features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


The FSelector Package for R offers algorithms for filtering attributes (e.g. cfs, chi-squared, information gain, linear correlation) and algorithms for wrapping classifiers and search attribute subset space (e.g. best-first search, back-ward search, forward search, hill climbing search). The package also makes it possible to choose subsets of features based on attributes' weights by performing different ways of cutoff.

The FSelector Package was created by Piotr Romanski and this article is based on the version 0.16, released in April 11, 2009.

===The Feature Ranking Approach===
As we explained, in the ranking approach, features are ranked by some criteria and those which are above a defined threshold are selected. A general algorithm can be considered for such approach where you just need to decide which one if the best ranking criteria to be used. In the F-Selector Package, such criteria is represented by a set of functions that calculate weights to your features according to a model. All of this elements will be explained in this text.

====Feature Ranking Algorithm====

The general algorithm for the Feature Ranking Approach is:

 for each feature F_i&lt;br&gt;
    wf_i = getFeatureWeight(F_i)&lt;br&gt;
    add wf_i to weight_list&lt;br&gt;
 sort weight_list&lt;br&gt;
 choose top-k features&lt;br&gt;

We can translate such algorithm idea to R language by these commands:
 
&lt;code&gt;
 #load a dataset and use it as the main source of data&lt;br&gt;
 library(mlbench)&lt;br&gt;
 data(HouseVotes84)&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 #calculate weights for each atribute using some function&lt;br&gt;
 weights &lt;- '''SOME_FUNCTION'''(Class~., HouseVotes84)&lt;br&gt;
 print(weights)&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 #select a subset of 5 features with the lowest weight&lt;br&gt;
 subset &lt;- cutoff.k(weights, 5)&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 #print the results&lt;br&gt;
 f &lt;- as.simple.formula(subset, &quot;Class&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
 print(f)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

On the first part of the code above, we use the function ''library'' to load the package ''mlbench'' which contains a collection of artificial and real-world machine learning benchmark problems, including, e.g., several data sets from the UCI repository.(http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mlbench/index.html). After that, we use the ''mlbench'' dataset ''HouseVotes84'' (United States Congressional Voting Records 1984) as the working data source for the later steps. Instead of using the ''HouseVotes84'', you can also define your own dataset and provide it as the input for the algorithm.&lt;br&gt;

The ''HouseVotes84'' data set includes votes for each of the U.S. House of Representatives Congressmen on the 16
key votes identified by the CQA. The CQA contains 16 variables, and consider ninve different types of votes represented by three classes: yea (voted for, paired for, announced for), nay (voted against, paired against, announced against) and  unknown (voted present, voted present to avoid conflict of interest, did not vote or otherwise make a position known). 

On the second part of the code above, we calculate weights for each attribute using some function. This function must be selected by the user and they are listed later on this text. The output of those functions will be a list of features and its weights according to the chosen technique, and that will be available in the ''weights'' array. You can print the weights like we do using the command ''print''. 

On the third part of the code, we define a cut-off of the top-5 features of the ''weights'' array. By using the function ''cutoff.k'', we inform the array name and the ''k'' value, that is 5 in our case. The result will be stored in another array, called ''subset'', cointaining the 5 features with the highest rank weight.

On the fourth part of the code, you can print the final model as a simple formula, composed by the features subset present in the ''subset'' array, and the predictable feature names ''Class''.

====Available Feature Ranking Techniques in FSelector Package====
All the listed techniques below can be used to generate rank weights for features. The first parameter, ''formula'', is a symbolic description of a model (e.g. Class~. for a model where all the features are used do predict the feature ''Class''). The second parameter, ''data'',  is the target data to be considered in the model.

=====Chi-squared Filter=====
Usage:

 chi.squared(formula, data)

=====Correlation Filter=====
Usage for Pearson’s correlation:

 linear.correlation(formula, data)

Usage for Spearman’s correlation:

 rank.correlation(formula, data)

=====Entropy-Based Filter=====
Usage for Information Gain:

 information.gain(formula, data)

Usage for Gain Ratio:

 gain.ratio(formula, data)

Usage for Symmetrical Uncertainty:

 symmetrical.uncertainty(formula, data)

=====OneR Algorithm=====
Usage:
 
 oneR(formula, data)

=====Random Forest Filter=====
Usage:
 random.forest.importance(formula, data, importance.type = 1)

Where the ''importance.type'' parameter specify the type of importance measure (1=mean decrease in
accuracy, 2=mean decrease in node impurity).

===The Feature Subset Selection Approach===

In the feature subset selection approach, one searches a space of feature subsets for the optimal subset. Such approach is present on the FSelector package by wrappers techniques (e.g. best-first search, back-ward search, forward search, hill climbing search). Those techniques works by informing a function that takes a subset and generate an evaluation value for that subset. A search is performed in the subsets space until the best solution can be found.

==== Feature Subset Selection Algorithm====
The general algorithm for the Feature Subset Selection approach is:

 S = all subsets&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 for each subset s in S&lt;br&gt;
    evaluate(s)&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
 return (the best subset)&lt;br&gt;  

We can translate the algorithm idea in R by using these commands:

 #load a dataset and use it as the main source of data&lt;br&gt;
 library(mlbench)&lt;br&gt;
 data(HouseVotes84)&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 #define the evaluation function
 evaluator &lt;- function(subset) {&lt;br&gt;
   #here you must define a function that returns a double value to evaluate the given subset&lt;br&gt;
   #consider high values for good evaluation and low values for bad evaluation.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
   return(something)&lt;br&gt;
 }&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 #perform the best subset search&lt;br&gt;
 subset &lt;- MY_FUNCTION(data, evaluator)&lt;br&gt;

 #prints the result&lt;br&gt;
 f &lt;- as.simple.formula(subset, &quot;Class&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
 print(f)

As in the first example on this text, we use again the HouseVotes84 dataset from the mlbench library. We must define a evaluation function that wil do some calculus over a given subset and return a high value for a good subset. Later, all you have to do is choose a search strategy and you can also print the selection.

====Feature Subset Search Techniques Available in FSelector Package====
The FSelector Package offers some functions to search for the best subset selection. In most of them, the ''attributes'' parameters is a character vector of all attributes to search (the set of features that will be parted in subsets during the search), and the ''eval.fun'' parameter is a function taking as first parameter a character vector of all attributes and returning
a numeric indicating how important a given subset is. The CFS and the Consistency techniques encapsulate such process by using the best first approach, so, you just have to inform the symbolic model and the data, like in the ranking approach.

=====Best First Search=====
Usage:
 best.first.search(attributes, eval.fun)

=====Exhaustive Search=====
Usage:
 exhaustive.search(attributes, eval.fun)

=====Greedy Search=====
Usage for forward greedy search:
 forward.search(attributes, eval.fun)

Usage for backward greedy  search:
 backward.search(attributes, eval.fun)

=====Hill Climbing Search=====
Usage:
 hill.climbing.search(attributes, eval.fun)

=====CFS Filter=====
Usage:
 cfs(formula, data)

=====Consistency Based Filter=====
Usage:
 consistency(formula, data)

=== Syntax ===
There are two standard [[chess]] diagram templates:

* [[Template:Chess diagram]] (square size 26x26 px)
* [[Template:Chess diagram small]] (square size 22x22 px)

The syntax is basically the same for both of them.

&lt;pre&gt;
{{chess diagram
| &lt;alignment&gt; (param #1)
| &lt;header&gt;    (#2) 
| size =
| numbers =
| letters =
| &lt;a8&gt; | &lt;b8&gt; | ... | &lt;h8&gt;  (#3 to ...
| &lt;a7&gt; | &lt;b7&gt; | ... | &lt;h7&gt;
...
| &lt;a1&gt; | &lt;b1&gt; | ... | &lt;h1&gt;  ( ... #66)
| &lt;footer&gt; (#67)
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Parameters:

* &lt;code&gt;&lt;alignment&gt;&lt;/code&gt; – defines horizontal alignment (floating) of the whole table, must be &lt;code&gt;tright&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;tleft&lt;/code&gt; (or nothing)
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;header&gt;&lt;/code&gt; – the text which appears above the diagram, may be empty;
* &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt; - specifies the size of each square in pixels, the default is 26.
* &lt;code&gt;numbers&lt;/code&gt; - specifies whether the rows are numbered. Options are: ''left'', ''right'', ''both'' (default) or ''neither''.
* &lt;code&gt;letters&lt;/code&gt; - specifies whether the columns are lettered. Options are: ''top'', ''bottom'', ''both'' (default) or ''neither''.
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;a8&gt;, &lt;b8&gt;, ... &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; – define corresponding squares of the chessboard, see below;
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;/code&gt; – the text which appears beneath the diagram, may be empty; optional – can be left out (currently not in the other templates)

A square is defined by the name of piece or empty parameter. The names of the pieces are those given in algebraic notation:

* [[File:Chess kll45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess kld45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess kdl45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess kdd45.svg|26px]] k = king 
* [[File:Chess qld45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess qll45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess qdd45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess qdl45.svg|26px]] q = queen 
* [[File:Chess rll45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess rld45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess rdl45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess rdd45.svg|26px]] r = rook 
* [[File:Chess bld45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess bll45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess bdd45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess bdl45.svg|26px]] b = bishop 
* [[File:Chess nll45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess nld45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess ndl45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess ndd45.svg|26px]] n = knight 
* [[File:Chess pld45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess pll45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess pdd45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess pdl45.svg|26px]] p = pawn

There are also some [[w:fairy chess piece|fairy chess piece]]s available:

* [[File:Chess all44.png|26px]] [[File:Chess ald44.png|26px]] [[File:Chess adl44.png|26px]] [[File:Chess add44.png|26px]] a = archbishop (knight + bishop compound)
* [[File:Chess cld44.png|26px]] [[File:Chess cll44.png|26px]] [[File:Chess cdd44.png|26px]] [[File:Chess cdl44.png|26px]] c = chancelor (knight + rook compound)
* [[File:Chess fll45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess fld45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess fdl45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess fdd45.svg|26px]] f = upside-down king 
* [[File:Chess gld45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess gll45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess gdd45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess gdl45.svg|26px]] g = upside-down queen 
* [[File:Chess mll45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess mld45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess mdl45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess mdd45.svg|26px]] m = upside-down rook 
* [[File:Chess eld45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess ell45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess edd45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess edl45.svg|26px]] e = upside-down bishop
* [[File:Chess sll45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess sld45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess sdl45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess sdd45.svg|26px]] s = upside-down knight 
* [[File:Chess hld45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess hll45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess hdd45.svg|26px]] [[File:Chess hdl45.svg|26px]] h = upside-down pawn 
* [[File:Chess zll44.png|26px]] [[File:Chess zld44.png|26px]] [[File:Chess zdl44.png|26px]] [[File:Chess zdd44.png|26px]] z = champion (for Omega Chess) 
* [[File:Chess wld44.png|26px]] [[File:Chess wll44.png|26px]] [[File:Chess wdd44.png|26px]] [[File:Chess wdl44.png|26px]] w = wizard (for Omega Chess) 

These letters are combined with either &quot;l&quot; for Light=White, or &quot;d&quot; for Dark=Black. So &quot;kl&quot; is White's king, and &quot;nd&quot; is Black's knight. 

An empty square is written either using underscores, spaces, or nothing at all. Two spaces are recommended.

* [[File:Chess d45.svg|26px]][[File:Chess l45.svg|26px]] &lt;space&gt; = empty square

You can also use &quot;xx&quot; for a cross, &quot;xo&quot; for a black circle on an empty square or &quot;oo&quot; for a white one.

* [[File:Chess xxd45.svg|26px]][[File:Chess xxl45.svg|26px]] xx = cross/x
* [[File:Chess xod45.svg|26px]][[File:Chess xol45.svg|26px]] xo = black circle
* [[File:Chess ood45.svg|26px]][[File:Chess ool45.svg|26px]] oo = white circle

Numbers can also be added to squares by using &quot;x0&quot; for 0, &quot;x1&quot; for 1, &quot;x2&quot; for 2, ..., &quot;x9&quot; for 9. 

* [[File:Chess x0d45.svg|26px]][[File:Chess x0l45.svg|26px]] x0
* [[File:Chess x1d45.svg|26px]][[File:Chess x1l45.svg|26px]] x1
* [[File:Chess x2d45.svg|26px]][[File:Chess x2l45.svg|26px]] x2
* [[File:Chess x3d45.svg|26px]][[File:Chess x3l45.svg|26px]] x3
* [[File:Chess x4d45.svg|26px]][[File:Chess x4l45.svg|26px]] x4
* [[File:Chess x5d45.svg|26px]][[File:Chess x5l45.svg|26px]] x5
* [[File:Chess x6d45.svg|26px]][[File:Chess x6l45.svg|26px]] x6
* [[File:Chess x7d45.svg|26px]][[File:Chess x7l45.svg|26px]] x7
* [[File:Chess x8d45.svg|26px]][[File:Chess x8l45.svg|26px]] x8
* [[File:Chess x9d45.svg|26px]][[File:Chess x9l45.svg|26px]] x9

=== Examples ===
In the following examples the rows and columns are numbered. Because any text between &quot;|=&quot; and the next &quot;|&quot; is ignored, numbers and letters can be added without affecting output. 

==== Standard diagram ====
This diagram is recommended for common use as a main diagram in books on chess openings, endings, games, positions etc. See the corresponding code below.

== PDF and Print Version ==

I would recommend creating a print version and a PDF version soon, before this project gets too big. It will take a very long time to make both, so I would recommend making them and maintaining them twice a month. If this is done, it will ease the work load for any future contributors. I would do both, but I don't have the means to do so.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Ligand Binding=

== General Information ==
One of the functions of [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]] is to bind different molecules together.  A [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein function/Ligand|ligand]] is a molecule that is recognized by a protein and is able to bind to the target protein.  The site at which the ligand binds to the protein is called the ligand-binding site.  The ligand-binding site on the protein is quite flexible, making it easier for the ligand to bind to it.  Ligand-binding sites are complementary to the protein to which it binds to.  As expected, shape plays a significant role in fitting the ligand to the protein.  In addition to that, the charge of the ligand and protein also plays a role.

Similar to the ligand-binding site, an active site is a cavity in the protein surface to which enzymes bind to.  The active site is surrounded by amino acids that have the highest affinity to the enzyme that will carry out the reaction.  Once again, the shape, charge and polarity of the amino acids affect the binding effects of the enzymes.

There are three models for how an [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzymes]] fits into the active site: the lock-and-key model, the induced fit model, and the transition state model.  The lock-and key model assumes that the active site is a perfect fit for the enzyme.  This model is a more rigid model that does not allow any modification of the active site or the enzyme.  The induced fit model is a derivation of the lock-and-key model which still assumes that an active site is designed specifically for the recognition of one enzyme but both the active site and enzyme are flexible and can slightly modify to create the perfect fit. In the transition state model, the active sites binds to the enzyme in its transition state. This effectively lowers the activation energy needed for the reaction to be carried out. 

[[Image:PDB 1a40 EBI.jpg|300px]]

''Note: Above is a phosphate-binding protein''

In summary, the properties of proteins that affects the ability of enzymes to bind to it are its flexibility, complementarity, surfaces and non-covalent forces.  The flexibility allows an easier fit between binding sites and enzymes.  The complementarity and surfaces are important factors that contribute to the specificity of an enzyme to the binding site.  It may be assumed that covalent forces are used due to their ability to better bind to the enzyme to its active site.  However, the strong binding forces of covalent bonds makes it too difficult for active site to release the enzyme.  It must be kept in mind that the enzymes do not bind forever in the active site and as a result non-covalent forces are the best for easy recognition of the substrate and releasing it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nature of Binding Sites&lt;br /&gt;
1. Generally have a higher than average amount of exposed hydrophobic surface&lt;br /&gt;
2. Weak interaction can lead to an easy exchange of partners&lt;br /&gt;
3. Displacement of water also drives binding events&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Viadiu, Hector. &quot;Nature of Binding Sites.&quot; UCSD Lecture. November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ligand Binding by Repeat Proteins ==
The unique structures of repeat proteins grant them their functions. Their surface area to volume ratio is much higher than typical globular proteins. This characteristic makes them very well suited in mediating protein–protein interactions and organizing multiple proteins into functional complexes.

A property about repeat proteins is that individual repeats and the positions relative between those proteins are the same despite in which protein they occur. As repeat proteins bind to ligands, there is little to no conformational change. Scientists have compared different repeat protein structures with and without ligands bound using RMSD, or root mean square deviation. Studying β-catenin which contains 12 armadillo repeats, scientists have also found a Robo complex. This complex helps to develop bilateral symmetry in insects and vertebrates.

Repeat proteins also bind extended ligands. These proteins use multiple repeats to create an extended surface area for interaction with those extended ligands. This efficiently creates tight binding. Usually, a repeat protein interacts with a peptide that is extended or with a secondary structure element from the target protein.

The fact that repeat proteins are extended helps different regions of these proteins interacts with different ligands which bring the two into a functional complex. This multi-protein structure happens many ways. For an Hsp organizing protein or HOP, two discrete sets of TPR or tetratrico peptide repeat modules (one binding to Hsp70 and the other Hsp90) carry chaperones together to form a functional complex. [[File:PDB 2nym EBI.jpg|thumb|HEAT Repeat Protein]] HEAT repeats are used to make multi-protein complexes in proteins that function differently from average proteins in their nucleocytoplasmatic transport. HEAT repeats in karyopherin form a superhelix and the external convex surface aids in nucleoporin binding while the inner concave face allows for binding with a regulatory protein Ran-GTP. Protein Phosphatase 2A or PP2A is a heterotrimeric protein that has a scaffold subunit to bind to regulatory and catalytic subunits of different HEAT repeat sets. Different versions of the complex exist so different sets of repeats binding within the HEAT domain are independent. An interesting fact is that SV40 small T antigen interferes PP2A’s function by competing with the regulatory subunit which binds to HEAT.

&lt;br /&gt;
Usually, when there are multiple repeats, a repeat contributes to a binding interface that has the same structural element. There are exceptions to this, though. A helical bundle is formed from the N-terminal capping armadillo repeat when H2 and H3 is packed in the helical BCL9 (β-catenin).Also, a protein like TPR, Fis1, forms complexes with Mdv1 or Caf4 proteins. The N-terminal α-helix of Fis1 takes up the usual hydrophobic groove found on the concave surface on its TPR domain. An α-helix from the target protein comes into a second hydrophobic groove on the concave face. What is atypical, however, is the interaction with Caf4 and a second α-helix from the target protein binding to the convex part of the TPR domain. Finally, a composite surface used for binding the third protein may interact with a repeat protein. Looking at the CSL-Notch-Mastermind complex, we see that Mastermind interacts with Notch1 and CSL simultaneously but neither of these undergo a big conformational change when the complex forms. This means that Mastermind distinguishes the composite surface from both rather than binding to either through allosteric induction.

Repeat proteins do more than just protein-protein interactions. More and more repeat proteins are found to bind to ligands. Instead of specialized folds, the same repeat and fold are binding to many different types of ligands. A well-known example is the toll-like receptor or TLR from mammalian immune systems that bind proteins, lipoproteins/peptides, and nucleic acids. HEAT repeats can also bind in many ways. They are usually found intervening protein-protein interactions but can be found binding nucleic acids.

Protein designers are working on making new repeat proteins because simple and short repeat proteins can be used to bind many ligands using scaffolds. Many sequence alignments and structural characterizations allow for a clear description of structural and functional residues that are important. Two complementary strategies are being used: 1- introducing novel binding specificities onto existing repeat scaffolds and 2 – creating new scaffolds onto which known binding sites are grafted.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18602006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Organization of Multi-protein Complexes====

The extended, modular nature of repeat proteins allows for different sections of the protein to be used to bind many different ligands and then bring them together to form functional complexes. An example of this function of repeat proteins is the Hsp organizing protein(HOP), in which two defined sets of TPR modules each bind to Hsp 70 and Hsp 90 to bring them together into a complex.

Typically, when binding involves multiple repeats, each repeat contributes to the binding interface with the same structural element. In a given repeat protein, its binding interface could be formed by only H1 helices,or antiparallel beta strands,etc.

====Research====
Repeat proteins have become key targets for protein design. Two strategies have been employed in synthesizing new repeat proteins: 1) addition of new binding specificities onto existing repeat scaffolds, and 2) synthesize new scaffolds onto which known binding sites are inserted. For example, Ank repeats have been used extensively in the first strategy presented.In another example, a TPR module has been designed by grafting Hsp90-binding residues onto a synthesized consensus TPR scaffold. What this has done is create a new protein that has greater affinity and specificity for Hsp90 than natural Hsp90 co-chaperones. This has had significant impact in fighting breast cancer. Synthesizing stronger versions of existing repeat proteins is one way in which the second strategy is used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the most common functions of enzyme is the ability to catalyze reactions.  During a reaction, the reactants must overcome activation energy in order for it to produce the products.  The amount of activation energy needed determines how long the reaction takes to proceed.  The lower the activation energy makes the faster rate of the reaction.  The role of enzymes in catalyzing reactions is to stabilize the intermediate species, which is at the highest point of the activation energy, and thus dropping the activation energy.  The enzyme is complementary not to the substrate but its intermediate state.  If the enzyme binds to the substrate, it actually increases the activation energy. The equilibrium achieved is the same with or without the catalytic enzyme.  However, what is affected is the time and rate in which it is achieved.  

[[File:CatalysisScheme.png|400px]]

Generally, the higher the concentration of the substrate, the easier it is for the enzyme to bind to it.  By plotting the amount of product produced as a function of time, the slope is how fast the reaction happens before the amount of substrate is saturated.  This value is called the V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  Increasing the substrate concentration will increase the V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  However, there is a certain point in which the substrate concentration is too high and the reaction will not proceed any faster.  This point is called the maximum velocity, V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;.  Every enzyme has their unique V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; value.  Another important identity of an enzyme is the K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; value, defined as the substrate concentration at half of V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;.  K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is also unique to each enzyme.  The turnover rate, the rate at which products are produced is called the K&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;.  Dividing K&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt; by K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; gives the efficiency constant of the enzyme, which tells how fast the reaction is carried out and how likely the enzyme is to find the substrate. For more information, refer to Catalysis.

=== Phosphoryl-Transfer Reaction: Mechanisms and Catalysis ===

A key feature of phosphoryl-transfer reactions is that they often have extremely slow nonenzymatic rates and thus require large reaction rate accelerations using catalysts. The reactions that occur at the phosphorous atom of the phosphate ester also form the chemical basis for many of the most important and fundamental processes in living systems because they allow for the inheritance of genetic information through nucleic acids and are also responsible for using energy coupling to drive thermodynamically unfavorable reactions crucial to maintaining cell health and vitality. Phosphoryl transfer reactions also play an important role in metabolic pathways and signal transduction as well. 

One possible mechanism for catalysis in these phosphoryl tranfer reactions is the hydrolysis of phosphate monoesters. The hydrolysis rate often increases significantly as the pH decreases; this change indicates that the protonated form of the phosphate monoesters react much more quickly than the phosphate monoester dianions. The fact that these reactions are often carried out rapidly, with the help of enzymes, can be attributed to several factors. For example, the activation of the nucleophile can be accomplished in one of three ways; the way that the nucleophile is positioned can affect the nucleophile by increasing or even decreasing it. Another way is to reduce the electrostatic repulsion. One of the most important features of enzymes is their ability to use the binding interactions and positioned groups to carry out catalysis. The ability of enzymes to be able to accomplish this directly combines enzyme specificity with catalysis.

In phosphoryl transfer reactions, it’s also important that the nucleophile is aligned with the phosphorous atom as well as the leaving group for attack at phosphorous. Another factor that can contribute to the catalysis of monoester reactions is the stabilization of the negative charge on the potential leaving group. It has also been found that the transition states for phosphoryl transfer reactions can often be loose, tight, or synchronous depending on whether the compounds are phosphate monoesters, diesters, or triesters. Phosphate monoester usually proceeds through loose transition states, diesters through synchronous transition states, and triesters through tight transition states.

The presence of positively charged functional groups in the enzymes used in phosphoryl transfer reactions can also affect the reaction’s interactions with the oxygen atoms of the transferred phosphoryl group.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==

MicroRNAs(miRNAs) are short, single-stranded RNAs that are about 21 nucleotides in length. Their function is to regulate gene expression. Like other types of RNA, miRNAs are transcribed from DNA; However, they do not participate in protein translation. miRNAs are non-coding RNAs that bind to complementary mRNA and inhibit their translation. miRNAs and siRNAs both function to interfere with gene expression.  However, miRNAs are single-stranded, whereas siRNAs are double-stranded. 

miRNAs have been determined to play a crucial role in regulation of DNA damage response. Scientists believe that the transmission of generic information in eukaryotic cells requires accuracy in DNA replication and chromosome as well as the ability to sense and repair spontaneous and induce DNA damage. In order to maintain genomic integrity, cells undergo a DNA damage response, a complex network of signaling pathways. This network is composed of coordinates sensors, tranducers and effectors in cell cycle arrest, appotosis and DNA repair.&lt;ref&gt;    Wan, Guohui, Rohit Mathur, Xiaoxiao Hu, Xinna Zhang, and Xiongbin Lu. &quot;ScienceDirect.com - Trends in Biochemical Sciences - miRNA response to DNA damage.&quot; ScienceDirect.com | Search through over 11 million science, health, medical journal full text articles and books.. N.p., n.d. Web. 7 Dec. 2012. &lt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000411000855&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

miRNAs have recently been linked to various diseases. Recent researches have shown that there is connection between dysregulation of miRNAs with certain diseases, which leads to the need of further researching in robust regulation of miRNA activity.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, T.C. and Mendell, J.T. (2007) microRNAs in vertebrate physiology and human disease. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 8, 215–239&lt;/ref&gt; 

miRNAs once were considered to be very stable molecules because miRNAs expression is known to be strictly controlled by the mechanisms acting at the level of transcription and also the processing of miRNA precursors. However, recently, scientists have figured out another mechanism that is important for miRNA homeostasis which is the active degradation of mature miRNAs. Degradation of miRNA takes role in dynamic miRNA expression patterns. Researches showed that miRNAs degradation can have affect on specific sets of miRNAs even though how this specificity comes about still remains unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Großhans, Rüegger . &quot;MicroRNA turnover: when, how, and why. [Trends Biochem Sci. 2012] - PubMed - NCBI.&quot; National Center for Biotechnology Information. N.p., n.d. Web. 6 Dec. 2012. &lt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22921610&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation &amp; Function ==

The main function of miRNAs is to regulate the translation of mRNA. In the nucleus, the miRNAs are first transcribed as primary miRNAs(pri-miRNAs) with caps and a poly-A tail. The pri-miRNAs are then processed into precursor miRNAs(pre-miRNAs) by an enzyme called Drosha. The structure of pre-miRNA is a 70 nucleotide-long stem-loop structure. The pre-miRNAs are then exported into the cytoplasm and split into mature miRNAs by an enzyme called Dicer. These mature miRNAs will integrate into the RNA-induced silencing complex(RISC) and activate the RISC. The activated RISC can then allow miRNAs to bind with the targeted mRNA and silence the gene expression. In animal cells, miRNAs are more commonly base paired with the mRNA and inhibit protein translation. The binding of miRNAs to complementary mRNA can degrade the mRNA and therefore terminate protein translation. Or miRNA can inhibit the reading of the 5'-cap and prevent translation. In plant cells, the miRNAs are more likely to perfectly bind with the target mRNA and promote cleavage. MicroRNA's are formed from the hairpins of long single-srranded RNA's that fold in on themselves. The double-stranded hairpins get cut by enzymes called dicer and results in a single-stranded microRNA. MircroRNA then forms a microRNA-protein complex and can then degrade a targeted mRNA and also block translation of targeted mRNA. In few instances, miRNA have shown signs of promoting translation, especially under starvation conditions. The reason for such activity are not known. 

== Canonical miRNA Function ==

Developing studies have demonstrated that miRNAs carry on a critical role in interacting with the canonical DNA damage response. The DNA damage response is an active system that includes commencement of transcriptional programs, enhancement of DNA restoration, and apoptosis if damage is severe. Breakages in DNA double-strands are mended by homologous re-fusion and non-homologous end-connecting repair pathways. Other forms of DNA damage are repaired by base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), and DNA mismatch repair (MMR).

miRNA play a significant part in gene regulation and other cellular functions. Many important genes in the DNA damage response are managed by their corresponding miRNAs. For one, miRNAs monitor DNA damage response by way of target genes. In the process of DNA repair, chromatin remodeling takes place to permit DNA repair proteins access to DNA that are damaged. With more miRNA targets such as ATM, H2AX, and RAD52, DNA responsive genes are under inhibition by miRNAs. It has been revealed that higher expression of a certain miRNA -such as miR-421- will reduce  ATM delivery, and downregulate H2AX in particular cellular situations. 

DNA damaging agents in various treatments have proven to initiate miRNAs. Occurrences of DNA damage have depicted a correlation with the activation of miRNAs, underlying the significance that miRNAs regulate DNA damage response based on the magnitude of the DNA damage.

==Noncanonical miRNA Function==

Recent study has shown that by miRNA directly targeting the primary transcripts of other miRNA in the nucleus, it can control the biogenesis of the miRNA. A particular example is the miR-709 which negatively regulates the miR-15a/16-1. This particular miR709 is found in the mouse nucleus, and it binds specifically to miR15a/16-1 which are both 19-nucleotide recognition element. It clusters and blocks the processing of primary transcript of miR-15a/16-1 into the precursor. As such it regulates the maturation at a post-transcriptional level, which means post primary transcript but pre precursor.  As such, because miR-709 can regulate the miR-15a/16-1, which in turn regulates the cell apoptosis, the miR-709 indirectly regulates the cell apoptosis. This in turn demonstrates that miRNA can affect the expressions of things within a cell because it can regulate the biogenesis of the other miRNA within the cells.

The miRNA can also regulate the long ncRNA. ncRNA are generally longer than 200 nucleotides and are non-protein-coding transcripts. The first experimental evidence that shows long ncRNAs are functional miRNA targets is shown by Hansen.  In the experiment, the antisense transcript of the cerebellar degeneration related protein 1 (CDR1), which is a circular ncRNA, has been shown to be near perfect complementary with miR-671, which is in the nucleus.  Within the experiment, miR-671 directs the cleavage of the CDR1 antisense transcript in an AGO2-dependent manner.  Thus, with the negative regulation of the circular antisense ncRNA, it also decreases the CDR1 sense transcript. The study down shows that the antisense RNA can be destabilized by the miRNA through the AGO2 -mediated cleavage, and the sense mRNA can be stabilized by the circular noncoding antisense RNA.

== miRISCs and Its Components ==

miRNA combine with Argonaute proteins and GW182 proteins to form miRNA-induced silencing complexes, or miRISCs. AGO attach to the N-terminus of the GW182 protein, while the miRNA bond to the AGO. The GW182 protein seems to be the more important of the two, as it contains the main silencing region. This was discovered when miRNA induced repression was still effective even after the knockoff of AGO in ''Drosophila'' cells. 

== miRNA Inhibition of Translation==
miRNA possess several methods of inhibiting translation. Suppression can occur both before and post translation, although the former method seems to be preferred.   
=== Before Initiation===
# miRISC can suppress translation by interfering with the reading of 5' eIF4F-cap structure. The miRNA prevents the ribosome from reading the cap, thus initiation never starts. On the other hand, mRNA that were able to translate without the cap recognition step were not suppressed by the miRNA.
# miRNA are also able to prevent the creation of a functional ribosomal unit. On normal mRNA, the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunit come together to form the 80S complex, which helps translate the mRNA. miRNA inhibit 60S from joining with the 40S unit, making mRNA translation impossible. Translation is never able to start.
=== Post Initiation===
# miRNA blocks the elongation of the new RNA being translated.
# The ribosome is forced to drop-off from the mRNA. The 40S and 60S ribosomal units split up before translation is complete.
# The miRNA induce preteolysis of the newly transcribed polypeptide chain. The chain is broken up by enzymes.
The mechanisms for the three post initiation inhibitors are known.
 
==miRNA stability==
In contrast to the suggestion in the past that miRNAs are highly stable, recent researches have shown that individual miRNAs in certain environments are subject to accelerated decay, which alters miRNA levels so that affects its activity.&lt;ref&gt;Großhans, Rüegger . &quot;MicroRNA turnover: when, how, and why. [Trends Biochem Sci. 2012] - PubMed - NCBI.&quot; National Center for Biotechnology Information. N.p., n.d. Web. 6 Dec. 2012. &lt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22921610&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt; 

During miRNA biogenesis, miRNAs are transcribed by polymerase II as primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) and the are matured in a multi-step biogenesis process to produce the mature and functional miRNA form. In one case, the pri-miRNAs are captured by polyaldenylated and are quite long (several kilibases long). Pri-miRNAs possess hairpin structures which includes the mature sequence of miRNA in their stem. In another case, the precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) can be kept in introns of mRNAs or other non-coding RNAs. In either of these two cases, the nuclear RNAse type III enzyme Drosha in a complex with co-factor DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8 homolog (DGCR8), cleaves near the base stem which releases about 70 nucleotides pre-miRNA.&lt;ref&gt;Krol, J. et al. (2010) The widespread regulation of microRNA biogenesis, function and decay. Nat. Rev. Genet. 11, 597–610&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deadenylation and Decay==
In deadenylation, the miRNA binds to AGO, GW182, and also poly(A)-binding protein (PABP). The PABP attaches to the GW182 protein, forming a slightly different miRISC. The miRISC removes the 5'-cap from the mRNA, which immediately causes decay of the mRNA. Deadenylation is effective because it rids the cell of excess mRNA, eliminating the chance of accidental translation. The decayed fragments are collected by the P bodies, and reused by the miRNA.

The degradation of miRNAs occurs under the aid of several miRNA-degrading enzymes. Many miRNA-degrading enzymes have been determined including both 3'to 5' and 5' to 3' exoribonucleases. Recent researches have shown that certain RNases were found to take the role in the turnover process of different sets of miRNAs in different organisms. However, the substrate specificity and phylogenetic conservation of individual miRNA turnover enzyme are still in the need of researching.&lt;ref&gt;Großhans, Rüegger . &quot;MicroRNA turnover: when, how, and why. [Trends Biochem Sci. 2012] - PubMed - NCBI.&quot; National Center for Biotechnology Information. N.p., n.d. Web. 6 Dec. 2012. &lt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22921610&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt;

==microRNA-206 and Synapse Repair==
In a mouse model of ALS: When mice get ALS, production of microRNA-206 is induced/increased. Deficiency of microRNA-206 accelerates the progression of the disease.
-MicroRNA-206 is required for regeneration of damaged neuromuscular synapses (the signals between muscle and nerve cells). When synapse is damaged, microRNA-206 turns on repair. Without miRNA-206, synapses cannot be repaired; however, some synapses can grow back.
-MicroRNA-206 does this through histone deacetylase and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathways. Growth factors are specific signals from other cells that tell the cell to grow. 
-MicroRNA-206 blocks translation. It then activates histone deacetylation which condenses chromatin, therefore blocks transcription.
-MicroRNA-206 slows the progression of ALS by repairing neuromuscular synapses.      

MicroRNA genes are found in intergenic regions. These regions have its own miRNA gene promoter and regulatory units. Approximately forty percent of miRNA genes are lie in the introns of the proteins coding, non-proteins coding, and even in the exons.  The miRNAs are found in the orientation that are regulated together with its own host gene. Between forty-two to fifty percent of other miRNA genes were shown in a common promoter, which originate from polycistronic units. The polycistronic units have a discrete loops of 3-6 where the mature miRNAs are being processed, but the miRNAs family are not homologous structure function. Hence, the promoters have a few identical motifs to other genes promoters that were transcribed protein coding genes from the RNA polymerase II. Also, in the DNA template does not have the finish during the mature miRNA production, because there is about five percent of human miRNAs shows RNA editing. The site-specific modification of RNA sequences to yield products different from those encoded by their DNA. The yield of the product allows to increases the diversity, the scope of miRNA action implied from the genome alone.

== miRNAs and Disease ==

=== Cancer ===
Recent studies have shown that miRNAs are involved in causing diseases. In the case of cancer, researchers found that miRNAs can inhibit the E2F1 protein that regulates cell proliferation. miRNAs bind to the mRNA first before translating the E2F1 protein.
One microRNA, miR-21, was labeled as the first oncomir. It is known to aid in tumor growth and metastasis by targeting natural occurring tumor suppressors in the human body. Tropomyosin 1 (TPM1) is a direct target of miR-21, along with programmed cell death 4(PDCD4) and maspin, all of which are inversely correlated with the expression of miR-21 in the presence of tumors. This shows that miR-21 has the ability to target multiple genes and inhibit multiple metabolic pathways at the same time. 

=== Kidney Fibrosis ===
Renal fibrosis is the excessive accumulation of fibrous tissues (connective tissues), occurring as a reparative process after scarring or trauma to the kidney. This type of nephropathy directly promotes renal dysfunction, which ultimately leads to kidney failure and death. Study has shown that a certain microRNA, miR-21, shows significant elevation in expression during the progression of kidney scarring. Experiments were conducted to validate this specific sequence and its effect in mice.

The abrogation of miR-21 in mice showed no overt abnormalities and no obvious suppression/prevention of tumor growths; however, these mice developed far less interstitial scarring tissue in response to kidney injury. Analysis has detected groups of genes and their subsequent metabolic pathways that were inhibited by miR-21. One of which involves peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- α(Pparα), which is a lipid metabolism pathway that incorporates the synthesized anti–miR-21 oligonucleotides to inhibit miR-21. Pparα is found to ease the effects of ureteral-obstruction induced kidney fibrosis. miR-21 also regulates the redox metabolic pathway that involves a protein called Mpv171. The repression of Mpv171 in cells enhances kidney damage by reducing the production of oxygen radicals. 

These studies demonstrate that miR-21 has a broad spectrum of influences on the microscopic scale and can be a suitable target for antifibrotic and cancer therapies.

===Heart Disease===

Another studies have shown miRNA inhibits the maturation in the murine heart, and plays an essential role during its development. The expression level of the miRNA is been changed in the disease of the human heart; it is the involvement in cardiomyopathies. During the heart disease development, they were several specific miRNAs that were been identified in animal models that were mostly in mice under pathological conditions. Those specific miRNA conditions key factors are important for cardiogenesis, the hypertrophic growth response, and cardiac conductance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The original Carpaccio was made by Guiseppe Cipriani in his restaurant Harry's Bar in Venice, Italy in the 1950s. The dish is named after the Italian painter. These days, of course, there exists 1000s of different carpaccio recipes, and the word is even used now to describe all dishes that consists of the main ingredient being sliced very finely. But the original dish consisted of beef and a mustard-flavoured mayonese only. No pine nuts, parmesan etc.</text>

== You have been warned/Recent edits ==

Just to put the record straight: I did not realize the users pages are not to be edited.
The corrections I made were changing vandalizim to vandalism and vanadlize to vandalize.
Comments I received were that Red4tribe is from the USA, '''so the spelling was correct'''.
My American Merriam-Webster dictionary confirms my corrections to be in order.
Please advise.

'''Telecentre (noun):''' A Telecentre is a public place where people can access computers, the Internet, and other digital technologies that enable them to gather information, create, learn, and communicate with others while they develop essential digital skills. While each Telecentre is different, their common focus is on the use of digital technologies to support community, economic, educational, and social development—reducing isolation, bridging the digital divide, promoting health issues, creating economic opportunities, and reaching out to youth for example.

Telecentres exist in almost every country, although they sometimes go by a different name: public Internet access center (PIAP), village knowledge center, Infocenter, community technology center (CTC), community multimedia center (CMC), multipurpose community Telecentre (MCT), Common/Citizen Service Centre (CSC), school-based Telecentre, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia definition of a “Telecentre”

I am sure the community would like to see one definitive textbook on it's [[WB:FB|featured book list]].

;[[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]]
:The [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]] has reached a major milestone today, 30 days shy of its third birthday: the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Nature|Nature Series]] now has answers to every single requirement of every one of its 75 honors.  Overall, there are 206 completed honors in nine categories, and 354 honors in all.  It has been a tremendous amount of work, and I have enjoyed every single moment I have spent working on it.  I want to thank everyone who has contributed to the project, including many on Wikipedia who don't ''know'' they contributed.  I imported a lot of material from there and morphed it to suit this book's needs. At the current rate of work, I expect the book as a whole to be completed in about another three years.

Clustering techniques have a wide use and importance nowadays. This importance tends to increase as the amount of data grows and the processing power of the computers increases. Clustering applications are used extensively in various fields such as artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, economics, ecology, psychiatry and marketing.

The main purpose of clustering techniques is to partitionate a set of entities into different groups, called clusters. These groups may be consistent in terms of similarity of its members. As the name suggests, the representative-based clustering techniques uses some form of representation for each cluster. Thus, every group has a member that represents it. The motivation to use such clustering techniques is the fact that, besides reducing the cost of the algorithm, the use of representatives makes the process easier to understand. There are many decisions that have to be made in order to use the strategy of representative-based clustering. For example, there is an obvious trade-off between the number of clusters and the internal cohesion of them. If there are few clusters, the internal cohesion tends to be small. Otherwise, a large number of clusters makes them very close, so that there is little difference between adjacent groups. Another decision is whether the clusters should be mutually exclusive or not, that is, if an entity can co-exist in more than one cluster at the same time.

= Technique to be discussed =

In this work, we focus on K-Means algorithm, which is probably the most popular technique of representative-based clustering. In the first section, we give a brief explanation of how the algorithm works.

== Algorithm ==

K-Means is a simple learning algorithm for clustering analysis. The goal of K-Means algorithm is to find the best division of ''n'' entities in ''k'' groups, so that the total distance between the group's members and its corresponding centroid, representative of the group, is minimized. Formally, the goal is to partition the ''n'' entities into ''k'' sets ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, i=1, 2, ..., k'' in order to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS), defined as:


&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^k \sum_{i=1}^n \parallel x_{i}^j - c_j \parallel ^2&lt;/math&gt;


where term &lt;math&gt;\parallel x_{i}^j - c_j \parallel&lt;/math&gt; provides the distance between an entity point and the cluster's centroid.

The most common algorithm, described below, uses an iterative refinement approach, following these steps:

* Define the initial groups' centroids. This step can be done using different strategies. A very common one is to assign random values for the centroids of all groups. Another approach is to use the values of ''K'' different entities as being the centroids.
* Assign each entity to the cluster that has the closest centroid. In order to find the cluster with the most similar centroid, the algorithm must calculate the distance between all the entities and each centroid.
* Recalculate the values of the centroids. The values of the centroid's fields are updated, taken as the average of the values of the entities' attributes that are part of the cluster.
* Repeat steps 2 and 3 iteratively until entities can no longer change groups.

The K-Means is a greedy, computationally efficient technique, being the most popular representative-based clustering algorithm. The pseudocode of the K-Means algorithm is shown below.

[[File:Algorithm_kmeans.png]]

== Implementation ==

In order to use the K-Means algorithm in R, one must have the ''stats'' package installed. This package includes a function that performs the K-Mean process, according to different algorithms. These algorithms are described below:

* '''Lloyd'''

:Given any set of k centers Z, for each center z in Z, let V(z) denote its neighborhood. That is the set of data points for which z is the nearest neighbor. Each stage of Lloyd's algorithm moves every center point z to the centroid of V(z) and then updates V(z) by recomputing the distance from each point to its nearest center. These steps are repeated until convergence. Note that Lloyd's algorithm can get stuck in locally minimal solutions that are far from the optimal. For this reason it is common to consider heuristics based on local search, in which centers are swapped in and out of an existing solution (typically at random). Such a swap is accepted only if it decreases the average distortion, otherwise it is ignored.

* '''Forgy'''

:Forgy's algorithm is a simple alternating least-squares algorithm consisting of the following steps:

:* Initialize the codebook vectors. (Suppose that when processing a given training case, N cases have been previously assigned to the winning codebook vector.)
:* Repeat the following two steps until convergence:
:*# Read the data, assigning each case to the nearest (using Euclidean distance) codebook vector.
:*# Replace each codebook vector with the mean of the cases that were assigned to it.

* '''MacQueen'''

:This algorithm works by repeatedly moving all cluster centers to the mean of their respective Voronoi sets.

* '''Hartigan and Wong'''

:Given n objects with p variables measured on each object x(i,j) for i = 1,2,...,n; j = 1,2,...,p; K-means allocates each object to one of K groups or clusters to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares:

:&lt;math&gt;Sum(k) = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} \sum_{j = 0}^{p}{(x(i,j) - \overline{x(k,j)})^2}&lt;/math&gt;


:where &lt;math&gt;\overline{x(k,j)}&lt;/math&gt; is the mean variable j of all elements in group K.

:In addition to the data matrix, a K x p matrix giving the initial cluster centers for the K clusters is required. The objects are then initially allocated to the cluster with the nearest cluster mean. Given the initial allocation, the procedure is to iteratively search for the K-partition with locally optimal within-cluster sum of squares by moving points from one cluster to another.


The K-Means function, provided by the ''stats'' package, might be used as follow:

 kmeans(x, centers, iter.max = 10, nstart = 1, algorithm = c(&quot;Hartigan-Wong&quot;, &quot;Lloyd&quot;, &quot;Forgy&quot;, &quot;MacQueen&quot;))

where the arguments are:

* '''x:''' A numeric matrix of data, or an object that can be coerced to such a matrix (such as a numeric vector or a data frame with all numeric columns).
* '''centers:''' Either the number of clusters or a set of initial (distinct) cluster centers. If a number, a random set of (distinct) rows in x is chosen as the initial centers.
* '''iter.max:''' The maximum number of iterations allowed.
* '''nstart:''' If ''centers'' is a number, ''nstart'' gives the number of random sets that should be chosen.
* '''algorithm:''' The algorithm to be used. It should be one of &quot;Hartigan-Wong&quot;, &quot;Lloyd&quot;, &quot;Forgy&quot; or &quot;MacQueen&quot;. If no algorithm is specified, the algorithm of Hartigan and Wong is used by default.

If everything goes OK, an object of class ''kmeans'' is returned. This object has the following components:

* '''cluster:''' A vector of integers indicating the cluster to which each point is allocated.
* '''centers:''' A matrix of cluster centers.
* '''whithnss:''' The within-cluster sum of squares for each cluster.
* '''size:''' The number of points in each cluster.

== View == 

There are actually two ways of viewing the result of a K-Means use. Both of them use the object of class ''kmeans'' returned by the function application.

The first way is to plot the object, creating a chart that represents the data. Thus, if there are N objects divided into K clusters, the chart must contain N points representing the objects, and those points must be colored in K different colors, each one representing a cluster set. For example, given the object ''km'', which is a result of the function ''kmeans'' application, all one has to do in order to plot the object is:

 plot(km)

The second way of viewing the result of a K-Means application is to simply print the components of the object of class ''kmeans''. For example, given the same object ''km'' of the previous example, one could print its components using:

 print(km)

'''Example'''

Suppose we have four objects and each object have two attributes (or features), as shown in table below.


{| border=1
  |+ Table 1: ''Table representing objects''
|-
  ! Object
  ! Attribute X
  ! Attribute Y
|-
  | A
  | 1

|-
  | B
  | 2
  | 1
|-
  | C
  | 4
  | 3
|-
  | D
  | 5
  | 4

|}


Our goal is to group these objects into K=2 groups based on their two features. The function K-Means can be used to define the groups as follow:

&lt;pre&gt;
# prepare matrix of data
cells &lt;- c(1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 4)
rnames &lt;- c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;)
cnames &lt;- c(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;)
x &lt;- matrix(cells, nrow=4, ncol=2, byrow=TRUE, dimnames=list(rnames, cnames))

# run K-Means
km &lt;- kmeans(x, 2, 15)

# print components of km
print(km)

# plot clusters
plot(x, col = km$cluster)
# plot centers
points(km$centers, col = 1:2, pch = 8)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Result of printing components of ''km'':

&lt;pre&gt;
K-means clustering with 2 clusters of sizes 2, 2

Cluster means:
    X   Y
1 1.5 1.0

2 4.5 3.5

Clustering vector:

1 1 2 2

Within cluster sum of squares by cluster:
[1] 0.5 1.0

Available components:
[1] &quot;cluster&quot;  &quot;centers&quot;  &quot;withinss&quot; &quot;size&quot;  
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Case Study ==

In this section, we illustrate a case study using K-Means.

=== Scenario ===

The differences between countries go far beyond the physical and territorial aspects. Hence, for analytical purposes, it is very common to classify countries in groups based on some of their attributes. A traditional classification divides countries into developed, emerging and underdeveloped. In this division, many criteria, such per capita income and life expectancy, can be considered.

The k-means algorithm is a technique for grouping entities according to the similarity of their attributes. As the presenting problem consists of dividing countries into similar groups, it is plausible that K-means can be applied to this task.

Let's consider the scenario where countries need to be classified into the three already mentioned groups: developed, emerging and underdeveloped. To analyze their similarity and assign them to the groups, the following attributes should be taken into account:
* per capita income;
* literacy;
* infant mortality;
* life expectancy;


=== Input data ===

The input data is a table containing the numeric values of attributes for each considered country. The table consists of nineteen lines, representing countries and five columns (including the first containing the name of the country), representing the attributes. The table can be loaded from a spreadsheet or from a text file. To preserve the semantics of the clusters, all the values used in this example are real statistics of the countries.

=== Execution ===

The function &quot;kmeans&quot; can be used to define the groups of countries as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
# import data (assume that all data in &quot;data.txt&quot; is stored as comma separated values)
x &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data.txt&quot;, header=TRUE, row.names=1)

# run K-Means
km &lt;- kmeans(x, 3, 15)
 
# print components of km
print(km)

# plot clusters
plot(x, col = km$cluster)
# plot centers
points(km$centers, col = 1:2, pch = 8)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The value of the second parameter of &quot;kmeans&quot; was passed as the number 3, because we want to get three groups of countries.

=== Output ===

The result of printing the components of the class returned by the function application is shown below:

Available components:

&lt;/pre&gt;

The result of plotting the class returned by the function application is shown below:

[[File:kmeans_plotting2.png]]

5.0 3.5 1.3 0.3 -1
5.5 2.6 4.4 1.2 0
6.7 3.1 5.6 2.4 1
5.0 3.3 1.4 0.2 -1
5.9 3.0 5.1 1.8 1
5.8 2.6 4.0 1.2 0

The implementation of k-means generated three clusters, relatively homogeneous, consisting of 5, 7 and 7 countries. Analyzing the cluster means, we can relate each group with each of the three classes of countries:
* the cluster formed by Germany, United Kingdom, Greece, Australia, Japan, Italy and Sweden, has the highest per capita income, literacy and life expectancy and the lowest infant mortality. So, this cluster represents the developed countries.
* the cluster formed by Mozambique, Georgia, Pakistan, India, Zambia and Namibia has the lowest values for all attributes and, therefore, represents the undeveloped countries.
* the cluster formed by the other countries, Brazil, South Africa, Turkish, Argentina and Lithuania represents the group of emerging countries.

To enhance the quality of the classification made by K-Means, the resulting division of the groups was compared with the classification of all countries by Human Development Index as included in the United Nations Development Program's Human Development Report released on October 5, 2009, compiled on the basis of data from 2007.  The Human Development Index (HDI) is a comparative measure of well-being that considers aspects like life expectancy, literacy, and education. Compared with the division by the HDI, only four countries have been classified into different groups: Namibia, Georgia, Pakistan and India. These countries should have been placed in the &quot;developing&quot; rather than into &quot;undeveloped&quot; group.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Dangers of Travel under Primitive Conditions ==

One can easily imagine the dangers and difficulties of travel under primitive conditions. Land and sea are infested with robbers and murderers. He who goes from settlement to settlement must run the risk of facing outlaws, wild beasts, severity of weather, and starvation. The one taking such chances should be entitled to special consideration in order that intercourse might be promoted. The best classes of men would encourage punishment to outlaws, for the safety of the itinerants. Through travelers, people receive information regarding what is going on in the outside world. There would probably be in such lands no written language. News must be passed from mouth to mouth. Wayfarers must depend upon the clemency and generosity of people along the road, or intercourse must cease. The typical mode of carrying on business in such society is by means of barter. Many classes have no medium of exchange, or, if they have, it is of such a nature that it cannot easily be handled and transported. Stones for hatchet-making, colored clay for paints, skins for clothing, animals, especially oxen and sheep, shells, corn, tobacco, and various other substances have been used extensively, either in primitive America or elsewhere; so to offer these in payment for lodging would be usually inconvenient and often impossible.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Foreword'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

I am heartened that telecentre networks have immortalized what they have learned from experience about network building and management since 2005, especially because there is no longer any dispute: networks are the new normal for organizing and managing telecentres successfully. As such, this initiative represents a major contribution by and for networks, as well as for the global telecentre community at large.

The resulting Network Management Guide addresses practical issues that networks face on a daily basis. It discusses the challenges and proposes solutions from the practitioners’ perspectives. As a living document, constantly updated through wiki posts, the guide encourages the telecentre community to engage in building stronger telecentres together and to share experiences and perspectives for many years to come.

I would like to thank the network leaders and practitioners who dedicated their time to write the various chapters in this guide. They are: José Avando Souza Sales (ATN Brazil), Sulah Ndaula (UgaBytes, Uganda), Aminata Fofana (Afriklinks, Mali), Mahmud Hasan (Bangladesh Telecentre Network), Maria Teresa M. Camba (PhilCeCNet, Philippines), Kemly Camacho (Sula Batsu, Costa Rica), Paula M. Carrión (Infodesarrollo, Ecuador), and Manuel Acevedo (ICT4D consultant, Argentina). I extend my deepest appreciation too to the members of the telecentre.org community that reviewed and provided useful feedback to these authors.

This guide was co-edited by Manuel Acevedo (Argentina), Claire Buré (Chile), Silvia Caicedo and myself (telecentre.org, Canada). It is published by telecentre.org ([http://www.telecentre.org www.telecentre.org]) and is available online and (coming soon) as a living wiki.
Finally, this guide represents the very best of what telecentre.org and the telecentre movement is all about: working together to share experiences and best practices with a view to making telecentres strong, better, more sustainable and more relevant to the people they serve.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Congratulations. I'm proud to be and work in your company.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction: A new publication about Telecentre Networks ==

&lt;center&gt;'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; Manuel Acevedo Ruiz&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''&lt;/center&gt;

Community telecentres, or simply ‘telecentres’ as they are widely known, have existed since the mid 1980s in Scandinavia, Canada and the United States – for almost as long as the internet has been available to the general public. They became more widespread in the late 1990s with their deployment in developing countries, as the strategic importance for human development of universal access to information and communication services became more accepted by policy-makers around the world. In 1997, the United Nations called for universal access to ICT services:

{{cquote|

We have concluded that the introduction and use of ICT and information management must become an integral element of the priority efforts by

the United Nations system to promote and secure sustainable human development for all; hence our decision to embrace the objective of establishing universal access to basic communication and information services for all (UN Administrative and Coordinating Committee). }}

In many countries in the world, the only viable way to reach universal access for the time being and in the mid-future is though shared access, particularly for people who are impoverished. As C.K. Prahalad notes&lt;ref&gt; C.K. Prahalad has become well known for his ideas about extending empowerment and consumption to poor individuals at the ‘Bottom of the Pyramid’, a term made popular in his book “The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty through Profits” (2006, Wharton School Publishing). &lt;/ref&gt;:

{{cquote|

The search for a solution to this problem has focused on different forms of shared access, in which public computers are made available in

supportive environments, usually with the user paying only for the amount of time he or she uses it. The actual models under which this

approach is organized are as diverse as the bottom of the pyramid itself, but for the sake of simplicity, it is called telecentres (in Fillip &amp; Foote, p. i).

}}

Since the mid 2000s a new player for universal access has arrived on the scene: the mobile phone. And it is the only imaginable digital device connectable to the internet that can bring universal ICT access in the foreseeable future (individually or even at the family level). Yet, while their capabilities are growing by leaps and bounds, mobile phones still present significant limitations (small screens, restricted inputs, high costs for connectivity, etc.).

This points to a different, more integral understanding of the meaning of universal access. Just as the concept of ‘digital divide’ evolved from being strictly related to infrastructure to one combining infrastructure, capacity and content (Acevedo, 2005), we can talk of ‘effective universal access’ which isn’t just about devices; but rather integrates devices, goods, services and context to allow people to make effective use of ICTs. Telecentres continue to play a key role in allowing greater levels of connectivity, becoming even more important as the diversity and complexity of ICT goods and services grows. Telecentres help constituencies to gain ICT capacity, to find relevant content, to make use of a growing range of services and to connect with other users (across towns or across the world), all within the ‘supportive environment’ outlined earlier by Prahalad. Therefore, as telecentres are shifting to becoming community resources for human development, reaching beyond their initial recognition as technology access points, they will be increasingly recognized as fundamental actors in spreading the benefits and opportunities of ICT use&lt;ref&gt; In fact, more advanced definitions of digital divide refer to the inequity in access to the benefits and opportunities make possible through ICTs. &lt;/ref&gt;.

Once the first telecentres were launched in a given country, particularly in developing nations during the mid-to-late 1990s&lt;ref&gt; The first telecentres were often launched with the support of international cooperation agencies, in the context of ICT for Development programs. &lt;/ref&gt;, some practitioners and policy makers turned their attention to how to bring those telecentres together so they could share experiences, information, training materials, etc. Low performance caused many ‘early casualties’ among the first waves of telecentres. Telecentre networking became an important issue, at least on paper, even before large national scaling-up of telecentres started. But it wasn’t easy and it would take time.

Up until a few years ago, most telecentres were fairly isolated from one another. Even national initiatives that were born with the intention of being networked, such as in Jordan starting in 2000, essentially functioned as individual telecentres which only shared program managers and funding. Even discussions among national telecentre associations (mostly in Latin America) in December 2001 on the eve of a Global Citizens Networks Congress in Buenos Aires did not lead to any significant results or advances. However, this event probably did help to pave the way towards more extensive networking, a way that was significantly facilitated by the strings of meetings and contacts made possible by the process of the World Summit on the Information Society (2003 – 2005). It was really with the start of the

telecentre.org initiative (starting in 2006) that significant advances in telecentre networking were realized, via an open, organized and deliberate effort that was global in scope and reach.

 

=== How do we recognize a telecentre network when we see one? ===

Is it possible to provide a unified definition of a telecentre network (TCN)? Perhaps, but since the nature of this publication is more practical than academic, we prefer to characterize telecentre networks through the attributes that commonly appear. After all, telecentre networks can vary significantly from country to country: sometimes they are informal arrangements, linking a few dozens of telecentres, while others are highly structured national programs that include hundreds of individual telecentres. 

Meddie Mayanja, from the telecentre.org program initiative, provides a description of some of the key attributes of a telecentre network:

* An '''alliance of practitioners''' (who believe in the power of working together to learn and find solutions for their problems);
* '''A forum for exchange''' of ideas and experiences; and
* A '''platform for actio'''n to increase social and economic impact of grassroots telecentres (Mayanja, 2008).

In addition, we could say that a telecentre network fosters the collaboration of telecentres, helps to represent them and channels their voices, also serving as a dynamic repository of resources for its member telecentres. More broadly, networks strengthen the entire telecentre ecosystem — acting as connection points between key players and sustaining relationships between activists, researchers, and development partners.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.telecentre.org/notes/Network_support www.telecentre.org/notes/Network_support] for more information.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some network parameters, applied to telecentre networks can help to characterize them, include the following characteristics:

*  '''Size:''' Networks can consist of up to 100 nodes, 100 – 500, over 500;
*  '''Regional coverage:''' Can be local, state/provincial, national, regional, global;
*  '''Maturity:''' Can describe stages from ‘infancy’ (up to 2 years),‘adolescence’ (2-4 yrs), and ‘adulthood’ (after 5 yrs)&lt;ref&gt;  The process of maturity may also include a period of decline, as observed in many networks. However, instead of leading to the ‘death’ of a network, this stage may often lead to transformation, critical re-shaping or inclusion into a larger network.  &lt;/ref&gt;
*  '''Institutionality:''' Can range from formal to semi-formal to informal. 

Most telecentre network practitioners will find their network’s characteristics  among the attributes mentioned. Other network characteristics and behaviours are described in more depth in Chapter 10.

=== But what exactly do you mean by a 'network'?  ===
Networks are currently fashionable. Everyone is in a network (or sometimes in many), and all sorts of organizations describe themselves as ‘networked’. We may even take networks for granted, given their ubiquity. But as it happens with other all-too important concepts, such as ‘quality’ or ‘excellence’, the concept ends up devoid of meaning. As Kilduff and Tsai (2008) note: 

{{cquote|

''Sometimes it appears that the network paradigm is in danger of becoming a victim of its own success – invoked by practically every organizational researcher, included in almost every analysis, and yet strangely absent as a distinctive set of ideas (p. 9).''

}}

It is thus appropriate to briefly pause in order to convey a common understanding of the concept of a network, without going into theoretical vagaries. If we are going to talk, analyze and make decisions about networks,t is worth thinking about what it actually means, even while recognizing that there are numerous interpretations of what a network entails. At its most basic level, a network can be understood as set of connected nodes. The nodes interact via some type of connection or channel: it could be an electronic link, or a ‘physical’ chat while having tea. Each node and connection can exhibit different characteristics. For example, nodes may vary in terms of

responsibility or influence, while connections may differ in intensity or in terms of the transactions they allow&lt;ref&gt; There are many ways to characterize nodes and connections, such as indicated in Anheir &amp; Katz (2005, 2006).  &lt;/ref&gt;.

The ‘'''connected'''’ attribute is fundamental. A network exists as long as there is interaction among its nodes, be they persons, units or organizations. The interaction can take various forms: information sharing, transactions, projects, campaigns, etc. Just like a bicycle needs constant movement to stay upright, so does a set of nodes need to be actively connected in order to constitute a network. In other words, some nodes in a network will be acting together at any given time. Otherwise they simply make up what we can generally call a ‘group’, for reasons of identity, interests or affinities. We can express this as a simple formula: '''Network = Group + Joint Activities'''.

Networks do not particularly need a centre, though they often have one or more sets of concentrated nodes that can be called ‘hubs’. In comparison with more traditional or hierarchical organization structures, networks tend to be more flexible and modulable. They may also be more efficient, such as for the distribution of information.

As will be mentioned in the final chapter, there are various ways to describe or characterize networks, with associated techniques to analyze them. For now, it is helpful to distinguish between '''social networks''' (those between individuals) and organizational networks (those between or within entities, the latter when they are large). '''Organizational networks''' typically have one or more explicit purposes, while social networks chiefly serve to communicate between people. Additionally, an organizational network displays a productive nature; it produces something concrete (making it more than a set of contacts). Telecentre networks can, for these reasons, be described as organizational networks. 

==== Telecentre networks, ecosystems, or what...? ====
For practical purposes, it is worthwhile to extend the view of a telecentre network to that of a telecentre ecosystem, a term coined by telecentre.org in 2006. A telecentre ecosystem recognizes actors both within and outside the telecentre network, as Figure 1.1 illustrates below. 

&lt;!-- ------------- figure 1.1 ------------ --&gt;
[[File:Figure 4.1 Internal Communication Cycle.png|thumb|450px|center|Figure 4.1 Internal Communication Cycle]]
&lt;!-- ------------- figure 1.1 ------------ --&gt;

A narrow view of a telecentre network would only include telecentres, leaving out other relevant actors (like universities, or a municipal administration, for example). A more accurate, open view would include these outside actors as well, in an broader telecentre network. After all, network geometries are based more on collaboration than strictly on nodal identity: it is more important what do you do than who you are. It is this second, more open interpretation of telecentre networks that will be used in this Guidebook, recognizing non- telecentre actors as another type of node that can participate in network activities in various ways. This topic will be covered in greater detail in the next section under ‘Other actors in telecentre networks’.  

If a telecentre network could be seen as a club, what is important here is not whether we would formally initiate non-telecentre actors as ‘full members with voting-rights’ or whether we grant them only with temporary passes to the club. What matters is to realize their potential for collaboration in order to achieve the objectives of our telecentre networks.

Currently, national governments, businesses, international organizations and civil society are the protagonists in the telecentre movement. Generally speaking, governments tend to lead the development and implementation of public policies in ICT, while the private sector enables and finances actions aligned with their corporate strategies. International organizations (as represented by UN agencies like the United Nations Development Programme, UNESCO or the International Telecommunications Union, development banks or by entities such as the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) in Canada bring resources and share knowledge for better management of telecentre networks. And in a growing number of cases, it is the responsibility of civil society to manage telecentre networks.

=== Others actors in telecentre networks ===
As mentioned before, telecentre ecosystems can include many different kinds of entities that can contribute to and become active within telecentre networks, acting as nodes in those networks. Let’s take a look at their possible roles now, while keeping in mind that networks can always benefit from the contributions of additional genuine supporters. 

* '''Universities:''' Universities provide the skills for future engineers, managers, doctors, sociologists and other professionals in a country. They also help to educate people to be citizens in a more harmonious society. Given this double motive, universities are well placed to be important partners for TCNs. A national collaborative arrangement would benefit from having students hone their ICT technical skills while supporting telecentres as a work placement (such as through a summer job, or an internship) or online, by providing help desk support, for example &lt;ref&gt; This kind of exchange was done in Canada at the University of Cape Breton with one of the earlier telecentre programs in the province of Nova Scotia in the late 1990s. &lt;/ref&gt;Students and professors can also help to provide or adapt training content in thematic areas of interest to telecentres (relating to agriculture, health, trade, civil rights, etc.). Universities can also help conduct valuable research for telecentre networks, which few other institutions may be in a position to do.

* '''Businesses:''' As part of their Corporate Social Responsibility programs, or even without them, companies can contribute to the operations of a telecentre network. They can provide technical/management expertise, equipment, connectivity and, very importantly, the collaboration of corporate volunteers. Companies can also facilitate the entry of TCNs into specific development projects they are involved with. ICT companies such as Microsoft, Telefónica or Cisco (or smaller ones) can play valuable roles.

* '''Development agencies/ Development NGOs:''' Both multilateral entities (such as the UNDP, UNESCO, ITU, IDRC, Soros Foundation) and bilateral entities (the UK’s DFID, Swiss SDC, or Spain’s Intermon-Oxfam), have supported the telecentre movement for years, and continue to play significant roles. One good example was the ITU with their ‘Multipurpose Community Telecentres’&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/univ_access/telecentres/ www.itu.int/ITU-D/univ_access/telecentres]
&lt;/ref&gt;. These organizations are well placed to examine experiences around the world, and together with telecentre practitioners, distill knowledge that can be applied to advance the work and performance of these networks.

* '''Media:''' With the advent of a web 2.0 internet environment, media channels have multiplied and extended their reach to new communities. The media can provide special types of contributions to telecentre networks: (i) increasing the visibility of telecentres for the general public and specialized audiences, (ii) strengthening the public communications capacity of TCNs, and (iii) enriching the role of telecentres as consumers/providers of news and information flowing through media change.

* '''Governments:''' The myriad of possible contributions of public administration to telecentres and telecentre networks is well recognized. What is worth mentioning here is that their participation as (powerful) members of telecentre ecosystems can occur simultaneously atnational levels (i.e. with telecentre networks) or locally, with municipal administrations providing support to local telecentres. One particularly interesting area of government involvement in terms of content and services would be to impulse large-scale e-government service initiatives where telecentres are utilized as the main means of delivery.

As we will see in Chapter 10, effective telecentre network management can help to arrange and map the contributions of these non-telecentre actors to obtain joint virtuous network effects. For this, careful consideration needs to be exercised in relation to (i) each actor’s possible functions, (ii) TCN management aspects (as covered in Chapters 2-8) and (iii) the collaborative actions between them (such as between an ICT business consortium and a national university). The key aim is to derive added value from their participation, while avoiding a multiplicity of isolated contributions.

=== Why do telecentre networks matter? ===

Regardless of a telecentre network’s specific characteristics, most practitioners have an instinctive sense of its benefits for a given telecentre, as well as for the ‘community’, (i.e. the network entity itself), which will include some of the following:

* Pooling of financial and technological resources – for example, being able to negotiate better connectivity costs;
* Improved access to knowledge and information;
* Wider distribution channels for content and services;
* Enhanced collaboration – for exmple, in undertaking a joint project among a number of individual telecentres;
* Decentralized orientation – such as implementing collective decisions through coordinated actions at the local level;
* Mutual support and risk reduction – such as when facing financial blackouts from donors or unfriendly legislation;
* Support for smaller players (not all telecentres have similar structures or ‘health’);
* More flexibility, from the nature of functioning as a network (as opposed to a mere association of telecentres); and
* More effective representation stemming from a stronger capacity to interact with higher order entities, like a government. For example, interacting with a government’s ministry to influence national ICTn policies with socially inclusive measures – which could never be achieved by a single telecentre or even a loose group of them.

From experience, practitioners know that participation in such networks involves a cost in terms of time, human resources and to some extent, money. The challenge lies in achieving the expected benefits from participation in a network in ways that outweigh the costs.

These benefits will not emerge spontaneously, and even if they did, they would be limited and ad-hoc. Networks are not self-managing; there is no kind of automatic pilot that keeps them going without intervention. Network management of any type (including for telecentres) is a relatively new style of management. Its added difficulty is that most of us were brought up in more hierarchical or traditional environments (whether in school, at work, in the family or in society at large). Most of the time we use ‘trial-and-error’ to come up with appropriate strategies and practices to help our networks reach the potential we intuitively think they have. These reasons lead us to try advancing our understanding of telecentre network management, the main theme of this document, with its specific issues and factors.

=== A brief story on telecentre.org ===

telecentre.org is a worldwide network of people and organizations committed to increasing the social and economic impact of tens of thousands of grassroots telecentres by making telecentres stronger, more vibrant, and better at what they do. It helps to fuel a global movement that helps people in communities in every corner of the world join the knowledge society on their own terms. By investing in the networks and organizations that work directly with telecentres, telecentre.org makes a difference around the world, helping to improve communities and empowering people.

The telecentre.org program initiative was launched in November 2005 at the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis. It is the product of a joint social investment program by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Microsoft and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). The program provides grants and technical assistance to telecentre networks and organizations around the world. Currently housed at the IDRC in Ottawa, Canada, key functions of the social investment program are increasingly being carried out by partners around the world.

But telecentre.org is much more than a social investment program. It is a community that gathers people and organizations from around the world who believe that telecentres have an important role to play in development. This group is made up of telecentre managers, network leaders, nonprofit and civil society organizations; corporations, governments and international development agencies — all working together to increase the social and economic impact of grassroots telecentres around the world.

Telecentre networks are the nerve and connectors of these complex web of interdependent relationships aimed at helping telecentres to create stronger social and economic impacts in communities they serve. Partners share experiences, skills, innovations and resources.

&lt;font color=&quot;OrangeRed&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''''We Will…'''''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Train &lt;font color=&quot;OrangeRed&quot;&gt;'''''one million knowledge workers'''''&lt;/font&gt; by the year 2015.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

telecentre.org doubles as a development project on ICT4D and as a network in its own right. And for the purposes of this guidebook it has the advantage of being familiar to many people who form part of telecentre networks around the world.

telecentre.org implements its activities in four main programmatic pillars; namely, '''Research, telecentre.org Academy, Content and services and Networking'''. It considers &lt;u&gt;capacity building&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;knowledge sharing&lt;/u&gt; to be crosscutting themes. telecentre.org deliberately exploits the virtuous network effects of these pillars, as in most cases they complement and fortify the others. Figure 1.2 illustrates the relationship among these program components, which can be described as ‘symbiotic’ (Mayanja, 2008).

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;!-- ------------- figure 1.2 ------------ --&gt;
[[File:Figure 1.2 Network strategies and other telecentre.org program pillars.png|thumb|400px|center|Figure 1.2 Network strategies and other telecentre.org program pillars]]
&lt;!-- ------------- figure 1.2 ------------ --&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

The ‘Network’ pillar of telecentre.org is critical to the overall success of the program. The national and regional networks that it supports provide a trusted channel to grassroots telecentres, who are the ultimate beneficiaries and stakeholders of the telecentre.org program.

telecentre.org therefore takes a double-pronged approach to networking: on one hand, it tries to mainstream networking across all its program areas. On the other hand, it includes a specific networking component to stimulate and fine-tune networked operations.

=== Another book on telecentres...? ===

The telecentre.org program had in fact already previously made a strategic decision to throw its weight towards supporting TCNs&lt;ref&gt;This is coherent with the strategy shown by its parent organization, IDRC, in supporting development networks of many types.&lt;/ref&gt;. Its ‘Network Development Support’ strategy is aimed at obtaining technical support for institutional development and sustainability planning of TCNs. This guidebook is one of the products of that strategy. This is coherent with the strategy shown by its parent organization, IDRC, in supporting development networks of many types.

A resource document providing systematized information and proven knowledge about networks is imperative to help us get the most out of telecentre networks, so that individual telecentres can better serve their users and communities. This is the primary reason that led the men and women who attended the Telecentre Leaders’ Forum in Kuala Lumpur in December 2007 to advocate for the publication of a document about effectively managing telecentre networks. Appropriately, these same individuals requested the networked organization of which they are now a part. 

While there is already a sizable and substantive bibliography about telecentres&lt;ref&gt;See earlier work from IDRC’s Richard Fuchs (“If You Have a Lemon, Make Lemonade”), Mike Jensen in Africa (“Afriboxes, telecentres, cybercafes: ICT in Africa”), Chasquinet in Latin America (“Telecentros… ¿Para Qué?”) or wide-ranging research done by Colle and Roman at Cornell University, as well as other new, notable publications such as “Making the Connection: Scaling Telecenters for Development” (Filip &amp; Foote, 2008) by AED (Academy for Educational Development), supported by telecentre.org. &lt;/ref&gt;(of which a selection is included in this publication), few works can be found that focus on telecentre networks. Of those, fewer still concentrate on managing those networks.

The guidebook is the first publication dedicated exclusively to telecentre network management. It is not just another publication about telecentres: it is about how effectively create and thrive in networks. We hope it will be a useful resource to better structure and handle telecentre networks for its target audience, which includes (i) people managing a telecentre network, (ii) managers and operators of telecentres that belong to a network; (iii) managers and operators of telecentres which do yet belong to a network; (iv) organizations that provide services to telecentres; and (v) ICT/information society policy makers. We’ll be glad as well if it provides food for thought to anyone interested in telecentres and development networks.

There are additional reasons for the creation of this guidebook that deserve mention here. First, it is the product of a collective undertaking in which the key authors are all telecentre network practitioners. These are highly experienced people who are presently running a telecentre network or are closely linked to them: in other words, these are people who – day in, day out – are solving problems and expanding opportunities for telecentre networks. It is a publication based entirely on on-the-ground experience.

Second, it represents an important opportunity to bring applicable knowledge from network theory to the development field; so that NGOs, aid agencies and other actors (such as individual telecentres) can start to apply it in their own operations to improve results and outcomes. This has rarely been done in the past, and it will be beneficial as we enrich and complement practice with useful theoretical aspects.

Finally, and more broadly, human development processes need to be coherent within the context of the ‘information society’, or as sociologist Manuel Castells terms it, the ‘network society’ (1998). If we are living in such a networked environment, it is essential to understand its structures, processes and power relations, so as to conduct our activities more effectively within it. Currently, emerging networked cooperation schemes are overcoming traditional North-South (one-way) cooperation flows; instead creating more South-South flows (as well as South-North ones).

=== What can i find in this guidebook? ===

This guidebook contains nine chapters, aside from the introduction, which are briefly described ahead. Chapters 2 – 8 each discuss a specific topic of interest relating to telecentre networks, while Chapters 9 and 10 provide a unifying glance at previous chapters, while suggesting ideas on moving forward.

The themes were chosen in consultation with telecentre network managers and staff. They focus on key relevant topics, providing a strong foundation (and expected guidance) to help those responsible or deeply involved with a telecentre network. More topics will be added in subsequent versions of the guidebook, particularly as it will provide the basis of a wikibook soon after its publication so that the telecentre.org community and others involved with telecentre networks can help to enrich and expand it.

Each of the seven thematic chapters are presented using the same structure; namely: (i) a descriptive section, where the main aspects of the topic in question are discussed; (ii) a case study, where some of those aspects are examined in a real life scenario; (iii) a list of quick tips, running down the key points to bear in mind about that theme; and (iv) a number of references to outstanding reports, web resources or organizations.

'''Network Governance (Chapter 2):''' Properly managing telecentre networks, as for any other organizational (or institutional) networks requires structuring and planning. Network management does not occur in a vacuum, and rarely yields good results if approached in ad-hoc or spontaneous manner. Core successful attributes and practices of TCN governance are discussed, while other aspects which could also be considered part of telecentre network governance such as participatory schemes and monitoring and evaluation, are covered in separate chapters for the sake of clarity.

'''Participatory Networks (Chapter 3):''' A fundamental pillar of telecentre network governance is participation, which should always relate to the network’s objectives. A healthy TCN should offer fertile ground for effective participation and networked collaboration. This implies the need for certain management practices, cultural factors as well as adequate tools. For instance, effective knowledge sharing depends on the level of participation and nature of the network itself.

'''Communication Strategies and Practices (Chapter 4):''' Telecentre network communication strategies should cover at least three domains. One is the wider public, which for telecentre networks often means the national level. Another refers to membership, where individual telecentres act as nodes of the network. Finally, and no less importantly, is the communication supporting the telecentres’ relationship with the communities they serve. Strategies and practices for this 3-D communication space are explained in this chapter.

'''Financial Sustainability (Chapter 5):''' One of the most recurring issues about telecentre networks is how to generate sufficient income to implement concrete activities. Various approaches to financial sustainability are discussed in this chapter, both with respect to telcentre networks as a whole, and for the ways in which TCNs can support individual telecentres to achieve sustainability. It is understood here that effective sustainability involves many dimensions beyond solely financial sustainability, including social and institutional sustainability too.

'''Content and Services for Digital Inclusion (Chapter 6):''' Telecentres are in the frontline of digital inclusion as community centers that serve people with low incomes or who cannot adequately access information and ICT-based content and services in other ways. The chapter discusses how telecentre networks can play a key role in supporting telecentres to deliver those content and services.

'''Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (Chapter 7):''' Monitoring and evaluation are important features of network governance: monitoring as a continuous process, and evaluation as time-bound intensive exercises are the main sources of institutional learning. This chapter deals with those aspects of monitoring and evaluation which telecentre network management can incorporate to know how the network is performing, and also where TCNs can strengthen the capacity of individual telecentres.

'''International Telecentre Network Collaboration (Chapter 8):''' One of the exciting new possibilities of advancing the goals and penetration of telecentres is via the collaboration of national or sub-national telecentre networks at the international level. The telecentre.org initiative is a living example, instrument and product of such collaboration. This chapter discusses tools and processes that can maximize such international collaboration via national or sub-national TCNs, with the end purpose of enabling and empowering individual telecentres.

The final two chapters focus on crosscutting telecentre network issues. '''Chapter 9''' focuses on '''Integrated Network Management''' and distils the main messages from the guidebook, aiming to pull the topics from the thematic chapters into a recognizable and cohesive picture. '''Chapter 10''' is about '''Empowering Networks''' and introduces elements of network theory and provide insights into the future of telecentres and telecentre networks, including possible lines of study and research.

There is an inevitable degree of overlap in the contents, since all these factors are interlinked and occur simultaneously in the daily operations of telecentre networks. How do you talk about participation without getting into communications issues? For the sake of clarity and brevity, efforts have been made to minimize such overlaps. We trust the reader will be understanding and patient with such occurrences.

A note about the future strategy of the guidebook: Once it has been translated into Spanish and French, it will be published in the web as a wikibook, to support its evolution into a living document as knowledge and experience about telecentre networks changes and evolves. This is based on IDRC’s philosophy on open content sharing, where the telecentre community can take the lead in enriching and expanding its contents. As such, the guidebook will grow in quality and quantity from the contributions of members of the telecentre.org community and other practitioners. Moreover, additional topics may presumably be added in the near-mid future, on topics such as (i) training for telecentre staff/volunteers, (ii) knowledge management, (iii) creation partnerships, (iv) telecentre networks and ICT policies, etc.

Enough for the introduction; let’s get into the real thing!

== Baiting and Shooting Sparrows ==

Sparrows are accustomed to feed in close flocks, and when thus assembled in favorable places a large number may be shot. The best way is to scatter grain over long, narrow areas and shoot the sparrows at these baiting places. Where sparrows infest poultry yards, the bait may be placed on a horizontal board, supported at such an elevation that the birds can be shot without danger to the poultry.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Telecentre network governance – setting the playing field for a network culture==

&lt;big&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Maria Teresa M. Camba (PhilCeCNet, Philippines)'''&lt;/center&gt; &lt;/big&gt; &lt;/big&gt;

Management challenges of telecentre networks often spring from the network formation; the decisions and actions the network leaders preferred to take. After years of network building and mentoring, we can point to a number of key aspects for successful telecentre networks. While most of these are decisions and approaches often undertaken during network formation, a telecentre network may, at any stage of its evolution, incorporate these perspectives in order to strengthen what it is already doing. This chapter examines key components of telecentre network governance such as instilling a clear vision, setting and tracking objectives, network structure, leadership, norms and accountability, resources (e.g. financial resources).

=== Dimensions of Governance for a Telecentre Network ===

Governance refers to the common norms or rules that define the actors, procedures and accepted methods for collective action. Governance may be about the whole of society (which carries a more political connotation), whereas in other instances it may refer to specific areas such as internet – therefore called internet governance. ‘Good governance’ is understood to refer to an institutional system (and a collective culture) that stimulates the efficient and responsible behaviour of a set of actors.

Through governance, networks articulate reasons for existence, targets, how to manage resources, formulate and implement policies, and how to deliver services. Strong network governance depends of good relationships amongst members, skilled people, appropriate structures as well as clear rules and practices.

The impetus and momentum for the birth of a telecentre network can spring from a variety of situations — spontaneously and informally or from a more deliberate and intended initiative. Whatever the origin, the process begins with interaction between people during which the rationale for the network starts to take shape, coalesces and solidifies until the conscious decision to form it is collectively made.

The initial stimulus that sparked and sustained this interaction provides the first indispensable element for effective network management that must be addressed.

==== A clear shared vision ====

Telecentres generally have a common vision in coming together as a network — the growth, advancement, and sustainability of their facilities as well as increased capacities to serve the needs of their immediate communities. In other cases, a network may emerge on just one of the so many issues that telecentres face. For instance, a network could be founded on the need to increase availability of local content or reliable and affordable internet connectivity.

One of the primary challenges at the early stages of telecentre network management is to define and clarify a shared vision that the membership can identify with. A clear network vision is useful when a network starts the process of identifying services, resources and partners to work with. In some cases, the network vision may change as the needs and priorities of members change or because the original problem has been addressed. A dynamic network may then choose to recreate itself over another issue. The important thing is that telecentre networks need to hold their members together through a shared vision and purpose or their members will simply slide away.

It is highly recommended that a formal statement of network purpose is made and institutionalized. This will facilitate the network’s accountability and communication with new members and partners. It will also help the network when exploring the potential for a formal structure later and the adoption of formal commitments and responsibilities towards the shared vision, in case it does not start as a formal institution.

==== Reinforcing the interaction ====

Networks require a critical level of sharing and interaction amongst members to ensure that the shared vision remains in focus for all and operational. Details of how to facilitate knowledge sharing within the network and engaging the membership are discussed in Chapters 3 (on Communication) and 4 (about Participation).

A telecentre network needs to have a communication platform through which members can interact. Most networks have discussion lists and forums for this purpose. Sharing accomplishments, issues and concerns, suggestions, and resources in a common helps a network to build and demonstrate its ‘network value’. Members get to know one another in the process, and as a result are more likely to commit to helping one another with pressing issues in the future.

==== Setting and tracking the objectives ====

The objectives of a telecentre network spring from their shared vision. Different telecentre networks, though perhaps sharing many facets of their visions, will have specific objectives that may differ. Therefore if the objectives are concrete, there are more chances to create locally relevant services.

Objectives may be classified as '''organizational''' in nature, which is, bringing telecentres under one sustaining and supportive federation to enable concerted efforts and unified representation, or strengthening the collaborative capacities of individual telecentres. They may be '''content-oriented''', seeking to establish uniformity in certain operations, standards and services provided to member telecentres, or community approaches. Then there may be '''resource-specific''' objectives, seeking the growth of the network and sustainability of members through resource mobilization and sharing, supporting human resources throughout the network or generating a pool of network resources.

A network may have one of these types of objectives as priorities or a mix of them to describe the avenues for achieving its vision. Whatever a network chooses as the parameters for achieving its vision, these have to be arrived at collectively with maximum participation of all members to ensure a corresponding degree of acceptance by all.

&lt;u&gt;It is ideal, but not mandatory, that individual telecentre objectives are aligned with network objectives&lt;/u&gt;. The participation of a telecentre in a telecentre network may be justified if even just a handful of the telecentre objectives display that alignment – as long as the other objectives do not enter into specific contradictions with what the network does or how it operates. For instance, a telecentre may wish to provide ICT training for its community (an objective) for which it will benefit as a member of the network. But if the business model of the telecentre does not allow it to share some materials (e.g. because of intellectual property considerations), it may be difficult to join a telecentre network where all members can openly share their training contents.

The other way around is a little different: &lt;u&gt;all telecentre network objectives must be based on individual telecentre objectives&lt;/u&gt; (as functions of their needs and opportunities). That is the basis on which to formulate the network’s objectives. While TCN objectives cannot be expected to pertain to all telecentre objectives, they should be defined to maximize the value to the member telecentres. In addition, part of the work of the network may be directed towards indirect objectives of some telecentres (such as when it involves policy actions that affect telecentres but do not feature among their most pressing needs).

What does this duality mean in practice? It implies that a telecentre network has to make sure it is tailored to the collective objectives of telecentres (bending over backwards if needed), while for the telecentres it is not mandatory to adapt to the network. However this does not mean that members may not need to consider certain changes in order to better participate in the network. In fact, some telecentres may well find it worthwhile to strengthen some of their capacities to better benefit from the network, whether &lt;u&gt;instrumental&lt;/u&gt; (for example, installing and utilizing Moodle to gain from e-learning opportunities available via the telecentre network), or generative (e.g. to create joint projects with other members through the network). We will discuss the latter in the last chapter, as part of advanced network management strategies.

Objectives serve as the directional signs for a network, and as we discuss in the final chapter, provide the true bearings in the network’s typically unstable navigation. Though many objectives may be defined for the mid and long term, they are never permanent fixtures. When a destination is reached, objectives should be revisited and sometimes replaced by new ones. Part of the function of telecentre network managers, as we will see in the Monitoring and Evaluation chapter, is to track the attainment of objectives and be ready to change them or identify new ones at the appropriate time.

==== Shaping the network ====
The structure a telecentre network takes largely depends on a number of factors such as size of membership, and certainly by the objectives it seeks to achieve. A network that self-identifies itself as small in terms of membership, geographical scope, or the range and reach of its objectives may not need a formal structure, in contrast to diverse and complex networks. A smaller network may use a flexible, less formal network governance approach that allows it to achieve its objectives, enables the participation and involvement of its members, as well as provides for its growth and sustainability.

An important consideration in shaping the network is the promotion of equal representation allowing proportionate participation in network decisions and operations by all members.  Whether this is achieved by shaping the structure components or by staffing the leadership and membership of these components is a decision to be made by network members.

Whatever the choice, a structure is functional and productive when it allows network membership parity in the share of authority and participation in network operations. It should thus allow leadership the means to effectively and decisively steer the organization towards its objectives while at the same time providing space for members to participate.

==== Leadership in a telecentre network ====
The issues of network management style and leadership are inevitably intertwined. While leadership inspires change, management promotes stability. Many networks start with a highly consultative process where leadership changes frequently according to issues and resources required. As the network idea solidifies, leadership may shift less often and rest within the most active and most resourced members. 

An example would be the need for a dedicated facility and staff to take on the duties of a network secretariat or hub where concerns and support services for the network are addressed at the outset. This was the case in the Philippines with the NCC-CICT (National Computer Center of the Commission on ICT) that had the reach and the resources for the Philippine Community eCenter Network (PhilCeCNet) to get itself on the launching pad, as presented in this chapter’s case study.
The organizational member who contributes the most to creating and operating such a facility usually finds itself in the leadership role at that point in time, a phase usually characterized as the transition phase before the network formally defines its structure, policies, and operations. A consensus for leadership is essential at this sensitive point. Such a consensus may be easy to arrive at when members recognize the need, and willingly allow leadership to be determined by means and capability. But in cases where similar means and capability may exist together with a certain rivalry among some members, the general interest of the network must come to the fore. In such a case, the strategy of leadership rotation by tenure may be adopted, and may be maintained as a leadership policy even in the general management of the network.
When the network matures, the management style and leadership must be rooted in the original climate that gave birth to the network – participatory and multi-sectoral. Aided by equal representation and leadership rotation, it enables the network to remain true to its essence. 

Network management, especially the day-to-day aspect of administration and support, requires that an extent of decision-making be centralized in the interest of speed, effective response, and manageability.  It would be impractical to expect that every decision the network has to make is to be derived from general deliberation. 

An effective and practical organizational structure helps this process, where a leadership component such as a representative executive council may be effective in handling decisions of a level and priority that need not be submitted to the general membership for approval.

Of course, one of the main points of decision-making refers to what kind of decisions are made, and where. A highly decentralized network that has agreed on a minimum set of rules but which uses consultation among the telecentres will in effect have a highly decentralized decision-making scheme. We will reflect on what this entails further ahead in the concluding chapter, when comparing ‘aggregating’ and ‘enabling’ network styles.

Some quick additional points to consider on network leadership:

# The network leader must see its role as facilitatory to be able to work their ideas into the network, searching for kindred spirits who want to share their pursuit.
# Networks do not require personal relationships between all members but a central issue is the coordination of the network leader. The leader or the leading organization must have good ‘chemistry’ with the members.
# It is common to have a formal agreement on the conditions of the relationship.
# Network leadership, as compared to traditional organizational leadership, tends to be more value-based than control-based. Trust becomes the central tenet to take advantage of the flexibility and agility afforded by networks.

There are several other factors that influence network management. Culture is one such factor. Some cultures are more collaborative-oriented while others may lay claim to fierce individualism. It is important to understand such external influences and appreciate how to align them harmoniously for the benefit of the network.

==== Norms and accountability ====

The mentioned strategy of leadership rotation as well as the desired balance between centralized and general decision making are examples of certain norms and defined processes a network must arrive at to achieve effective network management.

Norms cover a broad range of organizational concerns that may include:

* Membership eligibility, types, and responsibilities

* Codes of conduct

* Delineated roles and functions of network components, officers, staff, etc.

* Internal network coordination

* Monitoring and evaluation methodologies and related tasks

* Selection of officers,tenures and rules of succession

* Decision-making procedures

* Disciplinary/conflict resolution procedures

* Merit recognition

* External relations

There may be other areas where norms and processes may be developed for an effective governance system.

It is vital that norms and processes be developed after consultation with members. The diverse membership of a telecentre network requires that certain social, cultural, religious, and political sensitivities be considered carefully in the crafting of norms and procedures so as to avoid the obvious pitfalls. What may be acceptable or tolerable to one group may be offensive and insulting to another.

While the developing rules and procedures require consultation, the formalization of these rules may be the task of a special group formed for the purpose. Call it a charter, rules and guidelines, or a code of conduct: an explicit statement of these norms and processes may prove invaluable to a network's effective management.

==== Financial and other enabling resources ====
A telecentre network can determine its structure, formulate its objectives, craft a common vision and even enjoy an outstanding leadership. But it can dissipate fairly quickly if the appropriate enabling factors are not set in place. Key amongst these factors are financial resources, support human resources, technology, facilities and access to expert knowledge in areas of network concern.

The chapter on Financial Sustainability treats in some detail the challenges of ensuring necessary monetary resources and some of the means to get them. In this section we simply highlight some aspects of governance that are intimately related to financial resources.

The network start-up effort where members with the means and the most to contribute assumed temporary leadership to get things off the ground is often a curtain-raiser to the realization that once the network gets underway, that interim arrangement will cease. Telecentre network managers then have to identify resources from external sources and/or from their own members, weighting the realistic possibilities that each option presents.

The second (internal) option is directly within the control of the network and can be activated from the start. It will entail some rules regarding member financial contributions resulting in formal commitments binding on all concerned. But the first option of external resource generation will probably demand much more attention from a telecentre network manager.

Often, the chronic scarcity of resources steers a network to prioritize a culture of collective volunteerism in network management. The network is not a revenue-generating business enterprise that can support a salaried management team. But it needs to find a common basket of support sources, as the Financial Sustainability chapter discusses.

As a telecentre network matures, it often moves towards more stable management schemes: &lt;u&gt;professionalized&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;salaried&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;specialized&lt;/u&gt;. Business models will include a combination of sourcing. Institutional agreements may be reached with government entities, such as in government-led national telecentre or information society programs, covering management and operational costs of the network. Funding special projects from external sources may enable the recruitment of certain specialists or support staff to ensure success of the projects. Members may pay membership fees and a subsidy for some of the services provided by the telecentre network (e.g. technical service). Telecentre networks may offer services to outside organizations (evaluations, research, and so on) that could also help it to mobilize resources.

Finally, it should be pointed out that for many telecentre networks, especially those whose members are either struggling to generate a positive revenue stream from services to sustain operations or whose operations seem to have stalled due to resource scarcity, membership in the network may carry the hope that additional opportunities will arise to find new answers to their needs.

==== Why do some networks fail? ====
In this guidebook we are examining a plethora of factors related to managing telecentre networks that can help a network succeed. Some of them are in the realm of TCN managers – those ‘popular’ individuals are fully dedicated to the success of their networks. Many are applicable to the member telecentres.

But learning often comes from failures, and it would be wise, or simply realistic, to acknowledge that much of what is covered in the guidebook comes from the arduous road travelled by the telecentre movement worldwide and which caused many telecentres to close over the last two decades. This, together with issues inherent to networked modes of organization, can help us reflect on some of the main causes of telecentre network failure.

The following points are simply stated to make us think and to further the debate among telecentre networks:

'''Fading vision''' — When members of a network get over the first euphoric phase of networking and see that nothing much has changed and nothing new has taken place, the spirit of a network wanes and the exit of involvement and participation spells the end of a network.

'''Unequal interaction and benefits''' — some members get more out of the network than others. Some have difficulty sharing and interacting. Language problems, technology problems, resource problems, cultural and social barriers, or a combination of these may lead a number of members to conclude that the network may be suited only for a select few. Some members who are unable to establish an identity or find their place in the network may wander away and thereby weaken the network.

'''Poor leadership''' — when leadership fails to build trust and commitment, when it cannot be perceived as ethical and results-oriented, or when it fails to sustain the created culture of cooperation and sharing that is born with a network, the network withers.

Excessive control — if those tasked with coordinating or managing the network end up taking and imposing too many decisions, or if the power in the network is perceived to be too centralized or concentrated on a handful of nodes, the network will suffer in terms of shared commitment – and some members may quietly sit on the sidelines or simply step out.

'''Cliques and rivalry''' — another failure of network leadership involves the existence of dysfunctional cliques that undermine the essential spirit of the network. It worsens when leadership itself is perceived to belong to a clique. Rivalries that are allowed to flourish can sap the unity and cooperation within the organization. The sense of ‘betrayal’ that sets in is toxic for the network.

'''Resource famine''' —when a network is perceived by members as being unable to meet even the most basic of its functions due to inadequate resources it might be a good time to leave the sinking ship. If network leadership fails to show positive results for resource generation, and even the most basic network maintenance tasks falter, the network also fades away.

'''Network fatigue''' — It may occur when a members feel overwhelmed by the demands of the network (and this is a rather relative perception based on one’s own capacities) or from involvement in one network too many. When network fatigue sets in, members become silent spectators – without giving much of a clue about their relative withdrawal or inactivity. .

'''Inadequate monitoring''' — Sometimes an organization is run with little concrete information on what it is actually doing, or about how is it operating. In the case of a network, with its predominantly horizontal relationships, the absence of ‘traditional’ control by authority mechanisms make it even more important to base decisions on information and feedback. Telecentre network management should have a clear picture of what the needs of the members are (and some vision as well about the opportunities).

=== Case Study: The Philippine Community eCenter Network, Inc.[http://www.philcecnet.ph www.philcecnet.ph]===

Sometimes, there's no stopping something once the ball is rolling. When the National Computer Center of the Commission on Information and Communications Technology of the Philippines initiated a series of Knowledge Exchange Conferences (KEC), bringing together all key players, operators, and managers of 755 telecentres in the Philippines in 2005, the momentum started for what would become the Philippine Community eCenter Network or PhilCeCNet. The network idea didn't come immediately. But it arrived soon afterwards – before 2006 had even ended.

As PhilCeCNet began to take shape, it did so systematically. It drew up a charter for the network and positioned itself as an implementing partner for the Philippine CeC Program and its mandate for responsive, efficient, valuable, and sustainable Community eCenters, a role highlighted in the CeC Roadmap for 2008-2010. It also helped establish the telecentre.org Philippine Community eCenter Academy (tPCA) as the network’s capacity building arm.

With members from eight different telecentre initiatives in the Philippines, PhilCeCNet’s general assembly, the highest policy body, was organized into nine sector clusters:  National Government Agencies, Academia, NGOs, the Private Sector, Media, CeC Managers, CeC Users, Funding Agencies, and Local Government Units. Each of the sectors nominated three representatives to the Executive Council to represent each of the country's island groups – Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. The members at large then elected from among the nominees a sector representative to an Executive Council, which led by a Chairperson, implements the network’s initiatives.

Four committees corresponding to the four thrusts (or lines of work) of the national CEC program currently prepare work and implementation plans that are evaluated and approved by the Council. These Committees also draft revisions to any strategies formulated by the Executive Council and recommend options. Special committees on resource mobilization and membership development are also in place.

PhilCeCNet's administrative operations are handled by a National Secretariat. This Secretariat is led by an Executive Secretary who oversees day-to-day operations and carries out Council mandates. All CeC member concerns and affairs pass through this clearinghouse and are routed to the appropriate respondents for their information and action.

Secretariat staff keeps a close eye on PhilCeCNet's network hub website ([http://www.philcecnet.ph www.philcecnet.ph]) which is a beehive of sharing about CeCs: what they’re doing, what’s happening to them, and what’s coming up. People asking questions, others posting answers, information exchanges, and communication to network management mainly take place here. The website is a dynamic news board for all that concerns CeCs and was recently a semi-finalist for the Philippine Web Awards.  This is the hub that actualizes the interaction-sharing aspect of the network vision.

PhilCeCNet made its debut on April 3, 2008 — and it is expected to play a vital role in realizing the Philippines’ national vision of “A Community eCenter in Every Municipality” by 2010.

=== Quick tips about Network Governance ===
Network governance presents many challenges, especially when we consider that network organizations such as telecentre networks are not the same as traditional organizations in terms of structure, scope, culture or stability.

In light of what we have stated, the following tips emerge as brief reminders for telecentre network managers of priorities to keep in the back of their minds - and at the forefront of their actions!

* '''Nourish 	the vision '''	— the lifeblood and spirit of the network must always be visible, 	vibrant, and given life through progress-based results.

*'''Strengthen 	the interaction '''— 	A sustained effort to build a culture of sharing and cooperation 	within a network shows that the network is true to its intentions 	and binds members to the roots of the organization. Dynamic 	interaction also sustains one of the basic pillars of the telecentre 	network: the exchange of knowledge, skills and experience.
* '''Meet 	member needs with network objectives''' — 	When members see their own objectives reflected in the network’s 	objectives and when the advances in the network’s attainment of 	its objectives contribute to their own achievements, the commitment 	level is increased or remains high.
* ''' Organize 	well''' — 	Take time and focus closely on organizing the network well, tuning 	its structure to network objectives and member needs. This will make 	it easier to manage the network.
* '''Transparent 	and responsive communications''' — 	Good network management requires good communications between 	management and members. Being informed clearly and in a timely 	manner provides a strong sense of inclusiveness, even if the 	information communicated is bad news!
* '''Let 	leadership be true to participative management '''	—While network leadership assumes a special operational and 	administrative role, its philosophy must remain true to the original 	democratic and volunteer spirit of sharing and interaction that gave 	birth to the network.
* '''Put 	the essential systems in place '''— 	Policies, norms and processes, functions and responsibilities are 	vital to network management. They set standards, promote order, and 	prescribe the elements and codes of organizational culture.
* '''Be 	sensitive to member values''' — 	Consideration of member values in implementing network management 	shows that the network cares about its members and generates 	invaluable premiums of mutual respect and appreciation. A network 	that shows its sensitivity reflects sincerity, engenders trust and 	builds commitment.
* '''Reach 	out to partners''' — 	In sustaining the network through resources, thinking out of the box 	and discovering opportunities beyond network boundaries shows a 	network’s innovative spirit and resourcefulness. There is never a 	lack of possible partners with whom to travel the road. If the road 	leads the same way that the network is going, a fellow traveller can 	be welcome company, especially if both have something the other may 	find useful.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Communication Strategies and Practices for a Telecentre Network==

&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''''Paula Carrión (InfoDesarrollo, Ecuador)'''''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;ref&gt; InfoDesarrollo is an Ecuadorian portal that represents a good example of how external communication can be implemented within a network. It receives more than 16,000 visits per months and promotes the use of ICT in Ecuador along with other members of the Infodesarrollo network. The website is [http://www.infodesarrollo.ec www.infodesarrollo.ec].  &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Effective communication is critical to the success of telecentre networks. Without it, people who are not directly involved with network activities will never know about what’s going on, the impact activities that are having, or the value of the network itself. Communication also contributes to network growth, that is, to expand its constituency, nurture existing relationships, attract new partners and open up opportunities for new resources needed to support telecentres.

For the most part, network communications aim to achieve three things:
* '''Relationship building''' – generating participation instead of audiences by building bridges to people and organizations, and then nurturing and deepening such relationships on a regular basis.
* '''Publicrelations and awareness'''– raising or managing a positive profile of the network, its members, and important issues such as affordable connectivity for 	telecentres.
* '''Marketing 	and influence''' – promoting specific products, services and influencing behaviour change (attracting NGOs to use telecentres in their communities, for example).

In this chapter, we discuss how to create and put in place a communication strategy that can be useful for a telecentre network. It is important to distinguish between ‘internal communications’ (among telecentres within the network) and ‘external communications’ (for stakeholders and other audiences outside the network). We will also touch on the role of TCNs in strengthening communications capacities of individual telecentre members.

=== Creating a network communications strategy ===
In its simplest expression, we may consider that a telecentre network’s communication strategy has two broad dimensions: internal and external.The internal communication strategy serves to facilitate &lt;u&gt;relationship building&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;nurturing trust&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;participation&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;conflict management&lt;/u&gt; within the ‘nodes’ or network constituency. Good internal communication practices enable creation and sharing of relevant information and knowledge products as well as useful relationships. Internal network communications may also include supporting the communication needs of individual member telecentres as they reach out to respective communities. This internal aspect of communications constitutes the ‘nervous system’ of telecentre networks.

The external communications dimension deals with people and organizations outside the telecentre network. These include government, civil society, professional groups (such as educators), the private sector, and the general public. Adequate external communications create awareness about telecentre issues (including problems and possible solutions) and the impact of telecentres for national development. This awareness creates confidence among target groups in their work and relations with telecentre networks, which in turn is a key element in building and nurturing partnerships.

Successful network communications will benefit from a well thought-out strategy that has clear goals, objectives, target groups and expected outcomes that can be tracked over the time. The strategy may use specific network activities from which to draw messages to identified target groups, such as bandwidth sharing by a number of telecentres in the country to illustrate the challenges of connectivity and how networking might help.
====Elements of an effective network communications strategy ====

A good network communication strategy needs:

*      Defined '''goals and objectives''' – with specific reference to timeframe and desired outcomes
*      Identified target '''audiences''' – to tailor the tone and format of communication activities to the preferences of each audience. Networks may need to engage in some form of intelligence-building exercise to learn more about their target audiences in order to better understand them; that is, what information they may need and are most receptive to, and how they prefer to receive their information (such as text-based or face-to-face)
*      Appropriate '''tools''' and tactics – that help network reach their audiences more effectively, at a reasonable cost and with high returns. Tools may include news releases, pamphlets, brochures, electronic bulletins, newsletters, CDs, videos, radio advertising, and so on. Tactics are the venues used to disseminate the network’s messages and products such as activities and events.

A simplified communication strategy template is shown in the following text box with related questions.

&lt;div style=&quot;background-color:#E0FFFF; color:#0000FF; border: solid 1px #00a5ff; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;

&lt;center&gt;'''Box 4.1 Communication Strategy Template'''&lt;/center&gt;

'''CONTEXT:''' What is the political/social/cultural/economic environment that could influence your initiative?

'''STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:''' What trends, potential strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats are inherent in your initiative?

'''OBJECTIVES:''' What you are trying to achieve?

'''TARGET AUDIENCES:''' Whom do you need to reach to achieve your objectives?

'''MESSAGES:''' What messages must you deliver to your target audiences to achieve your objectives?

'''TOOLS AND TACTICS:''' What approaches you will take to deliver your messages to your target audiences to achieve your objectives. Include a budget

'''MONITORING/ EVALUATION:''' How is your strategy working? How did your strategy work?

&lt;/div&gt;

Generally, for network communication activities to be successful, they must deliver their message in such a way that the intended audience (i) wants to hear it (ii) needs to hear it, and (iii) expects to receive the message.

The first step towards building a network communications strategy involves a clear understanding of the purposes of the network (and thus imagining what success looks like), as well as the identification of the people and organizations the network would like to influence in order to be successful. This may have already occurred in the early stages of network creation, or perhaps it can take place through a necessary review via some kind of participatory network analysis process involving network members and partners. It is preferably done though a &lt;u&gt;face-to-fac&lt;/u&gt;e process, complemented by online communication using discussion lists or free web conferencing tools like Dimdim&lt;ref&gt;Dimdim is a free and simple web conferencing tool. It enables long-distance conferencing (using voice), and also enables people from all over the world to show what’s one their desktop, such as pictures, presentations, PDFs, general screen shots and videos. Dimdim also has a whiteboard feature that makes it easy to work online. This is a good alternative for online meetings and working face-to-face. The website is [http://www.dimdim.com www.dimdim.com]. &lt;/ref&gt;. This preparatory work should define the goal, audience and appropriate tools and tactics needed to achieve communication-based outcomes.  Including an evaluation component allows for fine-tuning as the strategy rolls out, also helping to improve future communications efforts.

Participation in shaping the strategy by the member telecentres will help build support for – and commitment to – the strategy. It will also improve the members’ capacity to manage individual communications activities, which is an added benefit to the network in the long run. 

The following set of questions might be helpful to assess communications-related aspects of the telecentre networks. It is important to elicit responses and comments that are as concrete as possible: 
* Who are the telecentre network’s members and external stakeholders and where are they located?
* What does the network need to communicate?
* What means of communication are used among members and towards external actors?
* Are these means constraining or fostering the exchange of information and contact among the parties in any way?
* What are the perceived strengths and weaknesses of the network in terms of communications?
* What and where are the main ‘information plugs’ in the telecentre networks? How can they be removed or avoided?

It is important to use the information obtained from the above questions (in addition to any other pertinent ones) to determine the network’s communications objectives, specific communications activities and expected results. It is important to determine some &lt;u&gt;simple indicators&lt;/u&gt; to track attainment of the objectives – the simpler they are the more likely telecentre network managers will use them. The following items refer to the key elements in the operational (or logic) framework, as seen in table a logic touch upon objectives, activities and results, as well as the way to track the strategy’s progress.

I think this section deserves a new title here, or at least a sentence or two describing what is about to be explained: OK, I introduced a bit of a bridge (it does follow from the paragraph, but it´s not that clear). 

'''Objectives''' – Communication is a tool, not a goal in itself. Communications objectives have to be realistic and achievable – there is no point in trying to convert a telecentre network into the telecentre equivalent of the American national news network CNN. Some examples of key communication objectives are:
* To improve communication flow with the network.
* To keep the member telecentres informed about the telecentre network activities and progress.
* To enhance interaction between local communities and their telecentres. 

'''Activities''' – These activities allow the network to accomplish its communication objectives. In designing the activities, it is useful to determine (i) '''what''' (to identify the activity itself: it can help to draw an informative chart, or start a blog, etc.); (ii) '''who''' (to identify the person or team that will execute the activity); (iii) '''when''' (to come up with a timetable for the implementation of the activity). It is also important to identify the appropriate tools required to conduct the activity, including face-to-face events (like meetings, workshops, visits), documentation (newsletters, publications, web content) and online communication (emails, discussion lists, blogs) 

'''Expected results''' – These are specific intended outcomes when activities are executed according to plan. Expected results should be achievable, measurable and traceable, for example, recognizing the frequency of a newsletter and not just its establishment. Measuring the progression of results instead of quantifying an indicator at the end of a given period makes monitoring feasible and useful.

'''Monitoring''' – An effective communications strategy requires regular updating. For this, telecentre networks need to track expected results against objectives and can ask questions such as:
* Were the intended people reached? What about other (unintended) actors?
* Did target audiences understand the messages?
* What steps can be taken to improve the outcomes?
* How can the overall communication strategy be implemented more effectively?

Even the best communications strategy will lack value if the members of the network do not share its key elements, or if they lack awareness of those elements. Holding special team meetings among a small group of people who are responsible for the execution of the strategy will help to see that it is successfully carried out. It is also recommendable that the strategy is presented and discussed as part of the agenda of a telecentre network’s specific events that involve larger groups, particularly during its preparation, and soon after implementation. The good news is that making the strategy well known will require some of the same communications tactics!

It is important to share the idea that the entire telecentre network is responsible for its communications agenda, and not just that of a few network members, or the staff of a coordinating unit. While leadership of a few individuals will have a significant effect on the attainment of communication objectives, having most people in the network connected and feeding information into it is a more likely guarantee that the network will stay well informed. In this regard, individual telecentres should view themselves as both '''antennae''' and '''broadcasters'''.

A communications strategy that yields results (which is what any network member is interested in, and not simply ‘chatter’) goes through stages in a cycle, like the one in figure 4.1. Some of the stages in the cycle are also present during a single communication action (such as producing a news bulletin, or organizing a symposium). It is important to recognize the stages, as they will require different tasks and treatment. For example, &lt;u&gt;sharing information&lt;/u&gt; can be a unilateral action, occurring quickly and using a computer. On the other hand, &lt;u&gt;negotiation&lt;/u&gt; can turn out to be a painfully slow process, requiring the participation of various actors, and using a table, tea and biscuits as the main tools. 

&lt;!-- --------    FIGURE 4.1  ------------ --&gt;

&lt;!-- --------    FIGURE ------------ --&gt;

==== External Communications====

While external communication is usually included within the overall communications strategy of a network, it is often done implicitly. External communications may seem more detached from the day-to-day life of a telecentre network, and allows less control over its implementation (where most of the actors are by definition based outside the network). They are directed to very different types of recipients: sponsors, partners, local officials, state representatives, community members and academics, and possibly other telecentre networks too.  

The tasks related to providing information to these actors and prompting their involvement are carried out differently than for internal communications. The means used can vary from actor to actor, as well as the language used. After all, the audience for external communications is generally heterogeneous, while for internal communications it is often more homogenous.

That is why the main challenge in external communications is to identify the best means to communicate to each actor. The way to communicate a message to a sponsor, in most cases, will not work with a community leader or with telecentre users. For example, a local leader may prefer oral communication to written communication – let’s remember than even today, at the start of the 21st century, some cultures are based on orality. A development agency or a newspaper will prefer written information because they can process it and save it. At the same time, establishing a relationship with a media outlet is also valuable, and that requires oral communications (phone calls, in-person visits, and so on). Thus, in our information society context, the communications strategy should be able to include a flexible repertoire of instruments: analogue and digital, written and spoken, visual and text. 

There is a wide range of communication tools available, many of which are free, to spread one’s message. For example, a distribution list such as a Dgroup&lt;ref&gt;Dgroups is another online platform that helps people meet, share information and collaborate in the international development community. It serves as a kind of GoogleGroups or YahooGroups, but specialized for development issues. Dgroups provides features such as mailing lists, a document library and calendar. The website can be found at [http://dgroups.org dgroups.org]. &lt;/ref&gt; can be easily created which facilitates ongoing dialogue among stakeholders; including beneficiaries, sponsors, partners and the community. Not only do distribution lists bring multiple voices to the network, but they also help telecentre network members to provide feedback to the network.  On the other hand, a periodic (weekly or monthly) e-bulletin is an efficient means to inform external parties about TCN activities, needs and outcomes. For real-time information dissemination, an RSS (real simple syndication) or Atom newsfeed may be a good idea.

In addition, other web 2.0 tools such as blogs, Twitter, social network tools (such as MySpace, Orkut, Facebook, and ning) allow for a multimedia mix of information to be offered, including pictures and video clips. This provides enormous opportunities. For example, wouldn’t a partner/funder like to see short clips on how its supported telecentre network is working with local teachers to enrich their classrooms with fresh, new content? How valuable is it for a local television station to access content about teenagers from conflictive parts of town who are stimulated to ‘create’ (e.g. videos with their stories, websites, etc.) rather than ‘destroy’? 

Choosing a language for communication is very important. When communicating with a sponsor, it is generally a good idea to use more formal language and articulate the results and processes advanced through the telecentre network. When communicating with local partners, on the other hand, it can be useful to adapt a style more closely based on how they communicate.

Candidly sharing lessons learned with sponsors is a way to generate trust with that sponsor, such as why an activity failed, and how learning from that failure will help the network grow. It will also help to sustain a longer-term relationship, as sponsors (particularly development agencies) are aware that all projects find difficulties. Sometimes the outstanding feature about a project is how it went about overcoming its difficulties. 

Finally, one can take advantage of electronic and print media as key infomediaries to the outside community&lt;ref&gt;An infomediary is an entity that functions as an intermediary of information (instead of goods or services).&lt;/ref&gt;. These institutions can help to deliver important messages, engaging new audiences and potential partners. Media organizations are constantly in search of interesting stories that affect human development. Telecentre networks are working with telecentres whose business is to improve people’s lives. TCNs can attract and maintain good contacts in the media using press releases, regular short stories, video clips, etc. about how telecentres are making a difference and providing useful solutions to public interest issues. Local media outlets want to access ‘human stories’, and pre-packaged news bits, with data, quotes, pictures, etc. It is also wise to have network spokespeople available and to provide these spokespeople with key messages to which they can refer should they be contacted by media.

====What about communications for member telecentres? ====

The communications strategies and practices of a telecentre network should also include ways of supporting member telecentres with their own communications needs. Ultimately, as in other aspects of the telecentre network, it is the work of the individual telecentres that determines its success or failure. Telecentre staff seldom has the expertise or time to put together a well thought-out communications plan.

This is one of the aspects where being part of a telecentre network may really pay off. Telecentre workers understand the needs of the local population and their cultural norms, and TCN staff can help workers to build capacity through the following:

*      Devising and putting into action a community outreach plan, in effect ‘taking the telecentre outside its walls and into the streets’. This can include visits to schools, civic organizations, business centers, marketplaces, etc.
*      Producing content (such as video clips) that can help telecentre staff to better connect with the community.
*      Using ICT tools to help them communicate with their communities and stakeholders.
*      Generating and extending the TCN ‘brand’ to the individual telecentres, for greater visibility and publicity (and by providing templates, key messages, logos and other materials to help facilitate this).

Telecentre network staff can also help directly organize and implement various communication-related activities, such as:

*      Moderating discussion lists where telecentre staff share and debate about communications with their users.
*      Generating content that can easily be adapted to local telecentre needs to contact and engage local citizens, such as poster templates, interview scripts, surveys, etc.
*      Creating network-wide activities that promote local participation, such as contests, scholarships, or art displays.

=== Case study – the E3 Project in Sri Lanka &lt;ref&gt;This case study has been provided by Niranjan Meegammana, Shilpa Sayura Foundation Sri Lanka
&lt;/ref&gt;===

The E3 project started in June 2008 to enhance the sustainability of 60 telecentres in Sri Lanka’s Uva province. It was prompted by a monitoring and evaluation process carried out by the national Information and Communications Technology Agency (ICTA), which found that the lack of communication was one of the key issues challenging the sustainability of the Uva Telecentre Network.

Part of the project [http://www.shilpasayura.org www.shilpasayura.org] involved the creation of a network communications platform developed by a national organization, the E–fusion Regional Impact Team (RIT), with tools used for training and content sharing, connecting key stakeholders as shown in the image found below (Figure 4.2). It also facilitated monitoring tasks for the network. The platform is depicted in the graph below.

&lt;!-- ----------      Figure 4.2     -------------       --&gt;

[[File:Figure 4.2 E3 Telecentre Network Communications Platform.png|thumb|400px|center|Figure 4.2 E3 Telecentre Network Communications Platform]]

&lt;!-- ----------      Figure 4.2     -------------       --&gt;

A significant challenge was to establish a communications platform where only slightly over half (52%) of the 60 telecentres had internet access. There were also different levels of language and ICT skills within the network.

'''''Methods'''''

The E–fusion Regional Impact Team assessed telecentre needs by conducting small workshops, telecentre visits, and questionnaires to help design the communcations strategy. The network communication platform provided messaging services among RIT, telecentres, ICTA and service providers.

'''''Network communication strategies'''''

Transparency and open group communications helped to develop trust among members. The creation of a ‘network think-tank’ increased stakeholder involvement. Connecting members of the telecentre community with government and business helped to increase network reach. Telecentre operators were empowered to represent their centres which increasing local ownership. Periodic monitoring reports helped resolve network issues. All communications were carried out with authenticated identity. Forming a Telecentre Community Association created a front end to represent the network.

'''''Content, tools and channels'''''

Using online tools and e-content in ‘local language’ increased participation and reach. The communication media used were email, blogs, fora, discussion lists, ning social networks, telephone, Skype web-conferencing, chat and SMS messaging to communicate effectively within the network to share and transfer telecentre knowledge. Regular workshops helped to improve inter-telecentre communications, knowledge networking and resources sharing.

'''''Feedback'''''

Forums, surveys, activity photos, videos, blogging and comments captured feedback to improve the process.

'''''Outcomes'''''

Before the E3 project, each of the Uva telecentres were isolated, individual competing entities. The nine-month duration of the first phase of the project improved network communications to make telecentres truly emerge as a telecentre network. The E3 network communication strategy assisted in the effective delivery of telecentre support services, content, capacity building, advocacy, research and reporting. Advocacy actions motivated the emergence of a Telecentre Sustainability Network (TSN), receiving national and global ICT4D research attention for telecentre sustainability development.

'''''Lessons learned'''''

The diversity within Uva telecentres was a challenge for network communications to bring loosely bound individual telecentres into a network. Creating some &lt;u&gt;early benefits&lt;/u&gt; helped, such as deploying an e-learning platform to set off joint activities among telecentres.

There were, however, some problems along the way. Some telecentres, even if individually successful, did not contribute enough to the network with their skills and resources. Lack of a gender perspective (as revealed through women’s reluctance to engage in network-wide activities) also affected network communications. Negotiation and awareness improved the situation, but some individuals’ positions did not move much over time.

Effective network communications require openness, use of local languages and effective tools. In a loosely bound network misunderstandings can always occur; hence network messages require careful consideration of content and channels of delivery. For example, if a message with information of general interest is not received by all telecentre, it can negatively affect the entire telecentre network. Therefore, making &lt;u&gt;feedback mechanisms available and having&lt;/u&gt; processes for &lt;u&gt;corrective action&lt;/u&gt; are a must.

&lt;u&gt;Postal mail&lt;/u&gt;, even if not considered ‘modern’, can be an effective network messaging element to involve non-ICT literate stakeholders (and amazingly enough, some telecentre owners may fit in this category).

&lt;u&gt;Open communications&lt;/u&gt; help to motivate &lt;u&gt;small players to play big roles&lt;/u&gt; in the network and &lt;u&gt;informal communications&lt;/u&gt;are useful in &lt;u&gt;assessing the effectiveness &lt;/u&gt;of network programs.

=== Quick Tips about Communications Strategies and Practice in Telecentre Networks ===
====Internal Communications ====
* A healthy communication flow among the members is the energy that keeps a network active and feeds the solidarity and confidence required for the TCN to be successful. 
* Nothing replaces face-to-face communication; plan for annual meetings. 
* Make sure that the network objectives are well known, and at least generally accepted by the members.
* Use web 2.0 tools, which simplify making contributions and producing content.
* Foster confidence and trust between your users. You won’t openly share things if you do not trust the person you are working with.
* In order to create incentive for communication among network members, it is important to name one or two facilitators that can help you encourage participation.
* Promote discussion fora that will help to keep the network active.
* One of the best incentives is to help individual telecentres better communicate themselves: make this a central part of your communications strategy. 
* In case you do not have the level of participation you were expecting, get help! Some individuals in the network may be able to assist you in motivating other members. And even better, revise stimuli to communicate for the members.

====External Communications ====
* Focus 	on your target audience and the main ideas you want to communicate.
* Try 	to personalize messages according to your audience and the goal you 	want to achieve.
* The 	message has to be concrete and clear; remember that ‘less is often 	more’ in public communications
* Your 	message structure always should have an introduction, message body 	and conclusion.
* Make 	sure that your audience has a way to contact the telecentre, and 	provide a formal, institutional email address (i.e. 	[mailto:star-telecentre@telecentre.org star-telecentre@telecentre.org]), 	a postal address, and a phone number. Most importantly, respond to 	those contacts timely (within 48 hours if possible).
* Create 	a blog for your telecentre network. It will make it easier to keep 	your partners and possible donors informed about the activities of 	the telecentres and their communities.
* In 	a visible place in the telecentre, prepare a poster with all the 	information regarding the telecentre, its rules, schedule, etc.
* Keep 	the community informed about telecentre activities and how it is 	accomplishing its goals. Also let the community know if you need 	some help.
* Quality 	over quantity: how you communicate is more important than how much 	you communicate.
* Think 	and communicate positively but credibly: in the case of 	failures 	(which are normal experiences and occur regularly) try to emphasize 	the lessons learned.
* Get 	the most out of the Web 2.0. Use social networks, blogs, tags, 	YouTube, web picture albums, etc. to let the world know about your 	TCN and its telecentres.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''''Olga P. Paz Martínez (COLNODO, Colombia)'''''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Networks are sources of social and organizational support where interactions, exchanges and relations between different actors take place. Partnership networks enable the realization of individual goals which otherwise could not be reached as an individual person or organization. This is precisely why we integrate telecentres into networks.

Establishing interactive networks is not an easy task, due to the many factors that come into play. We have to structure a network, set goals and long-term plans as equitably as possible, which is always a challenge because it involves fulfilling the demands and requests from various members.

When several members decide to join a network, it is because they find value in the benefits, but at the same time they assume shared responsibility and take charge in making it stronger. We have to understand that participation is not an engine that generates profits for its network nodes/members; rather, &lt;u&gt;the participatory dynamic is itself the main potential benefit&lt;/u&gt;, where the social capital for these organizations increases as a result.

This is why the management of a telecentre network should include an outline or plan of participation to promote collaboration among each telecentre member through flexibility, freedom and incentives. Bear in mind that a high level of participation will significantly promote sustainability of the network.

We hope that this chapter will help you to discover ways of increasing the levels of participation within your telecentre network. First, we discuss the motivation of members to participate in a telecentre network and how to get these members involved or committed once they are in. We will talk about some aspects of network governance directly related to promote participation (linked with the previous chapter about telecentre network governance). Next, we will explore the issue of a distributed leadership and the principles of a collaborative culture, after which we will identify different factors and methodological tools that can help to make participation more effective. Finally, we will discuss a key issue for telecentre networks that directly depends on their collaborative culture: knowledge management.

=== Participation as an Engine of Telecentre Networks ===
==== Commitment and motivation to create a telecentre network====

Participation is at the core of telecentre networks. Almost by definition, a network results from the following participation exercise: several individuals and organizations come together and decide on the principles, objectives and structure of the network. But before creating a network, they identify several common motivations; some in their own interest, and others for the benefit of everyone, such as: 

* To build and strengthen political positions for specific actors or situations;
* To create initiatives and joint projects between several telecentres based on a common goal and for the benefit of members;
* To share content, courses, knowledge, etc.;
* To face situations and risks that would be significantly more difficult to handle individually.

These fundamentals of participation and collaboration may be obvious enough for founding members, or at least implicitly felt. But as new nodes or members join the network, the participation base can become diffused or unclear. Therefore, it is very important to communicate to new members the importance of the participation and collaboration principles so that they can fully share the principles, objectives, policies and ways of acting inside the network. It will also help to &lt;u&gt;document&lt;/u&gt; the participation and collaboration activities, in order to maintain these goals.

==== Involving members in the network ====

When you start the process of setting up a network, one of the first issues is the process of membership. It is important to have a formal procedure that involves the communication of a request from the member interested in being part of the network. This document has to indicate that the member agrees and fully shares the principles of the network, including in the participatory and collaborative aspects.

Although it is generally assumed that if new members choose to join a network it is because they agree with the principles, some may want to join only because they want the prestige of belonging to the network (especially if it is widely recognized), so they may not have a full understanding of the participation and collaborative aspects.

In this sense, it is worth running an introduction or training session for new telecentres members. This can be done as a talk, a meeting, a workshop or an interactive online workshop where the member telecentre can have the opportunity to ask questions and propose activities to be developed. Also, it would be good to consider doing the introduction or training before formally accepting new members in the telecentre network, so that introduction is part of the procedure of joining the network.

If the new telecentres can understand and share in the principles, values and goals of the network, it is easier to generate good ideas, proactive attitudes and new lines of collaborative work. On the other hand, if new members do not share in the ideas, values, principals and goals of the network, it will be harder to reach agreement and take constructive actions that ensure compliance with the network’s goals. We may actually jeopardize the stability of a network if new members cause a disturbance or are difficult to negotiate with.

==== Participation and governance ====

 
As the network grows, one of the most important issues that helps to ensure the future of the network is in the way that it is managed. The nature of a network as an organizational structure implies that a network is not meant to be lead, it is meant to be coordinated.

The governance of a telecentre network (as mentioned in the previous chapter) is largely characterized by coordination. Whether as individual or a collective coordination, this implies – almost by definition – that members of the network will work together for the benefit of the network as a whole group.

Therefore, active participation is one of the main indicators of good governance of the telecentre network. The management team of the network must pay special attention to issues related to coordination and governance, such as:

* To undertake the action plan of the network during a specific time period that is defined by members, in order to facilitate their commitment and interest in planning;
* To manage and share with new members the network values and principles so they all know how to participate in the network, as previously noted. 
* To design, develop and implement training on how to participate and collaborate on networking activities. 
* To collectively determine monitoring and evaluation methodologies for the network.
* To include the telecentre in taking on monitoring tasks, maintaining an open and participatory point of view. 
* To encourage member telecentres to promote their visibility through external communications, on topics such as news, projects, event announcements, calls for publications and so on, so that people outside the network stay informed.

In practice, people involved with telecentre networks know that coordination involves a delicate balance between centralization and decentralization. But to maintain coordination does not necessarily imply that decision-making processes are centralized, or that the actions are carried out without the support of members. Put simply, it is important to ensure there is a person or team in place that takes responsibility for general network tasks. If there is a lack of coordination, there is a risk that the responsibility becomes dispersed and therefore that no one takes care of tasks.

To coordinate without centralization means maintaining a healthy balance between taking action and delegating responsibilities, while including the members of the network. This is not an easy balance to achieve, and needs to be negotiated between several aspects:

* The coordination involves making decisions and the delegation of duties that must be synchronized with the network principles and objectives. There should be a margin of discretion for those making decisions.
* Members often (wrongly) believe that if there is a person or group in charge of coordination, that that specific person or group has to take care of all networks tasks.
* Being proactive and collectively making decisions as a team implies a high investment of time and resources, and members are not always available to meet such requirements.
* The leadership style of the coordinating team should be one that is inclusive, participatory and well oriented. This coordination must be carried out by a network leader who is open to constructive dialogue.

==== Participatory Leadership ====

To ensure that members feel like part of a telecentre network, it is important to avoid any hierarchical planning which works against the horizontal nature of a network, since that is one of the most positive attributes of a network. A network consists of nodes that normally interact with one other with a margin of freedom and autonomy. In this sense, the network is a space where ideas are freely exchanged, relationships are maintained and information and knowledge circulates between the telecentres (and other non-telecentre members who may also be part of the network). 

We want to promote collaborative activities and operationalize the desired horizontality of our telecentre networks. But to 'impose' or ‘demand’ participation is not an effective way to encourage collaboration; rather, networks should work towards creating a collaborative culture, which can be done by supporting a participatory style of leadership, rather than one that is ‘top-down’.

Participatory (or distributed) leadership implies 'harmonious leadership', based on common values. It may not be the kind of leadership style that most of us are used to, but there are ways to promote it within telecentre networks. Participatory leadership does not imply sharing leadership responsibilities between network members, nor does it mean that members each have a particular level of leadership to live up to. What is actually implies is described by the following:

* Various actors in a network can exhibit leadership in parallel, which corresponds to their shared interests and objectives;
* Taking care that leadership does not become 'obligatory' or 'decreed' for any person or entity; and that
* Actively building leadership skills among members of the network is critical.

For starters, it is advantageous that telecentre networks are open systems that are continually bringing on new members, while existing members always have the option of leaving the network. Individual roles can change (where formal management tasks may shift from one telecentre to another), as well as leaders, who may change or move around between telecentres.

In the majority of telecentre networks, there exists some kind of entity that governs the network, such as a Coordinating Committee, or an Executive Secretariat, and so on. This entity depends on the effective functioning of the network, and actually makes the coordination easier, especially when the focus is on facilitation  (i.e. actions) rather than on concentration (i.e. power). 

On the other hand, participatory leadership is useful when the network wants to bring forth a particular action (since the network does not always represent one single actor), or when negotiating actions that encourage the active participation of various members (where certain leadership responsibilities can even be delegated). 

In any case, we should avoid comparing leadership and management styles, and neither should it be assumed that people or entities with more leadership skills will automatically take on management or administration duties. Leadership and management styles will vary depending on the characteristics of the telecentre network.

Participatory leadership can also help to resolve conflicts and provide solutions in difficult situations. A network of telecentres can have a remarkably heterogeneous composition, with nodes and members that coexist rather than compete, whereas with others there may be competition and power struggles. A highly centralized leadership can sometimes effectively resolve differences between members. That said, for the sustainable and healthy growth of a telecentre network, it is important that the governance of network take on a participatory leadership style, where many problems can be solved collegially.

==== Collaborative culture ====

To establish a collaborative culture is one of the most difficult – but also critical – points in creating a productive telecentre network. It is difficult (and quite likely impossible) to develop participatory leadership within an environment that does not embrace a culture of collaboration. That is, this type of leadership can help to promote collaboration, but it is virtually impossible to be the sole cause behind the creation of a collaborative culture. On the one hand, it can help to delegate work and distribute activities among members. On the other hand, the first step towards creating the initiative for collaborative working must come directly from members themselves.

The value of a network greatly increases when there is a real culture of collaboration among member telecentres. The more spontaneous the collaborative activities (as a result of the tools, methods and even the possibility of access to funding), the easier it will be to launch joint projects whose results can actually feed into each other and increase mutual trust. This may be an area where a collaborative culture of networks can play a bigger role: in the end, organizations with a highly rigid structure can also work in a decentralized manner (like an army, for example). Networks can create an ecosystem of collaborative working characterized by the freedom, merit and shared visions that often lead to very interesting results – in the area open source software, for example.

A network of telecentres that enjoys a healthy collaborative culture will be a productive one, and most likely sustainable as well. But like distributed leadership, a collaborative culture also requires types of participation that do not negatively impact the efficiency or results of the network.

==== Effective participation====

It is not possible (nor recommendable) to achieve 100% participation while including all network nodes and members in the decision making process of a network, and even less with respect to specific network-related projects and activities. Participation for the sake of participation alone can risk becoming an aimless process, like a book without words. What we need is a well-designed model of participation, one that is results-oriented, designed to achieve the desired outcomes. For example, the level of participation necessary for the strategic planning of a network of telecentres is not the same as would be needed for the redesign of the network website.

A well-functioning network is not one that maximizes participation quantitatively (measuring the number of participants), but rather one that qualitatively maximizes the products/results achieved in a participatory manner. A network usually distributes its work along particular lines of action, while some members tend to be more committed to the development strategies than others because it is within their particular interest to do so. For example, some telecentres are more able to participate than others in activities such as research, or in the generation of content rather than in the provision of services.

It is therefore important to strengthen and stimulate people’s networking ability, with the so-called 'generative capacity' to which we referred in the previous chapter and which we will also describe in the last chapter. An important function of a TCN is the capacity for building leadership, planning, collaboration, and negotiation skills from &lt;u&gt;a network point of view&lt;/u&gt;. In other words, to be able to perform all those network functions within a network environment (for the purposes of our own network and more broadly for the ‘network society’).

In addition to training, another way to generate those capabilities is simply through practice, such as by managing a project or organization that requires coordination and working in a network. Coordinating a network involves a lot of difficult negotiation, like the daily work of a spider that weaves its web and tries to keep it from breaking.

It is critical for the people who take on coordination of the network to promote effective participation, in a way that does not wear out the participants and which generates results effectively and efficiently. One way to achieve this is through the continual identification of opportunities for collaboration through projects, activities, campaigns, and so on.

Additionally, network coordinators tend to be very familiar with each of the network members, and can therefore steer the most appropriate opportunities towards the individual nodes (telecentres) best suited for the work.

==== Knowledge Management ====

Knowledge is one of the main assets of a telecentre network. It can be either tacit or explicit, but in any case it is conditional to the uses and social and cultural history background of each person, organization or community. Tacit knowledge is based on individual experience, skills, abilities, values, judgments, beliefs, viewpoints and mental maps of each person, and therefore is not easy to share with others, at least not in a systematic way. 

Explicit knowledge is that which can be expressed in words, a song, numbers, charts, formulas, and so on. It is a kind of knowledge we can find in different learning tools such as videos, books, articles, websites, and we can access in different places such as libraries, hard disk drives, databases, museums or newspapers. The application and use of this type of knowledge is one of the biggest attractions to becoming part of a network. To make the most use of it, it is recommendable to have a knowledge management strategy plan, especially one that can be documented.

Knowledge management (KM) refers to different processes that seek to transform, generate and transfer knowledge. One of KM’s main challenges is to capture tacit knowledge in order to share it with other people, sometimes becoming explicit knowledge in the process. A good strategy takes both tacit and explicit knowledge into account, each involving the most appropriate tools and mechanisms. In this way, the strategy will draw on the most appropriate people, organizations (i.e. telecentres in this case) or telecentre network to involve.
 
The concept of knowledge management goes beyond knowledge transfer alone, and therefore the concept of ‘participation’ is also addressed in this chapter. Participation is the core principle for network growth. It’s more like a kind of ‘know-how’, a social discursive knowledge that shifts through media and products of knowledge. The knowledge within each node can be expressed in many different ways in the telecentre network, such as through workshops, meetings, books, websites, videos, etc.

A good knowledge management strategy is that it is ‘open’ rather than imposed, and it should be based on the respect for the knowledge of others. Knowledge can be shared in the form of lessons learned, experiences, or best practices and it should always be used to contribute to, and complement, existing knowledge and practices in telecentres – not to replace them.

Knowledge management should consider both live and virtual presence, by taking advantage of ICTs to facilitate collaboration and participation, including:

* Virtual communities (such as ning used by telecentre.org, or Dgroups);
* Social networks (including Facebook, Sonico, Tuenti, etc.);
* Places to share content (flickr, YouTube, Slideshare, GoogleMaps, etc.);
* Collaborative editing documents, such as a wiki or googledoc; or 
* Virtual training courses.

A knowledge management workplan can specify the tools and communication media to use to share information, as well as frequency of use, structure, design, content production, editorial policies or a style manual. 

But the ease of access to these tools should not cause a sea of information and content that can overwhelm members. Just like effective participation, knowledge management must incorporate effective methods for the input/output of specific knowledge available to members: when and where they need it. However, this is without a doubt much easier to say than do; in many jobs, information overload impacts productivity and stress levels.

In order to avoid such problems, and to effectively take on knowledge management within a community or group, it is useful to identify one or more facilitators who can facilitate knowledge flows. Knowledge management is more an art than science, and it benefits from people in the community who know how to motivate others and who can find the correct channels to spread useful information to the right people. Very few knowledge networks can claim success without the constant and dedicated work of these ‘infomediaries’.

It is possible for knowledge to be efficiently managed without using participatory processes; this is something that happens every day in centralized organizations. In networks, however, participation is essential to ensure knowledge flows that do not depend on instructions from above, but rather on collaborative participation where each member adds value to the network. 

In summary, the value of a network is a function of the possibility of creating shared knowledge through the experience base of each of the actors.

=== Case Study – The National Telecentre Network in Colombia ===

The National Telecentre Network in Colombia has been informally functioning as a network since mid-2001, with participation from the civil society, business and government sectors. 

The aim of the network is to “create an efficient and sustainable model of collaboration between members, with the aim of creating a positive impact on the development dynamics in the communities”&lt;ref&gt;From the National Network of Telecentres Action Plan document 2009 &lt;/ref&gt;. In other words, the network focuses specifically on participatory and collaborative processes. 

The strategic objectives of the network are:

* To strengthen ICT community access centres;
* To promote information and knowledge exchange (experiences, lessons learned, ideas, resources, teaching materials, methodologies, tools, etc.) between network members and other communication networks, public media and social movements;
* To promote the consolidation of the national telecentre.org Academy;
* To promote the development of virtual communities, including both thematic and regional;
* To encourage the participation of network members in various fora for discussion and learning about ICT and Development, at both the national and international levels. 
* To promote the development of regional networks of telecentres (at state, municipal, and local levels).

The network brings together the people and organizations who coordinate, research, lead, train and assist in national telecentre processes. It aims to open spaces for dialogue between telecentre initiatives that are led by various players, helping to connect telecentres put in place by the national government (through the Compartel program), and those by local governments, private companies, universities, NGOs, research centers, or community organizations.

Currently, the network is coordinated by a Coordinating Committee, which is composed of the following organizations:

* Colnodo ([http://www.colnodo.apc.org www.colnodo.apc.org])
* Makaia Corporation ([http://www.makaia.org www.makaia.org])
* Universidad Autónoma de Occidente, UAO ([http://www.uao.edu.co www.uao.edu.co]) 
* University of Cauca ([http://www.unicauca.edu.co www.unicauca.edu.co]) 
* Ministry of Communications of Colombia ([http://www.mincomunicaciones.gov.co www.mincomunicaciones.gov.co]) and the Compartel Program ([http://www.compartel.gov.co www.compartel.gov.co]); and 
* Digital Corporation of Colombia ([http://www.colombiadigital.net www.colombiadigital.net])

Telecentres in Colombia vary according to their financial structure, how they are installed, overall operation and location. However, they all share in their aim to achieve social and financial sustainability and the meeting of local needs in order to positively impact on the community, to achieve development goals.

The network has run '''National Telecentre Meetings''', which have been financed, coordinated and convened by civil society organizations with help and support of national and local governments. 

Up until now they have held five meetings. The objectives of the meetings have varied between exchanging experiences to building collaborative strategies and consolidating the network. Although the first meetings were intended to bring everyone together, share experiences and identify lessons learned, and common needs and challenges, they have evolved into active learning spaces through live workshops, discussion forums about public access to ICTs, and debate about a common agenda to strengthen the network.

The main impact of the network is reflected in these meetings and on the fact that they have gathered hundreds of telecentre managers together from different areas of the country. The meetings maintain their purpose as regular spaces for discussion and sharing experiences, learning, training telecentre leaders and creating partnerships.

The conference has grown from 30 participants in the first meeting to over 80 in the second and third, reaching 110 participants in the fourth and 200 in the fifth and latest meeting. The meetings were intentionally focused on being participatory spaces for exchange and discussion rather than academic spaces, particularly to promote the participation of those directly involved in the day-to-day running of telecentres. In the fourth meeting it was possible for the first time to include the participation of Compartel telecentres managers, a new government initiative that has put in place about 1,700 telecentres throughout the country. 

Each meeting saw an increase in regional participation. Colombia is divided into 32 districts, and by the fifth meeting they managed to include telecentre leaders and managers from 20 districts, which represents a significant portion of the whole country.

Other important areas of the Colombian national network’s emphasis on participation are:

'''Knowledge Management:''' To facilitate access and improve communication within the network, the following activities are encouraged:
 
* The creation of virtual communities for knowledge sharing and dialogue;
* The exchange of teaching materials, methodologies and tools on various issues that may impact the telecentre development;
* The participation of network members in various scenarios of discussion and learning about ICTs and development;
* The reflection and discussion of new proposals for community communication, new technologies for virtual interactive meetings, at the regional and national levels.

'''Information and Communication:''' The goal is to build a communication strategy that strengthens network information channels by promoting interaction and dialogue among members. The main network spaces for information and virtual communication on the internet are:

* The national telecentre portal: [http://www.telecentros.org.co www.telecentros.org.co]
* The network distribution list: [mailto:colombia@tele-centros.org colombia@tele-centros.org]
* The telecentre network virtual community: [http://comunidad.telecentros.org.co comunidad.telecentros.org.co]

'''Education &amp; Training:''' The network strengthens the skills and abilities of people who manage telecentres through a process of in-class and virtual training. The first virtual training project is the national '''telecentre.org Academy'''. For in-class training, local and national telecentre meetings are held.

Each of these lines of work is undertaken in a collaborative way. While the leadership for each of these processes lies in the hands of a member organization (according to its individual mission), attempts are made to include members from different parts of country in their implementation. 

In order to undertake more network-related activities, more information about the network was gathered, including the total number of telecentres in Colombia, their associated characteristics, and where they are located. Further, it is hoped that in the future:

* Hundreds of telecentre managers and leaders will formally confirm their participation in the network;
* The telecentres will be mapped geographically (available online);
* Effective channels of information and communication between members to publish information through the virtual community;
* An online library of materials and resources will be created;
* There will be a continued production of free tools that all telecentres in Colombia can use, in order to improve their skills and performance;
* A user registration system will be created.

Through the participation of our members we have achieved the following things as a network:

* The consolidation of the national telecentre.org Academy, where more than 350 telecentre managers and leaders have been certified via virtual training courses.
* The organization of five national and regional telecentre meetings, which have been attended by more than 400 people in total who are all associated with the telecentre movement in Colombia (particularly telecentre managers and leaders);
* The creation of information and communication media for the network, such as the portal that includes the experiences, materials, resources and virtual community for more than 40 telecentres with more than 350 people registered.
* The mapping of 864 telecentres, of which 131 are online and the rest are near to completion.
* Influence on ICT policy in Colombia. One example refers to the implementation model for 1669 new Compartel telecentres operating from within educational institutions and which will use a methodology for social telecentre appropriation designed, tested and published by the network;
* The recognition of the network as a leader in telecentre issues in Colombia. In fact, when completed, the new Compartel telecentres will be joining the national network.

One of the most important &lt;u&gt;lessons learned&lt;/u&gt; is that the network will not function without an organizing agency to guide it and lead activities in collaboration with other members. Despite the initial successes, particularly with respect to the national meetings, it through the managing committee that many beneficial activities were brought about for telecentres in Colombia, also incorporating decision-makers at the local and national levels. 

However, it is nevertheless a challenge for the managing committee to become much more involved in telecentre work, not just as beneficiaries but also as executives. For collaboration between members to really be strengthened, communication channels need to be relied upon, including virtually, as well as through face-to-face exchanges such as workshops, meetings and forums.

=== Quick tips about participation in telecentre networks ===

* A collaborative spirit and constant support from those members who wish for a network of telecentres should be pursued deliberately – it does not usually happen by itself.
* Most decisions in networks must be come about through consensus, in order to enhance the process of negotiation and compromise.
* Trust among members and transparency of actions are some of the core requirements for participation to take place.
* Training on networking activities helps to improve teamwork and productivity and therefore encourages participation.
* Collaborative cultures are not achieved in the short term, but must be gradually advanced and taken into consideration in the medium-term.
* One should always ask ‘what can I do for the network?’ over ‘what can the network do for me?’
* Proactive collaboration between network members contributes significantly to the sustainability of the network.
* It is essential to prevent competition between members, nodes, projects, or events in the network. The role of the network is to encourage complementarity, not competition.
* It is necessary to strengthen channels of communication and information and to have a fluid flow of ongoing communication with members.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Manuel Acevedo Ruiz'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

In the previous chapter we explored the integrated nature of telecentre network management, taking into account the interaction of its various aspects. We also pointed out the significant and aggregated impact of network effects when those management aspects relate productively to one another. However, an important issue remains to be considered: how can we improve ways of working so that we can fully exploit the networking potential of TCNs?
This chapter contemplates the road ahead in telecentre network management. And since this is a living document that will change via a wiki, this section will likely change accordingly. After all, the view of a road depends on where you are in it. 

The question posed in the first paragraph implies that there are gaps in collaborative methodologies in network environments, and arguably this is often the case. Sometimes an entity that describes itself as a network actually follows traditional, linear practices. Or it has strict, hierarchical strings of power and control. In other words, it calls itself a network, but it does not truly act as one. 

Let’s take, as a hypothetical example, a telecentre network that is undertaking a project to extend educational content about the country’s history from local stories and traditions. Through observation it is determined that (i) only a small percentage of the telecentres actually gets involved, (ii) each participating telecentre provides content in whatever format it wants and (iii) there are no means through which to determine the assessment of the membership about specific submissions. The end result is nevertheless a reasonable repository of historical local content. 

In spite of having carried out an activity resembling network practices, the project will lack the power of the network to (i) include a wide participation from its telecentres (so that perhaps some of the best stories are missing); (ii) determine a proper way to prepare the content, so that stories and traditions are not presented in comparable formats and make it hard to process the entries; and (iii) include the opinions and judgements of the involved telecentres on the selected content. The final product will be less representative, have less quality, have demanded more work to produce and will have a lower educational value than could have been attained through a proper networked process. 

In this concluding chapter we discuss network strategies that can help us get the most out of telecentre networks and examine some of the key challenges ahead in the short and mid term, such as:

* What strategies can help us to better collaborate (and more productively so) in telecentre networks?
* What kind of networks can best empower member telecentres, individually as well as collectively? and;
* What measures and policies could help the telecentre movement to advance towards a stable, firmly-rooted and networked future?’

Finally, let us mention that collaborative networking initiatives are not restricted to the social or development arena. It is increasingly reaching into the business and corporate environments as well. As Tapscott &amp; Williams (2008) observe in the preface to their popular ‘Wikinomics’ book, ''“Thanks to Web 2.0, companies are beginning to conceive, design, develop and distribute products and services in profoundly new ways”'' (p. ix), and there are many examples of how companies are embracing this collaborative, networked style of working, from small upstarts to established giants such as IBM or Procter and Gamble. 

=== Formulating a networking strategy for telecentre networks===

Just like any for any type of organization, it is important to formulate the strategy of a telecentre network so it is best suited or prepared to meet the objectives it has set for itself. Formulating a suitable strategy for a particular TCN is therefore indispensable to obtain the best results. 

A simple way to consider strategy formulation to optimize telecentre networking begins by considering four key elements, as indicated in Figure 10.1 (Moreno, Mataix &amp; Acavedo, 2007). 

''' a) Architecture''' refers to the organizational network structure, and will identify its members and their intended relationships (transactions). The architecture should be conducive and coherent with the emergence of a corporate networked culture favouring collaboration and horizontal working relationships. 

''' b) Processes''' refer to the working procedures or methods to be implemented, or the modifications to existing ones, aimed at favouring networking (and in particular, collaboration). The ways of handling knowledge management and monitoring, evaluation and learning are among such processes.

''' c) Tools''' are the instruments or resources needed to implement the strategy according to the selected processes (and within the architecture already in place). Among the essential instruments for a successful networked strategy will certainly be a set of ICTs, but there are others: financial, physical infrastructure and facilities, events, etc. 

''' d) Capacities''' refer to the ability to carry out selected processes using the tools at our disposal. It includes both human and institutional capacities. Specific individual and collective capacity gaps relative to tools (e.g. ICTs) and processes (e.g. knowledge management) should be identified and measures designed to address them. This can range from training on digital collaborative platforms (i.e. groupware) to training about monitoring methodologies. 

[[File:Figure 10.1 Key elements for networking strategy.jpg|thumb|center|350px|Figure 10.1  Key Elements for Networking Strategy]]

This process requires a review of the aspects of TCN management as examined in Chapters 2 to 8 across these strategy elements, in order to determine with relative precision the elements of strategy that would be required to perform each management aspect satisfactorily. For example, when examining the aspect of participation, we can consider which components of the network’s architecture, processes, capacities and tools need to be in place.

When the review is thus carried out for all management aspects, we will have arrived at the crux of a strategy to maximize networking potential for our TCN. The results could be displayed in a matrix form like that sketched below. At this point it is highly likely we will find that many components of those four network strategy elements will serve for more than one of our network management aspects. For example, tools like content management systems and/or a web 2.0 type of community platform or groupware (like ning) will be applicable for participation, communication, content and services and M&amp;E and learning.

=== Aggregating and Enabling networks ===

[[File:Figure 10.2 A representation of a 2-D Network.JPG|thumb|Figure 10.2  A Representation of a 2-D Network]]
In terms of overall orientation of a network towards collaboration, we can broadly speak of two models: '''aggregating''' networks and enabling networks. An aggregating network pulls together contributions from their members (e.g. to generate a newsletter) or represents its members (e.g. for advocacy purposes or to defend members’ common interests). The connections in such networks are usually to either nearby (i.e. similar)&lt;ref&gt; ‘Nearby’ is not expressed literally, related to physical location, but rather in terms of identity, affinity, etc.  &lt;/ref&gt; nodes, or to the center node. In functional terms, their geometry is two-dimensional (2-D) or planar. Performance for aggreagting networks is measured in terms of joint actions undertaken by the network on behalf of the member nodes.

On the other hand, an '''enabling''' network seeks to strengthen the capacities of its members to achieve their individual objectives, particularly via collaborative tools and practices within as well as outside the network. The functional geometry of enabling networks is three dimensional (3-D) or spatial, where any node is free to connect with any other node, like the one in figure 10.2&lt;ref&gt; As in: in comparison with 2-D networks where nodes typically interact only with nearby nodes.&lt;/ref&gt;. In this case, performance derives from the number of collective activities undertaken by member nodes and supported by the network. 

Let’s characterize the two types of networks to better understand how they compare in functional terms (Acevedo, 2009):

! style=&quot;background:#00008B; color:#FFFFFF;&quot; | '''Aggregating network (2-D)'''
! style=&quot;background:#00008B; color:#FFFFFF;&quot; | '''Enabling network (3-D)'''
|-
| The central or principal node acts as the network '''coordinator''' (as in a secretariat or coordinating unit); it largely determines which nodes will carry out particular functions/actions, and will know about these actions in advance.  
| The main node (if there is one) acts as a network '''dynamizer''' or animator, providing resources and tools to favor networked activities among other nodes.
|-
| Established '''procedures''' are very important: network operations are based primarily on a series of norms or protocol that give order and regulate the network’s activities.
| Network operations proceed in an '''ad-hoc''' fashion (given the freedom and ease to establish productive relations among nodes), while adhering to a few basic institutional norms. 
|-
| '''Planning''' for the network is very important, since the central node (the ‘coordinator’ above) should direct resources and efforts towards their implementation. This determines a clear orientation towards &lt;u&gt;input-allocation&lt;/u&gt; management.
| '''Periodic monitoring''' is essential to know how the network is functioning, since it is not possible to plan all the possible collaborative activities among nodes. This points to a strong orientation towards &lt;u&gt;results-based&lt;/u&gt; management.
|-
| The network prioritizes '''access to information'''; the central node fosters the availability of the information and provides access systems. 
| The network prioritizes '''access to knowledge''' through the communication among nodes, the relationship with external entities and the systematization of information. The main node (if there is one) works on shared criteria for knowledge management, prioritizing the provision of tools/services that facilitate the efficacy of knowledge management.

It can be argued that enabling networks offer more adequate environments in relation to maximizing the collaborative potential of networks. They are focused on strengthening each member in relation to the member’s own objectives, primarily by providing tools/methodologies that favour the open collaboration of the members within the network (and also outside of it). This generates a much greater volume and range of collective, network-powered results than what could be derived from a network planned and directed by a central point. There are limitations to how well a coordinating unit can effectively and efficiently orchestrate the collective capacities of the nodes – and it will get more difficult as those capacities grow.

Moreover, by empowering their members to use networking methods to suit their specific purposes, enabling networks can encourage members’ own initiative and responsive attitudes. In this respect, such a structure takes more advantage of network traits such as relational freedom and flexibility. Conversely, embedding hierarchical practices into networked structures reduces the network’s possibilities. 

[[File:Figure 10.3 A representation of a 3-D or spatial network.png|thumb|center|400px|Figure 10.3  A representation of a 3-D or spatial network]]

Real development networks exhibit both profiles, activating desired traits as needed. For example, a TCN may follow a more aggregating approach when providing relevant information to its members, carrying out campaigns and acting as an important interlocutor to external governmental entities. However, when promoting projects, looking to expand resource mobilization or strengthening communications capacities, these networks act on their enabling mode.

&lt;div style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt;'''Box 10.1: Examining examples of aggregaing and enabling networks'''&lt;/div&gt;

'''&lt;center&gt;Aggregating Networks&lt;/center&gt;'''
'''Open-source programming networks'''. Most free/open-source software (FOSS) products are created by networks of skilled, volunteer programmers who use specific platforms and methods for program development (like ‘SourceForge’ in the picture). While the programmers will find support from the coordinators to make their work easier and more efficient, these networks are highly centralized. Essentially all the contributions from volunteers are meant to contribute to a single objective – the final software product. The network does not seek to deliberately strengthen the programmers (they are already rather skilled) nor their collaborative actitivies (collaborative methods are strictly set). Thus, these networks do not function in ad-hoc fashion; adherence to the procedures is mandatory.

'''Confederation of Spanish Development NGOs (CONGDE)''' ([http://www.congde.org www.congde.org]) 
CONGDE brings together NGOs in Spain that participate in development activities of all types. It is set up as a network, and some of its members are in turn regional networks that represent entities from parts of the country (Catalonia, Andalusia, etc.). Its mission is to coordinate and support the joint work of the member organizations. This is done through campaigns such as the one promoting the Millennium Development Goals, activities to educate the Spanish public about development, and most importantly by acting as interlocutor to the government and in policy-making fora. There are some services provided to members like training, promoting codes of conduct and information bulletins. So, while it exhibits some enabling traits, CONGDE functions more like an enabling-type network. 
[[Image:Congde.org website screenshot.png |thumb|center|650px]]

&lt;center&gt;'''Enabling Networks'''&lt;/center&gt;

'''Association for Progressive Communications (APC)''' ([http://www.apc.org www.apc.org])  
APC is possibly the best-known civil society organization in the Information Society and ICT for Development area. It is composed of country nodes, such as WOUGNET (Uganda), Colnodo (Colombia), GreenNet (United Kingdom), ArabDev (Egypt) or WomensHub (Philippines), represented in a Council, and it also has a small staff. While APC carries out corporate actions as an organization in its own right (e.g. it was very active in WSIS), it is constantly supporting its members to undertake their own projects (at the national level) as well as collaborative actions among them, in areas such as communications/information policy, access to infrastructure, strategic use of ICT, gender and ICT, etc. So it is mostly an enabling network, though displaying some clear characteristics of a aggregating network as well. 


'''International Year of the Volunteer 2001  (IYV2001)''' ([http://www.iyv2001.org www.iyv2001.org])  
The year 2001 was declared as the International Year of Volunteers by the United Nations to promote and visualize their contributions to development. The approach taken to operationalize its related activities was different than for other similar years. Instead of a few large events, it sought to energize the volunteer community worldwide to carry out a multitude of local and national events. For this, the UN Volunteers agency set up a small team in its Bonn offices whose responsibility was to enable and strengthen volunteer organizations worldwide to carry out IYV2001 related activities. An informal network of marked enabling characteristics emerged during a three-year preparation, in which people and institutions not only communicated with UNV’s team, but with many others through the internet’s platform set up for the year. The result was a resounding success, at almost no cost to the UN, and literally mobilizing millions of people worldwide. 
[[Image:Www.iyv2001.org website screenshot.png |thumb|center|650px]]
&lt;/div&gt;

If the assumption of favouring collaborative potential proves correct, then it is relevant to explore how to deliberately make the transition from aggregating to enabling network environments for TCNs. This entails focusing on the so-called generative capacities (Moreno ''et al.'' 2007), mentioned briefly in Chapter 2 on telecentre network governance. These are new and essential capacities in a knowledge-based, collaborative context (like our telecentre networks). The applicability of generative capacities extends beyond the individual (although they may still be useful) and into the collective realm. 

To promote and strengthen '''generative capacities''', we can follow a two-pronged approach. At the member (telecentre) level, these are capacities that focus on (i) learning, (ii) systemic vision, (iii) collective leadership, (iv) collaboration and (v) feedback (i.e. to the organization or the network). 

At the institutional (network) level, generative capacities are improved by actions led at management level, and complementary to outcomes sought at the member level, such as: 

* Producing flexibility in the modes of participation (so that ‘weaker’ telecentres or non-telecentre actors can also participate); 
* Training telecentres on collaborative techniques; 
* Promoting participatory monitoring and continuous feedback practices; and
* Designing projects as ‘networked’ initiatives. 

Networks are ideal environments to foster generative capacities, since they favour sharing and collective commitment. In turn, such capacities also help to construct creative and productive networks. 

A final remark about network strategy: a primary instance for participation, with a view to effective network management, should be precisely the time of determining its strategy. By the very nature of a network as a highly participatory organizational environment, the process of crafting its strategy should be open and participatory as well. Such a philosophy will not only result in a better strategy, but the process leading to it will already be developed as a practical exercise in common decision making – a very useful skill when working in networks. There are no tried-and-tested rules to set up and handle development networks. Much is learned along the way through trial and error. A truly participatory strategy then, despite some flaws and limitations, will have a stronger sense of collective commitment – including making the necessary corrections on the way.

=== Network analysis for telecentre networks ===

Even the best network management arrangements need to be validated, otherwise they can simply remain attractive institutional exercises with no clear return. The definitive measures for success will undoubtedly come from the results generated, both for the individual telecentres as well as for the overall TCN. However, a potentially useful previous step in assessing the success of a network (and possibly a decisive one in some cases) is to know whether we are indeed constructing and running the kind of network we had in mind. In other words, to respond to the question “What kind of network do we really have?” The answer to this question allows us to compare it with the intended design and clarify the direction we haven taken and are planning to move forward on.

For this we depend on network analysis, a set of methodological approaches, techniques and tools drawn from sociology that allow us to diagnose how a given network is functioning in order to manage it better. It’s similar to an internal organizational analysis often performed in companies, universities or government units, which helps determine whether they are set up as initially intended. This guidebook does not set out to provide a detailed design and instruction manual on performing a network analysis. However, it does encourage interested telecentre managers to consider exploring such type of analysis and describes briefly what may be involved – references are provided for further reading&lt;ref&gt;Including Anheir &amp; Katz (2005) and (2006), Arquilla &amp; Ronfeldt (1999), Kilduff &amp; Tsai (2008), and Nooteboom (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;.

Network analysis provides us with an understanding of the relationships among the nodes of a network. It examines complex personal or inter-organizational networks to reveal underlying patterns that are easier to recognize and thus to possibly re-shape. It is based on the functional structure of the networks rather than on the attributes of its nodes. 

In the case of a TCN, network analysis would focus on the relationships and transactions among the members (primarily the telecentres) rather than in the characteristics of the members (size, thematic orientation, urban/rural, etc.). This type of analysis gives us a relatively objective determination on whether the network as a whole is functioning as expected and whether potential changes have occurred in terms of the relationships among the nodes in order to improve its performance. 

There are different methodologies, and some will fit a particular TCN better than others. Anhier and Katz (2005) propose one for developmental (or more precisely, for NGO) networks, which could be applicable for TCNs. It includes five parameters to examine the relations among nodes, described in the following table together with one sample application for network management and for an individual telecentre: 

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;background:#800000; color:#FFFFFF;&quot; | '''Parameter'''
! style=&quot;background:#800000; color:#FFFFFF;&quot; | '''Network management group'''
! style=&quot;background:#800000; color:#FFFFFF;&quot; | '''Telecentre'''
|-
| '''Cohesion:''' characterizes the interconnection of social relations and their tendency to form areas of high relational density (hubs) where there are higher probabilities for links to exist or develop.
| What action areas of the network are drawing the most participation?
| Would it be possible for us to get involved in activities where few other telecentres participate?
|-
| '''Equivalence:''' describes to what extent the members of a network have similar relations with others, which helps to find zones or bands that facilitate the analysis by studying the relationships among those zones. 
| What are the different categories of network members based on their participation in the TCN?
| Are some of our needs shared and already satisfied by other telecentres? 
|-
| '''Prominence:''' identifies the prominent positioning of nodes in relation to others, which serves to visualize power relations.
| How is leadership evolving within the network, and is it convenient to stimulate some capable but little active telecentre managers?
| Are we leading work in an area which is of genuine interest for our community? 
|-
| '''Bridge:''' identifies nodes that connect groups of nodes (or networks) not connected through other links or paths. Identifying nodes with stronger bridging attributes helps to visualize/understand information flows and mobilization processes among groups.
| Which telecentres are pivotal in identifying project possibilities for others (including outside the TCN)?
| Do we have links to organizations through other networks or associations that could be valuable for our TCN?
|-
| '''Agency:''' refers to situations in networks in which an actor observes the possibility of connecting empty spaces or nodes. This helps to characterize the enterprising role of some nodes in the establishment and interconnection of networks. 
| Who are the real innovators in this network?
| What are the main unexplored aspects of content and services in the network, and where do we perceive demand from our users?
|-

It is important to recognize that a network analysis exercise will only provide a simplified picture of the complexity of social relations that exist in institutionally-rich environment like that of a telecentre network. Also, the analysis can be as simple or as sophisticated as we want, selecting network attributes/parameters that we care about. The important thing, particularly for TCN managers, is to pinpoint trends in behaviour and functional patterns that can be contrasted over time (e.g. over a five year period). The motivation is the same as for establishing network strategies in the first place: to have the most productive and effective possible TCN network.

=== Telecentre networks as national ICT policy actors ===

Telecentre networks are becoming significant actors in the definition and implementation of national policies dealing with ICT and the consolidation of inclusive information societies. This is because their telecentre members are involved in their day-to-day work at the community level, where they can play decisive roles in carrying out such policies and from where they can extract realistic expressions of popular ICT-related needs and demands to feed into the policy-making process. It is in the TCNs’ direct interest too: telecentre networks can be important actors in ICT policy shaping and development, contributing to policies that may be directed at supporting and strengthening them.

Telecentre networks will mainly get involved in such policy processes from the perspective (and for the aim) of digital inclusion. TCNs can play a key role in ensuring that digital inclusion is at the core of any national policies related to ICT or the information society. Moreover, from a developmental point of view they can add to pressure ensuring so that that ICT policies become intertwined with national development policies. Telecentres themselves, particularly in countries that are carrying out large telecentre programs, are the subject of ICT policies in relation to extending ICT access and capacity across a country. 

An example of how telecentres have become necessary actors for implementing ICT and information society related policies is the Brazilian ‘Digital Inclusion Program’ (Programa ID Brasil) of the Ministry of Communications ([http://www.mc.gov.br/ www.mc.gov.br]). It aims to deploy telecentres in all 5,500 Brazilian counties, quite an ambitious target. Thousands of city halls around the country received equipment already&lt;ref&gt;A typical telecentre kit consists of 10 computers, together with a server, monitoring unit with security video, a wireless router, laser printer, multimedia projector. It also includes the needed furniture, ie. tables, desks and chairs.&lt;/ref&gt;, and they had the responsibility of establishing the telecentres, whose common and stated purpose was to contribute to the digital and social inclusion of their communities through access to ICTs. The focus has been on small cities and villages in the countryside with deficient telecommunication infrastructure and notable barriers to access. The Digital Inclusion portal ([http://www.idbrasil.gov.br/ www.idbrasil.gov.br]) contains data about the progress of the program.

=== Volunteer programs for TCNs ===

Many successful telecentres enjoy the involvement of volunteers, who can carry a variety of supporting tasks for their telecentre:  

* To raise awareness about the telecentre it is important to understand the needs, problems and hopes of the various actors in the community, in order to determine what elements of information and ICTs may be more suitable. Frequent outreach to different groups and profiles of people will serve to make them more aware of the opportunities and practical uses of the technologies they can expect at their telecentre. 
* For information brokering since it is essential to help users find the right information for their needs and thus to get immediate practical benefits from the telecentre. The same could be said in terms of services, such as finding the right type of e-gov application for the specific needs of a user. 
* For basic ICT training, which is needed by many telecentre users, it is crucial to develop the skills for general use of computers, for creating content (e.g. word processing), for viewing images (e.g. digital pictures, scanning), and to use email and the Web. Some potential telecentre users may feel an initial ‘fear’ of computers, thus requiring ICT training to incorporate personalized attention and to be amenable – in order to learn to do things quickly which are fun and make people feel good about their progress.
* For building capacity, which takes place once the familiarity and basic skills are at hand. Meanwhile, it is important to ensure periodic monitoring of progress in applying the skills learned (and acquiring new ones) for well-defined purposes. Building capacity requires human interaction and understanding, which most effectively develop via direct and continued personal contact and exposure, something typical of volunteer work. Whether for advanced applications (website creation, digital video processing) or for simpler uses (e.g. finding market price information using email), where volunteers can build and expand the capacity of each individual user so s/he can really benefit from accessing and using ICT products and services. 

In other words, volunteers can help to achieve the most critical dimension of sustainability for telecentres; that is, social sustainability, by generating awareness, interest and ultimately demand from people in the community surrounding the telecentre. As such, volunteers are able to transform a ‘technology access community center’ into a ‘local development center with access to technology’ (Nath, 2001). The first is ‘instrumental’, essentially granting physical access to the internet and other ICTs, while the latter is ‘transformational’, promoting and supporting developmental processes with resources that include ICTs.

So what about volunteers and TCNs? Such networks are ideally placed to organize and manage TCN-wide volunteer programs&lt;ref&gt;In fact, international initiatives like telecentre.org could set up a type of “Telecentre Volunteer Exchange” facility, to allow people from successful telecentres to share their experience with others, given the proliferation of telecentres around the world.&lt;/ref&gt;. They can be oriented to support individual telecentres as well as to directly support the TCN structure itself (for exmample, help desks, a national telecentre academy, etc.). Such volunteers can be onsite or online. Onsite (physical) volunteers can essentially be locals who are interested in what the telecentres do and who could benefit by collaborating with them (gaining technical experience, connection time at a telecentre, etc.). At the national scale, partnerships can be formed with universities or companies to promote such volunteer programs. 

Online volunteers can also play a role. Specialized programs such as the UN’s Online Volunteering Service ([http://www.onlinevolunteering.org www.onlinevolunteering.org]) provide the infrastructure and mechanisms so that people around the world can collaborate through the internet with development-oriented organizations. They can help in the provision of content and services (particularly for quality control), designing websites, revising project proposals, adapting content, doing translations, moderating discussion fora, publishing e-bulletins, etc. The aforementioned website contains many examples of actual tasks performed by online volunteers. In fact we could envisage interesting possibilities for cooperation between onsite and online volunteers too.

=== Telecentres 3.0 ===
A key book about telecentres was written in 2006: “From the Ground Up: The Evolution of the Telecentre Movement”. It came at a turning point, after WSIS, when telecentres started gaining wider support again, after having been all but discarded by major international development agencies in their digital divide agendas. It appeared at the dawn of the telecentre movement, which in fact it helped to describe &lt;ref&gt;“From the Ground Up” is relatively frugal in terms of text, and it contains many images. In an elegantly produced volume that can easily pass for a coffee-table book, it managed to convey the essential concepts weaved around its stories and pictures. It almost seems to be saying that “the stories themselves tell ‘the story’ ” of the telecentre movement. It is accompanied by an online edition, and even a Flash version (see [http://ebook.telecentre.org/flash ebook.telecentre.org/flash).&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In looking to the future, ‘From the Ground Up’ serves as a lucid reference for all of us. It starts with the following: 

{{cquote|“Most early telecentres started with a modest goal: giving people a chance to access and learn about technology. A telephone, a photocopier, a computer, the internet. Yet telecentres have evolved. It’s no longer just about access and skills. Today’s telecentres use computers and the internet to do everything from improving public health to extending education to a wider audience to strengthening local democracy. No matter what they are called—telecentres, community multimedia centres, telecottages, village knowledge centres, community technology centres, telehuts, internet learning centres, community access points, library computer labs and so on—they share a common commitment: to help communities enter the information age and embrace the knowledge economy on their own terms. This is the telecentre movement today.”}}

[[File:Figure 10.4. Cover of ‘From the Ground Up’.png|thumb|center|Figure 10.4. Cover of ‘From the Ground Up’]]

The concluding chapter, entitled Telecentre 2.0, identifies “'''Seven things we still need (to scale up and scale sideways)'''”: 

* Flexible, responsive and innovative social investment mechanisms to support the establishment of new telecentres at the grassroots level.
* Well-packaged, easy-to-replicate community services for telecentres such as telemedicine, remote learning, financial remittances and e-government.
* Simple, proven social enterprise models that telecentres can use to generate community impact and financial revenue.
* Flexible, on going training and support for hundreds of thousands of grassroots technology activists around the world.
* Low-cost, easy-to-implement telecentre technology platforms, including affordable and stable internet connections for rural areas.
* Networks and partnerships that help good ideas travel far and wide —and help the telecentre movement reach a global scale.
* An enduring commitment to telecentres and other grassroots technology initiatives from all sectors: governments, businesses, development agencies and communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebook.telecentre.org/html/en/telecentre-2-0/ ebook.telecentre.org/html/en/telecentre-2-0] &lt;/ref&gt;

We could say that the sixth point about networks and partnerships has advanced significantly, with dozens of national and cross-national telecentre networks around the world&lt;ref&gt;Such as those participating in the telecentre.org initiative, such as Ugabytes, ATACH (Chile), the Bangladesh Telecentre Network, and many others.&lt;/ref&gt;. And yet we know they can deliver more than they do today – to take a deeper look at the how is the purpose of this guidebook. The intention has been for the previous chapters to assist in some way to advance on the other six points: how can networks help achieve that vision?

Three years later, in mid 2009, the telecentre movement has grown, with thousands of them springing up in diverse countries around the world. In India, the degree of telecentre growth is coherent with its vast scale: official policies focus on goals such as having as many telecentres that reach each one of its 600,000-plus villages, a tremendously ambitious objective. For successful stable growth (that is, sustainability), whether for large places like India or for other smaller countries or at the global sphere, '''the key is networking'''. This includes &lt;u&gt;smart&lt;/u&gt; networking that goes beyond simply joining together and adding efforts. &lt;u&gt;Creative&lt;/u&gt; networking builds on enterprising attitudes and innovative ideas. &lt;u&gt;Productive&lt;/u&gt; networking, through a mix of art and science, transforms limited resources into changes that make a difference to people. &lt;u&gt;Open networking&lt;/u&gt; encourages an inclusive approach to collaboration, an approach which ‘adds and never subtracts’. 

In looking ahead at the next two to four years (hardly any professional publication these days has a longer shelf-life) let us take a quick look at the Telecentre 2.0 precedent and propose factors for a vibrant Telecentre 3.0 stage (network-based, of course):

* Investment of public funds for telecentre networks (see the point below about building the ‘public good’ nature of telecentres) and encouragement of public-private initiatives to strengthen them (in terms of technologies, management, communications, etc.).
* Provision and delivery of content, services and other telecentre products via networked models, which can also move across networks (or countries).
* Decisive support and stimulus to social enterprise models for establishing and supporting telecentre networks, as well as for extending the range of telecentre offerings and services provided (e.g. a social enterprise offering telemedicine services through the telecentres).
* Support for network training initiatives tailored to telecentres (including the telecentre.org Academy). Encouragement of educational offerings for and from telecentre practitioners, including e-learning platforms that facilitate independent authorship (by telecentre staff or users), flexible course delivery and administrative tasks.
* Implement universal-service provisions managed nationwide through telecentre networks that deliver connectivity to telecentres which is free/low cost, dependable, hi-speed and ubiquitous. Mobile telephone infrastructure should be included to this end.
* Extension of telecentre networks to most countries (and among countries), with adequate telecentre network management methodologies, in ways to present TCN managers with one multi-actor, virtual ‘global telecentre ecosystem’ from where TCN members and partners can join.
* Integrate telecentres into national policies as (networked) public goods, and promote their role as publicly supported local development centres1. Introduce telecentre networks into wider development networks.

Throughout this guidebook, we have explored ways of '''encouraging greater networking between telecentres''' for the benefit of the men, women and children in the communities who will experience positive changes from the resources and support offered by their local telecentres. Its preparation has been a networked project in itself, with lead authors for each chapter that have been supported by others who have reviewed and/or provided some content, and a larger group in a dedicated section of telecentre.org, together with IDRC staff. We’ve all learned and will continue to do so through the debate and contributions to a new wiki book on telecentre networks. The initial version of this guidebook is simply the first contribution to a wiki that has an unending potential to grow. And throughout the process, a valuable asset is created: a type of networked social capital, the kind that stimulates collaboration across boundaries and extends collaborative opportunities limited only by the will and the imagination of those involved.

&lt;center&gt;'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Manuel Acevedo Ruiz&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''&lt;/center&gt;

This final chapter attempts to do two things: it will integrate the topics we have explored separately to provide a coherent picture, and it will put forth additional guidance to expand the potential and impact of our telecentre networks. 

=== How does it all come together? ===

In the previous chapters we explored the main issues that need to be paid attention to in order to make a telecentre network successful. While it may seem like a simplistic conclusion, the single most important message that emerges is that, '''in the end, networks are about sharing''', including knowledge, resources, vision, efforts, risks, failures… Sharing is mostly determined by attitude: it is a disposition more than an obligation. Thus, sharing (and by extension good telecentre network management) can best be &lt;u&gt;promoted&lt;/u&gt;, hardly enforced. 

This does not mean that we should simply resign to hoping that the people and organizations that make up a telecentre network will have a spontaneously positive, generous and productive attitude towards sharing. We wish it could be that easy… but that is not what one naturally starts with, even if a good general predisposition exists between those that come together in a network. This guidebook has been prepared because '''good intentions are not enough:''' the purpose is to provide useful knowledge about creating a fertile environment for sharing in our networks.

=== Threading a networked path ===

The challenge for telecentre network managers, and other people directly involved in network-wide operations, is how to '''deal with all the issues presented in the preceding chapters in parallel''': exercising a suitable governance style, taking measures to ensure financial sustainability, supporting telecentres to offer the right content and services, and so on, to occur simultaneously. 

In fact, network management is not a linear path from A to B&lt;ref&gt;Or A to M for that matter; we are not implying that the path is between two nearby points.&lt;/ref&gt;, since network structures are not linear. As we argue later on in this chapter, '''the most productive networks are three-dimensional'''. So making our way through the network involves going back and forth, and sideways, and up and down, and all combinations thereof. In other words, there is a destination (B) or more than one destination (B1, B2, etc.). The telecentre network manager&lt;ref&gt;And hopefully everyone else in the network too. &lt;/ref&gt; knows where he/she wants the network to go. Perhaps it is towards increasing the number of telecentres involved while diversifying sources of funding. Or it might be to stabilize a newly formed network, or finding out how to satisfy the demand for content and services to all member telecentres. 

Regardless of the ‘destination’, instead of moving one step at a time in a straight line, the movement appears more like a '''bouncing around within the network'''. If we were to draw a path, it might resemble squiggles drawn by a chile: many short lines with multiples directions and without apparent shape. 

Sound confusing? Well, just think that '''you are probably functioning in that way right now'''. As a network manager, you deal with many nodes (mainly telecentres) and with a variety of issues that affect both their individual operations and the interactions among them. One day you may go to some of the nodes (telecentres, or other organizations) to provide them with services, or to different nodes to get content, and still others to implement a new project. 

Tomorrow you may get the same nodes involved in different network actions, new nodes to perform those same actions or a mixed pack altogether. The point is that you are moving in a networked environment, threading your way around, while attempting to '''move the entire network in a specific direction''', that is, towards the network’s objectives.

=== An integrated view of telecentre network management ===

The point is that even though a telecentre network manager may bounce around a lot while doing his/her work, there is a certain and definite direction in which s/he wants to move the network, that is, '''toward its stated objectives'''. We can assume that network members will reach a consensus on those objectives, so that all are reasonably in agreement in terms of what they would like the network to achieve. 

While the aims may be clear, the path may be much less so. The fundamental responsibility of the network manager (and management team) is to set out the path and steer the network through it, through good analysis, proper decisions, and a collaborative leadership style coherent with a network environment. 

This bears some similarities to steering a large sailing ship. There are a variety of sails, each with a different purpose and effect. In addition, the load of the ship, attitude of its crew, quality of materials being carried, and atmospheric conditions, etc. will contribute to determining how the navigation goes and whether the ship gets to its destination according to plan. 

This guidebook has explored a set of issues that will determine to a significant extent how the network advances, and whether it will arrive at the port as expected (its objective). The network manager, together with those responsible for its ‘piloting’, will activate and modulate tasks related to network governance, communications, financial sustainability, ICT policy, etc. in the most properly balanced way for smooth navigation. It has already been mentioned that each of these issues is important and that they need handling in parallel, but for the sake of clarity, we have examined them separately and in relative isolation. We will therefore now try to describe some of their relations and inter-dependencies.

Let us now consider each issue in terms of how it is affected or impacted by others: 

* '''Network governance''': This is clearly one of the key determinants of how the network operates, with strong links to how its members interact (participation and communication), while setting the playing field for business models (sustainability) and taking in significant inputs from the monitoring, evaluation and learning functions.
* '''Financial sustainability:''' If this is not achieved (at least partially), the network may be short lived, but that doesn’t mean that it is strongly related to all internal network functions. The types and amount of content and services will strongly influence financial sustainability, as well as network governance (the ‘rules of the game’). In a healthy network environment, it will need a significant participatory attitude from its members (internally), while it can both contribute and benefit from international collaboration (externally). 
* '''Participation:''' Participation is one of the key defining characteristics of a network (without it, is hard to speak of a real network). It is the main channel for content and services and the basis for a well-functioning monitoring, evaluation and learning framework. It is also essential that the network adequately represents its members on ICT policy issues or for collaboration with other networks. It is hard to think of one area upon which it doesn’t have a strong influence. It is therefore one of the most important processes to stimulate in order for good results. 
* '''Communications:''' If participation is an embedded characteristic in all areas of the network, we could say that communication is the fuel (or the seed) that makes participation possible. And, like participation, it´s a sine-qua-non condition for a network – a set of non-communicating nodes does not make up a network. Communications, in turn, will be mainly enabled by adequate network governance, aside from the attitude of the participants and their cultural styles of course. 
* '''Content and services:''' These can be seen, using developmental jargon, as the ‘immediate objectives’ of a telecentre network – or as Hasan writes in Chapter 6, they are the ‘heart’ of a telecentre network. Network governance generates content and services, possibly including various types. Even more importantly, content and services require participation from the members of the network. In turn, they will strongly determine financial sustainability of the TCN. 
* '''Monitoring, evaluation and learning (M&amp;E and Learning):''' This function aims at at improving other aspects of telecentre network management, allowing for modifications based on evidence. In other words, M&amp;E and learning constitute the principal ‘navigational’ aid for the network to reach its objectives. It is a collective task and thus depends strongly on participation and communication. It is largely defined as part of network governance methods. While it will help to improve any aspect of TCN management, perhaps its most direct effect will be content and services (helping to understand what people think of them); and network governance (by introducing adjustments to the ‘navigation’ itself). 
* '''International TCN collaboration:''' This is a natural extension of networking done internally in the country. The results of that collaboration will be applicable to various areas but without a strong impact on any of them (as an external action, that impact cannot be guaranteed). Content and services or the work on ICT policy are areas that could possibly benefit the most. As for the internal drivers to get a TCN proactively involved in international collaboration, they are mainly participation (at least by some of its members) and network governance (setting the conditions to facilitate such collaboration). 

Let us pause for a minute to reflect upon these interactions. For example, &lt;u&gt;network governance&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;participation&lt;/u&gt; emerge as the single most determinant aspects of network management, since they have a strong direct influence on practically all other functions. &lt;u&gt;Communication&lt;/u&gt; is slightly less critical although still important since it fuels participation and sets the level of dynamism (or ‘temperature’) of the network. 

&lt;u&gt;Content and services&lt;/u&gt;, as the key ‘products’ of telecentre networks, require actions on essentially all fronts. Its most significant measurable effect will be financial sustainability – the intangible effects will be a more satisfied membership that can easily point to the benefits of being a part of the TCN.

&lt;u&gt;Financial sustainability and monitoring, evaluation &amp; learning&lt;/u&gt; have crosscutting effects, where the first powers actions while the latter facilitates change. On the other hand, the outward management aspect of is also cross-cutting with both short and longer-term effects (though more geared towards the middle-term effects). 

These considerations can and will change as a consequence of many factors, such as the maturity of a telecentre network, its political context, degree of heterogeneity or simply its size. Let’s imagine a big, state-instituted TCN that is largely financed by the government in a country with essentially non-democratic institutions. Perhaps its role in ICT policy could the most salient aspect, but participation may be less of a driver for the network’s success (in the sense of a participatory approach derived from stimulated individual imitative and not rigidly set). 

In any event, and whatever the shape or form of the telecentre network, &lt;u&gt;thinking about and driving the interactions&lt;/u&gt; of these areas of work is useful for managing a network properly. A TCN manager can base key decisions on expected consequences from the direct/indirect effects of such interactions. It will be as if s/he and her officers are facing a control panel of a modern ship, and can operate the various handles, levers and switches to set the most appropriate course for navigation. 
Let us explore these interactions a bit further in their network context.

=== Virtuous network effects ===

So far we have said that telecentre network managers have to skillfully navigate through their networks in order to stimulate or entice a whole set of actors (mainly telecentres) to '''share enough''' so that the network functions well and keeps members happy – and therefore, stay &lt;u&gt;inside the network&lt;/u&gt;. In order to do so, networks need to juggle a set of priorities, as discussed in the previous seven chapters. Fortunately, these priorities are not isolated, and handling one well often has a positive effect on others. This section explores these interdependencies and their related effects. 

Some of the overlap that you will have probably noted while reading through the previous chapters is inevitable. The reason is that the issues are '''inter-related''', sometimes strongly so. Let’s take a simple example of a sequence to illustrate, recognizing that there are many possible combinations. Financial sustainability depends on the content and services provided by the network. Those contents and services will be strongly dependent on the level of participation in the network. The participatory scheme will be determined to a large extent by how network governance is carried out. And the capacity and ability of network management will inevitably depend on the financial resources available to the network. 

Let us now look at a wider set of interactions, expanding on the key interactions between facets of management described in the previous section. For illustrative purposes, an indication of these interactions is reflected in the matrix below. We focus on a standard telecentre network, without any dominating or special features. Each cell is at the intersection of two issues, indicating how dependent the first one (located in the rows) is on the second one (located in the columns). For example, the cell Financial Sustainability intersecting with Network Governance indicates to what extent financial sustainability depends on network governance. Three values for the interactions are shown: &lt;u&gt;highly&lt;/u&gt; dependent (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #FF0000&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;), &lt;u&gt;somewhat&lt;/u&gt; dependent (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #DA70D6&quot;&gt;lavender&lt;/span&gt;) and &lt;u&gt;not very&lt;/u&gt; dependent (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #4169E1&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;).

A detailed consideration of each interaction between each intersecting issue is beyond the scope of this chapter. It is instead meant to provide a simple visual approximation to the relationship between the various issues. Nevertheless, some reflections emerging from the exercise are worth mentioning:

* There is a relatively high level of inter-dependency among the various issues (few of the cells are blue);
 
* The relationships are not necessarily symmetrical. For example, the content and services provided in a network are highly dependent on network governance. However, network governance depends little on existing content and services;

* The matrix serves to quickly identify how a satisfactory performance in one category can have a range of possible positive indirect effects (besides the effects deduced from direct interaction), that is, the '''virtuous network effects''' alluded to in the title of this section. For example:
** Communication depends strongly on participation;
** Participation strongly depends on the style of network governance; and, 
** Network governance is strongly linked to monitoring, evaluation and learning.

So for example – and without taking the relationships too strictly or seriously…&lt;ref&gt;There are many jokes that exploit linking a chain of relations in a linear way. For example, about someone who likes the sea; a person who likes the sea will like walking on the seashore; someone who likes walking on the seashore likes to walk barefoot; someone who likes to walk barefoot probably has hippie-like friends; some one who has hippie-like friends will likely have listened to 60s US rock bands like the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Starship or the Jimi Hendrix Experience. But it would be quite a long shot to say thtat because you like the sea, you must be a Greatful Dead or Jimi Hendrix fan. :-D&lt;/ref&gt; – we could say that doing a good job in monitoring, evaluation and learning will have an indirect but real effect on communication and participation because of its improvements on network governance. For instance, this would be in addition to the direct effects on communication and participation strategies that can be directly drawn from applying recommendations from M&amp;E and learning actions.

The cumulative effect of direct and indirect effects can become rather substantial because of the high number of inter-dependencies. This elevates the rewards for performing well on each of the categories identified for network management. And it points to the level of virtuous network effects that could be linked.  

The matrix exercise provides only a rough approximation, perhaps a good starting point, for a finer level of analysis. Its results will certainly differ from network to network. But it is a valuable management exercise, one that we recommend to you – if possible, together with several of your colleagues in the network. Appendix 10.1 contains a blank matrix for you to print out and analyze on your own – and compare it with the one we have discussed or with the ones prepared by your colleagues.  

&lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #E0FFFF; border: solid 1px #00a5ff; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;center&gt;'''''Box 9.1: What are the Seven Strategies for Building Successful Telecentres?'''''&lt;/center&gt;

Here, the reader can find a different approach to consider network effects, this time applied to individual telecentres. It was posted to the telecentre.org intranet by Azul, who is the Head of Telecentre Excellence at Warisan Global Sdn Bhd, in Malaysia. 

The image below indicates the seven strategies Azul considers most important for successful telecentres. She reflects: “What I consider important may not be important to you and vice versa. The way we ‘chunk’ things may also be different. We have many ways of &quot;cooking&quot; a telecentre dish.” 

[[File:Box 9.1 What are the Seven Strategies for Building Successful Telecentres.png|thumb|350px|center|Box 9.1: What are the Seven Strategies for Building Successful Telecentres?]]

And then she follows with a key message: “The Seven Strategies are connected with each other. &lt;u&gt;Interdependent&lt;/u&gt;”. This interdependency relates directly to our argument in this chapter that the various aspects for managing telecentre networks are inter-related and that there are virtuous network effects that can be derived from a truly integrated approach to TCN management.

&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;Kemly Camacho&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt;

This chapter presents some of the basic elements for conducting an evaluation process of telecentre networks. Evaluation is not a fixed recipe, but should be tailored to each case; that is, the same design cannot be applied to all telecentre networks. But there are certain guidelines that can be observed for specific types of evaluations, such as those for development projects, political campaigns or, in our case, telecentre networks. For this reason, in this chapter we focus on one particular case, with an explanation of the main steps to be followed.

It is essential for a given evaluation to set out its specific purpose, questions, categories, variables and indicators, as well as tailor its methodology. This implies tailoring the data gathering techniques, analysis and dissemination of the results to the purpose and object of the evaluation exercise. An evaluation is basically a type of research that aims to provide inputs for decision-making, and must therefore meet the same rigorous requirements as an investigative process.

=== Describing the Evaluation Process ===

Figure 8.1 outlines the evaluation process. The circles indicate the main threads, the arrows represent the flow between them, and the boxes show the main products of each process.
&lt;!-- ------------- figure ---------------- --&gt;

[[File:Figure 8.1 A Description of the Evaluation Process.jpg|thumb|400px|center|Figure 8.1 A Description of the Evaluation Process]]
 

&lt;!-- ------------- figure ---------------- --&gt;
Figure 8.1 represents an example of an approach to the evaluation process for a telecentre network. Some of the steps and questions can be applicable to the reader’s own telecentre networks. The intention is to provide a useful reference as a guide for the elaboration of other evaluative processes that are adaptable to the needs of the specific network. 

It is important to note the indicators presented within the evaluative framework. Due to the influence that the logical framework has had in the evaluation processes and the design of development programs, it has been assumed that indicators are “objectively verifiable values”. Clearly, what we propose does not follow this traditional belief and bets on what is called “indicative indicators”. These can be described as a series of statements that the person who designs the evaluation creates from his/her knowledge on the subject, to determine how a variable in the evaluated program or project is being addressed. These indicative indicators do not seek a rating or a measurement, but rather an assessment. It is also recommended that they are created in collaboration with the people involved in the project, in this case, with the telecentre network.

==== Demarcation I: Defining the entity to be evaluated ====

First, it is necessary to determine the boundaries for an evaluation by defining the entity to be evaluated, and its major guiding questions. In this case, we could define the ‘object’ as follows: '''a development-oriented national telecentre network.''' 

This implies two things: that the objective is to evaluate a telecentre network, and thus the process does not focus on assessing the functioning of a single telecentre but rather the operation of telecentres as a network, including their support organizations. Moreover, this is an evaluation &lt;u&gt;process&lt;/u&gt;; that is, it is assumed that the network is functioning, or that it exists and is active at the time that the evaluation is being developed.

==== Demarcation II: Formulating evaluation questions ====

The questions asked help to set the boundaries of an evaluation. It is not possible to assess all areas of a given evaluation object. These questions help us to understand which aspects will be prioritized in the evaluation. An evaluation question is not just any question: it is analytical, investigative and cannot be only a descriptive one. An example of a main evaluation or research question could be formulated as &lt;ref&gt;There would be other basic evaluation questions, such as those related to the support or benefits for the individual telecentres, etc.
&lt;/ref&gt;: 

'''To what extent does the &lt;u&gt;networking&lt;/u&gt; of telecentres improve the opportunities for the &lt;u&gt;digital inclusion&lt;/u&gt; of people who have fewer opportunities to access information and communication technologies?'''

It is explicit in the question’s formulation that what we want to evaluate is the influence that networking is having on social transformations through digital inclusion processes.

When conducting an evaluation, various areas of analysis may be chosen depending on the case, and they may be linked from the evaluative question(s). Make sure that the questions are evaluative and not descriptive; that is, that they are analytic. To put it more simply, the questions cannot be answered with a quick answer such as ''“yes”'' or ''“no”''.

==== Design I: The evaluative framework ====

In order to carry out any monitoring or evaluation process, we must operationalize the key evaluation question(s). For this we create what is called the ‘&lt;u&gt;evaluative framework&lt;/u&gt;’. This will serve as a guide to operationalize the question and to determine how to evaluate the social phenomenon. The evaluative framework depends on what will be assessed (object), the time frame covered for activities (starting, on process, recently completed, completed some time ago), the type of evaluation (that is, if it is done by someone of the same network or someone outside the network), if it is participatory or not, among others.

Following a rigorous evaluation process, once the object and main evaluation question is defined, the latter is broken down into secondary questions, categories of analysis, variables and indicators (if applicable). Once the evaluation framework is designed, the methodology needs to be defined, including the evaluation approach and the related tools and techniques with which this will be investigated. One such evaluative scheme is detailed below, with the steps are illustrated in the table below:

==== Design II: The line of intention ====

When designing an evaluative framework, as the one used as example in Box 8.1, we are making a series of assumptions based on the knowledge of what the evaluation object is supposed to do or achieve. This set of assumptions, once validated with the appropriate stakeholders, becomes the so-called ‘program theory’ or ‘line of intention of the program’. In this case, the program is a telecentre network, and some of the assumptions composing its line of intention can be stated as follows: 

* Network implies a strengthening of each of its members through mutual aid, knowledge sharing and the development of joint projects;
* Networking increases and strengthens the amount of support that members of the network, and the network itself require;
* There is greater potential for impact on technology and digital inclusion policies, which positions telecentres as an option for people with fewer opportunities, because networking clarifies the role of these social actors;
* The telecentre network is aimed at meeting the demands and needs of a population with fewer possibilities of accessing development opportunities such as education, health, and income generation, among others;
* The population is indeed targeted and served by the network, and that the services offered are aimed to meet their needs, visions, demands; and in so doing it is adapted to the context of this &lt;ref&gt;This will transform the resources of these populations to establish relationships with various actors at national and international levels, which involve finding new opportunities related to income generation and use of leisure time.
&lt;/ref&gt;; 
* A true ICT integration in these populations will involve new communications processes, new information resources and therefore, new ways of developing one’s own knowledge.

All these aforementioned processes will result in a greater recognition of ICTs as tools of opportunity and that a telecentre network can have an impact that produces a transformation in this population. All these assumptions that make up the line of intention are subsequently monitored and evaluated to properly identify them. The line of intention is usually not previously elaborated. Thus, before initiating an evaluation process, it is advisable that this line of intention is elaborated in conjunction with the stakeholders. This will be the basis of the evaluation.

Figure 8.2 presents the line of intention in this telecentre network. It outlines the way in which the network is supposed to help transform reality. It allows clarification of what we are trying to do when creating a telecentre network. As the reader can see, it is directly linked to the evaluative framework presented in Box 8.1 above.

&lt;!-- ----      figure             ----------- --&gt;

==== Research ====

Once the evaluation purpose, framework and line of intention are defined, the fieldwork for the evaluation of the telecentre network can be started. This involves using the sources described in the evaluative framework (Box 8.1) to retrieve the information and data necessary to make the assessment. This includes developing the right tools and methods to approach these sources.

Surveys, interviews, life stories or observation are instruments that require the development of particular tools and methods. For the purposes of this paper, these instruments will not be described in detail here, but is important to note that they must be designed before starting to capture information. It is also important to point out that each variable has its own associated techniques and instruments for data and information collection.

==== Assessment – responding to questions ====

How the data will be analyzed must also be determined in advance, for which quantitative, qualitative or participative &lt;ref&gt; participatory actions are highly recommendable in the case of a telecentre network&lt;/ref&gt; are necessary by integrating the involved stakeholders into discussions and analysis. The data analysis must respond to the indicators, variables, questions and categories previously designed.

It is important to think of evaluation as a research process that allows making an informed value judgment. As such, it is meant to provide guidance with the decision-making on, for example, (i) the correction or continuation of network activities, (ii) the most appropriate use of financial support, (iii) the integration of new support to the network (e.g. local government or private enterprise) or (iv) changing the direction/the organizational transformation of the network.

==== Reporting back ====

A very important phase of the evaluation process is the presentation of results. This must be adapted to the language, media and various populations that have participated. It is the duty of the evaluator to present the results to each of the populations who have been consulted. In the case of telecentre networks, it is therefore important to report back to telecentre users, supporting organizations, and public sector, aside from telecentre managers and staff.

==== Risks ====

If the process presented here is not properly followed, a number of common mistakes can be committed, such as:

* Using the evaluation to control and punish, instead of to learn and improve;
* Understanding the evaluation as a measurement, rather than an assessment;
* Considering the evaluation as a “creation of indicators”;
* Considering that to “evaluate” means to “apply a survey”;
* Considering that to “evaluate” means to “collect successful stories”.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Ndaula Sulah – UgaBYTES, Uganda'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Telecentre people like to work, share and learn together. This occurs in a multiplicity of ways and intensities. Information sharing is often triggered by enthusiastic people who want to learn or by people who want to help their friends do better – either informally or formally. Together, these two groups form the creative core of any telecentre network. When these people are in managerial positions or have a high level of responsibility in telecentre networks, collaborations can quickly turn international. 

Telecentre network collaboration is increasing as TCNs continue to encounter benefits from working together. It has helped in the establishment of new telecentre networks and in the strengthening others. Collaboration is also the foundation of telecentre.org community, a community of people and organizations working together to improve the social and economic impact of grassroots telecentres. 

This chapter discusses the benefits of international network collaboration and the ways in which networks can collaborate. It also aims to examine the future of network-to-network collaborations and the extent to which the partnerships will be valued and used by members. It also highlights the example of the global '''telecentre.org Academy''' as a case study, which since 2008 has provided the ground for collaboration for networks and institutions in Spain, Colombia, Philippines, and Brazil among many others. 

=== Potential and experiences arising from collaboration across telecentre networks ===

A telecentre network loses its capacity to support, analyze and strengthen telecentres as soon as it stops learning. That is why since 2005, telecentre.org has been at the front of fostering network collaboration and creating new networks. The broad aim of telecentre.org in this context is to connect people and networks, build social capital, facilitate partnerships and sow the seeds of new networks by regularly convening telecentre leaders and champions to share their knowledge.

The benefits of telecentre network collaborations may include:

* '''New services and products''' – Such as the telecentre.org Academy (as reviewed in the case study in this chapter);

* '''Improving network operation''' – Such as the Kenya Nework of Telecentres (KenTel) which developed its network strategic plan through collaboration with UgaBYTES;

* '''Opportunities for network staff exchange''' – For example, where networks from Burkina Faso and Mali collaborated to develop services and online resources;

* Alliances that require efforts for '''multi-stakeholder resource''' mobilization and bigger task accomplishment;

* '''Solving problems''' (short and long-term) based on information and knowledge sharing. 

==== Emerging forms of international networking ====

The rise of telecentre network collaboration has taken three main stages, '''personal connections, informal networks and formalized networks'''. For example, the telecentre.org initiative has been supporting networks through the transformation through these stages, where it now acts as a ‘clearance house’ for many telecentre networks and moving towards formalizing into a networks’ network. 

In its beginning phase from 2003 to 2005, telecentre.org depended on personal connections and focused on information gathering and knowledge sharing at the global level. It was concerned mostly with skills identification and engagement from existing networks all over the world. But in the process, it built complex informal networks that would later lead to its present, already significantly formalized, stage. 

At the launch of telecentre.org in 2005 there were very few TCNs, among them UgaBYTES in Uganda, Somos Telecentros in Latin America, SchoolNet in Bangladesh and the Telecentre Association of South Africa (TASA). The emergence of the telecentre.org initiative had a strong catalyzing effect, and since then, more than 45 telecentre networks or associations have been formed, some of which are included in the table below:

&lt;/div&gt;

The importance of informal networks cannot be underestimated, and deserve support and cultivation even if they are hard to manage, as exemplified by telecentre.org. Three types of networking modes can be highlighted in informal networks, namely &lt;u&gt;advice networks&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;trust networks&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;communication networks&lt;/u&gt;. However, none of them operates in isolation, as illustrated by the example drawn from the Telecentre Times, below. 

&lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #E0FFFF; border: solid 1px #00a5ff; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Box 7.1: The Telecentre Times: a case for international collaboration among networks'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The Telecentre Times ([http://www.ugabytes.org/telecentretimes www.ugabytes.org/telecentretimes]) story is energizing as a success of inter-network collaboration. In 2005, telecentre.org organized the first Global Telecentre Leaders' Forum as a side event to the World Summit on the Information Society. In their leisure time, network leaders chatted and shared. Part of the many ideas that went around was one by D.Net, [http://dnet-bangladesh.org dnet-bangladesh.org], (Bangladesh), Sarvodaya [http://www.sarvodaya.org www.sarvodaya.org] (Sri Lanka) and UgaBYTES [http://www.ugabytes.org www.ugabytes.org] (Uganda)&lt;ref&gt;In fact, the discussion started as a simple midnight talk between Ndaula Sulah of UgaBYTES and Harsha Liyanage of Sarvodaya in Sri Lanka. &lt;/ref&gt; to develop a project together. This continued on as a conversation lasting for about another year. 

The idea to create a Telecentre Times magazine gained ground, and it would later attract support from telecentre.org for a face-to-face follow-up meeting in Sri Lanka, with advisory support from telecentre.org. The meeting was also attended by D.Net, which resulted not only in the establishment of the Telecentre Times, but also in the expansion of another telecentre.org project, the '''Helpdesk''', for Bangladesh. 

In the process of improving the English version, the telecentre.org team provided reviews and advisory support while the other networks took the role of collecting the articles, designing and disseminating the publication to UgaBYTES. Other networks also supported the editorial team at UgaBYTES. And through sharing lessons, other networks have now translated the publication into their local languages. 

As the people involved got to know each other and built up trust, the process moved forward quickly and today the Telecentre Times is also published in French, Arabic and Bengali (in addition the initial English version). The process now requires minimal involvement of the initial players, while still benefiting from some telecentre.org support.

The Telecentre Times exemplifies a good example of a product of knowledge management achieved through inter-network collaboration. It captures periodical grassroots telecentre innovations, experiences, novel solutions and many more, and it globally disseminates them in a single publication, through regional networks, websites and mailing lists. 

As a paper publication, it can be pleasantly read while sipping tea without having to turn anything on (except the light, if it’s dark…). 

&lt;/div&gt;

Like when building a network, network collaboration thrives on trust and good relationships. It may be informal or informal. Networks need opportunities to develop the necessary trust as well as ongoing ways of nurturing and deepening relationships. Often, collaboration starts with a face-to-face meeting. Relationships grow faster when networks work together on a concrete activity of mutual benefit and maintain regular communication. They learn to understand and value each other more and more. Therefore, concrete projects such as the Telecentre Times have a kind of ‘double value’: as products of network collaboration as well as in sparking future collaborations among TCNs.

Effective network collaboration also needs leadership and mentoring. As we saw in the case of the Telecentre Times, telecentre.org provided resources for face-to-face meetings, occasionally facilitating online conversations and providing advisory support on a variety of issues. Additionally, telecentre.org encourages and facilitates documentation and sharing of experiences across networks involved in the publication.

==== Experiences in network collaboration ====

Networks (and thus their individual nodes) have much to gain from collaboration. As pointed out, together they find innovative solutions to challenges, develop new products, build up community development resources and strengthen institutional capacities. 

In East Africa, UgaBYTES brought together network leaders and helped East African national networks like the Kenya Network of Telecentres (KenTel), Burundi Community Telecentre Network (BCTN), Tanzania Telecentre Network (TTN) and Rwanda Telecentre Network (RTN) to work more closely together. UgaBYTES contributed to the development of the mailing list and the website of the French network in Mali (Afriklinks), while Mozambique sent a representative on a one-week staff exchange program to Uganda in order to share experiences between UgaBYTES and the CAICC (The Community Information and Communication Support Centre in Mozambique). Telecentre networks in Latin America started a regular networking Skype chat in 2007. Community content facilitators based in Egypt, Peru, Uganda, India, Sri Lanka, Spain and Benin are also holding regular online chats to share strategies. 

Networks have collaborated to create and manage telecentre helpdesks. Helpdesks are forums that enable telecentre practitioners to access support on demand. They use instant messenger (such as Skype, yahoo), emails, telephone and fax among other technology options. There are helpdesks in Portuguese (run by CAICC in Mozambique), in English (run by UgaBYTES in Uganda and the Bangladesh Telecentre Network), in French (run by Afriklinks, the Réseau des Télécentres du Burkina in Burkina Faso) and in Spanish (run by CEPES in Peru). Network leaders regularly discuss how to make the helpdesks effective, accessible and sustainable.

Bilateral, project-oriented collaborations are also occurring. One example involves Brazil’s Telecentre Information and Business Association (ATN) and its exchanges in Mozambique for content adaptation (both being Lusophone countries) and capacity building programs for telecentre operators. The counterpart in Mozambique is the Eduardo Mondlane University (UEM) in Maputo&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.uem.mz/ www.uem.mz]&lt;/ref&gt;, a pioneer in providing internet access that has also helped other digital inclusion initiatives.

==== Challenges to inter-network collaboration ====

Network collaboration can offer substantial benefits, but it is not without its challenges. Telecentre network collaborations are constrained by the fact that most networks are not at the same level of development, with some just in the emerging stages while others are well established, perhaps causing a barrier to fluid integration. For instance, it is a significant challenge to agree on procedures and requirements across networks at the stage of emerging large services, because most TCNs are in their initial stages, after all. Advanced members in this position typically feel that collaboration is less rewarding and does not provide mutual benefits. Let us examine other challenges for network collaboration:

* '''Participation''': Most of the time networks actively engage in collaborating in activities of their choice and interest. But a few individuals and networks may appear to collaborate without actually contributing. This skews the process of sharing and learning. And its negative results end up reducing network collaborations. 

* '''Coordination and control:''' There is a saying that everybody’s responsibility is nobody’s responsibility and that somebody will blame everyone for not doing something about that responsibility. In network collaboration there is a very big dilemma in resolving this phenomenon. Members are afraid that once one of them is chosen to coordinate, it is easy for that network to take the credit and in the end assume a controlling role. Or worse even, that once your network is picked to coordinate, you will have to perform all the work!

* '''Inclusion and focus:''' Most network collaborations draw on people interested in a specific part of the collaboration – such as about a telecentre.org Academy, staff exchange, or social enterprise models. This approach risks losing out on useful people who are not necessarily interested in several specific themes. A broader inclusion, on the other hand, opens up many opinions and perspectives, although it requires more complex coordination.

* '''Process and structure:''' Network collaboration may start from personal contacts and via informal processes before focusing on concrete actions. There is no standard time for network collaboration to mature. The one thing we know, however, is that if networks change the collaborative dynamics too early, the process may fail.

=== Case study – The telecentre.org Academy ===

The telecentre.org Academy is a global initiative to provide telecentre managers with ongoing training, capacity building, and professional development opportunities. Structured as a consortium of national academies and partners with a small global support unit, the academy supports and coordinates training programs, promotes the collaborative development and sharing of resources, and maintains accreditation and certification standards. At the global level, the telecentre.org Academy does the following:

* Establishes national academies in partnership with academic institutions, government, NGOs, and the private sector, and provides support for business and sustainability planning;

* Sets standards to accredit national academies and develops a certification scheme that recognizes telecentre managers' training achievements as well and skills gained through work experience; 

* Supports the development of open curricula and promotes the creation, coordination, and improvement of common resources;

* Facilitates events, networking, and knowledge sharing activities, including engaging the community to contribute to a shared, multilingual repository based on UNESCO's Open Training Platform (to include curricula, certification standards, best practices, models, list of experts, etc.) 

* Develops a web-based learning management system;

* Establishes partnerships to secure additional resources and support, encouraging other training organizations, technology companies and donor organizations to join as partners in the academy;

* Reaches out to governments and donors supporting telecentres to help them incorporate continuous and sustainable capacity building into their program design.

At the national or regional level, each academy localizes materials, delivers training, and links managers to ongoing mentoring and coaching opportunities. The telecentre.org Academy is a participatory initiative, where national academies and TCNs come together to determine the direction and activities of the global support unit.

==== Background ====

The telecentre.org program initiative was launched in 2005 with a commitment to developing the management capacity of telecentre practitioners and network managers around the world. It was clear that any initiative that would respond to this need would have to be owned by the telecentre community and be led by national networks. The initiative would need a multitude of reputable stakeholders like government, universities and other training and curriculum development bodies. Simply put, the initiative required more complex partnerships than could be developed in Ottawa (where telecentre.org was based), if the academy was to be a truly global training infrastructure.

For that reason, telecentre.org spearheaded discussions and provided grants for some networks that were picking up the idea. Involved networks shared their experiences through workshops, telecentre leaders’ forums, and online spaces. Now, national academies have been established in Spain, Colombia, and the &lt;u&gt;Philippines&lt;/u&gt;, which are to be followed by Peru, Chile, Brazil, Sudan, Egypt, India, and Mozambique with other academies in the pipeline. It is expected that by 2012 the telecentre.org-supported academies will have trained one million people.

==== How it works ====

The telecentre.org Academy is built on global network collaborations. It is focused on ensuring multi-stakeholder involvement and as such it has remained oriented to building trust and stimulating adaptation of its work to the needs of TCNs around the world. It fosters global debate through an open discussion forum at [http://www.telecentre.org/groups/telecentreacademy www.telecentre.org/groups/telecentreacademy], and it contributes training materials to the &lt;u&gt;Open Training Platform&lt;/u&gt; run by UNESCO.It also professionalizes, motivates, and supports one million telecentre knowledge workers in the making. 

Telecentre.org invites national TCNs to set up their own national academies, committing to help them establish a national-level training system for telecentre workers that use telecentre.org's &lt;u&gt;Curriculum Commons resources&lt;/u&gt;. Thus, in the Academy, telecentre.org provides space to members as well as being an active partner, since it also contributes resources, materials and logistics.

==== Early Outcomes ====

The key result from the telecentre.org Academy so far is a strengthened operational capacity for hundreds of thousands of telecentre practitioners, as more networks incorporate the academy as part of their national training programs. 

But other things have also happened as a result of this engagement. As an example, the international collaboration activities strengthen the bargaining power of the telecentre community, and it has therefore become simpler for national networks to engage with other partners like universities to support the training agenda of their telecentres.

=== Quick tips on international telecentre network collaboration ===

* '''Embrace ‘win-win’ situations'''. Right from the start, establish a give-and-take exchange as you begin to build a network. Let all the content for the interaction depends on what’s happening in each participating network’s objectives, strategy, brand, products, services and member experiences; such that everyone feels that he is gaining in one way or the other. The goal should be on how to increase your knowledge and how you will benefit your diverse members.

* '''Create results and define processes aimed at successful relations'''. In cases where you have meetings or collaborative engagements, design your meetings to achieve results, process and relationship success. Clear desired outcomes, agendas and effective facilitation to support results and process satisfaction.

* '''Include members from diverse functions and industries'''. If you have supporters based on a particular sector (and with differing job functions) include them; this cross-pollination of partnerships and functions adds depth and breadth to networks’ communication and it creates diversity of thought, new perspectives, and alternative approaches to problem solving. 

* '''Build trust'''. For meaningful collaborations to happen, there should be a certain level of trust between actors. However, trust takes time to build up: it cannot happen overnight, and everything that happens either builds or destroys the trust (where it´s easier to destroy than build). Using interactive collaborations tools to build and maintain trust as well as undertake collaborative works is the best way to get to know a partner.

* '''Get your own website'''. First, having and maintaining a website for your network is key to open up to the rest of the world. It gives you a communication platform for all that you do and a market to sell your ideas for whoever is interested. The telecentre.org website has proved to be one of its most powerful tools in enhancing collaborations.

* '''Meet face-to-face'''. Meeting people face-to-face remains one the most effective ways to work together, manage knowledge and develop trust. In the telecentre community, several telecentre leaders’ forums – global, continental, regional, and national – have been organized. Since they are expensive and time consuming, their objectives should be thought out carefully to justify the effort.

* '''Take advantage of online social networks'''. Today, one of the most common methods of networking is through online social networks. In general, the idea is to create a place where network leaders, members, and all stakeholders can meet to exchange experiences at the lowest cost: online of course. Some of these spaces include ning, Facebook, or Twitter. 

* '''Use online communication channels'''. Once you have Internet access, you may need to engage in cheap and powerful online communication channels like Skype (for voice and video)&lt;ref&gt;Skype, for example, is used for the African Telecentre Network Leaders' monthly meeting and the community facilitators' weekly meeting. &lt;/ref&gt;. List servers/online forums remain essential communication channels that make it easy to share and collaborate ideas asynchronously, regardless of locations. Blogs provide a simple and yet powerful means of sharing and collaborating on key issues of network enhancement, from anywhere (as they are web based).

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;
&lt;center&gt;'''Mahmud Hasan (Bangladesh Telecentre Network)''' &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

If communications are the ‘nervous system’ of a telecentre network, as expressed in Chapter 4, we could say that content and services are at the heart of a telecentre. It is through content and services that a telecentre serves the development challenges of its community and therefore provide opportunities for improved livelihoods.

Telecentre networks have a unique advantage in developing content and services. Networks may use their collective power to attract content and services originally developed by other organization – and then modify them for their own purposes. Networks may also engage directly in content and services development. This chapter discusses attributes and types of adequate content and services for telecentres, and how a telecentre network can play a central role in their provision. Examples are provided along the way about TCNs engaging in this process, drawing on a case study that looks at the Bangladesh Telecentre Network and its content and services development plan.

Since 2006, telecentre.org has supported a number of networks around the world to develop content and services that telecentres can use. This support has been linked to overall sustainability of telecentre networks. This is because telecentre.org believes that good content and services best advance the value of telecentre networking and are therefore key to sustainability for the telecentres. 

=== The role of telecentre networks in the provision of content and services for local communities ===

Creating or even adapting the proper content or service packages for a particular community is an expensive and time-consuming job; and it is even more difficult for individual telecentres to create content and services. 

Moreover, providers of content and services activities may not want to work with just one telecentre and its relatively limited constituency. But the aggregate level of demand of a group of telecentre practitioners can make the relationship more attractive. 

There is an increasing recognition that networks can leverage content and services development, including the creation, packaging, training and provision of support services. Those content and services activities can then be replicated and distributed at the local and international level (such as through other TCNs). Herein lies the power of a telecentre network.

A telecentre network can also provide a channel for validation and feedback for content and service providers. This is an invaluable opportunity for any provider. 

Individual telecentres can contribute to content development from telecentre networks by gathering information and knowledge from their communities. This may cover farming processes, trading opportunities, traditional herbal medicine, or local cultural practices for example. Telecentres have become a key source of data about local communities by development agencies and research organizations. 

One interesting experience comes from telecentre.org’s support of a number of networks and organizations to develop services through the competitive Rural Innovation Fund in India. These services included:

* A delivery model for Tara Akshar, a computer-based literacy program that teaches adult illiteracy in Hindi in 30 days. The service also developed a training system that integrates NGO and community based organizations as partners;

* Primary eye care through rural vision centres. The service was meant to increase access eye to care in rural India in order to reduce blindness;

* School management software to improve administration and teaching;

* An e-Commerce village web portal that provided communities with access to information, goods and services;

* A village disaster management system that records critical threats and available resources (such as personnel, equipment, support services) at village and national levels;

* An integrated rural milk procurement system that records milk collection to facilitate payments to farmers.

There are a growing number of telecentre network experiences with direct content and services development, although there is much potential that remains unexplored. Within the telecentre.org community, we can highlight the UgaBYTES initiative that a service called ‘MySchool’, which helps high school students in Uganda meet online to share educational resources and to ask teachers questions. The national network in Mozambique receives the collaboration of the Brazilian Telecentre Information and Business Association (ATN) to deliver online telecentre manager training. D.Net in Bangladesh provides another good references (see Box 3).

&lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #E0FFFF; border: solid 1px #00a5ff; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;center&gt;'''Box 6.1 An online portal of input services directory developed by telecentres in Bangladesh'''&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;[http://www.jeeon.com.bd/thikana www.jeeon.com.bd/thikana]:&lt;/center&gt;

D.Net, one of the members of the Bangladesh Telecentre Network, started to generate a countrywide directory of service providers like agriculture tool vendors, hospitals, educational institutions, and law firms; where information listed included their address, products available, price range, availability etc. They created an information repository of 20 sectors from 26 districts. Total entries in the database number over 8,000.

D.Net used telecentres to collect this data by surveying local businesses. They trained telecentre staff and gave them a questionnaire in order to collect data. The telecentres thereby collected the data and send it to D.Net via email. Through this process, telecentres were able to earn additional income, while getting the opportunity to introduce a new service to the community. For D.Net, this process reduced the cost of their operation (also because they used the same telecentres to help them upgrade or further modify the data collected.

&lt;/div&gt;

==== Attributes of Content and Services ====

The design and nature of content and services needs to be guided by the needs of telecentres, which in turn are determined by the needs – and perceived opportunities – of their communities. The particular mix of content and services useful for a telecentre depends on the community ecosystem, where the telecentre itself needs to become an important component of that ecosystem. The figure below describes the constituent parts of such a community ecosystem. Each of the bubbles represents people and organizations that have a concrete, staked interest. Telecentre managers and telecentre network staff need to ensure that everything provided by telecentres is focused on community needs and opportunities. This translates into a process where benefits reach a sufficient amount of ecosystem actors. 
This leads to the questions, what attributes should characterize those content and services activities demanded by local communities and channelled through individual telecentres? We can point out at least four necessary attributes: content and services that are appropriate, relevant, dynamic and authentic. 
Content and services may be determined as '''appropriate''' for a specific community or network based on any of the following potential benefits: 

* &lt;u&gt;Reducing costs&lt;/u&gt; by accessing different types of information and knowledge through easy and cheap communications;
* Creating &lt;u&gt;new income opportunities&lt;/u&gt; for the community, by helping community members to gain new ICT or information skills, or to learn about new productive or business possibilities;
* &lt;u&gt;Reducing the risk&lt;/u&gt; of possible loss or damage in a community, such as in disaster preparedness;
* &lt;u&gt;Empowering marginalized&lt;/u&gt; communities and giving a ‘voice to the voiceless’.

&lt;!-- ----------   Image ---------------- --&gt;
[[File:Figure 6.1 Community Ecosystem for Telecentres.jpg|thumb|400px|center|Figure 6.1 Community Ecosystem for Telecentres.jpg]]
&lt;!-- ----------   Image ---------------- --&gt;

Benefits may not always be quantifiable but they need to be visible. For instance, a cheap communications service (like IP telephony via companies like Skype) can let a mother know that her daughter and grandchildren are doing well far away from home. We have identified a few brief stories of social changes to illustrate, which are presented in Appendix 6.1.

Because appropriate content and services are determined by user needs, they need to be '''dynamic'''. Telecentre networks have to be prepared to adapt or even abandon services as needs change over time. In the case of a service that provides content (information) to farmers about pest control and management, if new pesticides emerge on the market or if specific pests arrive in the scene, the service will have to update its content, since erroneous information may prove to be very costly to the farmers.

The '''relevance''' of content and services determines their level of demand by the community. Proper packaging and delivery contribute to their relevance. Selecting the right delivery channels is critical in developing content and services; it may be necessary to use a combination of offline, online, print, SMS-based, or face-to-face channels. A network should also consider the characteristics of its telecentre users, such as their literacy levels. For instance, telecentre networks that work with high illiteracy rates will deliver more voice and video enabled content than printed materials. Content translation is also essential. The role of a good infomediary is not only to provide physical access to information but also to facilitate ‘real’ accessibility: that is, to make their meaning accessible.

Another important attribute of content and services is '''authenticity'''. Because of the potential impact of particular content and services to people’s livelihoods, it imperative that networks seek validation to ensure that the information provided is accurate, complete and can lead to effective results, and that entities who are providing informational services are legal and honest. It is also useful if respected thematic experts and organizations validate content and service activities. In fact, this validation or quality control function may be one of the added value tasks performed by telecentre networks.

==== Types of Content and services ====

Community demands for information and services may vary widely from one community to the next. For example, local demand for livelihood information and services depends on types of professions in the community. Demand may prove higher in rural and remote areas, given their isolation and more restrained access to information. A telecentre network can get involved by providing a potentially wide range of content and services, which can relate to any of the following areas: 

* '''Agriculture:''' Agriculture is the main occupation of people living in rural areas. Many people engaged with agriculture are illiterate or semi-literate. But they have inherited indigenous knowledge. Typical demands for content and services from farmers can include: where to buy quality seeds, insecticides, pesticides or fertilizer availability (particularly from government sources). They also want to know about power cuts, fuel prices and the visits of agriculture extension officers. Farmers are certainly interested about information on daily market prices for agricultural commodities, but also on tools to test the soil quality, storage facilities (particularly for perishable products) or information about crop rotation and selection. 

* '''Health:''' Health and healthcare related issues are basic to a community’s well being, especially for rural women. The information demands on health issues are mainly on basic remedial issues related to diseases and health problems. Telemedicine services, including remote diagnostics and treatment follow-up are particularly valuable for rural people who can save precious time and money by not having to travel far away for some of those medical services.

* '''Law and human rights:''' Violation of human rights may be more prevalent in rural locations because people lack basic education on their rights, or information about their obligations. Local elites often take advantage of the functional illiteracy of the individuals within the community. For these purposes, databases of legal and human rights organizations, listings for the nearest administrative offices and information about citizen rights are valuable. 

* '''Education:''' Students and teachers in rural communities often have little access to quality educational material. Youth in those areas may find it difficult to obtain higher education, so information about higher education opportunities, as well as procedures of getting admitted, is important for the rural community. Aging adult literacy is another major demand on the educational sector. Using audiovisual materials to promote adult literacy creates new opportunities for adult literacy as people can learn by watching and listening.

* '''Employment:''' People use several sources for job information. Personal, face-to-face contact is the most common source for employment information. In addition, telecentres facilitate access to job information via online services. 

* '''Commerce, business including self-employment/non-farm economic activities:''' Telecentres can become popular places for business and commerce. Using a telecentre, people can find out information about their products (including market prices and additional information), input pricing and connections to global and national trading opportunities. Self-employment, especially rural micro and small enterprises capture the majority of rural occupations. Information about new business opportunities, business-related government information, business management, and online market places are major demands for this sector. 

* '''Disaster preparedness and management:''' Disasters and natural calamities are an increasing occurrence across the globe. Access to disaster-related information can reduce the severity of its effects, such as by allowing people a timely evacuation before a probable disaster strikes. 

* '''Government service:''' Telecentres can be a popular mechanism and a primary access point for all e-government services. This can make it easier to download official forms, submissions, certifications and so on, cutting out ‘middle men’ who sometimes demand unwarranted fees to perform services for citizens. 

* '''Entertainment:''' Telecentres are good source of entertainment for rural communities. Satellite private televisions and radio broadcasted programs are usually not available in rural areas. Telecentres may therefore provide good venues for entertainment: cartoons for children, drama shows, movies, sports for adults or online radio stations, are good examples.

* '''News:''' In many remote villages, access to the newspaper is absent. Currently, most newspapers have an online version and there are hundreds of news blogs. A telecentre is a common access point for all to access to this media online. 

A key service provide by telecentres is '''access to the internet''', used by relatively more highly educated and ICT-knowledgeable user groups for purposes as wide-ranging as (i) job searching, (ii) applying for foreign visas, (iii) learning materials, (iv) reading the newspaper (and writing to the editor), (v) writing and conferencing with relatives, (vi) exchanging business information, or (vii) simply playing games. Some users, mostly in urban areas, are more advanced; they may use ICT facilities for banking or e-commerce activities. Many telecentres also provide ICT training.

'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;Box 6.2: Telecentres of Business and Information (TBI), Brazil &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

The ‘Telecentres of Business and Information’ program is different from other digital inclusion programs in that it is more socially oriented: it aims to provide spaces for conducting business activities. The program’s objective is to strengthen competitiveness, increase profitability and reduce the closure of micro and small businesses by providing access to information, products, services and training courses available on the internet and on the resources offered by ICTs. That is, '''literacy and digital inclusion were taken as a ‘means’ (as a stage of work), and not its purpose'''. The program started in 2000, and now in 2009 it is in its third program phase.

A Telecentre of Business and Information is a physical space within an existing institution that represents and develops actions directed towards micro and small businesses. Their infrastructure is built on the computational and human resources necessary for digital literacy and on the use of extensive resources of the internet. Each TBI has a manager, with some monitors and assistants, and about 10 computers connected in a local network and to the internet. Other equipment is also available, such as printers, scanners, a fax machine, telephone, or television. By the end of 2008, the TBI network included an impressive 3,500 units.

The key resource for providing business content is the TBI Portal that introduced ‘smart navigation’ for the classification and presentation of business information. The actions of the program’s Information Committee in organizing topics of interest for micro and small businesses, and the establishment of virtual communities were very important in terms of facilitating content provision.

The TBI Network now offers extension courses in Telecentre Management and Digital Entrepreneurship in the form of e-learning offered via a Moodle platform. The courses were developed specifically to train telecentre managers, for a total of 60 hours and with the support of specialist tutors. The content is available in five modules, with the intention to stimulate entrepreneurial potential and improve telecentre management practices. At the end of the course, students receive a certificate from the University of Brasilia. Since 2007, the course has trained more than 300 telecentre managers.

A management system of Telecentres of Business and Information has been set up for the TBI Network, to facilitate monitoring and evaluation. It is focused mainly on two functions: 1) to generate indicators for the TBI network and 2) to automate internal administrative activities of the telecentres. Even though it is still in development, the management system is already being used by 125 TBIs in the country.

Project TBI has benefited from the collaboration of an extensive set of partners, for a variety of purposes, including for: (i) internet connection, (ii) the donation of computers, furniture, printers, modems, fax, scanners or air conditioners, and (iii) for courses and training for professionals. Key partnerships were established with Caixa Econômica Federal and Banco do Brasil (two large banks) for the donation of computers; the &lt;u&gt;National Research Council&lt;/u&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Which is similar in function to the National Science Foundation in the United States, or other similar national science and research bodies.&lt;/ref&gt;for providing technical expertise for the project, and the &lt;u&gt;Brazilian Service of Support to Micro and Small Enterprises&lt;/u&gt;, for the installation of telecentres and an ongoing discussion on methodologies and strategic planning. &lt;ref&gt; There were nearly 100 sponsoring and supporting organizations mentioned, most of them private companies, and a lesser number of universities and public (Brazilian) companies.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the TBI program received a World Summit Award in the category digital inclusion (e-inclusion). This award is sponsored by UNIDO, UNESCO and the Internet Society.
&lt;/div&gt;

===  Case study - Mapping content for telecentres by the Bangladesh Telecentre Network &lt;ref&gt;For more information, see the following web page:[http://www.mission2011.net.bd/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=76&amp;Itemid=101&amp;lang=en www.mission2011.net.bd/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=76&amp;Itemid=101&amp;lang=en]&lt;/ref&gt;===

It is important for a telecentre network to invest in finding different sources of content and services and developing partnerships with various organizations to link them with telecentres. Recently, the Bangladesh Telecentre Network (BTN) has undertaken an initiative to map content and services for telecentres. The BTN found that individual telecentres do not know who has what. Instead, they struggle to find relevant sources of content and services. 

The Bangladesh Telecentre Network put together a small team comprised of a number of members with experience in content and services development for telecentres. At the beginning, BTN called for a members meeting and shared the idea of '''content mapping'''. The members attending the meeting identified dynamic sectors where they had demand for content by the community. The sectors are: 

{|style=&quot;background:#cccccc;&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;

After finalizing the list of sectors, the team discussed how the various ways in which to present these types of content. Before starting the content mapping process, the team identified the following types of format:

After developing a comprehensive matrix (See Appendix 6.3 for a detailed matrix template), the team developed a list of institutions with the potential to develop content in each of the sectors mentioned above.

The team later organized small sectoral meetings with organizations to brief them about the importance of content mapping and its benefit to the community. After the discussion, many organizations showed their willingness to support the initiative.

In the very first phase the Bangladesh Telecentre Network technical team helped the organizations to develop their content description and post it on the BTN website. Later, a small number of organizations started posting their information on their own.

As a result, BTN was able to develop a repository of 1,130 knowledge sources that are grouped under 13 categories. The outcomes were aggregated numerically as follows:

This example of content mapping can be replicated in other telecentre networks, yet it is also important to recognize the associated challenges. Among them are limitations drawing from copyrights of the institutions and authors, the capacity of organizations to post online and, most importantly, the level of &lt;u&gt;willingness to support a network&lt;/u&gt;.

=== Quick tips about Content and services===

* Telecentre networks should regularly and systematically examine the needs of individual telecentres for content and services, in order to provide a collective expression of demand – known as a pull strategy. 

* A telecentre network should deliberately promote content and services from different providers when it believes that they will be useful to some telecentres – a push strategy. 

* Telecentre networks can help individual telecentres to assess the needs for content and services for their community – through methodology, advice, tools, etc. 

* Community trust of content is important. Sometimes the organizations that are providing content are more important that the content itself. For example, medical content from an untrustworthy source may not be accepted by the community. 

* Telecentres are now a key source of research data about local communities, and TCNs can help to channel that data in ways that benefit telecentres (for example, through data on connectivity in order to increase coverage).

* Government sources of information tend to be trusted. TCNs should try to bring more government institutions on board, for example, to provide e-government services.

* Telecentres by themselves often do not know where to access relevant content and services, so telecentre networks can be of great help to locate them. Rigorous content mapping is an important function of the network from an early stage.

* Various communication channels should be used to provide content and services: including offline, online, face-to-face, and print media. 

* Some users may be illiterate, which should be taken into account (therefore more audio and video content is helpful).

* Some of the content and services may not be strictly developmental in nature, like in entertainment and news, but there will nevertheless be an audience for it. 

* The increased versatility of mobile phones may add ‘mobility’ and higher personal access to the information. 

* Telecentre networks will have an increasingly relevant function in providing exchange platforms for direct access or provision of content and services among users; that is, a kind of peer-to-peer marketplace for content and services.

The Jeeon- IKB (Information and Knowledge Base) is a content database that has been developed in Bangla and is aimed at improving livelihood through ICTs. This CD version has been made for use in locations that do not have internet connectivity. The Jeeon-IKB responds to everyday queries such as what, where, who, and how in the areas of agriculture, education, healthcare, non-farming economic activities, appropriate technologies, human rights, awareness and disaster management in simple non-technical language. The Jeeon-IKB is particularly suitable for rural users – even for those who are unable to read and write, with the assistance of 'infomediaries' (people who can use Jeeon-IKB to respond to queries). This also creates access to crucial information and thus reduces livelihood costs and improves income opportunities. The Jeeon-IKB is more effective when used with Teletathya: the people's telecentre (a mobile phone based information service), since whatever information is not available in the CD can be obtained by calling the specialists at the Teletathya Helpline.

The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) Rice Knowledge Bank (RKB) is the central repository for all IRRI’s research-based rice science and rice farming knowledge that is relevant to the extension-farmer community. The IRRI RKB is also the model for similar RKBs in each partner country where the individual countries select, validate and modify rice-farming knowledge for their extension/farmer communities. The strength of the RKB community depends on developing a shared vision for the RKBs, a sharing of knowledge and exchanging information about technical issues. Now, different countries have their local language version of the knowledge base. For example, in Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute has developed a comprehensive agriculture knowledge bank in Bangla, which is available at [http://knowledgebank-brri.org www.knowledgebank-brri.org].

CellBazaar is a service from Grameen Phone that allows the people to buy or sell via mobile phones in Bangladesh. If anybody wants to sell something, they can post the information on CellBazaar through Grameen Phone, and buyers can contact them. If someone is looking for something to buy, or if they need a particular service (such as a tutor), they can look for it on CellBazaar and contact the seller directly. When a buyer sees an item that they like, they can call the seller, get additional information, and meet the seller to complete the transaction. CellBazaar is a platform for buyers and sellers to find each other. People can access CellBazaar by calling to a special short code number, sending SMS, using WAP or even online.

One Village One Portal (OVOP) is an initiative of GCC (Global Communication Center) aims to build a model of social information infrastructure where villagers can also be producers and owners of village information. Rather than using high-tech infrastructure and training, this model shows how villagers with their current skill set and their own devices can generate and broadcast information. In order to bridge the gap between their capability and the capability of their devices, a &quot;bottom of the pyramid” (BoP) adaptation layer is introduced in the model. Villagers need ICTs to spread their voices. Indeed it can be argued that we need their voices as much as they do. Our step towards finding a way for villagers to develop, own and commoditize information is the One Village One Portal platform. The platform is capable of handling 85,000 portals for 85,000 villages in Bangladesh. However, we envision the OVOP as a prototype for other BoP villages around the world.

&lt;center&gt;Website:  [http://proinfo.mec.gov.br proinfo.mec.gov.br]&lt;/center&gt;

One promising field for telecentre services via the support of telecentre networks is in formal and vocational education. One successful example of a program of excellence in education instrumented largely through telecentres is the National Program of Informatics in Education, an initiative of the Ministry of Education in Brazil. The approach has been to incorporate telecentres within Brazilian schools with the objective of improving education, and with the added value of benefiting their communities beyond students and education professionals.

| '''A Farmer Saved his Crop using Information Services of Telecentre''' 
Mr. Nurul Islam Khan produces rice along with beans, bitters and bottle gourds on his land. He is doing his best to make an honest living for his six-member family with an average monthly family income of USD $120. One day, he found that his cultivated beans, bitters and bottle gourds were attacked by harmful insects. He became worried and started consulting with his neighbours.
His neighbours advised him to consult with a local agricultural field officer regarded as ‘block supervisor’, a post of Agricultural Extension Department under the Ministry of Agriculture. They also informed him that if he fails to get hold of the desired officer, then he can pay a visit to local telecentre to receive effective agricultural information services through various ICT channels. The urgency to receive effective agricultural advice made him look for the local block supervisor first, but he failed to get hold of him. Then he sought informational help from telecentre. He paid a visit to the telecentre and he chose to use the verbal information service from the CD content. 
Mr. Nurul Islam Khan applied the prescribed insecticides and dramatically got rid of his problems. Thus he saved his beans, bitters and bottle gourds and above all, his livelihood. According to his calculation, Mr. Nurul Islam Khan was able to prevent a total loss of USD $120 just by applying the received advice without paying any charge for the service offered by the Pallitathya Kendra. He thinks that information services provided by the Pallitathya Kendra can greatly save other farmers from potential losses.

Alam, a 26-year old rural educated youth never even dreamt of getting a job at a local bank. The place where he stays is far from the main town, so it is hard for him to search for new employment opportunities. Fortunately, a local telecentre came forward to rescue him from this situation. 
Alam knew about internet browsing from the infomediary at the local telecentre. Browsing the internet at a local telecentre, he found a job advertisement in a local bank. He applied for the position through email. He was shortlisted and later interviewed. The bank authority publishes results online. Alam, thanks to the local telecentre, could get the dreamed result online. Now Mr. Alam is working as a Customer Relations Officer at BRAC Bank Ltd., Khatungonj, at the Chittagong Branch.

| '''Phone call saved scores of Indian villagers from tsunami'''
The tsunami that struck the coastal communities of several Asian countries on 26 December, 2004, was made even more tragic as news began to break of how a handful of technicians, monitoring the progress of the waves across the seas using the latest ICT systems, found themselves unable to warn communities standing in harm's way.
This was not the case with Vijayakumar Gunasekaran, a 27-year old son of a fisherman from Nallavadu village, Pondicherry, on the eastern coast of India, who works in Singapore. He had access to radio and television broadcasters on the morning of 26 December. Vijayakumar followed the news of the earthquake in Aceh, Indonesia as it unfolded over the radio and television in Singapore. As the seriousness of the disaster in Aceh sank in, he began to worry about the safety of his family living along the Indian coastline facing Aceh. He decided to phone home.
Muphazhaqi, his sister answered the phone. She told him that seawater was seeping into their home when he asked what was happening in Nallavadu. Vijayakumar realized at once that his worst fears were rapidly materializing. He asked his sister to quickly leave their home and to also warn other villagers to evacuate the village. &quot;Run out and shout the warning to others&quot; he urged his sister.
Her warning reached a couple of quick-thinking villagers who suddenly went to the telecentre where a public address system used routinely to announce sea conditions to the fishermen was housed. The warning from Vijayakumar, corroborated by a second overseas telephone call from Gopu, another villager working abroad, was broadcasted across the village using the telecentre’s loudspeaker. The village siren, which was available at the telecentre, was sounded immediately afterwards for the people to evacuate.
No one from the village was killed as a result of the timely warnings. Nallavadu is home to 500 families and about 3,630 people. While all lives were saved, the tsunami destroyed 150 houses and 200 fishing boats in the village.

| '''Khadija is back to her normal life with dignity'''
Khadija Begam was married to Alamin Akon (a 28 year-old man), both from Mongla. Her husband got married for a second time without informing her. Khadija could not tolerate it and protested. That caused her to be physically and mentally abused by her husband. She had no choice but to move to her parents’ house with her three-year-old daughter. She was helpless. Mr. Akon refused to pay any alimony to his wife. 
She knew about a mobile infomediary, who was working in a community telecentre, and called her one day. The mobile infomediary Nayan helped her to talk to a lawyer from a local human rights organization whose address and details was available at the telecentre where Nayan was working. After investigating the problem and consulting with Khadija, the lawyer sent a legal notice to her husband. After receiving the legal notice from the court, her husband got scared and rushed to the Union Parishad Chairman for a petition to compromise. But the UP chairman didn’t respond to it, since the local telecentre routinely informs community citizens about their rights and obligations. The chairman told Ms. Khadija that if she withdraws the legal notice, he would take her back to his family. But Ms. Khadija was adamant and she wanted either a compensation of BDT 25,000 or a divorce between her husband and his second wife. She managed to find a job at a restaurant in Mongla to make an honest living with dignity. She found the telecentre to be as a good resort while in distress and relied on it later for other livelihood issues.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Aminata Maiga (AFRIKLINKS, Mali)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This chapter identifies resource challenges, business models for telecentre networks and discusses ways for networks to undertake resource mobilization programs. Since the first telecentres were established in the early 1980s, a number of different models have emerged around the world. The models often take varied management approaches, technologies, connectivity options, and services. Yet no single telecentre model has so far proved inherently superior in terms of ensuring financial sustainability. Issues underlying financial sustainability of telecentre networks have been mostly similar to those of the network members – i.e. the telecentres themselves. The difference however, is that as a network, there is more potential for finding working solutions.
=== The Financial Picture for Telecentre Networks===
The telecentres of today and of the future are increasingly networked telecentres. The impact of telecentre networks has been significant in terms of providing quality support to telecentres, strengthening their mission of delivering ICT training and services to rural and marginalised urban communities, and in bridging the digital divide (or specific digital divides, such as urban-rural). 

Telecentre networks function well if they have a heart – a core team of people – that champion the exchange of ideas, propose projects, ensure lessons are documented, make connections with potential partners and oversee long-term planning. It does not matter whether a network is virtual or physical. But there is only so much that a core team can do if it does not have the financial resources needed for the tasks at hand. Ultimately, a lack of resources often results in frustration and undermines the spirit of the network. In fact, the collapse of many telecentre networks has been attributed to lack of financial resources.

Before entering into the relevant aspects of financial sustainability for telecentre networks, we will start by quickly identifying other dimensions of TCN sustainability, besides the financial one, which have an effect on overall sustainability. The remainder of the chapter focuses on financial sustainability: 

*'''Social sustainability''' – This may be the most influential dimension of the various types of sustainability, since it is driven by demand of its members&lt;ref&gt; The sustainability of telecentres is highly dependent on their ability to offer the right mix of products and services. The types of services that telecentres provide is rapidly evolving, as the areas of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGovernment eGovernment], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EHealth eHealth], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Learning e-Learning], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECommerce eCommerce] advance. Telecentres and TCNs need to take advantage of opportunities to extend the benefits to the community at large, through their public access and geographical coverage. Some governments are pursuing the deployment of telecentres programs precisely as a means of ensuring that larger segments of the population are able to access government services and information through electronic channels.&lt;/ref&gt;. As Fillip and Foote say “sustaining a network is first and foremost about providing value to the telecentre managers who belong” (2007, p. 151). 
*'''Institutional Sustainability''' – It is beneficial to increase the scale of telecentre networks through partnerships with other telecentres, and with sectors including government, the private sector, academia, and civil society. By involving an extended set of organizations, responsibilities and costs are shared, collective commitment is increased, and risks are reduced. 
*'''Technological sustainability''' – Telecentre networks require good access to the proper technologies and skilled technicians needed to provide adequate services to the member telecentres.

&lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #E0FFFF; border: solid 1px #00a5ff; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;center&gt;'''Box 5.1 Achieving institutional sustainability: the Brazil Community program'''&lt;/center&gt;

The project Brazil Community ([http://www.ec-corp.com.br/midia/2002/nov/cam_comunidade.htm www.ec-corp.com.br/midia/2002/nov/cam_comunidade.htm]) was created in 2002 with the purpose of creating so-called ‘Community Rooms’ that have internet access in the whole country. It put in motion an interesting public-private partnership model in telecentre-related initiatives.

The partnerships model was based on a union between the Brazilian government, civil society organizations and the business sector. In so doing, it gained the commitment of a diverse set of partners, each with different contributions and responsibilities:

* Intel ([http://www.intel.com www.intel.com]) donated equipment for the telecentre;
* Microsoft([http://www.microsoft.com www.microsoft.com]) provided licensed software;
* Web-Class ([http://www.webaula.com.br www.webaula.com.br]) offered the technology for a distance education program;
* Planner ([http://www.plannermob.com.br www.plannermob.com.br]) provided Marketing Intelligence Service tools;
* Caixa Econômica Federal (CEF) ([http://www.caixa.gov.br/ www.caixa.gov.br]) provided some of the funding;
* The Federal Data Processing Service (SERPRO) ([http://www.serpro.gov.br www.serpro.gov.br]), committed to giving technological support to telecentres;
* Câmara Brasileira de Comércio Eletrônico ([http://www.camara-e.net/ www.camara-e.net]) provided a little funding and e-commerce technology;
* An e-consulting business ([http://www.ec-corp.com.br www.ec-corp.com.br])created the web portal www.comunidade-brasil.net;
* The NGO Moradia e Cidadania ([http://www.moradiaecidadania.org.br www.moradiaecidadania.org.br]), supported local workers;
* The NGO Sampa.org ([http://www.sampa.org www.sampa.org]), provided telecentre management training; and
* Brasil Telecom ([http://www.brasiltelecom.com.br www.brasiltelecom.com.br]) offered free internet access.
&lt;/div&gt;

==== Financial challenges for telecentre networks ====

Telecentre networks face various types of challenges while trying to achieve financial sustainability, as listed below:

* &lt;u&gt;Low financial diversification&lt;/u&gt;: Many telecentres and telecentre networks, in their initial stages, are funded 100% by donors, and later experience a reduction in this funding. This generates a high level of risk if key donors withdraw their support.

* &lt;u&gt;Restrictions on the use of funding&lt;/u&gt;: Some grants include restrictions that inhibit a telecentre network’s ability to grow and develop independently. That is, some grants may only be provided to carry out specific activities or hire particular staff for the duration of a project. Moreover, there are usually no provisions for subsequent funding. It is important to limit expectations to the explicit terms of an agreement. 

* &lt;u&gt;Lack of funding for non-project work&lt;/u&gt;: It is often hard to secure funding for advocacy and institutional strengthening activities. For example, in many countries, the benefits that telecentres and ICT4D activities may bring to communities need to be more widely and publicly communicated, since these tasks figure under ‘soft’ operations, and are therefore hard to finance outright. 

* &lt;u&gt;Proposal-related hassle&lt;/u&gt;: There are often difficulties related to the preparation and presentation or follow-up of funding proposals. Each donor organization requires the submission of proposals in a particular format; and naturally, each donor targets specific interests. In this way, the preparation of multiple proposals often becomes too time consuming for TCNs with limited capacity (with respect to technical and human resources). 

* &lt;u&gt;Project-only funding&lt;/u&gt;: Funds are often limited to short-term projects that are financed by a handful of donors (such as national governments and international agencies), compared to a lack of funding for projects supporting overall organizational development or projects with a broader social impact.

Bearing these challenges in mind, it must also be understood that if many telecentres in a network are not sustainable themselves, then it is difficult for the network to be sustainable as a whole. Therefore, apart from supporing telecentres individually, telecentre networks also have a vested interest in contributing to their financial stability.

==== Planning for financial sustainability ====

Effective financial sustainability starts with a clear strategic plan: a long-term perspective of what the network is about and what it plans to do. This strategy should outline network objectives, priorities, resources required, and a means to track performance and resource levels. Each of these aspects is discussed in detail in other chapters of this guidebook, where this chapter focuses mainly on locating resources for the implementation stage of a telecentre network. 

A telecentre network strategic plan may include obtaining resources from internal and external sources. &lt;u&gt;Internal financial resources&lt;/u&gt; may include:

* '''Membership fees''' – Who pays, and how much, are questions that should be carefully thought out. Collecting membership fees requires transparency, accountability and ample reporting on the part of the network leadership. Otherwise, fees can become a source of network instability. 

* '''Consultancy services''' – Networks can provide technical services for a fee to their telecentre members, governments, private or civil society organizations. In several countries around the world, telecentre networks are leaders in universal access issues and enjoy good access to communities, which makes them valuable project partners. For instance, UgaBYTES in Uganda provides technical maintenance support to telecentres at a discounted fee.
 
* '''Sale of products''' – This may include discounted software, hardware, training programs or telecentre supplies. Products that are connected to the core business of a telecentre network may be the most feasible to sell since they may not require the development of new skills.

&lt;center&gt;'''Box 5.2 Growing the market for telecentres: Cooking school (and other services)'''&lt;/center&gt;

''“I had a chat with Mohamed (Afriklinks) yesterday – kind of trying to digest the focus of eight telecentres that were launched early this month by government of Algeria which provides 100% support. This program is supported by InWent (Germany). They visited a telecentre in Djelfa, Algeria almost 300 km from the capital.''

''The catch for me, these telecentres provide certified training in cookery and adult literacy in addition to your usual telecentre style services. I think that is really revolutionary. This is why; if rural communities where most telecentres are located are largely illiterate and therefore unable to effectively use most services, how will a telecentre helps to address that problem and therefore drive more use?''

''You have probably heard of telecoms and other private companies spending time and energy to grow the market…working with young people and investing in schools (tomorrow’s market). How can a telecentre grow its future market? &lt;u&gt;Well, adult literacy training is one great way to do just that&lt;/u&gt;”.''

&lt;/div&gt;

==== Resource mobilization from external sources====

There are many resource mobilization opportunities from &lt;u&gt;external network sources&lt;/u&gt;. Perhaps this is an area within which telecentre networks have focused significantly, but still not enough. The foundation of a good external resources mobilization plan is based on a strong awareness of what a network can do well, knowledge of its internal capacities (to offer as services to other organizations) and a recognition of the organizations that might be interested in working with the network. This implies an objective partnership analysis, and one that requires regular updates.

One way for telecentre networks to raise external resources is to directly cover '''operational overheads'''. This may mean getting another organization to pay for the salary of key network staff member(s) or paying for the internet connectivity. The network, in this instance, does not have to receive the money directly.

Telecentre networks can also mobilize external resources through '''endorsements'''. When a network can demonstrate its network value in terms of quantity, it is possible to use it to endorse products and services in return for economic value. Some telecentre networks such as the [http://www.atn.org.br Brazilian Telecentre Information and Business Association] (ATN)&lt;ref&gt;The website can be found at: [http://www.atn.org.br/ www.atn.org.br]&lt;/ref&gt; have developed a highly regarded public reputation so that private sector companies and local governments may even provide funding just in order to be associated with the network brand. Clearly, network value can be highly valuable if it is properly communicated and marketed.

One of the most significant ways to generate resources externally is for a telecentre network to act as a '''distribution channel''' of content and services. This implies working with private sector companies, civil society organizations and governments to distribute, implement, test and demonstrate products or services. TCNs can obtain significant resources this way. It gives networks an opportunity to expand the range of products and services they offer beyond the traditional ICT-related ones. And it places TCNs as significant actors in public-private partnerships.

Telecentre networks with the capacity and processes in place to act as distribution channels can work together with international partners such as UN agencies, multinational corporations with corporate social responsibility programs and universities. They can work either from the &lt;u&gt;demand side&lt;/u&gt;, such as bringing online university courses to telecentre users. And they could also work the &lt;u&gt;supply-side&lt;/u&gt;, such as offering project collaboration opportunities for a UN agency at the telecentre/community level. For instance, the partnership between the [http://www.atn.org.br/ Brazilian Telecentre Information and Business Association] (ATN) and Microsoft will provide 40,000 Windows XP/Office Package licenses for telecentres. Another benefit from this partnership is the email service hosted and operated by Microsoft in the platform Windows Live Custom Domains.

ATN provides another interesting example of helping telecentres’ financial needs with respect to university education. Through a partnership with the Metropolitan University of Santos (Unimes), telecentres are able to offer graduate and post-graduate courses accredited by Brazil’s Ministry of Education. Through this program, students attend classes once a week in the telecentres which are given by teachers from the university. Throughout the week, students can use any computer and other telecentre services they may need. By the end of the course, students receive an accredited degree while the telecentre receives 20% of each student’s monthly payment.

Perhaps the most frequent approach taken presently by telecentre networks is to raise external funds is via '''direct project funding'''. However, this is also the most unreliable of all sources. External funding may come from national or foreign donors. It is common for industrialized countries such as Canada, Finland, Australia or Spain to provide telecentre services for free to individual users in their territory. The Government of Western Australia, for example, gives recurrent support to most of an estimated 150 telecentres via its well-established WA Telecentre Network &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlgrd.wa.gov.au/RegionDev/Telecentres.asp www.dlgrd.wa.gov.au/RegionDev/Telecentres.asp]&lt;/ref&gt; and makes use of the distributed potential discussed in the previous section to provide a range of educational and government services to the local communities served. This implies that the Western Australia Government considers its financial support to be an investment and not a simple ‘donation’.

Less developed countries that try to follow this type of highly subsidized project funding for telecentre development may find it to be financially unsustainable. It may lead to an abrupt stop in funding, or limit the extent and reach of telecentre programming. But this makes an even stronger selling point for supporting telecentre networks: if, as a government, you cannot maintain individual telecentres, at least try to strongly support telecentre networks that will work to stabilize the situation of the individual telecentres.

In the Philippines and Brazil, as in Australia and Spain, some telecentre networks are run by government organizations where workers and operational fees are paid for by the government. In Mali, the government wants to establish telecentres called ‘Community Access Points’ (CAPs) in all 703 communes, and to provide support for them (at least initially). The existing telecentre network in Mali, called FETEMA, is lobbying the government to demonstrate the advantages of networking and to send the message that FETEMA has the required expertise to support telecentres – and can probably do it more effectively and efficiently than government officials with lesser expertise and who are busy with other issues. This is a proper way to seek official support for a telecentre network, in promoting a partnership with a government department.

====  Social enterprises and telecentre networks ====

Telecentre networks can turn to the ‘social enterprise’ concept for effectively and efficiently complying with its essentially social objective (i.e. to support its member telecentres), as a logical extension of the social enterprise models exhibited by individual telecentres. This model can be applied to income-generating activities to supplement existing program funding and individual telecentre contributions. 

The term ‘social enterprise’ refers to any entrepreneurial activity that generates revenue for an organization (that is, the ‘enterprise’) while at the same time helping to achieve social objectives. A network that ‘sells’ market information to telecentres to strengthen their services in the community and allows them to generate revenues is operating as a social enterprise. A different example could relate to a national NGO that wishes to disseminate good practices and training about family planning but that finds it difficult to reach municipal areas - the national telecentre network could then negotiate a fee with the NGO to send the relevant content to its telecentres, and thus provide the information to the NGO’s target audience in effective manner. 

A social enterprise model for a telecentre network can bring a series of potential benefits such as:
* Increased and diversified income resulting from a social enterprise’s ‘profitability’, which helps to reduce dependence on uncertain funding sources; 

* Greater flexibility because, unlike grant funding, a social enterprise’s income is not restricted to a specific use, thereby allowing networks to use the funds in ways that best meet their organizational needs;

* Improved overall organizational performance as the proper financial and managerial discipline required for running a successful social enterprise will improve the network’s organizational efficiency and planning skills;

* A positive impression on donors as they may appreciate that the telecentre network is being proactive in generating its own resources;

* Increased visibility and network self-confidence: marketing for social enterprise purposes can reach new audiences for the network, making the same the network leaders and staff realise that they have the ability to generate income on their own. 

A telecentre network can manage more than one social enterprise, depending on its size (or, to be more precise, its management capacity). It also depends on the level of demand from telecentres or other clients (such as government entities or businesses) for delivering value-added services such as health content, tax information, delivery of official forms, and so on. 
While social enterprise models may bring significant benefits for telecentre networks, network managers should be aware of potential limitations. Managing a social enterprise of any type is not easy, and it may run against local economic or business cultures. Social enterprises also require a certain level of financial stability and expertise that not all telecentre networks have, and therefore they must be professionally managed. Furthermore, there is no direct recipe for success. Rather, each social enterprise model should be tailored to each particular telecentre network’s mission, and level of capacity, expertise, and technical skills. 

According to Loïc Comolli, a social enterprise is not a way to get ‘quick money’ because it requires a long-term financial strategy and it may take several years before a financial return is realised (2008). In addition, as with any kind of business, a social enterprise is vulnerable to socio-economic conditions and market fluctuations, and if it not well managed it can place the network’s reputation and financial integrity at risk. A social enterprise’s activities may also cause a variety of internal organizational and cultural dilemmas as well as ideological conflicts with the core mission of the TCN.

==== Types of social enterprise models for telecentre networks ====

There is a range of possible social enterprise elements or activities that can be appropriate for telecentre networks. Some are closely related to the network's mission to strengthen telecentres, while others may be unrelated to the network's core missions and thus have a more limited – or even nonexistent – direct social impact. We take a look now at some of the various types, with tendencies ranging from lower to higher profit generation. 

What will emerge from this quick examination of social enterprise aspects in telecentre networks is an apparent trade-off between network mission impact and impending profit levels. In general, the less related the social enterprise is from the telecentre network mission, the lower the resulting ‘impact’ of the activities in achieving network goals, but the higher the expected profit. Working on activities unrelated to the network mission may prove risky to the TCN, because the market and product is less familiar. In any case, the primary goal of non-mission related social enterprises would be to generate enough revenues to either cover operational costs (what is commonly referred to as 'overhead') of the telecentre network and/or support specific projects. 

* &lt;u&gt;Implementing telecentre network program activities and providing services specified in the telecentre network’s charter without charging any fees from members&lt;/u&gt;: For example, a TCN may provide IT support to telecentres which strengthens a telecentre’s capacities, but additional funding is still required from other sources to pay staff members. The social impact of this kind of activity is high (telecentres cannot operate without staff) but the network relies 100% on grants and subsidies. Generally this kind of telecentre network is not seen as a social enterprise but rather as a type of NGO unless they use their social enterprise label to access funding as a regular component of their income generation strategy.

* &lt;u&gt;Using a partial cost-recovery goal, covering a percentage of their existing program costs through fees&lt;/u&gt;. This implies that the remaining costs would have to be covered by grants or donations. For example, the TCN may charge fees for providing IT support to telecentres. This helps to increase the prospects of sustainability of the program by reducing the amount of grant funding needed. 

* &lt;u&gt;Offering new services to existing clients (such as telecentres)&lt;/u&gt;. For example, they can sell ICT course curriculum to telecentres to offer higher quality training to community members. This type of social enterprise has a high mission impact, i.e. it aims at the core purpose of the organization, its mission, and is funded by cost-recovery. It can either allow for these tasks to be performed on a break-even basis or may even have a potential to create a financial profit.

* &lt;u&gt;Offering extended program activities to new paying clients&lt;/u&gt;. For example, a telecentre network may charge fees for IT support for local schools or NGOs for a small profit. 

* &lt;u&gt;Providing completely new products or services to new paying clients&lt;/u&gt;. For example, a telecentre network social enterprise that sells refurbished PCs to non-profit organizations and to the general public is not directly related to the network missiong since it does not directly involve the strengthening of telecentres; not in the service delivery, nor in the sharing of revenues from the enterprise. The overall goal is to make a profit that subsidizes the telecentre network's core activities and organizational development.

Since telecentre networks support and interact with a large number of telecentres (sometimes numbering in the hundreds or even thousands), the type of social enterprise that strikes a better balance may be one that provides new product or services to the existing clients (that is, member telecentres). At any rate, a rigorous analysis of TCN objectives, telecentre needs, revenue streams and resource mobilization possibilities is always required. The most appealing scenario, in most cases, is one where both networks and telecentres generate some revenue, offering products and services that are useful to the communities. 

The Rural Center of Digital Inclusion (CRID) ([http://www.multimeios.ufc.br www.multimeios.ufc.br]) based at the Federal University of Clara ([http://www.ufc.br www.ufc.br]) presents an interesting example of a social enterprise within a telecentre network. A project they run helps to mobilize the community to become acquainted with the process of digital culture, as a road towards ‘knowledge transformations’. As stakeholders in a public-private partnership scheme, the project involves rural communities in managing the telecentres, which offer services in digital inclusion, educational informatics, distance courses and telecommunications in a context of social, personal, economic and cultural empowerment. The telecentres are well-managed, the communities are empowered, and useful services are provided to the users of the telecentres.

=== Case Study - A Project Partnership with Malian Telecentres ===

'''“Building the capacities of young girls/women who are school drop-outs through Malian Telecentres: A partnership between Afriklinks, Microsoft CTSP and FETEMA”'''

====Background ====

Telecentres in Mali do not typically receive subsidies from initial funding partners to support operating costs. Among the various types of telecentres that exist, only those known as Community Learning and Information Centers (or Clicks) ever received direct subsidies, which ended in March 2005. The role of Afriklinks and its partners is to support these individual telecentres to achieve a higher level of sustainability (including within the network itself). 

With the support of telecentre.org, in addition to technical support from Afriklinks, the Federation des Telecentres du Mali (FETEMA) was created in 2006. However, FETEMA needed additional funds to become operational as an independent entity. Most of its funding was originally supposed to come from network members. But annual subscription fees were not allowed to cover network activities, and Afriklinks’ staff in Bamako constituted the de-facto permanent secretariat of FETEMA, essentially providing free human resources for the federation. In order to mobilize resources, therefore, FETEMA carried out many formal and informal meetings with potential partners. This case study is the result of one of those meetings.

==== The project ====

This project process started in Benin during the African Telecentre Leaders’ Forum that was held at Centre Songhai, in December 2007, where the Afriklinks team met with Microsoft representatives. We learned that Microsoft can fund community based ICT projects, and we knew that the person dedicated to Mali-based projects was based in Senegal.  After initial contact, we learned about the eligible areas for project funding at the community level, through Microsoft’s Community Technology Skills Program (CTSP) initiative. 

In Mali, many young girls drop out of school because they marry or have children at a young age. The majority of these girls do not have access to any ‘professional’ training of any kind, due to their poverty level, or for cultural reasons (for example, their husbands are not willing to pay to send them to another locality in order to attend courses). These young women therefore stay home to take care of domestic chores, and have little to aspire to besides raising a family. 

There emerged an opportunity to develop a project to provide these young women with ICT skills. The project covered their training fees, which in turn could help them make a new start. They were given the chance to improve their lives (if allowed the possibility to apply for jobs or manage a personal activity at the local level), while having access to useful information in telecentres which enabled them to better care for themselves and their families.

==== How it was designed ====

We submitted a proposal online at the Microsoft Unlimited potential website in June 2007. Two months later, we received an invitation to participate in a workshop organised by Microsoft in Senegal as a potential partners. The cost of travel (about USD $1,500) needed to be covered by the invited organizations, and Afriklinks invested in the project and sent one delegate to this workshop. There were meetings with Microsoft to clarify doubts and answer questions about the project, and one month later (in October 2007) the proposal was selected. The grant was for USD $50,000, which allowed for approximately 200 young girls/women to be trained through the community telecentres.

We opened a bid for FETEMA’s members to apply to be project partners to help with the execution of the project. FETEMA members were informed through the federation website and the distribution list about the project, including eligibility criteria. Twelve telecentres were chosen according to the manager’s level of technical capacity, as well as the availability of adequate equipment. We used communication via the local community radio over a two-week period to broadcast project information and beneficiary criteria in French and in at least one local language. A national press conference was held to formally present the project and the locations of the chosen telecentres.

==== Project outcomes ====

After the first year of implementation, 42 young girls out of the total 200 involved in the project got a job in their communities. The remaining girls were either hoping to open their own local cybercafés, or to continue studying to obtain a professional diploma.

The project budget covered the telecentres’ training costs, and it provided FETEMA with some core funding (approximately 5% of the total funds). All telecentres involved in the project agreed to share their resources between them.

We see this activity as a social enterprise that permitted young girls/women at the local community level to develop ICT skills, bringing some revenue to individual telecentres, and also to the network as a franchise fee.

In 2008, Afriklinks presented another proposal to Microsoft to help young girls create their own businesses. If approved, the project will receive USD $50,000 to be implemented in February 2009. The project would allow for ten new telecentres to be created by Afriklinks using refurbished computers, to be managed by some of the newly trained girls in their communities. FETEMA will order the refurbished computers and re-sell them to telecentres that need to improve their technical equipment, getting some revenue in the process.

==== Lessons learned ====

* The rather new FETEMA executive board, whose members are fully employed within the telecentres or their hosting institutions, did not have the capacity to write effective proposals at the time of application. It is therefore recommendable for the FETEMA telecentre network to initiate training sessions on fundraising for its members. The 
* Afriklinks team had the capcity to submit the proposal due to support from telecentre.org and USAID, otherwise it would have been very difficult to conduct the process.

* Access to some initial funds is critical to begin network activities: the network needs to be able to hire people who competent in communication and fundraising activities.

* The project was one of ‘learning by doing’ for both the telecentre network and the selected telecentres involved.
Accountability and regular reporting to donors and partners are a crucial part of the fundraising process.

=== Quick Tips for Financial Sustainability ===

* Dependence on only one source of financing should be avoided, even if it provides significant funding or if it appears stable: the situation can change from one day to the next. 

* It is (operationally) necessary to plan for the short term, called annual action plans. It is also (strategically) necessary to have long-term strategies and planning (that is, planning at least five years ahead).

* Financial sustainability for telecentres or for telecentre networks does not guarantee overall sustainability: other dimensions like social, institutional and technological sustainability are important as well. 

* Content and services from individual telecentres can be combined into a network-wide catalogue of content and services, to respond to the needs of telecentres users all around the network.

* A telecentre network can help telecentres to expand their range of products and services beyond the traditional ICT-related ones, such as ICT technical support and training, to include health, e-government, and educational related products and services, for example. 

* Using a proper distribution strategy, a telecentre network can offer products and services that come from national and international entities. 

* Building the capacity of individual telecentres to formulate good project proposals (including the provision of helpful materials like proposal templates) is a practical way to help the overall sustainability of the network by contributing to individual telecentre sustainability.

* It may prove useful to provide incentives for telecentres to keep financially contributing to the network, for example, by inviting only those telecentres to events who are consistently paying their fees. 

* If a government is going to set up a telecentre program, or if it already supports telecentre programs, one of its central ‘smart’ investments should be in telecentre networks. 

* It should never be assumed that project funding will be extended beyond the life of a given project. Therefore, any related measures for extended financing or in seeking additional project phases should be timely and taken accordingly. For example, networks can negotiate with the donor early on, arrange for project evaluations, become familiar with the donor’s calendar, prepare new projects, etc.).

* Non-financial resource contributions such as expertise and human and technological resources can contribute powerfully to sustainability needs (including the financial sustainability). 

* Social enterprise business models can be appropriate for telecentre networks, just as they are for individual telecentres. But they require a relatively strong level of institutional capacity to succeed.

* The closer a social enterprise is to the telecentre’s overall mission of strengthening telecentres, the higher its potential impact.

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Math&lt;/code&gt; class allows for the use of many common mathematical functions that can be used while creating programs.

Since it is in the &lt;code&gt;java.lang&lt;/code&gt; package, the &lt;code&gt;Math&lt;/code&gt; class need not be imported. However, in programs extensively utilizing these functions, a static import can be used.

== Math constants ==
There are two constants in the &lt;code&gt;Math&lt;/code&gt; class that are fairly accurate approximations of irrational mathematical numbers.

=== Math.E ===
The &lt;code&gt;Math.E&lt;/code&gt; constant, or the base of natural logarithms, represents the value of ''e'', the base of the natural logarithms, about 2.718282.
{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.20: &lt;code&gt;Math.E&lt;/code&gt;'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public static final double E = 2.718281828459045;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

=== Math.PI ===
The &lt;code&gt;Math.PI&lt;/code&gt; constant represents the value of pi, the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, about 3.14159265.
{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.21: &lt;code&gt;Math.PI&lt;/code&gt;'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public static final double PI = 3.141592653589793;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== Math methods ==

=== Exponential methods ===
There are several methods in the &lt;code&gt;Math&lt;/code&gt; class that deal with exponential functions.
==== Exponentiation ====
The power method, &lt;code&gt;{{Java:double}} Math.'''pow'''({{Java:double}}, {{Java:double}})&lt;/code&gt;, returns the first parameter to the power of the second parameter.  For example, a call to &lt;code&gt;Math.pow(2, 10)&lt;/code&gt; will return a value of 1024.

The &lt;code&gt;{{Java:double}} Math.'''exp'''({{Java:double}})&lt;/code&gt; method, a special case of &lt;code&gt;pow&lt;/code&gt;, returns ''e'' to the power of the parameter. In addition, &lt;code&gt;{{Java:double}} Math.'''expm1'''({{Java:double}})&lt;/code&gt; returns (''e''&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; - 1). Both of these methods are more accurate and convenient in these special cases.

Java also provides special cases of the pow function for square roots and cube roots of {{Java:double}}s, &lt;code&gt;{{Java:double}} Math.'''sqrt'''({{Java:double}})&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;{{Java:double}} Math.'''cbrt'''({{Java:double}})&lt;/code&gt;.

==== Logarithms ====
Java has no general logarithm function; when needed this can be simulated using the change-of-base theorem.

&lt;code&gt;{{Java:double}} Math.'''log'''({{Java:double}})&lt;/code&gt; returns the natural logarithm of the parameter ('''not the common logarithm''', as its name suggests!).

&lt;code&gt;{{Java:double}} Math.'''log10'''({{Java:double}})&lt;/code&gt; returns the common (base-10) logarithm of the parameter.

&lt;code&gt;{{Java:double}} Math.'''log1p'''({{Java:double}})&lt;/code&gt; returns ln(parameter+1). It is recommended for small values.

=== Trigonometric and hyperbolic methods ===
The trigonometric methods of the &lt;code&gt;Math&lt;/code&gt; class allow users to easily deal with trigonometric functions in programs. All accept only {{Java:double}}s. Please note that all values using these methods are initially passed and returned in '''radians''', ''not degrees''.  However, conversions are possible.

==== Trigonometric functions ====
The three main trigonometric methods are &lt;code&gt;Math.'''sin'''(x)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Math.'''cos'''(x)&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Math.'''tan'''(x)&lt;/code&gt;, which are used to find the sine, cosine, and tangent, respectively, of any given number. So, for example, a call to &lt;code&gt;Math.sin(Math.PI/2)&lt;/code&gt; would return a value of about 1.  Although methods for finding the cosecant, secant, and cotangent are not available, these values can be found by taking the reciprocal of the sine, cosine, and tangent, respectively.  For example, the cosecant of pi/2 could be found using &lt;code&gt;1/Math.sin(Math.PI/2)&lt;/code&gt;.

==== Inverse trigonometric functions ====
Java provides inverse counterparts to the trigonometric functions: &lt;code&gt;Math.'''asin'''(x)&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Math.'''acos'''(x)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Math.'''atan'''(x)&lt;/code&gt;.

==== Hyperbolic functions ====
In addition, hyperbolic functions are available: &lt;code&gt;Math.'''sinh'''(x)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Math.'''cosh'''(x)&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Math.'''tanh'''(x)&lt;/code&gt;.

==== Radian/degree conversion ====
To convert between degree and radian measures of angles, two methods are available, &lt;code&gt;Math.'''toRadians'''(x)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Math.'''toDegrees'''(x)&lt;/code&gt;.  While using &lt;code&gt;Math.toRadians(x)&lt;/code&gt;, a degrees value must be passed in, and that value in radians (the degree value multiplied by pi/180) will be returned.  The &lt;code&gt;Math.toDegrees(x)&lt;/code&gt; method takes in a value in radians and the value in degrees (the radian value multiplied by 180/pi) is returned.

=== Absolute value: &lt;code&gt;Math.abs&lt;/code&gt; ===
The absolute value method of the &lt;code&gt;Math&lt;/code&gt; class is compatible with the {{Java:int}}, {{Java:long}}, {{Java:float}}, and {{Java:double}} types. The data returned is the absolute value of parameter (how far away it is from zero) in the same date type.  For example:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.22: &lt;code&gt;Math.abs&lt;/code&gt;'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int result = Math.abs(-3);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
In this example, &lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt; will contain a value of 3.

=== Maximum and minimum values ===
These methods are very simple comparing functions.  Instead of using {{Java:if}}...{{Java:else}} statements, one can use the &lt;code&gt;Math.max(x1, x2)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Math.min(x1, x2)&lt;/code&gt; methods.  The &lt;code&gt;Math.max(x1, x2)&lt;/code&gt; simply returns the greater of the two values, while the &lt;code&gt;Math.min(x1, x2)&lt;/code&gt; returns the lesser of the two.  Acceptable types for these methods include {{Java:int}}, {{Java:long}}, {{Java:float}}, and {{Java:double}}.

== Functions dealing with floating-point representation ==
Java 1.5 and 1.6 introduced several non-mathematical functions specific to the computer floating-point representation of numbers.

&lt;code&gt;Math.'''ulp'''({{Java:double}})&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Math.'''ulp'''({{Java:float}})&lt;/code&gt; return an ulp, the smallest value which, when added to the argument, would be recognized as larger than the argument.

&lt;code&gt;Math.copySign&lt;/code&gt; returns the value of the first argument with the sign of the second argument. It can be used to determine the sign of a zero value.

&lt;code&gt;Math.getExponent&lt;/code&gt; returns (as an {{Java:int}}) the exponent used to scale the floating-point argument in computer representation.

== Rounding number example ==

Sometimes, we are not only interested in mathematically correct rounded numbers, but we want that a fixed number of significant digits are always displayed, regardless of the number used. Here is an example program that returns always the correct string. You are invited to modify it such that it does the same and is simpler!

The constant class contains repeating constants that should exist only once in the code so that to avoid inadvertent changes. (If the one constant is changed inadvertently, it is most likely to be seen, as it is used at several locations.)
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-20&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 3.20: Common.java'''&lt;/span&gt;

If you are interested in a comparison with [[w:C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], take a look at the [[C Sharp Programming/The .NET Framework/Console Programming#Rounding number example|rounding number example]] there. If you are interested in a comparison with [[w:C++|C++]], you can compare this code here with the same [[C%2B%2B_Programming/Code/IO#.E2.80.8ERounding_number_example|example]] over there.

Notice that in the expression starting with &lt;code&gt;if ((D == 0)&lt;/code&gt;, I have to use OR instead of the &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; because of a bug in the source template.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The Accounting Equation'''

The fundamental accounting equation, which is also known as the balance sheet equation looks like this:

Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity

or

Assets = Liabilities + Capital

On the left-hand-side of the equation are the resources (assets) of the business. Or more correctly, the term assets &quot;represents&quot; the value of the resources of the business. On the other side of the equation are claims of ownership on those assets. Liabilities are the claims of creditors (those &quot;outside&quot; the business). The equity, or owner's equity, is the claim of the owners of the business (those &quot;inside&quot; the business). 

This equation is kept in balance after every business transaction. Everything falls under these three elements in a business transaction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Characteristics of myoglobin ===
Myoglobin is a relatively small protein of mass 17.8kDa made up of 153 amino acids in a single polypeptide chain. It was the first protein to have its three-dimensional structure determined by x-ray crystallography by John Kendrew in 1957. Myoglobin is a typical globular protein in that it is a highly folded compact structure with most of the hydrophobic amino acid residues buried in the interior and many of the polar residues on the surface. X-ray crystallography revealed that the single polypeptide chain of myoglobin consist entirely of alpha-helical secondary structure. In fact there are eight alpha-helical secondary structure in myoglobin. Within a hydrophobic cervice formed by the folding of the polypeptide chain is the heme prosthetic group. This nonpolypeptide unit is noncovalently bound to myoglobin and is essential for the biological activity of the protein.
Myoglobin is a small oxygen-binding protein found in muscle cells. Its functions primarily in storing oxygen and facilitating oxygen diffusion in muscle tissue. Myoglobin is a single-chain globular [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]] that consists of 153 [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]] and a heme group (an iron-containing porphyrin).  The globular structure of myoglobin consists mainly of alpha helices linked together by various turns. Myoglobin exists either in an oxygen free-form called deoxymyoglobin or in a oxygen bound form called oxymyoglobin. Whether myoglobin binds to oxygen depends on the presence of the prosthetic group, heme. 
When myoglobin is able to bind to oxygen, it serves as the primary oxygen-carrying molecule in muscle tissue. Normally, the iron group in myoglobin has an oxidation state of 2+.  However, when oxygen binds to the iron, it gets oxidized to an oxidation state of 3+.  This allows the oxygen that is binded to have a negative charge, which stabilizes it.  Myoglobin's affinity for oxygen is higher than [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]]. And unlike hemoglobin which is found in the red blood cells, myoglobin is found in muscle tissues.

[[Image:Myoglobin.png|thumb|3D structure of myoglobin.]]

Myoglobin owes its high affinity for oxygen to several factors. First, it has a proximal histidine group that helps it bind oxygen. Once the oxygen has been successfully bound, the structure of myoglobin comes into play. It prevents the reactive oxygen species from escaping by modifying the intrinsic reactivity of the heme group. Specifically, the ferrous ion coordinated with the dioxygen in the heme group can be oxidized to a ferric ion coordinated to superoxide. By keeping the reactivity of the oxygen under control with help from its structure, therefore, myoglobin can bind and hold on to oxygen atoms. 

Although it has a much higher affinity for oxygen than its structural analog [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]], myoglobin is a less efficient oxygen carrier for the cell. Because its affinity for oxygen is so high, myoglobin has a difficult time &quot;letting go&quot; of oxygen in the right areas. The cell needs oxygen to be distributed to the appropriate organelles, just as the body needs oxygen to be distributed to the right organ systems. This means that the species that &quot;carries&quot; the oxygen must be capable of releasing it once it reaches its assigned destination. Myoglobin's high affinity for oxygen means that it will be less inclined to release the oxygen once it has been bound; this in turn means that myoglobin will be distributing less oxygen to those areas where it is needed. Thus, [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] is actually a more efficient oxygen carrier for the cell since its affinity for oxygen is lower. A lower affinity means that [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] will have a significantly easier time releasing oxygen in the correct areas of the body. For this reason, the cell relies more upon [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] to distribute oxygen than it does myoglobin; however there are specific areas of the body for which myoglobin is the better oxygen-carrier, such as for muscle cells. More can be read about [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] in the [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] section. 

Another consequence of myoglobin's high affinity for oxygen is a higher affinity constant (K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;). Since the affinity constant represents the concentration of substrate at which fifty percent of a protein's active sites are saturated, this means that half of myoglobin's active sites will be saturated with oxygen at a much lower concentration than for [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]]. More can be read about the affinity constant in its appropriate section.


[[Image:HemoglobinCurve.png|thumb|3D structure of myoglobin.]]

Haemoglobin, the analog of myoglobin, consists of four poly peptide chains, two identical alpha chains and two identical beta chains. Each of the subunits contains a set of alpha helices in the same arrangement as the alpha helices in myoglobin. This structure that recurs is called a globin fold.

The oxygen-binding properties of proteins can be observed by viewing its oxygen-binding curve. An oxygen binding curve is a “plot of fractional saturation versus the concentration of oxygen”.

=== Real world examples: How is Myoglobin used? ===

Myoglobin is actually used in conjunction with troponin to assist in the diagnosis process of a heart attack. Myoglobin levels appear to rise within two to three hours of a heart attack or other muscle injury. These levels reach their peak within eight to twelve hours, but usually fall back to normal within one day. The reason myoglobin is used as the key marker is because it turns positive far sooner than troponin. A positive reading may or may not signal potential damage of the heart, so it often can be ambiguous. Thus, a positive result is assessed based on troponin testing. However, a negative myoglobin result rules out a heart attack altogether. Another interesting fact regarding myoglobin is that it is highly toxic to the kidneys and if severe muscle injury occurs, blood levels of myoglobin may rise quickly and the kidneys (which function includes: releasing myoglobin in the blood as urine) can be severely damaged due to the increase amount of myoglobin. Another cause of increased myoglobin content is strenuous exercise, in addition to heavy alcohol abuse. In regard to muscle contraction, as fibres contract, they sqeeze the walls of the capillaries thus reducing or even stopping blood flow completely. It is actually during these situations when myoglobin has the ability to release its oxygen. It seems apparent that myoglobin plays the role of a hero. As the muscle relaxes, flow is restored and myoglobin is then recharged using the oxygen supplied by its oxygen-carrier partner, hemoglobin. These actions  cause muscle injury and increased myoglobin in blood, which ultimately result in kidney failure. 

=== Myoglobin's further importance ===

Myoglobin plays the pivotal role of acting as an oxygen store during times of severely reduced blood oxygen supply. This notion of course is well established. What is also interesting to note is the fact that in terrestrial mammals, myoglobin compensates for the reduced blood flow in the crucial organ of the heart in addition to skeletal muscles during contraction.

[[Image:Hemoglobin.jpg|thumb|The 3D structure of hemoglobin.]]

'''Hemoglobin''' (''Haemoglobin'' in many varieties of English) is a tetramer consisting of two dimers that binds to oxygen. Hemoglobin is the oxygen binding protein of red blood cells and is a globular protein with quaternary structure. Hemoglobin consists of four polypeptide subunits; 2 alpha chains and two beta chains. Hemoglobin transports oxygen in the blood from the lungs to the rest of the body. The three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin was solved using X-ray crystallography in 1959 by Max Perutz. The structure of hemoglobin is very similar to the single polypeptide chain in myoglobin despite the fact that their amino aicd sequences differ at 83% of the residues. This highlights a relatively common theme in protein structure: that very different primary sequences can specify very similar three-dimensional structures. 

There are two states in the hemoglobin, the T state (the tense state) and the R state (the relaxed state).  The T state has a less of an affinity for oxygen than the R state.  In the concerted mode of cooperativity, the hemoglobin must either be in its T state or R state.  In the sequential mode of cooperativity, the conformation state of the monomer changes as it binds to oxygen.  Actual experimental observation of hemoglobin shows that it is more complex than either of the models and is somewhere in between the two.  The conformation of hemoglobin also changes as the oxygen binds to the iron, raising both the iron and the histidine residue bound to it.  The oxygen binding changes the position of the iron ion by approximately 0.4 A.  Before oxygenation the iron ion lies slightly outside the plane of the porphyrin upon oxygenation it moves into the plane of the heme.
The oxygen affinity of hemoglobin decreases as the pH decreases.  This is useful because with a high affinity for oxygen in the lungs, hemoglobin can effectively bind to more oxygen.  Once it reaches the muscle, where the pH is lower, the lowered affinity for oxygen allows hemoglobin to release its oxygen into the muscle tissues.  When carbon dioxide diffuses into red blood cells, its dissociation also causes a decrease in pH.  As a result, hemoglobin releases more oxygen in the presence of carbon dioxide. As hemoglobin transports oxygen from oxygen-rich lung to metabolizing tissues that have high levels of carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions, it is likely that hemoglobin has evolved to release more oxygen in the tissues, where it reacts with carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions, to support the tissues. 

Carbon dioxide not only lowers the pH, increasing the likelihood that hemoglobin will release its bound oxygen, but carbon dioxide also acts as a poison for the body. Its affinity for binding to oxygen is even greater than that of hemoglobin, so it will take up all of the surrounding oxygen as well as any oxygen that hemoglobin is then made to release. Hemoglobin has a lower affinity for oxygen than myglobin does, and this works very well because myoglobin exists only in the muscles. So when hemoglobin travels to the muscles to deliver oxygen, the myoglobin can easily accept the oxygen and the hemoglobin can easily release it. Hemoglobin does not have an extraordinarily high affinity for oxygen in the first place because it exists in the lungs where oxygen is plentiful and it can easily bind it. So when something like carbon dioxide, that has a stronger affinity for oxygen than hemoglobin, exists in the lungs with hemoglobin, it will steal all of the oxygen before hemoglobin can bind it. This will prevent hemoglobin from binding any oxygen and cause the cells to suffocate.

== Relative Affinity and Efficiency ==

The affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen is less than its structural analog myoglobin. Interestingly enough, however, this does not affect hemoglobin's usefulness for the body; on the contrary, it allows hemoglobin to be a more efficient oxygen carrier than myoglobin. This is so because hemoglobin can release oxygen more easily than can myoglobin. While it is important for oxygen to be carried to different areas of the body, it is even more important for the oxygen to be released when needed. The higher the affinity of a given protein for oxygen, the harder it will be for that protein to release oxygen when the time comes. Thus, hemoglobin's lower affinity for oxygen serves it well because it allows hemoglobin to release oxygen more easily in the body. Myoglobin, on the other hand, has a significantly higher affinity for oxygen and will therefore be much less inclined to release it once it is bound. Thus hemoglobin's lower affinity for oxygen relative to myoglobin allows it to have a higher overall efficiency in binding and then releasing oxygen species. For this reason the body tends to use hemoglobin more often for oxygen-distributing purposes, although myoglobin is used as well, particularly for carrying oxygen to muscle cells. More can be read on myoglobin in the appropriate section.

Also worth mentioning is the fact that fetal hemoglobin has a noticeably higher affinity for oxygen than does maternal hemoglobin. This is of crucial importance during pregnancy in human females (and presumably in other pregnant mammalian females) because it allows the fetus to obtain much-needed oxygen during development. Basically, the hemoglobin present in the fetus is able to strip oxygen species from the maternal hemoglobin when the mother's blood comes into contact with fetal material. The portion of the mother's blood that does not touch the fetus transfers oxygen as normal to the mother's organ systems.

When oxygen is bound to hemoglobin, the color changes to crimson red. When oxygen is not bound, the color becomes blue or purple. Hemoglobin's affinity to oxygen increases as more oxygen is bound to it. The disassociation curve represents how hemoglobin is cooperative to oxygen with its sigmoidal shape.
- The left shift shows an increase in oxygen affinity. Hemoglobin has a better chance to hold onto oxygen. This normally occurs with change in environmental factors such as low temperature, low metabolism rate, and high pH.

- The right shift shows a decrease in affinity. Hemoglobin is more likely to release Oxygen. This is due to high temperature, high metabolism, and low pH.

While Hemoglobin has 4 subunits, Myoglobin has one subunit. It is the enzyme of oxygen storage within the cells (found in skeletal muscle cells). The reason muscles are red is because they contain large amount of myoglobin. Organisms such as diving mammals have very large amounts of myoglobin so that they can go for an extended period of time without breathing.

== States ==

As mentioned above, hemoglobin exists in two distinct states: the '''T-state''' and the '''R-state'''. The T-state of hemoglobin is the more &quot;'''T'''ense&quot; of the two; this is the deoxy form of hemoglobin (meaning that it lacks an oxygen species) and is also known as &quot;deoxyhemoglobin. The R-state of hemoglobin is more &quot;'''R'''elaxed&quot; and is the fully oxygenated form; it is also known as
&quot;oxyhemoglobin.&quot;[[File:Hemoglobin t-r state ani.gif|300px|center]]

== Cooperativity ==

One of the unique features of hemoglobin is that it exhibits cooperativity. This means that hemoglobin can transmit intramolecular messages to its various functional groups to help it attain a maximum affinity for the ligand of interest, which is oxygen in this case. When a monomer of hemoglobin binds to oxygen, it alerts other nearby hemoglobin monomers to start the binding process as well. This means that, as more and more oxygen is bound by hemoglobin monomers, the affinity of hemoglobin will increase more and more as well. In other words, the affinity of hemoglobin is proportional to the quantity of oxygen bound at a given time. This allows hemoglobin to increase its affinity for oxygen over time, a property that brands it as one of the most flexible proteins in the body. Because it can modify its affinity for oxygen, hemoglobin can exhibit a range of different affinities. As stated before, this makes it quite flexible in terms of how much oxygen it can bind and therefore how much it can release. This is one of the reasons that the body prefers to use hemoglobin, as opposed to myoglobin, for oxygen transport: hemoglobin can modify its own affinity for oxygen to suit the situation at hand, making it capable of handling a wider variety of chemical environments and organ systems while still being able to distribute oxygen effectively.


=== Models of Cooperativity ===
[[File:Concerted model.jpg|thumb|concerted model for hemoglobin]]
[[File:Sequential model.jpg|thumb|sequential model for hemoglobin]]
There are two main models of cooperativity for hemoglobin. One of these is the '''concerted''' model of cooperativity. This model states that the hemoglobin molecule changes rapidly between its R- and T-states in order to maximize its affinity for oxygen. According to this model, hemoglobin is constantly &quot;flipping&quot; back and forth between states in an attempt to bind as much oxygen as possible. The other model is the '''sequential''' model of cooperativity. This model maintains that one strand of hemoglobin starts a sequence of conformational changes in hemoglobin that increase its affinity for oxygen. When one strand of hemoglobin binds oxygen, the hemoglobin rearranges in a manner that favors additional oxygen binding. When the next oxygen is bound, another conformational change occurs to further supplement binding; Thus, hemoglobin can sequentially increase its affinity for oxygen as more and more of its strands bind oxygen. 

Experimental data obtained from kinetics experiments with hemoglobin reveals that neither the concerted nor the sequential model of cooperativity is heavily favored. If anything, the data suggests that hemoglobin's behavior represents a hybrid of the two models; thus hemoglobin's cooperativity is somewhere in between the concerted and sequential models. 

It is known that hemoglobin undergoes several conformational changes upon binding with oxygen. First of all, as soon as the iron cation within hemoglobin begins to move, the Histidine residues and the alpha-helix of hemoglobin start moving as well to stabilize the changes caused by the movement of iron. Second, the carboxyl terminal end of the alpha-helix usually resides at the interface between the two alpha- and beta-dimers that make up hemoglobin. Finally, the positional changes of the carboxyl terminal end create favorable conditions for transitions between the T- and the R-states of hemoglobin. 

The above description makes clear that the concerted and sequential models do not fully explain hemoglobin's behavior, nor the behavior of related classes of proteins. To account for this discrepancy, more complex models have been devised that more accurately reflect the kinetic data gained from experiments with hemoglobin binding.

==Oxygen Binding Curve==
Oxygen binding to iron in the heme group pulls part of the electron density from the ferrous ion to the oxygen molecule. It is important to leave the myoglobin in the dioxygen form rather than superoxide form when the oxygen is released because the superoxide can be generated by itself to have a new form that gives negative effect on many biological materials, and also the superoxide prevents the iron ion from binding to the oxygen in its ferric state (Metmyoglobin). Superoxide and superoxide-derived oxygen species are so reactive compared to the stable O2 molecule that they could have a destructive effect both within the cell and in its environment.  A distal histidine residue in myoglobin regulates the reactivity of the heme group to make it more suitable for oxygen binding. It does this by H-bonding with the oxygen molecule; the additional electron density of the oxygen molecule makes the H-bond unusually strong and therefore even more effective as a stabilizing agent.

An oxygen-binding curve is a plot that shows fractional saturation versus the concentration of oxygen. By definition, fractional saturation indicates the presence of binding sites that have oxygen. Fractional saturation can range from zero (all sites are empty) to one (all sites are filled). The concentration of oxygen is determined by partial pressure. 

Hemoglobin's oxygen affinity is relatively weak compared to myoglobin's affinity for oxygen.  Hemoglobin's oxygen-binding curve forms in the shape of a sigmoidal curve.  This is due to the cooperativity of the hemoglobin. As hemoglobin travels from the lungs to the tissues, the pH value of it's surroundings decrease, and the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that it reacts with increases.  Both these changes causes the hemoglobin to lose it's affinity for oxygen, therefore making it drop the oxygen into the tissues.  This causes the sigmoidal curve for hemoglobin in the oxygen-binding curve and proves it's cooperativity.

[[Image:oxygen_binding_curve.jpg]] [[Image:Oxygen_binding_curve_with_hemoglobin_and_myoglobin.jpg]]

This image shows hemoglobin's oxygen binding affinity compared with myoglobin's affinity and the hypothetical curve that hemoglobin would have to follow if it did not show cooperativity.  In this graph, you can see hemoglobin's sigmoidal curve, how it starts out with a little less affinity than myoglobin, but comparable affinity to oxygen in the lungs.  As the pressure drops and the myoglobin and hemoglobin move towards the tissues, myoglobin still attains it's high affinity for oxygen, while hemoglobin, because of it's cooperativity, suddenly loses it's affinity, therefore making it the better transporter of oxygen than myoglobin.  The gray curve, showing no cooperativity, shows that to have the low affinity for oxygen needed in the tissues, the hemoglobin would have started with a smaller affinity for oxygen, therefore making it less efficient in bringing oxygen in from the lungs.

===Oxygen Binding Curve for Hemoglobin===
[[File:2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate.svg|thumb|right|2',3'-Bisphosphoglycerate]]
In red blood cells, the oxygen-binding curve for hemoglobin displays an “S” shaped called a sigmoidal curve. A sigmoidal curve shows that oxygen binding is cooperative; that is, when one site binds oxygen, the probability that the remaining unoccupied sites that will bind to oxygen will increase. 

The importance of cooperative behavior is that it allows hemoglobin to be more efficient in transporting oxygen. For example, in the lungs, the hemoglobin is at a saturation level of 98%. However, when hemoglobin is present in the tissues and releases oxygen, the saturation level drops to 32%; thus, 66% of the potential oxygen-binding sites are involved in the transportation of oxygen.

Purified hemoglobin binds much more tightly to the oxygen, making it less useful in oxygen transport. The difference in characteristics is due to the presence of 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate(2,3-BPG) in human blood, which acts as an allosteric effector. An allosteric effector binds in one site and affects binding in another. 2,3-BPG binds to a pocket in the T-state of hemoglobin and is released as it forms the R-state. The presence of 2,3-BPG means that more oxygen must be bound to the hemoglobin before the transition to the R-form is possible.

Other regulation such as the Bohr effect in hemoglobin can also be depicted via an oxygen-binding curve. By analyzing the oxygen-binding curve, one can observe that there is a proportional relationship between affinity of oxygen and pH level. As the pH level decreases, the affinity of oxygen in hemoglobin also decreases. Thus, as hemoglobin approaches a region of low pH, more oxygen is released. The chemical basis for this Bohr effect is due to the formation of two salt bridges of the quaternary structure. One of the salt bridges is formed by the interaction between Beta Histidine 146 (the carboxylate terminal group) and Alpha Lysine 40. This connection will help to orient the histidine residue to also interact in another salt bridge formation with the negatively charged aspartate 94.  The second bridge is form with the aid of an additional proton on the histidine residue.

As carbon dioxide diffuses into red blood cells, it reacts with water inside to form carbonic acid. Carbonic acid disociated leads to lower pH and stabilizes the T state.

[[Image:PH on hemoglobin.JPG]]

An oxygen-binding curve can also show the effect of carbon dioxide presence in hemoglobin. The regulation effect by carbon dioxide is similar to Bohr effect. A comparison of the effect of the absence and presence of carbon dioxide in hemoglobin revealed that hemoglobin is more efficient at transporting oxygen from tissues to lungs when carbon dioxide is present. The reason for this efficiency is that carbon dioxide also decreases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. The addition of carbon dioxide forces the pH to drop, which then causes the affinity of hemoglobin to oxygen to decrease.  This is extremely evident in the tissues, where the carbon dioxide stored in the tissues are released into the blood stream, then undergoes a reaction that releases H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; into the blood stream, increasing acidity and dropping the pH level.

== Allosteric affectors of hemoglobin ==


'''Allosteric regulation''' is the process by which the behavior of proteins is controlled by other molecules; the molecules that perform this regulation are known as allosteric regulators. This process involves the binding of an allosteric regulator molecule to the protein in question; the result is a distinct effect on the protein's function. Allosteric regulators that increase or supplement a given protein's function are known as '''allosteric activators'''. Those that decrease or interrupt a given protein's function are known as '''allosteric inhibitors'''. 

Hemoglobin, like other proteins, has its share of allosteric regulators. Regulation is highly necessary for a protein as important as hemoglobin, since its affinity for oxygen must be just right for the particular organ system that it is currently dealing with. Thus the main concern for most of hemoglobin's allosteric regulators is tweaking its oxygen affinity to match the situation at hand. 

The advantages of cell using allosteric inhibitors are:
- In a typical metabolic pathways, the final product of the pathway acts as an allosteric inhibitor.
- It inhibits the 1st enzyme in the pathway saving the cell from using resources in a metabolic pathway which final product is abundant. 

'''Biphosphoglycerate''', or BPG, is one of many allosteric regulators for hemoglobin. This molecule binds to the central cavity of the deoxyhemoglobin version of hemoglobin (T-state) and stabilizes it. The increased stability of the T-state results in a decreased affinity for oxygen, since normally it is the intense straining of the T-state that drives deoxyhemoglobin to bind to oxygen; once oxygen is bound, the T-state loses its strain and relaxes into the R-state. Thus, by stabilizing the normally tense T-state, BPG makes hemoglobin less likely to bind oxygen in an attempt to release the strain. This mechanism is necessary, because the T state of hemoglobin is so unstable that the equilibrium lies very strongly in favor of the R state and little to no oxygen is released. In other words, pure hemoglobin binds to oxygen very tightly. 2,3-BPG was thus needed to stabilize the T state. Because BPG decreases hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen, it is an allosteric inhibitor of hemoglobin. Without 2, 3-BPG, hemoglobin would be an extremely inefficient transporter of oxygen from the lungs to the tissues, releasing only about 8% of its oxygen content. However, in the presence of 2,3-BPG, more oxygen-binding sites in the hemoglobin tetramer must be filled in order to transition from the T to the R state. Higher concentrations of oxygen must be reached in order for hemoglobin to transition from the lower-affinity T-state to the higher-affinity R state. 

[[File:BPG.jpg]]

The binding of 2,3-BPG has further physiological consequences. Fetal hemoglobin has a higher oxygen-binding affinity than that of maternal hemoglobin. Fetal red blood cells have a higher affinity for oxygen than maternal red blood cells because fetal hemoglobin doesn't bind 2,3-BPG as well as maternal hemoglobin does. The result of this difference in oxygen affinity allows oxygen to be transferred effectively from maternal to fetal red blood cells.  

The '''pH''', or proton concentration of a given solution, is another allosteric regulator of hemoglobin. Interestingly enough, pH can act as both an allosteric activator and inhibitor, depending on the direction of pH change. As pH decreases, for example, the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen decreases as well. This is due to the fact that protons help construct salt bridges in the T-state of hemoglobin. In general, the T-state of hemoglobin is favored by three amino acids that form two salt bridges; one of these salt bridges requires an added proton to form successfully. Thus, the higher the proton concentration (or the lower the pH) in the solution, the easier this salt bridge will form. Better salt bridge formation leads to a better and more stable T-state, and as mentioned before, a more stable T-state means decreased oxygen affinity of hemoglobin. Since higher proton concentration corresponds to lower pH, this means that the lower the pH, the more stable the T-state will be. Finally, the more stable the T-state, the lower the affinity for oxygen will be in hemoglobin molecule; thus pH acts as an allosteric inhibitor of hemoglobin when it is decreasing. Logically, then, the opposite effect would occur when the pH increases. This would signify a lower proton concentration, meaning more difficult salt bridge formation and thus a slower-forming and less stable T-state. A less stable T-state would be much more inclined to bind with oxygen; thus increased pH results in increased oxygen affinity for hemoglobin. The result is that pH acts as an allosteric activator for hemoglobin when it is increasing. 
[[File:PH_effect.jpg‎]]

'''Carbon dioxide''', or CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is yet another allosteric inhibitor of hemoglobin. There are several reasons for this. The first is that the enzyme '''carbonic anhydrase''' can help carbon dioxide react with water to form carbonic acid, which dissociates into bicarbonate and a proton. With enough carbonic anhydrase enzymes present, therefore, carbon dioxide can cause a decrease in the pH of the solution due to all the protons produced from its reaction with water. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, more protons means decreased pH, which in turn means a decreased affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. Carbon dioxide also neutralizes the positive charge on the amino terminus of hemoglobin (amino groups usually exist in their protonated forms in living systems). This charge neutralization results in production of negatively charged carbamate groups, which form salt bridges that lead to stabilization of the T-state of hemoglobin, which results in a decreased affinity for oxygen. Thus carbon dioxide functions as an effective allosteric inhibitor of hemoglobin.

== Bohr effect ==
Bohr effect is a property of hemoglobin which states that at lower pH (more acidic environment), hemoglobin will bind to oxygen with less affinity. Since carbon dioxide is in direct equilibrium with the concentration of protons in the blood, increasing blood carbon dioxide levels leads to a decrease in pH, which ultimately leads to a decrease in affinity for oxygen by hemoglobin.

'''Physiological role''' 
The Bohr effect facilitates oxygen transport.  Hemoglobin binds to oxygen in the lungs and releases it in the tissues predominately to those tissues in most need of oxygen. When a tissue's metabolic rate increases, its carbon dioxide production increases. Carbon dioxide forms bicarbonate through the follow reaction: 
:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt; H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
This reaction usually progresses very slowly.  With the help of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, the formation of bicarbonate and protons in the red blood cells is accelerated.  This causes the pH of the tissue to decrease and promote the dissociation of oxygen from hemoglobin to the tissue, allowing the tissue to obtain enough oxygen to meet its demands. Conversely, in the lungs, oxygen concentration is high.  The binding of oxygen causes hemoglobin to release protons, which combine with bicarbonate to drive off carbon dioxide in exhalation. Since these two reactions are closely matched, there is little change in blood pH.

[[File:Tissues-RBC.png|thumb|left|CO2 transport from Tissues to Red Blood Cells]]
[[File:RBC-Lungs.png|thumb|CO2 transport from Red Blood Cells to Lungs]]

BPG binds to hemoglobin and affect oxygen binding:
BPG binds in the central cavity of T-state hemoglobin. The anion groups of BPG are within Hb-bonding and ion-paring distances of the N-terminal amino group of both b subunits. BPG binds to and stabilizes only the T-state hemoglobin. This shifts the T  R equilibrium toward the T state, which lowers the O2 binding affinity.
BPG is really important for O2 transport in our body. One example is high altitude adaptation. High altitude will induce a rapid increase in the amount of BPG synthesized in erythrocytes. The increased amount of BPG will shift the oxygen binding curve from sea-level position to a lower affinity position (shift to right). This decreases the amount of O2 binding in the lungs, but, to a greater extent, increases the amount of O2 released at tissues. So hemoglobin can deliver more O2 from lungs to tissues.

Sickle cells can cause hemoglobin cells which transport oxygen to the heart and parts of body change their shapes. It makes the transportation happens not smoothly and cause a disease.

==Sickle Cell Anemia==

A disease that affects many individuals's hemoglobin funtionalities is sickle cell anemia, which cause by substitution of Valine  instead of Glutamate at position 6 in amino acid sequence. Symptoms occur when an individual is several months old.
Sickle cell anemia is characterized by decreased breath intake, delayed growth and development, fever, jaundice, rapid heart rate, and many other ailments. 
The problem is that hemoglobin in these indivudals are mutated. This mutated form of hemoglobin is called hemoglobin S and is less soluble than regular hemoglobin forms. Examination of the structure of hemoglobin S reveals that a new valine residue lies on the surface of the T-state molecule.  As a result of this change deoxyhemoglobin has a hydrophobic patch on its surface.  The hydrophobic patch interacts with other hydrophobic patches causing the molecule to aggregate into strands that align into insoluble fibers.  Because
this mutated form cannot move freely when they accumulate in the blood stream they end up rupturing or distorting the shape of the red blood cells when delivering oxygen. The red blood cells
end up becoming a sickle or crescent shape. These inflicted cells are much less efficient in deliver oxygen through the body's circulation. They can clog fairly easily in smaller areas of blood flow
causing them to disrupt blood flow. Sickle cell anemia should not be mistaken with hemophilia which is a disease in which an individual's body cannot form blood clots. If gone without proper treatment, 
people with this disease usually die from organ failure from ages 20 to 40. Better technology and data on this disease has led to treatments that involve folic acid supplements that activate the product of new
healthy red blood cells. Treatment must be ongoing and is meant to limit the number of pains and emergencies of the disease. Overall immune system also suffers from this disease so often people take antibiotics
and vaccines to prevent themselves from getting sick. 

Sickle cell anemia is passed down through families and a child can only receive sickle cell anemia if both parents also have the disease. About 1 in 12 African Americans have this trait.  There is a significant correlation between regions with high frequency of sickle cell anemia and regions with high prevalence of malaria.  People with the sickle cell trait are resistant to malaria because the parasite that carries the disease needs to live within a red blood cell at some point in its life and is unable to survive in a sickle cell.  Therefore, due to natural selection overtime the number of people with sickle cell anemia grew because before there was a cure for malaria the majority of the people who got malaria would die. It is now possible to diagnose sickle
cell anemia during pregnancy. Patients with the disease are encouraged to drink enough fluids, get enough oxygen, responding quickly to infections. Strenuous physical activity should be avoided, smoking should be avoided, and too much 
sun exposure should also be avoided. Extreme consequences of sickle cell anemia no doubt includes death but others include blindness, spleen malfunction, tissue death, strokes, and acute chest pains. 
Below are pictures comparing healthy red blood cells to blood cells inflicted by sickle cell anemia. 

[[File:sickle.jpg]]

==Thalassemia==

Just as sickle cell anemia is a difference in one amino acid, thalassemia is also an inherited disease where there is a reduction or loss of a hemoglobin chain. This leads to lower levels of hemoglobin and those with the disease experience anemia, fatigue, pale skin as well as spleen and liver malfunctions. Thalassemia branches into two different types: α-thalessemia and β-thalessemia. In α-thalessemia, the α-helix of hemoglobin is in low supply. This makes hemoglobin with high affinity for oxygen and no cooperativity therefore, making the release of oxygen in tissue poor. This is caused by a disruption in 4 alleles on chromosome 16 and is more rare. In β-thalessemia, the β-chain is in low  supply. the extra α-helixes will aggregate and precipitate inside red blood cells which can result in anemia. β-thalessemia is caused by disruption on two alleles on chromosome 11. 

==Carbon Monoxide Poisoning==

Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a dangerous gas because it is odorless and colorless. Sources of carbon monoxide include running automobiles and gas-powered appliances.  When inhaled, it binds at the same sites as oxygen and can negatively impact the the body's ability to absorb oxygen. Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin 200 times more tightly than oxygen does. Even at low partial pressures, carbon monoxide will prevent hemoglobin from delivering oxygen to the body. Once carbon monoxide binds to one site of hemoglobin, hemoglobin turns into the R-state which increases oxygen affinity and prevents oxygen dissociation in tissues. 

Treatment of carbon monoxide poisoning includes the administration of 100% oxygen at higher partial pressures. Because of the higher pressure, this will displace most of the carbon monoxide from hemoglobin.

Breathing of 100% O2 helps reduce the half-life of COHb, Carboxyhemoglobin, a stable complex of CO and hemoglobin formed in red blood cells with the presence of CO. Measurement of COHb level in red blood cells is used to confirm exposure to CO and assess the severity of poisoning. Elevated level of COHb is determined more than 2% for nonsmokers and more than 9% for smokers. 

By replacing oxygen in hemoglobin, CO cuts off the supply of oxygen to tissues and cells, which can result in neurological problems in adults, learning disabilities and developmental issues in children, and miscarriage in women during pregnancy. 

CO poisoning symptoms are not obvious, including headache, dizziness, nausea, fatigue and weakness. They can be mistaken as food poisoning, influenza, migraine headache, or substance abuse. 

2 main types of CO poisoning: acute, caused by exposure to high level of CO in a short period of time, and chronic or subacute, caused by exposure to low level of CO in a long  period of time.

'''Impact of CO poisoning on body systems'''

* Neurologic: central nervous system depression, causing headache, dizziness in mild cases and coma, seizure in severe cases. 
* Cardiac: decreased myocardial functions, vasodilatation, and decreased oxygen delivery and utilization by myocardium, causing chest pains, low blood pressure, fast heart rates.
* Metabolic: hyperventilation in mild cases, metabolic acidosis in severe cases.
* Pulmonary: pulmonary edema occurs in 10-30% of acute cases.
* Multiple organ failure: happens at high level of CO poisoning.

Fetal hemoglobin is the main oxygen transport protein. It happens during the last 7 months of development until 8 months later

==Fetal Hemoglobin==

[[Image:Hemoglobin_F.png|thumb|The 3D structure of hemoglobin F]]
A fetus obtains its source of oxygen from the mother’s lungs. The oxygen in the mother’s bloodstreams attaches to hemoglobin molecules in the red blood cells and diffuses to the fetal bloodstream at the placenta. By the time the blood reaches the fetus, the pressure is much lower, which is not enough for a normal adult. 

During the entire fetal formation period, three different types of hemoglobin are produced, with the succeeding hemoglobin deactivating its predecessor. All three types have the same heme molecules and iron atom, but differ slightly in structure. In the first eight weeks, majority of the hemoglobin is a type called embryonic hemoglobin ('''Hemoglobin E'''). The production of Hemoglobin follows by the fetal hemoglobin ('''Hemoglobin F'''). It is the predominant form of hemoglobin expressed in the fetus development. The Hemoglobin F is apparent weeks after conception until a few months after birth. Around the thirty-fifth week, the adult hemoglobin ('''Hemoglobin A''') starts production. Eventually, the blood cells will only contain Hemoglobin A, which is the only one produced for the duration of the human life.

Structural differences between the adult hemoglobin and the fetal hemoglobin

From the structural point of view, the adult hemoglobin is composed of 4 heme groups, 2 '''alpha''' chains and 2 '''beta''' chains. The fetal hemoglobin (also termed haemoglobin F) is also composed of 4 heme groups, 2 '''alpha''' chains and 2 '''gamma''' chains. The gamma chains are referred to as gamma subunits, which are homologous to the beta chains of the adult hemoglobin. In addition, the fetal hemoglobin and adult hemoglobin are found to be different near the 2,3 BPG binding site. The 2,3 BPG binds less tightly with the deoxy form of fetal hemoglobin as compared to the deoxy form of adult hemoglobin.

Additionally, another form of haemoglobin, termed haemoglobin A2, and comprising of two '''alpha''' and two '''delta''' globin chains; is produced in small quantities throughout childhood and adulthood. Haemoglobin A2 accounts for around 2-3% of total haemoglobin levels.

==Blood Doping==
Blood There is also a hormone that can induce the increase of red blood cell production. Erythopoietin is a glycoprotein hormone that controls erythropoiesis, or otherwise known as red blood cell production. It is a protein signaling molecule (cytokine) for erythocyte (red blood cell) precursors in the bone marrow. This hormone is produced in the interstitial fibroblasts in the kidney and in the perisinusoidal cells in the liver.

The fundamental theory of calculus is a critical portion of calculus because it links the concept of a derivative to that of an integral. As a result, we can use our knowledge of derivatives to find the area under the curve, which is often quicker and simpler than using the [[Calculus/Definite integral|definition of the integral]].

==Mean Value Theorem for Integration==
We will need the following theorem in the discussion of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

{{Calculus/Def|text='''Mean Value Theorem for Integration'''
Suppose &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\frac{\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx}{b-a}=f(c)&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;.}}

===Proof of the Mean Value Theorem for Integration===
&lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the requirements of the [[Calculus/Some_Important_Theorems#Extreme_Value_Theorem|Extreme Value Theorem]], so it has a minimum &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and a maximum &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;. Since&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx=\lim\limits _{n\to\infty}\sum\limits _{i=1}^{n}f(x_{i}^{*})\frac{b-a}{n}=\lim\limits _{n\to\infty}\frac{b-a}{n}\sum\limits _{i=1}^{n}f(x_{i}^{*})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
and since&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;m\leq f(x_{i}^{*})\leq M&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x_{i}^{*}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;br/&gt;
we have&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\lim\limits _{n\to\infty}\frac{b-a}{n}\sum\limits _{i=1}^{n}m\leq\lim\limits _{n\to\infty}\frac{b-a}{n}\sum\limits _{i=1}^{n}f(x_{i}^{*})\leq\lim\limits _{n\to\infty}\frac{b-a}{n}\sum\limits _{i=1}^{n}M&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\lim\limits _{n\to\infty}\frac{b-a}{n}nm\leq\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx\leq\lim\limits _{n\to\infty}\frac{b-a}{n}nM&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\lim\limits _{n\to\infty}(b-a)m\leq\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx\leq\lim\limits _{n\to\infty}(b-a)M&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(b-a)m\leq\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx\leq(b-a)M&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;m\leq\frac{\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx}{(b-a)}\leq M&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, by the [[Calculus/Continuity#Intermediate_Value_Theorem|Intermediate Value Theorem]] there is some &lt;math&gt;f(c)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; such that&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx}{b-a}=f(c)&lt;/math&gt;

== Fundamental Theorem of Calculus ==
{{wikipedia|Fundamental theorem of calculus}}
=== Statement of the Fundamental Theorem ===
Suppose that ''f'' is continuous on ''[a,b]''.  We can define a function ''F'' by
:&lt;math&gt;F(x)= \int_a^x f(t)\ dt \mbox{ for } x \mbox{ in } [a,b].&lt;/math&gt;

{{Calculus/Def|text= '''Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part I'''
Suppose ''f'' is continuous on ''[a,b]'' and ''F'' is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;F(x)= \int_a^x f(t)\ dt.&lt;/math&gt;
Then  ''F'' is differentiable on ''(a,b)'' and for all &lt;math&gt;x\in(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; F'(x) = f(x).\, &lt;/math&gt;}}

When we have such functions &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;F^\prime(x)=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in some interval &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; we say that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the '''antiderivative''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;. 

{{Calculus/Def|text= '''Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part II'''
Suppose that ''f'' is continuous on ''[a,b]'' and that ''F'' is any antiderivative of ''f''.  
Then
:&lt;math&gt;\ \int_{a}^{b} f(x)\ dx=F(b)-F(a).&lt;/math&gt;}}

Note: a minority of mathematicians refer to part one as two and part two as one.  All mathematicians refer to what is stated here as part 2 as The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

=== Proofs ===
==== Proof of Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part I ==== 
Suppose ''x'' is in ''(a,b)''.    Pick &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;x+\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; is also in (''a'', ''b''). 
Then
:&lt;math&gt;F(x) = \int_{a}^{x} f(t) dt&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;F(x+\Delta x) = \int_{a}^{x+\Delta x} f(t) dt&lt;/math&gt;.

Subtracting the two equations gives
:&lt;math&gt;F(x + \Delta x) - F(x) = \int_{a}^{x + \Delta x} f(t) dt - \int_{a}^{x} f(t) dt.&lt;/math&gt;

Now 
:&lt;math&gt;
\int_{a}^{x + \Delta x} f(t) dt  = \int_{a}^{x} f(t) dt + \int_{x}^{x + \Delta x} f(t) dt&lt;/math&gt;
so rearranging this we have
:&lt;math&gt;F(x + \Delta x) - F(x) = \int_{x}^{x + \Delta x} f(t) dt.&lt;/math&gt;

According to the Mean Value Theorem for Integration, there exists a ''c'' in [''x'', ''x'' + &amp;Delta;''x''] such that
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{x}^{x + \Delta x}f(t) dt = f(c) \Delta x &lt;/math&gt;.
Notice that ''c'' depends on &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;.  Anyway what we have shown is that
:&lt;math&gt;F(x + \Delta x) - F(x) = f(c) \Delta x \,&lt;/math&gt;, 
and dividing both sides by &amp;Delta;''x'' gives
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{F(x + \Delta x) - F(x)}{\Delta x} = f(c) &lt;/math&gt;.

Take the limit as &lt;math&gt;\Delta x\to 0&lt;/math&gt; we get the definition of the derivative of ''F'' at ''x'' so we have
:&lt;math&gt;F'(x) = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} f(c).&lt;/math&gt;.

To find the other limit, we will use the squeeze theorem. The number ''c'' is in the interval [''x'', ''x'' + &amp;Delta;''x''], so ''x''&amp;le; ''c'' &amp;le; ''x'' + &amp;Delta;''x''.  Also, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} x = x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} x + \Delta x = x&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore, according to the squeeze theorem,
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} c = x&lt;/math&gt;.

As ''f'' is continuous we have
:&lt;math&gt;F'(x) = \lim_{\Delta x\to 0} f(c)=  f\left(\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} c\right) = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;
which completes the proof.

==== Proof of Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part II ====
Define &lt;math&gt; P(x) = \int_a^x f(t) dt.&lt;/math&gt;  Then by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus part I we know that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable on &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; and for all &lt;math&gt;x\in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P'(x) = f(x).\,&lt;/math&gt;
So &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is an antiderivative of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.  Since we were assuming that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; was also an antiderivative for all &lt;math&gt;x\in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;P'(x)=F'(x)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P'(x)-F'(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(P(x)-F(x))'=0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;g(x)=P(x)-F(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  The [[Calculus/Some_Important_Theorems#Mean_Value_Theorem|Mean Value Theorem]] applied to &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;[a,\xi]&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;a&lt;\xi&lt;b&lt;/math&gt; says that&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{g(\xi)-g(a)}{\xi-a}=g'(c)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
for some &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;(a,\xi)&lt;/math&gt;.  But since &lt;math&gt;g'(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g(\xi)&lt;/math&gt; must equal &lt;math&gt;g(a)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. g(x) is constant on &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
This implies there is a constant &lt;math&gt;C=g(a)=P(a)-F(a)=-F(a)&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;x\in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; P(x) = F(x) + C.\,&lt;/math&gt;,
and as &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is continuous we see this holds when &lt;math&gt;x=a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x=b&lt;/math&gt; as well.  And putting &lt;math&gt;x=b&lt;/math&gt; gives
:&lt;math&gt; \int_a^b f(t) dx = P(b) = F(b) + C = F(b) - F(a).&lt;/math&gt;

==Notation for Evaluating Definite Integrals==
The second part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus gives us a way to calculate definite integrals.  Just find an antiderivative of the integrand, and subtract the value of the antiderivative at the lower bound from the value of the antiderivative at the upper bound.  That is&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)dx=F(b)-F(a)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;F'(x)=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  As a convenience, we use the notation&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F(x)\bigr|_a^b&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
to represent &lt;math&gt;F(b)-F(a)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Integration of Polynomials ==
Using the power rule for differentiation we can find a formula for the integral of a power using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.  Let &lt;math&gt;f(x) =x^n&lt;/math&gt;.  We want to find an antiderivative for &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.  Since the differentiation rule for powers lowers the power by 1 we have that
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} x^{n+1} = (n+1)x^n.&lt;/math&gt;
As long as &lt;math&gt;n+1\neq 0&lt;/math&gt; we can divide by &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; to get
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} \left(\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}\right)= x^n = f(x).&lt;/math&gt;
So the function &lt;math&gt;F(x) = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; is an antiderivative of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is not in &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is continuous on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; and, by applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we can calculate the integral of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to get the following rule.

{{Calculus/Def|text= '''Power Rule of Integration I''' &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \int_a^b x^n dx = {x^{n+1} \over {n+1}}\biggr|_a^b = \frac{b^{n+1}-a^{n+1}}{n+1}\;&lt;/math&gt; as long as &lt;math&gt;n\neq -1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is not in &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;.}}

Notice that we allow all values of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, even negative or fractional.  If &lt;math&gt;n&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; then this works even if &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; includes &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

{{Calculus/Def|text= '''Power Rule of Integration II'''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \int_a^b x^n dx = {x^{n+1} \over {n+1}}\biggr|_a^b = \frac{b^{n+1}-a^{n+1}}{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; as long as &lt;math&gt;n&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Examples'''

*To find &lt;math&gt;\int_1^2 x^3 dx&lt;/math&gt; we raise the power by 1 and have to divide by 4.  So
:&lt;math&gt;\int_1^2 x^3 dx = \frac{x^4}{4}\biggr|_1^2 = \frac{2^4}{4} - \frac{1^4}{4} = \frac{15}{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

*The power rule also works for negative powers.  For instance
:&lt;math&gt;\int_1^3 \frac{1}{x^3} dx = \int_1^3  x^{-3} dx = \frac{x^{-2}}{-2}\biggr|_1^3 = \frac{1}{-2}\left(3^{-2}-1^{-2}\right) = -\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{3^2} - 1\right) =-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{9}-1\right) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{8}{9} = \frac{4}{9}.&lt;/math&gt;

*We can also use the power rule for fractional powers.  For instance
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^5 \sqrt x\, dx = \int_0^5 x^{\frac{1}{2}}\, dx =  \frac{x^{\frac{3}{2}}}{\frac{3}{2}}\Biggr|_0^5 = \frac{2}{3}\left(5^{\frac{3}{2}} - 0^{\frac{3}{2}}\right)=\frac{2}{3}\left(5^{\frac{3}{2}}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

* Using linearity the power rule can also be thought of as applying to constants. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;=\int_3^{11} 7\,dx=\int_3^{11} 7x^0\,dx=7\int_3^{11} x^0\,dx=7x \bigr|_3^{11}= 7(11 - 3) = 56&lt;/math&gt;.

*Using the linearity rule we can now integrate any polynomial.  For example
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^3 (3x^2 + 4x +2) dx = (x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x)\bigr|_0^3 = 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3-0 = 27+18+6=51.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Detailed analysis of controller family documentation==
In this section we will be taking an in depth look at the main documentation for one controller out of each PIC microcontroller family. In each case the key documents will be listed and then the datasheet will be analysed chapter by chapter to highlight the information that is provided, and how related information can be found in the cases where the documentation is rather sparse.

In each case we will select a device that is the largest in its class in terms of performance, memory and number of peripherals. All other devices in that family will contain a sub-section of the information contained in the analysed device. There is a lot of similarity between families, and therefore there will be lots of repetition between chapters here, but since each engineer only focusses on one family or device at one time this method of documenting the datasheets here should prove to be most beneficial to the reader.

==1. Describe the national, state or provincial, AY, Pathfinder, and Christian flags.==

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;5&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|-
|[[File:Flag of Indonesia.svg|thumb|left|250px|'''Indonesia :''' ''The Indonesia National Flag is a simple design flag with two colors that are separated into two parts horizontally. The colors were taken from the Majapahit Kingdom. Actually not only the Majapahit Kingdom that use the Merah Putih flag as their magnificence symbol. Before the Majapahit, the Kediri Kingdom already use the Merah Putih as their guidon.

In the time of the Bugis Bone Kingdom, South Sulawesi before Arung Palakka, the Merah Putih, was a symbol for the power and the magnificence of the Kingdom. The Bone Flag itself known as the Woromporang.

In the time of the Javanesee War (1825-1830 M) Pangeran Diponegoro use the Merah Putih as their guidon on their struggle against the VOC.

The Flag that were called Sang Merah Putih was first use by the students and the nasionalist in the early of 20 centuries under the power of the Netherlands. After the world war II ended, Indonesia receive their independence on August 17, 1945 and begin to use the Merah Putih as their National Flag. The Indonesia Flag have two Phylosophic meaning. Red means brave, white means holy. Red represent the human body, while white represent the human soul. Both mutually equip and round off for Indonesia.'']]
|[[Image:Pathfinderflag.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Pathfinder Flag:''' The Pathfinder flag is made from one of several materials,   cotton bunting, rayon, or nylon. The flag is divided through the center both vertically and horizontally making four equal parts. The background colors are royal blue and white alternately sewed together with the upper left hand comer being royal blue. The Pathfinder emblem is centered in the heart of the background. The colors are descriptive of the purposes and ideals of Pathfindering. White means purity, blue means loyalty, red reminds us of the shed blood of Christ (sacrifice), and gold means excellence. The symbols also have meanings. The shield is the protection of God, the sword is his word, the Bible, and the triangle represents completeness. Completeness of the Godhead (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), and completeness of the three parts of education (Mental, Physical, and Spiritual).]]
|-
|[[Image:Ayflag.jpg|thumb|300px|'''AY Flag:''' The background is red and white, red symbolizing the blood of Christ and white representing purity. In the center, there is a logo that has AY which means Adventist Youth and it has three angels meaning the 3 angels message.]]
|[[Image:Christian_flag.svg|thumb|300px|'''Christian Flag:''' The &quot;Christian Flag&quot; is a white flag with a blue canton and a red cross in it. It was designed by Charles Overton in 1897 to represent Protestants of all denominations.  The cross symbolizes the crucifixion of Christ.]]

==2. Know how to display the national flag with two other flags under the following situations: &lt;br&gt;a. Camp out/camporee &lt;br&gt;b. Fair &lt;br&gt;c. Pathfinder Day program &lt;br&gt;d. Parade==

=== a. Camp out/Camporee. ===
If your camp has three flag poles than the National Flag should be post at the center. When there are only two flag poles than the National Flag should be post at the right. This regulations works to in the time of Camporee.&lt;BR&gt;

The order of precedence for flag is:&lt;BR&gt;
1. The National Flag of Indonesia. Sang Merah Putih&lt;BR&gt; 
2. The Pathfinder Club Flag.&lt;BR&gt;
3. The Adventist Youth Flag.&lt;BR&gt;

The order of placement for flag in the time of Camporee is:&lt;BR&gt;
1. The Pathfinder Club Flag placed on the right pole.&lt;BR&gt;
2. The National Flag of Indonesia placed on the center pole and must be higher than the other flags.&lt;BR&gt;
3. The Adventist Youth Flag placed on the left pole.
=== b. Fair. ===
The above regulation works to in all kinds of Fair in Pathfinder Club such as Pathfinder Fair and Adventurer Fair except if the Fair were held in an auditorium.

==3. Demonstrate how to fold and salute your national flag. Mention when and how it should be displayed. ==
===Folding===

===Flag Protocol===

==4. Explain the meaning of and reason for the National Anthem, and recite the words from memory. ==

==5. Give the rights and responsibilities of a citizen of your country. ==

===Rights===

===Responsibilities===

==6. Have an interview with a local, regional, or national official of your country, and learn about his duties. ==
It is generally easier to get a local official to agree to an interview, though it is often more exciting to interview a more prominent person.  The interview can be accomplished during a club meeting, and multiple Pathfinders can ask questions.  Invite your guest well ahead of time, and make sure everyone in the club is on time.  A visit by an official would be a very good reason to have everyone in the club wear their class A uniforms.  If desired, you can make up several questions ahead of time, writing them on index cards, and distributing them to the members of your club.  But do not be so rigid as to not allow them to ask spontaneous questions.  Having questions prepared ahead of time on index cards are a good way to get things rolling.  Here are some suggested questions:
* Could you describe a typical day at work?
* What is the most difficult part of your job?
* What is the most satisfying aspect of your job?
* To whom do you report?
* How did you get your position?  Were you elected, appointed, or hired?
* How should a young person prepare for a life of public service?

==7. Write a one-page essay or give a two-minute oral report about a famous person in your country. Mention what he has done to gain his recognition. ==
This would be an excellent opportunity to present a worship during the opening exercises of a regular club meeting.  Encourage your Pathfinder to choose a person they are personally interested in.  If they cannot think of anyone themselves, have a list of suggested persons at hand and encourage them to choose from the list.  Famous people might be historical figures, politicians, actors, sports stars, or anyone else.  It would be preferable to choose a person who has been a positive influence on the country.

Although the requirement asks that you &quot;mention what ''he'' has done to gain ''his'' recognition,&quot; this should not be interpreted as excluding women.  Men are not the ''only'' famous people in a country.

==8. Do one of the following: ==
===a. Make a list of ten famous quotations from leaders of your country.===

===b. Make a list of ten famous historic places in your country. ===

===c. Make a list of ten famous historic events in your country.===

==9. Describe what you can do as a citizen to help your church and country. ==
The best way to help either your church or your country is by ''getting involved''.  Edmund Burke, an English philosopher summed this up when he said ''&quot;The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.&quot;''

In your church, this means that you will show up for services on a regular basis.  It also means you will support it with your tithes and offering, show up for business meetings, and not wait to be asked before you volunteer your services.  If you see something that needs done, ''do it.''  If you do not have the skill to do it, or you think that you need permission first, talk to your pastor, an elder, deacon, or deaconess.  Find your ministry!

For your country, it is much the same.  Show up for public meetings, stay informed about the issues of the day, vote if you are eligible, and pay your taxes fairly and promptly.

==10. Go through the steps of an individual acquiring citizenship in the country and learn how this is done. ==

==11. Know how to explain the process of government in your country. ==

==12. Explain the meaning of this statement Jesus made in Matthew 22:21: &quot;Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's. ==
This verse teaches that governmental authority is to be respected, as long as it does not conflict with the moral obligations of being a Christian.  Government serves a holy purpose; preserving social order, promoting the well-being of its citizens, and protecting their safety.  If you believe that this does not apply today because you see the government as corrupt, you are urged to research the Roman government of the first century A.D. when these words were spoken by Jesus.  Was Herod corrupt?  Was Pilate just?

==13. Explain why laws are established in your country. ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are supervised learning methods used for classification and regression tasks that originated from statistical learning theory &lt;ref name = &quot;Vapnik1998&quot;&gt; V. Vapnik, Statistical learning theory. Wiley, New Tork (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;. As a classification method, SVM is a global classification model that generates non-overlapping partitions and usually employs all attributes. The entity space is partitioned in a single pass, so that flat and linear partitions are generated. SVMs are based on maximum margin linear discriminants, and are similar to probabilistic approaches, but do not consider the dependencies among attributes &lt;ref name = &quot;Zaki2010&quot;&gt; M. J. Zaki and W. Meira Jr. Fundamentals of Data Mining Algorithms. Cambridge University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;.


Traditional Neural Network approaches have suffered difficulties with generalization, producing models which overfit the data as a consequence of the optimization algorithms used for parameter selection and the statistical measures used to select the best model. SVMs have been gaining popularity due to many attractive features and promising empirical performance. They are based on the Structural Risk Minimization (SRM) principle &lt;ref name = &quot;Gunn1997&quot;&gt; S. R. Gunn, M. Brown and K. M. Bossley, Network performance assessment for neurofuzzy data modeling. Intelligent Data Analysis, volume 1208 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science (1997), 313.&lt;/ref&gt; have shown to be superior to the traditional principle of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) employed by conventional Neural Networks. ERM minimizes the error on the training data, while SRM minimizes an upper bound on the expected risk. This gives SRM greater generalization ability, which is the goal in statistical learning &lt;ref name = &quot;Gunn1998&quot;&gt; S. R. Gunn. Support vector machines for classification and regression.Tech. rep., University of Sothampton, UK, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;. According to &lt;ref name = &quot;Duda2000&quot;&gt; R. O. Duda, P. E. Hart and D. G. Stork, Pattern Classification. Ed.Wiley-Interscience, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;, SVMs rely on preprocessing the data to represent patterns in a high dimension, typically much higher than the original feature space. Data from two categories can always be separated by a hyperplane when an appropriate nonlinear mapping to a sufficiently high dimension is used.


A classification task usually involves training and test sets which consist of data instances. Each instance in the training set contains one target value (class label) and several attributes (features). The goal of a classifier is to produce a model able to predict target values of data instances in the testing set, for which only the attributes are known. Without loss of generality, the classification problem can be viewed as a two-class problem in which one's objective is to separate the two classes by a function induced from available examples. The goal is to produce a classifier that generalizes well, i.e. that works well on unseen examples. The below picture is an example of a situation in which various linear classifiers can separate the data. However, only one maximizes the distance between itself and the nearest example of each class (i.e. the margin) and for that is called the optimal separating hyperplane. It is intuitively expected that this classifier generalizes better than the other options &lt;ref name=&quot;Gunn1998&quot;/&gt;. The basic idea of SVM classifier uses this approach, i.e. to choose the hyperplane that has the maximum margin.

[[File:SVM Example of Hyperplanes.png]]

Figure 1: Example of separating hyperplanes

== Algorithm ==
Let ''D'' be a classification dataset with ''n'' points in a ''d''-dimensional space ''D = {(x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)}'', with ''i = 1, 2, ..., n'' and let there be only two class labels such that ''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is either +1 or -1. A hyperplane ''h(x)'' gives a linear discriminant function in ''d'' dimensions and splits the original space into two half-spaces:

::&lt;math&gt;h(x) = w^Tx + b = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_dx_d + b\,&lt;/math&gt;, 

:where ''w'' is a ''d''-dimensional weight vector and ''b'' is a scalar bias. Points on the hyperplane have ''h(x) = 0'', i.e. the hyperplane is defined by all points for which ''w&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;x = -b''.


According to &lt;ref name = &quot;Zaki2010&quot;/&gt;, if the dataset is linearly separable, a separating hyperplane can be found such that for all points with label -1, ''h(x) &lt; 0'' and for all points labeled +1, ''h(x) &gt; 0''. In this case, ''h(x)'' serves as a linear classifier or linear discriminant that predicts the class for any point.  Moreover, the weight vector ''w'' is orthogonal to the hyperplane, therefore giving the direction that is normal to it, whereas the bias ''b'' fixes the offset of the hyperplane in the ''d''-dimensional space.

Given a separating hyperplane ''h(x) = 0'', it is possible to calculate the distance between each point ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the hyperplane by:

::&lt;math&gt;\delta_i = \tfrac{y_ih(x_i)}{||w||}&lt;/math&gt;


The margin of the linear classifier is defined as the minimum distance of all ''n'' points to the separating hyperplane.

::&lt;math&gt;\delta^*=\min_{x_i}\{\tfrac{y_ih(x_i)}{||w||}\}&lt;/math&gt;


All points (vectors ''x&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') that achieve this minimum distance are called the support vectors for the linear classifier. In other words, a support vector is a point that lies precisely on the margin of the classifying hyperplane.


In a canonical representation of the hyperplane, for each support vector ''x&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' with label ''y&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' we have that &lt;math&gt;y^*_ih(x^*_i) = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, for any point that is not a support vector, we have that &lt;math&gt;y_ih(x_i) &gt; 1\,&lt;/math&gt;, since, by definition, it must be farther from the hyperplane than a support vector. Therefore we have that &lt;math&gt;y_ih(x_i) \geq 1,\ \forall x_i \in D&lt;/math&gt;.


The fundamental idea behind SVMs is to choose the hyperplane with the maximum margin, i.e. the optimal canonical hyperplane. To do this, one needs to find the weight vector ''w'' and the bias ''b'' that yield the maximum margin among all possible separating hyperplanes, that is, the hyperplane that maximizes &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{||w||}&lt;/math&gt;. The problem then becomes that of solving a convex minimization problem (notice that instead of maximizing the margin &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{||w||}.&lt;/math&gt;, one can obtain an equivalent formulation of minimizing &lt;math&gt;||w||&lt;/math&gt;) with linear constraints, as follows:

:; Objective Function : &lt;math&gt;min \tfrac{||w||^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;


:; Linear Constraints : &lt;math&gt;y_ih(x_i) \geq 1,\ \forall x_i \in D&lt;/math&gt;


:This minimization problem can be solved using the ''Lagrange multiplier'' method, which introduces a Lagrange multiplier α for each constraint:

::&lt;math&gt;\alpha_i(y_ih(x)-1) = 0\ \text{with}\ \alpha_i \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;


This method states that ''α&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 0'' for all points that are at a distance larger than &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{||w||}&lt;/math&gt; from the hyperplane, and only for those points that are exactly at the margin, i.e. the support vectors, ''α&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0''. The weight vector of the classifier is obtained as a linear combination of the support vectors, while the bias is the average of the biases obtained from each support vector &lt;ref name=&quot;Zaki2010&quot;/&gt;.


SVMs can handle linearly non-separable points, where the classes overlap to some extent so that a perfect separation is not possible, by introducing slack variables ''ε&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for each point ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' in ''D''. If ''0 ≤ ε&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1'', the point is still correctly classified. Otherwise, if ''ε&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 1'', the point is misclassified. So the goal of the classification becomes that of finding the hyperplane (''w'' and ''b'') with the maximum margin that also minimizes the sum of slack variables. A methodology similar to that described above is necessary to find the weight vector ''w'' and the bias ''b''.


SVMs can also solve problems with non-linear decision boundaries. The main idea is to map the original ''d''-dimensional space into a ''d’''-dimensional space (''d’ &gt; d''), where the points can possibly be linearly separated. Given the original dataset ''D = {x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}'' with ''i = 1,...,n'' and the transformation function Φ, a new dataset is obtained in the transformation space ''D&lt;sub&gt;Φ&lt;/sub&gt; = {Φ(x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;), y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}'' with ''i = 1,...,n''. After the linear decision surface is found in the ''d’''-dimensional space, it is mapped back to the non-linear surface in the original ''d''-dimensional space &lt;ref name=&quot;Zaki2010&quot;/&gt;. To obtain ''w'' and ''b'', ''Φ(x)'' needn't be computed in isolation. The only operation required in the transformed space is the inner product ''Φ(x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;Φ(x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;)'', which is defined with the kernel function (''K'') between ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''. Kernels commonly used with SVMs include:

:* the polynomial kernel:
::&lt;math&gt;K(x_i,x_j) = (x_i^Tx_j+1)^q&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the degree of the polynomial


:* the gaussian kernel:
::&lt;math&gt;K(x_i,x_j) = e^{-\frac{||x_i-x_j||^2}{2\sigma^2}}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the spread or standard deviation.


:* the gaussian radial basis function (RBF):  
::&lt;math&gt;K(x_i,x_j)=e^{-\gamma||x_i-x_j||^2},\, \gamma\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;


:* the Laplace Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel:
::&lt;math&gt;K(x_i,x_j)=e^{-\gamma||x_i-x_j||},\, \gamma\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;


:* the hyperbolic tangent kernel:
::&lt;math&gt;K(x_i,x_j)=tanh(x_i^Tx_j+offset)&lt;/math&gt;


:* the sigmoid kernel:
::&lt;math&gt;K(x_i,x_j)=tanh(ax_i^Tx_j+offset)&lt;/math&gt;


:* the Bessel function of the first kind kernel:
::&lt;math&gt;K(x_i,x_j)=\left( \tfrac{Bessel_{v+1}^n(\sigma||x_i-x_j||)}   {(||x_i-x_j||)^{-n(v+1)}}  \right)&lt;/math&gt;


:* the ANOVA radial basis kernel:
::&lt;math&gt;K(x_i,x_j)= \left(  \sum_{k=1}^n e^{-\sigma(x_i^k - x_j^k)^2}     \right)^d&lt;/math&gt;


:* the linear splines kernel in one dimension:
::&lt;math&gt;K(x_i,x_j)=1+x_ix_jmin(x_i,x_j)-\tfrac{x_i+x_j}{2}min(x_i,x_j)^2 + \tfrac{min(x_i,x_j)^3}{3}&lt;/math&gt;


According to &lt;ref name=&quot;Karatzoglou2006&quot;/&gt;, the Gaussian and Laplace RBF and Bessel kernels are general-purpose kernels used when there is no prior knowledge about the data. The linear kernel is useful when dealing with large sparse data vectors as is usually the case in text categorization. The polynomial kernel is popular in image processing, and the sigmoid kernel is mainly used as a proxy for neural networks. The splines and ANOVA RBF kernels typically perform well in regression problems.

===e1071 package===

The e1071 package was the first implementation of SVM in R. The ''svm()'' function provides an interface to ''libsvm'' &lt;ref name = &quot;Chang2001&quot;&gt; C. Chang and C. Lin (2001). &quot;libsvm: A Library for Support Vector Machines.&quot; URL http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm.&lt;/ref&gt;, complemented by visualization and tuning functions. ''libsvm'' is a fast and easy-to-use implementation of the most popular SVM formulation of classification (C and &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;), and includes the most common kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF, and sigmoid). Multi-class classification is provided using the one-against-one voting scheme. It also includes the computation of decision and probability values for predictions, shrinking heuristics during the fitting process, class weighting in the classification mode, handling of sparse data, and cross-validation.

The R implementation is based on the S3 class mechanisms. It basically provides a training function with standard and formula interfaces, and a ''predict()'' method. In addition, a ''plot()'' method for visualizing data, support vectors, and decision boundaries is provided. Hyperparameter tuning is done using the ''tune()'' framework, which performs a grid search over specified parameter ranges.

====Installing and Starting the e1071 Package====

To install e1071 package in R, type 

     install.packages('e1071',dependencies=TRUE)

and to start to use the package, type 

     library(e1071)

====Main Functions in the e1071 Package for Training, Testing, and Visualizing====

Some ''e1071'' package functions are very important in any classification process using SVM in R, and thus will be described here.


The first function is ''svm()'', which is used to train a support vector machine. Some import parameters include:

:* '''data''': an optional data frame containing the variables in the model. If this option is used, the parameters x and y described below, aren't necessary;

:* '''x''': a data matrix, a vector, or a sparse matrix that represents the instances of the dataset and their respective properties. Rows represent the instances and columns represent the properties;

:* '''y''': a response vector with one label for each row (instance) of x;

:* '''type''': sets how svm() will work. The possible values for classification are: C, nu and one (for novelty detection);

:* '''kernel''': defines the kernel used in training and prediction. The options are: linear, polynomial, radial basis and sigmoid;

:* '''degree''': parameter needed if the kernel is polynomial (default: 3);

:* '''gamma''': parameter needed for all types of kernels except linear (default: 1/(data dimension));

:* '''coef0''': parameter needed for polynomial and sigmoid kernels (default: 0);

:* '''cost''': cost of constraint violation (default: 1). This is the ‘C’-constant of the regularization term in the Lagrange formulation;

:* '''cross''': specifies the cross-validation. A k &gt; 0 is necessary. In this case, the training data is performed to assess the quality of the model: the accuracy rate for classification;

:* '''probability''': logical indicating whether the model should allow for probability predictions. 


An example of ''svm()'' usage is given below:

     library(MASS)
     data(cats)
     model  &lt;- svm(Sex~., data = cats)


The first two commands specify the usage of the cats dataset, which contains 144 instances, 2 numerical attributes for each instance (&quot;Bwt&quot;  and  &quot;Hwt&quot;), and the class for each instance (attribute &quot;Sex&quot;). The instance class can be &quot;F&quot;, for female, or &quot;M&quot;, for male. In the third command, the parameter &quot;Sex~.&quot; indicates the attribute (column) of the dataset to be used as instance classes.

For information on the parameters of the model and on the number of support vectors, type:

     print(model)
     summary(model)


The result of the summary command is shown below:

   Call:
   svm(formula = Sex ~ ., data = cats)
   
   Parameters:
      SVM-Type:  C-classification 
    SVM-Kernel:  radial 
          cost:  1 
         gamma:  0.5 
   
   Number of Support Vectors:  84
   
    ( 39 45 )
   
   
   Number of Classes:  2 
   
   Levels: 
    F M


To see the built model with a scatter plot of the input, the ''plot()'' function can be used. This function optionally draws a filled contour plot of the class regions. The main parameters of this function are listed below:

:* '''model''': an object of class svm data, which results from the svm() function;

:* '''data''': the data to visualize. It should be the same data used for building the model in the svm() function;

:* '''symbolPalette''', '''svSymbol''', '''dataSymbol''', and '''colorPalette''': these parameters control the colors and symbols used to represent support vectors and the other data points.


The following command will produce the below graph, in which support vectors are shown as ‘X’, true classes are highlighted through symbol color, and predicted class regions are visualized using colored background.

     plot(model,cats)

[[File:SvmPlot.jpg]]

The ''predict()'' function predicts values based on a model trained by svm. For a classification problem, it returns a vector of predicted labels. Detailed information about its usage can be obtained with the following command.

     help(predict.svm)

Let us first divide the cats dataset into a train and a test set:

     index &lt;- 1:nrow(cats)
     testindex &lt;- sample(index, trunc(length(index)/3))
     testset &lt;- cats[testindex,]
     trainset &lt;- cats[-testindex,]

Now we run the model again using the train set and predict classes using the test set in order to verify if the model has good generalization.

     model &lt;- svm(Sex~., data = trainset)
     prediction &lt;- predict(model, testset[,-1])

The -1 is because the dependent variable, Sex, is in column number 1.

A cross-tabulation of the true versus the predicted values yields (the confusion matrix):

     tab &lt;- table(pred = prediction, true = testset[,1])

If you type tab, you will see the confusion matrix like is shown below:

       true
   pred  F  M
      F 10  8
      M  6 24

With this information, it is possible to compute the sensitivity, the specificity and the precision of the model to the test set.

Model accuracy rates can be computed using the ''classAgreement()'' function:

     classAgreement(tab)

The ''tune()'' function can be used to tune hyperparameters of statistical methods using a grid search over the supplied parameter ranges.

     tuned &lt;- tune.svm(Sex~., data = trainset, gamma = 10^(-6:-1), cost = 10^(1:2))
     summary(tuned)

These commands will list the best parameters, the best performance, and details of the tested parameter values, as shown below.

== Case Study ==
In this section we use a dataset to breast cancer diagnostic and apply svm in it. The svm model will be able to discriminate benign and malignant tumors. 

=== The DataSet ===

The dataset can be downloaded at [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29]. In this dataset there are 569 instances and 32 attributes for each instance. The first attribute is the identification of instance, the second is the label for the instance class, which can be M (malignant tumor) or B (benign tumor). The following 30 attributes are real-valued input features that are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. Finally, there are 357 benign instances and 212 malignant instances in dataset.

In order to read the dataset, after downloading it and saving it, type in R:

&lt;pre&gt;
dataset &lt;- read.csv('/home/myprofile/wdbc.data',head=FALSE)
&lt;/pre&gt;

'/home/myprofile/' is the path where the dataset was saved.

=== Preparing the DataSet ===

Let us now divide at random the dataset in two subsets, one with about 70% of the instances to training, and another with around the remaining 30% of instances to testing:

&lt;pre&gt;
index &lt;- 1:nrow(dataset)

testindex &lt;- sample(index, trunc(length(index)*30/100))

testset &lt;- dataset[testindex,]

trainset &lt;- dataset[-testindex,]

&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Choosing Parameters ===

Now, we will use the '''tune()''' function to do a grid search over the supplied parameter ranges ('''C''' - cost, '''&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;''' - gamma), using the train set. The range to gamma parameter is between 0.000001 and 0.1. For cost parameter the range is from 0.1 until 10. 


It's important to understanding the influence of this two parameters, because the accuracy of an SVM model is largely dependent on the selection them. For example, if '''C''' is too large, we have a high penalty for nonseparable points and we may store many support vectors and overfit. If it is too small, we may have underfitting &lt;ref name = &quot;Alpaydin2004&quot;&gt; E. Alpaydin. Introduction to machine learning. MIT Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;.


Notice that there aren't names for the columns (attributes) in the database . Then, R considers default names for them, as such V1, to the first column, V2 to the second and so on. It's possible to check this typing:

&lt;pre&gt;
names(dataset)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then, as the class label is the second column of the dataset, the first parameter to '''tune()''' function will be ''V2'':

&lt;pre&gt;
tuned &lt;- tune.svm(V2~., data = trainset, gamma = 10^(-6:-1), cost = 10^(-1:1))
&lt;/pre&gt;

The results are showed with the following command:

&lt;pre&gt;
summary(tuned)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;

18 1e-01 10.0 0.05532051 0.04110686
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Training The Model ===

In order to build a svm model to predict breast cancer using '''C=10''' and '''gamma=0.001''', which were the best values according the '''tune()''' function run before, type:

&lt;pre&gt;
model  &lt;- svm(V2~., data = trainset, kernel=&quot;radial&quot;, gamma=0.001, cost=10) 
&lt;/pre&gt;

To see the results of the model, as the number of support vectors is necessary type:

&lt;pre&gt;
summary(model)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The result follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
Call:
svm(formula = V2 ~ ., data = trainset, kernel = &quot;radial&quot;, gamma = 0.001, cost = 10)


Parameters:
   SVM-Type:  C-classification 
 SVM-Kernel:  radial 
       cost:  10 
      gamma:  0.001 

Number of Support Vectors:  79

 ( 39 40 )


Number of Classes:  2 

Levels: 
 B M

&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Testing the Model ===

Now we run the model again the test set to predict classes.

&lt;pre&gt;
prediction &lt;- predict(model, testset[,-2])
&lt;/pre&gt;

The -2 is because the label column to intance classes, V2, is in the second column.

To produce the confusion matrix type:

&lt;pre&gt;
tab &lt;- table(pred = prediction, true = testset[,2])
&lt;/pre&gt;

The confusion matrix is:

&lt;pre&gt;
    true
pred   B   M
   B 103   6
   M   0  61
&lt;/pre&gt;

This means that there are 103 benign instances in test set and all of them were predicted as benign instances. On the other hand, there are 67 malign instances in test set, 61 were predicted rightly and 6 as benign instances.

Let:

* TP: true positive, i.e. malign instances predicted rightly
* FP: false positive, i.e. benign instances predicted as malign
* TN: true negative, i.e. benign instances predicted rightly
* |N|: total of benign instances
* |P|: total of malign instances


&lt;small&gt;
&lt;math&gt; sensitivity=\frac{TP}{|P|} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; specificity=\frac{TN}{|N|} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; precision=\frac{TP}{TP+FP} &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;

For this problem we have:

&lt;small&gt;
&lt;math&gt; sensitivity=\frac{61}{61+6}=0.91 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; specificity=\frac{103}{103}=1 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; precision=\frac{61}{61+0}=1 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;

The classification results are suitable.

== Fibrous Plants used by the Luisenos Indians ==

=== Dogbane (Indianhemp) ===

{{wikipedia|Apocynum_cannabinum}}{{commons|Apocynum_cannabinum}} 
'''''Dogbane is poisonous to dogs and humans, wash your hands after handling.'''''

The best fiber is made from dogbane or Indian hemp, Apocynum cannabinum, a perennial plant with annual stems. The inner bark furnishes the fiber. Sometimes the outer covering is scraped off and the inner bark then removed from the stalk; or the bark is pulled off entirely, and soaked in boiling water, after which the outer covering easily separates from the fiber. In either case the fiber is rolled into a ball, and made into twine by rolling it between the palm of the hand and the bare thigh.

=== Milkweed ===

{{wikipedia|Asclepias_eriocarpa}}

A milkweed, Asclepias eriocarpa, furnishes a light-colored fiber, but it is not so durable as that obtained from dogbane. The fiber is separated from the pulp by soaking the stems in boiling water; or, late in the season, when the pulp has decayed, it may be separated by merely basting the stems. It is then made into a ball, which is afterwards made into twine in the same manner as dogbane fiber.

=== Common Nettle ===

{{wikipedia|Stinging_nettle}}

The common nettle, Urtica holosericea, also furnishes a fiber, but it is little esteemed.

=== Miscellaneous Information ===

The twine made from the plants mentioned is usually two-ply, but three-ply and four-ply twine is also made. Bowstrings are made from such twine, generally of dogbane (Indianhemp).

A large-meshed net for carrying bulky or heavy articles, ikut, is also made from twine. This carrying-net has a cord attached that passes across the forehead, which bears part of the weight of the contents. A net-work sack for carrying acorns, kawish, was formerly made, the mesh being sufficiently small to prevent the acorns from falling through. The mouth of this sack might be tied and the sack itself placed in the large-meshed carrying net, or it could be used alone, as it had a cord attached to it in the same manner as the carrying net. One we have seen would probably hold about a bushel. Other net-work sacks with a still finer mesh are said to have been made at one time. In these small seeds were carried.

A long net, yulapish, for use at rabbit drives, was occasionally made. These were considered very valuable, much time being consumed in their manufacture. A draw-net for catching rabbits and jackrabbits was also made. This was placed in their runs, or stretched between bushes where they would be likely to pass. An endeavor was then made to drive them towards the nets. A small fine-meshed dip-net was made for catching a very small fish found in streams. A large dip-net was made for sea fishing.

The front apron worn by women was also formerly made from this cordage, sometimes of net-work and sometimes of loose strings suspended to a cord tied around the waist.

Slings, pivanlish, were also made from twine, and it was used for many other purposes. 

=== Yucca mohavetisis ===

{{wikipedia|Yucca}}

The fiber of Yucca Mohavetisis, so much used by the Cahuillas, is seldom employed by the Luisenos, though a fish line was formerly made from it. The leaves are soaked in water until the pulpy part decays, when they are basted to separate the fiber.


=== Wavyleaf Soap Plant ===


{{wikipedia|Chlorogalum_pomeridianum}}

From the fibers covering the bulb of the wavyleaf soap plant (Chlorogalum pomeridianum), a small brush, alukut, is made. This is used, in pounding acorns, to sweep up the scattered meal, and to brush it from the mortar.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

== The Eclat Algorithm == 
The Eclat algorithm is used to perform itemset mining. Itemset mining let us find frequent patterns in data like if a consumer buys milk, he also buys bread. This type of pattern is called association rules and is used in many application domains.

The basic idea for the eclat algorithm is use tidset intersections to compute the support of a candidate itemset avoiding the generation of subsets that does not exist in the prefix tree.

=== Algorithm ===


The Eclat algorithm is defined recursively. The initial call uses all the single items with their tidsets. In each recursive call, the function IntersectTidsets verifies each itemset-tidset pair &lt;math&gt;\left\langle {X,t(X)} \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; with all the others pairs &lt;math&gt;\left\langle {Y,t(Y)} \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; to generate new candidates &lt;math&gt;N_{XY}&lt;/math&gt;. If the new candidate is frequent, it is added to the set &lt;math&gt;P_{X}&lt;/math&gt;. Then, recursively, it finds all the frequent itemsets in the &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; branch. The algorithm searches in a DFS manner to find all the frequent sets.

=== Implementation ===

The eclat algorithm can be found in the arule package of R system.

    * R package: '''arules'''
    * Method: '''eclat'''
    * Documentation : [http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/arules/ arules package]


'''''Usage''''' 

 eclat(data, parameter = NULL, control = NULL)

'''''Arguments'''''

;'''data''' :object of class transactions or any data structure which can be coerced into transactions (e.g., binary matrix, data.frame).

;'''parameter''' :object of class ECparameter or named list (default values are: support 0.1 and maxlen 5)

;'''control''' :object of class ECcontrol or named list for algorithmic controls.

'''''Value'''''

Returns an object of class itemsets

 

'''''Example'''''

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
data(&quot;Adult&quot;)

## Mine itemsets with minimum support of 0.1.
itemsets &lt;- eclat(Adult, parameter = list(supp = 0.1, maxlen = 15))
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Visualization === 

The arules package implements some visualization methods for itemsets, which are the return type for the eclat algorithm. Here are some examples:

'''''Example 1'''''

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
data(&quot;Adult&quot;) 

## Mine frequent itemsets with Eclat.
fsets &lt;- eclat(Adult, parameter = list(supp = 0.5))

## Display the 5 itemsets with the highest support.
fsets.top5 &lt;- SORT(fsets)1:5?
inspect(fsets.top5)

## Get the itemsets as a list
as(items(fsets.top5), &quot;list&quot;)

## Get the itemsets as a binary matrix
as(items(fsets.top5), &quot;matrix&quot;)

## Get the itemsets as a sparse matrix, a ngCMatrix from package Matrix.
## Warning: for efficiency reasons, the ngCMatrix you get is transposed
as(items(fsets.top5), &quot;ngCMatrix&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

'''''Example 2'''''
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;

## Create transaction data set.
data &lt;- list(
  c(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;),
  c(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;),
  c(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;d&quot;),
  c(&quot;b&quot;,&quot;e&quot;),
  c(&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;e&quot;),
  c(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;e&quot;),
  c(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;c&quot;),
  c(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;d&quot;),
  c(&quot;c&quot;,&quot;e&quot;),
  c(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;e&quot;)
)

t &lt;- as(data, &quot;transactions&quot;)

## Mine itemsets with tidLists.
f &lt;- eclat(data, parameter = list(support = 0, tidLists = TRUE))

## Get dimensions of the tidLists.
dim(tidLists(f))

## Coerce tidLists to list.
as(tidLists(f), &quot;list&quot;)

## Inspect visually.
image(tidLists(f))

##Show the Frequent itemsets and respectives supports
inspect(f)

&lt;/source&gt;

=== Use Case ===
To see some real example of the use of the Eclat algorithm it will be used some data from the [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=06616212-0356-46A0-8DA2-EEBC53A68034&amp;displaylang=en northwind] database. The northwind database is freely available for download and represents data from an enterprise. In this example it will be used the table ''order details'' from the database. The order details table is used to relate the orders with products (in a n to n relationship). The Eclat algorithm will be used to find frequent patterns from this data to see if there are any products that are  bought together.

====Scenario====
Given the data from the order details table from the northwind database, find all the frequent itemsets with support = 0.1 and length of at least 2.

====Input Data====
The order details table has the fields:

;ID: primary key
;Order ID: foreign key from table Orders
;Product ID:foreign key from table Products
;Quantity: the quantity bought
;Discount: the discount offered
;Unit Price: the unit price of the product


To use the data, some pre-processing is necessary. The table may have many rows that belongs to the same order, so the table was converted in a way that all the rows for one order became only one row in the new table containing the product id's of the products belonging to that order. The fields ID, order id, quantity, discount and unit price was discarded. The data was saved in a txt file called ''northwind-orders.txt''. The file was scripted in a way ready to be loaded as a list object in R.

====Implementation====
''To run the example the package arules need to be loaded in R.''

First, the data is loaded in a list object in R

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
## 1041 transactions is loaded, the listing below was shortened
## some duplicates transactions was introduced to produce some results for the algorithm
data = list(
 c(&quot;2&quot;,&quot;3&quot;,&quot;4&quot;,&quot;6&quot;,&quot;7&quot;,&quot;8&quot;,&quot;10&quot;,&quot;12&quot;,&quot;13&quot;,&quot;14&quot;,&quot;16&quot;,&quot;20&quot;,&quot;23&quot;,&quot;32&quot;,&quot;39&quot;,&quot;41&quot;,&quot;46&quot;,&quot;52&quot;,&quot;55&quot;,&quot;60&quot;,&quot;64&quot;,&quot;66&quot;,&quot;73&quot;,&quot;75&quot;,&quot;77&quot;),
 c(&quot;11&quot;,&quot;42&quot;,&quot;72&quot;),
 c(&quot;14&quot;,&quot;51&quot;),
 c(&quot;41&quot;,&quot;51&quot;,&quot;65&quot;),
 c(&quot;22&quot;,&quot;57&quot;,&quot;65&quot;),
 ...)

&lt;/source&gt;


Second, the eclat algorithm is used.
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
itemsets &lt;- eclat(data, parameter = list(support = 0.1, minlen=2, tidLists = TRUE, target=&quot;frequent itemsets&quot;))
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
parameter specification:
 tidLists support minlen maxlen            target   ext
     TRUE     0.1      2      5 frequent itemsets FALSE

algorithmic control:
 sparse sort verbose
      7   -2    TRUE

eclat - find frequent item sets with the eclat algorithm
version 2.6 (2004.08.16)         (c) 2002-2004   Christian Borgelt
create itemset ... 
set transactions ...[78 item(s), 1041 transaction(s)] done [0.00s].
sorting and recoding items ... [3 item(s)] done [0.00s].
creating bit matrix ... [3 row(s), 1041 column(s)] done [0.00s].
writing  ... [4 set(s)] done [0.00s].
Creating S4 object  ... done [0.00s].
&lt;/pre&gt; 


====Output Data====

The itemsets object holds the output of the execution of the eclat algorithm. As can be seen above, 4 sets was generated. To see the results it can be used:

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
inspect(itemsets)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
  items   support
1 {11,           
   42,           
   72}  0.1940442
2 {42,           
   72}  0.1940442
3 {11,           
   42}  0.1940442
4 {11,           
   72}  0.1959654
&lt;/pre&gt;


====Analysis====

As can be seen above, there are 4 frequent itemsets as result of the eclat algorithm. This output was induced by the replication of the transaction {11, 42, 72} many times in the data. This result shows that the tuples {11,42,72},{42,72} and {11,42} has a support of 19,40%; and the tuple {11,72} has a support of 19,60%.

The product id's 11, 42 and 72 represents the products ''Queso Cabrales'', ''Singaporean Hokkien Fried Mee'' and ''Mozzarella di Giovanni'', respectively. So, the output of the eclat algorithm suggests a strong frequent shop pattern of buying this items together.

===Variations===

====PPV, PrePost, and FIN Algorithm====
These three algorithms were propsed by Deng et al &lt;ref name=Deng2010 /&gt; &lt;ref name=Deng2012 /&gt; &lt;ref name=Deng2014 /&gt;, and are based on three novel data structures called Node-list &lt;ref name=Deng2010 /&gt;, N-list &lt;ref name=Deng2012 /&gt;, and Nodeset &lt;ref name=Deng2014 /&gt; respectively for facilitating the mining process of frequent itemsets. They are sets of nodes in a FP-tree with each node encoding with pre-order traversal and post-order traversal. Compared with Node-lists, N-lists and Nodesets are more efficient. This causes the efficiency of PrePost &lt;ref name=Deng2012 /&gt; and FIN &lt;ref name=Deng2014 /&gt; is higher than that of PPV &lt;ref name=Deng2010 /&gt;. See &lt;ref name=Deng2010 /&gt; &lt;ref name=Deng2012 /&gt; &lt;ref name=Deng2014 /&gt; for more details.

This section is intended to review algebraic manipulation. It is important to understand algebra in order to do calculus. If you have a good knowledge of algebra, you should probably just skim this section to be sure you are familiar with the ideas.

==Rules of arithmetic and algebra==
The following laws are true for all a, b, and c, whether a, b, and c are numbers, variables, functions, or more complex expressions involving numbers, variable and/or functions.

===  Addition===
* Commutative Law: &lt;math&gt;a+b=b+a \,&lt;/math&gt;.
* Associative Law:  &lt;math&gt;(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)\,&lt;/math&gt;.
* Additive Identity: &lt;math&gt;a+0=a\,&lt;/math&gt;.
* Additive Inverse: &lt;math&gt;a+(-a)=0\,&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Subtraction=== 
*Definition:  &lt;math&gt;a-b = a+(-b)\,&lt;/math&gt;.
=== Multiplication=== 
*Commutative law:  &lt;math&gt;a\times b=b\times a&lt;/math&gt;.
*Associative law:  &lt;math&gt;(a\times b)\times c=a\times (b\times c)\,&lt;/math&gt;.
*Multiplicative identity: &lt;math&gt;a\times 1=a\,&lt;/math&gt;.
*Multiplicative inverse: &lt;math&gt;a\times \frac{1}{a}=1&lt;/math&gt;, whenever &lt;math&gt;a \neq 0\,&lt;/math&gt;
*Distributive law:  &lt;math&gt;a\times (b+c)=(a\times b)+(a\times c)\,&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Division=== 
*Definition: &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b}=a\times \frac{1}{b}&lt;/math&gt;, whenever &lt;math&gt;b \neq 0\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Let's look at an example to see how these rules are used in practice.

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{(x+2)(x+3)}{x+3}&lt;/math&gt;
| = &lt;math&gt;\left[(x+2)\times (x+3)\right]\times \left( \frac{1}{x+3}\right)&lt;/math&gt; (from the definition of division)
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;(x+2)\times \left[(x+3)\times \left(\frac{1}{x+3} \right) \right]&lt;/math&gt; (from the associative law of multiplication)
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;((x+2)\times (1)),\qquad x \neq -3 \,&lt;/math&gt; (from multiplicative inverse)
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;x+2, \qquad x \neq -3.&lt;/math&gt; (from multiplicative identity)
|-
|}

Of course, the above is much longer than simply cancelling &lt;math&gt;x+3&lt;/math&gt; out in both the numerator and denominator. But, when you are cancelling, you are really just doing the above steps, so it is important to know what the rules are so as to                           know when you are allowed to cancel.  Occasionally people do the following, for instance, which is incorrect:


:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2\times (x + 2)}{2}= \frac{2}{2} \times \frac{x+2}{2}=1 \times \frac{x+2}{2}= \frac{x+2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.


The correct simplification is


:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2\times (x + 2)}{2}= \left( 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \right) \times (x+2)=1 \times (x+2)=x+2&lt;/math&gt;,


where the number &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; cancels out in both the numerator and the denominator.

==Interval notation==
There are a few different ways that one can express with symbols a specific interval (all the numbers between two numbers).  One way is with inequalities.  If we wanted to denote the set of all numbers between, say, 2 and 4, we could write &quot;all ''x'' satisfying 2&lt;x&lt;4.&quot;  This excludes the endpoints 2 and 4 because we use &lt; instead of &lt;math&gt; \leq &lt;/math&gt;.  If we wanted to include the endpoints, we would write &quot;all ''x'' satisfying &lt;math&gt;2 \leq x \leq 4 &lt;/math&gt;.&quot;  This includes the endpoints.  

Another way to write these intervals would be with interval notation.  If we wished to convey &quot;all ''x'' satisfying 2&lt;''x''&lt;4&quot; we would write (2,4).  This does ''not'' include the endpoints 2 and 4.  If we wanted to include the endpoints we would write [2,4].  If we wanted to include 2 and not 4 we would write [2,4); if we wanted to exclude 2 and include 4, we would write (2,4].

Thus, we have the following table:
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Endpoint conditions
! Inequality notation
! Interval notation
|-
| Including both 2 and 4
| all ''x'' satisfying &lt;math&gt; 2 \leq x \leq 4 &lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt; [2,4] \,\! &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
|-
| Not including 2 nor 4
| all ''x'' satisfying &lt;math&gt; 2&lt;x&lt;4 \, &lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt; (2,4) \,\! &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
|-
| Including 2 not 4
| all ''x'' satisfying &lt;math&gt; 2 \leq x &lt; 4 &lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt; [2,4) \,\! &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
|-
| Including 4 not 2
| all ''x'' satisfying &lt;math&gt; 2 &lt; x \leq 4 &lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt; (2,4] \,\! &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

In general, we have the following table:
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Meaning
!Interval Notation
!Set Notation
|-
|All values greater than or equal to &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and less than or equal to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\left[a,b\right]&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\left\{x:a\le x\le b\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|All values greater than &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and less than &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\left(a,b\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\left\{x:a &lt; x &lt; b\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|All values greater than or equal to &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and less than &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\left[a,b\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\left\{x:a\le x &lt; b\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|All values greater than &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and less than or equal to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\left(a,b\right]&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\left\{x:a &lt; x\le b\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|All values greater than or equal to &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.
|&lt;math&gt;\left[a,\infty\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\left\{x:x\ge a\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|All values greater than &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.
|&lt;math&gt;\left(a,\infty\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\left\{x:x &gt; a\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|All values less than or equal to &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.
|&lt;math&gt;\left(-\infty,a\right]&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\left\{x:x\le a\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|All values less than &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.
|&lt;math&gt;\left(-\infty,a\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\left\{x:x &lt; a\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|All values.
|&lt;math&gt;\left(-\infty,\infty\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\left\{x: x\in\mathbb{R}\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; must always have an exclusive parenthesis rather than an inclusive bracket.  This is because &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; is not a number, and therefore cannot be in our set.  &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; is really just a symbol that makes things easier to write, like the intervals above.

The interval (a,b) is called an '''open interval''', and the interval [a,b] is called a '''closed interval'''.

Intervals are sets and we can use set notation to show relations between values and intervals.  If we want to say that a certain value is contained in an interval, we can use the symbol &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; to denote this.  For example, &lt;math&gt;2\in[1,3]&lt;/math&gt;.  Likewise, the symbol &lt;math&gt;\notin&lt;/math&gt; denotes that a certain element is not in an interval.  For example &lt;math&gt;0\notin(0,1)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Exponents and radicals==
There are a few rules and properties involving exponents and radicals that you'd do well to remember.  As a definition we have that if ''n'' is a positive integer then &lt;math&gt; a^n &lt;/math&gt; denotes ''n'' factors of ''a''.  That is,
&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt; a^n = a\cdot a \cdot a \cdots a \qquad (n~ \mbox{times}). &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

If &lt;math&gt; a \not= 0&lt;/math&gt; then we say that &lt;math&gt;a^0 =1 \, &lt;/math&gt;.  

If ''n'' is a negative integer then we say that &lt;math&gt; a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n} .&lt;/math&gt;  

If we have an exponent that is a fraction then we say that &lt;math&gt; a^{m/n} = \sqrt[n]{a^m} = (\sqrt[n]{a})^m .&lt;/math&gt;

In addition to the previous definitions, the following rules apply:
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Rule
! Example
|-
| &lt;math&gt; a^n \cdot a^m = a^{n+m} &lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt; 3^6 \cdot 3^9 = 3^{15} &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt; \frac{a^n}{a^m} = a^{n-m} &lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt; \frac{x^3}{x^2} = x^{1} = x &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt; (a^n)^m = a^{n\cdot m} &lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt; (x^4)^5 = x^{20} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt; (ab)^n = a^n b^n \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt; (3x)^5 = 3^5 x^5 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt; \bigg(\frac{a}{b}\bigg)^n = \frac{a^n}{b^n} &lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt; \bigg(\frac{7}{3}\bigg)^3 = \frac{7^3}{3^3}. &lt;/math&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

==Factoring and roots==
Given the expression &lt;math&gt; x^2 + 3x + 2 &lt;/math&gt;, one may ask &quot;what are the values of ''x'' that make this expression 0?&quot;  If we factor we obtain
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; x^2 + 3x + 2 = (x + 2)(x + 1). \,\! &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
If ''x''=-1 or -2, then one of the factors on the right becomes zero.  Therefore, the whole must be zero.  So, by factoring we have discovered the values of ''x'' that render the expression zero.  These values are termed &quot;roots.&quot;  In general, given a quadratic polynomial &lt;math&gt; px^2 + qx + r &lt;/math&gt; that factors as
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; px^2 + qx + r = (ax + c)(bx + d) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
then we have that ''x = -c/a'' and ''x = -d/b'' are roots of the original polynomial.

A special case to be on the look out for is the difference of two squares, &lt;math&gt; a^2 - b^2&lt;/math&gt;.  In this case, we are always able to factor as
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b). \,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
For example, consider &lt;math&gt; 4x^2 - 9 &lt;/math&gt;.  On initial inspection we would see that both &lt;math&gt; 4x^2 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; 9 &lt;/math&gt; are squares (&lt;math&gt;(2x)^2 = 4x^2 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; 3^2 = 9 &lt;/math&gt;).  Applying the previous rule we have 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 4x^2 - 9 = (2x+3)(2x-3). \,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The following is a general result of great utility.
{{Calculus/Def|text='''The quadratic formula'''&lt;br/&gt;
Given any quadratic equation &lt;math&gt;ax^2+bx+c=0, a\neq0&lt;/math&gt;, all solutions of the equation are given by the quadratic formula:&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;.}}

{{ExampleRobox|title=Example:  Find all the roots of &lt;math&gt;4x^2+7x-2&lt;/math&gt;}}
Finding the roots is equivalent to solving the equation &lt;math&gt;4x^2+7x-2=0&lt;/math&gt;.  Applying the quadratic formula with &lt;math&gt;a=4, b=7, c=-2&lt;/math&gt;, we have:&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{-7\pm\sqrt{7^2-4(4)(-2)}}{2(4)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{-7\pm\sqrt{49+32}}{8}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{-7\pm\sqrt{81}}{8}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{-7\pm9}{8}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{2}{8}, x=\frac{-16}{8}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{1}{4}, x=-2&lt;/math&gt;

{{Robox/Close}}

The quadratic formula can also help with factoring, as the next example demonstrates.

{{ExampleRobox|title=Example:  Factor the polynomial &lt;math&gt;4x^2+7x-2&lt;/math&gt;}}
We already know from the previous example that the polynomial has roots &lt;math&gt;x=\frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x=-2&lt;/math&gt;.  Our factorization will take the form&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt; C(x+2)(x-\frac{1}{4})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
All we have to do is set this expression equal to our polynomial and solve for the unknown constant C:&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; C(x+2)(x-\frac{1}{4})=4x^2+7x-2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt; C(x^2+(-\frac{1}{4}+2)x-\frac{2}{4})=4x^2+7x-2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt; C(x^2+\frac{7}{4}x-\frac{1}{2})=4x^2+7x-2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
You can see that &lt;math&gt;C=4&lt;/math&gt; solves the equation.  So the factorization is&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;4x^2+7x-2=4(x+2)(x-\frac{1}{4})=(x+2)(4x-1)&lt;/math&gt;
{{Robox/Close}}

Note that if &lt;math&gt;4ac&gt;b^2&lt;/math&gt; then the roots will not be real numbers.

==Simplifying rational expressions==
Consider the two polynomials 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; and 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; q(x) = b_m x^m + b_{m-1}x^{m-1} + \cdots + b_1x + b_0. &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
When we take the quotient of the two we obtain
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{p(x)}{q(x)} = \frac{a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0}{b_m x^m + b_{m-1}x^{m-1} + \cdots + b_1x + b_0}. &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The ratio of two polynomials is called a '''rational expression'''.  Many times we would like to simplify such a beast.  For example, say we are given &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2-1}{x+1}. &lt;/math&gt;  We may simplify this in the following way:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2-1}{x+1} = \frac{(x+1)(x-1)}{x+1} = x-1, \qquad x \neq -1 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This is nice because we have obtained something we understand quite well, &lt;math&gt;x-1 &lt;/math&gt;, from something we didn't.

==Formulas of multiplication of polynomials==
Here are some formulas that can be quite useful for solving polynomial problems:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;(a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;(a-b)^2=a^2-2ab+b^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;(a-b)(a+b)=a^2-b^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;(a\pm b)^3=a^3\pm 3a^2b+3ab^2\pm b^3&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;a^3\pm b^3=(a\pm b)(a^2\mp ab+b^2)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Polynomial Long Division==
Suppose we would like to divide one polynomial by another.  The procedure is similar to long division of numbers and is illustrated in the following example:

===Example===
{{ExampleRobox|title=Divide &lt;math&gt;x^2-2x-15&lt;/math&gt; (the dividend or numerator) by &lt;math&gt;x+3&lt;/math&gt; (the divisor or denominator)}}
Similar to long division of numbers, we set up our problem as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rl}\\
x+3\!\!\!\!&amp;\big)\!\!\!\begin{array}{lll}
\hline
\,x^2-2x-15
\end{array}\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

First we have to answer the question, how many times does &lt;math&gt;x+3&lt;/math&gt; go into &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt;?  To find out, divide the leading term of the dividend by leading term of the divisor.  So it goes in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; times.  We record this above the leading term of the dividend:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rl}&amp;~~\,x\\
x+3\!\!\!\!&amp;\big)\!\!\!\begin{array}{lll}
\hline
\,x^2-2x-15
\end{array}\\
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

, and we multiply &lt;math&gt;x+3&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and write this below the dividend as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rl}&amp;~~\,x\\
x+3\!\!\!\!&amp;\big)\!\!\!\begin{array}{lll}
\hline
\,x^2-2x-15
\end{array}\\
&amp;\!\!\!\!-\underline{(x^2+3x)~~~}\\
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Now we perform the subtraction, bringing down any terms in the dividend that aren't matched in our subtrahend: 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rl}&amp;~~\,x\\
x+3\!\!\!\!&amp;\big)\!\!\!\begin{array}{lll}
\hline
\,x^2-2x-15
\end{array}\\
&amp;\!\!\!\!-\underline{(x^2+3x)~~~}\\
&amp;\!\!\!\!~~~~~~-5x-15~~~\\
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Now we repeat, treating the bottom line as our new dividend:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rl}&amp;~~\,x-5\\
x+3\!\!\!\!&amp;\big)\!\!\!\begin{array}{lll}
\hline
\,x^2-2x-15
\end{array}\\
&amp;\!\!\!\!-\underline{(x^2+3x)~~~}\\
&amp;\!\!\!\!~~~~~~-5x-15~~~\\
&amp;\!\!\!\!~~~-\underline{(-5x-15)~~~}\\
&amp;\!\!\!\!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~0~~~\\
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

In this case we have no remainder.

===Application:  Factoring Polynomials===
We can use polynomial long division to factor a polynomial if we know one of the factors in advance.  For example, suppose we have a polynomial &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; and we know that &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is a root of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.  If we perform polynomial long division using P(x) as the dividend and &lt;math&gt;(x-r)&lt;/math&gt; as the divisor, we will obtain a polynomial &lt;math&gt;Q(x)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;P(x)=(x-r)Q(x)&lt;/math&gt;, where the degree of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is one less than the degree of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

===Exercise===
{{question-answer|question=1.  Factor &lt;math&gt;x-1&lt;/math&gt; out of &lt;math&gt;6x^3-4x^2+3x-5&lt;/math&gt;.|answer={{noprint|&lt;math&gt;(x-1)(6x^2+2x+5)&lt;/math&gt;}}}}

===Application:  Breaking up a rational function===
Similar to the way one can convert an improper fraction into an integer plus a proper fraction, one can convert a rational function &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; whose numerator &lt;math&gt;N(x)&lt;/math&gt; has degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and whose denominator &lt;math&gt;D(x)&lt;/math&gt; has degree &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n\geq d&lt;/math&gt; into a polynomial plus a rational function whose numerator has degree &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; and denominator has degree &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;N(x)&lt;/math&gt; divided by &lt;math&gt;D(x)&lt;/math&gt; has quotient &lt;math&gt;Q(x)&lt;/math&gt; and remainder &lt;math&gt;R(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  That is
:&lt;math&gt;N(x)=D(x)Q(x)+R(x)&lt;/math&gt;
Dividing both sides by &lt;math&gt;D(x)&lt;/math&gt; gives
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{N(x)}{D(x)}=Q(x)+\frac{R(x)}{D(x)}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;R(x)&lt;/math&gt; will have degree less than &lt;math&gt;D(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

====Example====
{{ExampleRobox|title=Write &lt;math&gt;\frac{x-1}{x-3}&lt;/math&gt; as a polynomial plus a rational function with numerator having degree less than the denominator.}}
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rl}&amp;~~\,1\\
x-3\!\!\!\!&amp;\big)\!\!\!\begin{array}{lll}
\hline
\,x-1
\end{array}\\
&amp;\!\!\!\!-\underline{(x-3)~~~}\\
&amp;\!\!\!\!~~~~~~~~~2~~~\\
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
so
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x-1}{x-3}=1+\frac{2}{x-3}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Pottery Making by the Luisenos Indians ==

The only tools used in pottery making are a flat piece of wood and a smooth pebble of suitable size. Pottery is baked by merely digging a pit and filling it with dry cow-dung, among which the vessels are placed. The dry bark of trees was formerly used, wood not making a sufficiently hot fire. The clay used is thoroughly kneaded and tempered, and strips or coils of it are gradually added to the edge of the growing vessel.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Stone Tools and Implements used by the Luisenos Indians ==

The ordinary pestle is merely a conveniently shaped stone, and the ordinary mortar a hole in a large flat granite rock near the dwelling. But many mortars are made of roundish boulders, mostly granite, though some are of tufa rock from a locality near the coast. So there are two kinds of mortars, the permanent ones of the large rocks, and others made from loose boulders, which, being portable, may be used where there are no large rocks near, or when, on account of bad weather, it is necessary to do the grinding under shelter.

In beginning to make a new mortar, arusut, the hole was not hollowed out at once to the required depth. A slight cavity was chipped in the rock, and a basin-shaped basket placed over it and glued in place with asphaltum or pitch, the sides of the basket keeping the acorns or other seeds from flying out when struck with the pestle. But with constant use the slight cavity made in the rock becomes deeper and deeper until the basket is no longer necessary, when it is removed. Many discarded mortars are found that have been worn clear through by continual pounding. Often on a large flat rock a number of mortar holes will be found, some of them of the usual depth, others only an inch or two deep, evidently just begun, while others may be a foot or more in depth, which having by continued use become too deep, have been abandoned and the new holes commenced.

One kind of mortar, tamyush, was used exclusively by the medicine men for pounding up the roots of jimson weed, Datura meteloides, for use at the boys' puberty ceremony. Some of these are quite symmetrical, being polished with considerable care, and some have even an attempt at ornamentation in the shape of grooves cut on the outside. The pestle of these mortars is also neatly shaped and polished. Another and very small mortar, tamya-mal, is said to have been used for mixing paint. This is also polished, and is almost exactly round.

It is a question whether the metates or grinding stones, ngohilish, now in use were employed prior to the arrival of the Mexicans. Some of the Luisenos think they were, while others say they were not, that their ancestors used only mortars. The rub-stone of the metate is called ngohilish po-ma, metate its-hand.

Flat perforated stones have been found. It is thought these were formerly used for cooking, the hole enabling them to be easily handled, when hot, by a stick thrust through them. They were probably also used for heating water.

A large stone tool has been found which may perhaps be called a stone adze. It weighs nearly eleven pounds, and was evidently intended to be used by being grasped with both hands.

Small sharp-edged flakes of a hard black stone were used as knives. Larger stones with a cutting edge were probably used for skinning or fleshing hides, but some are heavier than would be required for these purposes.

Certainly, prediction of the future is not easy but I want to have venture and tell future years will be very hard for whole of the people in all over the world. it is not important where you live or what you do this is not  considerable you are rich or poor because when something happens it happen s and no one cannot prevent it .many years ago when karl Marks for the first time expressed his ideas about communism no one did not think one day his views create such a tremendous  system in the soviet union ,and the other parts of the world .he explained his theories simply and suddenly the great revolution happened and changed many things  so  I think this is the time for considering more serious  about the events  around us because may be tomorrow  is very late.

Today everyone knows the condition of life is more harder than the past .T he good old days have been passed and they don’t comeback. The days that you could think only about yourself you’re family and your problems. The days that you didn’t worried about the future of your children or your retirement but why? The answer is simple because   the humans are sacrifices of their acts in the past. It is a bit hard interpret when the first mistake happened and who was committed it but one thing is clear it was a great mistake and it had a heavy price. Many people believe 11of September of 2003 was the dark beginning for whole of these events. The time of ruining the calm and peace in whole of the places and countries .the others tell starting the economic stagnation ignited the sparkle, but I believe whole of the matters are more complicated than these and I want explain my hypothesis with an easy example. Based on rules of Newton the quantity of the action power is equal with the reaction power and this helps everything remains neutral. by the other hand we can tell in our universe the number of positive charges are equal with negative charges and this preserve the balance of the life. Now if one factor disarrange the equivalence there are deterrent elements in the nature that can compensate the problem and reserve the normal situation, and Just think during these years how much time the human have been break  this simple rule. They use the bombs for killing the people which don’t have the same idea with them, they fight with each other because of oil, gas and nuclear power. They victimize the innocents for reaching faster to their desires, simply they change the equivalence of the charges and so they should pay the price.
We have the future, something ambiguous, vague and unknown. This future will be our retribution, undoubtedly in this future we will have more conflict, more discrimination and more wars. Selfishness will not allow the people tolerate each other and because of this reason many of the countries will be dissociate, by the other hand in the near future we will have more countries and more polarization, and this will be the time of banality.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA XNA], the Microsoft developed programming tools acting as a wrapper for the industry standard Direct X, have been increasing in popularity thanks to its goal of streamlining the 3D programming process and its innate ability to cross-develop for the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360 Xbox 360]. Along with this [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software) Blender], developed by 'The Blender Foundation' is a 3D development tool publicly and freely available, having a breadth of features comparable to commercial 3D applications.

This tutorial is designed to provide a guide to combining these two easily available tools to help create games in as simple and a visual way as possible, for the purposes of;
* amateur developers looking for an introduction to these features,
* hobby coders, to provide a framework for future, more advanced projects,
* programmers with some experience in the popular 2D aspects of XNA, looking to broaden their knowledge.

This tutorial revolves around a simple game revolving around the user playing a fish chasing other fishes swimming in the opposite direction. Examples of all of the basic elements to get started on a simple game are included, including controls, sound, and gameplay.

If you are a programmer or 3D modeler, feel free to contribute! Any extra content is appreciated!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Why is oil important?==
Because our modern economy is lubricated by oil - and not just literally! In fact the world around us would be unimaginably different if it wasn’t for oil.

The most obvious use of oil is transportation: 95% of all transport is powered by oil - virtually every car, lorry, ship and aircraft in the world runs on it.  But did you also know that oil is vital for making plastics?  Look around, and try to imagine a world without plastic.  
It is used in pretty much every industrial process you can imagine, including modern methods of food production.  We use it for heating, and electricity generation. Oil is the most versatile and, very importantly, the cheapest form of energy known to man. We are so dependent on oil that to truly understand how anything works in our current society we need to grasp the vital role played by oil in our technologies.  Reduce or take away oil from a modern society, and it will very quickly grind to a halt.  [Pie chart of oil useage?]

==Are we about to run out of oil?==
No, we are not about to run out of oil! We are roughly half way through all the conventional oil we know to exist in the world. Oil production will carry on for many more years.  The key issue today is not running out of oil, but whether we can produce it quickly enough to satisfy our economy's demand.  And that is where peak oil comes in.

==What is peak oil?==
This is the phrase that has been adopted to refer to the point in time when worldwide oil production reaches a peak.  After the peak, the amount of oil produced year on year will decline.

If you look at the pattern of oil production for a single oil field you find that, in general, production from that field increases in the early years and reaches a peak when roughly half of the recoverable oil has been extracted. There after little can be done to stop production rates falling. For an individual oil field the actual pattern can be jagged.  When you combine the data for many fields, a smoother pattern emerges.  [Graphs to show individual field and averaged pattern]

The same principle applies to a basin, a country and the world. When we have used half the world's recoverable oil then production will start to decline. That point is call 'peak oil'. Many predictions have been made as to when this will occur however dates are increasingly converging on the period 2005 to 2015.  Unfortunately the data for any given year takes time to come out, so it will be at least 1-2 years after peak oil has happened before we can be sure we are on the downward trend.

==Who came up with this idea of peak oil?  Is it really credible?==
The theory was developed by M King Hubbert in the 1950s.  In 1956 he predicted that US oil production would peak in the late 60s or early 70s.  At the time he was derided, but in 1970 US oil production did indeed peak, and has declined ever since.  Oil production in many countries around the world [list and dates] has peaked, in line with Hubbert's theory.

Hubbert was an American geophysicist, who for much of his career worked for the Shell Oil Company.  When he left Shell in 1964 he became the senior research geophysicist for the United States Geological Survey, and held professorships at both Stanford and Berkeley.  We find his experience and theory credible - but then if we didn't we wouldn't have written this! 

Fortunately, we're not the only ones who are taking notice of peak oil.  Over the last year some journalists in the mainstream media organisations have woken up to the issue, and have written articles or presented programmes warning of the danger.  For example [list 4 or 5 best examples, preferably with hyperlinks].

Ultimately, though, whether you think peak oil is credible is up to you.  At the very least, we hope this book will encourage everyone who reads it to think seriously about the issue.
oil started to be found in 1907.

==Is peak oil the end of the world as we know it?==
The end of the world?  That's a bit apocalyptic! But that said, it's important not to underestimate the effects of peak oil.  Once oil production is over the peak and in decline it will become increasingly difficult to continue with our current lifestyles, and change will be forced upon us. As will be addressed in more detail later in this book the world economy is based on economic and financial systems that are reliant on overall growth - which in itself relies on increasing use of resources. Energy is, arguably, the primary resource. With enough energy virtually any other objective can be achieved.

Oil counts for about 40% of total energy use in a Western economy and over 90% [Why not 95%? - see paragraph 2 of  &quot;Why is oil important?&quot; above] of transportation. The critical need is (ultimately) to produce enough alternative primary energy. Whilst there are potential alternatives, for the reasons set out below these are not likely to fill the gap left by declining oil supplies. A totally novel energy source may be developed (and there are candidates), however these are unproven and will require many years to bring from laboratory and to turn into viable energy sources. We are thus facing, at best, chronic economic recession lasting 10s of years. This is very likely to be accompanied by political, financial and economic turmoil, armed conflicts leading to fundamental shifts in the balance of power between nations. The Western consumerist way of life will no longer be viable. It won't be a smooth ride.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is oil’s place in the history of energy?==
Oil was not the energy source that enabled the industrial revolution to begin; water, wood, and coal powered machines were working long before the first commercial oil well was drilled in north western Pennsylvania in 1869 [1]. The next thirty years after that first drilling saw oil wells spring up all over the United States and then the rest of the world as companies such as Standard Oil, Shell and Royal Dutch battled to explore and drill.

The influx of this new form of energy acted as an accelerant to industrial growth in the latter part of the industrial revolution. Initially oil replaced whale oil used for illumination, but soon it was refined and used for lubricating faster, more efficient machinery, and by the start of the 20th century for fuel and roads. Oil as a cheap energy source created massive economic growth in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and soon became central to industrial society.

Oil crucially also enabled other forms of energy to become viable. The infrastructure supporting natural gas, nuclear and even renewable energy is dependent on oil as an energy resource. The changes oil has made to the way we live means that contemporary, modern society views cheap and plentiful energy as a natural part of human existence. Not having this energy on tap is incomprehensible to most people in the modern world, despite the fact that mankind's tenure on this planet stretches back over hundreds of thousands, if not a couple of million years. Agriculture emerged 10,000 years ago fundamentally altering the way humans lived, and the discovery of oil has arguably had an even bigger impact.

[1] James Howard Kuntsler,'The Long Emergency', Atlantic Books, 2005

==Why is oil so useful?==
'''Energy Density'''

Energy density is the measure of how much energy you get out of a given amount of a fuel. Approximate energy densities of combustible fuels include coal at 17-30 MJ/kg, and wood at 10-20 MJ/kg.  The energy density for petroleum products is 30-460% greater, at typically 40-46 MJ/Kg. [Source?]

In terms of energy density only uranium, when it is used for fission [find figure MJ/Kg] does better than oil.

'''Transportability'''

Because it is a relatively stable liquid at normal temperatures, oil is easy to transport. It used to be poured into barrels and transported around on trains. Nowadays it is more common for it to be transported through pipelines, seaborne tankers or, once refined, by road tanker.  This also means it is easy to use - imagine the days of steam ships, and having first to load thousands of tons of coal, and then shovel it into the furnaces.  Now compare that with how easy it is to power an engine with oil - think of filling a car with petrol and driving away!

'''Storage and stability'''

At normal temperatures oil is relatively stable and does not degrade quickly. This means that oil is relatively easy to store, especially in its crude (unrefined) form. Most countries hold large strategic reserves in case of supply disruption - the US holds these in vast underground caverns [capacity?].

'''Price of extraction and processing'''

For many oil reserves, once the well has been drilled, the oil flows out freely due to the natural high pressures. As this pressure starts to decrease, secondary recovery techniques are often used. For both primary and secondary recovery the energy inputs required to get the oil out of the ground are far less than for other fuels (natural gas excluded). As the easy to extract oil is used up then these figures will increase, for example deep sea oil takes much more energy to get to a refinery than does some of the onshore reserves in Saudi Arabia.

'''Abundance'''

Crude oil and natural gas have been relatively abundant over the last fifty years. Indeed at some periods so much has been extracted from the earth that the price has dropped so low as to seriously effect the income of some oil producing nations. This in essence led to the formation of the OPEC countries and their self imposition of production quotas. Its ready availability and cheap price has helped increase our dependency.

'''Versatility'''

The vast number of uses of oil, both in energy, heating, transport and products mean that today's society is highly dependent on its availability. More details on its uses are outlined in the next section.

==What do we use it for?==
'''Plastics'''

Look around you. There is a phenomenal amount of plastic all about us in the modern world.  Think about your computer - the tower, monitor, keyboard, mouse, webcam, speakers, printer, scanner; all substantially plastic.
 
What about the chair you are sitting on?  The pens around your desk? Your CD and DVD or video collections, encased in or made from plastic.  From disposable cups to car dashboards to PVC window frames to radios and televisions, not to mention your mobile phone, every electrical cable or plug, and the shrink-wrap on almost everything you buy.  Creating plastics from oil has transformed our world.

'''Heating'''

In the UK most of our space heating comes from natural gas. In more rural areas, and other countries, heating oil plays a greater role.

'''Petrol and diesel'''

Over 500,000,000 vehicles [source?] around the world aren't much use with empty tanks.  And how would your lifestyle change if those vehicles were to be out of action?

'''Aviation fuel - both for light aircraft and jets
'''
There are roughly 20,000 commercial aircraft [source?] carrying people and goods around the world at the moment.

'''Electricity'''

Whilst natural gas, coal and nuclear make up the bulk of our electricity generation in the UK, oil fired power plants still play an important role in electricity generation around the world.

'''Lubrication'''

Without lubrication much of our society would literally grind to a halt.

'''Man-made fibres'''

Many man made fibres [examples?] used in carpets, curtains, clothes and other materials are made from petroleum products.

'''Fertilizers and Pesticides'''

Current intensive farming techniques rely on huge quantities of oil and natural gas derived fertilizers and pesticides. [Source and number for quantities?]

'''Pharmaceuticals'''

Many of our manufactured drugs are petroleum derived. [Examples and source?]

'''Hydrogen'''

Another important petroleum derived product is hydrogen from natural gas. Elemental hydrogen does not naturally exist in large quantities and must be generated using either electrolysis or from natural gas, with natural gas being the major source at present.

Examples of other petroleum derived products include food additives, non-soap detergents, ink dyes, photographic film, wax, rubber, backup generators, insulation, packaging, paint and the list goes on and on.

It is also important to realise that our society relies on oil and its products to an even greater secondary degree. For example, although our vegetables aren't made out of oil, it is used in fertilizers, pesticides, powering farm vehicles, preserving, packaging, transporting. Another example is the manufacture and transportation of goods to market, from plasma screens to ping pong balls.

In essence, oil underpins most facets of our lives, in terms of keeping people employed, keeping things going and keeping things alive.

==What doesn’t depend on oil?==
Look around you and identify anything that is not made from oil. If it isn’t made from oil did it get where it is due to oil-based transportation? Was oil used in its production or manufacturing process? Did the people who were involved in that process use oil to get to work? When you look at it this way you see just how dependent on oil we are.

==How much of our energy mix is oil?==
Electricity (2004)  [Are more recent figures now available?] Gas 40%, nuclear 19%, Coal 33%, Hydro 1% Imports 2%, Other Fuels 4%, Oil 1%

Inland Energy Consumption: Gas 41%, Oil 24% and Coal 17% out of a total of 234.9 million barrels of oil equivalent.

Oil and Gas have the following percentage inputs to each of these parts of society:

Industry Domestic Transport Services

Oil 24% 6% 99% 46%

Gas 37% 70% 0% 8%

Combines 61% 76% 99% 53%

[Speak to Paul Mobbs and get Fig 11. A Flow Diagram of Energy Use in the UK 2003 from page 29 of Energy Beyond Oil]

==How does oil compare with other sources of energy?==
Oil presents many advantages when compared to other sources of energy such as coal, nuclear power, hydroelectric generation or other renewables. These advantages fall into the six catagories mentioned above: energy density, transportability, storage and stability, price of extraction, abundance, and versatility.

Coal, for example, fails to surpass oil in nearly all of the catagories: First, it has a about half the energy density of oil, (17-30 MJ/kg compared with the 40-46 MJ/Kg of oil). As coal is a solid, it is much more difficult to transport—simply compare the effort it takes to fill-up at the petrol station with images of men stoking the coal furnace on old steam trains! This solid state means it's also more difficult to extract, as it must be mined from seams in the earth rather than pumped out of underground reservoirs. The main advantages of coal are that it's much more abundant than oil, with significant quantities being found in most countries.

The nuclear energy generated from uranium ore compares nearly as poorly. The uranium must not only be mined like coal, but also separated from the surrounding ore and &quot;enriched&quot; by isolating the correct type of uranium. Even this enriched uranium cannot be used directly, but must be safely transported to the nuclear reactor before any of its energy can be obtained. This all means that the high energy density of the uranium itself is less important, as so much energy is required before that energy is available. The energy is finally produced as electricity, which although convenient for transport along power lines and usable in any household applicance, is unsuitable as a portable fuel in cars and planes, and cannot be used to make plastics or other chemicals.

Energy from renewable sources suffers mainly from the last point as well. Wind, solar, and all forms of hydroelectric generation produce only electricity. While electric cars are in use today, their electric batteries have a much lower energy density than oil: they either force the car to travel shorter distances before recharging, or take up far more space than a conventional fuel-tank. The abundance of renewable sources, however, is a promising advantage: whether it's strong sunlight, large rivers or frequent winds, nearly every region on Earth has access to local renewable energy.
 
Historically, oil has also been the cheapest form of energy, and readily available.  Both the cost and availablity of energy are crucial to our modern society, as economic growth is predicated by energy growth.

==What do you mean that economic growth is predicated by energy growth?==
If there was not cheap, plentiful energy, and more of it every year, the world’s economy would not grow. Because oil has all the advantages and uses outlined above, the oil price is extremely influential on the rate of world economic growth.  If there is not more oil every year the laws of supply and demand push the price up until the economy will not bear the price rise and we experience economic depression. 

The economy is a system like any other, it needs inputs to create outputs, you put energy in and you get all the products and services our modern society uses out. Of course this seems obvious, to grow something you need more of what makes it grow: more fertilizer, more plant. Modern economics requires constant growth, its logic assumes that there is no limit to energy consumption, forgetting that constant growth will eventually use up all resources in a finite environment.

To understand economic growth and energy you must understand how money is created, and how money and the banking system work together. This is covered in Section Five - Oil &amp; The Economy.

==How was oil created?==
Around 360 to 286 million years ago, climatic conditions on Earth favoured a huge proliferation in plants such as trees and ferns. Over millions of years, the remains of plants and animals were washed into the world's oceans, along with large quantities of sediment carried by rivers. The organic matter sank to the bottom of the oceans and was buried under layers of sediment, where it decayed. As more and more layers of sediment buried the organic matter, the pressure and temperature increased. Certain bacteria that thrive in anaerobic (oxygen starved) conditions began the process of transforming the rotting matter into crude oil, gas and coal.

The high pressures compacted the sediments into rocks (sandstones and limestones). The oil and gas slowly migrated into the pores of these rocks, which are referred to as &quot;source rocks&quot; by petroleum geologists. In many cases, the oil and gas seeped through cracks in the overlying rock strata and leaked away to the surface. However, in some cases the oil and gas deposits were prevented from reaching the surface by an impermeable rock layer (often a thick layer of salt). This caused a build-up of pressure behind the impermeable layer, pushing the overlying strata upwards. The distinctive salt &quot;dome&quot; is regarded as being indicative of potential oil and gas deposits.

==Where is the remaining oil?==
http://www.hubbertpeak.com/campbell/images/com17.gif

This graph demonstrates where [declared?] oil reserves are located. You can see by a long way, it is concentrated in the Middle East. Western Europe has a small endowment, rapidly declining.

==Who uses all that oil?==
http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2174rank.html

The USA is by far the largest consumer, followed by the European Union, China and Japan. It is largely the countries with decreasing native supplies that are using more and more. As countries such as China, India and Japan increase their economy and living standards increase, their demand for oil will continue to grow at a fast rate. [Graph to show rate of increase of consumption?]

==How much do we use a day?==
The Chevron website (http://www.willyoujoinus.com/) has an automated ticker that shows how many barrels of oil the world uses as time progresses. At present this is roughly 85 [update] million barrels a day. In 1986 that figure was 60 million barrels a day. In 1966 it was 33 million barrels a day.

85 million barrels is:

3,570,000,000 US gallons

or 2,972,450,000 imperial gallons

or 13,515,000,000 litres

or 637,500,000 tonnes

or 485,350,000 giga joules

or 5406 Olympic size swimming pools - (1,973,190 swimming pools a year)

Its always difficult to work out the average oil use per country due to the different energy mixes, the different uses of oil and problems such as production in one country and consumption in another. However as a rough comparision the world average per capita consumption (excluding UK and US) is 1.6 litres a day, the UK average is 4.9 litres a day and the US average is 11 litres a day.

==How much oil is left?==
This is quite a controversial subject. For example, do we include unconventional oil? Can we know the ultimate recoverable reserves figure? If we include unconventional oil we can reach figures of 3 trillion barrels, but if we stick to conventional oil, it is about 1 trillion.

==So how long will it take us to use that much oil?==
If we go with the assumption touted by many that we have 1 trillion barrels of oil left (CIA, Chevron etc), that would give us about 35 years of usage at current rates of consumption before we ran out. But this also assumes oil production can be kept at a steady pace for 30 years. However, due to the nature of oil production, the 'Hubbert Curve', geological factors mean we will be forced to use less, earlier, meaning we will have oil for longer, but at an increasingly lower level.

==Isn’t it true that oil reserves have just been growing and growing?==
http://www.geologie.tu-clausthal.de/Campbell/img/20.gif

If you look at this first graph, of oil discoveries as reported, you would think that is true.

==So aren’t we discovering more?==
http://wolf.readinglitho.co.uk/chartpages/d/d1oildiscavproj.html

This second graph shows all you need to know. Colin Campbell of ASPO went back and charted all the real discovery data, not the reported discovery data. What this shows is that oil discovery peaked in the mid 1960s, and from around 1980 we started consuming more than we discovered. The reason why oil discovery has peaked is that oil companies know where oil will be, so it is easy to find the largest reserves first. Despite increased investment in finding new oil fields, there really is little of any significance being found.

==Why aren’t reserves the important thing?==
Quite simply, it is the supply rates that are the most important thing. If you've got a house on fire by a lake but can only use one bucket of water at a time to put the fire out, it is clear to see that it is flow rates that is the important thing.

==Didn't I read that oil is renewable?==
You might have done, but it's not a generally accepted view.

The conventional scientific explanation for the origin of oil is that organic matter, buried under sediments millions of years ago, gradually became &quot;pressure cooked&quot; into crude oil by high temperatures and pressures (see &quot;How was oil created?&quot; above). This is why oil is referred to as as &quot;fossil fuel&quot;. This theory is backed by the collected evidence from a century of oil drilling and scientific analysis, and is the basis for all modern oil prospecting methods.

An alternative theory, originally proposed by Russian scientists, is that oil has a non-biological (abiotic) origin. The abiotic theory proposes that oil originates from methane and carbon dioxide deep within the Earth's mantle, which is converted to heavier hydrocarbons by high temperatures. This implies that oil reservoirs will be continuously refilled after oil extraction has taken place. However, as author Richard Heinberg notes:

&quot;If there are in fact vast untapped deep pools of hydrocarbons refilling the reservoirs that oil producers drill into, it appears to make little difference to actual production, as tens of thousands of oil and gas fields around the world are observed to deplete, and refilling (which is indeed very rarely observed) is not occurring at a commercially significant scale or rate except in one minor and controversial instance[...]&quot; [1]

The abiotic theory of petroleum origin is not taken seriously by the majority of scientists in the field. Even if it were found to be true, we are consuming oil at a far higher rate than could be sustained (as is shown by the graph of the US peak - after all, if it was being replenished at a sustainable rate, there would be no decline!), and there will still be a peak and decline in global oil production.

[1] http://www.museletter.com/archive/150b.html

==Can’t we just spend more money on discovering it?==
The major oil companies such as ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, BP etc have been doing just that. However, they are increasingly finding that the record amounts of money they've been spending on exploration are not being covered by the value of new oil discoveries. [1]

[1] http://www.energybulletin.net/2470.html

==Can’t we use technology to improve extraction?==
We have been. From water injection to superstraw drilling, technology has been implemented to improve the extraction rates from oil fields. That is why newer oil provinces tend to peak earlier after discovery than older fields There hasn’t really been any improvement in technology in recent years though that will not make much of a difference. If you look at Prudhoe Bay in America, where they have the access to the technology, you can see it has made little difference.

“Of course it is possible to go back to an old field developed long ago with poor technology and extract a little more oil from it by a range of well known methods, such as steam injection. But this is a phenomenon of the dying days of old onshore fields of the United States, Soviet Union and Venezuela. Most modern fields are developed efficiently from the beginning. In any event the addition contributes little in global terms and has no impact on peak. Technology serves mainly to hold production rate as high as possible for as long as possible. That obviously makes the most profit. But it adds little to the reserves themselves and clearly accelerates the rate of depletion. The high depletion rate of Norway shows how efficient they have been at extending plateau production. The decline slope now becomes a cliff.”

http://www.hubbertpeak.com/campbell/images/com15.gif

http://www.hubbertpeak.com/campbell/commons.htm

Another problem is that technology may actually be counter-productive. For example, Matt Simmons talks of the Saudi oil fields being damaged by inappropriate water injection.

“Pumping large amounts of oil at the maximum rate can damage the geological structure of the field, usually referred to as &quot;rate sensitivity&quot;. Basically the hole falls in on itself, making large amounts of oil within it un-extractable.”

==What is the official view on when we will peak?==
[We need to build in the July 2007 IEA Medium Term Report]

According to the UK Government's Energy white paper 2003, &quot;Our Energy Future - Creating a Low Carbon Economy&quot; [1] &quot;Globally conventional oil reserves are sufficient to meet projected demand for around 30 years, although new discoveries will be needed to renew reserves. Together with non-conventional reserves such as oil shales and improvements in technology, there is potential for oil reserves to last twice as long&quot;.

This is consistent with the assessment made in the International Energy Agency's 2004 World Energy Outlook, which concludes that &quot;...global production of conventional oil will not peak before 2030 if the necessary investments are made&quot;. However, this assessment rests on the assumption that oil discoveries have been declining purely as a result of reduced explortion activity, and that greater investment in exploration will yield massive new reserves.

[1] http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/whitepaper/index.shtml

This date is premised on the USGS Mean estimate of 2626 Gb (billion barrels) for remaining conventional oil. It goes on to state that if this estimate should prove too high, the peak of production would come by 2015 or before. This means that the IEA accepts the notion of peak oil, that the date ranges from 2015 to 2033, but even sooner if all assumptions are not fulfilled. “ It follows that Governments are now on notice that they must make energy plans for the future that accept peak oil as a reality.” Kjell Aleklett

http://www.peakoil.net/uhdsg/weo2004/TheUppsalaCode.html

==When do others think we will peak?==
There are a range of predictions being advanced by independent experts, starting as early as 2005 to around 2020. Here is a summary taken from the Hirsch Report [1]:

2007-2009 Simmons, M.R. Investment banker


After 2007 Skrebowski, C. Petroleum journal Editor


Before 2009 Deffeyes, K.S. Oil company geologist (ret.)


Before 2010 Goodstein, D. Vice Provost, Cal Tech

NB: Deffeyes has since revised his prediction and believes we passed peak oil in late 2005.


[1] http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/others/pdf/Oil_Peaking_NETL.pdf

==Why do people think we will peak now?==
There are several key indicators for this.

The main approach, using Hubbert’s model for oil production, points to a Peak in the first decade of the 21st century. This is championed by the likes of Colin Campbell at the Association for the Study of peak oil and Gas. A refined version of Hubbert’s model has been created by Prof. Kenneth Deffeyes and he believes the Peak occurred at the end of 2005. Because this model relies a lot on the ultimately recoverable reserves it can be refuted by some by pointing to things such as unconventional oils from, for example, tar sands in Canada. If unconventional oil is included reserves can be pushed up to 3 or 4 trillion.

Much more useful, now that we are near the Peak, is the work by Chris Skrebowski, editor of Petroleum Review. He conducts a yearly review of all the oil fields in the world, looking at the data for oil fields coming online over the next few years, and looking at the decline rates of current oil fields. It is the only field by field analysis conducted. This is a very useful approach as it is the flow rates that are the important thing. It presents a clear view of how future production flows are going to work. He notes that “90% of known reserves are in production,” and that “as much as 70% of the world’s producing oil fields are now in decline” with decline rates averaging between four and six percent per year. When you get to the point where you can no longer offset the decline of current oil fields with the increase in production at current oil fields or bringing on new oil fields, then you have global oil decline. That is why it is so important to understand depletion, not just increases in production – you have to take into account the full sum. Chris Skrebowski’s work strongly suggests a Peak occurring by 2011 [update?].

http://www.energybulletin.net/5395.html

http://www.energybulletin.net/5266.html

Other points to take into consideration:

Global rates of discovery have been falling since the mid 1960s as has been confirmed by ExxonMobil [source?]. This is a well established trend.

We are consuming much more than we discover – In 2005, according to IHS Energy Inc., a total of 4.5 billion barrels of oil were discovered in new fields, while 30 billion barrels of oil were extracted and used worldwide. Thus, currently only about one barrel of oil is being discovered for every six extracted.

http://www.energybulletin.net/14102.html

The 100 or so giant and super-giant fields that are collectively responsible for about half of current world production were all discovered in the 1940s, ’50s, ’60s, and ’70s and most are now going into decline. These days, exploration turns up only much smaller fields that deplete relatively quickly.

==Have people made wrong predictions about peak oil before?==
Absolutely. People have been talking about the end of oil almost as long as the oil industry has been around. People have made pessimistic predictions, but there have also been optimistic predictions made too.

“In 1968 the USGS released predictions of US oil production showing continuing production growth far into the future. This report was discredited in 1974 but not after it had done serious economic damage due to errors in economic planning. History appears to be repeating itself. Recently on Channel 4 news the retired head of exploration at the Saudi state owned oil company Aramco, Sadad Al-Husseini, had this to say about the USGS estimates. ‘They’re not only overestimating the Middle East, but they overestimate non-Opec, they overestimate Russia, they overestimate the whole global resource base. And I think this is a rather dangerous situation for the US government policy to be based on.’”

http://www.oilcrash.com/articles/oil_wrng.htm

However, there is much more knowledge about the nature of oil production now, about discovery &amp; decline trends, and what is likely to happen. This is one of the reasons why many analysts see a Peak very likely the first decade of the 21st century.

==Have we passed any peaks?==
In terms of energy, world oil production per capita [also peaked in 1979??] and his since fallen faster than world energy production per capita.

==What do the oil companies think?==

On November 19th 2007 the Wall St Journal's front page was headlined &quot;[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119543677899797558.html?mod=hpp_us_whats_news Oil Officials See Limit Looming on Production]&quot;.  The article goes on to say 'A growing number of oil-industry chieftains are endorsing an idea long deemed fringe: The world is approaching a practical limit to the number of barrels of crude oil that can be pumped every day.  Some predict that, despite the world's fast-growing thirst for oil, producers could hit that ceiling as soon as 2012. This rough limit -- which two senior industry officials recently pegged at about 100 million barrels a day -- is well short of global demand projections over the next few decades.'

Other oil industry executives have also expressed a view.

‘My view is that “easy” oil has probably passed its peak.’ [http://news.ft.com/cms/s/fb775ee8-8d0e-11da-9daf-0000779e2340.html Jeroen van der Veer, Chief Executive, Royal Dutch Shell]

[http://www.willyoujoinus.com/ Chevron] states:

&quot;Energy will be one of the defining issues of this century, and one thing is clear: the era of easy oil is over. What we all do next will determine how well we meet the energy needs of the entire world in this century and beyond.&quot;


A senior BP executive has said:

&quot;Discovered hydrocarbon volumes have been declining since the end of the ’60s. The deepwater theme of the ’90s and a renewed search for gas has helped to reverse this trend but the last few years have been poor for exploration. The number of supergiantfields and the number of giant provinces have fallen off markedly in recent decades. Field sizes are declining...&quot;

http://www.aspo-usa.com/exxonmobil.cfm


Exxon on the other hand says:

&quot;Contrary to the theory, oil shows no sign of a peak&quot;

http://www.exxonmobil.com/Corporate/Files/Corporate/OpEd_peakoil.pdf

Jeremy Gilbert is the recently retired Chief Petroleum Engineer of BP with a lifetime of experience in the oil industry. Although he does not represent the official BP position, the fact that he has now come out and [[http://www.scag.ca.gov/rcp/pdf/summit/Gilbert.pdf agreed that peak oil is soon]] is important to note.

==What happened to all the spare capacity?==
Rapid growth demand in emerging economies such as China and India, combined with increases in production failing to offset the rate of decline fast enough has meant there is now no spare capacity. Saudi Arabia used to be the swing producer, able to turn on the taps as and when needed, but now it cannot provide as much of the cheap, easy oil. The spare capacity remaining is dirty heavy oil , about 1 million barrels, with no refining capacity to deal with it.

==Wasn’t all this predicted in the 1970s? Didn’t it turn out to be wrong?==
‘The Limits to Growth’ by The Club of Rome was published in 1972. Using sophisticated computer models from MIT, it said the world would ultimately run out of many key resources. Over the following few decades it was mocked by economists as the supply of resources just kept on increasing and prices dropped. People now refer to it as having predicted that we’d have run out of oil by 2000, and then use this to discount all other warnings about oil supplies.

“Nowhere in the book was there any mention about running out of anything by 2000. Instead, the book's concern was entirely focused on what the world might look like 100 years later. There was not one sentence or even a single word written about an oil shortage, or limit to any specific resource, by the year 2000.

The members of the &quot;Club or Rome&quot; were also not a mysterious, sinister, anonymous group of doomsayers. Rather, they were a group of 30 thoughtful, public spirited-intellects from ten different countries. The group included scientists, economists, educators, and industrialists. The book then postulated that if a continuation of the exponential growth of the seventies began in the world's population, its industrial output, agricultural and natural resource consumption and the pollution produced by all of the above, would result in severe constraints on all known global resources by 2050 to 2070. The most amazing aspect of the book is how accurate many of the basic trend extrapolation worries which ultimately give raise to the limits this book expresses still are, some 30 years later. In fact, for a work that has been derisively attacked by so many energy economists, a group whose own forecasting record has not stood the test of time very well, there was nothing that I could find in the book which has so far been even vaguely invalidated. To the contrary, the chilling warnings of how powerful exponential growth rate can be are right on track. The thesis that it is easy to misjudge this type of growth has also been proven by the volumes of misguided criticism that the report engendered.”

Matt Simmons went back, looked at everything the Club of Rome said and found they were far more right than wrong.

==What influence has oil had on agriculture? What effects have oil and gas had on agriculture &amp; food distribution==
It is approximately fifty years since horses finally disappeared completely from commercial agriculture. In that time crop yields have increased phenomenally. Wheat for example increased from 1 to 1.5 tonnes to the acre to 3 to 3.5 tonnes to the acre, with the better farms achieving nearer 4.5 tonnes. This increase duplicated across many crops throughout the world is what has enabled the growth in population [discussed earlier - need to amend or build in earlier section].

Yet the United Kingdom has become less self sufficient in food down to 64% for all food in 2004 (John Nix, Farm Management Pocketbook 36th edition) meaning that our food supply is much more reliant on other countries.  When oil is plentiful and cheap, this isn't a problem - and indeed, that's exactly why our self-sufficiency has declined. 

The supermarkets themselves didn't exist as a significant force until the 1950s and they have grown their reach and perfected their centralised distribution systems on the back of cheap oil and gas. Next time you go into a supermarket just think about how much energy is being used keeping those open decked chillers running and the freezers and the lighting 24/7, let alone the amount of energy used to shift lorry load after lorry load around the country.

Lifestyles have also changed. People lead more rushed lifestyles and food often takes a back seat, squeezed into the day, with many people picking food up on the run and grabbing an energy intensive chilled or frozen ready meal from the supermarket on the way home from work. Processed foods have become the norm with only a minority of the younger generation with the desire, time or skills to cook an indigenous food meal from scratch from fresh and basic ingredients. Cars have enabled people to do a big shop once a week and with the use of the refrigerator and the freezer in some cases once a fortnight or once a month. Diet has become more varied with exotics such as pineapples and mangos widely available and fine green beans from places like Kenya and Thailand available year round by the use of exceptionally energy intensive air freight.

The average spend on food as a percentage of average income has also dropped significantly in this time meaning that people have more to spend on other things such as cars (consume energy), central heating systems (consume energy), entertainments (consume energy). Cheap food has come about for various reasons; commonly attributed to the cheap food policies followed by governments and the increasing competition of the supermarkets, the effect on food prices of cheap oil and gas for production and distribution is frequently overlooked. The reality is that cheap food would never have existed without cheap energy, nor would the supermarkets or the cars or the refrigerators in every home.

During the twentieth century for the first time in the history the total of energy use from seed to plate has vastly exceeded the energy consumed. [source?]

'''Production'''

Originally farms produced all their own energy. Cultivation was carried out by horses which were fed on grass and grain produced on the farm. Horses usually required 20% to 25% of the land in both grass and grain to provide their food requirements. Fertilisers were non existent other than via manure from livestock kept on the farm. All farms were mixed farms, right across the UK. Now the eastern counties are predominantly arable or crop farming and the western counties predominantly livestock, meaning that livestock products such as meat and milk have to be transported east and south to their markets and crop products such as feed wheat have to be transported west to their markets. The only exception to this is industrial poultry and pig farming where the animals are largely kept indoors and these farms tend to be predominantly in the eastern grain producing regions. Vegetables are mainly grown in and around the Wash in Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire and Norfolk where the soil is supremely suited to their production. These then have to be distributed accordingly around the country. Much of this area owes its existence to drainage systems pumped and dug and maintained first by coal and steam pumps and now by oil. Irrigation is used extensively in this area on some crops although overall the U.K's reliance on irrigation is much lower than that of many other countries, irrigation relies mostly upon diesel powered pumps to move and pump water to where it is needed.

The mechanisation that was enabled on the back of oil through tractors, combine harvesters and all the tasks that they can accomplish has significantly reduced the labour required on British farms, meaning that more people were &quot;free&quot; to go off and seek their living in other industries. The mechanisation meant that timeliness was increased, and therefore only two or three different crop species were a possibility on a big farm. Even a small tractor can plough more in an hour than a team of horses and work for more hours a day.

Originally everything was organic because there was no other way to be.  Then early in the twentieth century guano, a deposit of bird faeces rich in Nitrogen with some Potash and Phosphate content, was found in abundance on cliffs in places such as Peru and Africa. This was mined and transported to other countries where its value as a fertiliser was soon realised. As with all natural substances used on a large scale this commodity soon could not keep up with the demand and other substitutes were found. Nitrogen fertiliser based on the Haber-Bosch process was soon in use on a wide scale. This process uses large quantities of natural gas.

Soon after the Second World War a lot of effort was put into finding chemicals to control weeds, pests and diseases. These chemicals are also reliant on oil for feedstock and for the energy to manufacture, distribute and apply them. Seed breeding and development has been thanked for a great deal of the increases in yields and is probably the least energy intensive part of the new style of agriculture. However a lot of the varieties that have been bred have been very successful when supplied with copious quantities of fertiliser and pesticides and it remains to be seen how many of them are viable without these inputs.


==What influence has oil had on population?==
http://altbuzz.org/public/peak_oil/world_population.jpg
[[Image:http://altbuzz.org/public/peak_oil/world_population.jpg]]

This graph says it all. Oil has been incredible for the human population. It has improved healthcare, agriculture, trade, water supplies and shelter, and for these reasons people have been living longer and mortality rates have decreased. It has created an artificial carrying capacity for the world. Oil increased the quantity of people we were able to sustain, but when oil goes into decline, it is not hard to consider that population will go into a decline too. Whether this is sudden or gradual will vary around the world.

==Can’t Saudi Arabia pump more?==

The true answer here is that outside of Aramco (the Saudi Arabian public oil company) nobody really knows. Some argue (most prominently Matt Simmons in &quot;Twighlight in the Desert&quot;) that there is evidence that Saudi is nearing its peak of production and has in all probability passed its peak of light sweet crude (low sulfur and shorter carbon chains - far easier to refine). Others, including Aramco officials argue that Saudi production can be raised over a period of time to greater than 15 million barrels per day (it is currently around 9.5 million barrels a day).

We do know that most of the big Saudi fields were found over 40 years ago and that they have been producing for tens of years. Very little significant reserves have been found in the past few decades.

We also know that Saudi is the world's last swing producer. A swing producer is a country that can increase its production to cover for short term supply disruptions elsewhere. The rest of the world is pretty much pumping as fast as they can. If Saudi does peak then the world will have almost certainly reached a global peak but even before that time, Saudi needs to increase its production at a rate higher than the global decline to stave off the global peak - something that gets progressively harder as more fields and countries start to decline, while demand continues to grow.

Until we have publicly available field by field data from the Saudi oil wells, the only way to know how much Saudi can produce is to wait and watch.

==The markets will sort it out.==
A number of factors come into play discussing the role of the markets and solutions to the coming energy crisis - 1) are theoretical free market principles reflected in our current society 2) to what extent are energy costs factored into the markets 3) to what extent do we commit the cardinal sin of using past performance to predict the future 4) how will supply and demand work in the energy crisis 5) what are the limits to market capitalism 6) how will our reliance on debt and growth be effected.

1) for markets to function properly there needs to be transparency of information and an absence of coercion or undue influence.

2) considering virtually all of the raw materials used in energy production, space heating and transport are finite, and for the vast majority, their cost of production does not factor in the millions of years of sunlight, heat and pressure required to make them, their true value is not reflected in their market price. In essence the last hundred years have been the equivalent of the ground giving people $100 a barrel and us having to pay back $10 for it. Our current market model has not been subjected to a situation where a fair price is paid for fuel inputs, it can then be argued that our current model is theoretically if not practically flawed. Perhaps it will work when energy costs reflect their true price of production but our testing of its robustness have historically not included these pressures.

3) the technological and medical advances that have been possible over the last few hundred years through the availability of cheap fossil fuels have lead the human race to fall into the trap of predicting the future to be a continuation of the status quo. Humans have become arrogant in the belief that we can overcome any obstables placed in our path. Our belief is that our ability to invent technologies for any eventuality is unlimited. A key to financial theory is not to see past performance as an indication of future performance.

4) supply will always match demand (in a market with an unregulated price) but the emphasis needs to be placed on the supply being the determining factor rather than the demand. Due to a few hundred years of the ability to increase supplies (of most things) to meet demand, the usual focus on the supply and deman equilibrium is on the demand side. Peak oil will cause a supply constraint. The only possible outcome is demand destruction - i.e. the price of oil, as it becomes more scarce, will rise so that more and more people simply can't afford to buy any.

5) our current guise of the free market, i.e. capitalism, has the ability of infinite growth as one of its fundamentals. If you are of the belief the land and resources are finite then you will understand that when these are no longer freely available then the model begins to crumble. It takes a true hard headed capitalist to believe that the earth and the beings on it have an infinite potential to expand.

6) Our debt based (mortgages, loans, bonds) society's continued viability is predicated on growth - between 2 and 3 percent a year on average, and that growth it can be argued is dependent on cheap fuel sources. The energy crisis therefore has the potential to destroy our capital markets; now whilst this does not necessarily mean that the theoretical market will not continue, it may mean that our global market as we know it now may cease to exist or be radically changed.

==We’ll find something better, won't we?  We always find a better fuel!==
Not always. For example, in the case of Easter Island, wood was their major fuel source. They used it all up and there was nothing to replace it. Until the industrial extraction of coal, Britain experienced plenty of wood shortages, and there were decades where use of wood was limited. We went from wood to coal, and then oil and gas. Nuclear also emerged making a small overall contribution. But there is nothing we know of that is better than oil or as flexible as oil.

==Does the market have a role to play?==
The market can be considered to be reactionary not proactive. In that sense solutions tend to be found when problems arise and someone comes up with an idea that they feel they can make a profit on. As such the market tends to be short sighted. It could then be argued that declining oil production is a problem that needs longer term thinking and planing and therefore, a reactionary system such as the free market will not be suitable mechanism for change by itself. However, as part of an overall effort to a more sustainable, post peak society it is possible that the free market might have a role to play if it is integrated in with other measures. Although, there are some people who would argue that it should not be part of a solution as it will allow those with more spending power to force a solution for themselves rather than opting for an overall strategy that benefits society as a whole.

==Necessity is the mother of invention. Technology will save us. Somebody will think of something.==
The magical technology fairy saves the day. Seems like a good plan to me, let’s not do anything because someone else with think of something. We will invent the technology to save us all! OK, sarcasm aside, the obvious problem there is basing our hopes on something yet to be invented. That’s putting our faith in something that doesn’t exist. Maybe it will work, maybe it won’t but a wise course of action would be to assume that it doesn’t and plan accordingly. Then you will be covered both ways. It doesn’t take much of a look at history to find that there are plenty of examples where new technology doesn’t actual do much more than make the situation worse. For example, new machinery introduced into a factory that then breaks down or requires more effort to maintain than the old machinery. It could suffer from a bit of teething trouble. There is also the problem of time. We can make a good guess as to what is coming our way and we know that we need to act now and there is no time to wait. There is not much activity at the moment in research to find alternative technologies for a post carbon world. Most research is aimed at developing technology to maximise company’s profits or in some way or other to keep going as we are. When it is realised that we can’t it may be far too late to develop new technologies even if such things could be developed.

Now, lets go back to the beginning. The problem we are dealing with is not so much a technology problem but an energy problem. Anything and everything we do requires energy and post peak there is a good possibility that we will be running short of energy. Technology does not make energy it can only use it. We already know what energy we have available and how to use it. We also have the technology to use it more efficiently. Therefore, it can be argued that we do not need any new technology to tackle this problem. It can then be argued that we need to look at the way we are doing things and change or socio-economic system rather than trying to invent new things to keep partying a little longer.

Another thing to consider is that we wouldn’t be in the position of an oil dependent world if the invention of the mass produced automobile hadn’t occurred – the invention of the car led to it becoming a necessity, and now we find ourselves in the position we are in!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==After oil, what next?==
That’s what we all would like to know! We can't predict the future but we can make some educated guesses. One of which is to say that whatever the future has in store for us it may well be very different to the world we live in today. We can get some clues form what is happening today. We have alternative energy sources such as wind and solar but they are intermittent and will not meet our current needs but perhaps they could be combined with energy farms. There is nuclear but that leaves a lot of nasty waste to handle and is in itself just another finite resource and will also peak exactly as oil will. There are bio fuels but they, like, wind and solar, will not be able to meet our current needs. So, what ever next maybe it will probably be a world with a mixture of energy sources combined with ways to reduce our energy needs. Maybe that will mean more reliance on local communities maybe it will be more like a “Mad Max” world. We don’t know but its up to us how we shape the future. We are now going to look at a whole range of potential energy sources for the future, but a couple of things will remain clear. The first is that finding a direct replacement for oil is not easy and that most of our options only produce electricity. The second is that the laws of thermodynamics are very important to consider.

==What are the laws of thermodynamics?==
'''Law 1.''' You don’t get something for nothing. Or more technically, the energy you put into a system is equal to the energy you get out plus the energy you lose in the system. This means that energy is conserved, that there is no energy magical appearing out of nowhere.

'''Law 2.''' If you want to keep something running you got to put energy into it. That is, a closed system will run down and come to a halt unless you keep adding energy to it (then it won’t be closed!). Another way of saying this is to say that the entropy of the system increases. The result of this law is all around us when you see things degrading and needing maintenance.

'''Law 3.''' The colder things are the less energy they lose. So, if you could freeze a system down to the coldest you can get then the entropy of that system would be constant.

==What about non-conventional oil?==
Fossil fuels come in a range of forms from coal to natural gas. 'Conventional Oil' generally refers to easily flowing oils - and some definitions restrict the term to on-shore or shallow-water oil. Conventional oil is the easiest to extract and the easiest to use. Non-conventional oils range from heavy oil (thick and more difficult to both extract and refine) to tar sands. Another form of non-conventional 'oil' is 'oil shale' - in fact not a form of oil at all but nearer to the form that organic materials take before heat and pressure creates oil from them.

There are very large amounts of both tar sands and oil shales in the USA and Russia. However extraction of these and conversion into usable oil is not easy. Using current methods (in development for over 25 years) both require a large input of energy - and in the case oil sands - large quantities of water. Whilst there is an overall gain in energy - it is neither quick nor easy to produce oil from either of these sources. Furthermore, especially in the case of oil-sands, there is a substantial environmental impact.

Whilst production from heavy oils and oil-sands is increasing current projections are that these will not make up the shortfall as conventional oil production starts to fall. Oil shale has yet to be produced on commercial scale.

==What about renewables such as solar and wind?==
The current forms of solar and wind energy produce electricity. This, of course, could be used either to produce hydrogen (or some other form of energy carrier) or to charge batteries in electric cars.

The current focus on these renewables is to try to replace conventional (fossil fueled) generation to reduce CO2 emissions. At present, however, demand for electricity is increasing [insert figure or graphic] - and the rapidly increasing implementation of new solar and wind generation systems isn't even covering new demand, let alone replacing conventional generation. The point is that irrespective of peak oil we also have an issue on conventional power generation.  So to tackle both this issue and peak oil would require immensely larger programmes. By way of example roughly 4% of the UK's land area and 50,000 3MW wind turbines would be require to replace current electricity generation (Energy Beyond Oil, Paul Mobbs). To replace oil energy requires roughly the same amount [compare to current govt targets].

If electricity is used to generate hydrogen, and that hydrogen is then used to propel a vehicle, roughly 75% of the energy is wasted through conversion losses. The same applies to oil as cars are only 25% efficient - the rest of the energy ends up as heat. Use of the electricity to charge electric cars is more efficient, and also avoids the complexities of producing, transporting and storing hydrogen (although other chemical forms of energy storage are being developed).

Technology has been developed that will produce hydrogen directly from sunlight and attempts are being made to increase the efficiency of this. At present it isn't commercially viable.

So renewables could help - but would require a massive increase in implementation, for which there may simply not be enough sites. It would also require changes in vehicles and infrastructure to move the energy around.

==What about renewables such as tidal or wave?==
These are potentially major sources of energy in some parts of the world. The UK is fortunate in having both in large quantities on tap. However these are not easy to convert into electricity and many of the arguments that apply to wind also apply to tidal and wave energy.

Water is not a forgiving medium and equipment that is designed to operate in rough seas has to be very robust and is also difficult and expensive to maintain. There are, however, a number of methods being developed to extract energy from both tide and wave. The tidal barrage is well established approach but has substantial environmental consequences. Tidal lagoons have also been mooted. Tidal stream devices (a propeller connected to a generator) are in development. Wave solutions also are being developed and there are now implementations going ahead.

However the total amount of energy we can extract in this way using currently perceived developments is still small compared to the energy we get from oil. By way of example The Royal Commission on Environmental Polution estimated that 4GW of power could be delivered by tidal stream in the UK (which is well endowed with potential sites). This is only about 10% of current electricity use in the UK...and a much smaller proportion of our oil usage (let alone gas).

==What about bio-fuels?==
Biofuels are going to be an important source of fuel for the future. Until the onset of fossil fuels bio-mass in the shape of wood, dung, straw and much more was, along with the sun and

&quot;In 2003, the biologist Jeffrey Dukes calculated that the fossil fuels we burn in one year were made from organic matter “containing 44×10 to the 18 grams of carbon, which is more than 400 times the net primary productivity of the planet’s current biota.”(1) In plain English, this means that every year we use four centuries’ worth of plants and animals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2005/12/06/worse-than-fossil-fuel&lt;/ref&gt;

One calculation suggests we would need to use all of Britain’s current agricultural land to meet its current energy needs by using biomass.

A report from the E.U simply stated “You can feed either cars or people, but not both.”  [source?]

==What about gas and Liquid Natural Gas?==
Gas is expected to peak 10 years after oil, so it is not any long term solution. It is also prone to sharper decline rates and is much more difficult to transport, hence the push for Liquefied Natural Gas as the choice for countries around the world with an increasing appetite for gas from far away countries. Transporting LNG by tanker is arguably cheaper than building pipe lines but there are many infrastructure problems such as building LNG ships and terminals. Gas is an incredibly important feedstock for fertiliser and many believe it is the decline of gas that we have to worry more about.

==What about the hydrogen economy?==
Stories in the media will often crop up about cars running on water. There is no car that runs on water, but what these stories are referring to is ‘The Hydrogen Economy’ – a future where the world is powered by emission-free Hydrogen. The key thing though is that unlike fossil fuels, Hydrogen isn’t an energy source – it is an energy carrier. It is a battery. You have to use energy both to getting it, and getting power into it. Despite Hydrogen being the most abundant element in the universe, it is incredibly hard to get in any usable form.

The laws of physics mean the hydrogen economy will always be an energy sink. Hydrogen’s properties require you to spend more energy to do the following than you get out of it later: overcome waters’ hydrogen-oxygen bond, to move heavy cars, to prevent leaks and brittle metals, to transport hydrogen to the destination. It doesn’t matter if all of the problems are solved, or how much money is spent. You will use more energy to create, store, and transport hydrogen than you will ever get out of it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.powerswitch.org.uk/portal/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=483&amp;Itemid=2&lt;/ref&gt;

Any diversion of declining fossil fuels to a hydrogen economy subtracts that energy from other possible uses, such as planting, harvesting, delivering, and cooking food, heating homes, and other essential activities. According to Joseph Romm “The energy and environmental problems facing the nation and the world, especially global warming, are far too serious to risk making major policy mistakes that misallocate scarce resources.

Optimistic studies on the use of hydrogen as a fuel usually fail, for example, to take into account the storage costs associated with a highly compressed gaseous fuel. Hydrogen has such a low fuel value per unit volume that it is difficult to ship or pump meaningful quantities of energy from point to point.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.powerswitch.org.uk/portal/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=834&amp;Itemid=2&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a joke about Hydrogen.  &quot;Hydrogen is the fuel of the future, and it always will be.&quot;

==What about nuclear fission?==
Nuclear fission is a highly emotive energy source. Statistically it is one of the safest forms of energy in terms of deaths per energy unit produced. However we are facing an immense backlog of nuclear waste to deal with, huge decommissioning costs for old power stations and leaving a radioactive legacy that spans 1000s of years into the future. There are also risks of nuclear proliferation.

There are also concerns over the availability of Uranium as current high-density reserves will run out in the next 30 years.

New designs and approaches massively reduce waste and decommissioning costs, however these are not eliminated. There are also ways of re-processing uranium, or using Thorium, or implementing breeder-reactors that massively increase the amount of energy (50 times or more) that can be derived from the same amount of input fuel. These would all require considerable development and come with new waste and safety issues.

In principle, if these issues could be overcome, nuclear power could produce a large amount of energy. Even so the scale the need should not be under-estimated. To replace, say, 25% of the UK's current oil consumption would require electricity from about 20 nuclear power stations.

==What about fusion?==
Whereas current Nuclear Power is based on Nuclear Fission – splitting the atom – Nuclear Fusion is based on fusing atoms together. More specifically, two light atomic nuclei fuse together to form a heavier nucleus and release energy.&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Fusion power|&quot;Fusion power&quot; at ''Wikipedia'', March 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the same kind of reaction that sustains the Sun. It is also the basis of the Hydrogen Bomb. It could be used to generate tremendous amounts of electricity and little high level radioactive waste. The idea is not new, but unlike Nuclear Fission, the breakthroughs in creating a self-sustaining Nuclear Fusion Power Plant have not happened despite $20billion spent over 40 years on research. Even Nuclear Fusion’s staunchest advocates say it is many decades away at best. There are tremendous technological challenges to overcome. For example, the temperature in the reactors would be about 100-200 million Kelvin, and there is no known material that can withstand that level of heat for a fraction of a second. There has been no nuclear fusion reactor that has produced more energy than it consumes. It will not be until 2016 – possibly later – that the big hope, the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor;) experimental fusion reactor will be operational. It will then be many years until we will even get close to anything commercially viable. And even then it only produces electricity, not oil, so we will have to have transport in place that can run on an electric grid. Assuming that all the breakthroughs necessary do happen, it will not be until mid-21st century that Nuclear Fusion could be in place, and by then the world will be a very different place. We would hope that we would be well on our way to creating a truly sustainable world by then. Some also that if Nuclear Fusion, or some other miracle power comes along, all it will do is enable humanity to carry on exploiting the world’s resources.

==What about coal, especially ‘clean coal’?==
Coal will undoubtedly become a major part of the energy mix, regardless of the decline of oil. For example, in China they are building a new coal power station every week. Coal is cheap and for many countries such as China and America is in large abundance. However, there is no doubt that this threatens our intentions to mitigate climate change. Coal itself is subject to peaks - for example, coal is expected to peak in the U.S.A by 2032.

==What about geothermal energy?==
Geothermal energy is a useful source of heat and energy for the countries that possess it. It has been used commercially for many years is several countries, including Iceland, Italy, New Zealand, Phillipenes and the USA. However, it has been limited to locations close to volcanic activity and so has not been a major source of energy.  The future lies with hot dry rock or enhanced geothermal systems (EGS).  Deep holes are drilled, water pumped down and then extracted after heating by the hot rocks below.  The energy theoretically available is enormous.&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Geothermal power|&quot;Geothermal power&quot; at ''Wikipedia'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

==What about free energy?==
There are people who claim that there are ways of creating power that bypasses the first law of thermodynamics - that energy cannot magically appear out of nowhere, or even from background ambient energy. The simple fact is there is no demonstrable, scientifically proven example of such a device working that produces more energy than it consumes. Free energy makes up precisely 0% of the world’s energy contribution. Some say that free energy devices have been hushed up and hidden by the U.S government. This doesn’t make sense. Economies grow based on energy growth. The more energy there is, the more economies can grow. If there was a way of producing free energy, there is no rational reason for with-holding such a breakthrough. If economic problems are one of the main reasons for governments to lose elections, then it would make sense to make use of every energy source possible. It also assumes that free-energy inventions can only occur in America! There are many energy-poor countries in the world that would not hesitate to make use of free energy inventions. Cheap, clean, free energy is the holy grail for energy research and it hasn't been found.

==What about methane hydrates?==
Methane Hydrates, otherwise known as Methane Ice or Methane Clathrate is ice that contains a lot of methane within its structure. There are very large deposits of methane hydrates on the ocean floor. Methane is a natural gas so exploiting this resource is very attractive to the oil and gas industry. However, there is no commercially operating methane hydrate extraction process. Methane, of course, is a greenhouse gas, ten times more effective than carbon dioxide. It is thought that changes in sea-level during previous ice-ages ld to methane being released from the hydrates causing global warming. Drilling for methane hydrates is a hazardous process with &quot;many floating drilling platforms having been lost in shallow waters when a gas pocket was penetrated before the blow out preventer was installed… Being a solid, methane in oceanic hydrates cannot migrate and accumulate in deposits sufficiently large to be commercially exploited. The published estimates of the size of the resource are highly unreliable and give flawed comparisons with conventional fossil fuels. There are other non-conventional sources of gas which are infinitely more reliably known and accessible than hydrates, yet remain uneconomic for the time being. The prospects for the commercial production of oceanic hydrates in foreseeable future are negligible. In short, they are a chimera.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dieoff.org/page192.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==What about turning waste into oil?==
There is a process called Thermal Depolymerization which mimics the natural geological processes that produces fossil fuels. By using biomass waste and putting it under intense pressure and heat, the process creates light crude oil. After a long period of development the process now produces more energy than it consumes. A working plant in Missouri is thought to turn 200 tons of turkey waste each day into 500 barrels of oil. The USA creates 12 billion tonnes of waste each year. Obviously the amounts of oil produced by different types of waste varies, but assume that it was 12 billion tonnes of turkey waste, it would still only produce 30 million barrels of oil a year. America consumes more than that amount of oil in 2 days at the moment. Triple it and you still only get a week’s worth of oil for the most wasteful country in the world. And that is the point – it depends entirely on a society that produces waste. If we assume the world of the future will be in a harsher economic climate, then we can assume it will produce less waste. It may be that turkey guts are better served as a feedstock to other animals such as dogs and cats! Equally it relies on energy inputs, and the cost of gas involved in the heating process is going to go up, as will the cost of transporting the waste to the TDP plant and then transporting the oil from the TDP plant. Thermal Depolymerization is a useful process but it will contribute very little.

==Are all these alternatives useless then?==
They will all be part of an increasingly diverse energy mix, but even combined, they will not be able to replace the decline of oil.

==What about increasing efficiency?==

What may seem a common sense solution is to make everything dependent on energy more efficient. Jevon’s Paradox states that as the efficiency of something such as fuel is increased, total consumption of the resource actually increases rather than decreases because it makes more available, at a cheaper price.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox (March 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

So, if you made a car’s petrol usage twice as efficient and the cost of the fuel remained the same, you’d be getting the twice the amount of fuel for your money, in effect. However, this decreases demand so the cost of fuel drops, making it more accessible to others, thus increasing consumption. You get better usage from the fuel but it doesn’t mean that less is used. Jevons noticed this in his 1865 book “The Coal Question”. Consumption of coal soared when James Watt’s coal-fired steam engine was introduced. It was more efficient that Thomas Newcomen’s earlier design so it was more cost-effective, therefore more people could afford it, and it could be more widely adopted by industry. As a result, overall coal consumption rose even though less coal was required than before to do the same work.

Some say that Jevons Paradox ceases to apply once we past the oil peak As the price of oil continues to rise, to maintain the same standards of living for the same cost, efficiency must increase.

==How is oil linked to economic growth?==
http://www.peakoil.net/uhdsg/weo2004/OilDemandAndGDP.jpg

This graph from the World Energy Outlook 2004 shows clearly the link between Oil Demand and GDP growth.

==Is this more of an economic crisis than an energy crisis?==

The two are inextricably linked. Just as a crisis which is solely economic will reduce energy consumption, so a crisis that is solely based on a lack of energy will cause economic recession. Whilst peak oil will create both an economic and an energy crisis, it is the basic flaw in the conventional wisdom of modern economics which has created it: the belief in year on year economic growth in a finite world. A lack of understanding of the power of the exponential function (the increase of anything by a percentage amount) has led to business, academics and policy makers becoming disconnected from the effects of economic growth.

It is also important to understand that an oil crisis does not just affect energy prices, oil is important for almost every part of the economy.

==Hasn’t economic growth been decoupled from energy growth?==
No. Economic growth cannot be decoupled from energy growth, there is, and always will be a correlated relationship between what an economy produces and how much energy it uses. This relationship is of course different for different industries and different countries, some are more energy intensive and so the relationship may be equal, and others biased towards less energy intensive industries like the service industry will use less energy for every percentage increase in energy use. Currently world economic growth is around 3-4%, whilst world primary energy demand is projected to expand by more than half between now and 2030, an average annual growth rate of 1.6%&lt;ref&gt;International Energy Agency Report, ''World Energy Middle East and North Africa Insights 2005'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;. Some point to the oil shocks of the 1970s and to current high oil prices and ask why there has not been a recent economic recession, what this fails to take into account is the fact that oil prices were much higher in the 1970s if inflation adjusted.

==How is money created?==
Banks loan money into existence, when you or I put £100 into a bank £10 of it is kept by the bank, the rest is loaned to businesses and people. So now you have £100 in your bank account, and someone else has a £90 loan, and the bank has kept £10 to cover withdrawals, so in effect there is now £190 in existence where only £100 existed before you went to the bank. This cycle of deposit and loan continues until the original deposit has created about six times its original amount in money terms. Banks expect interest to be paid on the amount they loan out, more than they pay you or deposits. But interest can only be paid if the loans banks make are successful themselves in making money.

==What will happen to the financial system once everyone realises we’ve peaked?==
Money is an expression of energy, an exchange medium for work and products and financial system enables the transfer of that energy around the economy. Lets say you take out a loan to buy computers to sell in your computer shop. It takes ten times the weight in fossil fuels to make a computer, so each of the 5kg computers is 50kg of fuel. Lets say the price of oil rises, and your computers are now a third more expensive to buy, which you pass on in the sale price. Now not all of your computers sell because people have less disposable income after an oil price hike, and you cannot pay back the loan plus interest. You default on the loan. You don’t pay your suppliers and they default on their loans. Banks realize that much of the money they leant out will not be returned, they stop loaning anyone else money, and decide their existing loans must be recalled, sending more companies and individuals into bankruptcy. People begin to lose faith in the banking system and demand their money from their accounts. But remember, banks loan out 90% of the money they take in, so if everyone wants their money the bank cannot hope to pay. Riots break out as the banks are besieged by people who want their cash before the bank’s reserves are drained, to see an example of this look at Argentina’s bank run of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Argentine_economic_crisis_(1999-2002)#The_crisis|&quot;Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)&quot; at ''Wikipedia'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Can we see what is going to happen by what has gone before?==
There are some recent historical precedence that can be used to gain some idea what might happen. The situation in Cuba is probably the most important. When the former Soviet Union collapsed Cuba found itself with out a regular supply of oil. They were dependent on oil from the Soviet Union for things such as electric power production and food. The situation there deteriorated and they found themselves with regular power cuts and food shortages. The energy intake from food for the average Cuban was reported to have declined by about a third when compared to before the collapse of the Soviet Union.

To get through the crises Cuba turned to the community solution of cooperation coupled with organic growing techniques. They introduced organic hydroponics called organoponics, which uses only organic fertilisers fermented from urine and worm farms. They also introduced other methods such as permaculture to produce food. They developed bio-pesticides and grew food wherever they could, even converting old car parks into growing areas in the towns. For transportation they reverted to cycling and walking as well as aiming for more energy efficient public transport system. A new revelation swept through Cuba and it worked. Cuba successfully survived the transition and has become a model of what can be achieved by working together and Cuba can be seen as an example of a post carbon state.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalpublicmedia.com/articles/657&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalpublicmedia.com/interviews/649&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energybulletin.net/13171.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Have we ever experienced anything like this before?==
No. We have never in human history had a civilisation that ran on oil. We have never been so dependent on such a single source of energy and we have never had such an abundance of cheap energy before. This civilisation in it's current form has been built on a mineral slime like no other civilisation before it. Civilisations have come and gone before and we have had dependencies on various types of minerals and land usage before but not on oil. We have never faced a situation where we have put all our eggs into one basket and than faced a situation where it started to run out!

However, there are some historical precedence that, although they are not the same situation, do have aspects that can give us an indication of what might lie ahead. On of which is what happen in Cuba after they lost their oil supply due to the collapse of the Soviet Union. The collapse of the Soviet Union, itself, is another situation that we can draw lessons from. So is the population collapse on Easter Island. We could also draw some ideas what we might be in store form the oil shock of the early 1970s and maybe even from the famines in eastern Europe during the 1930s as well as the depression before the Second World War.

So, although this situation is unique in human history there are past events that we can look at. They may not be exactly what we are up against now but they do have element that maybe found in our current and future situation.&lt;ref&gt;''Collapse : how societies choose to fail or succeed'' by Jared M. Diamond. Viking, cop. 2005. ISBN: 0-670-03337-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Will it be anything like the fuel protests of 2000?==
Maybe. As the price of oil increases we could expect to see some sort of fuel protests. However, even though the bulk of the fuel price at the pumps is tax the underlining reasons for a price rise due to peak oil is physical not political. As such there is only so far that any government can go to alleviate any rise in prices. Those countries with a high rate of tax have the ability to soften the rising cost for a limited time and those countries with low tax will notice the rise in price first. So, in the end, no matter how much fuel protests there are the price of oil will most likely rise in the long term and the fuel protests of 2000 may well end up looking like minor irritation but nothing significant in comparison!

==Will oil and other energy prices just keep on going up?==
With demand increasing but supply decreasing, what we will see is oil and other energy prices rising and rising until an economic recession is induced, creating ‘demand destruction’ through the closure of businesses and increasing unemployment. This downward spiral of decreasing economic activity will lower prices because usage will be lowered. However, at a certain point there will be a recovery with the whole process being repeated. Even in the absence of recovery as the decreasing supply crosses the depressed demand line, price will rise, creating deeper depression. It will be an ongoing process of prices going up and down, but when they go down it is not because of increased supply but because the economy is in decline. It is maybe for this reason that it is wise to invest early in having microgeneration installed for your property.

==Does peak oil increase the potential for conflict?==
With the arrival of the peak of oil and gas production, we can expect to see a series of deepening global recessions, culminating in depression due to our dependence on fossil fuels. Throughout this time there will be large pressures placed on our current ways of life, pressures that will either dictate a voluntary change in the way our society works, or, should we chose to reject that course, a series of conflicts and wars over the lessening scraps around the world. This later route, at its best, will be a more painful means of reaching the same low energy society, at worst...depends how far things escalate, but we may not get there at all.

From time immemorial wars have been fought over resources. Actually, virtually all of them: from the expansion of the Roman Empire, to French, Spanish, Portuguese and British Imperialism, to the Japanese conquest of Manchuria, to Soviet expansionism, to the Iraq invasion of Kuwait, and the British and US invasion of Iraq.

With virtually every aspect of the world's people and lives reliant on oil and gas, the stakes are raised. The arguments will be more subtle (&quot;Our way of life is not negotiable&quot;), the bogey men more terrifying (&quot;The Hitler of our time&quot;), the consequences of military inaction more disastrous (&quot;40 minutes&quot;).

The last great depressions in the 1920s and 1930s were firmly felt in Germany and the United States. The Nazis played the scapegoat card to support their expansionist policies. The resultant war dragged the United States out of its depression. Everyone would have preferred a different way out to the estimated 55 000 000 deaths.

==Is peak oil related to the ‘War on Terror’?==
Lets look at the facts. Fact one, world oil production will peak, for definite in the next 30 years, and very likely much sooner. Fact two, the US depends on control of the world’s energy supplies to ensure economic growth and consolidate its position as the only superpower. Fact three, Europe and the US have been meddling in Middle Eastern politics since days of empire. Fact four, the US’s government is controlled by people who have a lot to gain by increased military spending.

There can be very little doubt that peak oil and the War on Terror are related, just how related is open for debate. There are two levels of theory about the relationship between the War on Terror and peak oil. The first is that Al-Queada’s attacks are a useful and co- incidental part of a plan to gain more control over the world’s energy resources, the second is that Al-Quaeda’s actions were known about and possibly encouraged in the run up to 9/11 by elements of the Bush administration in order to bring about conditions for the use of force. There are many unanswered questions about what happened on 9/11, such as the destruction of building number 7 at the World Trade Center and the failure to scramble intercept aircraft, amongst others. To do this subject justice would require another book, so I won’t write anymore.

==What effect will this have on the economy?==
That can be difficult to say but there are various scenarios that are possible. Peak oil could actually be a good thing in the short term. As oil prices rise it may well become cheaper to produce goods locally which could be a boost to local economies, as more jobs become available. Governments could also invest in new ways of doing things and implement effective. Individuals and private groups could form an important part of new initiatives. Society could move over easily to a more sustainable way of living and we may hardly notice a difference. Other scenarios could be a recession or a depression, which may result from a slow response by governments and other agencies. However, even after a slow start our economies could be transformed into a more sustainable economic system. Another scenario is an economic collapse and civil unrest.

Whatever happens, it is unlikely that our current economic system will survive as it is. Oil is so fundamental to our economy, and we have no simple solution, that it is hard to imagine that our current system will continue as it is, as the oil prices rise. Even without peak oil it is unsustainable and will need to radically alter the way we do things.

==Why haven't the recent dramatic increases in oil price had an effect on the economy like the 70's oil shocks?==
There has long been a strange assumption (or so it seems to me and my recent interest in economics) that the world is governed by rules of economy. Economists seem to forget that their 'rules' are simply observiations of what has happened over a prolonged period of growth, therefore they ignore limits to growth, and tend to underplay the importance of the 'inputs' to our economy, such as fossil fuels etc. 

There is an interesting section of Strahan's Last Oil Shock that explains that up until the mid 1950's most economists thought that growth of the economy was caused by increases in either labour or capital. This causal link was formulated into the Cobb Douglas function. In the mid fifties Solow applied this function to the US economy as a whole and showed that growth could NOT be attributed to just labour or capital. The economy had grown more than either of those two alone could have achieved. There must be something else at work. 

It would seem that at this point, rather than wondering why there was such a huge miss-match in the figures the difference became known as the 'Solow residual' and was assumed that the gap represented 'technical advance'. They left it at that. 

Check out this definition of the Solow residual (from the London School of Economics); 
http://lse.co.uk/FinanceGlossary.asp?searchTerm=&amp;iArticleID=2308&amp;definition=solow_residual 

Imagine that!!! They are quite happy to have a huge amount of the economy unexplained! To me as a scientist that is just bloody weird. 

Anyway finally some scientists got involved after the 70's oil shocks and showed that oil was far more important to the growth of the economy. Solow's model represented energy only in terms of the money spent on it. The Solow model predicted that if energy inputs increased by 1% the economy would grow by only 0.05%!!!!! The oil shocks of the 70's proved that was ridiculous. 

The team of scientists used the old inputs (capital and labour) but also included a physical measure of the energy put into the system (oil, gas etc measured in Joules). This model they resulted in is called the Linex function. It is a fairly sophisticated function, but models the US economy really well. No more 'Solow Residual'. Kummel's Linex function showed that for 1% increase in energy the economy would grow by roughtly 0.5%. i.e. Kummel's model showed that oil was 10x more important to the economy that Solow predicted. 

The interesting thing is this. That the Solow model shows that if oil costs go up by 1% then the effect on the economy is a shrinking of 0.05%, whereas the Kummel model shows that if the amount of energy used by the economy drops by 1% then the economy shrinks by 0.5%. 10x more effect. 

Ayers took the work further and suggested that what is important to the economy is not the energy contained in the sources of energy to the economy, but the amount of energy from those sources that is turned into useful energy. i.e. thermodynamic efficiency gains can cause increases in the economy, which can result in more money being invested in R+D which can in turn increase efficiency. 

Ayers researched efficiency gains through the last century, and came up with figures for the amount of energy usefully converted to work by the economy. He fed these figures into the Kummel function and his resultant figures fit the US and Japanese curves almost identically. Amazing! So we end up with an indication that the AMOUNT of energy used by the system is far more important to the economy than the cost of the energy in the system. 

As we are aware the cost of oil has gone up some 200% since 2001, which will affect the economy, but it will be nothing like the effects of removing oil from the system. That has over 10x more influence on the economy than the price! 

A good examination of the Linex function and some clever modeling should show how much a rise in the price of oil will affect the economy. Remembering that oil is only a proportion of the energy we use, then maybe overall energy costs have gone up by 100% since 2001, and look at the advances in fuel efficiency of cars etc over that time. Maybe the effect on the economy would be a small shrinkage. However the models clearly show that actual energy received from fossil fuels is far more important than cost. 

What else is interesting is that as oil prices have been rising strongly since 2001, and the economy has been growing then something must have been contributing to the economy. I would speculate that two things have contributed to the growth of the economy in the face of rising oil prices. Increases in capital (money supply) caused by ever more irresponsible lending, and secondly increases in efficiency. If we all drove more economic cars and changed our lightbulbs we could probably even coax another couple of years of growth from the system.

==Where will conflict be for oil in the future?==
To look at where oil conflict will be in the future you need to look at where the oil will be in the future. Michael T Klare’s book ‘Resource Wars’ identifies these points of tension. The Persian Gulf, The Caspian Sea Basin and The South China seas are the main ones. However, there is also the possibility for conflict in places such as Venezuela and Mexico. Of the Persian Gulf, Klare writes “Of all the world’s oil producing areas, the Persian Gulf region is the one most likely to experience conflict…possessing nearly two-thirds of global petroleum supplies, the Gulf is certain to remain the focus of intense worldwide competition. In addition, the region is riven by a multitude of power rivalries, religious schisms and territorial disputes.”

The Caspian Basin is believed to have the second or third largest reserves of petroleum along with a vast supply of natural gas. “Caspian sea energy is clouded by ethnic and political turmoil and the emergence of a new power struggle between the United States and Russia.”

The conflict in the South China Seas could emerge from the competition for the Spratly Archipelago that stretches for hundreds of miles. Possession of these islands would enable claims to ownership of the surrounding waters and sub-sea resources where large quantities of oil and gas are expected to be. China, Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam have all established military bases while Japan is also exploring the area for energy resources.

Any conflicts in these regions will impair the supply of oil, causing price spikes and actual physical shortages.

==What is fractional reserve banking?==
This is the method that most, if not all, banks work today. Someone deposits a certain amount in the bank and then the bank loans out, usually nine times that amount, keeping the original deposit, the'fraction', in the bank is keep to pay any withdrawals that might occur. The money that is loaned out is generated, as if by magic, out of thin air and doesn’t, as such, “really exist&quot;. Almost all the money loaned out (nine times the original deposit) very quickly ends up in the banking system as another deposit - and the trick is repeated: the banks loan out another nine times more than the deposits, which themselves were created by the fractional banking system. The whole process is repeated many times and in the end the amount 'created' by the banks ends up being close to ninety times the original deposit.
The new money that was made up by the bank increases the amount of money in the system and is the primary cause of inflation. The system works so long as people believe that their deposits will be paid back when needed, which is normally the case. However, the system can fail if there is a run on the bank and more people wish to withdraw their deposits than the bank has reserves.
All the money, the original deposit and the up-to ninety times more of money created by the banks, attracts interest. Since there is no other source of new money, the interest can only be financed by yet more money created by the fractional banking system. The whole lot functions as long as economic growth generates new deposits leading to new money created by the fractional banking system at a rate sufficient to pay the interest on the money created so far. However, when growth stops or even reverses for anything but a short period of time, large scale defaults result, leading to failing banks, bankrupt businesses, loss of employment,  foreclosures on real estate, all driving a visious downward spiral.

==Will I lose my job?==
Probably not immediately. However, there are some jobs in the long-term that maybe unsecured as a result of peak oil. One could imagine, for example, jobs like airline pilot or petrol station attendant being threatened by peak oil but other jobs may also be threatened. It is possible that the world economy could go into a down turn. We could see a recession or even a depression as bad as the one in the 1930. In which case it is quite possible that most people may see their jobs under threat as we go down the down slope.

On the other hand we may also see new jobs being created. There could be, for example, more employment in local food production or indeed, any local industry as the increase in the price of oil makes it more economical to produce goods more locally. There may even be new industries of occupations formed as a result of peak oil depending on what new technologies may come about in response to a new need that is generated or how creative people are at finding solutions to problems that arise post peak.

==Will I lose my house?==
Possibly, if you have a mortgage. If peak oil was to cause a recession or even a depression, anyone in debt, not just house owners with a mortgage, could be hit, and may well feel the effects of any future rise in oil prices the hardest. This is because any rise in oil will have knock on effects such as a rise in food costs, heating and electricity costs. This would mean less money for paying back the mortgage and, therefore, threatens people homes. Coupled with a possible rise in unemployment there is a real possibility that on the down slope you may see more people having their homes reposed due to failure to pay back the mortgage.

==What will happen to my investments?==
We could see major economic problems ahead and if things go really, badly we could even see an economic collapse. In such a scenario any long term financial investments could seriously be threatened. Even if things go well and we move over to a sustainable society, long-term financial investments may not be safe. If we were to head towards a society that is more sustainable it is arguable whether or not such a socio-economic system would have the ability to grow financially. There may not be any profit for industry nor interest for bank loans so future financial investments may just remain static. It can be hard to say.

FTSE 100 stocks had an average p/e ratio of around 13, whereas FTSE 250 stocks are on 19 at their peak(1). In a non-growth scenario, which many think is the most likely, such valuations make little sense. It is more likely that valuations would fall back to perhaps p/e ratios of 2-4,  and threfore investment values reducing to between 25% and 10% of peak levels (that is equivalent to FTSE100 falling to somewhere between 1800 and 750 points - a disaster for most investors and pension funds.

There are, however, other investments that might be of more value. Investments in education, learning things that might be of use in a post peak world. Investments in activities, joining with other to start preparing for a post peak world. A world without oil is not all gloom and doom but to make it so could well depend on what we do today and what investments we make for the future.

==Hold on…pensions are investments. Are you saying I’m going to lose my pension?==
That is a very real possibility. There are many, probably some even within the pension industry, that think pensions are not as safe as they are presented. As they say in the investment industry, “past performance is no indicator of future performance”, yet on the basis of the past we predict the future. The situation with peak oil is something different to past situation so we really don’t know what will happen, but facing a recession or depression is a real possibility. If we were to have severe economic troubles one could imagine that pensions will be among the first casualties. If the economy was to collapse then pensions would have to stop or be severely limited.

(NB: maybe something about Russia in here too?)

==What will happen to my debts?==
Debts are like loyal friends they will stick with you through think and thin! It could be argued that those who are owed money will do their best to ensure that it is paid back. Thus, your debts will most likely remain. They may even become more difficult to pay back. In the great depression of the 1930s people who owed money suffered more than those without debts did. A wise course of action, therefore, could be to minimise or remove debts as much as possible and avoid getting into new debt. However, on the other hand, we could see more and more debts being cleared by people becoming bankrupt but then would that really be a better situation to be in?

==What will happen to transport?==
Post peak with a probable higher cost for oil the price of petrol at the pumps would no doubt increase. We could see the era of private, personal transport coming to an end, or at least becoming the domain of the rich. It is unlikely that bio-fuels will ever replace the level of oil we currently use. Major consumers of oil such as the airline industry could even cease to exist. Personal transport of the future may be horses and bikes! Perhaps electric cars, if the infrastructure and batteries problems can be resolved. Large scale public transport such as buses, trains and ships may take over from private cars, however travel in general is likely to be much more restricted than now. For example, the idea of commuting large distances daily to work will become impractical and unaffordable for most people.

==What will happen to agriculture?==
As we go post peak it is most likely that we will be able to use less oil based fertilisers and pesticides but that will bring in two foreseeable problems. Firstly, the cost of production might increase and food will become more and more expensive. This could be good for farmers as it might turn the industry into a profit making business again. However, the second problem is we may not be able to produce the food we need without oil based fertilisers and pesticides which has the potential to lead to starvation and famine in Europe.

To minimise the possibilities of food supply problems it maybe that we change our agricultural methods to more organic methods and we may see the introduction of systems such as permaculture. Work in this area has so far shown that there is more opportunity for work if such practices were used, and we could possibly maintain food production at adequate levels. Therefore, we could see a movement of people to the countryside. We could also see more “inner city farms” where people in the towns start producing their own food more locally. Either in their own gardens or as community projects.

==What will happen to agriculture &amp; food distribution?==

This will depend on the speed of the transition but the first thing that consumers will notice is that they are spending an increasing amount on food as a percentage of income. This is likely to have a knock on effect into other areas of expenditure reducing discretionary spending on luxuries.

We will see reduced imports in particular things mange tout from Thailand and green beans from Kenya or other such products which are air freighted into the country and have a relatively short life after harvest. There are also implications for the availability as other countries start to struggle to reach their own food requirements they will be more likely to try and grow more of what their own people can eat rather than crops that can be traded for money with which they buy food from other countries. Food security will become an issue again for all nations and they will seek to de-globalise to achieve this.

Supermarkets will increasingly losing their competitive advantages such as breadth of range and the efficiencies of centralised distribution. Chilled and frozen foods will gradually become more expensive as people will consume less luxury foods and more necessities. Diets will change as meat becomes less affordable, we will be eating more whole cereals, root vegetables and beans, less fats and sugars and significantly less processed food. Overall the diet is likely to be healthier, though much less exciting.

Customers' habits &amp; lifestyles will change as we have to start using more public transport again, the size of the shopping basket will decrease, but the frequency with which we shop will increase. We will be spending less time travelling to work as we will have to live nearer to our place of work. Consequently we will probably have more time in which to cook proper food at home, providing we don’t have to work longer hours just to keep bread on the table.

The supermarkets will fight these new trends with all their might as they have a lot invested in the continuation of business as usual but they are unlikely to be able to maintain the massive facilities they currently have for a much reduced product base and as local food produced on local farms and sold in local shops becomes very competitive once again.

We will be more interested in keeping warm &amp; keeping fed than we will anything else we will be seeking necessities over luxuries. Human expectations will be somewhat lower in terms of material wealth. Agriculture can be a source of food and of fuel for keeping warm and a new balance will have to be found between these priorities.

'''Crop production'''

The use of fertiliser is going to get very expensive because of the cost of the energy involved in producing and distributing it. Nitrogen fertiliser in particular is produced using natural gas and is already hitting record prices due to the increase in gas prices. If farmers stop using or reduce the amount of fertiliser that they use, crops will not yield as they do at the moment, this in itself has the potential to increase food prices due to the supply and demand effects driving food prices up.

'''Crop protection products'''

Pesticides are used to control weeds, pests &amp; diseases, all of which can reduce crop yields. Again the price for these products is linked to the price of oil, both as energy for manufacture and distribution but also as a feedstock in the manufacturing process.

Many people who study peak oil claim that after the peak in oil production, organic farming using no pesticides and no chemical fertilisers farming will become more normal, but early on the oil production down slope, there may be an increase in chemical and fertiliser use as prices of food go up therefore stimulating production and also as governments realise the potential impact of the food security threat, there is a possibility that they may subsidise pesticides and fertilisers to encourage them to be used, thereby keeping yields up and stopping the market from finding a natural balance.

'''Mechanisation'''

Fossil fuel is used extensively across the world for cultivation, crop protection, fertilising and harvesting using a combination of various diesel powered machines such as Tractors and Combine Harvesters. Although electrically powered agriculture machinery may be technical possible, renewable energy simply cannot replace the power of a diesel engine with existing technology. So farmers will have to decide between doing it the old way with horses or trying to maintain the status quo with tractors using bio-fuels such as oilseed rape oil produced on the farm where they are used or nearby. There are advantages to both ways, but it will depend on how much industrial infrastructure can be maintained, for example tractors go wrong and need spare parts, whereas horses are able to replicate themselves. Both routes are likely to see 20 to 50% of the land being used for energy production for the purposes of farming to produce food (crops for horse fodder on one hand and bio-diesel on the other).

We are likely to see a return to more mixed farms as crops and livestock work very well together. We will need to see the materials loop closed with all bio-degradable waste being kept in the nutrient cycle either in people own gardens or on the farms. The days of sewage going out to sea or vegetable peelings going to land fill will be gone.

If there is a return to using horses for draught work then there will be a need for significantly more people working in agriculture. Even if the bio fuels route is taken this is still likely to be the case as crops which are more labour intensive make a return to the U.K.

'''Livestock products'''

The livestock industry will also change as a lot of energy goes into all livestock products although most of it is indirectly. Dairy farming will alter because much of the increase in yield from a cow has been due to concentrate feedstuffs largely based on crops grown with fossil fuels. Cows can of course manage on diet consisting mainly of grass or stored grass in the form of hay and silage; however their milk yield is likely to be much lower. The productivity of the grassland that feeds them is also likely to drop if fertiliser input is reduced, at least in the sort term. The same applies to beef and sheep farming, all ruminants are likely to be farmed much more organically leading to lower yields, higher prices to the consumer, and potential food shortages, in milk and meat.

Poultry &amp; pig farming for eggs and meat will suffer higher input prices due to increased prices for grain. It is possible for pigs and poultry to live on scraps of waste from the house and forage around the farmyard, but they would not grow very well and it would not work commercially. Overall it may come down to can we afford meat today or will our protein have to come from beans and nuts.

==What will happen to food distribution?==
It is quite conceivable that food distribution is likely to go back to the way it was done before oil really started to drive the economy. That is local production for local consumption using very short distribution chains, market gardening becoming more competitive and people growing more of their own food. The supermarkets are likely to disappear altogether, within 50 years of peak and gradually pull back from their least efficient sites a lot sooner. Food distribution systems will change moving more by rail and sea transport.

Trade in some high value goods with a long life such as herbs, spices teas &amp; coffees will continue as it always did prior to oil; they will just become more expensive.

The end of cheap food!

==What will happen to water supplies?==
Water supplies are very oil dependent – for chemical treatment and also because water supplies are energy intensive. Pumping, cleaning and storing water requires tremendous amounts of energy, so the more energy prices go up because of oil prices going up, this will affect the cost of supplying clear water. Water is considered by many to be the main resource constraint of the 21st century, world-wide. We might be able tp live without oil but we can’t live without water. Water, like all commodities, will become more expensive.

==What will happen to healthcare?==
There are several things to think about as far as healthcare goes. First, a lot of medicines and products are reliant on oil and gas in their production. These will become more expensive and harder to obtain. Secondly, if we experience an economic crisis as expected, the reduction in tax collected means that there will be less available for national healthcare. The NHS is already under a lot of financial stress, and this will only be exacerbated further. It could be that there will be a rolling back of exactly what the NHS will deal with, while private hospitals and healthcare may gain more ground. The emphasis will be placed much more on prevention rather than cure, with health education becoming much more prevalent. Preventative healthcare can be a very low energy intensive scheme, and could be a source of wider, although lower-paid employment for the future. Such a system exists in Cuba, which is almost a perfect case study for a Post peak oil world, where &quot;Health care for every citizen&quot; has been a top priority, second only to education. Clinics and health care providers are located throughout the country even in rural areas, and care is free. The system emphasizes prevention, health education, and community medicine… Cuba's life expectancy rates and other such indications are equal to those in developed countries: Life expectancy among men is 74 years, among women 77 years; infant mortality rates are about 12 per 1,000 births.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.culturalorientation.net/cubans/health.htm (march 18th 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==What will happen to religion?==
Religion has been with us since the Stone Age. It has developed as the human race has developed since the dawn of humanity. It has survived the rise and fall of civilisations and continues today. Religion is a very human activity. It builds on our human nature, our desires and wishes, our need for control and to be controlled and our need for security. Therefore, come what may, so long as there are people around there will most likely always be religion. It may adapt, it may change, it may be reinterpreted as it has been in the past (today’s religion is not the same as it was 100 years ago) but it will most likely still go on and still be there post peak. It could even be argued that it might become a stronger influence in a post peak world. If times become harder people may turn to religion for comfort and for emotional strength so it could even be possible that we see a reverse of secularisation. When material wealth becomes harder to obtain, people may begin to look to achieve spritual wealth, with religion as the conduit to achieve that.

==What will happen to the environment?==
It could actually get better! Imagine, less pesticides around more balanced farming less plastic waste and less mono-cultures as we adopt systems like permaculture, we may see a better a cleaner environment. However, we may see more destruction to out world then we have ever done so before! Imagine society doing what ever it can to pro-long its current way of life. Imagine a society that is quite happy to destroy what we have in the way of wood land and forests, not just in the UK but world wide in an attempt to grow bio-fuels. Imagine a society that is willing to destroy the ant-arctic to get at what may be the lasts deposits of oil.

There is potential to go either way. We could have a world with a better environment or one that we spend our remaining energies destroying so we can party a little bit longer.

==What will happen to education?==
This can depend on what happens to society as a whole. Education is a long-term investment. It costs a great deal of money to educate a person and the longer a person is in education the more it will cost. The returns on that investment comes over the life time of the individual, often with those of a higher education level generating more wealth for society. However, if finances become strained due to economic problems that may result as we go down the down slope of peak oil it could well be the case that long-term investments will be one of the first areas to suffer as reactionary policies will more likely be aimed at short term survival efforts rather than securing the long term future. This could mean that education, especially higher education could suffer post peak.

==What will happen to democracy?==
It could be argued that we are already seeing the signs of the decline of democracy as a result of the “war of terror”. It could then be seen as a possibility that if the situation was to deteriorate with a break down in social order rioting and an increase in civil disobedience post peak that we could see governments resorting to more and more dictatorial powers post peak in a desperate attempt to control the situations. However, it is not necessarily the way things might go. For example, another scenario could be that the people become more involved in the way society is governed and the direction society takes as peck oil forces more focus on local communities and local solutions. In that respect society could become more democratic with more people involvement.

==What will happen to freedom?==
This can depend on how things go. The down slope and any resulting increase of oil prices may result in civil unrest. In such a situation you could imagine a government being more reactionary and attempting to maintain order by introducing more draconian measures and suspension of freedoms. However, this is by no means a certainty. A more enlightened government would be preparing for the down slope and action would have been taken before any civil unrest problems were to develop. Also individuals and groups would be acting independently to eleviate any future problems as best they could and that would lessen the probability of civil disturbance and any resulting attempt to restrict freedoms.

However, there still may be practical restrictions to freedoms such as losing the freedom to travel by car when ever you want due possible high prices of oil.

==Will trade decline?==
People have been trading since the beginning of the human race. Stone Age people maintained trade routs that stretched long distances and we have had world-wide trade long before we discovered a use for oil. It is possible that we may see a decline in world-wide trade as the cost of oil goes up. It may become more cost effective to produce goods more locally. As a result we may see more local trade even if there is a decline in world trade. That could actually mean there will be more trade on the down slop than before! However, if things go badly we could see less trade as economies go into recession or depression or even collapse but even in such scenarios some form of trading will continue even if its just barter.

==Will plastic production decline?==
Maybe, we could see a general decline in manufacturing if we were to go into a depression and plastic production might decline as a result of that. However, plastic production only takes a small amount of oil when compared to other usage. If we were to become a bit more sensible with the way we do things it is possible that we could use the remaining oil more for plastics than for other usage and, therefore, plastic production would not decline. Also, we don’t actually need oil to make plastics, we can make it from other sources so we could continue with plastic production.

However, do we really want to maintain our current level of plastic production. If we were to more to a society that is more in balance with nature, one that reduced its consumption, reused what it made and recycled the rest we could reduce plastic production and the resulting waste and still maintain a good standard of living.

==What do you mean by interdependencies?==
Like a cobweb, everything is connected to everything else! To produce the food we need we need oil to produce the oil we need people and to feed the people we need food. Stop the food we stop the oil or stop the oil and we stop the food. Now, that was an example of interdependencies and it was very simple. For such a simple example it is easy to find solutions or alternatives to keep things going. However, our society has many interdependencies and most of them are far more complex then the simplistic example given. Consequently, solutions to any break down to the interdependencies is not so easy to find!

Another way to think of the interdependencies is to think of a woven mat. It all hangs together nicely but tug at one of the lose threads and the whole thing can come undone. In some ways out society is like that. One of the lose threads that could cause society to fall apart is oil. As oil is at the root of so much of our interdependencies losing oil can mean the thread that society is woven of can come undone.

==What will happen to the law?==
It is too simplistic to say that poverty or unemployment breeds crime. There are many important factors that play a role at the same time such as perceived social inequality, previous experience of steady employment, perception of future prospects, cultural influences etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uefap.com/vocab/exercise/awl/crime.htm (march 18th 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is no doubt that a sudden drop in living standards that an economic recession can bring on increases in crime rates. A study by the Crime and Society Foundation in 2005 indicated that “The recession of the early 1980s triggered the rising murder rates of the past 25 years…People in the poorest areas were six times more likely to be murdered than those in the richest. This is because poverty is the &quot;key component to what makes one place more dangerous to live in as compared to another ““http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4348238.stm

Equally, economic recession can bring stresses on families that can lead to more broken homes which again is something said to contribute to increasing crime rates.

Argentina is a good example to look at. &quot;These days Argentines not only have to cope with their economic malaise but also what they see as its most worrying by-product: a violent crime wave that has swept the country and encouraged some to take the law into their own hands.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2242/is_1668_286/ai_n14709975&lt;/ref&gt;

This does not mean that everyone is going to become a criminal but it will create an environment where criminal acts are likely to be more common. This will take place in a context of declining taxes and decreased funding for the police, which could increase the problem. In response to this there may be harsher punishments for criminals as deterrents, with maybe a push for the reintroduction of the death penalty. Communities may take it upon themselves to self police their own areas. There is also the option for an increase in police numbers but at a lower salary (for example you could have two policeman on half the salary of a current policeman, thus getting better value for money). The danger with this is that police would possibly be face increased exposure to opportunities for corruption.

==How will this affect politics?==
Politics is all about manipulating opinions and politicians have been doing that for centuries and it is highly likely that they will continue to do so for as long as their are people around. It was noted in the ancient world that politicians often maintained contradictory opinions and nothing has changed that in the intervening centuries. Perhaps the main way that peak oil will affect politics is to give politicians another subject with which to manipulate people’s opinions on.

==Will there be civil unrest?==
This is a very real possibility. In a scenario where oil production was to decline and prices were to rise we could see the cost of, for example, the price of petrol at the pumps rising considerably. The full protest of 2000 could then bee seen as a small taste of what might come. It would not take much of an imagination to see that in such a situation things may indeed become ugly if there has not been sufficient preparation in society to handle the crises to the world economy that may result as oil prices rise. There is a possibility that we could see food prices and unemployment rising and when such things have happened in the past they have often been followed by some form of civil unrest. Civil unrest may well be the norm for the future if adequate preparations and planing are not taken today!

==Will we experience blackouts?==
Britain has an ageing fleet of power stations, and analysis suggests that perhaps the only way to avoid blackouts would be to build over 50 new coal powerstations.

==What will happen to population levels?==
Thomas Malthus predicted a population crash as a result of unbounded population growth and the failure of agriculture to keep up. His predictions did not come true. There are a number of reasons for that but the main one is that food production increased at greater rates than he anticipated. One of the reasons why we wear able to maintain high food production and feed an expositional growing population is because of pesticides and fertilisers, which are based on oil. If oil production was to decline and there was a shortage of oil or its price was to increase it does give the possibility of a population crash. Even before that there could be scenes of malnutrition before starvation is seen in the UK, Europe and even America. Such a possibility is a scenario developed by the Club of Rome. However, it is not a certainty. The application of our scientific understanding of nature could help us to produce sufficient food using methods such as organic farming and permacuture, although there may be some doubts as to whether or not that is achievable.

Even with oil, fertilisers and pesticides there will be a maximum population that this planet can support. We can not grow forever. Peak oil may just bring a population crash earlier than would otherwise be expected unless there is some immediate limitation on the population growth.


Ref: Limits to Growth : the 30-year update by onella Meadows, Jorgen Randers, Dennis Meadows. Earthscan. 2005. ISBN 1-84407-144-8.

==What is die-off?==

“Die off” is a rapid population collapse due to the decline in oil production and the lack of possible replacements that will meet our energy needs. Basically our whole civilisation can be considered to run on oil, from the production of pesticides and fertilisers to the transpiration of food and other goods everything is in one way or another depended on oil. This abundance of energy has allowed us to go into a population “overshoot”. An overshoot is where we have more people than we can really sustain. In other words, without oil our current population levels are unsustainable. It’s like borrowing more money form a loan shark than we can pay back; sooner or later it will catch up with us and the “pay back” isn’t going to be pleasant! As the oil production declines we may well be unable to supply food for most people on this planet which would lead to starvation and a population collapse.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dieoff.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wasn’t Malthus wrong?==

Yes and no. Basically his thesis was that the production capacity of the earth is far less than the potential for population growth. He considered that the food production increases at a liner rate and that the population increased exponentially. The result of which would mean that at some point in time there would be more people than we could supply food for if the population was not kept in check by such things as floods, war and diseases. This would lead to a “Malthusian catastrophe” where populations would collapse and society would revert to a subsistence level of existence.

Yes he was wrong in the sense that his predictions of population collapse did not come true, certainly not within the following centuries. However, he was right in the sense that population growth, if unchecked, will out strip our capacity to produce food. To some extent the reason why there was not a population collapse during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries could be considered to be because of the improvement in farming methods. One of the main improvements was, of course, the use of pesticides and artificial fertilisers that have been produced from oil. Therefore, if there was to be a decline in production of oil and /or an increase in the cost of oil there is a very real possibility of Malthus being proved correct in the twenty-first century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~stephan/malthus/malthus.0.html An Essay on the Principle of Population by Thomas Malthus. 1798.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Die-off sounds dramatic? Will it be?==
It depends what you mean by ”dramatic”. Its unlikely that if there is a population crash that it would happen overnight. The population could decline rapidly over a few years or even a few decades. Even so, on the long term scale of things a decline that took decade would still be seen as dramatic. It could also be seen as dramatic on the scale of the individuals who will go through any such population decline. An uncontrolled population collapse would entail a large amount of human suffering and hardship. To the people who would be there at the time that would be a very dramatic change in their lives!

==Can we stop die-off?==
Some would argue no. Essentially we have known that our current system is unsustainable for at least the last 70 years, possibly even longer. In the 1950 the decline in oil production was predicted to occur about the year 2000. The world was given a sharp remainder of the unsustainability of our current socio-economic system and the importance of oil by the Club of Rome and the oil shock in the 1970s. Even through we have known about the unsustainability of our current system we have done very little to correct the problem. Consequently we have just been running faster and faster to the cliff edge so that now it would take such a radical change to the way that we do things that society would just not be able to stop and change direction before we all fall off the cliff edge! So, no matter what we do now we would not be able to stop a population collapse, only minimise the suffering for our children and grand children who may have to go through it.

However, that may not be the case. It could be argued that die off is not inevitable. It could be the case that if we act now to point society in the direction of sustainability for a post carbon world we could avoid a population collapse. In one scenario of the Club of Rome, for example, a world population of eight thousand million, more than we have today, was sustainable.

There have been efforts by individuals and groups to form sustainable communities and these may be indicators of how we may live in the future. There have been advances in science that may help us produce the food we need without oil, for example, applied ecology in the form of permaculture. Combine that with a society that implements a zero population growth policy then there is every possibility, even at this later stage, of avoiding die off. However, the longer we leave it the harder it will be! The correct answer depends on what we do today!

== Does peak oil increase the chances of Nuclear War?==
Yes. Due to increased international tension and possibly limited resources for fighting wars, combined with increasing nuclear proliferation, the risk of Nuclear War is certainly increased.

==Since the industrialised world is so much more dependent on oil than the developing world, will the industrialised world suffer first?==

The oil crisis has begun for many poorer or developing countries where oil is now simply too expensive to use as they did before. These countries will be like 'canaries in the mine shaft'. Equally, people within countries will be affected differently, depending on their level of wealth. It will be like a rising tide.

==Is this oil crash going to be slow and gradual or hard and fast?==
It could be either and we need to be prepared for both.

==Why isn’t anyone dealing with this? Why isn’t it a number 1 national issue?==
A very good question! There actually people dealing with this but its is more on an individual or group bases rather than at local or national government level. What response there is from governments can be considered to be minimal and more in the form of words than action. The lack of any major response from the government can be seen as puzzling and there maybe a number of reasons for it.

It maybe that governments do not take the potential fall in oil production seriously, which could be because they are not convinced about peak oil or because it is not seen as a subject that will attract large number of votes. It could also be argued that the government’s job is to maintain the status quo and provide and environment that is profitable for business, stable and of a high standard of living for its citizens. As any attempt to move to a post peak, sustainable society would be counter to that objective governments are reluctant to implement any policies until dwindling oil supplies becomes a more serious threat to the economy. It could also be argued that peak oil and its effects are a long-term issue and that governments, businesses as well as individuals plan and act for the short term. As a result the lack of action may be a “we will cross that bridge when we come to it” attitude. Also, it can be considered that governments are there to serve the people and that the elected representatives are there to represent the opinions and interests of their constituents. As a result the government follows the people rather than leads from the front. So if the people are not interested nor wish to act then governments will follow suit. After all, governments get elected by promising a bright and sunny future and manipulating peoples opinions rather than campaigning on issues that deal with physical reality. Those parties that do deal with physical issues tend not to gain much voter support.

It could also be the case that the lack of government action is only a perception and that the government is doing something about it but it is not made public.

==Can’t I just buy a farm and be all right?==
Probably not!

Farming is currently only marginally profitable in the UK and across Europe. This would be insufficient to fund significant borrowings. If you have access to the funds to purchase a farm then it becomes a much more secure proposition. With shortages of food created by the peak in oil, farming is likely to become profitable once again.

Agriculture is currently heavily supported; will governments be able to continue this after oil has peaked? It is probably likely that they will have to, as food security will become once again the biggest issue which governments have to tackle.

Farmers have become very good at adapting to changing priorities. The Common Agricultural Policy and other government interventions frequently changes the direction in which farmers businesses need to go for the best profits. peak oil will alter the rules again, but will farmers respond, will they realise before it is too late that the change in the rules is permanent. Some will survive and prosper under the new rules others will go to the wall.

The average age for UK farmers is currently 60 which suggest that there will be a lot of people retiring from the industry over the next 10 to 15 years. Many currently have no sons or daughters wishing to enter the business, so there may be a glut of land on the market which may exert a downward pressure on the value of land.

Owning a farm does not guarantee that you will be able to sell whatever you produce. Farmers tend to have a broad range of skills, such as production, finance, marketing, mending, driving tractors.

If your primary concern is just to secure your own and your families food supply then buying a smallholding might be a good idea. However you would need to bear in mind whether you have or can obtain the skills of a smallholder and whether you are prepared to put up with the downsides, such as having to go outdoors every day whatever the weather.

You could just get an allotment and be in a good position from the point of view of your own food, however you may need to be prepared to defend and secure your crops if law &amp; order breaks down.

Farms nearest to centres of population, with easily accessed markets and shops will be best positioned to profit from the coming turmoil.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What are our options for dealing with peak oil?==
Once we accept that oil production cannot continue to grow, we are faced with the choice of how to proceed. The easiest option is to do nothing, carry on as we are and hope that a new technology will provide a solution or that the problem will not be a big as predicted. If we are to act there are a number of options open to us but we must decide whose interests we are acting in.

Firstly, we could just act in our own selfish interests and then we can ask do we move to a farm in the countryside, stock up on provisions and the weapons to protect them and so attempt to save ourselves and our family? This is our first option and can be summarised as “The bunker mentality”.

Alternatively we can think of the nation as a whole and about trying to preserve what we have. Then we can ask do we act as a nation, using our present wealth to secure the resources we will need it the future? Or do we choose the most difficult path, and attempt to scale-down our resource use responsibly, and thereby benefit the entire planet? That gives us our second option of heading towards a more sustainable society.

We could even take the interests of the plant a bit further and ask do we choose to change our social and economic structure so that we have a system that is in balance with nature. Perhaps this option is the most radical but could be argued to be the one that will enable us to have a good standard of living in a post peak world.

==Why is it important to act now? If we act now, we may damage the economy.==
Of course any action we take now will affect the economy, likely for the worse. But this affect must be weighed against the economic effects of the peak itself.

Whichever actions we choose to take, we must act soon. Even the big petroleum companies are predicting a global peak in oil production by 2020, while most independent geologist place it much sooner. We have no why of knowing when the wider effects of the peak will become evident in society, but once they become prominent, we will have missed our chance to prevent them.

==Can we afford to be wrong about peak oil?==
Any adequate preparation for peak oil will be difficult. On a national level, it will require strict regulatory measures to gradually lower our dependence on oil and gas, reducing our economy and rendering us less competitive globally. Personal sacrifices would also be necessary as car and plane travel was restricted and electricity use cutback. If the predictions are wrong and peak oil does not occur, these sacrifices will have been unnecessary.

But the consequences of wrongly assuming peak oil is &quot;no big deal&quot; are just as costly: once we've passed the peak, it is those countries which prepared beforehand which will be the best-off economically. If are economy is still reliant on today's levels of oil and gas consumption when global production begins to decline, we'll be forced to either pay exorbitant prices for whatever oil is available or face the economic blow of losing the oil and gas we depend on almost overnight.

Either way, we cannot afford to be wrong about peak oil.

==What is the government doing about this?==
Far too little. While Sweden is planning to have a 'oil-free' society by 2020, the UK finds it hard enough to begin to put plans into place to mitigate climate change. It may simply be a case of the government's faith in the markets to sort it out, through demand destruction - i.e. job loss, decreasing power usage. Some say that the government is dealing with peak oil through climate change. However, the government won't even really recognise the problem so officially it is not doing anything about it. There is a small but growing number of MPs concerned about it though.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/5992/a/51058&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=2200&amp;date=20051002&lt;/ref&gt;

==What can businesses do about this?==
Businesses provide products and services to consumers with a view to usually making a profit. Whatever business you look at it takes a resource from one source or another and adds value to it some way before moving it on to customers who are the prepared to pay for it.

There will be winners and losers in business. Many businesses will go to the wall not realising that the rules have changed permanently. Others will survive, and others will positively thrive. There will be new businesses that our generation had not previously dreamed of and old established businesses and industries which currently appear to be exceedingly strong will disappear completely. Broadly those that produce or sell necessities for their local communities will thrive and prosper. Businesses that produce or sell luxury items will suffer and probably go out of business altogether.

The general economic trends that we are likely to be looking at are high interest rates, periods of high inflation and periods of low inflation. It is also likely that some things will become un-saleable at any price, so provoking deflation in some areas whilst other items are going up in value. Different parts of the economy will be affected differently. Wages will probably not rise as quickly as the cost of living, and this will lead to unrest in the workforce and a growing number of strikes.

Rising energy costs are currently very much on businesses minds already. Businesses are going to have to accept that higher prices are here to stay and the costs will get even higher. Businesses will have to look at every way possible to reduce their energy costs. The methods for doing this will be via conservation of energy. Hedging against rising energy costs would be beneficial and this could involve signing long term contracts with suppliers or buying energy futures (this will probably be beyond most businesses).

Investing in &amp; controlling renewable sources of energy is another option as if you can generate enough power for your business, you are fixing the price for the long term. The problem with most forms of renewables available to businesses will be their intermittency and businesses need a reliable supply. There is of course some doubt as to whether the grid will be able to provide reliability in the future and this should be factored into business plans.

Some businesses will be tempted to ask the question “can I handle the rising costs of energy in my business?” And answer yes, but without taking into account what is going to happen to their suppliers and their customers and how it will affect their behaviour, the answers given will not necessarily be the right ones.

Customers are going to be spending an increasing proportion of their income on necessities such as fuel and food; this will change what they are able to buy. Customers that are reliant on their cars to get to a business will change where they buy things. They will do other things for entertainment; they may have less time to be entertained.

Businesses may have to find alternative routes to market as their existing distribution systems become to expensive.

Suppliers are businesses in their own right. Suppliers are critical to any business, whether it be raw materials or energy suppliers or computers. If suppliers cannot keep pace with change they may not be around to supply what businesses need for their processes. Security of supply could become a major business issue.

Businesses will need to look at what is happening to their competitors. It is possible that some will be in a better position to cope with the changes than others.

A key question that business should be asking is “can my business survive the coming changes”?

Many businesses will be able to, providing they are in the right business to start with and can manage themselves according to the new rules. They may have to change what they sell, how it is made, where it is made and many other things. It will be essential to plan the business with peak oil in mind.

If businesses can meet this challenge it will be easier for everyone. If businesses fail in a big way it will spell disaster for society as a whole as businesses are currently part of the fundamental fabric of society, and have been since long before the industrial revolution.

Survival will need to be the primary aim for businesses in the future.

==What are Tradable Energy Quotas?==
It modern society, how much energy an individual or business has access to is limited only by how much they can afford. The most fundamental difference as we pass the peak is that there will be a definite limit on the total amount of energy available—and more importantly there won't be enough for people to use as much as they might be able to purchase. With our present system, this would lead to such a huge increase in energy price that most people would no longer be able to afford any electricity or petrol at all.

One scheme for how we might prevent this involves what are called [http://www.teqs.net/ Tradable Energy Quotas (or TEQs)]. The key idea is that every individual and business would be awarded a certain energy &quot;quota&quot; once a month. The quota isn't the energy itself—it must still be purchased normally—but merely an allowance to consume that energy. So each time you fill-up at the pump or pay an electric bill, you'd spend some cash and use up some of your quota.

These energy quotas are called &quot;tradable&quot; because they'd be exactly that. If you didn't require all of your energy quota, you would be able to sell as much as you like to anyone else. Business which require a large amount of energy would need to purchase the addition consumption quotas from people or other businesses which use less.

The advantage of TEQ is that the price of petrol and electricy can be control, as the total amount of quotas awardment would be set to match the amount of energy available. And even if the price of the traded quotas were to escalate due to limited energy supply, this would only affect people and business who consume so much energy that their monthly allotment is insufficient; the majority of people would be able to live without purchasing any extra.

==What is the Rimini Protocol?==
Similar to the Kyoto Protocol for carbon emissions, the Rimini Protocol lays out a system whereby nations can mutually agree to reduce their oil and gas consumption. It was proposed by Dr. Colin Campbell and the Association for the Study of peak oil &amp; Gas, and signatories must agree to restrict their imports and consumption of oil. Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, the Rimini Protocol is in the very initial stages of refinement and has yet to get widespread attention of governments or the media.

==What is the Simultaneous Policy?==
The Simulataneous Policy is a way of getting governments around the world to implement hard choices all at the same time. Many governments won't implement a policy because it will harm them if they do it unilaterally but it everyone agreed to do it at the same time, then they would be okay. It is a way for governments to cooperate in solving global problems.

==What should government be doing about this?==
There are many different things that the Government could do to ease the transition to a post-peak world. To begin with, it needs to recognise the scale of the problem. At present, the Government denies that peak oil is imminent, because it relies on information provided by the flawed studies conducted by the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Once the Government acknowledges the problem, it should begin a process of educating the public as quickly as possible. This would include information about the possible ramifications for the UK and for the rest of the world, and the steps we need to take as a society to minimise the pain. The public must become much more aware of the energy they use, and how they can reduce their overall consumption.

Beyond this, the Government could produce a roadmap explaining how they intend to manage the energy descent, and a set of policy measures for implementing it. These might include:

*Introducing a fixed carbon allowance for each adult, which can be traded between individuals.
*Beginning the process of decentralising power generation, e.g. by funding local grids and micro-generation.
*Legislating very high energy efficiency requirements for new housing, consumer goods, electric lighting.
*Establishing local food production centres, and discourage shipments of food across the country and imports from abroad.
*Declaring a date by which most of the UK's energy will be independent of fossil fuels.

==Do we have to change our expectations?==
Yes. Things can't continue as they are and we need to have a bit rethink about what we want from the world.

==What is the optimum population levels for UK and the World?==
That depends on what we want to do as a society. If we try and maintain our current way of doing things then it can be argued that we have already exceeded our optimal population level and we could be heading for a population crash this century. If we were to head towards a more sustainable society, one that is in balance with nature but still a technological society we could still maintain our current levels of population and even have a higher level of population. The Club of Rome, for example, has a world-wide sustainable population level of 8 thousand million people in one of their scenarios.

Although it may be difficult to say what the optimal populatio0n level it would seam wise that we should be heading for a stable population level and zero population growth now. That way we have the possibility of avoiding the worst of any possible population crash or even avoiding it all together.&lt;ref&gt;''Limits to Growth : the 30-year update by Onella Meadows, Jorgen Randers, Dennis Meadows''. Earthscan. 2005. ISBN 1-84407-144-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Can we change the economic system?==
Yes we can. Not only can we but it can be argued that we must or a change will be forced upon us by nature. There are plans for other types of economic systems that have been around for many decades or more. There is, for example, well know systems such as socialism and communism. However, those system have had mixed success. The communist system in the former Soviet Union collapsed and even in communist China elements of a free market has been introduced suggesting that the centralised-planed economy does not work. However, it can be argued that the socialism practised in Sweden in the 1970s and 1980s is an example of a socialist system that did work. However, such systems also suffer form having a sigma attached to them in the West.

There are also other plans for money-less system. These systems such as energy credits of the Technocracy movement in the US and Europe or the cosmic accounting system proposed by Buckminster Fuller use energy as a regulator of the production system (like for example, the money-less society of “Star Trek”). The problem with these systems is they have not been fully evaluated in experimentation or simulation and need more research before we can be sure they can work.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cjfearnley.com/fuller-faq-3.html#ss3.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.technocracy.ca/pdfs/Brief29.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==A lot of this sounds like things the green movement has been saying.==
And others as well. You may well find similarities between the Greens and other organisations who take a more “reality based” view of things. You could say that the greens work from the environment and its physicals limits and then sees how people can bets fit into that. Other parties and organisation are more money centric and the “value of money” is subjective, therefore, it could be argued that such policies, ideologies or plans are based on subjective judgements rather than physical reality.

Nature does not care what race, region or ideology you may have. Nature has her own rules, you either play by her rules or you take what comes!

==Can’t we survive without oil?==
We have managed to survive with out before and in all likelihood we will managed to survive with out oil in the future. That is we as in the human race, now if “we” was to mean this civilisation then it will probably not survive, certainly not in its current form without oil. However, this society is not the only way we can have a high standard of living not is it the only way we can maintain a technological society. Surviving is one option but we can actually go beyond just surviving and work towards something worth while.

==Do we need to change the definition of success?==
Yes. If we continue with success being defined by increasing economic wealth, then with this clearly not being possible, will only lead to greater unhappiness. It may be that we want to start thinking about social success - i.e. Gross National Happiness rather than Gross Domestic Product.

== Do we need to have an end-game plan?==
No, there is nothing that says we must have a plan at all. It could be argued that there was no plan for forming this current civilisation in the first place. It could be argued that this civilisation was formed because of individuals and groups following rules (such as law of the state) and interacting with one another rather than following any sort of plan. However, where would we be if we had followed a plan? What could we achieve if we had worked towards a goal? Perhaps we would not be in this situation of facing the possibility of lives ruined and populations crashing? Perhaps if we worked towards a goal and had a plan maybe we could actually build a better society post peak than we built pre-peak?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==This sounds bad, but why should I worry about it?==
Isn’t it your world? Your friends? Your family? Your children? Your grandchildren? Isn’t it in some way going to effect you? Your standard of living? You don’t want to worry about that? Well, maybe you shouldn’t worry about it, worry does not get you anywhere. Worry does not help. Besides, it’s not all bad. OK, oil will one day be too expensive to use. One day we will be living in a post carbon world, but that world is not necessarily a dystropia. It is not by all means certain that we will end up living in a “Mad Max” nightmare. Think of peak oil from a more positive side. Think of a world that is more locally organised, one that is in balance with nature. We can still have technology base society. One with a good standard of living. Peak oil gives us an opportunity. One where we can start to think about what kind of world we want for our children and our grand children. One we can start building. It is not beyond our abilities to do and the earlier we start the easier it will be. Don’t worry, act!

==How am I supposed to prepare for this when I have so much else to deal with?==
Lack of time for you own survival? Lack of time for your own future? One might wonder about priorities! However, preparing for peak oil and a post carbon world is probably not something that you should be doing by yourself. If at all possible then you should be working with others. Family or those living close to you for example. Sharing the work is one way of giving yourself more time.

==If I start giving stuff up, it’ll just make things cheaper for others and they’ll be able to enjoy it instead. Why should I give things up?==
Greed and selfishness will always be with us and it is the nature of cooperation that when the majority benefit there will always be more to gain in the short term by acting selfishly. However, in the long term all will lose. Hopefully, most people will realise that their long term best option is to work together with others. To reduce, reuse and recycle so even though some people will gain by acting selfish most people will still gain overall. Greed and selflessness are part of human nature and they will never go away. But so is generosity, a cooperative sprit and a willingness to do things for others. Those characteristics will, most like, be the characteristics that will see us though and hopefully enough people will realise that so that we can benefit from working together, despite the minority that will be working against everyone else for their own selfish reasons.

==Do I have to go and live in a cave or in a forest?==
Most likely, no. It will be very unlikely that that will be the sate we will end up in. The human race has spent most of its existence with out oil. Civilisations have come and civilisations have gone but even when things have been at their lowest people have survived with out haven’t to go back to caves or the forest. It is quite clear that we can not continue as we are but that does not mean things will go backwards. Already there are people working on local solutions to a post carbon world, people are forming communities and looking at growing their own food. You could see those as seeds of a future society. Perhaps one that is more in balance with nature? They can be seen as a sign that people will not have to go back to caves but there is a way to live post carbon with a good standard of living.

==Should I get a gun or learn self-defence?==
Learning self-defence is a wise thing to do regardless of peak oil and there are many good self-defence systems such as ju-jitsu that a person can learn. As for a gun, it is not clear what the situation will be like post peak but it is probably unlikely to deteriorate to that degree. On one hand, as time and finances are limited it would be wise to allocate such resources to more important activities such helping with local solutions. However, on the other hand a gun could be an option if you wish to plan for the worse case scenario. It can also be seen as an unwise activity as more and more people obtain guns it becomes more of a necessity to have one, which then contributes to a deteriorating situation. Not opting for a gun could help keep the situation at a more civilised level.

One compromise position is to obtain a gun for hunting rather than self-defence which can also be used on a farm for activities such as shooting vermin. The gun could then be available if things do go really bad.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bsdgb.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

==Will people wake up in time?==
On the basis of the past we predict the future. Everything was fine yesterday and it is fine today so it will be fine tomorrow. Won’t it? There has been plenty of doomsayer in the past predicting the end of the world and they were all wrong so anyone today predicting bad time ahead will also be wrong. Won’t they? People like to think things are going well. They don’t want to know about problems. They vote for politicians that promise them a better future. Even if there are problems, we will cross that bridge when we come to it. So even if you have all the facts in the world stacked in your favour. Even if the evidence supports your case people won’t listen. They are too busy with their own lives to think about something that is depressing. Not until thing start to hurt will people wake up and then they will want to know why was anything done sooner?

Even so, there are people who wake up early. There are people who listen and there are people who act. A world with out oil is not all doom and glom. Peak oil gives us an opportunity to think about what we are doing and what kind of world we want to live in and people are being to wake up to that. The question should really be are enough people waking up or is apathy going to bring about our doom?

==Where should I live?==
Where you live is, of course, up to you. But factors you might like to consider when deciding where to live are things like:

'''Distance to work''' – with ever increasing oil prices the car might become too expensive to use on a daily bases. You might like to move closer to work or somewhere where you could telecommute.

'''Growing space''' – food prices might also go up. It might be economical, or even necessary, to grow your own food. That could mean you might want a house with a garden or a place near an allotment.

'''Other people''' – some people are already acting. You might want to consider moving to where there are already people preparing for a post carbon world.

==Should I have children?==
This is essentially and hopefully will remain a personal choice. If you don’t care about the future of the human race then you probably wouldn’t be interested in the consequences of peak oil and are best to go out and party. If you do care, then at the societal level sensible reproduction is not only not at odds with mitigating the worst consequences of peak oil, but is essential for the future of the human race. In fact just a small drop in the overall birthrate, i.e. sensible reproduction, would reduce our population naturally over a reasonably short period. Reducing our population is seen by many as important in order to share out the reduced resources and pull ourselves back from overshoot (please see The Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update (Meadows, Randers, Meadows ISBN 193149858X June 2004 for more info). However stopping all reproduction would lead to self imposed die-off , which unless all you are interested in is a human free world for all the fluffy bunnies is not the solution.

In short, have children if you like, but not too many.

==How should I change my life?==
The keywords here are: reduce, reuse and recycle. Something you could do is to try and look at what you use and see if you could reduce you consumption and your eco-foot print. Look at what waste you produce, look at insulating you home or look at just turning down the heating a bit. When you go shopping plan your waste in the shop and think about what goods you buy. Then look at reusing things. If you reuse something it will save you having to buy it again and saves having to throw it away. Many things can be reused such as margarine tubs which can be used for storage, so can glass bottles and jars. Clothes can be passed on to other kids etc. Recycle what you can't reuse. It only takes a small amount of additional effort to throw waste away in a container marked “glass” or “paper” rather than all in one bin. Then those, already sorted, containers can be taken to the local recycling station.

Another thing that you might want to consider is where you buy your goods from. Local produced goods have less of an impact on the environment than goods produced halfway across the world and are then transported to you local shop. The same can be said for buying things that are organic. If you can buy locally, think about doing so (even if it's a little bit more expensive). See if there is a local farmers' market or box scheme in your local area. Support your local shop and even see if you can work in cooperation with your local shop.

==If I tell people about this, will they take me seriously?==
Probably not. After all, why should they? Everything is fine isn’t it? Besides, if things were to go wrong then the government would fix it, wont they? And what do you know about it anyway? If there was a real problem won’t the experts be telling us? We don’t need to hear it from doomsayers such as you! Now, I will go stick my head back in the sand!

However, that is not a good reason not to inform other people. You can never change people’s minds, they will do that to themselves. You can’t tell other people what to think but you can inform yourself and then inform others. It is then up to them what they do with the information and most people probably wont take it seriously until things start to hurt them personally. However, sooner or later you will find someone who will take it seriously and then another and then another. There are already a small groups of people becoming informed and informing others who are taking it seriously. Hopefully the number will continue to grow by small actions of individuals who inform others despite most people they meet not taking it seriously.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Can we adapt? Can we survive?==
Yes we can, and that is yes to both questions. We have done so in the past and we, no doubt will be able to do so in the future. It may not be easy and it may not be a pleasant experience but we can adapt and we can survive. Lets take the worse case scenario and say that there is a decline in world oil production and that lead to a Total Economic Collapse (TEC). What then? Would that mean that the human race will be extinct? That we would fail to survive? The human race is intelligent and, although we may not behave rationally all the time, we can analyse and solve problems when we put our minds to it. We may be short sighted and only think of our short-term selfish goals but there are other aspects of human nature. We may live in a socio-economic system that encourages selfishness and greed, but people are also capable of cooperation and self-sacrifice. It is well within our potential to rebuild and adapt to a drastic change in the way we live. People are already doing it. Individuals are working on their own personnel solutions. Groups have been formed to work together for a post carbon world. There is every possibility that we could be seeing the beginnings of a new socio-economic system. One that moves away from placing importance on material wealth, and is instead in balance with nature, focused on securing our long-term interests.

Maybe in the near future, immediately post peak, there will be suffering due to our lack of foresight and willingness to face up to the challenges that face us but beyond that there is room for great hope. We can actually build a better future but its up to us. The future is built on what we do today. What kind of future do we want for our children and grand children? Let's start building a better future today!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is The Association for the Study of peak oil &amp; Gas?==
ASPO is a network of scientists, affiliated with European institutions and universities, having an interest in determining the date and impact of the peak and decline of the world's production of oil and gas, due to resource constraints.

Its mission is to:
#Define and evaluate the world's endowment of oil and gas;
#Model depletion, taking due account of demand, economics, technology and politics;
#Raise awareness of the serious consequences for Mankind.

ASPO presently has 26 branches around the world.

==What is EROEI?==
EROEI, or Energy Returned on Energy Invested, is the proportion of energy produced by a resource (such as oil, gas or wind power), relative to the energy required to exploit that resource. It is sometimes referred to as the net energy return.

EROEI provides a simple numeric value for measuring how economical it is to produce a particular fuel source. An EROEI of 1 means that the energy produced by the resource is the same as the energy used in its production. As EROEI increases, progressively more energy can be produced as a proportion to the energy input.

The energy used to exploit a resource is largely dependent on its accessibility and can be highly variable over time. Prospecting, mining, fuel transportation, infrastructure, waste disposal and decommissioning are factors that may affect EROEI calculations.

In the early days of oil exploration production costs were low, because oil was discovered in shallow basins that did not require the drilling of deep wells. This meant that the EROEI was often more than 50. EROEI has steadily decreased since that time, and will eventually reach the point where it is no longer economical to extract it, at least for use as simple energy.

A 1984 study found that nuclear energy from light-water reactors had an EROEI of about 4&lt;ref&gt;''Energy and the U.S. Economy: A Biophysical Perspective''. Cutler J. Cleveland; Robert Costanza; Charles A. S. Hall; Robert Kaufmann. Science, New Series, Vol. 225, No. 4665 (Aug. 31, 1984), 890-897.&lt;/ref&gt;. By comparison, the Danish Wind Energy Association claims that during its life time a wind turbine delivers 80 times more energy than is used in its production, maintenance and scrapping&lt;ref&gt;http://www.windpower.org/en/didyouknow.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

Note: EROEI is occasionally quoted as the difference between the energy returned and the energy invested, rather than the ratio of these two figures. In this case, negative EROEI values correspond to a net loss of energy and positive values correspond to a net gain&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ker.co.nz/pdf/Energy%20and%20the%20U.S.%20Economy-%20A%20Biophysical%20Perspective.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

==What are the laws of thermodynamics?==
Thermodynamics is a branch of science that studies heat and its movement through systems. Heat is energy on the move so it’s an important area of study for anything that involves energy. Thermodynamics can be summed up in three laws.

The first law basically says that the increase in the amount of energy in a system is the same as the energy added to the system plus the losses. As no system is perfect you will lose some energy when you add energy to a system so you will need to add a bit more to cover the losses. Another way of saying that is to say the energy is conserved.

The second law says that you can’t get energy from nothing. So if you take the energy output from a system and feed it into a system the system will run down and come to a stop. This is because what you take out is a bit less than what you put in because the system is not perfect and you lose some energy in the system.

The third law states that as the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero (-273°C), the available energy of that system approaches zero.

==What is entropy?==
Entropy is a term used to describe the energy in a system which is not available to use. If we take the example of a wind-turbine, the turning propellers generate rotational kinetic energy—which is use to power a generator and produce electricity—but they also generate heat due to friction. This heat energy cannot be used, and is therefore included in the entropy of the windmill.

The second law of thermodynamics (above) is a result of this kind of entropy. It says that in any process, a certain amount of usable energy must be converted to entropy and lost. If the system is to continue to function for a indefinite period of time, sources of fresh energy must be found to make up for that lost due to entropy.

==What is emergy?==

Emergy is a contraction of the term embedded energy. &quot;It evaluates the work previously done to make a product or service. Emergy is a measure of energy used in the past and thus is different from a measure of energy now.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mnforsustain.org/emergy_odum_howard_t_emergy_evaluation.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

It brings into account the true energy and environmental cost of a product or process. It is very useful for, among other things, evaluating alternatives to primary energy sources. For example, when assessing a solar power, you don’t just look at how much energy it produces and how much it cost, you look at the total amount of energy used in the process of constructing and installing that solar panel, and also the environmental impacts which are often not included.

==What is fractional reserve banking?==
&quot;Fractional-reserve banking is the near-universal practice of banks retaining only a fraction of their clients' deposits and notes as reserves to satisfy demands for withdrawals, investing the remainder in loans to generate income. Clients would normally receive a proportion of this income via interest on their deposit. Inflation, partly caused by fractional-reserve banking increasing money supply, would reduce a client's capital growth in real terms.&quot; This creates the risk of a 'bank run' when demand depositors and note holders attempt to collectively withdraw more money than the bank has in reserves, causing the bank to collapse.&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Fractional_reserve_banking|&quot;Fractional reserve banking&quot; on ''Wikipedia'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is important to understand because during the first half of the age of oil banks created money by lending more money than they had on deposit due to confidence that tomorrow’s expansion would pay for today’s debt. Because oil is the principal driver of economic growth, the decline of oil undermines that belief. This in turn erodes the value of most organizations quotes on the stock market.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energybulletin.net/5944.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence is emerging that progress can no longer be taken for granted.  Growth may be coming to an end. Since our entire financial order — interest rates, pension funds, insurance, stock markets — is predicated on growth, the social and economic consequences would be severe and widespread.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2099-1813695_1,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Will banks be so willing to lend money without the confidence they will be repaid? Will interest rates shoot up causing people to default on their loans and mortgages, increasing the problem?

==What is permaculture?==
In essence permaculture is using modern know how along with nature to introduce design into growing and as such achieve sustainable high-yielding ecosystems. The name comes from permanent agriculture.

Permaculture therefore seeks to reduce the overall impact on the environment and not externalise costs. Concepts include the forest garden, renewable energies, natural building materials and energy efficient design, companion planting, diversity of ecosystems, natural fertilizers and natural pest control methods.

The permaculture movement has long been behind reducing dependencies on fossil fuels both because of their environmental impact as well as their lack of sustainability.

A Hybrid Hierarchical Clustering is a clustering technique that try to combine the best characteristics of both Hierarchical Techniques (Agglomerative and Divisive).


== Introduction ==

Clustering can be considered an important unsupervised learning problem, which tries to find similar structures within an unlabeled data collection (JAIN, MURTY, FLYNN, 1999) &lt;ref name=jain99&gt; Jain, A. K., Murty, M. N., Flynn, P. J. (1999) &quot;Data Clustering: A Review&quot;. ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 31(3), p.264-323, 1999. &lt;/ref&gt;.

These similar structures are data groups, better known as clusters. The data inside each cluster is similar (or close) to elements within his cluster, and is dissimilar (or further) to elements that belongs to other clusters. The clustering techniques' goal is to determinate the intrinsic grouping in a data set (JAIN, MURTY, FLYNN, 1999) &lt;ref name=&quot;jain99&quot; /&gt;.

== Clustering Techniques ==

There are several clustering techniques but none can be considered the absolute best method. Each technique has his own merits and flaws, which usually leave the job to the user to determine what clustering method, will better satisfy his needs.

== Hierarchical Clustering ==

The hierarchical clustering functions basically in joining closest clusters until the desired number of clusters is achieved. This kind of hierarchical clustering is named agglomerative because it joins the clusters iteratively. There is also a divisive hierarchical clustering that does a reverse process, every data item begin in the same cluster and then it is divided in smaller groups (JAIN, MURTY, FLYNN, 1999)&lt;ref name=&quot;jain99&quot; /&gt;.

The distance measurement between clusters can be done in several ways, and that's how hierarchical clustering algorithms of single, average and complete differ.

In the single-link clustering, also known as minimum method, the distance between two clusters is considered to be the minimum distance between all pairs of data items.
In the complete link clustering, also known as maximum method, the distance between two clusters is considered to be the maximum distance between all pairs of data items. The clusters found by the complete link algorithm are usually more compact than the ones found by the single link. However, the single link algorithm is more versatile (JAIN, MURTY, FLYNN, 1999)&lt;ref name=&quot;jain99&quot; /&gt;.

In the average link clustering, the distance between two clusters is equal to the average distance between all data. A variation of this method uses median distance, which is less sensitive to greater data variation than the average distance.

Many hierarchical clustering algorithms have an appealing property that the nested sequence of clusters can be graphically represented with a tree, called a 'dendrogram' (CHIPMAN, TIBSHIRANI, 2006)&lt;ref name=chipman06&gt;Chipman, H., Tibshirani, R. (2006) &quot;Hybrid hierarchical clustering with applications to microarray data&quot;. Biostatistics Advance Access, 7(2), p.286-301, apr 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;. Figure 1 shows an dendogram example.

The greatest disadvantage of the hierarchical clustering is his high complexity order of O(n^2 log n) (JAIN, MURTY, FLYNN, 1999)&lt;ref name=&quot;jain99&quot; /&gt;. The Hierarchical approach however has the advantage of handling clusters with different densities, much better than other clustering techniques.

== Hybrid Hierarchical Clustering ==

Agglomerative algorithms group data into many small clusters and few large ones, which usually makes them good at identifying small clusters but not large ones. Divisive algorithms however, have reserved characteristics; making them good at identifying large clusters in general (CHIPMAN, TIBSHIRANI, 2006)&lt;ref name=chipman06 /&gt;.

Hybrid Hierarchical Clustering Techniques try to combine the best advantages of both Agglomerative and Divisive techniques (LAAN, POLLARD, 2002; CHIPMAN, TIBSHIRANI, 2006)&lt;ref name=chipman06 /&gt;&lt;ref name=laan02&gt;Laan, M., Pollard, K. (2002) &quot;A new algorithm for hybrid hierarchical clustering with visualization and the bootstrap&quot;. Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference, 117 (2), p.275-303, dec 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;. The way this combination is implemented depends on the chosen algorithm.

In this section it will be presented a hybrid hierarchical algorithm that uses the concept of 'mutual cluster' to combine the divisive techniques procedures with information gained from a preliminary agglomerative clustering.

=== Mutual Cluster ===

A mutual cluster can be defined as a group of data that are collectively closer to each other than to any other data, and distant from all other data. The data contained in a mutual cluster should never be separated (CHIPMAN, TIBSHIRANI, 2006)&lt;ref name=chipman06 /&gt;.

Basically that requires in a mutual cluster that, the largest distance between data elements in S to be smaller than the smallest distance from an element in S to any data not in S:

&lt;math&gt; d(x,y)_{x \in S, y \notin S} &gt; diameter(S) \equiv \max_{w \in S, z \in S} d(w,z)&lt;/math&gt;

Where S is a subset of the data, d is a distance function between two data items, x is an element belonging to S, and y is an element that does not belong to S.

There is an interesting mutual cluster's property which indicates that a mutual cluster is not broken by an agglomerative clustering with any of single, average or complete linkage approaches (CHIPMAN, TIBSHIRANI, 2006)&lt;ref name=chipman06 /&gt;. For more information on single, average or complete linkage approaches, see the agglomerative techniques in the hierarchical clustering section.

This property has several implications on mutual clusters. The most obvious is to support the idea that mutual clusters contain strong clustering information, no matter which linkage approach is used. This property also aids in the interpretation of agglomerative methods. This additional information can aid in the interpretation of mutual clusters, or in the decision of what clusters to divide.

Another implication of this property would be that mutual clusters can't be broken by agglomerative methods, which indicates that all mutual clusters can be identified by examining nested clusters in this method.

== Algorithm ==

The hybrid hierarchical algorithm using mutual clusters can be described in three steps:

# Compute the mutual clusters using an agglomerative technique.
# Perform a constrained divisive technique in which each mutual cluster must stay intact. This is accomplished by temporarily replacing a mutual cluster of data elements by their centroid.
# Once the divisive clustering is complete, divide each mutual cluster by performing another divisive clustering 'within' each mutual cluster.

The mutual cluster property and implications described earlier, indicates how it is possible to use agglomerative techniques to easily find mutual clusters in Step 1. For Step 2 any top-down method could be employed, it doesn't even need to be a divisive hierarchical algorithm. In Step 3, an agglomerative method can be used instead. Since mutual cluster are usually small, the use of either a top-down or bottom-up approach in Step 3 will give similar results. Using a top-down at both steps 2 and 3 just seems simpler.

'''Details:'''

The hybridHclust package uses the mutual cluster concept to construct a clustering in which mutual clusters are never broken. This is achieved by temporarily &quot;fusing&quot; together all points in a mutual cluster so that they have equal coordinates. The resultant top-down clusterings are then &quot;stitched&quot; together to form a single top-down clustering (CHIPMAN, TIBSHIRANI, 2006; 2008)&lt;ref name=chipman06 /&gt;&lt;ref name=chipman08&gt;Chipman, H., Tibshirani, R. (2008) &quot;Package hybridHClust&quot;, apr 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;.

&quot;Only maximal mutual clusters are constrained to not be broken. Thus if points A, B, C, D are a mutual cluster and points A, B are also a mutual cluster, only the four points will be forbidden from being broken&quot; (CHIPMAN, TIBSHIRANI, 2008)&lt;ref name=chipman08 /&gt;.

This package uses squared Euclidean distance between rows of x as a distance measurement. In some instances, a desirable distance measure is d(x1,x2)=1-cor(x1,x2), if x1 and x2 are 2 rows of the matrix x. This correlation-based distance is equivalent to squared Euclidean distance once rows have been scaled to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1. This can be accomplished by pre-processing the data matrix before calling the hybrid clustering algorithm (CHIPMAN, TIBSHIRANI, 2008)&lt;ref name=chipman08 /&gt;.

The main method to perform Hybrid clustering is called hybridHclust.

'''Usage'''&lt;br/&gt;
hybridHclust(x, themc=NULL, trace=FALSE)

'''Arguments'''&lt;br/&gt;
x - A data matrix whose rows are to be clustered&lt;br/&gt;
themc - An object representing the mutual clusters in x, typically generated by mutualCluster function. If it is not provided, it will be calculated.&lt;br/&gt;
trace – Indicates if internal steps be printed as they execute.

'''Return'''&lt;br/&gt;
A dendogram in hclust format

== Visualization ==

The hybridHClust function returns a dendogram representing the algorithm clusters. A dendogram can be seem using the 'plot' function.

The mutual clusters can be calculated using the mutual cluster function. The function has a 'plot' parameter that automatically plots the mutual clusters dendogram on a graph. To print the mutual clusters is necessary to use the 'print.mutualCluster' function.

Please remember to load the hybridHclust R package before trying any of the example codes.

=== Example ===

&lt;pre style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New', monospace&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
# Function to show multiple graphs plotting, in this case 3 graphs in one row 
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
# An Example Data 
x &lt;- cbind(c(-1.4806,1.5772,-0.9567,-0.92,-1.9976,-0.2723,-0.3153),c( -0.6283,-0.1065,0.428,-0.7777,-1.2939,-0.7796,0.012))
# Plot the example data
plot(x, pch = as.character(1:nrow(x)), asp = 1)
# Calculate the mutual clusters
mc1 &lt;- mutualCluster(x, plot=TRUE)
print.mutualCluster(mc1) # print the mutual clusters
dist(x) # distance between data so you can verify that mc's are correct
# Calculate the Hybrid Hierarchical Cluster
hyb1 &lt;- hybridHclust(x)
# Plot the Hybrid Clustering Dendogram
plot(hyb1)
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

== Case Study ==

To better illustrate the clustering technique, it will be shown a simple case study. 

The &quot;Big Five&quot;, in contemporary psychology, consists of five important personality factors. These five factors have been found to contain and subsume more-or-less all known personality traits within their five domains and to represent the basic structure behind all personality traits.

The Big Five factors and their constituent traits can be summarized as follows:
* Openness - appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety of experience.
* Conscientiousness - a tendency to show self-discipline, act dutifully, and aim for achievement; planned rather than spontaneous behavior.
* Extraversion - energy, positive emotions, urgency, and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others.
* Agreeableness - a tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others.
* Neuroticism - a tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, or vulnerability.

The most common way for a psychologist to measure these factors in someone’s personality, is to apply a 'test' with descriptive sentences. The test scores for these traits are frequently presented as percentile scores. 

=== Scenario/Situation/Development === 

Let's assume Big Five scores being applied to a population. In this case the test also comes with a socio-economic test for research purposes. The tests could be clustered in groups based on their percentile scores in each factor and the socio-economic variable, so that psychologists may better analyze the results and their possible effect on the population.

=== Input Data ===

The input data is a six dimensional numerical data consisting in the five factors percentile scores and the person’s family income. The input data was randomly generated using a normal distribution on each dimension. The random generated data saves time and avoid the legal issue in using a person’s possible privilege information (even anonymously).

The columns O, C, E, A, N represent respectively Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreableness and Neuroticism factors. The values on all of these columns are presented as percentile results from the Big Five test. The percentiles for each factor vary from a minimum of 5 up to a maximum of 95 in intervals of 5. 

The column I represent the person’s family income, the value is the number of minimum wages that family earn. 

A csv file with the input data can be found here: [http://rapidshare.com/files/321641297/hybridHclust_case_study_input.csv.html HybridHClust Case Study CSV Input File]

Figure 2: Hybrid clustering dendogram of the above case study data

=== Analysis ===

Because the case study has a multi-dimensional data it’s harder to visualize what the clusters have in common. However, when a good number of clusters are chosen, it is possible to see their similarities and better analyze the results.

Look at the cluster formed by 50, 59, 23, 94, 43, 82, 90, 5, 4, 42, 70, 72 and 37. The cluster has mid to high values of neuroticism [50, 95], mid to low values of openness [5, 50], and low to mid high values of conscientiousness [15, 65].

If the values range in a cluster was an indication of a risk behavior or pathology, the psychologist would be able to pay more attention to anyone in that group for example. Or with more accurate socio-economic variables it would be possible to see correlations between the big five factors and other socio-economic factors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Applying as a Freshman Student==
Many graduating high school students apply to UC San Diego each year but only some of them receive an acceptance letter. Getting into UCSD is difficult because of all the competition with other potential students.
 
==Applying as a Transfer Student==
Each year, UC San Diego accepts a certain number of transfer students from community colleges and other colleges and universities. This number is smaller than the number of freshmen admitted each year and is very  competitive. Most transfer students try to avoid being admitted to Revelle College and Eleanor Roosevelt College because IGETC certification does not cover all the general education (GE) requirements for those colleges. Transfer students who have completed the IGETC still need to fulfill certain Revelle and ERC specific GE requirements when they transfer to UCSD.[http://revelle.ucsd.edu/prosp-students/igetc-plus.html][http://roosevelt.ucsd.edu/academics/gen-ed/index.html]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Eleanor Roosevelt College (ERC)''' is the fifth undergraduate college created at UC San Diego. It is located at the northern end of the main campus and is near Thurgood Marshall College. This college has an international theme and the International House (&quot;I-House&quot;) is part of this college.[http://roosevelt.ucsd.edu/intl-house/index.html] The ERC campus is one of the newer areas of the campus so ERC students enjoy newer residence halls and other facilities than students living at older parts of the UCSD campus such as Revelle College and Muir College.

==Academics==
Roosevelt College has a six quarter sequence of courses known as the Making of the Modern World (MMW) that every freshman must take (transfer students must take three of them).[http://roosevelt.ucsd.edu/mmw/index.html]  This sequence consists primarily of world history, spanning prehistoric times up to the present. For each quarter of MMW, students must write a research paper on a certain theme relevant to what is taught in class. In the first few MMW courses, students learn to write a university-level academic paper and do so throughout the rest of the sequence. Attendance at discussion sections is required. A student's TA grades their paper so students can get valuable feedback from their TA at their discussion section.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Food from Other Sources ==


Bad and poisonous diet.—In reading the accounts of travellers who have suffered severely for want of food, a striking fact is common to all, i. e. that carrion and garbage of every kind can be eaten, under those circumstances, without the stomach rejecting it. And life can certainly be supported on a diet which would give severe illness to a man not driven to it by the pangs of hunger. There is, however, a great difference in the power that different people have of eating rank food without being made ill by it. It appears that no flesh, excepting that of some fish, is poisonous to man; but with vegetables it is very different. No certain rule can be given to distinguish wholesome plants from poisonous ones, but it has been observed that much the same things suit the digestion of a bird that suit those of a man, and therefore that a traveller, who otherwise would make trials at hap-hazard, ought to examine the contents of those birds' crops that he may catch or shoot, to give a clue to k;° &lt;&quot;rr&quot;vl'!ments. The rule has notable exceptions, but in ny other guide, it is a very useful one. rds are shot, they should be skinned, not :h of the rankness lies in their skin. The breast and wings are the least objectionable parts in them, and if there be abundance of food, these should alone be cooked.

If any meat that you may get, or if the water of any pool at which you encamp, is under suspicion of being poisoned, let one of your dogs drink before you do, and wait an hour to watch the effects of it upon him.

§ 2. Food from various sources.-—There are two nutritious plants, nettle and fern, that are found wild in very many countries ; and therefore the following extract from Messrs. Hue and Gabet's travels in Thibet may be of service:— &quot; When the young stems of ferns are gathered, quite tender, before they arc covered with down, and while the first leaves are bent and rolled up in themselves, you have only to boil them in pure water to realise a dish of delicious asparagus. We would also recommend the nettle, which, in our opinion, might be made an advantageous substitute for spinach; indeed, more than once we proved this by our own experience. The nettle should be gathered quite young, when the leaves are perfectly tender. The plant should be pulled up whole, with a portion of the root. In order to preserve your hands from the sharp biting liquid which issues from the &quot; points, you should wrap them in linen of close texture. When once the nettle is boiled, it is perfectly innocuous, and this vegetable, so rough in its exterior, becomes a very delicate dish. We were able to enjoy this delightful variety of esculents for more than a month. Then the little tubercles of the fern became hollow and horny, and the sterns themselves grew as hard as wood, while the nettle, armed with a long white beard, presented only a menacing and awful aspect.&quot;

Bones contain a great, deal of nourishment, which is got at

by boiling them, pounding their ends between two stones, and sucking them. There is a revolting account in French history, of a besieged garrison of Sancerre, in the time of Charles IX., and again subsequently at Paris, and it may be elsewhere, digging up the graveyards for bones as sustenance.

Honey, to find, when there are bees about.— Catch a bee, tie a feather or a straw to his leg, which can easily be done (natives thrust it up into his body), throw him into the air, and follow him as he flies slowly to his hive. The instinct of the honeybird is well known, which induces him to lead men to hives that he may share in the plunder. The stories that are told of the malice of the bird, in sometimes tricking a man and leading him to sleeping wild animals instead of the bee's nest, ai-e well authenticated.

All old hides or skins of any kind, that are not tanned, are fit and good for food; they improve all soup, by being mixed with it, or they may be toasted and hammered. Long boiling would make jelly of them. Many a hungry person has cooked and eaten his sandals or skin clothing.

Most kinds of creeping things are eatable, and used by the Chinese. Locusts and grasshoppers are not at all bad. To prepare them, pull off the legs and wings, and roast them with a little grease in an iron dish, like coffee. Hank seabirds, if caught, put in a coop, and fed with corn, were found by Captain Bligh to become fat and well-tasted.

=Introduction=

Plastic failure modes, even of simple structures, are usually difficult to analyze in a precise quantitative manner.  Sophisticated FEM algorithms and significant CPU-times are often necessary in order to produce realistic results.  

Limit analysis offers a different, simplistic approach.  It is based on a few assumptions and enables the analyst to achieve intrinsic lower and upper bound assessments of the catastrophic loads.

=Introduction=

All materials display an approximately linear response to moderate loads.  This is manifested in Hooke's law of linear-elastic materials, which in its simplest form can be written as

 &lt;math&gt;\sigma = E\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;     (1)

Where:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\sigma=&lt;/math&gt; the normal stress, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\sigma=&lt;/math&gt;&lt;i&gt;applied force / area of load carrying cross section&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;E=&lt;/math&gt; the elastic modulus (or Young's modulus)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\epsilon=&lt;/math&gt; the normal tension, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\epsilon=&lt;/math&gt;&lt;i&gt;difference in length due to loading / length of non-loaded specimen&lt;/i&gt;

The figure below illustrates the stress-strain curve of some material.  Hooke's law is valid in the interval marked &quot;Elastic region&quot;.

[[File:Stress-strain1.svg|thumb|center|300px|Generic stress-strain graph for a ductile material.]]

=Tensile Testing=


Young's modulus can be measured by tensile testing of specimens such as the one in the picture below.  

[[File:Traction sample.png|thumb|center|300px|Tensile testing.]]

The basic idea of the test is to measure the length &lt;math&gt;l_0&lt;/math&gt; at rest, the response &lt;math&gt;\Delta l&lt;/math&gt; to the load difference &lt;math&gt;\Delta F&lt;/math&gt;, and then estimate the elastic modulus from

 &lt;math&gt;E = \frac{\Delta \sigma}{\Delta \epsilon} = \frac{\frac{F_2}{S_2} - \frac{F_1}{S_1}}{\frac{l_2 - l_1}{l_1}}&lt;/math&gt;

Although, the procedure may seem perfectly straight forward at a glimpse, there are certain things that should be noted. Firstly,...

=Broad Implications=

As is the case with many other elementary physical laws, Hooke's law spans the small and simple, and the big and complex.  For instance, the theory is a good approximation of a simple test specimens subjected to axial loading.  Naturally, it is also an accurate physical model for linear springs.  And it is even valid for very complex structures, so long as they respond linearly.  These are all trivial and self evident statements, yet they are powerful and important.  Consider equation (1) and the relation below.

 &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \frac{F}{A}&lt;/math&gt;     (2) 

If there is only one load affecting a linear structure, then according to equation (1), the strain at any point varies linearly with the stress at any other point in the structure.  Furthermore, a linear stress measure at any point is a linear function of the applied load at that point, this is exemplified by equation (2).  So, the strain and consequently the stress at any point is in fact a linear response to the load at any point.  We conclude that 

 &lt;math&gt;\sigma_i = CF &lt;/math&gt;     (3) 

Where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a constant and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a load.

From equation (3) and the superposition principle we conclude that

 &lt;math&gt;\sigma_i = c_0 + c_1 F_1 + c_2 F_2 +...+ c_{n-1} F_{n-1} + c_n F_n&lt;/math&gt;     (4) 

Equation (4) describes a stress measure of a system subjected to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; loads.  The parameters of (4) can be obtained by performing &lt;math&gt;&gt;=n&lt;/math&gt; tests/calculations.  It follows that it is easy to, for instance, scale test results according to different safety factors.

It should also be noted, as is customary, that the stress-strain curve is identical during loading and unloading, if the system is linear.

It is important to know whether or not the structure is linear before drawing any critical conclusions from the theory of elasticity.  Common sources of non-linear behavior in a structure are material, geometric, contact and dynamic effects.

=Additional Aspects=

The simplistic view on elasticity presented in this section is useful in many ways, and is an excellent introduction to the subject. It should be noted however, that it is incomplete. The chapter &lt;i&gt;Continuum Mechanics&lt;/i&gt;presents a theory of how 2D and 3D stress and strain fields interact.Moreover, the material property &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, may be influenced by several factors, including: temperature and aging. If deformation time rates are very high, there might even be viscous forces present. Therefore, keep in mind that there is more to come on this subject later on in the book.

== The Camp Sheet ==

From time to time in this department I have mentioned an oiled muslin sheet for the camp outfit. In the first place it should be made with the idea of accommodating itself to the usages of a two man camp, because more often two go together than one alone; or more than two in company, unless it is a regular party camp, which is usually fully equipped. For two men you should buy a piece of sheeting such as is used in making ordinary bed sheets. This should be not less than twelve feet long, fourteen feet is even better. The cloth itself is about two yards wide, so that a piece of it fourteen feet long gives you a sheet about six by fourteen feet without a seam in it. When you have this piece of cloth, have it hemmed across the ends. Then get some boiled linseed oil and pour it on the cloth a little at a time, and rub the oil into the cloth between the palms of the hands as you go along. Rub in only enough oil to saturate the cloth without putting on oil enough to run. Painting it on with a brush will not do; you must rub it in with your hands. When you have rubbed the cloth full of oil, tack it up in the shade some place where the air will get at it, and let it dry for ten days. Do not put it in the sun at this time, and be sure that it is tightly stretched all around, putting your tacks close together entirely around the cloth. It should also be put where no rain can reach it until it has thoroughly dried. In the summer time ten days will dry it nicely, though the weather has something to do with this, and it may require even fifteen days to dry the oil as it should be dried. Do not try to rush this process, for you will not gain anything thereby.

After you have let the oiled sheet dry until it no longer feels sticky or &quot;tacky&quot; take it down and restretch it where the sun strikes one side one day and the reverse side the next. This should be kept up for perhaps six days, until the oil has hardened nicely in the glare of the sun. It is now &quot;cured&quot; so that it is absolutely water proof, and it will remain so as long as the cloth holds together. Even a great amount of folding will not make it leak unless you fold it in the same place right along and fold it down tightly, which process will in time break the oil film and give you a leaky sheet. The next thing to do is to take a good heavy cotton fish cord about the size of a lead pencil, and sew it to the edge of your sheet all around, turning the edge of your sheet over the cord and sewing it down the same as a bolt rope is sewed to a sail. Leave a three-inch loop in your cord at each corner, two more loops on each end and four or even five loops on each side of the sheet. These give you points to tie guy lines to or to use in any one of the dozen ways that you will find use for as you go along. When this cord is sewed in your sheet is finished, and it is the most useful thing in camp. It can be folded to carry in a pack, as it does not weigh a great deal and it has the advantage of being absolutely and reliably water proof. You can make a tent out of it that will hold two men and their equipment nicely, and in case of rain you can use it as a fly over another tent if you want to, or you can use it alone in many ways.

If you are not using a tent you can spread it out on the ground and make a bed for two men on the end of it; then pull it up and cover the entire bed with the other end, and you will have enough left to make an awning over your head. If you set up a pole on a couple of crotched sticks two feet high about the head of the bed, and stretch the surplus canvas out over the pole and guy the corners to stakes. This latter results in water-proof sheet under the bed and a water-proof sheet over it, with slope enough to the roof to run every bit of the dew or any rainfall entirely off the bed and bedding. Two men can sleep under this covering perfectly dry without a tent. Its water-proof qualities also make it wind-proof and it is a very warm bed covering for winter camping if it is tucked in at the edges or if strings are tied across from one side to the other from the loops. It then becomes practically a sleeping bag for two, keeps the bedding off the ground and protects the sleepers from the outside cold. It can be thrown over a boat and used as a water-proof boat cover in case you are camping in a canoe. It can also be used to cover the whole outfit in a canoe if you are traveling and rain happens to come on. In fact its uses are so many that it would be hard to enumerate all of them.

Make one and use it the next time you go camping, and you will never go without one thereafter. The treatment of the cloth as described above renders it absolutely water-proof and it is also a good idea to apply to provision bags or any article which you wish to water-proof.

== Rolling up your Bedding ==


Let me impress upon the minds of all travellers a golden rule: never omit seeing to the 'rolling' up of your bedding. There is a right and a wrong way of doing it; if managed as it should be, no wet can get into the blankets, however hard it may pour with rain, or if the pack-animal carrying the tent-freight amuses itself by rolling in every stream it arrives at, a pastime mules are very much predisposed to indulge in if they are not looked sharply after. Should the weather be fine, pack your 'dressing gear' if you are going to shift camp, 'strike' your tent, fold, roll, and place it in its bag, with the pegs and mallet, and tie your poles tightly together. Now carefully fold your blankets to the length, and a trifle narrower than the mattress, and lay them on it, double your buffalo robe, and place the mattress and its contents upon it. Begin at one end, and roll the whole tightly, turning in the ends of the ' robe' as you progress in rolling, having a stout cord or a small ' hide rope' ready to tie round as tightly as you can haul it. The more compact this bundle can be made the better it will be found to pack. Then spread the waterproof camp sheet, and lay the bundle on one side of it, and bring the edges of the waterproof over each end of the bedding, and thus continue to roll it in the camp sheet. By doing this it is next to an impossibility for water to find an entrance. The whole should, lastly, be securely lashed with a stout hide rope, or ' lasso.'

To find all one's bedding saturated with wet—a misfortune I have often had happen, arising to my trusting another with what I ought to have seen to myself— when camping after a day's march, would aggravate a saint. Those painted canvas 'bed envelopes,' artistically fitted up with buckles and leather straps, made round at each end, and bound with drab-coloured leather, containing what is called by outfitters a ' complete camp bed,' I would not accept as a gift, if compelled to take one abroad to be used for mule travelling. It may answer very well for army purposes, where all baggage is conveyed in wagons; but take advice, and never purchase a 'complete camp bed.' If you want what is really and practically useful, rather procure each of the articles I have recommended at the best shop, and of the best quality. A stout 'India-rubber camp sheet,' or a square of canvas soaked in boiled linseed oil, will answer better to wrap round your bedding than any 'case' or envelope made for the purpose I have as yet seen. With a 'case', if a hole rubs through it, or a snag tears it, there arises the immediate necessity to repair the damage, or the chances of a wet bed are before you. With a wrapper rolled many times round, the probabilities are ten to one against a hole being torn through all the enwraps; and if such a mishap should occur, why, it is only to alter the rolling, and the holes are securely hid, and hence effectually stopped.

Another advantage a plain camp sheet has over a 'bed case' is, that you can spread it on the ground when sleeping in a tent to place your mattress on; for in a tent a bedstead is a useless encumbrance. If it rains, and there is any chance of the water draining underneath the tent, all that is necessary is to fold the sides and ends of the waterproof up over the bed after you have safely turned in, and let the water find its way past and under you. There can be no fear of getting wet underneath so long as the edges are well turned up. I never use a pillow, as it increases the size of the bundle, and I find my clothes when folded up answer every purpose. Moreover, this plan keeps your garments from the chance of getting wet. We found this plan of sleeping on the ground, 'and rolling the bedding,' to answer admirably whilst doing the Commission work, and nearly all the officers dispensed with the ' bed case' altogether, and the bedstead during the summer field-work.

== General Comments on Tents ==


Although tents are not worth the trouble of pitching, on dry nights, in a healthy climate, they are invaluable protectors to a well-equipped traveller against rain, dew, and malaria. But a man who is not so equipped, who has no change of clothes, and no bedstead to sleep on, will do better to sleep in the open air, in front of a good camp fire. Napoleon I., speaking of soldiers, says (' Maximea de Guerre') :—&quot; Tents are not healthy; it is better for the soldier to bivouac, because he sleeps with his feet to the fire, whose neighbourhood quickly dries the ground on which he lies; some planks or a little straw shelter him from the wind. Nevertheless a tent is necessary for superior officers, who have need to write and to consult a map.&quot; To a party encamped for a few days, tents are of great use as storehouses for property, which otherwise becomes scattered about, at the risk of being lost or pilfered.

== Tent Pitched over an Excavation ==

A hole may be dug deeply beneath the tent floor, partly for the purpose of a store-room, and partly for that of a living-room when the weather is very inclement. This was practised before Sebastopol in the manner shown below. The notched pole acts as a ladder for ascending from below.

== Tent Pegs ==

Tent pegs should be of galvanized iron; they are well worth the weight of carriage, for not only do wooden ones often fail on an emergency, but cooks habitually purloin them when firewood is scarce.

== Materials for Tenting ==


Light canvas is usually employed, and is, to all intents and purposes, waterproof. Silk, of equal strength with the canvas, is very far lighter: its only disadvantage is its expense. Calico, or cotton canvas, is very generally used for small tents. Leather and felt are warm, but exceedingly heavy; and would only be used in very inclement climates, or where canvas could not be met with. Light matting is not to be despised: it is warm and pretty durable, and makes excellent awning or covering to a framework.

== Macintosh Sack ==


Mr. Falconer writes:  &quot;I travelled in 1841 from Austin in Texas to Mexico through New Mexico. I left Austin in June, and reached Zacateras on Christmas Day. During nearly the whole period we travelled from Austin to New Mexico, I camped without any covering at night for myself, except a large macintosh (a rubberized coat), made up as a sack, with a piece so laid as a continuation of one side, as to be used as a coverlet, sufficient in length to be brought from the back, over the head, and down on the breast. Inside I placed my blankets. I slept under this covering during many a heavy storm at night, and got out of my soft-coated shell dry in the morning. My opinion is, that every traveller who works his way with a horse should fix on his own saddle the said macintosh sack, two blankets, a tin cup, and a frying-pan. It is amazing, when you get into real working order, how few things are sufficient.&quot;

== Sheepskin Knapsack Sleeping Bag ==

These have heen used for the last twenty-five years by the French doaaniers, who watch the mountain-passes of the Pyrenean frontier. The bags are made of sheepskin, with the wool inside. When not in use they are folded up and buckled with five buckles into the shape of a somewhat bulky knapsack, which the recent occupant may shoulder and walk away with.

The accompanying sketches are drawn to scale. They were made from the sleeping-bag belonging to a man 5 feet 6 inches in height; the scale should therefore be lengthened for a taller person, but the breadth seems ample. Its weight was exactly seven pounds. The douaniers post themselves on watch more or less immersed in these bags. They lie out in wet and snow, and find them impervious to both. When they sleep, they get quite inside them, stuff their cloaks between their throats and the bag, and let its flap cover their faces. It is easy enough for them to extricate themselves; they can do so almost with a bound.

For the sake of warmth, the bag is made double from the knees downwards, and also opposite to the small of the back.

During the daytime, when the weather is wet or cold, the bags are of much use, for the douaniers sit with them pulled up to their waist. When carried in the manner of a knapsack the bag sits perfectly well against the shoulders; but, owing to the yielding nature of its substance, it lies too close to the back, and is decidedly oppressive. A wicker frame might well be interposed.

== Caches ==

To a people often on the move, the cache was indispensable. War or hunting parties often placed in reserve extra ammunition, moccasins, tobacco, dried meat, etc., in pits. A hole about four feet in depth and of sufficient size was dug, lined on the sides and bottom with stones and closed with a heavy slab of the same material, the whole concealed by a covering of earth. Should the party be separated, a straggler would open the cache and take what belonged to him, leaving the remainder for their rightful owners. However, food was seldom cached in this manner because rodents and other animals smelled it out and burrowed into the store. To meet this difficulty various expedients were resorted to. Dried provisions in a [[../Indian Lore/Indian Bags#parfleche|parfleche]] (an Indian rawhide bag) were sometimes hung in a tree near the trail along which a party expected to return. A safer method was to climb a tree beside a young birch, lean it over and tie the parfleche to the top. Rattles of hoofs or deer-claws were tied on to frighten small climbing animals. It was the belief of some, that gun powder rubbed over the package would have an analogous result. Again, food tied in rawhide bags was concealed in hollow trees. Fresh meat was sometimes tied to a stone and anchored under water. When in a rough country, holes in high ledges of rock were used, the opening being securely stopped with stones.

== A Lighter Camp Axe ==

Several years ago I worked out a scheme on a camp axe that may be of interest to fellow sportsmen. The weight of a standard axe is against it on many trips, and the standard hand axe is sadly lacking for effective work. That they are a little better than a heavy knife is about the best you can say for them.

To overcome the difficulty I purchased a hand axe of the &quot;easy-chop&quot; pattern, as the chip - breaker recesses would lighten it considerably. I took special pains to get one that was soft enough to sharpen with a fine file. An eight-inch flat file does not take much space or add appreciably to the weight of your kit and cuts faster than any stone.

My axe, like most of them, gets careless occasionally and brings up against a stone or a spike which blunts the edge instead of breaking out a chunk. The softness is especially desirable in bitter cold weather, as a spruce knot or stone has ruined many an axe when the thermometer was flirting with twenty below zero.

The second step was to remove the short handle and sort over the dealer's stock of axe helves. I found a helve for a boy's axe that was of fine straight grained hickory and about twenty-eight inches long. The axe was hung on this helve and then the helve scraped and sandpapered till it was thin enough to whip slightly under the weight of the axe.

This gives a combination that is twenty-seven inches over all and weighs thirty-two ounces.

You can split wood or chop without standing on your head and with your feet out of the danger zone. It's a real surprise what effective work you can do with this tool. Of course, it won't take the place of a standard axe for heavy work, but it is a vast improvement over the hand axe or hatchet, with very little increase in weight.

A sheath to slide down over the handle was made from an old piece of belting riveted as shown in the attached sketch.

Try it yourself, and you will find the little axe will not only go on camping trips but also see service around the house.

== Getting Rid of the Blanket/Sleeping Bag ==

The principal difficulty with the blanket and sleeping bag is not their weight, but their bulk. It is not hard to devise a light, warm, water-proof envelope to sleep in, but when you come to pack it!—well, by the time it and your tent and your cook-kit are assembled and a mountain of assorted clothes, provisions, and dingbats are piled around these and rolled up in one huge pack-cloth you begin to look like the rear end of a moving van! 

Then Peary's experiments with fur, in his efforts to eliminate the sleeping-bag and reduce weight and condensation troubles, were published. Any fabric that will soak up and hold moisture will at once loose its heat-resisting capacity. Absolutely kiln dry cotton is nearly as impervious to heat as wool.  But cotton in any form will take up water in its cellular fibres, thereby increasing its conductivity nearly ten times; and it will do this without being actually wetted, as it takes up dampness from the woods air. Any man who takes shoddy blankets or cotton quilts into the woods with him will pay dearly for it with cold, chilly sleeping, and rheumatism the following winter.

Eight years of living under Arctic conditions convinced him that wool must be discarded for fur, principally because any woven fabric will hold condensation, while fur will not. Even fur sleeping-bags were discarded because they would accumulate moisture from the body, and become heavy and conductive to heat. Now, as any camper will tell you, the most vulnerable part of your body as regards cold is from your knees to your hips, a distance on the average man of about two feet. The feet and lower legs are easily taken care of with wool socks and night slippers; and the upper part of your body lies close around the centre of combustion—your lungs; so no especial covering is needed there. 

Following these considerations, the night rig of the Peary party boiled down to a simple piece of fur, 2 feet wide by 4 feet long, which was wrapped around the hips, reaching down to the knees. From there on night socks of the fur of the Arctic hare presided over their pedal extremities, and for the upper part of the body the ''kooletah'', or hooded fur shirt, was made so that one could withdraw his arms from its sleeves and fold them across one's main decks when sleeping, drawing also the pucker string at the bottom of the shirt and at the hood to make the rig air-tight. Thus equipped, Peary's people got rid of 40 pounds of damp fur sleeping-bags per man, and were able to turn in on a snow-bank at 54 below zero and sleep comfortably.

== Handling Very Heavy or Bulky Loads ==

Very heavy and/or bulky load should be handled across the back.

There are many pack-bags or sacks on the market but they are only useful for ordinary camping trips. In really serious packing the loads carried are so heavy and of such bulk that a pack-bag of a restricted shape is useless. In carrying our loads we used an adaptation of the Russian-Aleute pack-strap of my own make. It was composed of padded canvas, and when it was adjusted over the shoulders, the principal weight came on the chest strap. There was no possibility of chafing, and the harness was light and easily adjusted. Whenever heavy loads are carried the &quot;tump-line&quot; or forehead strap is a necessity, as a heavy weight can be borne on the head and neck.

== The Aleute (Belmore Browne) Pack Strap ==

Although I had been experimenting in a small way, it was not until I had tried the pack-strap used by the Aleutes on the south coast of Bering Sea that I was successful in evolving a pack-strap that has few, if any, faults.

The first thing that struck me on seeing the Aleute harness was its extreme simplicity, for it consisted of nothing but a piece of wood with two long strings made of walrus hide attached to each end. The stick was formed to fit the chest and the strings passed over the shoulders, around the pack, and, passing under the arms, ran upward to the breast-stick where they were fastened by a half hitch. On using the harness I found that the breast-stick was upward and outward where the shoulder-strings pulled, and downward and outward where the strings from the bottom of the pack pulled. It took only a moment to see that a soft piece of cloth could be used in place of breast-stick and that the shoulder-strings could be changed for broad straps of canvas padded with cloth with small ropes sewed into the ends. It took less than an hour with the aid of a palm and needle to make the experiment, and the result was the most satisfactory harness that I have ever used.

In 1910 I equipped a party of five men in addition to myself with this pack harness and we packed an outfit that at the start weighed more than twelve hundred pounds, from the Chulitna River to Mount McKinley, a distance of forty miles over glacier ice. It was the first time that I had subjected the harness to such a severe test and it won the unqualified approval of every man. Since then I have carried packs of more than one hundred pounds, day after day, through the trailless wilderness north of the Alaskan Range, and after long trial and the hardest use I believe it to be the simplest, lightest, and most easily adjusted pack-strap known.

My reader must not make the mistake, however, of believing that by merely equipping himself with a good pack-strap he will be able to carry a heavy pack without fatigue or inconvenience, for he is doomed to disappointment. The mere fact that a fifty-pound pack adds just so many pounds to the weight of a man's body results in a heavy strain on his muscular system, and such a strain cannot be endured without acquiring experience, strength and sticktoitiveness.

== The Tump Line (Boy Scouts of America) ==


The method of carrying weight by the head and neck originated among the Indians of the eastern United States and Canada. The strap is called the &quot;tumpline&quot; and consists of a soft band of some strong material which passes over the forehead with the ends hanging behind the shoulders. The burden is made fast to the ends of the tump-line so that it rests against the back of the packer. Its chief advantage is the ease and rapidity with which it can be fastened to different kinds of packs, and this is a valuable asset where short portages necessitate the rapid loading and unloading of canoes. As one travels west, away from canoe and portage country, the tump-line is superseded by more elaborate harnesses, for, where there is no canoe water, men must carry their supplies day after day, and in carrying heavy loads with the tumpline the head is bent forward and downward to support and balance the weight and continuous travel in this position becomes irksome. The pack also lacks security, and where men must use their arms to climb or chop trail the tump-line is not satisfactory.

To my mind the greatest value of the tump-line lies in the ease with which it can be combined with the shoulder strap. As an illustration we will suppose that two scouts have gone on an overnight camping trip. They are carrying twenty-five pounds apiece in their knapsacks, when an accident makes it necessary for one of the scouts to carry both loads. After tying the two knapsacks together he starts onward, but before he has traveled far he finds that the weight is beginning to hurt his shoulders. It is at this point that the knowledge of how to use a tump-line will save him hard work and suffering. Taking two strings—shoelaces will do—he ties them to the outside lower corners of the knapsacks. He then ties the loose ends to his handkerchief and adjusts them so that when he stands up with the handkerchief across his forehead, his shoulders will be relieved of a considerable portion of the weight. This method of distributing weight between shoulder straps and tumpline is one of the most important lessons to be learned in packing.

== The Tump Line (Warren Hastings Miller, Clark Wissler) ==

Like the birch-bark canoe, portages and packs have been with the native Red American since long before the white man came. Curiously, the original Iroquois pack, with its wooden frame, is the type which represents the survival of the fittest, for the latest pack of the present moment is of this type, after years of trial with pack baskets, harness, packsacks, and rucksacks, all of them white man's inventions. The Indian had just two carrying devices, the tump strap and its thongs, and the carrying frame. These two seem to have been universally distributed all over the country. With modifications, you will find them from the Micmacs of the extreme Northeast to the Papagos of the Southwest, the tump strap being made of every conceivable natural material from rawhide to woven basswood fibre, and the frame varying in the same way, according to the material available in the region in which the particular tribe lived. &quot;With the Iroquois it was made entirely out of mockernut hickory, including the tump line, not a stitch of animal matter appearing in the makeup; with the Pima and Papago the frame is a mere natural fork of mesquite, spreading a deep net of yucca fibre. With all of them the two main natural principles of big weight portable by the strong neck muscles, and a frame holding the load off the small of the back and transferring its thrust to the brisket muscles, are the guiding motives in the design.

For, while a load with shoulder harness is very limited—say, 60 pounds as a maximum—the amount that can be carried with the tump line and frame runs up into the hundreds of pounds. The reason why shoulder harness has such a low limit is not the fatigue nor the disposition of the load on the shoulder blades, but the mere fact that constriction of the big arteries of the arms is produced by the pressure of the straps passing up from under the armpits over the breast muscles.

== Trail Hikers Outfit ==

{{stub}}

The thing most impressive about my first extensive wanderings in a semi-wilderness, was a sore back necessitated by toting enough sporting goods to equip an Arabian expedition for a month's journey in the Sahara. I had a partner whose ideas were to the opposite extreme. He insisted that a small fry pan, rifle and blanket were the only articles necessary for a protracted trip of exploration anywhere on the American continent. At first I accused him of being a shiftless, lazy cuss, but before the end of our trip I agreed with him to the extent that I was willing to go one better by discarding the blanket.

It takes considerable practice to arrive at the &quot;happy medium&quot; of what is necessary and what is superfluous in a hiking outfit. Everybody has peculiar personal ideas and whims for certain things not necessary even to live in civilization. Some men will err on the side of taking too little; others on the side of taking too much.

Two hardy trail men are capable of taking everything necessary for their comfort for two weeks, at least, if due care is exercised to select articles of minimum weight. Dailey and I last year went into an unsettled country fully equipped for a three weeks' stay and tools to build camps, besides two guns, and our packs only weighed about ninety pounds each. With plenty of game and fish, which we did get, we could have lived in comfort for a month. It is not necessary to eliminate all the comforts of life to take a trip into the back-packing country; neither is it advisable to make life miserable by toting too much junk.

An experienced trail man can carry forty to fifty pounds with ease day in and day out. An Algonquin Indian thinks nothing of carrying a couple of hundred pounds over a long portage without a rest. Wielding a hoe or pick, I would tire out, body and soul, within a short time. But after a few weeks getting in trim in the fall I can propel myself very rapidly under a hundred pounds of traps or deer meat and consider sixty pounds a fair pack for hiking. Some of these go-light cranks claim they get a two weeks' hiking outfit down to thirty pounds, enumerating sundry articles of equipment besides rations, but I don't see how they do it. I would say forty pounds would be a safe estimate.

Whether a man takes much or little on the trail depends on his preferences and the object of the trip. If he is going into a sure game, berry and fish country, and has plenty of time, he can live almost an indefinite period on thirty or forty pounds of concentrated and properly selected &quot;store&quot; foods. On the other hand, if he is engaged in some duty that occupies all his time, or must arrive at a certain destination in a given time, his outfit and rations must be selected with utmost precision.

Most hiking trips are made for the purpose of prospecting, usually in the fall of the year. Trappers especially are accustomed to take a few days off prior to the trapping season and either look over their old trapping grounds or explore new ones.

The shelter problem is first to consider. If going into a snake, mosquito or insect infested country a tent is almost necessary. For North woods travel late in the fall where weight must be cut, I should depend on brush shelters or &quot;rock houses.&quot; Yet, a shelter tarpaulin made of balloon silk or similar light-weight material should not weigh more than three pounds and cost more than five or six dollars. Such an oblong sheet of tenting can be pitched into different forms of shelter, and erected in a moment's time.

Usually the outdoor man is dressed in woolen clothing and a wetting does little harm, but for hiking in the fall, khaki or corduroy may be more desirable and in these clothes it is not advisable to get wet more than necessary when far from medical aid. For this reason the tarpaulin or tent is more dependable than lean-to's. A lean-to requires time and making, not to mention experience. It is only fairly water-proof, and where trees do not grow, it is out of the question.

There is at least one compact tent on the market that weighs about six and a quarter pounds. My favorite tent is one that comes in two pieces, weighing about three and a half pounds, I believe. Where two men go together, as is the case, this is a very satisfactory t&quot;^1 piece makes a fair lean-to type shelter, t&quot; individually if the parties get separated, a two together make an &quot;A&quot; shaped tent.

The Compac tent is very practical i hikers, and is absolutely bug and mosqnh It may be pitched with or without psleeps two in fair comfort. There is not a room in the tent (quite unnecessary* rather difficult to prevent touching the nxij will bring the water through in a heav&gt; ta

Much care is necessary in selecting fo» Personally, I wouldn't wear anything sell's Ike Walton boots for both foot a ai:d protection. They cost a little more rial siore goods, but you get it back in service, viar should fit properly. Never make the ke of trying to break in a pair of shoes on a The moccasin style boot is most satisfactory ail going.


»ki or corduroy is noisy but otherwise satory for woods use during the fall. Flannel , light woolen underwear, and soft felt hat, &quot;pen country, or cap for the woods, comthe clothing needs. A sweater may be , is necessary and serves for a pillow at , A coat is useless in the woods; however, men prefer a vest for its handy pockets.

It is of aluminum and weighs about two pounds, lure.

ten a trip is taken by car, boat or wagon, we ake along hams, beef, potatoes, cabbage or an&gt; thing a finicky appetite may dictate. But it must all be carried on the back day after intil consumed, the food question is not one solved at the point of purchasing over the ry counter. One should know something ative food value of various foodstuffs, proper ig (if not scientific), and &quot;balanced rations.&quot; i it comes to food, I am like a lot of old fellows, I can live indefinitely on flapjacks aeon. But I do know from experience that &gt;ld trail gag won't keep a man in the best i. Somehow or other strenuous outdoor life &gt;ps such a voracious appetite the same thing &gt;e eaten day after day without tiring of it. i.e. food may not be balanced or sufficiently icus so that the insatiable appetite is a direct ng the body is not properly fed. ewith is the food list I used last year for &gt; weeks' trip for two men. Owing to so game and fish, at the end of the two weeks med we had as much as when we started, ice and pancake flour, I believe, were run^hort. The crisco was unnecessary, as we &gt;acon grease for cooking. It gives an excelavor to the food :

ke prepared flour 10 Ibs.

STARTING ON THE TRAIL.

In a pinch for light weight 1 could cut this list some, but the foods listed are necessary for good health. Fruits should be taken evaporated; also a dehydrated vegetable would be desirable. The raisins and sweet chocolate are excellent foods for munching on the trail, and there is no other food that will keep a man going so long. Cheese and macaroni are two valuable concentrated foods, but are not always practical for trail use. Rice supplies everything that is in potatoes and is not nearly so bulky and heavy. Baker's powdered egg is excellent for cooking purposes, but can be dispensed with.

One or two wool blankets on a bed of balsam boughs makes an excellent bed, with the sweater for a pillow. A six-ounce air pillow can be taken for the tenderfoot. In the South, where rattlesnakes and copperheads are a menace, I use a light hammock, swinging it several feet off the ground.

In the ditty bag, so named, I believe, by that pioneer of go-lighl trail, &quot;Xessmuk,&quot; should be

==Ingredients==

''Bolognese Sauce''

* 2-3 tbsp of olive oil
* 1 onion (chopped)
* 2-3 cloves of garlic (finely chopped)
* 1 sprig of rosemary (remove ‘leaves’ from sprig and chop)
* 1tsp of dried oregano 
* 2-3 mid sized carrots (chopped, about 1/4 inch or shredded)
* 1-2 sticks of celery (chopped, about 1/4 inch)
* 1 lbs of ground beef
* 3-4 cups of tomato pulp
* 7-10 basil leaves (depending on size, finely chopped)
* salt and pepper

''Bechamel Sauce''

* 1 quart of whole milk
* 1/2 cup of flour
* 1/2 cup of butter
* salt, pepper
* 4-5 sprigs of fresh thyme
* nutmeg

''What else...''

* one box of Lasagne plates
* 1 1/2 cups of grated mozzarella

==Tools==

* large pot
* medium sized pot, preferably with thick bottom
* deep casserole dish

==Procedure==

''Bolognese Sauce''

# cut all ingredients that must be chopped before starting to cook
# heat olive oil in large pot on medium heat
# put in onion and garlic, stir
# let fry for about 2-3 min., careful: donnot burn the garlic!!
# after 1 min add rosemary and oregano
# enter carrots and celery, stir
# let cook for another 2 min
# add ground beef, stir
# cook until all is browned
# add tomato pulp, stir
# add basil, salt, pepper, stir
# cook everything for about 20 min, stirring occasionally
# if it gets too thick, add some water

''Bechamel Sauce''

This is difficult to make. Here's an easy teach to it:

Foodwishes on Youtube[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvv74RJd6AA&amp;feature=player_embedded]

I couldn't explain it better


''Bringing it all together...''

# preheat oven to 390°F/200°C
# cover bottom of casserole dish with a bit of Bolognese sauce
# cover with a layer of Lasagne plates, break to fit if necessary
# layer on some Bolognese sauce and Bechamel sauce
# keep on layering Lasagne plates, Bolognese sauce and Bechamel sauce until edge of dish reached
# cover with mozzarella
# bake for about 30-40 min

==Tips==

* Bolognese sauce is also a great pasta sauce to go with spaghetti
* Dish can easily be prepared a day ahead, bake when needed (time might be a bit less, please check)

Hope you wouldn't mind participating on the &quot;vote&quot; to restore the [[Wikibooks:Administrators#Becoming_a_CheckUser|CheckUser (CU) function]] (mostly used to fight vandalism) to the Wikibooks project, a &lt;u&gt;minimum of 25 expressions of support is required&lt;/u&gt; to grant the flag to administrator Thenub314 (this will also enable admin Adrignola to get the function active again, since there is a minimum requirement of 2 active Wikibookians with the flag). In case you do agree to participate, your vote needs to be added to [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_permissions#Thenub314.C2.A0.28talk.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0email.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0contribs.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0logs.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0rights.29_.28CheckUser.29|administrator Thenub314 request for permission]].

Question, I made an alteration to the font size and in my edit the phrase &quot;From Wikibooks, open books for an open world&quot; returns (not the it is a big problem but my feeling is that it is redundant, and in your edit it wasn't present. I presume that it has to do with the page cache and the time to update the use of the new template am I correct ?
I will be using it in most of the book projects I'm working on. Thanks...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 21:44, 25 January 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Types of Macromolecules|macromolecules]] in living organisms; they are what act out the duties that are encoded in [[Structural Biochemistry/Genetic code| genes]]. In humans they help our bodies to repair, regulate, and protect themselves. [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|Proteins]] help in the building and repair of tissues, and in body processes such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Water|water]] balancing, nutrient transport, and muscle contractions. Many essential [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzymes]] and hormones are proteins. Proteins are basically essential for life. The reason that proteins can carry out such a diverse set of functions is because they are able to bind to other proteins specifically and tightly. Their binding ability can be contributed to their tertiary structure that creates a binding or active site; the chemical properties of the surrounding amino acids' side chains also have a large influence on the binding ability of proteins. 

Proteins acting as enzymes are probably their most important function. Enzymes are the biological catalysts that are essential for almost all the biological systems in our bodies to work, they are what catalyze reactions in processes like metabolism, DNA replication, and digestion. Enzymes are extremely specific and will only catalyze certain reactions. The high specificity is related to the structure of the substrate and the enzyme. The enzyme will bind only to an active site only in the substrates which is complementary to its structure, like a key in a lock. Protein-protein interactions regulate this enzymatic activity.

Proteins are also essential for cell signaling and molecular transport systems. Because a protein produced by one cell can bind with a protein from another cell, they provide good cell signal and molecular transport pathways. An example of a protein that acts in this fashion is hemoglobin. Hemoglobin binds iron molecules and transports them from the lungs, through the blood stream, to all the essential organs and tissues. This examples shows how essential proteins are in living systems. [[File:Hemoglobin_t-r_state_ani.gif‎|100px|thumb|Structure of Hemoglobin]]

There are also structural proteins such as actin and tubulin that polymerize to form the cytoskeleton of a cell. The essential motor proteins such as myosin, kinesin,and dynein are also structural proteins.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=General Information=

Structural [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]] are essential for providing structure and rigidity to [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Fluid Mosaic Model|fluid]] biological cells and components. Structural proteins are fibrous proteins which provide support for the cells. Structural proteins are usually very large and are made up with up to thousands of [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]]. Insects and spiders use silk fibers to for various tasks such as making their cocoons and webs &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;&gt;Biology, Eight Edition,Pearson, Benjamin Cummings, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;. Another example of a structural protein can be seeing in Keratin which is the protein of hair, feathers and horns among other things &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;.  Actin and collagen are specific examples that fall under this category of proteins. Collagen, recognized as one of the most abundant proteins in mammals, is the main component in connective tissue. Collagen can be found in the tendons, ligament and skin. Collagen can also be found abundant in cornea, cartilage, bone, and blood vessels. Collagen composes about 25-35% of the entire protein content in the human body, which illustrates the importance of structural proteins such as this in the body. 

[[Image:Actin_strand.png|300px]]
==Key Properties==
Not only proteins serve an important role as the structural components, it also participates in all of the biological processes.  For example, transport, storage, catalytic reactions, immunity, nervous system, growth, and etc.  There are four general properties that allow proteins to function in such wide varieties:  
#Protein is formed with monomers called “amino acids” and it is connected from one end to the other, becoming a linear polymer.  The unique sequence of the amino acids causes the chain to fold into three dimensional shapes called “protein,” which the function is also determined by the shape.  Because of the endless possible sequences of the amino acids, the folded protein world is also capable of intense diversity and varieties.
#Protein carries many kinds of functional groups such as, thiols, alcohols, carboxylic acid, and etc.  Because these functional groups are reactive, it gives the protein wide range of reactive properties. 
#Protein’s ability to interact with other macromolecules also increases the range of functions.  Unlike other macromolecules, the ability to interact allows the proteins to develop into complex assembly with other molecules.
#The combination of rigidity and the flexibility of the protein is another reason for its usefulness in biological structures.  Flexible proteins may work as a spring, hinge, and a lever while ridge proteins can play a role in cytoskeleton structures.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The English/Imperial measurement system is slowly being eradicated, so Metric should be used first in all recipes, and the decapitated Imperial system shown afterwards in (parentheses) only if originally produced in that system. There only .3 Billion Americans vs. 6.4 Billion Metric Users. Using Imperial simply does not make sense any longer. Besides the cup and spoon measurements are not the same in any country, it is &lt;big&gt;Not&lt;/big&gt; an universal measurement. A milliliter, mL, and the gram, g, is the same everywhere.

Sadly, America does not seam to want to belong or want to work with the rest of the World. Funny, that it wants World Free Trade, but it is the only country trading in Imperial based units and products. American workers are the only ones in the world that must have Two sets of tools and hardware, American and Metric, in order for them to get any job in America. Americans CEOs simply do not get it, but then, they do not work with their hands. So how is it cost competitive to have Two sets of hardware, in stock, when the rest of the World only have one?</text>

&lt;math&gt;\alpha = &lt;/math&gt; angle between transverse load and the investigated cross section &lt;br&gt;

==Summary of Formulas==

&lt;math&gt; F_{R||} = 0.6 A f_{wd}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; F_{R\alpha} = A \frac{f_{wd}}{\sqrt{2 + cos(2 \alpha)}} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;

Where:

&lt;math&gt;f_{wd} = \phi \frac{\sqrt{f_{uc} f_{euc}}}{1.2 \gamma_n} &lt;/math&gt; ;if &lt;math&gt; f_{uc} &lt; f_{euc} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;or,&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f_{wd} = \phi \frac{f_{euc}}{1.2 \gamma_n} &lt;/math&gt; ;if &lt;math&gt; f_{uc} &gt;= f_{euc} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;

Interaction formula:

&lt;math&gt; (\frac{F_{S||}}{F_{R||}})^2 + (\frac{F_{S\alpha}}{F_{R\alpha}})^2 &lt;= 1&lt;/math&gt;

==Partial Coefficients==

&lt;math&gt; \phi = 0.9&lt;/math&gt; in most cases. &lt;math&gt; \phi = 1&lt;/math&gt; is acceptable for high quality butt welds.

&lt;math&gt; \gamma_n = 1.0, 1.1 &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;1.2&lt;/math&gt; depending on whether failure repercussions are regarded as mild, severe or very severe.

&quot;an exemplarily implenentation of quick sort is provided by libkde3::qsort()&quot; or &quot;Huffman's compression is done understandable in gzip::huffman()&quot;?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Octaves==
Using octaves is a useful way of reinforcing melody lines. When a melody is played simultaneously at different octaves; the ear interprets it as a single melodic voice. Octave lead playing stands out and is not that difficult to master. Any melody you know can be expanded to include octaves. The diagram below shows three octave pairs of the note C. All are movable and once grasped can be incorporated into your playing with ease. Wes Montgomery was a jazz guitarist who made octaves his trademark and his influence is heard in the work of the guitarist George Benson.

==Proposed Improvements==
===Level 1.02===
The mapping 'ch' -&gt; /k/ contradicts rule 1.03, so should be treated as an irregular spelling and moved to level 4. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 19:35, 27 November 2009 (UTC)
===Levels 3.01 &amp; 3.02===
The mapping 'e'-&gt;/ə/ is rather late and delays the availability of words like 'le' &amp; 'que'. It should perhaps be moved forward to before rule 1.02. Mapping 'e'-&gt;/(ə)/ is more difficult and could be left in place. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 19:35, 27 November 2009 (UTC)</text>

== Define Your Presentation's Objectives ==

Oral presentations are designed using some of the same techniques that you would use in written communication; however, there are different techniques since oral presentations are another form of communication.  To accurately accomplish what you want to present, it is important to analyze the situation by looking at four differing aspects.

•''Think about your listeners and your communication goals''- Know who your listeners are and how you want your presentation to affect them. For example, ask yourself what you really want to tell your listeners and what they really want to hear from you.

•''Think about what your listeners expect''- Understand what your listeners’ expectations are about the presentation. For example, ask yourself, &quot;what is the purpose of my listeners hearing me?&quot;

•''Know the time limit of your presentation''- Listeners appreciate knowing how long the presentation will take. Have your watch or clock with you anytime you present.

•''Assess the environment of your presentation''- 
*'''The size of your audience:''' With a smaller audience, you can use smaller graphics, present in a less formal manner usually, and can expect to be interrupted with questions.
*'''The seating of your audience:''' Consider what the seating is like and if your audience will be able to move their chairs to best see the visuals.
*'''The type of equipment available:''' The availability of equipment determine the types of graphics you can use. If a projector is not available, you will not be able to use PowerPoint or slides.

== Planning the Verbal and Visual Parts of Your Presentation ==

===Why Use Visuals?===
'''Speakers who use graphics are viewed as:'''
*Better prepared
*More professional
*More understandable
*More persuasive
*More credible
*More interesting
To gain the full advantage of the combined communicative power of the verbal and visual dimensions of your presentations, you must integrate them fully. First choose the type of oral delivery and the visual medium you will use. Then plan how you will weave your words and images together.

===Choosing the Type of Oral Delivery===
Oftentimes at work, people generally use three forms of oral delivery: the scripted talk, the outlined talk, or the impromptu talk. Sometimes the situation or the profile of your listeners will dictate the types of talk you will give. At other times, you will be free to choose.

'''''Scripted:'''''
A scripted speech is a word-for-word speech. Everything is written out that the presenter is planning to say. It can either be read or recited from memory. This offers security to the presenter if he/she is nervous or has a lot of specific or complex important information he/she needs to inform the audience about. It is also helpful for keeping within a time limit. Having a scripted talk ensures the presenter that each key point will be talked about, but be careful because this can make the speech rigid and is hard to deliver naturally. 


'''''Outlined:'''''
An outlined speech is just that, a speech that has been outlined to hit its main points. The outline helps the presenter remember to touch on a certain topic and offers more flexibility to “tune” the speech to the reactions from the audience. With this type of speech the presenter should be knowledgeable on the subject matter. Some may have trouble with phrasing an outlined speech or get tongue-tied. If critical information is not written down the presenter may forget to fully elaborate on key points that are vital to the success of the speech. This type of presentation is ideal when presenting information that is familiar to you.


'''''Impromptu:'''''
An impromptu speech is given with little or no preparation. The presenter should be very knowledgeable on the subject matter. It is not uncommon for information delivered to the audience to be disorganized. Impromptu speeches are usually used in short informal meetings where the audience can interrupt and ask questions to help guide the speech and retrieve the information they need from the speaker. Although, depending on how interactive the audience is, without the help of proper questions, the speaker may miss the main point of the speech entirely.

==Who is Your Audience?==

When planning out your speech remember that in order for it to be effective it needs to be tailored as best as it can to reach the specific audience. If your audience cannot understand what you are trying to say you will find it much harder to deliver your message. This means that you should figure out who your audience is so that you can format your presentation accordingly. The easiest way to figure out your audience is to focus on their characteristics.


'''''Be Mindful of Your Audience's:'''''

•	Age 

•	Knowledge Level

•	Gender

•	Occupation

•	Ethnicity and Culture

•	Values and Morals 

•	Goals



'''''Keep in mind though; your audience members are &lt;big&gt;individuals&lt;/big&gt; not stereotypes.''''' 

If you do not know much about your audience, research! Researching your audience can only benefit you, the more that you know the better prepared that you will be. If you are presenting to another culture or non-English fluent audience, doing research cannot be stressed enough. Different cultures have different ways of presenting speeches. For instance, in the Chinese culture all of their points are made indirectly and speeches do not give the audience an overview of what their presentation will cover. You will find instead, an introduction offering an observation of a concrete reality followed by a story. 

→Important aspects to research include: 

''Opening format, organization style, directness, tone, eye contact, gestures, and visuals''


'''''Basic Guidelines That Would Be Safe to Follow For Any Speech:'''''

•	Avoid Slang (Generational gaps must always be kept in mind)

•	Use Graphics to Highlight Key Points (Pictures can help break confusion or a language barrier)

•	Use Full Sentences Not Phrases (Phrases can make you sound unintelligent, or lazy)

•	Avoid Using Gestures (A friendly gesture in one culture could be considered rude or offensive in another)

•	Avoid Jargon (Language or terminology that is industry specific)

•	NEVER Discriminate (This includes age, gender, race, ethnicity, etc.)

•	Maintain Good Eye Contact (Maintain with the entire audience, not just a select few)

•	Speak Up (You want to sound confident and knowledgeable to your audience)

== How Will You Start Your Introduction? ==


'''''Will you start with a quote, statistic, personal story, a joke, or an overview?'''''


'''''Opening:'''''
There are many ways to start a speech before segueing into an introduction, beginning with a quote, statistic, personal story, or even opening with humor are all good options; but only if they are used correctly. So be careful, because humor is only funny when it is told right, and humor can do more harm than good if it is not used properly. Be sure to avoid all sexual, religious, and racial topics if you open with humor. As far as opening with a statistic, quote, or sharing a personal story, it doesn’t matter which one you choose, just be aware that they have to be directly related to the main point of the speech. 


'''''Overview:'''''
An overview should follow whichever opening you choose, or can be just used as an opening. Formal speeches usually start with an overview as an opening. Using an overview as an opening would be the best to use if you are unsure how your audience will react to a joke or a startling statistic. Your overview for your introduction should contain the following: a brief introduction of your topic, an explanation of the relevance of the topic to your audience, a forecast of the organization for your presentation, and possibly some background information if necessary.

== What the Body of Your Speech Should and Shouldn’t Include ==


The body of your speech should help you elaborate and develop your main objectives clearly by using main points, sub points, and support for your sub points. Try to limit both your main points and sub points to three or four points each, this goes for your supporting points as well. Select your main points according to the relevancy of your audiences need and interest. Develop a logical structure for your points, shorten words and phrases whenever possible, and be sensitive how your words sound, not just look. Keep you listeners in mind while writing, and if necessary make a good argument by citing evidence and providing examples. Don’t get set on using certain words and ignore the main goal of your speech. Also, use repetition, it adds rhythm to your speech and helps the words stick in your listeners mind. 


'''''George Orwell Summarized How to Write Well:'''''

•	Never use a long word where a short one will do

•	If it is possible to cut out a word, always cut it out

•	Never use the passive where you can use the active

•	Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent

•	Break any of these rules sooner than say anything barbarous (meaning: uncivilized, primitive, or lacking refinement)

== Don’t Forget About Your Conclusion! ==

The last thing presented tends to be what the audience remembers best. Restate your main points in a short summary. You can create a lasting impression by using one of the techniques to open a speech with, a statistic, fact, or personal story, but remember only do so if it can directly relate. If possible, summarize the next steps your audience can take, and lastly always thank your audience.

== When Should You Ask for Questions? ==

Traditionally, the speaker asks for questions after the speech is finished and has thanked the audience. That is not always the case though. A speaker can guide the audience to ask questions throughout his/her speech, by simply pausing in between points and asking the audience. Or, a speaker could politely ask the audience to hold all questions until the end. If the speaker does not ask the audience members to hold all questions until the end, he/she should be prepared for interruptions and rehearse accordingly. 


'''''Tips for Answering Questions:'''''

•	Make a point to have everyone hear the question, repeat the question if you are in a large room and then follow-up with a response so that every audience member is aware.

•	If you do not know the answer to a question simply say so, do not lie, and explain any relevant information you do know.

•	If an audience member asks a question in disagreement with your topic, remain in good terms. Politely and respectfully acknowledge the opposing thoughts. 

•	If an audience member interrupts your speech with a question, answer it, and return to where you left off.

== What Visual Aids Will You Use? ==
To help your audience focus on and remember your major points, you should present them verbally and visually. Visual aids can help your audience better understand what you are talking about and reinforce the point you are making. Before you decide which types of visual aids to use, you need to figure out where you will be presenting, what technology will be available, and your audience. Figure out about the layout of the room and the seating, if you can move the seating around (if necessary), as well as how large your audience will be. These all will play a factor in choosing which visual aids you should use. 

 
'''The Four Most Common Visual Aids:'''

•	'''PowerPoint''' – a visual aid which can incorporate sound, video clips, photos, charts, tables, and graphs.

''Advantages'':  Is beneficial for large audiences, easy to modify slides in a timely manner, and creates a colorful, attractive design for viewers. 

''Disadvantages'':  It has to be shown in a room with dim lighting which makes note taking for listeners difficult.  Depending on seating, screen size, and room layout not everyone may be able to see.  A projector and computer/laptop is needed which can be expensive to buy and challenging to rent. Also, many people make &quot;poor power point presentations.&quot; Make sure to research what is proper power point etiquette before presenting. 


•	 '''Overhead Transparencies''' – slides can be written on and observed through an overhead projector.

''Advantages'':  Allows you to maintain eye contact with the audience, able to be write while talking towards the crowd, and can be created easily. Also, easy for note taking.

''Disadvantages'':  Transparencies are plain looking without motion or sound, and has to be shown in a room with dim lighting.  A large, deep room may have visibility problems from the back of the room. Overhead projectors are becoming outdated and contain light bulbs which may burn out.


•	'''Chalkboards/Dry Boards''' – boards which can be written on with chalk or dry erase markers.

''Advantages'':  There is no preparation necessary, very flexible, can be used to record audience responses, and are great for discussions.  Fast, easy, and simple to use. No learning curve.

''Disadvantages'':  Writing on a chalkboard/dry board can delay the presentation and may make you talk to the board instead of the audience.  Does not present well for large groups and poor spelling and handwriting can become problematic. No sound/motion available. 


•	'''Handouts''' – materials with key points and information for the audience to use.

''Advantages'':  Beneficial for large and small audiences and aid listeners with note taking.  The audience is able to refer to the information later on.  Can enhance key points of presentation by reiterating the points.

''Disadvantages'':  Requires preparation and access to a copier.  Audience members may read ahead or never look at the handout again. May be a distraction to the presentation.

== Make Sure Your Visual Aid Uses Easy-to-Read Text and Graphics ==

Use graphics! People identify items more quickly when using graphics in addition to text alone.  When creating your visual aids, however, make sure your text and graphics are easy to read. 


	'''Labeling'''

	•Use headlines and sub headlines in a larger font

	•'''Bold''', ''italicize'', or CAPITALIZE important information

	•Use bullet points or create lists to organize material. Make sure this is &quot;nice&quot; to look at (easy to read)


'''Charts and graphs''' 

	•Make sure there is clear information presented and support your presentation. Color coordinate charts/graphs if necessary

	•Use text to support/explain your charts and graphs (be brief but cover the high points)

	•Avoid charts and graphs that can be misleading to your readers



	'''Wording and Lettering'''

	•Use large sized easy to read fonts

	•Be concise with as little text as possible.  Also use simple language to avoid confusion

	•Limit number of fonts to one or two

	•Think about the age of your audience when setting font size and type

	•For slides, limit the number of lines to no more than six lines per slide with six words per line

	→Overcrowding slides is common and can be easily avoided by limiting the amount of text


	'''Color'''

	•Use color for clarity and emphasis, not for decoration

	•Use color schemes

	•Keep a similar color scheme throughout the entire presentation

	•Use contracting colors to highlight main points

== Making a Proper PowerPoint ==

We have all encountered boring power points with overloading information and lack of creativity. The following are precautions to ensure that you are making a proper power point using PowerPoint etiquette. 

•	Do not write the entire presentation on your Power point. Instead, create bullet points and headings no longer than three to five words that give the main points.

•	Have no more than five to seven lines per slide.

•	It is better to have two slides than it is to cram to much information on one.

•	Be consistent with your &quot;theme&quot;. (Do not use a different theme for each slide)

•	Do not overuse transitions. They are meant to enhance your presentation, not take over.

•	Be careful with your color scheme. Again, this is meant to enhance your presentation. Make sure the audience can read the text.

•	Make an outline of what you will be talking about so the listeners can know what to expect within the presentation.

•	Use at least 18 point font, and for each sub-bullet portion use a smaller font size. 

•	Do not use complicated and unreadable font.

•	Use a font color that stands out against the background.

== Preparing for Your Speech  ==

When preparing to give your speech, it is important to rehearse just as you plan to present it. This, then, includes using your visual aids when you practice.  This is necessary to do, since it trains you to make smooth transitions between slides. Take time into consideration as well- it is hard to sit through a long speech, even if it is interesting. Usually, people can only concentrate for about twenty minutes at a time. This may mean you need to break your speech up into two parts if it is lengthy.  Doing this gives the audience a short break in between and allows them to refocus and retain the important information.  


'''''Rehearsing''''' 

•       Pay special attention to the delivery of your key points; this is typically where stumbling for your words can become the greatest problem.

•	Speak in a conversational style.  Do not talk '''at''' your audience; pretend you are talking '''with''' your audience.

•	Prepare for interruptions and questions.  On this note, make sure to leave room for a formal time of questions at the end of your presentation.  

•	Practice pausing in your speech after important information you would like to stress, as well as when you are transitioning from one main point to another.  By doing so, the audience can better digest the information and reflect on what they have just heard.

•       Rehearse with your graphics and coordinate them to your talk.

•	Display your graphics only when you are talking about them.  Graphics should support your presentation, not detract from it.

•	Time your rehearsal, and use the same pace you will use when you present.

•	Rehearse in front of others.  Feedback can improve your speech and having an audience for practice can pin-point weaknesses in the presentation.

•	If possible, rehearse your speech in the location you will be giving it. This will allow you to feel more comfortable when you are giving your presentation.

•	Make sure you hear your speech aloud, either by recording it, or listening carefully to yourself during rehearsal. This will enable you to make sure that your words flow smoothly in an understandable manner.

== Presenting Your Speech ==

Your appearance and delivery are just as important as your speech. You want your audience to give you respect and to take you seriously, so show your audience this by how you dress and in how you present your speech. For your dress, consider what your particular audience will expect of you, in most cases this means business casual, but sometimes a suit/dress may be necessary.


'''''Dress to Impress:'''''

•	Men – button-up shirt and tie, blazer (optional), dress pants, and dress shoes. Be clean shaven and have tidy hair. 

•	Women – button-up shirt, blouse, or a nice sweater, dress pants or skirt (of appropriate length – below the knee), and dress heals or flats. Not too much make-up and have tidy hair. Avoid large dangling jewelry, as this can be distracting to your audience.


'''''Deliver Your Message''''' 

Act poised and confident; don’t let your nerves get the best of you. Accept your nervousness and work with it, everyone understands how it feels to be nervous and will be supportive. When rehearsing identify your weak spots, practice fixing them, as well as practice hitting the crucial points in your speech. Do your best to avoid fidgeting, pacing, looking at the floor, and over using “um”, “uh”, or “and”. Try to breathe easy and pace your speech. The most important thing to remember before giving your speech is to deliver your message. If you forget to say certain points it is fine, just deliver your message and let the audience know the main objective of your speech. Also, find comfort in knowing your nervousness is not as visible to others as it is to you. 


'''''Body Language'''''

While standing in front of a large or small audience for a presentation body language is crucial.  Audiences may become distracted with flailing laser pointers or fidgeting fingers playing with a useless pen or paperclip.  As a presenter remain relaxed and calm while creating animated and lively facial expressions.  Always remember to smile, maintain eye contact with the audience, and enjoy your experience as being a presenter.


'''''Tips That May Help Calm You:'''''

•	Practice and rehearsal- the more you practice, the less nervous you will be

•	Arrive early

•	Talk with a few of the audience members before your speech

•	Take a few minutes to relax before you speak

•	Pause for a moment before you start talking 


'''''Involve Your Audience''''' 

The great thing about presenting a speech is you can gauge your audiences understanding by paying attention to your audience. If your listeners are looking confused, you can ask if they understand before moving on to the next point and back-up and re-explain your points as needed. Make eye contact with your audience members, and make sure not to stare at your notes the whole time. If you have a large audience, make sure to alternate talking to the audience members to the right and left of you as well as in front of you. When you begin your speech do not look at your notes, look at your audience! You know your topic and who you are so introduce yourself and your topic as you would introduce yourself when you meet a new person.

''Tips For Looking At Your Listeners''

•	Look at your audience before you begin

•	Create and follow a plan for looking

•	Pick a particular feature of your listeners' face

•	Practice looking at the audience while rehearsing

•	Avoid skimming over faces in your audience

== Extra: Team Presentations ==

Team presentations are becoming increasingly common in the workplace. Usually each person will specialize on a certain part in the project and then each will present the piece of the project he/she is most knowledgeable on. 


'''''Team Presentation Tips:'''''

•	Make plans in advance and set dates for team meetings

•	Plan thoroughly

•	Allow for individual differences

•	Make effective transitions between speakers

•	Show respect for one another

•	Rehearse together 

•	Be familiar with all parts of the presentation

•	Have speakers discuss how the pieces fit together if it is unclear

== Checklist: ==

'''''Preparing For Your Speech'''''

•	Which speech will you present? (scripted, outlined, or impromptu)

•	Who is your audience? (Consider: age, gender, knowledge base, etc.)

•	What is your introduction? (Will you begin with a statistic or story? Or Start with an overview?
What is your objective?)

•	What is in body of the speech? (Elaborate on your main points)

•	What is your conclusion? (Will you add a statistic in at the end? Be sure to summarize your main points and thank your audience!) 

•	When will you ask for questions? (Throughout the speech or at the end?)

•	Which visual aids will you use? (PowerPoint, blackboard/dry board, handouts, or overhead transparencies?)

•	Are you graphics easy to read and understand?

•	Don’t forget to rehearse! (Yes, with your graphics!) 

'''''Helpful Tips'''''

• Do not chew gum while your giving your speech

• Do not put your hands in your pocket, to stop yourself hold a pencil or a pen in your hand(make sure not to figit with it though)

• If your nervous, take a deep breath before you begin

• If your nervous about the crowd size, try and focus on one person until you feel comfortable 

• If you lose your place, calmly look down at your notes rather than saying &quot;um&quot; or &quot;ah&quot;; it is better to pause for a moment to find your place than to fumble with your words

• If your feeling under the weather when giving your speech, bring a bottle of water with you because you can always pause for a second to take a sip 

• When rehearsing, try practicing in front of a mirror so you see if you have any bad habits that you can try and correct before giving your speech 

'''''Presenting Your Speech'''''

•	Dress to impress!

•	Arrive early!

•	Look at the audience not your notes or the presentation screen

•	Don’t forget to involve your audience! (Talk with them, not at them!)

•	Smile and present with energy

•	Deliver your message

•	Thank your audience!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Understanding Objects==

To work with Sage you have to know a little bit of Python, because it is the underlying language Sage is written in '''and''' it is the language Sage understands!

* Objects: An object is a data structure with methods that operate on the data inside an object. In Python - and Sage - everything is an object, even the number &quot;1&quot;.
* You can store objects in variables. That is a string of characters where only a-z, A-Z, digits (digits must not be at the first position) and the sign &quot;_&quot; is allowed (e.g. &quot;abs_1&quot;). To accomplish this, enter &quot;x=1&quot; and indicate with &quot;Shift-Return/Enter&quot; that you have ended your input. 
* To access the data (the object's value) behind the variable, you have to enter it and probably write &quot;print&quot; in front of it.
* The methods of an object can be accessed via the &quot;.&quot; sign and then comes the name and parenthesis &quot;(...)&quot;, where they can be empty or have arguments.
* The data stored inside an object is accessed similarly just by the &quot;.&quot; and the name but with no parenthesis.
* Functions are objects that do not need an object.

Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# storing the object &quot;11&quot; in &quot;x&quot;
sage: x = 11

#show me &quot;x&quot;
sage: print x
11

# factorial() is a method of x
sage: x.factorial()
39916800

# sqrt is a function
sage: sqrt(x)
sqrt(11)
&lt;/source&gt;

* Objects can be combined with others:
** using an operator sign like &quot;+&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, ...
** inserting them into the argument list of a method or function

Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# operator &quot;+&quot; adds the values of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;x&quot;
sage: x+x
22

# function &quot;n&quot; evaluates the numerical value of &quot;sqrt(11)&quot;
sage: n(sqrt(11), digits=50)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Staff making is a simple, easy, yet effective way to make a walking companion or an effectively defensive weapon in cases of emergency. Simply look for a sapling that is a little higher than you and is as thick as you feel comfortable. The lumber must be stripped from its bark and dried for three to four weeks. After the drying process, make sure the wood is brown, and not any shade of green. Taper the end of the stick with a blunt end, and offer an oil stain or preserving finish. Then you can apply accessories (like a grip, engravings, etc.). What is strongly recommended my many is that the end of the stick (the one that will be touching the ground) has an added metal tip on the bottom, like those used for chairs and sofas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to browse collections using an HTML web page and narrow your choices as you type.

== Method ==
We will first create a server-side script that takes a single parameter.  This is the collection path that the user is entering into an input field in a web page.  With each character the user types the list of possible sub-collections is narrowed.

There are three parts to this script:
1) the server side XQuery script
2) the HTML form
3) the JavaScript file that implements the JavaScript with AJAX functions.

== Sample Server-Side Script ==

get-child-collections.xq
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
 
declare function local:substring-before-last-slash($arg as xs:string?)  as xs:string {
if (matches($arg, '/'))
   then replace($arg,'^(.*)/.*','$1')   (: by default matching is eager :)
   else ''
 };
 
 let $title := 'Get child collections starts with prefix'

(: if we don't get any value then use the root collection :)
let $collection := request:get-parameter(&quot;collection&quot;, '')
let $before-last-slash := local:substring-before-last-slash($collection)
let $after-last-slash := substring-after($collection, concat($before-last-slash, '/'))

let $sub-collections := xmldb:get-child-collections($before-last-slash)

(:
collection={$collection}&lt;br/&gt;
before last &quot;/&quot;={$before-last-slash}&lt;br/&gt;
after last &quot;/&quot;={$after-last-slash}&lt;br/&gt;
:)
return
&lt;div class=&quot;results&quot;&gt;{
   if (count($sub-collections) = 0)
     then 
        &lt;h1&gt;There are no subcollections of {$collection}&lt;/h1&gt;
     else
      &lt;div class=&quot;selections&quot;&gt;{
         for $child in $sub-collections
         let $child-path := concat($before-last-slash, '/', $child)
         order by $child
         return
            if (starts-with($child, $after-last-slash))
              then
                 &lt;div class=&quot;selection&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;browse.xq?collection={$child-path}/&quot;&gt;{$child}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            else ()
       }&lt;/div&gt;
}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Enzymes are proteins that can accelerate biochemical reactions. They can transfer energy forms. Their functions of catalyze are very specific. They only catalyze certain reactions and when certain substrates are present. They usually do not have side products. It is important to understand that enzyme only fasten the reaction but not change the reaction equilibrium. In other words, with the presence of the enzyme, the reaction proceed thousands times faster, but the amount of final products are the same as without the presence of the enzyme.

The catalytic activity usually depends on the presence of cofactors, which is not a protein. An enzyme is called apoenzyme if it is not bound to cofactors; An enzyme is called holoenzyme if it is bound to cofactors. Cofactors are divided into two groups: metal and coenzymes. Metal cofactors can catalyze in many ways. They can ease the formation of nucleophiles, stabilize intermediates, and link enzymes and substrates. Coenzymes are small organic molecules. They can be bound to enzymes tightly or loosely. They are called prosthetic groups if they are bound to enzyme tightly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Terminology==

The open ball in a metric space &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; with radius &lt;math&gt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt; centered at a, is denoted &lt;math&gt; B(a, \epsilon) &lt;/math&gt;. 
Formally &lt;math&gt; B(a, \epsilon) = \{x \in X: d(a,x) &lt; \epsilon\} &lt;/math&gt;

==Definition==

Let &lt;math&gt; (X,d) &lt;/math&gt; be a metric space. We say a set &lt;math&gt; A \subset X &lt;/math&gt; is open if
for every &lt;math&gt; x \in A \text{ } \exists \epsilon &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; B(x,\epsilon) \subset A &lt;/math&gt;.

We say a set &lt;math&gt;B \subset X&lt;/math&gt; is closed if &lt;math&gt;X\backslash B&lt;/math&gt; is open.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

== Images lacking license information ==

 
Thanks for uploading images on Wikibooks. However, the images may soon be deleted unless we can determine the copyright holder and copyright status. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about the images included in Wikibooks because of [[w:Copyright|copyright law]] (see Wikibooks' [[Wikibooks:Copyright|Copyright policy]]).

The copyright holder is usually the creator, the creator's employer, or the last person who was transferred ownership rights. Copyright information on images is signified using copyright templates. The three basic license types on Wikibooks are [[w:open content|open content]], [[w:public domain|public domain]], and [[w:fair use|fair use]]. Find the appropriate template in [[Wikibooks:Image copyright tags]] and place it on the image page like this: &lt;code&gt;{&amp;#123;TemplateName}}&lt;/code&gt;.

Please signify the copyright information on [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=upload&amp;user={{urlencode:{{PAGENAME}}}} all images you have uploaded] or will upload. Remember that images without this important information or giving false information can be deleted by an administrator. If you have any questions, ask them in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]]. Thank you.</text>

Thanks, you and any other contributor I've had any contact with have been very helpful!

Im new to writing tutorials, so ill be happy for any help you lot can offer.

Ill probably end up reading all of that while writing this wikibook over the next month, all appreciated.

:I've been doing some work on [[Video Game Design]] if you have the time make a reference there to [[Creating a Simple 3D Game with XNA]] and add a link from one book to the other. Remember to sign your posts.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:32, 29 November 2009 (UTC)

:I will, when its a little bit more complete. Im planning on this being a month long project, ill look through it and find the right section for it then.--[[User:Willybood|Willybood]] ([[User talk:Willybood|talk]]) 00:49, 29 November 2009 (UTC)

==Images==
If your pictures are of Blender, then they should have the {{tlx|free screenshot|GPL}} template on them instead, since blender is licensed under the GPL. Right now they would be deleted with no fair use rationale, but fair use rationale only applies to software programs that are copyrighted under a non-free license (doesn't apply to Blender).  You could and should upload them to [[commons:|Commons]] instead at that point because they are freely available. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:54, 1 December 2009 (UTC)


== [[:Image:XNA logo.png]] uses an incompatible license ==
{{mbox|type=warning|msg=
'''Thanks for uploading [[:Image:XNA logo.png]].''' The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about what Wikibooks includes because of [[w:United States copyright law|copyright law]], and requires that we maintain a strict [[Wikibooks:Copyright|copyright policy]]. [[:Image:XNA logo.png]] and other files you uploaded may soon be deleted because their license is incompatible with [[WB:GFDL|the license]] that Wikibooks uses, and no valid fair use claim has been made.

If this image is available under a free license, please edit the image description page directly to add the corresponding [[WB:ICT|template]] ''without removing other templates''; there's no need to upload the image again. An administrator will review the license and source information, and finalize the template messages on the image page. You will likely be asked to send a permission email to permissions-en@wikimedia.org for our [[m:OTRS|OTRS]] team to verify.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''typedef''' keyword is used to give a data type a new alias.
&lt;code&gt;
    typedef existing-type new-alias;
&lt;/code&gt;

The intent is to make it easier the use of an awkwardly labeled data type, make external code conform to the coding styles or increase the comprehension of source code as you can use typedef to create a shorter, easier-to-use name for that data type. For
example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 typedef int Apples;
 typedef int Oranges;
 Apples coxes;
 Oranges jaffa;
&lt;/source&gt;

The syntax above is a simplification. More generally, after the word &quot;typedef&quot;,
the syntax looks exactly like what you would do to declare a variable of the
existing type with the variable name of the new type name. Therefore, for more
complicated types, the new type name might be in the middle of the syntax for the
existing type. For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 typedef char (*pa)[3]; // &quot;pa&quot; is now a type for a pointer to an array of 3 chars
 typedef int (*pf)(float); // &quot;pf&quot; is now a type for a pointer to a function which
                           // takes 1 float argument and returns an int
&lt;/source&gt;

This keyword also covered in the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Style Conventions#typedef|Coding style conventions Section]]. 

{{NOTE|You will only need to redeclare a typedef, if you want to redefine the same keyword.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Add 3 cubes ('''spacebar &gt; Add &gt; Mesh &gt; Cube''') and evidently separate them.



select the middle cube and press S and shrink the cube SLIGHTLY smaller than the left one.

Do the same with the one on the right.
Select the Left cube and press F5. Click Add New.
Under the Material tab make the color

R 0.930
G 0.084
B 0.084

Select the middle cube and press F5. Click Add New (if it's there).
Under the Material tab make the color

R 1
G 0.638
B 0.000

Select the right cube and press F5. Click Add New (if it's there).
Under the Material tab make the color

R 1
G 0.957
B 0.011

Do everything that follows to each of the cubes

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Particle System tab make sure that the box says &quot;Emitter&quot;. for now, keep these settings...

Basic:
Amount 2000
Sta 1.0
End 250
Life 50
Rand 0.0

Emit From:
change Faces to Volume
change Jittered to Grid

Physics tab/
Initial Velocity:
Object 1
Normal 1
Random 1

Global effects:
AccZ 2

Visualization tab/
Change Point to Circle
Size is enabled
Emitter is enabled

--------

Now move the Yellow and Orange cubes inside the Red one. Hit B and drag a box around the red cube and move the three cubes to the center of the screen.

select the red cube and (in Physics) click on the Bake tab
Click Bake
make sure the camera has a nice view of the box
Press F10
Click Animate (this might take a little while) 
Then,after its done animating, FINALLY press play and watch the fire!!!

== New pages ==

You made [[A Guidebook for Managing Telecentre Networks/Acronyms]] and [[A Guidebook for Managing Telecentre Networks]].  Was the former supposed to be part of [[A Guidebook for Managing Telecentre Networks: Engineering a New Phase of the Telecentre Movement]] and the latter a mistake? -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:27, 28 November 2009 (UTC)

: thnks for the reminder . i was just a mistake.

== question for administrator ==



{{adminhelp}}
i have uploaded the following screenshots to commons for my wikibook [[A Guidebook for Managing Telecentre Networks: Engineering a New Phase of the Telecentre Movement]]. but they are saying that it has a license problem . i need your help for the appropriate licensing .  
&lt;gallery&gt;

File:Apc.org_website.png
File:Www.iyv2001.org_website.png
&lt;/gallery&gt;

You've put a notice that you are releasing them under the GFDL, which is a good license in and of itself.  However, they are screenshots of websites licensed under the Creative Commons Noncommercial Share-alike license.  Therefore, they are not licensed under the GFDL (you didn't create the content pictured in the screenshots), but rather they are licensed identically to the websites, under the CC-NC-SA license.  Commons and Wikibooks do not permit images to be uploaded that have restrictions on them that prohibit commercial use.  I'm afraid you will not be able to use these screenshots under their policies.  You'd need to get screenshots of websites that state their content is licensed under the [[Wikibooks:Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License|Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License 3.0]] license. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:50, 29 November 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Parfleche ==

Parfleche or rawhide bag. As to form, they are of two types — those opening on the longer side and those opening on the shorter side. All vary much in size, ranging from 20 to 60 cm., on the longest side. The proportions of the two sides on a denominator of 10, range from 6 to 9. They are closed by a flap and are held in place by two thongs passed through as many holes in their edges. The edges are covered with cloth, either blue or red. The sewing is by an over stitch, holes being punched in the edges of the rawhide through which a single thong is passed, always from the same side. Apparently this sewing starts from the bottom of the bag. A knot is tied in the thong, some distance from the end, so that in the finished bag, the loose ends hang freely from the corners, forming simple pendants. However, two bags in the collection are sewed with a single thread passing in and out instead of over the edge. The short carrying strap is fastened on the back near the top. One large bag is provided with a strap long enough to pass over the shoulders. The faces of these bags and the flaps are decorated with painted designs.

To fill the parfleche, it is opened and the contents arranged in the middle. The large flap is then brought over and held by lacing. The ends are then turned over and laced. The closed parfleche may then be secured by both or either of the looped thongs.

Primarily, parfleche were used for holding dried meat, dried berries, tallow, etc., though utensils and other belongings found their way into them when convenient. In recent years, they seem to have more of a decorative than a practical value; or rather, according to our impression, they are cherished as mementos of buffalo days, the great good old time of Indian memory, always appropriate and acceptable as gifts. The usual fate of a gift parfleche is to be cut into moccasin soles. With the possible exception of the Osage, the parfleche was common among all these tribes but seldom encountered elsewhere.

      <comment>/* Editing your Cube */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== First Screen ==
The biggest problem with Blender for new programmers is its learning curve. After a little practice and experience it does become fairly intuitive, but for this reason a gentle introduction to the opening screen and the basic interface is necessary before moving on to making your models.

[[File:Blender First Screen.gif|thumb|centre|When you first open blender, you see this screen]]
The following three elements can be seen
#'''A cube''', with a red cursor in the middle
#To the right of that, '''the light source''' (a pair of small circles)
#And to the lower right of the middle, '''the camera''' (a pyramid)
For purposes of XNA and this tutorial, we do not need to worry about the light source or camera, that will all be handled on the code side.

== Basic Controls ==
You can rotate this view around freely by holding down the middle button and moving the mouse, and can be zoomed in and out using a mouse wheel. The numpad can be used to rotate and zoom more uniformly;
*1, 7, and 3 aligns the current view to an axis
*4/6 and 8/2 rotates the display by 15 degrees on an axis
*'+' and '-' zooms in and out

The left key moves the cursor (a red and white circle with a crosshair around it) around the screen, by moving this you can change the current view (by pushing 'C' after moving it re-centers it to that position) and dictates the position where new shapes are placed.

The right key selects different objects on the screen, with the currently selected object highlighted in pink.

== Editing your Cube ==
Next, select the cube by right clicking on it, then change the view mode from the default object mode, to object editing mode by left clicking on the 'Mode' tab.
[[File:Mode.gif|centre]]
Change this to editing mode. While in this mode, you have the option of modifying the different physical aspects of the model, which can be split into three different types:
#'''Faces''', the solid areas of the model, which are surrounded by...
#'''Edges''', lines connected by...
#'''Verteces''', which dictate the different positions of the edges.
This is probably best seen visually by changing between different select modes for these types using the below buttons, and selecting them on the cube.
[[File:Editing selection.gif|centre]]

When you select one of these parts (for the sake of the below example pics, one of the front facing faces), they can be edited in the following basic ways:
[[File:Editing face vanilla.gif|thumb|centre]]
*'''Translate''', which moves the selected element
[[File:Vanilla with translate.gif|thumb|centre]]
*'''Scale''', which allows you to increase the size of the selected parts (by default, around the centre of the selected area)
[[File:Vanilla with Scale.gif|thumb|centre]]
*'''Extrude''', which acts similar to the above translate, but creates a new set of faces at the extrusion point (which is frankly, a lot easier to understand by seeing and playing with it then it is to describe it)
[[File:Vanilla with extrude.gif|thumb|centre]]

In any of these editing modes, they can be affixed to a particular axis by hitting the X, Y, and Z key.

Going through the rest of this tutorial, some of the more advanced facets of Blender, and the details behind these functions will be explored through examples, but this at least provides the framework for the creating any simple model.

Let &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; be a metric space, and let &lt;math&gt;A \subset X&lt;/math&gt;. We call &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; a limit point of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if for any &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; there exists some &lt;math&gt;y \neq x&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;y \in B(x,\epsilon)\cap A&lt;/math&gt;.

We denote the set &lt;math&gt; lim(A) &lt;/math&gt; the set of all &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a limit point of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many cancers are caused by the defective repair of DNA and by mutations in genes associated with growth control. Defects in DNA-repair systems increase the overall frequency of mutations and, hence, the likelihood of cancer-causing mutations. Indeed, the synergy between studies of mutations that predispose people to cancer and studies of DNA repair in model organisms has been tremendous in revealing the biochemistry of DNA-repair pathways.

[[Image:Dna repair.png|thumb|A DNA repair mechanism.]]

Genes for DNA-repair proteins are often [[Structural Biochemistry/Tumor suppressor genes|tumor-suppressor genes]]; that is, they suppress tumor development when at least one copy of the gene is free of a deleterious mutation. When both copies of a gene are mutated, however, tumors develop at rates greater than those for the population at large. People who inherit defects in a single tumor-suppressor allele do not necessarily develop cancer but are susceptible to developing the disease because only the one remaining normal copy of the gene must develop a new defect to further the development of cancer.

Cancer cells often have two characteristics that make them especially vulnerable to agents that damage DNA molecules. First, they divide frequently, and so their DNA replication pathways are more active than they are in most cells. Second, cancer cells often have defects in DNA-repair pathways. Several agents widely used in cancer chemotherapy, including  cyclophosphamide and cisplatin, act by damaging DNA. However, because chemotherapy drugs are largely non-specific, this results in damage to healthy cells and other side effects. 

== Disorders ==

There are a few human disorders characterized by defects in DNA repair. 

1. Xeroderma pigmentosm – the patients with XP have clinical sun sensitivity, a lot of freckle-like lesions due to sun explosion and about 1000-fold increase of developing skin cancer. Several of XP patients have progressive neurologic degeneration. XP cells are very sensitive to UV and have defected DNA repair.  The defective genes in XP are involved in nucleotide exclusion repair. 

Nucleotide exclusion repair (NER) is a process that is carried out by proteins; these proteins' codes are in the genes, XPA-G, in which are the genes that are affected by mutations that are linked with XP cases. This process (NER) is a method by the cells to get rid of dangerous injuries created in the genetic components by UV rays from the sun. So, for patients with XP, this process does not work correctly. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://www.geneskin.org/dna-repair-disorders.aspx], DNA-Repair-Disorders.&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Cockayne syndrome – the patients with this syndrome have sun sensitivity, short stature, and progressive neurologic degeneration. Unlike XP, Cockayne syndrome patients are very sensitive to killing by UV and have defective DNA repair of actively transcribing genes. It also contains two complementation groups. The defective genes also are involved in both nucleotide exclusion and transcription like XP, yet the precise function is unknown.

Roughly half of CS patients will display a changed cellular response to UV rays as a result of mutations in the genes, CSA and CSB. The genes CSA and CSB both code proteins that are related in repairing a particular portion of the DNA that is in current use by the cell.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://www.geneskin.org/dna-repair-disorders.aspx], DNA-Repair-Disorders.&lt;/ref&gt;

3. Trichothiodystrophy – the patients with TTD have photosensitivity, short stature, mental and growth retardation and sulphur deficient brittle hair. It does not associate with cancer. TTD patients’ cells are also very sensitive to killing by UV and have defective DNA exclusion repair.  The defective genes in TTD are found in one of the XP complementation group.

About half of TTD patients, who display sun sensitivity, have a defect in their nucleotide excision repair. This is a result from mistakes in one of three genes, which are the following: XPB, XPD, and TTDA. With recent findings, there are patients with non-photo-sensitivity, due to a defect in the gene C7orf11(TTDN1). &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://www.geneskin.org/dna-repair-disorders.aspx], DNA-Repair-Disorders.&lt;/ref&gt;

== BRCA1==

BRCA1 is a gene that is involved in DNA repair via homologous recombination. When one allele of this gene is mutated, there is a 85% risk for breast cancer and 30-50% risk for ovarian cancer. BRCA1 produces the BRCA1 tumor suppressor protein, which is made up of 1863 amino acids. This protein can be divided into several domains: RING, exon 11, coiled-coil doman, and BRCT. 

RING - This domain consists of the first 150 amino acids of BRCA1. BRCA1 heterodimerizes with BARD1, BRCA1-associated RING domain protein.

Exon 11 -  This domain is the middle 60% of the protein. 

Coiled-coil domain - This domain is associated with PalB2 and its interactions with BRCA2, another tumor suppressor protein. PalB2 connects BRCA1 and BRCA2 together. It is also active in homologous repair of BRCA1 and BRCA2.

BRCT - This domain interacts with phosphoserine residues on binding partners and facilitates in DNA double-strand breaks localization.

BRCA1 and BRCA 2 are proteins that are closely associated with breast and ovarian cancer.  The gene’s main job is to repair any double stranded breaks (DSB) and fight against cancer caused by mutations on the DSBs.  BRCA1 and BRCA2 do not work independently to repair the breaks, but have specific jobs and work through a protein network.

BRCA1 acts as a coordinator of all the proteins necessary to repair the break because of its and damage sensing abilities.  It first binds to the DSB using RING (Really interesting new gene), which is encoded and forms the BARD1 complex.  If the RING part of the BRCA1 protein is mutated or disabled, BRCA1 becomes unable to bind to a DSB and the likelihood of cancer increases.

BRCA1, the coordinator, then recruits PalB2 that in turn attaches BRCA2 to the complex.  BRCA2, unlike BRCA1, has a large role in repairing DSBs and is known as an effector that uses Rad51 to help use homologous recombination to repair the DSBs.  When the protein complex fails to use homologous recombination, Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is used- often leading to further complications.  

Ultimately, to best repair DSBs, the BRCA1-PalB2-BRCA2 complex needs to be fully functioning.&lt;ref&gt;Links between genome integrity and BRCA1 tumor suppression. Li ML, Greenberg RA. Trends Biochem Sci. 2012 Oct;37(10):418-24. doi: 10.1016/j.tibs.2012.06.007. Epub 2012 Jul 24. PMID: 22836122 [PubMed - in process]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Ames test was named after its developer, Bruce Ames, and is a method for determining if a chemical is a mutagen, an agent that causes mutations. This test is used by many cosmetics companies, pharmaceutical companies and other industries to prove that their products will not cause cancer or harmful in that way in humans. The use of this test is based on the assumption that any substance that is mutagenic may also turn out to be a carcinogen, to cause cancer.  A positive test shows that the chemical can act as a carcinogen. If the substance is a carcinogen, it will cause mutation in the bacterium as the cell divide. The mutant cells will have the enzyme to form colonies.

In the Ames test, a thin layer of agar containing about 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; bacterial of a specially constructed tester strain of Salmonella is placed on a petri plate. T hese bacteria are unable to grow in the absence of histidine, because a mutation is present in one of the genes for the biosynthesis of this amino acid. The addition of a chemical mutagen to the center of the plate results in many new mutations. 

The bacterium used in the test is a strain of Salmonella typhimurium, which carries a defective gene making it unable to synthesize the amino acid histidine from the ingredients in its culture medium. Yet, some of mutations can be reversed with the gene regaining its function. These are able to grow on a medium lacking histine. Since cancer is often linked to DNA damage, the test can also quickly estimate the carcinogenic potentical of a compound as it is hard to determine whether standard carcinogen examination on animals were successful. 

A small proportion of them reverse the original mutation, and histidine can be synthesized. These revertants multiply in the absence of an external source of histidine and appear as discrete colonies after the plate has been incubated at 37 Celsius degrees for 2 days. A series of concentrations of a chemical can be readily tested to generate a dose-response curve. These curves are usually linear, which suggests that there is no threshold concentration for mutagenesis. 

Some of the tester strains are responsive to base-pair substitutions, whereas others detect deletions or additions of base pairs. The sensitivity of these specially designed strains has been enhanced by the genetic deletion of their excision-repair systems. Potential mutagens enter the tester strains easily because the lipopolysaccaride barrier that normally coats the surface of Salmonella is incomplete in these strains. 

A key feature of this detection system is the inclusion of a mammalian liver homogenate. Since some potential carcinogens such as aflatoxin are converted into their active forms by enzyme systems in the liver or other mammalian tissues, bacteria lack these enzymes. So the test plate requires a few milligrams of a liver homogenate to activate this group of mutagens. 

This test is extensively used to hep evaluate the mutagenic and carcinogenic risks of a large number of chemicals. This rapid and inexpensive bacterial assay for mutagenicity complements epidemiological surveys and animal tests that are necessarily slower, more laborious, and far more expensive. The Salmonella atest for mutagenicity is an outgrowth of studies of gene-protein relations in bacteria.

The picture shows the Ames test. A suspension of a his- strain of Salmonella typhimurium has been plated with a mixture of rat liver enzymes on agar lacking histidine. The disk of filter paper has impregnated with a carcinogen. The mutagenic effect of the chemical has caused many bacteria to regain to grow without histidine to form the colonies around the disk. The scattered colonies on the disk represents spontaneous revertants.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Structural Biochemistry/Protein function/Allosteric Regulation|Allosteric enzymes]] are an exception to the Michaelis-Menten model. Because they have more than two subunits and active sites, they do not obey the Michaelis-Menten kinetics but instead have sigmoidal kinetics.Since allosteric enzymes are [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein function/Binding Sites/Cooperativity|cooperative]], a sigmoidal plot of V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; versus [S] results: 

[[File:Allosteric v by S curve.svg]]

A sigmoidal plot has an S curve resulting from the combination of the T state and R state curves. The T state curve would be lower than the curve shown here, and the R state curve would be higher. Unlike many enzymes, allosteric enzymes do not obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The reason for this is that allosteric enzymes must account for multiple active sites and multiple subunits. Thus, allosteric enzymes show the sigmodial curve shown above. The plot for reaction velocity, vo, versus the substrate concentration does not exhibit the hyperbolic plot predicted using the Michaelis-Menten equation. With allosteric enzymes, the catalytic activity affecting one substrate can alter the properties of other active sites located within the same enzyme. The result of this interaction equilibrium is a cooperative effect, meaning the binding of the substrate to an enzyme's active site affects the binding of substrate to other active sites. This property of cooperativity accounts for the sigmodial curve of vo versus the concentration of substrate.  

'''A. Introduction'''

Allosteric enzymes are unique compared to other enzymes because of its ability to adapt various conditions in the environment due to its special properties. The special property of Allosteric enzymes is that it contains an allosteric site on top of its active site which binds the substrate. The binding of a nonsubstrate molecule to the allosteric site functions to influences the activity of the enzyme. In influencing the activity, it can either enhance or impair the activity of the enzyme. Another important property of allosteric enzymes is that it also contains many polypeptide chains with multiple active and allosteric sites. The nonsubstrate molecules that bind at the allosteric sites are called allosteric modulators. 

Example:

A clear example of an allosteric enzyme is aspartate trascarbamoylase. The enzyme catalyzes the first step in the synthesis of pyrimidines. The enzyme functions to catalyze the condensation of aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate to form Ncarbamoylaspartate
and orthophosphate. The enzyme ultimately catalyzes the reaction that will yield cytidine triphosphate (CTP). This allosteric enzyme is unique in that for high products of the final product CTP, the enzyme activity is low. However, for low concentrations of the final product CTP, the enzymatic activity is high. The allosteric nature is thus represented as the CTP molecule has a odd configuration or shape that is unlike the substrates. Rather than binding to the active site, CTP binds to the allosteric site. Thus, CTP functions as an allosteric inhibitor decreasing the enzymatic activity of the enzyme. This enzyme also has separate regulatory and catalytic subunits on separate polypeptide chains. There are instances though when CTP concentrations remain high and cells in the body need more enzyme. This is when a different allosteric molecule ATP functions to attach to the allosteric site and functions as enzyme activator enhancing the activity of the enzyme. Thus, even with high concentrations of CTP, the enzyme activity could be enhanced because of ATP, which also acts on the allosteric site. This example explains the benefits of allosteric control and the ability allosteric enzymes to adapt to various conditions of the environment. This is particularly helpful for cells because there are occasions when the cell requires an allosteric activator like &quot;ATP&quot; to enhance the enzyme even when it is inhibited due to high amounts of product. (CTP) The aspect of feedback inhibition is represented as well as high amounts of product acts to inhibit the action of the enzyme acting in a inhibitory manner. 

'''B. Properties of Allosteric Enzymes''' 

There are distinct properties of Allosteric Enzymes that makes it different compared to other enzymes.

(1) One is that allosteric enzymes do not follow the Michaelis-Menten Kinetics. This is because allosteric enzymes have multiple active sites. These multiple active sites exhibit the property of cooperativity, where the binding of one active site affects the affinity of other active sites on the enzyme. As mentioned earlier, it is these other affected active sites that result in a sigmoidal curve for allosteric enzymes.

(2) Allosteric Enzymes are influenced by substrate concentration. For example, at high concentrations of substrate, more enzymes are found in the R state. The T state is favorite when there is an insufficient amount of substrate to bind to the enzyme. In other words, the T and R state equilibrium depends on the concentration of the substrate.

(3) Allosteric Enzymes are regulated by other molecules. This is seen when the molecules 2,3-BPG, pH, and CO2 modulates the binding affinity of hemoglobin to oxygen. 2,3-BPG reduces binding affinity of O2 to hemoglobin by stabilizing the T- state. Lowering the pH from physiological pH=7.4 to 7.2 (pH in the muscles and tissues)favors the release of O2. Hemoglobin is more likely to release oxygen in CO2 rich areas in the body.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi there thank you for having me as a member...
My intrest is on/how our body operates/study on human digestion system/organs, colons &amp; ect...

I work as an instructor for disability and wish to explore more on human oragans and how they function.

I also wish, if permited to buy a cd containing informaions/or dvd on the issues????

thank you Bobby T DEAN

:You may want to look at the [[Human Physiology]] book.  It is a featured book with quality content.  I know Wikipedia has CDs/DVDs collecting much of the encyclopedia, but we don't have that capability here.  This book in particular does have a a [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/c/cd/Human_Physiology.pdf PDF version] and [[Human_Physiology/Print_Version|print version]].  You can use the PDF version to save the book to your computer or the print version to print the book out.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section covers some of the differences between BlitzMax and 'classic' BASIC, and introduces features that help overcome some of classic BASIC's shortcomings.

==Strict mode==

Classic BASIC allows you to declare variables 'on the fly'. For example, consider a program consisting of:

&lt;pre&gt;
For k=1 To 10
sum=sum+k
Next
Print sum
&lt;/pre&gt;

This program automatically creates 2 local variables: 'k' and 'sum'. However, this behaviour can often lead to unexpected bugs. For example, if you mistyped one of the 'sum' variables, the program would not work as expected. No error would be given - a new variable would simply be created.

By default, BlitzMax will allow you to automatically declare variables like this. However, you can use the '''Strict''' command to override this behaviour.

[[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#Strict|Strict]] must appear at the top of your program before any actual program code and puts your program into 'strict mode'. Strict mode forces you to declare all variables before use. For example, rewriting the above program in strict mode results in:

&lt;pre&gt;
Strict
Local sum,k
For k=1 To 10
sum=sum+k
Next
Print sum
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you were to mistype one of the variable names in this program, you would receive an 'identifier not found' error when compiling, allowing you to easily find and correct the problem.

==Arrays==

Blitzmax does not support the Dim statement for array creation. Instead, arrays in BlitzMax are real types - they can be passed to functions, returned from functions and placed in variables.

To create a classic BASIC style array in BlitzMax, use a global variable. For example:

&lt;pre&gt;
Global my_array$[100] 'create a 100 element string array
&lt;/pre&gt;

Also note that arrays in BlitzMax are not '1 bigger' than their dimensioned size - the 100 element array above contains 100 elements, numbered 0 through 99 inclusive.

BlitzMax also does not support a 'Redim' operation. Instead, you can use [[BlitzMax/Language/Slices|slices]]. For example:

&lt;pre&gt;
Global my_array$[100]  'create a 100 element string array
my_array=my_array[..200] 'now a 200 element array!
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Goto and Gosub==

BlitzMax does not support the Gosub command. Use [[BlitzMax/Language/Functions|functions]] instead.

The Goto command is supported, but only in non-strict mode. Goto labels should be prefixed with a # character. For example:

&lt;pre&gt;
For k=1 To 10
a=Rand(10)
If a&lt;5 Then Goto LessThan5
If a&gt;5 Then Goto GreaterThan5
Print &quot;a is equal to 5&quot;
Goto AllDone

#LessThan5
Print &quot;a is less than 5&quot;
Goto AllDone

#GreaterThan5
Print &quot;a is greater than 5&quot;

#AllDone
Next
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Data, Read and Restore==

Data, Read and Restore are supported but have been renamed to [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#DefData|DefData]], [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#ReadData|ReadData]] and [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#RestoreData|RestoreData]]. Data labels must also be prefixed with a # character.

==Object handles==

BlitzMax allows objects to be assigned to integer variables, and integer variables to be passed to functions expecting objects. This is mainly for the benefit of beginners, as it reduces the size and complexity of code, but is also great for lazy pro's! For example:

&lt;pre&gt;
Graphics 640,480
image=LoadImage( &quot;an_image.png&quot; ) 'returned object is converted to an integer handle
DrawImage image,0,0               'integer image parameter is converted back to an object
Flip
WaitKey
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is achieved using an ''object handle'' system, and such handles should be released using the [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#Release|Release]] command when they are no longer needed. For example:

&lt;pre&gt;
Graphics 640,480
image=LoadImage( &quot;an_image.png&quot; ) 'returned object is converted to an integer handle
DrawImage image,0,0               'integer image parameter is converted back to an object
Release image                     'image no longer needed - release it
Flip
WaitKey
&lt;/pre&gt;

Failing to release an object handle will result in memory leaks. However, all objects are released at program exit anyway, so for quick 'n' dirty jobs you don't have to bother.

==Type tag shortcuts==

When declaring variables and function return types, BlitzMax allows you to use BASIC style 'type tags'. These are as follows:

{| cellpadding=&quot;4&quot;
| '''Type tag''' 
| '''Equivalent type'''
|-
| % 
| Int
|-
| # 
| Float
|-
| ~! 
| Double
|-
| ~$ 
| String
|}

For example, a string variable can be declared in two ways:

&lt;pre&gt;
Local a_string:String
Local another_string$
&lt;/pre&gt;

Mac users whose keyboards do not feature the # character should use 'Alt 3'.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Motivation==

You want to create realistically-sized example XML for testing or demonstration.  Lorum impsum text is often used to fill out the contents and it would be useful to add this text wherever needed in an XML file.

We explore two approaches, one based on modifying the text and the other modifying the XML.
== Approach 1 : string replacement ==

The places  in the incomplete XML file where lorum ipsum text is to be placed is marked with ellipsis &quot;...&quot;.  The XML file is read, serialised to a string, split into parts, and the parts re-assembled adding a randomly chosen section of  the lorum ipsum text in place of the ellipsis. The string is then turned back into XML for output. The base lorum ipsum text is stored as an XML file:

http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/apps/lorumipsum/words.xml

=== Concepts used ===
* XML &lt;&gt; string conversion : The script uses a pair of functions from the exist util module (util:serialize and util:parse) to convert back and forth between XML and a string.  This allows the XML text to be operated on as a simple string before being converted back to XML
* recursion : interpolating the random text into the original string requires a recursive function
* regular expressions: reg exps are used to tokenise the lorum ipsum text and the incomplete XML file containing ellipsis

=== XQuery ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:join-random($parts,$words) {
if (count($parts) &gt; 1)
then 
 let $randomtext :=string-join(subsequence ($words,util:random(100), util:random(100)),&quot; &quot;)
 return string-join(($parts[1],$randomtext, local:join-random(subsequence($parts,2), $words)),&quot;&quot;)
else $parts
};

let $lorumipsum := doc(&quot;/db/Wiki/apps/lorumipsum/words.xml&quot;)/lorumipsum
let $words := tokenize($lorumipsum,&quot;\s+&quot;)
let $file := request:get-parameter(&quot;file&quot;,())
let $doc := doc($file)/*
let $docText := util:serialize($doc,&quot;media-type=text/xml method=xml&quot;)
let $parts := tokenize($docText, &quot;\.\.\.&quot;)
let $completedText := local:join-random($parts,$words)
return util:parse($completedText)
&lt;/source&gt;
=== Example ===
* [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Coupland/ex-flat.xml incomplete XML]
* [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/apps/lorumipsum/complete.xq?file=http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Coupland/ex-flat.xml XML with ellipsis replaced with ipsum lorum text]

=== Explanation ===
* the lorum ipsum text is split into words by tokenising on whitespace
* the incomplete XML is fetched and the root element accessed.
* this element is converted to a string using the util:serialize function, then tokenized with the pattern &quot;\.\.\.\&quot; (not &quot;...&quot; since . means any single character in regular expressions) 
* the recursive function join-random() joins the first of a sequence of strings with a random stretch of the lorum ipsum text with the remainder of the strings similarly joined
* the expanded text is converted back to an XML element using util:parse()

=== Improvements ===
* the lorum ipsum text itself could be generated rather than stored.
* the script could be parameterized for the lorum impsum file, allowing different, perhaps more realistic text to be used. 
* the lorum ipsum words are passed as a parameter to the recursive function. This could be defined in a global variable instead.
* It would be better to use the httpclient module to fetch the files and control the caching via headers - here the file is being cached

== Approach 2 - XML replacement ==
The choice of ellipsis as marker is problematic if this is to appear in the text. The conversion into text and back to XML is an overhead.

An alternative approach would be to use an XML element, for example &lt;ipsum/&gt; to mark the places where ipsum lorum text is to appear and replace every occurrance with random word.  The replacement of a specific element anywhere in the XML tree can be accomplished by modifying the identify transformation discussed in [[XQuery/Filtering_Nodes]].

=== Concepts ===
* recursion - to copy an arbitrary XML tree, replacing a given element with random text.

=== XQuery ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare variable $lorumipsum := doc(&quot;/db/Wiki/apps/lorumipsum/words.xml&quot;)/lorumipsum;
declare variable $words := tokenize($lorumipsum,&quot;\s+&quot;);
declare variable $marker:= &quot;ipsum&quot;;

declare function local:copy-with-random($element as element()) as element() {
   element {node-name($element)}
      {$element/@*,
          for $child in $element/node()
          return
               if ($child instance of element())
               then
                  if (name($child) =  $marker)
                  then subsequence($words,util:random(100),util:random(100))
                  else local:copy-with-random($child)
              else $child
      }
};

let $file := request:get-parameter(&quot;file&quot;,())
let $root := doc($file)/*
return
    local:copy-with-random($root)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Explanation ===
* the sequence of ipsum lorum words are held in a global variable to avoid passing it as a parameter to the recursive function.
* The copy-with-random() function recursively copies the elements and items in a tree to a new tree 
* When the element with the name &quot;ipsum&quot; is encountered, a selection of ipsum lorem text is returned instead of the original element.

=== Example ===
* [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Coupland/ex-flat-x.xml incomplete XML]
* [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/apps/lorumipsum/complete2.xq?file=http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Coupland/ex-flat-x.xml XML with ellipsis replaced with ipsum lorum text]

==Discussion==
The second approach is simpler. Performance is about the same.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Creating The Body ==
Open up your Blender, and delete your initial cube by selecting it with the right key and hitting delete. Now select the 'Add' tab top screen, browse to 'Mesh', and then 'UV Sphere', which creates a new sphere at the current cursor position. Change the default number of segments and rings to 16, and select OK. This should create a simple low res sphere, which will be stretched into the body of the fish.
Ensure the sphere is selected, and change to edit mode. Select half of the sphere by pushing 'B', which allows you to drag a square around the elements you want to edit. Select the edges directly in the middle of the sphere, and extrude those edges to create a new face by pushing E, and align it to the axis parallel to the half removed by pushing X. Extrude by approximately 2 'Blends' (the unit of measurement in Blender, which can be seen when you are adjusting them in the bottom left). When you are done, you should have an image similar to this one.

[[File:Fish Body 1.gif|thumb|centre]]

With the edge still selected, extrude this edge by 1 blend, the same way as before, and scale again by 1.2, which should give you an image like this one.

[[File:Fish Body 2.gif|thumb|centre]]

Next to make the last half of the body, extrude again by 1.5, scale by 0.8 (reducing the size of that edge). Extrude by 0.5, scale by 0.7. Finally to finish the main body, extrude again by 0.25, and with the same edges still selected, push space, select edit, then vertices, and select 'merge' and 'at centre', which combines the currently selected edge into one vertice. This should produce the following image.

[[File:Fish Body 3.gif|thumb|centre]]

To make the body into a more fish like ellipse, select the whole model, and scale on the Z axis by 1.25.

[[File:Fish Body 4.gif|thumb|centre]]

== Creating The Tail ==
Reenter object mode, and push space to create a new cube. Reenter edit mode with that cube selected, and create a new set of vertives on the model by selecting all of the cube, pushing space, going to 'Edit'/'Edges'/'Loop Subdivide'. A red line will appear which allows you to select where you want the cuts. Select across from left to right, and push '7' to create 7 cuts.

[[File:Fish Tail 1.gif|thumb|centre]]

Select all of the edges on the right, and move them to the right (by pushing 'G') and move it to the right by 1 blend. Then as above, push space, and select 'Edit'/'Vertices'/'Merge' and then select centre.

[[File:Fish Tail 2.gif|thumb|centre]]

Reduce the size of the tail on the Y axis. Then select evevy other line on the end, and reduce it again.

[[File:Fish Tail 3.gif|thumb|centre]]

To finish it off, we will apply a subsurf modifier. What this will do, for each level that it is applied, will double the number of faces on the image, smoothing the surfaces. By using it, it will create a more smooth and organic model.
First ensure that the editing panel is selected.

[[File:Editing Modes.gif|centre]]

Then select 'Add Modifier' under the modifiers tab, and select 'SubSurf'. By increasing the 'Levels'/'Render Levels' options, the image will be made smoother, with the below image when it is set to two.

[[File:Fish Tail 4.gif|thumb|centre]]

For the sake of this tutorial, always ensure that the 'Render Level' is set to the same rate as the 'Level'. This will ensure that the outputted model in the game will look identical to the model in Blender.

== Fins ==
Using more or less the same techniques, and starting from a cube with a couple more loop cuts, you can easily make the head and side fins.

[[File:Head fin comparision.gif|thumb|centre]]

For the Side fin, create one and duplicate it with Shift-D, move it to the other side, and rotate it by selecting the duplicate and rotate it with R. This should create a pair of fins as below.

[[File:Side fin comparision.gif|thumb|centre]]

== Facial features ==
For the eyes start with a UVsphere, as with the original body, with 24 segments and rings. Duplicate it the same way as above.

[[File:Blender fishy eyes.gif|thumb|centre]]

Finally, for the mouth, create and scale a cube to form a thin rectangle, and place one loop cut in it as below.

[[File:Blender fishy mouth.gif|thumb|centre]]

Finally, place all the pieces together to make up a complete fish.

[[File:Blender Complete fish.gif|thumb|centre]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Daily Encounters with Poetry'''

== The night before: what I can't and won't do ==

=== Decide big questions ===

I can't and I won't decide any of the big questions.

Personally, I don't find a newspaper article poetic just because its author has decided to break it up into lines that look like a poem.  But I'm not going to get into any of that.  If it's poetry to you, great!  If not, move along and don't try to convert me.

Just because the topic &quot;rhyme&quot; appears in this text won't implicate rhyme: just because it rhymes won't mean it's poetry; nor does failure to rhyme preclude it from being poetry.

On any topic, I'll present the basics as they are generally understood, but then will usually dance away from rigid adherence.  Like any religion, poetry's spirit is in the living and the loving, not in dry hollow rules.  Two words may not be in perfect rhyme, yet may be the best pair to be married at the close of a poem that in every other couplet rhymes as perfectly as the strictest professor would demand.  A villanelle that strains against its repetons may best expose the insanity of the cycles in the poet's eye.

Yet I give all due reverence.  A juvenile delinquent who breaks a rule for no better reason than to break the rule does not necessarily improve the poetic justice of the sentence that will be handed down to him in lieu of the one he might better have chosen with more thought.

=== Create a poet ===

I can't and I won't make a poet out of you.

Nor can anybody else, even the most practiced of poets or professors.

Only you have that power.

=== Aid a critic ===

I can't and I won't show you how to analyze a poem.

How to understand a poem.  How to see a poem or hear a poem.  How to get into the poet's head where and when the poem emerged.

I can't make you love poetry, but at least I can't do anything badly enough to make you hate it.  I won't try to influence your tastes for certain poets or styles of poetry.

I would only suggest that one not criticize out of pure ignorance, nor by proxy on the mere word of another.  One need not ever be forced by a parent to taste a single Brussels sprout to know to decline the opportunity; but then one who has been fortunate enough to avoid a Brussels sprout ought not pretend to be the expert on its taste.

If you were to print out this text on suitable paper, the pages might serve as a napkin for your dining on the poetry of other poets.  Past that, it's not intended to serve as a restaurant guide.

=== Dictate the sequence ===

I can't and I won't dictate the sequence.

The ordering of the sections in this text represent a rough approximation of the linear order in which I drafted the material.  As much if not more than could always have been achieved by flipping pages in a book, an electronic text openly allows for reorganizing, skipping around, jumping from link to link.  If you wish to make sure you don't miss any of the good stuff by skipping around, you can even download everything to your own file or transfer this to your own Wikibooks subpage and reorganize any material you've skipped down to some later section for eventual reading.

The rationing out of content day by day is admittedly somewhat arbitrary.  Although a practicing poet ought to never let any period of waking pass without writing down at least one word meant for a poem nor let any period of sleeping pass without dreaming the same, each poet must find her or his own pace.  One might easily spend a year on couplets before moving on, while another might skim through half this text in a single crash cram of an evening.

=== Finish this book ===

I can't and I won't ever finish this book.

That will be your job.

Download the text to your hard drive and change it to say what you would have it say.

Better yet, copy it over to a subpage under your own userpage at Wikibooks, where its text was drafted, and make your own links and add your own examples and change the order all around and republish it.

You'll see these last two suggestions repeated through every section of this book: either build your own file or set of files on your own computer; or else create your own Wikibook subpage or set of subpages.  Like everything else I can and won't do, I can't and won't tell you how to gain the greatest value out of this text.  But I can think of no better way for you to do so than for you to collaborate with me on this exploration through poetry.

== Day 1: Prepare! ==

=== Come back to day 1 every day ===

If you've never written or read a poem outside a school classroom, you may not have a clue how to prepare to write or read a poem.  You may even be unaware how great a difference preparation makes.

Or if you've published dozens of poetry books and read every major and minor poet one might name, your preparations may have become as stale a routine as dragging a brush through your hair upon waking.  Let ritual become too automatic, and you may miss the beauty of a unique twist of hair.

So return to this day and its page every day of your journey through poetry.

=== Exercise 1: Prepare your preparations ===

When I admitted I would never [[#Finish this book|finish this book]], I suggested that you download the text of this book to your own hard drive or copy it over to your own Wikibooks subpage, revising and extending it on your own from there.

If you downloaded this book to your own hard drive, set up a supplemental file for making notes on your own preparations for writing and reading.  If you copied the text over to your own Wikibooks subpage, then set up a new subpage for your notes on preparations.

Then, never stop developing that supplemental file or subpage.  Come back to it every morning as you start a new day of encounter with poetry.  Revisit it every night to reassess how you might have been better prepared.

''[[User:Labombarde/Poetry Prep|Prep]]'' is my own personal Wikibooks subpage on preparations for writing and reading poetry.  If you take this exercise seriously and use Wikibooks for your own version, feel free to add a link to your version here.

== Day 2: Couplet ==

=== Smallest hand: A pair ===

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
     When all began, before there was an earth
     or heaven, just by speaking God gave birth.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A [[w:couplet|couplet]] is a pair of lines of verse.

Frequently the ending words of a couplet rhyme, as in the illustrative couplet given above.  However, rhyming is not necessary for two lines of verse to be considered a couplet, as in the following alternative version of our first couplet.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
     The page was blank before there was an earth
     or heaven, then God filled it up with words.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also, it is common for each line of a couplet to have the same meter, as in both of the preceding examples.  Again, however, matching meter is not necessary for two lines of verse to be considered a couplet, as with the following further version.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
     The page was blank before there existed word, 
     then God wrote.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A couplet may stand alone as a complete poem in and of itself.  Alternatively, a couplet may comprise a distinct element within a larger poem.  For example, an English sonnet closes with a rhyming couplet.  A villanelle is based on a pattern that repeats the two lines of a rhyming couplet throughout the poem.  A triolet is similarly based on repeating lines of a couplet for which the two lines do not rhyme.

Some types of couplets have been given names of their own.  We'll come back around to that [[another day]].  For now, we'll consider one couplet the same as any other.

=== Daily practice ===

Beginners or experts alike, avoid or despise the couplet at your peril!  Even if you never write a stand-alone couplet, an English sonnet, a villanelle or a triolet, or any other poem for which a couplet is an integral part, couplets are as ubiquitous in poetry as weeds that can invade even the deepest concrete of Manhattan.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
     A couplet a day
     tastes like fine chardonnay.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Don't scroll down a screen of this text from one day to a next without writing a new couplet.  Make a new couplet a morning exercise like rolling out of bed to a set of push-ups.

Learn how a couplet can feel like walking, left foot right foot.  Learn how a couplet can feel like breathing, in out in out.  Learn how a couplet can feel like chatting, question followed by response.  Learn how to pull surprise through a couplet where a rhyme suggests one ending that you go ahead and use in an unexpected way or else avoid with a different rhyme or else avoid rhyming altogether.  Learn something about a couplet that you can add to this paragraph in your own version of this text.

=== Exercise 2: Your turn to write couplets ===

Draft a couplet.  Rinse and repeat.  Daily.  Don't ever stop.  The rest of your life, don't let a day go by without drafting a new couplet, unless you follow a skipped day by first catching up for the day you missed.

Write a couplet for every occasion.  Write a couplet for every feeling.  Write a couplet using every possible rhyme.  Write a couplet of every reasonable length.

If you downloaded this book to your own hard drive, set up a supplemental file for drafting couplets and notes about couplets.  If you copied the text over to your own Wikibooks subpage, then set up a new subpage for your couplet exercises.

''[[User:Labombarde/Poetry Couplets|Couplets]]'' is a subpage that will include my own application of this exercise. If you take this exercise seriously and use Wikibooks for your own version, feel free to add a link to your version here.

== Day 3: Write write write ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
     Write.  And write.  Then write.
     Each word will turn out right.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nothing teaches writing as well as writing.  Nothing beats writer's block as decisively as writing.

Write what's left over from your dream when you wake up.  Write your first couplet of the day before you roll out of bed.  Write what you'd rather be doing than what you will be doing instead.  Write how your morning differs from mine.  Write some words that rhyme.  

Always keep paper and a pen nearby.  Even if you type out e-mails on the fly on an electronic device that goes with you everywhere, don't let that replace the feel of the letters and the words flowing from your head through your hand into the pen through the ink onto the paper.  No other feel is quite like it, no other touch quite so inspiring.  Knock out two dozen pages a day electronically, and that one word you scratch out on the 3x5 card sitting at the edge of your bathroom sink - the word that you would have missed and forgotten if you'd shrugged off reaching for your iPhone while brushing your teeth - that word will be the most powerful word of the day.

Other books on writing carry similar advice about keeping paper and pen ready, and it's just as easy to ignore them the same as you'll shrug off this tip.  You'll pay for a writer's workshop and go along with the idea only as long as it's one of the required exercises, still not getting the hint.  Maybe writers should start treating it like a closely guarded secret, not make it seem so obvious, speak in hushed whispers of specially treated paper and magical ink.  One day, you will go back to day 1 and make it part of your daily preparation to have paper and a pen on hand just for your writing, and nothing at all will happen, or so it will seem until years later when you realize you've been writing ever since.  Just do it.

=== Exercise 3: Write ===

Today's exercise is simple: simply do as it says: Write.

If you take this exercise seriously and use Wikibooks for your own version of a daily writing journal, feel free to add a link to your subpage here.

For starters, repeat [[#Exercise 2: Your turn to write couplets|exercise 2]], writing a new couplet for today, working toward developing the habit whereby you will do so without being reminded.  But don't count your couplet toward today's writing exercise.  Write something else, something new, something that isn't aimed toward any particular couplet.

Although much of the content of any of these exercises may be quite rough draft and frequently rther personal, for me the writing contemplated by this exercise crosses the line into privacy that I would rather keep to myself, thus will not yet provide a personal link as I am doing with other exercises in this text until I can segregate out material I wouldn't mind making available.  If you take this exercise seriously and use Wikibooks for your own version of daily journalling for purposes of writing and reading of poetry, feel free to add a link to your version here.

== Day 4: Perfect rhyme ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
     I rhyme with ease,
     if only to please.

     Rhymes can come easy
     without being sleazy

     (although little's easier
     for making it cheesier).
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[w:Perfect rhyme|Perfect rhyme]] is what most people think of most of the time when one refers to &quot;rhyme.&quot;
* Among two or more words, the final consonant sound (if there exists a final consonant sound) is exactly the same and the final vowel sound is exactly the same, as with &quot;ease&quot; perfectly rhyming with &quot;please,&quot; but not with &quot;peace&quot; nor with &quot;ooze.&quot;  If the last two syllables of each word are considered to be rhyming, then the same relationship holds for the next to last syllable: the sounds are identical, as with &quot;easy&quot; perfectly rhyming with &quot;sleazy.&quot;  And although more rare, the same identical relationship would hold for the preceding syllable if the last three syllables of each word are considered to be rhyming, as with &quot;easier&quot; perfectly rhyming with &quot;cheesier.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
* No matter how many syllables are included in the rhyme, the stress on any particular syllable within each word must be the same as in any of the other rhyming words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
* The consonant sound preceding the rhyming syllable or rhyming syllables must be different for the different words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, the words &quot;write&quot; and &quot;right&quot; used in the couplet at the beginning of [[#Day 3: Write write write|day 3's discussion]] are not considered perfect rhymes although they satisfy the other two conditions for perfect rhyming, since both words begin the single rhyming syllable with the &quot;r&quot; sound.  On the other hand, &quot;not write&quot; would be considered a perfect rhyme with &quot;got right&quot; on the basis of the final two syllables of each group of words comprising the rhyme (although composing a sensible poem with that set of words might be a bit of a stretch).

=== Perfecting the perfection ===

Despite the terminology, use these distinctions as a field guide to the nature of one species of sounds, rather than holy scripture regarding the purity of &quot;perfection.&quot;  Just because &quot;writhe&quot; is not a perfect rhyme to &quot;night&quot; doesn't mean it isn't the right word to use for a poem you're writing about how rough your sleep was.  If &quot;writhe&quot; and &quot;night&quot; work, don't bend the line to try saying how writhing seemed so &quot;right&quot; or discolor the nightsweats until they feel &quot;lithe,&quot; merely to stretch for a false sense of rhyme perfection.

But likewise, don't disparage the perfect rhyme as quickly as so many aspiring poets claim to do.  Many are the young writers who turn up their nose at rhyme while grooving to iPods piping in everything from country music to rap, virtually all of which is heavily marinated in perfect rhyme.  And even if you'll listen to lyrics without ever wanting to write a single perfect rhyme, knowledge of perfect rhyme can deepen a writer's awareness of the more common sound sense that no poem can escape.  With &quot;writhe&quot; and &quot;night&quot; recognized as close cousins, it might be a mild stretch to claim that all words distantly rhyme with all others in much the same way as all humans may be distantly related to common ancestry, but the stretch would not be entirely useless to the art of writing and reading a poem.  One who too lightly dismisses perfect rhyme risks missing much of the music within even the most carefully crafted unrhymed free verse.

=== Rhyme dictionaries ===

See [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Rhymes:English Wiktionary's Rhyme Dictionary].

=== Distance yourself to find how close we all are ===

If you're coming to this text with an innate aversion to perfect rhyme, then perhaps the exercise for you would be to find words that have no perfect rhyme within the English language, like &quot;orange&quot; or &quot;silver.&quot;  Those might be the words with which you would then feel most comfortable partying.

And for someone who despises perfect rhyme, almost as fun to be around are the words that may have another word that perfectly rhymes, but that word simply wouldn't fit well in any reasonable poem without badly stretching credibility and sense.  Such words are almost as good as words that have no perfect rhyme, since they tend to be just as lonely.

Start filling out your guest list with those two groups, then start working your way out from there until you get to the most basic rhyming words like &quot;day&quot; and &quot;night.&quot;  Now, for those basic rhyming words that have large families of perfectly rhyming brothers and sisters, make sure you know those siblings well enough to ban their presence at any party in the same room (as in, at the end of a line) as any of their own family.  Do this complete exercise all the way from &quot;silver&quot; to &quot;night,&quot; and you will understand the power of perfect rhyme as perfectly as the best rhymester, even if you never rhyme so much as a single couplet.  And even your most unrhymed lines absent of all alliteration and assonance will show the muscle you will have gained from the exercise.

=== Exercise 4: Keep your own rhyme dictionary ===

Existing rhyming dictionaries are highly recommended, of course, since not even the most learned person knows every single word that rhymes with any given word.  But just as each word has a special meaning and a particular sound and a certain touch to each individual, so too will rhyme connections feel different for you than they do for me.  You'll find that exploring rhymes on your own will carry you far beyond where the strongest winds of the best rhyming dictionary can ever hope to blow.

Again, as has been stressed throughout this text, this will be where electronic media - and Wikibooks in particular - can show its value.  Start a supplemental file or a Wikibook subpage for your own rhyme dictionary; and before long, you'll find yourself thumbing through your own more than through the standard dictionaries (although of course the standard ones should never be completely discarded or ignored).

So let's start your own: list all the words you might use to end the second line in a couplet meant to perfectly rhyme, where the first line ends with the word &quot;bay.&quot;  And unless you have some other couplet that presses in on your day, write today's couplet with ending words that come from that rhyme set.

''[[User:Labombarde/Poetry Rhyme Dictionary|Rhyme Dictionary]]'' will be my Wikibooks subpage where I will be developing my own personal rhyme dictionary as suggested by this exercise.  If you take this exercise seriously and use Wikibooks for your own version of a rhyming dictionary, feel free to add a link to your subpage here.

== Day 5: Read read read ==

Never stop reading!  And don't limit your reading!

I've scarcely gone a day the past 50 years without reading something.  And most of those days, part of that something would be a poem or a book about poems or poets.  But for too many of those years, I was too cautious about my reading, wary of being &quot;influenced&quot; too much in any one direction.  If I had those five decades to read all over again, I would read ten times as much and with no restraint whatsoever.  One can never be influenced enough, nor can one suffer permanent damage from such influence.

Even if the muse fills your entire day with words of your own, stretch the day an hour longer if need be to fill it even further with words written by other poets.

=== Exercise 5: Keep a poetry reading journal ===

''[[User:Labombarde/Poetry Reading Journal|Poetry Reading Journal]]'' will be my Wikibooks subpage where I will be keeping notes on poems I am reading, as suggested by this exercise.  If you take this exercise seriously and use Wikibooks for your own version of a poetry reading journal, feel free to add a link to your subpage here.

If every day you are seriously repeating every exercise from every preceding day, then by today you should already be nearing the point where you'll be encountering the question of how serious you intend to be about writing and reading poetry.  We're still only dabbling with the simplest basics - preparing, reading, jotting down notes, collecting rhymes, and scribbling out couplets - yet already these exercises taken seriously should occupy an hour or more of concentrated effort during the day, not to mention invading our thoughts throughout the entire day.  Will it relax back down to a casual hobby for you from here on out?  Or will you have to start a triage order for all remaining tasks? and will poetry take hold and never for a single day consume any less of your existence than it does now?

== Day 6: Humble iamb ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
     An iamb's not an iamb (at least, not
     in English, in which this text will be taught).
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Day 7: Listen to poetry ==

As we discussed several days ago, perfect rhyme is characterized by the ''sound'' of words.  And for all but a few very rare exceptions, the sounds of words is important even to poems that don't rely on perfect rhyme.  Yet even for students or practitioners of poetry, too often a poem is experienced only by silently reading the words printed on a page or displayed on a screen.

Poems are meant to be heard!

Get in the habit of listening to poetry read aloud.

== Day 8: Perfect rhyme types ==

== Day 9: Transcribe ==

== Day x: Revise revise revise ==

== Day x: Join a local poetry group ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
In the beginning, God
gave his first draft the nod.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

God can be perfect enough to get it right the first time.  We should rarely allow ourselves the arrogance to think it anything but an accident if we can do the same.

==== Words words words ====

==== Rhyme ====

''[[w:Rhyme|Rhyme]]'' generally refers to an implicit relationship between two or more words based on the similarity of sounds among those words.  One word is said to &quot;rhyme&quot; with another if the one word sounds similar to the other.
* See also &quot;[[#Eye rhyme|eye rhyme]],&quot; based on the appearance of each word as spelled out, as contrasted with the general sense of rhyme based on the sound of each word.
* &quot;Rhyme&quot; may also refer to a set of lines or a poem that employs rhyme.  In this text, except as otherwise obvious from context (for example, in reference to a &quot;nursery rhyme&quot;), &quot;rhyme&quot; will be taken as meant in the sense stated above, that is, in the relationship of similar sounds between words).
* Except as otherwise specifically addressed, rhyme is discussed in this text in the context of common English.  It has been generally taken as given that rhyme is more restricted in English than for numerous other languages.  Thus, for example, such relative restriction of rhyme is often cited as a major influence leading to emergence of the English sonnet form, which is slightly more relaxed in its rhyming demands than the earlier Petrarchan sonnet form.

'''Marcion RC3'''

'''Marcion''' is [[wikipedia:en:Coptic_language|Coptic]] - English/Czech dictionary related to Crum's Coptic dictionary, written in [[wikipedia:en:c++|C++]], based on [[wikipedia:en:mysql|MySql]], with [[wikipedia:en:Qt_(framework)|Qt4]] GUI. Contains many Coptic texts, grammars, greek texts, Liddel-Scott Greek-English lexicon, and others. Can be used as a bible study tool.

[[File:Hypostasis.png|right|thumb|240px|The Hypostasis Of The Archons, NHC II/4, 86:27-87:4]]
== Installation and startup ==

More useful is to install all fonts from folder 'fonts' into your OS and turn off switch '''load internal fonts at startup''' in form '''settings''' (''Main menu: '''application-&gt;settings ''' ''). Fonts ''SP Tiberian'' and ''SP Achmim'' are used due grammar of [[J.M. Plumley]]

=== [[wikipedia:en:Linux|Linux]] ===
Prerequisities:
*Qt &gt;= 4.6.0
*djvulibre &gt;=3.5.22
Download 'marcion_rc3-linux-x86.tar.bz2' and unpack it. Run executable 'marcion' in main directory. If output of '''ldconfig -p''' not contains important Qt libraries ''(for example if Qt is installed in /opt)'', edit /etc/ld.so.conf and execute '''ldconfig''', or execute ''marcion'' with LD_LIBRARY_PATH .

''for example:''
 bash$&gt; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/qtsdk-2009.05/qt/lib/ ./marcion

=== Windows ===

Download 'marcion_rc3-win32.zip'. Unpack it and run ''marcion.exe''

== Building from sources ==

=== Tarball ===
 
Prerequisities:

these packages are necessary, headers and libraries:

* [[wikipedia:en:Qt_(framework)|qt4]] &gt;= 4.6.0
* [[wikipedia:en:DjVu|djvulibre]] &gt;= 3.5.21
* [[wikipedia:en:mysql|mysql]] = 5.1.41
* [[wikipedia:en:bzip2|libbzip2]] &gt;= 1.0.5
* [[wikipedia:en:Glibc|glibc]] &gt;= 2.9

you must have installed build tool
* [[wikipedia:en:scons|scons]] &gt;= 1.2.0

If you are using binary packages presented in your distro, ensure, that you have also installed “devel” packages with headers.

Download source package and unpack it. Navigate into directory 'marcion-src' and run scons with these parameters:

; qt4lib : default value &quot;/usr/lib/&quot;
; qt4inc : default value &quot;/usr/lib/qt4/include/&quot;
; djvulibrelib : default value &quot;/usr/lib/&quot;
; djvulibreinc : default value &quot;/usr/include/&quot;
; mysqllib : default value &quot;/usr/local/mysql/lib/&quot;
; mysqlinc : default value &quot;/usr/local/mysql/include/&quot;
; bzip2lib : default value &quot;/usr/lib/&quot;
; bzip2inc : default value &quot;/usr/include/&quot;
; glibclib : default value &quot;/usr/lib/&quot;
; glibcinc : default value &quot;/usr/include/&quot;
; install : no value
; installdir : default value &quot;/opt/marcion/&quot;

Assign to each variable correct value. You can also edit file 'SConstruct' and into command beginning with 'd=env.ParseFlags' insert additional flags for compiler.

''example:'' If you have Qt installed in '/opt', GlibC and bzip2 in '/usr', MySql in '/opt/mysql' and DjVuLibre in '/home/user/software' and you want to have Marcion installed into '/home/user/software/marcion', do this:
 bash $&gt; tar -xjf marcion_rc3-src.tar.bz2
 bash $&gt; cd marcion-src
 bash $&gt; scons qt4lib=/opt/qt4/lib qt4inc=/opt/qt4/include \
         djvulibrelib=/home/user/software/djvulibre/lib \
         djvulibreinc=/home/user/software/djvulibre/include \
         mysqllib=/opt/mysql/lib mysqlinc=/opt/mysql/include \
         install installdir=/home/user/software/marcion

=== [[wikipedia:en:Subversion_(software)|SVN]] ===
 
Prerequisities:

these packages are necessary, headers and libraries:

* qt4 &gt;= 4.5
* djvulibre &gt;= 3.5.21
* mysql = 5.1.41
* libbzip2 &gt;= 1.0.5
* glibc &gt;= 2.9

you must have installed build tool
* [[wikipedia:en:CMake|cmake]] &gt;= 2.8

If you are using binary packages presented in your distro, ensure, that you have also installed “devel” packages with headers.

Checkout source tree from [[wikipedia:en:Subversion_(software)|svn]] repository

 bash $&gt; svn co https://marcion.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/marcion marcion

Download proper gzipped mysql [[wikipedia:en:Tar_(file_format)|tar]] binary archive for your platform into directory 'depends' and unpack it. Create symlink 'mysql' pointed to 'mysql*' directory. (Tested on version 5.1.41, but newer versions should work also. If you have installed mysql in your OS already, you can use variables '''M_EXTRA_MYSQL_INC''' and '''M_EXTRA_MYSQL_LIB''') Download data from project page, directory 'devel' file 'mdata.tar.bz2' into directory 'depends' and unpack it. (If you have marcion installed already and you want use data from it, use variable '''M_MARCION_DATA''')

''example:''
 bash $&gt; cd &lt;root-of-marcion&gt;/depends
 bash $&gt; wget http://downloads.mysql.com/archives/mysql-5.1/mysql-5.1.41-linux-i686-glibc23.tar.gz
 bash $&gt; tar -xzf mysql-5.1.41-linux-i686-glibc23.tar.gz
 bash $&gt; ln -sv mysql-5.1.41-linux-i686-glibc23/ mysql
 bash $&gt; wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/marcion/files/devel/mdata.tar.bz2/download
 bash $&gt; tar -xjf mdata.tar.bz2

Run ''cmake'' with these parameters:

; M_EXTRA_DJVULIBRE_INC : default value &quot;&quot;
; M_EXTRA_DJVULIBRE_LIB : default value &quot;&quot;
; M_EXTRA_MYSQL_INC : default value &quot;depends/mysql/include&quot;
; M_EXTRA_MYSQL_LIB : defaultní value &quot;depends/mysql/lib&quot;
; QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE : default value &quot;&quot;
; M_MARCION_DATA : default value &quot;depends/mdata&quot;
; CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX : default value &quot;$HOME/MarcionRC3svn&quot;

''examples:''

If you have all packages installed in obvious system places and you wish to have installed ''marcion'' in '$HOME/MarcionRC3svn', execute

 bash $&gt; cmake ..

If you wish to install ''marcion'' into different place, for example '/home/user/marc-svn', use variable '''CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX'''

 bash $&gt; cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/user/software/marc-svn ..

If you have Qt installed in '/opt', GlibC and bzip2 in '/usr', MySql in '/opt/mysql' and DjVuLibre in '/home/user/software' and you want to have Marcion installed into '/home/user/software/marcion', do this:

 bash $&gt; cmake -DM_EXTRA_DJVULIBRE_INC=/home/user/software/djvulibre/include \
         -DM_EXTRA_DJVULIBRE_LIB=/home/user/software/djvulibre/lib \
         -DM_EXTRA_MYSQL_INC=/opt/mysql/include \
         -DM_EXTRA_MYSQL_LIB=/opt/mysql/lib \
         -DM_MARCION_DATA=/home/user/software/marcion \
         -DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE=/opt/qt/bin/qmake \
         -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/user/software/marcion ..

or alternatively execute cmake in interactive mode and set values in prompt line

 bash $&gt; cmake -i ..

After succesful configuration execute:

 bash $&gt; make
 bash $&gt; make install

''notes:''

Parameter -L shows you current content of all variables in cache.

''(fonts '''New Athena Unicode''' and '''Ezra SIL''' are needed)''
=== Dictionaries ===
==== Coptic ([[Crum]]) ====
===== printed (djvu) =====
[[File:Crum.png|right|thumb|100px|Crum]]
''Main menu: '''action-&gt;crum (coptic)''' ''

Dictionary is viewed by DjView component, so you can use all features of this browser. On the top panel is editable combobox containing letters for navigation through dictionary. You must select char(s) from list or insert two chars (one char + space). Chars can be latin or coptic ([[#greek and coptic|table]]).

===== text (mysql) =====
[[File:Crumquery.png|right|thumb|100px|Crum (query)]]
[[File:Crumquery2.png|right|thumb|100px|Crum (query)]]
[[File:Crumquery3.png|right|thumb|100px|Crum (query)]]

''Hlavní menu: '''action-&gt;crum-query(coptic)''' ''

Shows window with GUI for searching words in Crum's dictionary. Database is still under construction, for now contains 3350 words, 4837 derivations and over 48 000 indexed items.

Data import:

Content of dictionary is possible to backup into ''.csv'' (2 files) or ''.sql'' file.''(Main menu: '''database-&gt;local-&gt;export coptic tables-&gt;csv, database-&gt;local-&gt;export coptic tables-&gt;sql''')''

Data export:

''Main menu: '''database-&gt;local-&gt;import data''' ''

Only for ''.sql'' files. Upgrades of database are placed in project page in folder '' 'extras/crum-data' ''. After successful import rebuild index.''(Main menu: '''database-&gt;local-&gt;(re)create index of coptic tables''')''.

GUI comtains these components:

* numeric fields (limit of output)
* switch
::; ''direct'' : search word directly
::; ''index'' : search word through index
* checkboxes
::; ''show czech'' : (don't) show czech
::; ''greek equivs'' : (don't) show greek
::; ''show derivations'' : (don't) derivations
* tabs
::; ''coptic'' : search for coptic word
:::; ''exact'' : exact match
:::; ''like'' : '%' stands for any group of chars (including empty) and '_' stand for exactly one char. ([http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/string-comparison-functions.html#operator_like| official documentation])
:::; ''regexp'' : match regexp [[w:regular expression|regular expression]] ([http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/regexp.html#operator_regexp| official documentation])
::; ''dialects'' : filter by dialect
::; ''czech/english'' : fulltext search of czech/english text
::; ''greek'' : fulltext search of greek text
::; ''crum'' : shows words by pages
* toolbar with output components
::; ''tree'' : complete view
::; ''show'' : navigates to word
::; ''show all in tree'' : complete view of entire result
* outpit text area

There are two ways how to search in dictionary - directly or through index.

====== direct search (obsolete) ======

You can use latin and coptic script, mixed also. If option '''exact''' is enabled, then ''non-word'' chars and spaces are removed after query. Spaces are always ignored. After query inpu text is converted into latin.

Looks only for complete word, like ⲛⲟⲃⲉ, ⲛⲁⲃⲉ, ⲛⲟⲃⲓ - not ⲣ.ⲛⲟⲃⲉ, ⲣ.ⲛⲁⲃⲉ, ⲉⲣ.ⲛⲟⲃⲓ, ⲣⲉϥ.ⲣ.ⲛⲟⲃⲉ etc.

====== through index (recommended) ======
Index contains whole words and their combinations with various kinds of words - so you can search for words like ⲁⲧ.ⲣⲱⲙⲉ, ⲙⲛⲧ.ⲁⲧ.ⲧⲁⲕⲟ, ϯ.ⲡⲁϩⲣⲉ, ⲉⲓ ⲉⲃⲟⲗ, ⲣⲙ.ⲛ.ϩⲏⲧ etc. After import of data of dictionary ''(files &quot;crumX-Y.sql.bz2&quot;)'' and after manual editation is important to rebuild index ''(Main menu:''' database-&gt;local-&gt;(re)create index of coptic tables''')''. Function '''resolve''' of popup menu of toolbox '''tree''' shows how index is builded.

==== Greek ([[wikipedia:en:Greek-English_Lexicon|LSJ]]) ====
[[File:Lsj.png|right|thumb|100px|LSJ]]

*tabs
::; ''search in dictionary'' : base morph
::; ''parse inflection'' : indicates word class and morph
*options
::; ''switch tr'' : (don't) convert
::; ''exact'' : exact match
::; ''regexp'' : matches [[wikipedia:en:regular expression | regular expression]] ([http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/regexp.html#operator_regexp| official documentation])

Compared is text of output field (converted text).

=== Library ===
[[File:Library.png|right|thumb|100px|library]]

Hierarchy of items of library is ordered in four levels:
*script
*language
*collection
*book
Only collections can be added or removed.


==== maintaining ====
===== add collection =====

''Main menu: '''library-&gt;import collection''' případně '''database-&gt;local-&gt;import data''' ''

Files with collections (''.sql'' or compressed ''.sql.bz2'') are stored in folder 'data/backup' and on page of project in folder 'texts'.

===== create index =====
''popup menu of library component: '''index-&gt;create index''' '' 

Collection can be searchable only if index of it is builded. Informations about state of collections shows ''popup menu of library component: '''index-&gt;show''' ''.

===== remove collection =====

''popup menu of library component: '''delete''' a '''delete all''' ''

If collection is deleted, is deleted its index also.

==== searching ====
[[File:Libsearch.png|right|thumb|100px|library - search]]

''Main menu: '''library-&gt;search library''' ''

components of panel:

:; ''list of scripts'' : choose script
:; ''list of languages'' : choose language
:; ''list of collections'' : collections written in chosen language
*tabs
::; ''simple'' : search for one word/phrase
::; ''extended'' : using of logical operators
*switch
::; ''word'' : search for word
::; ''phrase'' : search for phrase
:; ''numeric fields'' : limits of output
*button '''query'''

In lists choose language, script and check collections in which will be searched. If collection have no index, then is inactive and cannot be checked.

Types of index:
; ''simple'' : indexed are all words of verse and entire verse
; ''extended'' : indexed are all words of verse, entire verse, entire next verse and combination of last word of first verse with first word of second verse

Items of index are small letters without diacritic.
Is possible to search word or phrase in extension of one verse, matched is always [[wikipedia:en:regular expression | regular expression]] case insensitive without diacritic.

''tab simple:''
Search for only one word or one phrase.

''tab extended:''
logical operators

''examples:''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==

Techniques in organic chemistry applied to biology can produce many accommodations such as medicines that are useful to everyone. Methods of separating, isolating, purifying, and identifying unknown compounds as well as known compounds in unknown mixtures are helpful to the pharmaceutical industry. By isolating and purifying an unknown compound and then performing other analyses such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/NMR Spectroscopy|NMR]] or [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Cryo-Electron Microscopy|electron microscopy]], the structure of the compound can be identified and with further analyses of the structure, its biological implications and effects can be understood using chemistry. Ever since the extraction of morphine from opium, many natural products have been isolated and their structures determined. Once the structure was determined, chemists were able to devise synthetic methods to synthesis these compounds, creating modern pharmaceutical chemistry. One example of this is Caffeine. By isolating, purifying, and identifying its structure, scientists have been able to understand how the consumption of caffeine results in wakefulness and alertness. These biological effects are the results of its structural similarity to adenosine and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This similarity allows caffeine to bind to the active site of receptors or enzymes that normally react with adenosine and its derivatives. Adenosine is important in the regulation of brain activity as build up of adenosine levels in the brain during the day causes the concentration to increase and if it is high enough, adenosine binds to brain receptors that activates mechanisms causing drowsiness and sleep. When caffeine binds to the adenosine receptors, it prevents the binding of adenosine and therefore delays sleepiness and increases alertness. Also, Caffeine inhibits the enzyme cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (cAMP-PDE) that converts cAMP to noncyclic monophospate. cAMP is a secondary messenger responsible for increasing blood pressure and delivering more oxygen to the brain. When caffeine binds to cAMP-PDE, it stops the breakdown of cAMP and consequently prolongs the excitation effects. In conclusion, the use of organic chemistry techniques to isolate, purify, identify, and understand compound structures can lead to a chemical understanding of the biological phenomenon that result for chemical interactions which forms the basis for biochemistry.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Liquid-Liquid Extraction ==
[[File:Liquid liquid extraction.png|thumb|Liquid-liquid Extraction]]
	Extraction is a technique used for separating a compound from a mixture. An example is separating a water-insoluble organic compound from an aqueous mixture by extracting it into a water-insoluble organic solvent. These extractions are often part of the workup procedure for isolating and purifying the product of an organic reaction. Because trace amounts of water are often present at the end of an extraction process, a drying reagent is needed to ensure a dry product. The process of liquid-liquid extraction involves the distribution of a compound between two solvents that are insoluble in each other. By taking advantage of the differing solubilities of a solute in a pair of solvents, compounds can be selectively transported from one liquid phase to the other.

This occurrence is quantified by the partition coefficient (K):
:&lt;math&gt;  \text{ K} = \frac{\text{ Concentration of solute in organic phase}}{\text{ Concentration of solute in aqueousphase}}.&lt;/math&gt;
The larger the value of K, the solute will be found in greater amounts in the organic solvent.
In an extraction procedure, an aqueous phase, usually water, and a immiscible organic solvent known as the organic phase are generally shaken in a container. The solutes are then allowed to distribute themselves between the two layers according to their solubility, the denser layer is always on the bottom of the container. After they have distributed themselves, each layer can be removed and analyzed separately by drying the extractions. The factors that need to be considered in selecting a drying agent are its capacity for removing water, its efficiency, the speed with which it works, and its chemical inertness. Once the extraction has been dried, the solvent must be removed to recover the desired organic product. This can be achieved by heating the container of the mixture and allowing for the solvent to evaporate, leaving a solid or liquid residue or allowing the mixture in to evaporate in a fume hood, depending on the volatility of the solvent.

==Liquid-Liquid Extraction FlowChart==

Here is an example of a simple liquid-liquid extraction problem.
[[File:Liquid extraction111.png]]

You want to isolate a mixture of compounds, and you do this by taking advantage of the bascicity and acidity of certain compounds. It is also important to note those structures that are rather neutral. Some key concepts are, bases will react with acid and vice versa. Also, the aqueous layer will contain a charged molecule, or ion, most of the time.

'''Step 1:''' Upon dissolving the mixture in a good solvent such as methylene chloride, a strong acid is added to the mixture. 

The strong acid is added so that it will react with any basic compounds in the mixture, which wil lead it into the aqueous layer. Thus, one of the compounds has been separated. Adding base will deprotonate the proton from the nitrogen and give you the isolated product in the organic layer.

'''Step 2:''' To the remaining 3 compounds, a weak base is added, such as sodium carbonate. 

The weak base will deprotonate the most acidic of the hydrogens, which is in this case, the carboxylic acid. The carboxylic acid containing structuer will be separated into the aqueous layer. Keep in mind, that the base is not limited to only deprotonating one structure, but this all just depends on the acidity of the compounds.

'''Step 3:''' To the final 2 compounds, a stronger base such as potassium hydroxide which will deprotonate the phenol. 

Generally phenols are not very acidic, that is why a strong base must be used. The cyano containing compound is left in the organic layer.

&lt;u&gt;'''Reaction Complete.'''&lt;/u&gt; All 4 compounds have been isolated into either aqueous or organic, and as mentioned eariler, it is very easy to bring an aqueous compound back into the organic, that is by adding the complementary acid or base.

== Column Chromatography ==
[[Image:Chromatography column.PNG‎|thumbnail|Column Chromatography]]
Column chromatography is a preparative method for separating and isolating compounds from mixtures which can later be analyzed using [[Structural Biochemistry/Chromatography/Thin Layer|thin-layer chromatography]] (TLC), gas chromatography, or IR. The method is used for obtaining compounds from natural sources or for purifying products from reaction mixtures. This method can be considered an upside-down version of TLC. Instead of having a thin layer of adsorbent attached to a solid support, a column is filled with a larger amount of adsorbent, often silica gel, and the mixture is loaded on top of it. While TLC depends on capillary action, column chromatography depends on a solvent or eluent moving down the column using the force of gravity. As this eluent moves down the column, it carries the soluble compounds with it and compounds having strong interactions with the adsorbent move more slowly than compounds having weaker interactions with the adsorbent. By taking advantage of the material used for the stationary and mobile phase, the compounds will separate in distinctive bands and each band will come out of the column individually. This will allow for the collection of each separate band in different vials which can then be analyzed with TLC and then dried to later be analyzed based on their melting points. 

Polarity plays a large role in the process, where the using a non-polar solvent allows for a non-polar substance to be collected first before the more polar components. As the polarity of the solvents increase, more polar compounds travel further faster. This is why it is important for the solvents used to slowly change in polarity throughout the column chromatography procedure for better separation.&lt;ref name=&quot;column chromatography&quot;&gt;[Mohrig, Jerry R. &quot;Techniques in Organic Chemistry.&quot; 2010, W.H. Freeman and Company]

== Distillation ==
One form of distillation is fractional distillation which is a simple technique for accomplishing a large number of distillation/separations, in a single continuous process. A fractional distillation column has an extensive surface area for exchange of heat between ascending vapor and descending liquid. As the condensate accepts heat from the vapor at any point in the column, the condensate is partially vaporized and the vapor is enriched in the more volatile component. At the same time, as the vapor loses heat to the condensate, part of the vapor condenses and the condensate becomes enriched in the less volatile component, returning back to the bottom of the flask. Eventually, the vapor that condenses at the top of the column is pure or enriched in the more pure, volatile component where as the condensate that has returned to the flask contains the pure and enriched less volatile component. The ability to separate these two liquids highly depends on the differences in the boiling points of the two liquids as well as other factors such as rate of distillation, insulation of the column, and the efficiency in the column. In order to achieve good separation, an even heating and low rate of distillation must be applied and maintained as much as possible, creating a high reflux ratio. The type of column also plays an important role as the process of packing the column and the material used all determine the efficiency and ability that a column has for separating the components of a liquid mixture. After the fractions have been collected, TLC can be used to determine the purity of each fraction. After spotting each fraction on a TLC plate and then developing them with a solvent, the presence of one spot in a lane is representative of a pure fraction whereas multiple spots indicate the presence of other compounds in the mixture. After isolating the pure fractions, they can then be evaporated and the pure substances analyzed.

== Solid phase Extraction ==
     Solid phase extraction is a separation process  by which compounds that are dissolved in a liquid mixture can be separated from other compounds by use of a stationary phase. This separation technique is different than the others in the sense that the compound is not lifted from a solution by varying polarity by means of a solvent, but instead, the adhesion to a stationary phase. 
     The technique works on the basis of two phases, the mobile phase and the stationary phase. The mobile phase, or the “moving phase”, is the solvent that pushes the mixture of analysis through a stationary phase. Through means of intermolecular interactions, the various components in the mixture will rapidly bind back and forth between the mobile phase and stationary phase while the mobile phase travels up the stationary phase by capillary action. Depending on the type of compound and the interaction it has between the mobile and stationary phase, each compound will display different affinities between the respective phases and demonstrate a different adsorption pattern along the stationary phase. 
	The stationary phase used most lab settings is amorphous silica gel which contains a high hydrophilic surface. Mobile phases used, examples being eythl acetate, petroleum ether and methyl tertiary butyl ether, possess different polar characteristics that allow for differential “climbing” patterns for varying compounds on a stationary phase. The combination of capillary action and surface tension allow for the mobile phase to travel up the stationary phase and provide for seperation of mixtures based on whether the compound of interest would show interaction with the stationary phase or not. As the mobile phase “picks up” the mixture of compounds up the stationary phase, compounds that exhibit a stronger intermolecular interaction will spend more time binding to the stationary phase, traveling a shorter distance and vice versa. It is this differential interaction with the stationary phase that associates a Retardation factor with each compound. The retardation factor is defined as the ratio of the distance a compound travels to mobile phase front. Compounds with a lower retardation factor exhibit a stronger interaction with the stationary phase while compounds with a higher retardation factor exhibits a weaker interaction with the stationary phase.

[[Image:Recrystallization_technique.jpg‎|250px|thumb|right|'''&lt;center&gt;Summary of Recrystallization&lt;/center&gt;]]
Recrystallization is the process of purification that involves dissolution of a solid in a hot solvent, filtration of the heated solution or mixture, crystal formation, and the isolation of the crystalline compound. In order to perform a recrystallization, the solubility of a compound in a hot solvent must be taken advantage of. A saturated solution at a higher temperature normally contains more solute than the same solute/solvent pair at a lower temperature; as a result, the solute precipitates when a warm saturation solution cools. In other words, a solution at a higher temperature will have more dissolved solids and as it cools, the solute will return back to its solid phase, forming a precipitate. Impurities in the solid being recrystallized are usually significantly lower in concentration than the concentration of the substance being purified so as the mixture cools, the impurities remain in solution while the highly concentrated product crystallizes. 

Crystal formation of a solute from a solution is a selective process because only solids moving at the right speed and are under the appropriate conditions of concentration and solvent form almost perfect crystalline materials as only molecules of with the right shape fit into the crystal lattice. Recrystallization purifies a compound because dissolution of the impure solid in a suitable hot solvent destroys the crystal lattice of the impure compound and the recrystallization from the cold solvent selectively produces a new, more pure crystal lattice. Slow cooling of the saturated solution promotes formation of pure crystals because the molecules of the impurities that don’t fit too well have time to return to the solution. Crystals that form slowly are larger(not always) and often purer than ones that form quickly because rapid crystal formation traps impurities within the lattice as they are simply surrounded by the crystallizing solute. The most important aspect of recrystallization is the choice of solvent because the solute should have maximum solubility in the hot solvent and minimum solubility in the cold solvent. The relationship of solute and solvent can be best described as “like dissolves like”. This entails that nonionic compounds generally dissolve in water only when they can associate with the water molecules through hydrogen bonding. Hydrocarbons and alkyl halides are virtually insoluble in water whereas carboxylic acids and alcohols are often recrystallize from water solutions. In a miniscale recrystallization experiment several steps are followed to complete the purification process.

#The solid to be recrystallized must first be weighed and then dissolved in an appropriate hot solvent. 
#The solid impurities must be filtered using a gravity filtration process.
#The hot recrystallization mixture is then set aside to cool to room temperature.
#After cooling to room temperature, the solution is then cooled even further by placing it in an ice-water bath for 10-15 minutes to allow further recrystallization. 
#To collect the crystals and to complete the recrystallization, the crystals must be collected by vacuum filtration.

==An easy depiction of the recrystallization process==
One of the key factors of purification through recrystallization is understanding solubility. In order to proceed with a successful recrystallization process, the mixture must have some important solubility properties. One solvent must be soluble at all temperatures. The next solvent must be soluble at low temperatures. And another solvent must be soluble at high temps, and insoluble at low temps.

[[File:RecrystallizationGraphCpre.png]]

Here is a simple illustration which explains how the purification process is conducted.

The blue square is soluble at all temperatures, The orange circle is mostly insoluble at all temperatures, and the green triangle is soluble at high temperatures and insoluble at low temperatures. 

#1. Add  heat: If we heat up the mixture containing the square, circle, and triangle, the triangle will already be in solution, and we can heat it to the point that the green triangle dissolves. Then we are left with only the insoluble circle.

#2. Filter: We can then filter the aqueous dissolved solution and once we separate this we are left with only the triangle and square in solution while the circle was left in the previous vessel. 

#3. Cool Down: When the newly isolated mixture is cooled, the triangle will begin to crystallize again since it is insoluble at low temperatures, but the square will remain in solution since it is soluble at all temperatures.

#4. We separate the aqueous layer(the triangle) and we are left with our compound of interest, the triangle.

==Isoelectric Focusing==
[[File:IEF.jpg|360x480px|thumbnail|The Process of Isoelectric Focusing]]
'''Isoelectric Focusing''' is an electrophoresis protein purification process in which proteins are separated by their isoelectric points.  The '''isoelectric point''' of a protein, the '''pI''', is the characteristic pH at which a protein carries no net charge.  The net charge of a protein is determined by the acidity or basicity of the side chains that make up the protein.  If a protein has more acidic groups than basic groups then the protein will have a very low pH and be considered acidic.  If the protein has more basic groups in its side chains than acidic groups then the overall charge of the protein will cause its pH to be much higher.  Isoelectric focusing takes advantage of these properties with the following steps:

#Create a gel that has a linear pH gradient within it 
#Insert the protein samples into the gel
#Apply an electric field with an anode (+) at one end and a cathode (-) at the other
#Allow time for the proteins to migrate toward their neutral pI according to their net charge

The linear pH of the gel allows for the samples to be added arbitrarily because the pH of the environment combined with the electric field will force the movement of the protein regardless of their initial positions within the gel.  The proteins do not begin to migrate until the electric field is applied.  Upon application of the electric field, the proteins move toward the terminal with the charge opposite them gathering or releasing protons throughout migration until they have reached their neutral, isoelectric point.  For example, assume all the protein samples have been applied at the neutral pH location of the gradient where pH=7.  When the field has finally been applied the proteins will migrate according to their net charge.  If the protein has an isoelectric point of 2 then at the pH of 7, the protein has less hydrogen ions than it needs in order to be neutral, i.e. reach its isoelectric point.  This deems the protein as negative and thus it will move toward the anode (+) picking up protons as it travels through the gradient to a lower pH.  When the protein has finally gathered enough protons to make it neutral, the protein will no longer have a net charge and cease its migration at its isoelectric point.  

Isoelectric Focusing allows for protein purification based on a different protein characteristic, pI.  Therefore proteins with similar characteristics such a molecular weight can be purified and separated via their distinct pI's in rather short periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, A.T. (1986).

[[Image:Sublimation.jpg|180px|thumb|right|'''&lt;center&gt;Sublimation apparatus&lt;/center&gt;]]
		Sublimation is the process in which a substance changes directly from a solid to the gas phase without forming an intermediate liquid phase. One example of this is dry ice, which is converted from the solid form of carbon dioxide directly into carbon dioxide gas. In the laboratory, sublimation can be used to purify an organic compound only after meeting four requirements. 
#The compound must vaporize without melting
#It must be stable enough to vaporize without decomposing
#The vapors of the compound must be able to condense back to the solid
#Impurities within the compound do not also sublime.
The apparatus for sublimation consists of an outer vessel and an inner vessel.
The outer vessel holds the sample to be purified connected to a vacuum. The inner container known as a cold finger provides a cold surface on which the vaporized compound can recondense as a solid. To perform sublimation, the sample to be sublimed must be placed into a filter flask. Next, an inner tube is placed in the flask and the vacuum is turned on. Afterwards, the sublimation flask is heated gently, using a sand bath, as ice is filled in the inner tube. During sublimation, material will disappear from the bottom of the outer vessel and then reappear on the cool, outside surface of the inner test tube. This is the result of the compound vaporizing as it reaches its sublimation temperature and then recondensing on the cold finger as a result of cooling. After completion, the inner test tube can be removed and the pure solid can be scraped off and analyzed. 

It is important to note the distance between the impure compound and the cold finger during sublimation. The components of the sublimation set up need to be close enough to avoid decomposition yet far enough that contamination doesn’t take place. A large distance means that the temperature applied must be very high to keep the compound in the vapor form, which could cause the compound to decompose. A small distance could cause the impurities to easily come into contact with the purified compound on the cold finger. The purification could be ineffective if the distance is not taken into consideration. &lt;ref name=&quot;sublimation&quot;&gt;Mohrig, Jerry R. &quot;Techniques in Organic Chemistry.&quot; 2010, W.H.

== Distillation ==
Distillation is used to separate a two-component mixture and Gas Chromatography is used to identify the constituent compounds. Distillation is a technique that separates compounds based on their vapor pressures and boiling points. When two different compounds are heated, one may boil at a lower temperature than the other. By separating the vapors of the compound with the lower boiling point from the other, one may separate the vapor from the liquid and re-condense it, effectively separating the two. With successive distillations, a high degree of purification is possible. Distillations carried out one a time are called simple distillations. Although high efficiency can be achieved through multiple simple distillations, it would be tedious and require a large initial sample volume. Fractionating distillation, however, simplifies this repeated distillation by providing continuous separations. A fractionating column is utilized to provide extensive surface area to allow for heat exchange between rising vapor and falling condensate; through a recursive mechanism, the upper vapors are more pure in the more volatile compound and the liquid is more pure in the less volatile compound. The degree of separation depends on the different boiling points of compounds as well as the rate of distillation, insulation, and column efficiency. By allowing more time to distill, thermal equilibrium can be reached and higher purities achieved. Likewise, insulation prevents heat loss to preserve initial conditions and column efficiency determines how many distillation “pockets” can occur.
==Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)==
Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) is a simple and quick procedure for separating and identifying components in a mixture. In principle, different components in a mixture have different solubility and differ in their strength of attraction to an adsorbent. This method utilizes this principle and has the mixture to be analyzed performed on a plate with thin layer of a solid adsorbent and then has the plate immersed in a solvent. Components in the mixture will slowly travel up the plate at different rates until they reach the maximum separation for this particular combination of solvent and adsorbent. After the mixture is separated into different colored spots, the plate is dried and the components are examined. 

Technique:

1.Choose a solvent to be used to analyze the mixture, and then pour it into a beaker to a depth less than 0.5cm. The entire process is carried out in a beaker with watch glass on the top to prevent solvent vapor from escaping. 

2.A TLC plate is prepared. A TLC plate is made with a thin layer of adsorbent, usually silica or alumina. Near the bottom of the plate, use a pencil to draw a line across the plate. This line will be the origin where you spot the mixture to be analyzed. 

3.Place the plate in beaker so that only the bottom of the plate is immersed in the solvent.  

4.When the solvent rises up by capillary action and past the spot applied, some components of the mixture will travel at faster rate due to their solubility with the solvent and their adsorption strength to the plate. 

5.Different separation of colored spots will be seen on the plate. If the spots are not colored, UV lamp is used to visualize the plate. 

[[File:Thin Layer Chromatography.JPG|thumb|1: Origin 2, 3: New positions of compound 4: Distance traveled by solvent ]]

To identify the compounds present, the distance travelled by the solvent and the distance travelled by individual spots are then measured from the plate. Using these measurements, a retention factor, Rf is obtained by the following equation: 
                         Rf = (Distance traveled by the compound)/(Distance traveled by the solvent)
From the value of Rf, the polarity of a compound can be predicted. Moreover, this value can be used to compare two compounds. If two substances have the same Rf value, there is a high chance that they are the same compound. Otherwise, they are certainly different compounds.

[[Image:Paper.jpg‎|thumbnail|Thin Layer Chomatography(TLC)]]
Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) is useful for determining the composition of compounds in a mixture and also for distinguishing two compounds from one another. In TLC, glass, metal, or plastic plates coated with a thin layer of adsorbent serve as the stationary phase and a pure solvent or mixture of solvents act as the mobile phase. Most nonvolatile solid organic compounds can be analyzed by TLC. To carry out a TLC experiment, a small amount of the mixture being separated is dissolved in a suitable solvent and applied or spotted on the adsorbent near one end of a TLC plate. The plate is then placed in a closed chamber with the edge nearest the applied spot immersed in a shallow layer of the mobile phase called the developing solvent. The solvent is then allowed to rise through the stationary phase by capillary action. As the solvent ascends the plate, the sample is distributed between the mobile and stationary phase, separating as a result of the different polarities between both the phases and the compounds being separated. The more polar a compound is, the more tightly it binds to the adsorbent, and the more slowly it moves on the TLC plate. The developing solvent moves nonpolar substances up the plate most rapidly and polar substances travel up more slowly. The TLC plate is then removed when the solvent front is about 1&amp;nbsp;cm from the top and its position is marked. The Rf (Retention front or Ratio to front) can be calculated based on how much the compound moves up the plate when compared to the baseline. 
Rf = distance compound traveled / distance solvent front traveled. The range of this value can go from 0 to 1. An Rf of 0.2 is generally desirable. However, this value can be adjusted by changing the polarity of the solvent used during the mobile phase. The plate is then dried in a fume hood and visualization methods are used to analyze the plates.

To better understand the general principles underlying this process, it is helpful to scale up thin-layer chromatography to sizes of objects we see very often.

Imagine:

'''Stationary phase''' as the beach

'''Mobile phase''' as waves that wash up to the shore and return back to the sea. 

'''Compounds''' as people of different mass

Initially, two people of differing mass are sitting at the same position on the beach. As the waves wash up to their position, it will pull in the lighter person closer into the sea. As time goes on, the lighter person will be distanced from the heavier person due to their differing attraction to the sand. The distance they have traveled from their initial location are distinct and serve as a characterization and separation factor of the two individuals.
Although in thin-layer chromatography, the mobile phase moves in one direction and the compounds do not differ necessarily by mass but by their differences in affinity to the stationary phase and mobile phase, this example is helpful to picture the general idea of this important process for the identification and separation of mixed compounds.

== TLC plate Composition and Preparation ==

Solid supports to which the stationary phase is bound onto can be made up of glass, plastic, or aluminum sheet. The most common compound used to make the stationary phase is silica gel. Since it is porous, it has a large surface area which facilitates in desirable extensive interactions with compounds. The stationary phase must be bound onto the chosen solid support. This is done by mixing the silica gel with compounds which aid the silica gel particles in adhering to the solid support. The prepared mixture is then spread onto the solid support and allowed to dry.

== Visualization Methods for TLC==
There are two simple and basic methods of visualize, fluorescence and Iodine visualization. Fluorescence involves the use of adsorbents that contain a fluorescent indicator. The insoluble inorganic indicator is then detected when the outputs from a short-wavelength ultraviolet lamp are used to illuminate the adsorbent side of the plate in a dark box. The separated compounds appear as dark spots on the florescent field because the substances forming the spots usually quench the fluorescence of the adsorbent. These spots can later be analyzed. 
Another way to visualize colorless organic compounds is to use their adsorption of Iodine vapor. This is done by placing the plate in a bath of iodine vapor. Colored spots are gradually produced from the reaction of the substances with iodine vapor. The spots are dark brown on the white to tan background. After 10–15 minutes, the plate can be removed and the spot should be outlined with a pencil as the spot often disappears before being analyzed later.

== Gas Chromatography ==
[[Image:Gas chromatograph.png‎‎|thumbnail|Gas Chromatography Apparatus]]
Gas Chromatography (GC) can quickly assess the purity of a compound but cannot identify a compound by its own unless a known same is available to use as a standard. By comparing retention times, peak enhancements, and chromatogram, the identity of the components of the mixture can be determined. GC is very useful for quantitative analysis of a component mixture as a comparison of relative peak areas on the chromatogram often gives a good approximation of relative amounts of each compound.

Gas chromatography works by essentially having two phases work with each other. The mobile phase, in other words a 'moving phase', is carried out but a inert gas such as helium or an nonreactive gas such as nitrogen. The stationary phase is a microscopic layer of liquid or polymer that is supported by an inert solid that is placed inside a piece of glass tubing which is called a column. The gaseous compounds being analyzed in the mixture dispensed interact with the walls of the column that is coated with a stationary phase. Because of different polarity and affinities that various compounds display with the stationary phase, a retention time is calculated based on how long the compound spends time binding to the stationary phase while the mobile phase moves up the stationary phase. The various compounds continuously bind back and forth to the stationary phase and the mobile phase and are separated by the various strength in intermolecular interactions they share with the stationary phase. It the comparison of the retention times between compounds that displays the efficiency and application to the gas chromatographer. 

== Infrared Spectroscopy ==
Infrared spectroscopy is one of the most useful spectroscopic techniques in organic chemistry because it is a rapid and effective method for identifying the presence or absence of simple functional groups within a compound. When IR energy is passed through a sample, absorption bands are observed and these bands are then correlated with types of chemicals bonds which can provide important information about the nature of functional groups in the sample. An IR spectrum has energy measured as frequency of wavelength against intensity of the absorption. This is the result of molecular vibrations. The atoms making up a molecule are in constant motion and the movements of the atoms relative to each other can be described as vibration. The photons of IR radiation absorbed by an organic compound have just the right amount of energy to stretch or bend its covalent bond. An absorption band appears in an infrared spectrum as a result of this vibration. These bands are affected by different vibration modes of the compound, its polarity, as well as its bond order.There are different types of vibration modes at a tetrahedral carbon. They are stretching, bending, scissoring, rocking, twisting, and wagging. For stretching, it can be either symmetric or asymmetric.

'''Information on how an IR spectrum comes to be'''
The mid infrared is the region that provides the most information to organic chemists. The region spans from 4000&amp;nbsp;cm-1 to 600&amp;nbsp;cm-1. This region is where the absorptions of most of the simple functional groups of organic molecules appear. An IR spectrum plots the wavenumber (inverse of frequency) of a functional group against the intensity of the absorption. This is done by running a sample of interest in an infrared spectrometer and when a certain functional group is recognized, a peak will appear on the spectrum. The wavenumber corresponds to the frequency in which the functional group absorbs energy and the intensity measures how strongly the function group is absorbed. 
	Since the atoms that make up a molecule are in constant motion, they are said to “vibrate.” When these groups absorb the right amount of energy from the photons they are hit with, the molecules will gain enough energy to stretch or bend their covalent bonds. Stretching and bending are two different types of vibration. The energy levels of the molecular vibrations of a molecule are quantized, meaning that vibrations will only occur if the infrared energy matches the frequencies of the molecular vibrations exactly. If the energy does not match, no absorption will occur. Thus, if a function group is not present, there will be no absorption peak on the IR spectrum, making IR spectroscopy a very powerful tool in identifying function groups in a molecule. 
	In addition, bond order can give additional insight into where certain peaks can appear in an IR spectrum. Bond order is the amount of bonding that occurs between two molecules. The bond order between carbon atoms increase as one moves from an alkane to an alkene to an alkyne. The bond order increases with the number of bonds between the two bonding atoms. The higher the bond order of the atoms, the higher the wavenumber the molecule absorbs at, and the greater the energy needed to produce a stretching vibration. 
	Atomic mass also provides information as to the location of the absorption of certain molecules on the IR spectrum. The larger the atomic mass of the vibrating atoms, the higher frequency and the more energy it takes to stretch the bonds of molecule. 

'''Identifying function groups on an IR spectrum	'''
	After many experiments done with an IR spectrometer, scientists have found regions in which the stretching of certain function groups and bonds occur. An table is shown below:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Bond or functional group || Wavenumber (cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)
|-
| RO — H (alcohols) || 3200 - 3650
|-
| RC(=O)O — H (carboxylic acid) || 2500 - 3300
|-
| R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;N — H (amines) || 3250 - 3500
|-
| RC=C — H (alkynes) || 3260 - 3330
|-
| C=C — H (alkanes) || 2840 - 3000
|-
| C—H (alkanes) || 2840 - 3000
|-
| RC=CH (alkynes) || 2100–2260
|-
| RC=CN (nitriles) || 2220–2260
|-
| RC(C=O)H (aldehydes,&lt;br /&gt;RC(C=O)R’ (ketones) || 1690–1750
|-
| RC(C=O)OR’ (esters) || 1735–1750
|-
| RC(C=O)OH (carboxylic acid) || 1710–1760
|-
| -C=C- (alkenes) || 1620–1680
|-
| RC — OR’ (esters, alcohols) || 1000–1260
|}
Of the wavenumbers that each functional group can be absorbed at, there are three distinct regions: a functional group region, fingerprint region, and aromatic region. The function group region is between 4000 – 1500&amp;nbsp;cm-1¬, in which most of the peaks of the major function groups appear. The fingerprint region is between 1500 – 900&amp;nbsp;cm-1, where many of the bending vibrations appear. It is not as important as the functional group region, but gives you a region to confirm the presence of a certain bond if you are uncertain. The last region, which is between 900 – 600&amp;nbsp;cm-1, provides information about the presence of aromatic compounds, such as benzenes. 

IR spectroscopy alone is not enough to determine the structure of a molecule. It must be coupled with NMR spectroscopy to produce information for structure identification. 

Below are some IR spectra for the presence of certain function groups. 

IR of an alcohol:

(large wide peak between 3200 – 3400)
 
IR of a carbonyl group:

(strong peak around 1700)

==Nuclear Magnetic Resonance==
NMR is one of the most important tools for analysis in organic chemistry and biochemistry. In comparison to other protein-determining techniques, NMR can be advantageous because it analyzes the structure of macromolecules in solution. Other techniques, such as x-ray crystallography, requires macromolecules to be crystallized. NMR is also very useful in that it can show the dynamic side of protein structure, revealing details regarding conformational changes, folding, and interactions with other proteins. NMR technique uses low energy radiation within the radio frequency range.  The radiation excites atomic nuclei, however only certain specific isotopes are excited; most commonly &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C.  These atomic nuclei can be modeled as spinning around an axis, this property is known as nuclear spin.  Since hydrogen is essentially a proton, its spinning motion creates a magnetic field.  For all intents and purposes, the hydrogen can be imagined to be synonymous with a magnet floating freely in space.

When these atomic nuclei are excited by an external magnetic field, they can have one of two orientations, an alpha or beta spin state.  These nuclei, 1H and 13C, can be taken as tiny atomic magnets that can align with (alpha) or against (beta) the magnetic field. Alpha being more energetically favorable, and beta being a high energy state.  Radiating a sample at just the right frequency to flip between alpha and beta spin states, creates resonance; in which the sample absorbs energy to flip to the beta spin state.  After excitation the nuclei return to their original state, so at resonance the nuclei are constantly switching spin states.  Nuclei in the beta state give off energy when relaxing to the alpha state. The resonance frequency at which this happens is proportional to how strong the external magnetic field is. The resonance frequency changes from nuclei to nuclei based upon the properties of its nucleus and environment.

===Hydrogen (1H) NMR===
Resonance frequencies largely depend on the polarity of bonds, the hybridization of attached atoms, and the presence of electron donating or withdrawing groups.  When hydrogen is near an electron withdrawing group, such as chloromethane, the hydrogens are said to be deshielded because the polarity of the bonds pulls the hydrogens' electron cloud away from the nuclei.  The opposite is known as shielding.  These two phenomenon cause different hydrogens to have different resonance frequencies, and therefore different peaks.  A peak is said to be at high field, or shifted right when the corresponding nuclei is shielded, and low field, or shifted left when the nuclei is deshielded.

[[Image:NMR.gif|left|Ester Resonance]][[Image:NMR structre.gif]]

From the example NMR above, you can see how the shielding and deshielding affect the peaks.  The &quot;C&quot; group hydrogen, is far left because it is deshielded by the carbonyl group.  The &quot;B&quot; group hydrogens are slightly less deshielded due to the aromaticity, and the &quot;A&quot; group hydrogens are barely deshielded at all.

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR
Hydrogen Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is one of the most used NMR since &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H has a nuclear spin. It is positively charged. When it spins, it creates a magnetic field. When an external magnetic field is added, the proton can either have ''a'' or ''B'' spin. The energy difference between these two states generates resonance. Different atom have different strength of the applied magnetic field. (CH3)4Si is used as a standard. the distance between the frequency of an atom to the frequency of (CH3)4Si is called chemical shift. 

Chemical Shift = (distance of peak from (CH3)4Si in Hertz) / ( spectrometer frequency in megahertz) ppm

Here are some examples of commonlly used chemical shifts:

Primary alkyl: 0.8-1.0 ppm

Secondary alkyl: 1.2-1.4 ppm

Tertiary alkyl: 1.4-1.7 ppm

Terminal alkene: 4.6-5.0ppm

Internal alkene: 5.2-5.7ppm

Alkyne: 1.7-3.1ppm

Alcohol: 0.5-5.0 ppm

Aromatic: 6.0-9.5ppm

It should be noted that the NMR spectra for the OH functionality of alcohols, the SH functional group of thiols, and the NH2 group of amines possess characteristically broad peaks. 

Hydrogens that are in different chemical environments (meaning they have different atoms attached to them thus have different bond strengths and lengths that change how electrons &quot;gather&quot; around them) give different chemical shifts. An environment that is electron poor is considered deshielded and gives low field absorptions (farther to the left in the spectrum). In contrast, an electron rich enviornment is shielded and results in high-field peaks (farther to the right). Equivalent hydrogens give the same signal. Compounds have the same environment if they have the same connectivity and bond strengths/lengths. for example a molecule of benzene has 6 different hydrogens but they are all in the same environment.

[[File:Benzene-6H-delocalized.svg|thumbnail|center|Equal Hydrogens on Benzene]]

It is important to know how to distinguish the equivalence of hydrogen in order to read the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR. This could be easy to spot like the electronegativity of the atoms around the nucleus of interest (hydrogen in this case), but the changes could be more subtle like symmetry in the molecule that makes some hydrogens equivalent. For this, the molecule phenol will be shown. 

[[File:Phenol-2.svg|thumbnail|center|Symmetry makes hydrogen similar]]

Although the hydroxyl group does change the shielding of the hydrogens there are only three different hydrongens. The ones right next to the OH group are both similar by connectivity but also by symmetry. The line of symmetry makes them alike since nature knows not of right and left. H's connected to the same carbon usually have the same shift but not all the time. if no symmetry can be assesed than the hydrogens are completely different. Besides this, there is another hint that &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR gives us to help us to deduce the structure of a compound. It is the integration. By comparing the relative areas under the peaks, the ratio of hydrogens can be determined. We can find the relative number of hydrogens by looking at integration. Also, by looking at the splitting, we can find the neighboring hydrogens. The interaction of hydrogens with each other interrupts their magnetic field, thus affecting the shape of their peaks. One sharp peak is called singlet; One of the two-peak set is called doublet; One of the three-peak set is called triplet; One of the four-peak set is called quartet and etc.   It follows the '''n + 1 rule'''. For instance, if we see one peak, there are no hydrogens attached to the atom next to the atom bonding to the hydrogen. If we see a doublet, that means the neighboring atom of the carbon that this hydrogen or these equivalent hydrogens are attached to has one hydrogen attached to it because the hydrogen affected the peak.

===Carbon (13C) NMR===
Carbon has the same idea as 1H NMR but 12C does not respond to NMR so the less abundant 13C is what will show up in the NMR spectra. Only about 1% of the carbon present in molecules is 13C and thus the peaks are not as intense as 1H. This lack of abundance is key because now carbons are not affected by the neighboring carbons because the chances of having two 13C atoms next to each other very unlikely. This is actually quite helpful because if there was more 13C not only would there be a disturbances in the 13C NMR but also in the 1H NMR and this would complicate NMR Spectra. The only thing that changes the peaks are the neighboring hydrogens. The same idea applies as in 1H with respect to singlets, doublets, trpilets, etc.

==Mix Melting Point==
	The identity of an unknown crystal can be determined by using the process of mix melting point. Mix melting point involves mixing equal amounts of the unknown crystals and another compound of a known melting point. Firstly, the melting point of the unknown crystal is determined; then, one can perform a mix melting point with a compound of known melting point that is closest to that of the unknown crystal. A mixture of the unknown and the known of equal amounts will be grounded together with a spatula and inserted into a capillary tube. Then, the mixture is inserted into a melting point apparatus for the determination of its melting point. In this situation, the unknown is acting like an impurity to the known compound. Impurities generally lower the melting point of the known crystals. A different melting point is observed when two different crystals are mixed because mixing two different compounds will disrupt the crystal lattices of the crystals affecting its physical properties such as melting point. One compound has acted as an impurity toward the other by lowering its melting point. If the melting point of this mixture is identical to that of the known, the mixture is made of two identical compounds meaning the unknown and the known are of the same identity since the same compound cannot act as an impurity to itself. 

Example: If the unknown compound(might not be a pure compound) is determined to have a melting point of 110°C, now choose a known compound of the closest melting point to that of the unknown. In this case, it would be fluorine and perform a mix melting point with the unknown.
known Compound and Melting Point (Celsius)
Benzil – 95
Fluorene-114
9 Fluorenone-84
Unknown+ Fluorene- 112°C

Just in case, perform a mix melting point of the unknown with another known compound, the one which has the 2nd closest melting point next to the unknown, which  is benzil. A quick mix melting point shows that a mixture of the two melts nowhere close to the 110s°C range, which rules out benzil as the unknown. Therefore, the unknown compound in this example is determined to be fluorene as the mix melting of the mixture is virtually the same as that of the unknown.
	Melting point is also crucial is determining the purity of a compound. For instance, if a known compound is pure, the melting point of this known can be used as a standard for measuring purity. By comparing the melting point of this pure compound to a sample compound of the same identity, one can determine the sample compound’s purity. The closer the sample’s melting point is to that of the pure compound, the more pure a sample is. This is because the purer the sample the less impurities. As we discussed earlier, the more impurities that are in a compound lead to decreasing the melting point. Therefore the same compound with the highest melting point is the purest also.

Melting point determinations are done using a melting point apparatus. The compound is loaded into a melting point capillary tube that is closed on one side. Usually some tapping is required to get the compound to the bottom of the tube. After the tube is loaded into the melting point apparatus, heat is applied gradually and the compound will start melting. The experimenter is able to track the progress of the melting by viewing the compound through a scope. The melting point determination apparatus provides an easy and quick way to determine the purity, and identity of a sample! &lt;ref name=&quot;melting point&quot;&gt;[http://www.wiredchemist.com/chemistry/instructional/laboratory-tutorials/determination-of-melting-point melting point], October 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shaving Horse Plans ==


The most useful of these home-made appliances is the shaving-horse, shown in side view by Fig. 153 and in end view by Fig. 154. To make this, get a plank about 6 ft. long and from 10 in. to 12 in. wide, and about 6 in. from each end bore two l 1/4-in. holes, and drive a leg in each, to form a stool as high as a chair; the legs must spread well, so as to make the bench firm. Get two pieces of ash or similar wood, 2 ft. 6 in. long, and about 3 in. by l 1/2-in., and in each piece bore two l 1/4-in. holes 6 in. from each end, and a 3/4-in. hole 13 in. from the top end ; these pieces are marked D in Figs. 153 and 154. Two round pieces fit the largest holes, one (e) 3 in. longer than the stool is wide, and the other (h) 12 in. longer. These must be driven tightly into the side pieces, to form a frame which will easily slip on the stool. Bore a

[[File:19th_century_knowledge_carpentry_and_woodworking_shaving_horse_side_view.jpg]]

3/4-in hole through the stool edgeways, 1 ft. 9 in. from one end, and, putting the frame on, pass a bolt (1) through the sides of the frame and through the stool. There now is a stool with a frame swinging on it. The longer round piece should be at the bottom, and should project 4 1/2 in. at each side. A block of wood,

[[File:19th_century_knowledge_carpentry_and_woodworking_shaving_horse_end_view.jpg]]

10 in. long and about 4 in. wide by 3 in. thick (see F), must be fixed in the centre of stool, an inch or two nearer the long end than the bolt, I. To fix F, tenon it through the top of stool and pin it. Cut off the block on the bevel as illustrated, so that a board a, which is 6 in. wide, will bed on top of it; fix this board to the short end of the bench. Fig. 153 explains what is meant. A cushion (j) upon which to sit is placed on the shaving-horse, which then is complete.

The method of using the shaving-horse is to sit astride it, place the wood to be shaved on the board G (Figs. 153 and 154), and put the feet, one on each side, on the projecting pieces h, thrusting them forward ; the frame swings on the bolt I, and clips the wood between the board G and the round piece E ; the more pressure required on the work the more are the feet thrust forward. This shaving-horse is a very useful appliance in any wood-working shop.

== Simple Shaving Horse ==

A good shaving horse may be made of a plank eight inches wide, The illustration shows the manner of constructing it so plainly that description is not necessary. The lower end of the plank should be pinned or spiked down. The plank may be ten or twelve feet long, and the length of the legs govern the pitch.

== How to Make a Shaving Horse ==

One of the most useful devices on a farm is a shaving horse. Make a bench 18 inches high of a good 2-inch plank, c, level off the edges so that it will make a comfortable seat. Upon this place a slanting platform, b, through which is cut a hole in which the clamp, a, works.

[[File:19th_century_knowledge_carpentry_and_woodworking_shaving_horse.jpg]]

The clamp must be made of heavy hard wood that is tough and will not split. The shank must be an extension of the clamp, a. Several holes in the plank will allow the clamp to be raised so as to take in larger pieces of wood. The treadle, g, is kept in place by a peg at h. To operate this horse the workman places his foot upon the treadle, inserts the wood to be clamped under the edge of a, and pushes backward upon the treadle. This clamps the wood and the drawing knife can be used readily and much more rapidly than with a vise.

*'''Database''' - a collection of organized data that allows you to look up, edit or report on it.
*'''Table''' - 
*'''Record''' - The rows in a table that contain information about a given person, product, or event. 
*'''Field''' - The columns in a table that contain a specific piece of information like the city, state, or phone number.  
*'''Query''' - The ability to access the data by asking questions.  Getting out all the companies that are in a certain city, or all the clients with the last name of Smith.  
*'''Forms''' - Attractive layouts used for entering or looking up records in a table. 
*'''Reports''' - Attractive layouts used for printing out the data with sophisticated presentation. 
*'''Web Page''' - A SharePoint for information that is stored in Access so it can be seen on the web. 
*'''Primary Key''' - a unique identifier for a record. There can be only one.  Every record must have a different value in a field that is set up to be a primary key.  If it is a table of products and the PRODUCT ID is the primary key, no two records can have the same ID.  
*'''Data type''' - Specifying the type of data a certain field will hold.  Access needs to know if you are going to work with a number, text, a time/date or a hyperlink. 
*'''Field Size''' - Specifying how large the field will be.  Access needs to know how large a text box needs to be created to hold text type data. 
*'''Design view''' - A view that allows you to manipulate how data will be created, stored, and displayed on the screen and in reports.  
*'''Datasheet view''' - A view of a table that is much like a spreadsheet. It allows you to enter in your information quickly. 
*'''Report View''' - Once you create a report, you need to turn it to report view to preview it on the screen. 
*'''Form View''' - Once you create a form, you need to turn it to form view to enter data, or use if for lookup. 
*'''Form Layout''' - Once you create a form, you need to turn it to layout view if you wish to move items around on your form. 
*'''Report Wizard''' - A tool that allows you to create a report by simply choosing what table and fields in the table you want to display.  The report is built for you very quickly.

==Lesson==
===What is a database?===
A database is a collection of organized tables.  Each table is a collection of related records.  Each record  gives information about one item and is made up of many fields.  Each field is one specific piece of information.  


[[File:AC1-Database_layout.jpg]]

&lt;p&gt;In this figure you can see the Clients Table is open in the Access work area.  It contains 10 records, one for each client.  There are nine fields: Client number, Client name, Street Address, City, State, Zip Code, Amount Paid, Type of Advertisement, and Employee.

===Guidelines===
&lt;p&gt;Before you start to create a database, there needs to be a lot of planning.  The first question should be: What is the purpose of the database?  I usually want to know, what do I want to be able to pull back out of the database.  So I guess I work backwards from the reports to figure out what will need to be put in.  
#What is the purpose of the database
#Who all will use the database
#What will each type of user need to be able to do
#*What reports does each user need
#*What forms does each user need
#*What transactions will each user need to document
#Determine the tables that you will need
#Determine the primary key fields
#Determine all other fields that you will need in each table
#Determine data types for each field
#Determine field size for each field
#Determine the relationship between the tables
#Determine what fields will need to link the tables together
#Remove any redundancy in the tables

===Requirements===
&lt;p&gt;The yearbook staff need to keep track of their yearbook ad sales to the businesses in the community.  In order to do this they will need to track the businesses of the community and what businesses have purchased ads, what types of ads they have purchased and if they have paid.  They will also need to keep track of each student, in this case employee, to determine who has sold the ads.  
&lt;p&gt;The staff will need to keep track of two basic groups of data, the businesses and the yearbook staff members.  For this example we will call the businesses - Clients, and the staff members - Employees. 
&lt;p&gt;For the clients we will need to know: 
*Client Number
*Client Name
*Street Address
*City
*State
*Zip Code
*Amount Paid
*Type of Advertisement
*Employee Number
&lt;p&gt;For the Employees we will need to know: 
*Employee Number
*Last Name
*First Name
*Street Address
*City
*State
*Zip Code
*Number of Ads Sold
*Dollar Value Sold

===Name the tables and fields===
*They must not be longer then 64 characters
*You can use letters, integers, spaces, and some punctuation marks
*They cannot contain: periods (.), exclamation points(!), asterisks(*), question marks(?), accent marks(`) or square brackets([])
*The same name cannot be used twice
*Pick a logical naming convention so you can find your information quickly
**Use upper cases to start words - Client Name
**Use no space between words - ClientName
**Use an underscore between words - Client_Name
&lt;p&gt;We will call the two tables: Clients and Employees
===Primary Keys===
Each table needs to have a primary key.  This is the one value in each table that can not be repeated, it is considered the look-up value.  This field is used to easily access all the data for one record and usually has a short field length.  For this example we will use the: 
*Employee Number
*Client Number
===Relationships between tables===
When you design a database you need to be able to tie the data together.  In most databases you have one table that is used once and tied to many records in another table.  In this example the Client is used once, and each client is tied to an employee.  So, each record in the employee table is used many times.  This is called a '''One to Many''' relationship. 
&lt;p&gt;Employee A works with
*Client 1
*Client 2
*Client 3
*Client 4

===Data types===
When you are creating the fields you also need to think about what type of data you are collecting in each field.  Here is a run down of each data type: 
&lt;/center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Structure of the Client Table
|-
!STYLE=&quot;background-color:#409FFF&quot; WIDTH=&quot;10%&quot; |Data Type
!STYLE=&quot;background-color:#409FFF&quot; WIDTH=&quot;70%&quot; |Description
|-
|Text
|255 Characters of any type of character including numbers
|-
|Memo
|Used when you want more than 255 characters of space and can contain any type of character
|-
|Number
|Only numbers that are used for some type of arithmetic manipulation.  If you do not plan on adding, subtracting, multiplying or dividing the number it is safer to make it type text.  
|-
|Currency
|Used for money and will auto-format to contain the dollar sign, commas and a two digit decimal.  
|-
|Date/Time
|Used when you are going to store a date or a time
|-
|AutoNumber
|This field will start at 1 for the first record and each additional record will be one higher.  This is great for use with invoice numbers.  
|-
|Yes/No
|This field is a check box that stores either yes/no, true/false, or on/off.  
|-
|OLE Object
|An object linked or embedded in the table
|-
|Hyperlink
|Text that can be used as a hyperlink address
|-
|Attachment
|This field will contain an attached file.  This is handy if you are doing an on-line application and want have the user attach a resume.  
|-
|}
===Redundancy===
&lt;p&gt;The point to using a database instead of a spreadsheet is the ability to link tables together.  This is useful for reducing redundancy.  
&lt;p&gt;Redundancy is the repetition of the same data over and over again.  For example if you are tying clients to employees, you would not want to have to tie the same employee name, address, city, state, and zip to every record.  Instead you can link them both together with an employee number and store the data in separate files.  
&lt;p&gt;By storing the data in separate file it reduces the risk that data will not be updated properly.  Think about if an employee moves and the employee data is in the same table as the clients.  You would have to go through all the records that had that employee and change the same data for each record that employee works with.  
===Client Table===
[[File:AC1-Create Ribbon.jpg]]
&lt;p&gt;From the Access Window click on the: 
*Create Tab
*Go to the TABLE Group on the far left of the ribbon
*Click on the TABLE button 
[[File:AC1-Table_Design_View.jpg]]
&lt;p&gt;Click on View and Design View
&lt;p&gt;[[File:AC1-Save_Table.jpg‎]]
&lt;p&gt;Click on OK
&lt;p&gt;Then fill in the fields on the design view of the form to follow the structure of the table below. You will need to enter the field name, data type, and field size as the arrows above show.

&lt;p&gt;Once you are done putting in the field definitions then you will need to put in the data. 
*Click on VIEW 
*Click on Datasheet View
&lt;P&gt;Then you can enter the data just like a spreadsheet. 
&lt;p&gt;HINT: If you do not like entering the data this way you can click on FORM and and it will create a form for you to enter the data into a form.

      <comment>/* Running the gel */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Electrophoresis is the movement and subsequent separation of ions and charge macromolecules through  a medium when an electric potential is applied. It is a powerful tool used in fundamental research and diagnostic settings for  analysis of biomolecules. It is commonly used for purity and molecular weight determination for both DNA and protein solutions. 


==Theory==
The idea behind DNA gel electrophoresis is to separate the fragments of a DNA sample and compare the results to a positive and negative control to determine if a DNA sample contains a particular gene. The size of the DNA fragments in the sample are determined by the specific primers used to fragment the DNA. The primers used will vary depending on the gene that is in question. For example, a DNA gel searching for the MPI (mannose phosphate isomerase) will use different primers than a Vil-Cre gel. Electrophoresis is a very powerful method to separate proteins and other macromolecules such as DNA and RNA. The speed of migration of a protein, DNA, or RNA molecule in an electric field is contingent on the strength of the electric field, the net charge of the protein, and the frictional coefficient. These turns can be summarized in the equation v = Ez/f, where v is the speed of migration, E is the electric field strength, and f is the frictional coefficient. Electrophoresis experiments are generally carried out in gels because the gel can act as a molecular sieve that amplifies the effects of separation. Small proteins move very quickly through the gel, while large proteins do not move as rapidly, staying near the point of application.

==Agarose Gel==
The structure of an agarose polymer is as follows:

[[image:Structure_of_Agarose_Polymer.jpg]]

In DNA electrophoresis, agarose gel is the common support material used. Agarose is a linear polymer of D-galactose and 3,6-anhydrogalactose that is isolated from seaweed. It forms a macroporous matrix which allows rapid diffusion of high molecular weight macromolecules without significant restriction by the gel. 
The concentration of agarose in the gel determines the average pore size. The size of a gel controls the mobility and resolution of components because of the sieving effect of the pores on macromolecular species.

==Preparing the sample==
Typically, the DNA sample is prepared by adding the specific primers to fragment the DNA and a loading dye which allows the DNA bands to show after the image is captured.

==Loading the sample==
After the agarose gel sets, the samples are loaded into the wells. Along with the samples in question, two control samples, a positive and negative control, are loaded as well. The positive sample of DNA will already be confirmed to contain the gene in question. The negative control should not contain any genetic material whatsoever and should therefore appear as a blank slot in the gel.

Additionally, a DNA ladder is loaded into one of the wells. The ladder contains fragments of known sizes and essentially serves as the ruler in determining the size of the sample bands. Various ladders can be used, depending on the sample being tested. Two common ladder sizes are 100 base pairs and 1000 base pairs. Each of these have very different ranges.

[[image:Apoptotic DNA Laddering.png|thumb|various DNA ladders]]

==Running the gel==
In order to run the sample DNA through the gel, a running buffer (PBS) is added to the gel box until it submerges the gel. Then, the sample is exposed to an electrical current, allowing the DNA to move through the gel and separating the various fragments in the process. After the voltage is applied, the sieving ability of the gel separates the proteins based on their size, with the smallest proteins moving most rapidly. The distance of mobility of polypeptide chains under these conditions can be measured by looking at the inverse logarithm of their mass. The mobility of the polypeptide chains is linearly proportional to this value. 

[[image:Electrophoresis DNA.jpg|thumb|gel box with DNA samples]]

After the DNA sample runs through a significant portion of the gel, an image of the various bands can be collected. By comparing the sample bands to the control bands, a researcher is able to determine if a DNA sample contains the specific gene being tested for. The strength of separation by electrophoresis can be seen through examining fractions produced during the purification scheme. The fractions that are produced initially will show many different proteins. However, as the separation runs for longer time, the number of bands will shrink, and the intensity of one of the bands should increase. The band with the highest intensity should reveal the protein of interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hydrolysis is the process of a water reaction. It means to break using water. Hydrolysis comes from the Greek work ''hydro'' meaning water; and ''lysis'' meaning break. This occurs through a water molecule cleaving into two parts of a molecule; one molecule will get the H+ ion, while the other part of the molecule receives the OH- group. Hydrolysis reaction is used to break down polymers into monomers.

Hydrolysis is important for plants and animals in order for them to sustain life. This process helps to make energy for metabolism and storage. All of this is needed for biosynthesis of small molecules, as well as, active transport of molecules across the cellular membrane. It is also used in oxidation reaction and ATP.

Hydrolysis reactions help the catalysis reaction in living organisms by a class of enzymes known as hydrolases. The biochemical reactions that break down polymers such as proteins (peptide bonds between amino acids), nucleotides, complex sugars and starch, and fats are catalyzed by this class of enzymes. Within this class, lipases, amylases and proteinases hydrolyze fats, sugars and proteins, respectively.

Cellulose-degrading bacteria and fungi play a special role in paper production and other everyday biotechnology applications, because they have enzymes (cellulases and esterases) that can break cellulose into polysaccharides (polymers of sugar molecules) or glucose, and break down stickies.

Enzymes accelerate reactions by lower the activation energy required for the reaction. They play very important roles in the biological world. Proteolysis enzymes are one of the classes of enzymes which are very specificity. The mechanism of proteolytic enzyme catalyze proteolysis is showed below:

[[image:Hydrolysis.pdf|500px]]

==Examples==
Cleavage of peptide bonds between amino acids are made by hydrolysis. Water is activated by a protease to instigate the reaction. The hydroxyl ion from the water acts as a neucleophile and attacks the carbon of the carbonyl group of the ester or amide. In an aqueous base, hydroxyl ions are better nucleophiles than dipoles such as water. In acid, the carbonyl group becomes protonated, and this leads to a much easier nucleophilic attack. The products for both hydrolyses are compounds with carboxylic acid groups.

Moreover, hydrolysis is an important process in plants and animals because of its use in energy metabolism and storage. The energy storing molecule, adenosine triphosphate (ATP)contains pyrophosphate linkages (bonds formed when two phosphate units are combined together) that release energy when the pyrophosphate bonds are broken. Hydrolysis is used in order to break these bonds. ATP can undergo hydrolysis in two ways: the removal of terminal phosphate to form adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate, or the removal of a terminal diphosphate to yield adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate.

Furthermore, most biochemical reactions use catalytic actions to instigate hydrolysis of proteins, fats, oils, and carbohydrates to be broken down into their monomers for processing and energy. For example, microbes employ cellulosomes, a multienzyme complex containing hemicellulase, cellulase, and even pectinase, to hydrolyze plant cell walls made up of polysaccharides and release energy. Currently there is research in transforming cellulosic biomass into sugar, which can then be transformed into a viable energy source such as ethanol. However, breaking down the cellulose from the biomass is difficult to do in the lab and requires a variety of enzymes working in sync. Understanding how cellulosomes do their work might just be the key to solving the energy crisis.

Another example of hydrolysis within our body is our digestive system. The material we eat, food, comes into our body in the form of polymer. The food is too large to enter our cells. As the food enters our digestive tracts, various enzymes work to break down the food (polymer), which in turn will speed up hydrolysis. The resulting monomers will be small enough to be absorbed into our bloodstream to be distributed to all the cells in our body. Those cells can then perform dehydration reactions, the opposite of hydrolysis, to take those monomers to form new and different polymers that can be used as other specific functions in the body.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The analysis of patterns of selected enzymes has been used extensively as a technique to identify the species of origin of cell lines with a high degree of certainty. Isoenzymes (or isoenzymes) are structurally different forms or the same enzyme. They catalyse the same reaction but have different protein structures. Each cell line would have its own unique array of isoenzymes.

The technique involves gel electrophoresis of cell homogenates under non-denaturing conditions. Specific activity stains are used to develop a banding pattern of isoenzymes (zymogram), which is characteristic of a particular cell line. Such zymograms are usually photographed to provide a permanent record of each cell line.

[[Image:Plasmodium_knowlesi_hemoglobinase_imprint.jpg|thumb|zymogram of endopeptidase enzyme|200px]]

Of the various enzymes that can be separated into isoenzymes by this technique, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and nucleoside phosphorylase have been particularly well characterised. By using several enzymes the distinguishing features of a cell line are established. These features can often distinguish cell lines even if derived from the same species.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Agglutination occurs when an [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein function/Antibodies|antibody]] interacts with antigen, resulting in cross-linking of the antigen particles by the antibody. This eventually leads to clumping. &quot;Agglutination&quot; comes from the Latin root ''agglutinare''. &quot;Agglutinare&quot; means, &quot;to glue&quot;. Cross-linking, or cross-matching is done to determine matches. Agglutination may occur when an unideterminate, multivalent antigen interacts with a single antibody. It may also occur if a multi determinate, univalent antigen interacts with at least two distinct antibodies. 

Cross Agglutination: when an antibody that is raised against a similar antigen agglutinates that antigen. 

Group Agglutination: when a collection of similar organisms is agglutinated by an agglutinin that is specific for that collection. 

'''&lt;u&gt;Applications for the agglutination test&lt;/u&gt;'''

'''BLOOD TYPING
There are different blood groups like A,B, AB and O. The different blood types are differentiated according to the types of proteins on the surfaces of the red blood cells. Human red blood cells may either posses both of epitopes A and B on their surfaces. Individuals possessing only epitope A have anti-B antibody in their serum, while individuals possessing only epitope B on their red blood cells have circulating anti-A antibody. Some individuals have neither epitope and both antibodies present, while others have both epitopes and neither antibody. 
Blood type determination can be performed by mixing a sample of the individual’s blood with w solutions: one containing anti-A antibody and the other containing anti-B antibody. Agglutination occurs if the antibodies match the epitopes of the blood cells. By observing the agglutination patterns, the blood type of the individual can be determined.

'''DETERMINING MATING TYPES IN ORGANISMS'''
Agglutination can be used to determine mating types in organisms such as Chlamydomonas. Extracts from cloned Chlamydomonas cells of either of the minus or plus type are added to cells of the opposite mating type as well as of the same mating type. What is observed is that, in the cells of similar type, no agglutination occurs. However, in the type with opposite mating type, agglutination does occur. Thus, this proves that the cells of different mating types are chemically different.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">VaYetze --- And He Went Out
Bereisheet/Genesis 28:10-32:3   Hoshea/Hosea 12:13-14:10 
Yochanan/John 1:45-49
		
VaYetze, &quot;And He Went Out,&quot; begins with Jacob (Ya'acov) leaving his family and going to the land of Haran (Charan) to find himself a wife among the daughters of his uncle, Laban. We find that he left his father's house in order to prevent Esau from committing murder as stated in Genesis 27:41. ( Esau intended to kill Jacob (Ya'acov)  regarding the blessings), therefore, find that Jacob (Ya'acov)  had in essence prevented a conflict by departing from his father's house. 

Evidently Jacob (Ya'acov) had originally escaped his brother's wrath by going to the house of Shem and staying there until Esau had apparently forgotten the incident.  But on his return Esau's wrath was rekindled and he was overheard by Rebecca to plot to kill him and so she arranges for him to go to Haran to take a wife. (Book of Jasher)

So Isaac summoned Jacob (Ya'acov) and blessed him; he instructed him, and said to him, 'Do not take a wife from the Canaanite women. Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother's father, and take a wife from there from the daughters of Laban your mother's brother. And may El Shaddai bless you, make you fruitful and make you numerous, and may you be a congregation of peoples. May He grant you the blessing of Abraham to you and to your offspring with you, that you may possess the land of your sojourns which God gave to Abraham&quot; (Genesis 28:1-4).

Jacob Ya'acov) journeys as far as the foot of Mt. Moriah, the place of his father's offering and Yahweh meets with him and and reemphasizes His covenant that He made with Abraham and Isaac and now to Jacob in this same place (Gen.22).  He says that the land where Jacob is presently residing will be given to him and to his seed or offspring.  He promises that they will multiply as the dust of the Earth, and &quot;spread out powerfully&quot; in all directions on the face of the Earth, and that these descendants will bless the world.  Yahweh promises to guard Jacob and his offspring and be with them wherever they may go as he exits the land of promise.

&quot;And behold! Yahweh was standing over him, and He said, 'I am Yahweh, God of Abraham your father and God of Isaac; the ground upon which you are lying, to you will I give it and to your descendants. Your offspring shall be as the dust of the earth, and you shall spread out powerfully westward, eastward, northward and southward; and all the families of the earth shall bless themselves by you and by your offspring.  Behold, I am with you; I will guard you wherever you go, and I will return you to this soil; for I will not forsake you until I will have done what I have spoken about you.'&quot;  	Bereisheet/Genesis 28:13-15

&quot;Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, 'Surely Yahweh is present in this place and I did not know!' And he became frightened and said, 'How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God and this is the gate of the heavens!'  Jacob arose early in the morning and took the stone that he placed around his head and set it up as a pillar; and he poured oil on its top. And he named that place Beth-el; however, Luz was the city's name originally&quot; 	(Bereisheet/Genesis 28:16-19).

Jacob also received a deeper understanding of God through his dream.  Jacob awakens to proclaim that he now knew things that he did not earlier understand (Genesis 28:16).  Jacob referred to the ladder as a &quot;gate of heaven.&quot;  This is considered an allusion to the Temple (&quot;Bet El&quot; = House of God - 28:18) and this is the place where the temple was erected later.   Jacob is identifying this place as the gateway between heaven and earth, Yahweh's chosen place of covenant relationship with His people which was first established with Abraham. Yeshua referred to himself as a gate (or door) and proclaimed himself to be &quot;greater than the Temple.&quot;  He is the entrance to the heavenly sanctuary.

Jacob (Ya'acov) had his first, life-changing personal encounter with the Elohim of his fathers. What is his response?  To serve Yahweh and to worship Him by giving him one-tenth (a tithe) of his increase. We need to faithfully use the firstfruits of our increase to honor, worship and express gratitude to Him.

Scripture calls not doing so 'robbing God' and that as a result a curse may be on our finances. Read Mal. 3:8-11. 

Proverbs 3:9 lays out a solid truth about how tithing is a form of worshipping the Creator,  &quot;Honour [glorify] Yahweh with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine&quot;.

Jacob in Haran
Jacob (Ya'acov) arrives in Haran, where he meets the daughters of Laban, Leah, the elder, and Rachel, the younger.  Both Rabbinic tradition and the Book of Jasher state that Leah and Rachel were twins.   We have a few sets of twins in this family line.

Scripture reveals the spiritual law of reciprocity: You reap what you sow (Gen. 8:22; Gal. 6:7-9). If you don't sow you will not reap.  If you sow evil or good you will reap evil or good.  Jacob had to learn this law the hard way. He gained the birthright through posing as Esau and Laban in turn deceives Jacob by putting Leah under the veil who poses as Rachel in Jacob¹s marriage bed.  It is very easy to see the principle of reaping and sowing in others lives, but in our own?  Very difficult!   Don't we concoct every excuse and argument imaginable to justify our actions and then blame the results on others?  Prayerfully take a long and hard look at your life, examine hardships and trials, and honestly ask yourself the question: am I reaping what I have sown?  It is never too late to repent and make a correction to bring your life into agreement with Yahweh's Word and will and start reaping the blessings.

Jacob had come to Haran to find his mate. Rachel was that mate, and Jacob devoted seven years of hard physical toil to win the right to marry her.  Living up to his reputation as a deceitful person, Laban substituted Leah for Rachel on the wedding night.  We see that there is no hint of Jacob getting angry nor did he fight with Laban. Jacob did not want to marry two sisters but he accepted it in submission to Yahweh's workings in his life as indeed it was to bring forth the nation of twelve tribes.  Afterwards, Laban offered Rachel in exchange for seven more years of hard work. Jacob accepted the deal, and the Midrash explains that Jacob worked the second set of years with the same loyalty and trustworthiness as he did in the first set of years.


All in a Day's Work
&quot;Any [animal] torn by wild beasts I have not brought to you, I bore the loss of it...whether stolen by day or stolen by night. I was there by day consumed by the heat and the frost at night, and my sleep was driven from my eyes&quot; 	(Genesis  31:38-40)

During the twenty years Jacob (Ya'acov) was with Laban, he served him with the utmost loyalty. The worst weather did not cause him to desist from the watchful care of Laban's flock. he paid for every accidental loss, although he bore no responsibility to do so. His trustworthiness as custodian of Laban's flock was a remarkable exercise of virtue, and serves as a model for us to follow.

The greatness of Jacob lay in the fact that he did not deceive Laban even though Laban deceived him.  Jacob still watched Laban's flock as if it were his own. If someone were to deceive one of us even in a small matter we would feel ourselves released from any obligation toward him.  Not so out forefather Jacob.  Despite all of Laban's deceptions, Jacob continued to guard Laban's sheep even beyond the call of duty.

The Lesson in Adversity
Genesis 29:31-35   &quot;Yahweh saw that Leah was unloved,  so He opened her womb; but Rachel remained barren.  Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben, as she had declared, &quot;Because Yahweh has discerned my humiliation, for now my husband will love me.&quot;   And she conceived again and bore a son and declared, &quot;Because Yahweh has heard that I am unloved, he has given me this one also,&quot; and she called his name Simeon.  Again she conceived, and bore a son and declared, &quot;This time my husband will become attached to me for I have borne him three sons&quot;; therefore He called his name Levi.  She conceived again, and bore a son and declared, &quot;This time let me gratefully praise Yahweh&quot;; therefore she called his name Judah; then she stopped giving birth.

The reason that Leah wanted to bear children was to try to get Jacob (Ya'acov) to love her.  Remember that Jacob had been tricked by Laban into marrying Leah when it was Rachel that Jacob loved.  In several attempts to get Jacob to love her, Leah bore him children.  As we see from the Scripture above, each and every time she bore him sons, her comment after each one was that Yahweh had seen her situation and gave her a son in her circumstances. Yet the one thing that we do not see in the three instances mentioned is her thankfulness to Yahweh for being blessed with children.  It was with the last son, Judah, that she finally expressed thankfulness to Yahweh and appropriately named her son Judah which means &quot;Praise Yahweh.&quot;

Before this birth she had basically hoped that with each son she bore to Jacob he would love her but she did not express thanks to Yahweh for the blessings He had given to her, but was oriented to her own circumstances.  

Do we make the same mistake of seeing our blessings in the light of our own purposes , instead of being thankful to Him for them?   We need to have a thankful heart in all things.   Colossians 3:16-17; 1 Thessalonians 5:18
We need to stop worrying about life's problems and focus on the Source of the answer to life's problems, Yeshua!  

In the end, it was Leah who became his companion and it was she who was buried with him as his partner in the spiritual hope of Israel at Hebron.

Ya'acov the Man
When we are young we are idealistic, we would do anything for a cause and we are full of power, strength and grand ideals.  But as we age, mature, and life takes its toll on us, idealism fades and is replaced with realism.  We become more concerned with our lives and less concerned with conquering and changing the world.  Ya’acov’s father was a wealthy man. We are told in Scripture that he had many flocks, camels, donkeys and servants and it seems his son Ya’acov had an easy, carefree, idealist childhood. He was the studious type spending considerable time with the patriarchs learning the ways of Yahweh.

Ya’acov’s youthful idealism of working fourteen years for the woman he loved and six years for the flocks he wanted, mellowed him into the realities of life. In his idealism, Ya’acov’s recounts to Lavan how hard and unselfishly he worked for him,  building Lavan’s wealth and stature in the land.  But now it was over! Ya’acov had enough of idealism, it was reality he was concerned with now; Lavan had deceived him and there was nothing for him back there in Charan any longer. The fearful Ya'acov who had left his mother and father twenty years earlier with his tail between his legs had matured into a determined man.

It was only after he matured; after his idealism had faded away that we read about Yahweh once again speaking and encouraging him regarding his calling.  Yahweh sent Moshe into the back side of the desert to be a shepherd after living the life of a prince for the same reason and did not speak to him during those forty years either.  It was only after they were broken, after they matured and lost their idealistic, lofty opinions of themselves, that He began speaking to them again. He can only work with and use vessels who are serious, seasoned,  broken and matured! 

Ya’acov was ready to be used by Yahweh; his time had come, reality had caught up with him!  What comes around goes around, Ya’acov learned his lesson and he learned it the way we all have to learn our lessons, the hard way!  He was matured into a usable vessel and he was ready to be used by God.

The Return to Caanan
&quot;And Yahweh said to Ya'acov, 'Return to the land of your fathers and to your native land, and I will be with you'&quot; Genesis 31:3).
Again, Yahweh in His mercy to Ya'acov indicates &quot;He will be with him.&quot;

After his twenty years of laboring in Paddan-Haran, he makes an abrupt departure from Laban as he begins his return to the land of his fathers. After seven days of journey, Laban and his cohorts finally catch up with Ya'acov and his family.  It was told to Laban on the third day that Ya'acov had fled.  So he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him a distance of seven days, catching up with him on Mount Gilead&quot; (Bereisheet/Genesis 31:22-23).

Laban raises the issue of the teraphim which had been stolen.  The little gods were images that signified deeds of trust on the possessions of the holder.  The belief was that these images had supernatural power to protect the things they were signifying. While the idols were a form of idol worship it is important to note the value of the images, in that day.  Notice the context in Gen. 31:14-16. Rachel was complaining about not receiving any inheritance from her father so, she stole the very things that signified ownership of the inheritance.   Rachel hid the images and her father and Ya'acov make a covenant.   Genesis 31:44-46).

Ya'acov is memorializing this place on earth, with this pillar of demarcation between him and his father-in-law Laban.
 
Laban promises not to pass by the heap or pillar &quot;for harm&quot; in exchange for Ya'acov promising the same thing.  And then it appears that Laban invokes the witness and judgment of the God of Abraham, Nahor and their father Terah between them.  Then it is stated that Ya'acov swears by the &quot;Dread of his father Isaac.&quot;  He made a solemn oath or vow with Laban.   Then after the covenant is agreed to by Laban and Ya'acov, &quot;Ya'acov offers a sacrifice&quot; on the mountain.  Interestingly, this is the first time that it is recorded that Ya'acov offers a sacrifice.  Here at a relatively perilous moment in his encounter with Laban, you can begin to see the transformation that is taking place in Ya'acov.  Ya'acov is growing in his understanding of just who the Creator is and how He indeed factors into the affairs of mankind.  By invoking the witness and judgment of the God of Abraham and Isaac into the covenant, Ya'acov is admitting that He is a part of the covenant.  Then by sealing the covenant by offering up sacrifices, he is resorting to the old patterns that he had witnessed as a child and young man growing up in the tents of Abraham and Isaac.

Two Camps: The Natural and the Spiritual
As you read the story and follow the sequence of events, you can sense that Ya'acov is definitely being prepared for even greater dependency upon the Almighty.  Now that he has successfully handled the situation with his father-in-law, the two parties depart in their separate directions.  Genesis 31:55-32:2

Here, on a tributary to the Jabbok River that eventually will take his divided company to the Jordan River and back to the Land of Promise, Ya'acov has an extraordinary encounter with angels reappearing to him after twenty years.   He has set up a pillar to demarcate the spot where he and Laban have made their peace and called upon the name of the God of Abraham and Isaac to witness and judge the covenant. Then he has even followed their example and offered up sacrifices to consummate the covenant.   Ya'acov could have named the spot where all of this occurred, 'God's camp', and yet he names it &quot;Two Camps&quot;.

Ya'acov has been seasoned in the ways of Yahweh and his visitation by the angels marked the end of an era of struggling with his fleshy nature and the call on his life to be spiritual and have faith and trust in the God of his fathers.  In the visitation of the angels he sees that with his 'camp' in the natural is the overshadowing of the spiritual 'camp' of the Almighty in which he can trust.

Yahweh has so worked in Ya'acov's life to bring him to an understanding of the futility of seeking one's own way and he has come to a place where he is ready to put an end to the strivings of his flesh and trust the God of his fathers Who has fulfilled all that He promised him and brought him back to the land of his inheritance.
