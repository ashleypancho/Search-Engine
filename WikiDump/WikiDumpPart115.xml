==Phosphoproteomics==

===Introduction===
'''Phosphoproteomics''' is the branch of proteomics that deals with identification and characterization of proteins with an attached phosphate group. Protein phosphorylation is a reversible post-transcriptional modification which plays an important role in signal transduction, protein function and localization. The phosphorylation of serine , threonine and tyrosine residues is the most common in mammalian cells, whereas the phopshorylation of histidine and aspartate is rare in eukaryotes.

===Detection and characterization===
The detection and characterization of phosphoproteomics has been traditionally done with kinases, phosphatases, biochemical and genetic studies [http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/9/230]. More recently, antibodies, 2D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry are being widely used because of their ability to give specific results with high throughput. Due to the usage of mass spectrometry in phosphoprotemics analysis, there has been tremendous developments in the areas of sample preparation, instrumentation, quantitative methodology, and informatics[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2810156/?tool=pubmed].

===Applications===
The phosphoproteomic analysis of cells and tissues provide insights about cell signaling , cell differentiation status , new phosphorylation motifs , kinase-substrate specificty and number and types of protein phosphorylations. Studies on cancer phosphoproteomics might provide us with prospectice biomarkers.

'''Reviewer: Richard Rodrigues'''

====Main Focus====
;:The main focus is to give an overview about Phosphoproteomic analysis using Mass Spectrometry, current applications and the future challenges for the field .

====New Terms====
;Shotgun Proteomics:  method which involves digestion of protein mixture, peptide separation by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry to identify proteins in the mixture. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun_proteomics)
;Collisional Dissociation:  method which involves collision of an accelerated molecular ion with an inert gas molecule resulting in smaller fragments of the charged ion. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision-induced_dissociation)
;Electron-based dissociation:  method which involves capture or transfer of an electron to a charged ion to induce its fragmentation. (1: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_transfer_dissociation    2: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_capture_dissociation)
;False discovery rate:  it is a ratio of number of false positives to the sum of number of false positives and number of true positives. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate)
;Phosphopeptide enrichment:  is the isolation and concentration of peptides with phosphate groups attached for further analysis via mass spectrometry. (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoproteomics)

====Summary====
;:[[Image: L-Phosphoserine.png|thumb| ''L-Phosphoserine '']]	[[Image: Affinity-column-2010-09-04.png|thumb| ''Affinity column-chromatography '']] Protein phosphorylation plays an important role in signal transduction across species, with kinases and phosphatases accounting for 2–4% of eukaryotic proteomes. Application of the Mass Spectrometry (MS) technologies have allowed for phosphoprotein analysis in a wide variety of biological contexts, thus overcoming the limitations of traditional biochemical techniques. Uses of MS technology in different studies have revealed insight into the cells of whole organisms, the role of phosphorylation events in determining the fate of individual cells, the role of individual protein phosphorylation events on signaling networks within the cell, and identification of the phosphorylation events on protein substrates of various kinases. 

;:Phosphopeptide enrichment strategies like affinity-based approaches (immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), metal oxide affinity chromatography (MOAC), and strong cation exchange (SCX), anti-pTyr immunoaffinity methods) and other alternate approaches (BEMA (ß-elimination/Michael addition), phosphoramidate chemistry (PAC), phosphate metal affinity chromatography (PMAC) and calcium phosphate precipitation) are currently being used inline with MS to prevent suppression of unstable phosphopeptides during ionization. The tandem MS approach involves separation of a phosphopeptide mixture by capillary liquid chromatography followed by electrospray ionization (ESI) that generates multiple protonated gas-phase peptide cations. This process of precursor selection, dissociation, and fragment ion mass analysis is iterated on analyte species as they elute from the liquid chromatography column. This MS based approach helps to identify the peptide primary sequence and position of the phosphoryl modifications. 

;:Peptide fragmentation can be achieved by collision-activated dissociation (CAD), electron capture dissociation (ECD) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD). Quantitation methods like metabolic labeling, isobaric tagging, isotope tagging and isotope dilution are the widely used to produce peptides with slight differences in mass by incorporation of heavy stable isotopes. Recently, label-free approaches have also been utilized for phosphopeptide quantitation. The intensity of the mass spectral peaks is then used to determine the relative amount of the peptide in one condition versus the other. The conventional shotgun proteomics strategies applicable for phosphoproteomics involves the use of target–decoy database searching at both the peptide and protein level making possible the control of the false discovery rate (FDR) of a dataset. 

;:Various software tools are available to identify site localization (e.g. Ascore, PhosphoScore, Phosphinator and SLomo), data sharing/mining (e.g. PhosphoSitePlus, Phospho.ELM, Phosphorylation Site Database (PHOSIDA) and PhosphoPep). High-resolving power mass analysis can be used to distinguish isobaric modifications like phosphorylation and sulfonation. Ongoing developments in MS technology and related instrumentation will not only increase the large sets of phosphoproteomic data, but also increase the dynamic range and sensitivity. This will allow the detection with lower amount of samples and identification of lower-abundance phosphorylation events. Using informatics to utilize the available data and get biological insights will help in the study of phosphoproteomics.

====Relevance to a Traditional Proteomics Course====
;:The paper relates to the course of proteomics as it gives the overview of mass spectroscopy in phosphoproteomic analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Psychological profiling in team building can be a very useful tool in distinguishing personalities, traits, characteristics, strengths and weaknesses of each team member. From the beginning of time, people have had to work together and because no two people are alike, not even twins, the mind and overall psychological makeup or personality of a person can be an important aspect in building effective and productive teams.

In the early 19th century, when astronomers timed the passage of stars overhead, they noticed they all came up with different results. They took these differences and made an analysis of what they called the &quot;personality&quot; of the eye. Even as far back as the mid-1800's, distinguished scholars were championing the whole person as a unit of study. From that point forward, individual psychologists began to conceptualize personality and behavior differently.

Psychological profiling is a useful tool in the selection of a team, team alignment, personal development, coaching, and the overall team development.  A team can certainly be formed without psychological profiling; however, with the power of knowing the personality and mind of each team member better, it gives the team a head start in meshing and forming the most effective team possible.


== What is Psychological Profiling? ==

Psychological profiling is the analysis of an individual or teams behavior and psychological characteristics, used especially to identify and explain the makeup of that person or the team in question.  If the organization or team can better understand the makeup, behavior, and characteristics of the members of that team, it is more likely that those paired up will behave more congenial and have more overall cohesion within the group.

Sir Francis Galton may properly be called the first practitioner of psychological testing.  It has been said that he originated mental tests, and assumed that intelligence could be measured in terms of a person's level of sensory capacity-the higher the intelligence, the higher the level of sensory discrimination. Galton also began a long line of research on mental imagery, much of which included the first extensive use of the psychological questionnaire.  Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, James Cattell, B.F. Skinner and other great minds can also be much accredited for bringing psychological profiling to not only the individual, but to the groups or teams within organizations.  

Carl Jung's theory of psychological types says each person is &quot;wired&quot; with different tendencies and preferences.  Some of us are extraverted while others are introverted, some are &quot;thinkers&quot; while others are &quot;feelers&quot;, and so on.  Carl Jung also once said, “Personality is the supreme realization of the innate idiosyncrasy of a living being.  It is an act of high courage flung in the face of life, the absolute affirmation of all that constitutes the individual, the most successful adaptation to the universal condition of existence coupled with the greatest possible freedom for self-determination.”  In order for the team to understand the individual, the individual must also understand themselves.

Personality is often said to be the major makeup of an individual person or team’s make-up.  A contemporary definition for personality is offered by Carver and Scheier (Professors of Psychology):  “Personality is a dynamic organization, inside the person, of psychophysical systems that create a person’s characteristic patterns of behavior, thoughts, and feelings.”  Important aspects of the psychological or personality makeup may be:


*Dynamic Organization: suggests ongoing readjustments, adaptation to experience, continual upgrading and maintaining Personality doesn’t just lie there.  It has process and it’s organized. 
*Inside the Person: suggests internal storage of patterns, supporting the notion that personality influences behaviors, etc. 
*Psychophysical systems: suggests that the physical is also involved in ‘who we are’
*Characteristic Patterns: implies that consistency/continuity which are uniquely identifying of an individual 
*Behavior, Thoughts, and Feelings: indicates that personality includes a wide range of psychological experience/manifestation:  that personality is displayed in MANY ways.


Carver &amp; Scheier  also suggest that the word personality “conveys a sense of consistency, internal causality, and personal distinctiveness”.  This issue of “personal distinctiveness” is very important.  There are certain universal characteristics of the human race and particular features of individuals. We all for example experience stress and the elevated pressure that goes with it.  The real key is this though -  Every one of us is unique too.  That is why using psychological profiling can point out much of those unique points and point the team in the right direction to play on those unique points, while also meshing with the similar characteristics.


== Types of Psychological Profiling ==

There are many types or ways an organization can perform psychological profiling in building and sustaining teams.  Actual tests or questionnaires can be performed – possibly the number one way most people may think of psychological profiling.  However, there are other ways.  Psychological Profiles also known as Personality profiles can be deduced from any public information such as demographic data, internet search, media, opinions, blogs, social networking services, wikis, newsgroups, words, voice, pictures, videos, biological features, physical features, body language, forums, message boards including other methods such as statistical comparisons with peer groups. 


Factors such as how people create various usernames, emails, IM Names, the way people write, the style and method of writing, the words they use, their pictures, videos, voice, biological features, physical features, body language, their comments etc also have relevance.  This can also help to understand and estimate behavior in different social and team situations.

Relevancy of a personality profile also known as psychological profile is proportional to the accuracy of the background information you provide.  The fundamental point of profiling is comparing a subject's behavior with the behavior of others in similar circumstances who have been studied in the past.  The key to good profiling is in deducing what background effects what trait and identifying patterns. Often times what most people commonly consider to be irrelevant pieces of information could be very relevant for any trait.  It is also possible that people have a certain trait but do not act upon it due to external circumstances that make it very difficult for them to act in accordance with their natural trait. In these situations when the external circumstances are removed people revert to their natural trait.

There are no traits that are all bad or all good. Good or bad is very relative and defined according to the society one lives in or the circumstances. Certain traits in certain situations would be extremely desirable and those same traits in a different situation could be extremely undesirable. And even within the same society, concepts of good or bad may change over time, particularly if influenced by evolving societal values or expectations.

Often times people's own perceptions about their behavior, thoughts or functioning are biased by their own ideal image and experiences. Objective observers, on the other hand can provide a more unbiased assessment of these behaviors. To you your own traits, may seem perfectly normal, typical or not typical. Yet to those around you, they may seem typical, odd or abnormal. Normal is often defined by what's statistically average. Most people fall in the middle ground, the average, while others fall to one extreme or the other. And what is normal also changes over time particularly when influenced by evolving societal values or expectations.

Although there are a number of ways psychological profiling may be administered to the individual or the team as a whole, below are some major tools used by many organizations to understand the team building process better.  It is best to analyze the particular industry and business that is in need of team building and decide upon the best tool available for that organization.  One may find that not only one tool is sufficient, but may need multiple tools to understand fully and reach the goals of team building that are needed for ultimate success.  The options available specifically for teams are bolded:
 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!width=&quot;400&quot;|Personal Competence
!width=&quot;750&quot;|Social Competence
|-
|Adversity Quotient (Paul Stolz, 2000) || Similar to resilience and hardiness, the Adversity Quotient has been proposed as an indicator of capacity to withstand and thrive on challenging circumstances '''specifically related to business and the workplace.'''
|-
|Enneagram (Google search) || Personality tool based on 9 personality types.  Developed with a more deeply historical and spiritual orientation than most other similar questionnaires by some leading humanistic psychologists, including Gurdjieff, Ichazo, and Naranjo.  The types relate to the major roles that people seem to adopt and play in society.  There is no definitive Enneagram questionnaire - various free and commercial versions are available.
|-
|DiSC Management Strategies  (Corexel) || Commonly used tool and associated training program for providing feedback and improving on people's self-management and '''team management in workplace settings'''.
|-
|Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument (Herrmann, 1970's)  || The HBDI 120-item self-report diagnostic tool which provides thinking styles profiling based on left-right hemisphere preferences and cognitive vs. limbic thinking preferences.  Can also be used for '''team profiling, building, and analysis'''.
|-
|Human Synergistics (Human Synergistics International, 1970's) || A thinking style / personality profiling and feedback system, plus training program, which can be completed on an individual, team and organization level to assess strengths and areas for improvement/change in individual effectiveness.
|-
|Keirsey Temperament Sorter || Similar to the MBTI, identifies 16 personality sub-types, based on dichotomous ratings on 4 main personality factors which are derived from the psychological work of Carl Jung.
|-
|Myers-Briggs Type Indicator || The MBTI is the most widely used personality assessment questionnaire, '''particularly in workplace training'''.  The MBTI identifies people as being one of 16 overall types, based on dichotomous ratings on 4 main personality factors.
|-
|Team Management Systems (Margerison &amp; McCann, 1980's) || '''Profiles the kinds of kind of roles people prefer to play in groups and teams'''.  Provides individual and '''team-levels''' of analysis.  '''Used to help improve quality of team performance.'''
|-
|360-Degree Feedback || System for gathering feedback from others about personality and work styles which makes particular use of combining observer ratings and comparing with self-ratings.
|}


These instruments are commonly used and recommended as comprehensive personality and team profiling tools.  These tools are often used by organizational consultants, managers, individual team members,  and workplace trainers to help facilitate understanding of:


*personal strengths and weaknesses 
*other team members' strengths and weaknesses 
*a team's overall strengths and weaknesses 
*an organization's overall strengths and weaknesses



== Conclusion ==

As we have discussed in this section, psychological profiling can be a very important and useful tool in team building and maintaining effective groups.  With psychological profiling being the analysis of an individual or teams behavior and psychological characteristics, used especially to identify and explain the makeup of that person or the team in question, one may better understand the dynamics or make-up of each individual and overall team better.  

It is also imperative to remember that there are many types of psychological profiling as discussed in this section, ranging from search, media, opinions, blogs, social networking services, wikis, newsgroups, words and so forth, to actual testing, questionnaires, etc.  Testing may include such options as:  DISC Management Strategies, Team Management Systems, Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, and so on.  These tools help to not only understand the individual and the “map” they are working on, but also how these individuals will affect the team and the overall potential of cohesiveness, productivity, and possible effectiveness.

Born on january 5, 1987 &lt;u&gt;Kigali, Rwanda&lt;/u&gt;. Leaving in France since September,2006.

== Today's World as seen by Mizero ABEGA ==

[[Who?]]

Who is able to learn us, to tell us, etc thing we already learned? He is Mizero

[[Why?]]

I want and I am able. Nothing can stop me to say what I want to say!

[[When?]]

March 9, 2010

[[Where?]]

No surprise, I am writing home in my residence.

[[What is this?]]

They after we receive book all we read books, we follow the media, we go and learn to school, we learn home by our parents and our friends.

Today, I have some thing to share with you my reader. Surely, I come from no where as you've the habit, when you meet a foreign person. I'm rwandese as you saw it up.

Thanks to WikiBook to allow me a place where other people can get my thoughts and experience.

I want to talk about: the '''WORLD OF TODAY'''

Rwandese leaving in France (with my disability-everyone has an identity, disability is one). I will be talking about:
* world system
* how can we clean it?

You should not say that I am from no where. January 5, 1987 Régine Nyirankamiyimana (my mother) has given birth to me. Every time we have explanation, I was overweight compared to many newborns. Birth in these conditions means medicine was what she meant at that time( this explain my disability).

&lt;big&gt;What I want to say in few words&lt;/big&gt;

Human being (evolution).&lt;br /&gt;
* Every one has a say
* How can we listen to each other?
* ?</text>

''Acknowledgements: The meetings and staff work which facilitated the writing and compilation of this document were funded by the United Soybean Board with contributions of facilities and personnel by the University of Idaho and the US Department of Agriculture – Agricultural Research Service; and funding for some international travelers provided by the US Soybean Export Council (USSEC) and by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).''

I don't think this constitutes a copyvio (and if it does it doesn't seem to be problematic) considering &quot;''[[w:Public domain#United States law|Works &quot;prepared by an officer or employee of the U.S. government as part of that person's official duties&quot; are automatically in the public domain by law.]]''&quot; that seems to cover most of those sources and the remaining seem to be highly interested in generally promoting the use of their produces. Have you tried contacting someone ( http://www.soynewuses.org/ContactUs/Default.aspx ) ? &lt;br&gt;
If you examine the source material, you will find that most of the content comes from the public institutions listed above, it seems [[w:United Soybean Board|United Soybean Board]] just compiled existing public material without any great creative input (probably it could violate the NPOV) as United Soybean Board could have selected to aggregate the public information supportive of their interests...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:26, 8 March 2010 (UTC)
:Well, the web site hosting the document appears to claim copyright over it see [http://www.aquafeed.com/disclaimer.php disclaimer], so I think that makes it the responsibility of the contributor to put up a case for their use of the material. Plus, it is not really clear from the acknowledgments you quote whether the  work was entirely produced by public servants or also people employed by other bodies. I see that in the list of authors there are Russians, Norwegians and Israelis who presumably are not US government employees. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]])
::I don't know if the US Soybean Export Council (USSEC) and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are part of the US federal government if so by the above acknowledgment it seem they were the source of the funding for those individuals work.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:26, 9 March 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sandalwood Trade==
The sandalwood trade was started by Kamehameha I. The people that wanted to trade were the Chinese and later the English. They traded fur, tea, rum, cocoa, guns, ammo, yams, cottons, woolens, nails,  saddles, canvases, French wines, glass, harnesses, iron pots, pans, pens, paper, ink, flour, soap, rice, hemp, and animals such as goats and pigs. The sandalwood trade ended when Kamehameha I died. The sandalwood trade started up again by Kamehameha II but with lesser control. The sandalwood trade became so popular that there was less and less sandalwood. Kamehameha II ordered his people to find more sandalwood. There was so little sandalwood that Kamehameha II promised to send sandalwood to his traders. More and more foreign people came to Hawaii and brought diseases that killed a lot of his people. Kamehameha II wrote a letter to King George (King Of England) to ask for help , and that is when the sandalwood trade ended.

==Liholiho Death==

Liholiho and Kamamalu both were going on a trip to visit George IV. The couple were going to England on the British ship. Liholiho and Kamamalu left Hawai’i on the year of 1823. While Liholiho went to England, his brother Kauikeaouli ruled the land while he was gone.   It took Liholiho and Kamamalu 6 months to reach England. When Liholiho and Kamamalu arrived to England, they stayed at a London hotel. Liholiho and Kamamalu got to watch a theater performance and a balloon ascent. A month later, Kamamalu died on July 8, 1824 and Liholiho died a week later, both of them died from measles. The English people shipped the bodies back to Hawai’i. When the Hawaiian people found out that their king died every one was very sad. The next King Kamehameha III Kauikeaouli was the third child of Kamehameha.

:When learning to use git, I think it is important to have a good mental model of how git works, specifically the directed acyclic graph nature of the commit history. Instead of the Introduction section, I would start with a &quot;Core concepts&quot; section explaining the concept of a commit. Specifically, a commit represents a snapshot in time of the project as a whole, and how commits are related to each other in a parent child relationship. After the core concepts section, then launch into the basic commands (init, status, diff, add, commit), perhaps in a Getting Started section. --[[User:Haydenmuhl|Haydenmuhl]] ([[User talk:Haydenmuhl|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Haydenmuhl|contribs]]) 18:19, 27 March 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Basic introduction to the passage'''

'''Contextual notes'''

When coming in on Chapter 2 of Matthew the author skips ahead of the visit of the angel to Mary and the conception of Jesus. The end of Chapter one leads into the visit of the Magi by restating the prophecy of the messiahs coming. 

'''Structural notes'''

Chapter two is broken up into six parts:

1.	Magi arrive in Jerusalem (v.1-6)

2.	 Herod summons them (v. 7-8)

3.	 The Magi find Jesus and worship him (v.9-11),

4.	 dreams of magi and Joseph warning them (v.12-15)

5.	 Herod’s killing of the children (v.16-18)

6.	 The return to Israel then Galilee (v.19-23)


'''Chapter Synopsis'''

After Jesus had been born in Bethlehem magi from east of Judea came to Jerusalem and asked “Where is the child who was born ruler of the Jews? Was saw the star and have traveled here to worship him.” When King Herod heard them he was worried along with the rest of Jerusalem. Herod gathered all those who knew the scripture to find out where this child was to be born. They told him in Bethlehem. It was written by the prophet that out of Bethlehem the ruler over Israel will come. Herod gathered the magi and asked when the star had appeared to them then he sent them saying “Go find the child and after you have come back and tell me where he is so that I may go and worship him as well.” After this the magi left and found the star that they saw in the east and were happy. They went into the house of Mary and Joseph. When they saw the child the bowed down in worship and gave gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. After leaving the wise men were warned by God to not go back to Herod. And they returned through a different route. An angel came to Joseph in his sleep and told him to take his wife and son and flee to Egypt. They lived there until Herod was dead. When Herod realized that the magi were not coming back he sent his men out to kill all boys who were two years old and younger. After this the, prophesy that had been spoken through Jeremiah was fulfilled. After Herod died and angel came to Joseph in a dream and told him to take his family back to the land of Israel because those who wanted him dead had all died. On their way back Joseph heard that Archelaus was ruler after his father, Herod, had died and Joseph was scared. God told Joseph to take his family to Galilee and he did and they settled in Nazareth.

'''Paraphrase'''


1	After Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea while Herod was king, magi from the east came to Jerusalem asking,

2	“Where is he who is to be king of the Jews? We say his star and have come to worship.”

3	Herod heard of the Magi and what they were seeking and was afraid.

4	He gathered the chief priests and scribes and asked where the Messiah was to be born.

5	They replied “he is to be born in Bethlehem of Judea: this is what has been written by the prophet:

6	‘And you, Bethlehem, Land of Judea, are by no means least among the leaders of Judea; for out of you shall come forth a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.’

7	After this Herod summoned the magi to see when the star first appeared. 

8	He sent them on their way and told them “search for the child, when you find him come tell me so I may worship him as well.”

9	They went on their way and found where the star came to rest over the place where the child was.

10	When they saw the star they were filled with joy.

11	They saw the child with his mother Mary; they fell in adoration and worshiped him and gave their gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

12	God then warned them in a dream to not return to Herod, so the magi returned home a different way.

13	After they left and angel came to Joseph in a dream and told him to take his family and go to Egypt until it is safe.

14	Joseph woke them and they fled.

15	They stayed in Egypt until the death of Herod.

16	Herod realized he had been tricked and sent his men out to kill all boys the age of two and younger in the area of Bethlehem and around there.

17	Then Jeremiahs prophecy had been fulfilled

18	“A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children; and she refused to be comforted, because they were no more.”

19	When Herod died and angel came to Joseph in Egypt and told him,

20	“Go take the child and his mother and go to Israel; those who wanted to kill him are dead.”

21	Joseph took them to the land of Israel

22	When they arrived Joseph found out Herod’s son Archelaus was ruling and was afraid and warned by God. He left for the region of Galilee

23	They lived in the city Nazareth. It fulfilled what was said “He shall be called Nazarene.”


'''Historical context of the Magi (verses 1-6)'''

The word ‘magi’ has four general meanings 

1) members of Persian priestly class; 

2) possessors of supernatural knowledge and power. 

3) Magician; and 

4) deceiver or seducer.(Hagner2&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, Donald. World Biblical Commentary Matthew 1-13. 33a. Dallas, Texas: World Books, Publisher, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)
through the New Testament magi means a man of wisdom, with the passage in Matthew 2 it refers to astrologers. It was later after Christian influence that we call them kings and thought of only three magi because of the three gifts.(Hagner2&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, Donald. World Biblical Commentary Matthew 1-13. 33a. Dallas, Texas: World Books, Publisher, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)
When there was most likely a caravan of magi and servants. The reason we have come to call them kings is because of what the gifts were. The offering of gold and precious spices is not extraordinary but does suggest that the magi who could give these gifts were of some wealth(Hagner2&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, Donald. World Biblical Commentary Matthew 1-13. 33a. Dallas, Texas: World Books, Publisher, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)
we have also added that the three magi have names: Melchior, King of Persia; Gaspar, King of India; and Balthasar, King of Arabia. They are thought to be descendants of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

'''Verse 1'''

The Bible states “magi from the east arrived…(NASB)” this gives us four possible places that they could be from: 1) Parthia; 2) Babylon; 3) Arabia; and 4) Egypt.(add citation) To narrow this down it is most likely that the magi were from Babylon because they had to have some form of Jewish thinking. This could have occurred in Arabia or Parthia but Babylon had a settled Jewish community. (Hagner2&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, Donald. World Biblical Commentary Matthew 1-13. 33a. Dallas, Texas: World Books, Publisher, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''Verse 2'''

The magi were also gentiles, they knew of the coming king for the Jews; yet, did not know where he was to be born. This explains why they went to Jerusalem to look for him. Jerusalem was the big capital city where anyone who did not know would think that the king would be born. The only way that the readers would be able to conclude that the magi were Jewish would be if Matthew clearly stated so. 

'''Verses 3-6'''

This verse states that King Herod heard about the magi and what they were looking for and he was “troubled (NASB)” so he gathered his priests and scribes to find out where the child was to be born. These verses show Herod’s insecurities. This is not the first time Herod killed many people for political reasons including his own sons when he feared that they were plotting to kill him. (Marshall3&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Howard, A.R. Millard, J.I. Packer, and D.J. Wiseman. New Bible dictionary. 3rd ed. Downers Grove, Illinois: Intervarsity Press, 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)however this story of Herod sending his men out to kill all the small boys in not recorded anywhere else the thought of a new king of the Jews is bound to bring out Herod’s worst fears and paranoia. 

'''Verse 7-8'''

	Herod “secretly called the magi” this tells us that the magi never went to ask Herod where the child was. Even though that is what most people think. He summoned them with evil intent. This also shows how cunning Herod could be. They were in private, Herod asks them when they first saw the star to find out about how old the child should be, and he tells them to go find out more i.e. where he is and covers himself by adding “so I too may come and worship him (NASB).” (citation henry online commentary) 

'''Verses 9-10'''

	The magi left Jerusalem for Bethlehem of Judea where they came to Jesus’ house and “The star that they saw in the east went before them until it came and stood over the place where the Child was (NASB).”  There has been a lot of study into what the star was that they saw in the east. In some versions of the verse the star is seen as ‘at its rising.’ Other things that have been thought of and taken into consideration are that ‘the star’ could have been a natural phenomenon. Saturn and Jupiter were in line in 7-6 B.C. and Halley’s passed in 12-11 B.C. it could also have been a supernova.(Hagner2&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, Donald. World Biblical Commentary Matthew 1-13. 33a. Dallas, Texas: World Books, Publisher, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;) however, this verse (9) makes these a little difficult to explain because it says that “it went before them” and “stood over” the verse must be understood either as a romantic myth growing out of the historical kernel or else as referring to something actually experienced by the magi and interpreted in terms of the leitmotif of the star that first ‘led’ them from the east to Jerusalem. The real point is that by divine guidance they were able to complete their quest and find the child.(Hagner2&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, Donald. World Biblical Commentary Matthew 1-13. 33a. Dallas, Texas: World Books, Publisher, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;) some have said that the magi believed it was an Angel, some Jews believe that it was the star of Jacob. We have not been able to identify the exact star and probably never will. Marshall3&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Howard, A.R. Millard, J.I. Packer, and D.J. Wiseman. New Bible dictionary. 3rd ed. Downers Grove, Illinois: Intervarsity Press, 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''Verse 11'''

	At this time the magi have arrived at the house and saw the Child. Later in Verse 16 it states that Herod sent them to kill those who were two years and younger. Off of this it is safe to assume that Jesus was probably a toddler and was learning to walk, and was standing next to his mother when the magi arrived. 
The magi “fell to the ground and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. (NASB)” these, again, are some of the reasons Christians call the magi kings. They are very valuable and expensive gifts. One of the definitions of gold according to Dictionary.com is a precious yellow metallic element, highly malleable and ductile, and not subject to oxidation or corrosion. Gold is a form of currency, and could reflect Christ’s kingship(Hagner2&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, Donald. World Biblical Commentary Matthew 1-13. 33a. Dallas, Texas: World Books, Publisher, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;), frankincense is an aromatic gum resin from various Asian and African trees of the genus Boswellia, esp. B. carteri, used chiefly for burning as incense in religious or ceremonial practices, in perfumery, and in pharmaceutical and fumigating preparations. (Dictionary8&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt;) and is thought to describe his deity(Hagner2&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, Donald. World Biblical Commentary Matthew 1-13. 33a. Dallas, Texas: World Books, Publisher, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;). Lastly myrrh is defined as an aromatic resinous exudation from certain plants of the genus Myrrh is, esp. M. odorata, a small spiny tree: used for incense, perfume, etc. (Dictionary8&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt;)and represents his suffering.(Hagner2&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, Donald. World Biblical Commentary Matthew 1-13. 33a. Dallas, Texas: World Books, Publisher, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''Verses 12-23'''

'''Dreams/slaughter of Children/prophecies fulfilled'''

	In these next chapters there are three dreams that occur to warn the magi one to warn Joseph and the one to tell Joseph to take his family back home from Egypt. These are also the chapters where the great slaughter of young boys happens because Herod realizes that the magi were not coming back. Thus prophecies of the messiah coming out of Egypt and later Nazareth and so on come to be fulfilled. 
	
'''Verse 12'''

	This is where we first hear of God appearing and warning people through dreams, as he tells the magi “to not return to Herod” so they did not and went back via another rout. Some could speculate that the magi knew Herod was a ‘bad guy’ or would harm the boy. Herod’s reputation was pretty well known and if the magi were from a surrounding city it would be hard for them to not have heard of him. Herod probably knew of his reputation and is another reason why he added “so I too may worship him” to put the magi at ease and since he was the king of the Jews he would want to go worship the real king of the Jews.

'''Verses 13-15'''

	“An angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream…(NASB)” this is the second dream that God uses to warn his people about Herod’s wrath. Joseph is told to take the child and his mother and go to the land of Egypt and to stay there until those who want Jesus dead are themselves dead. This then fulfills what was said by the prophets “out of Egypt I called my son.” The historical exodus is not prophecy about the future. How is it then that Matthew has fulfilled one? The fulfillment is central the Matthews whole perspective. The eschatological significance, of the Christ, God’s unique son. The son of God, Israel, and the Son of God, Jesus, both in Egypt of necessity and both delivered(Hagner2&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, Donald. World Biblical Commentary Matthew 1-13. 33a. Dallas, Texas: World Books, Publisher, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;). Also note in Matthew the author does not call Jesus Josephs son. He is always referred to as “the Child” (New Interpreters4&lt;ref&gt;New Interpreters Bible. VIII. Nashville, Tennessee: Abingdon Press, Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''Verses 16-18'''

	At this time Matthew tells us that Herod has become aware that the magi were not coming beck. We are never told how long it took Herod and it is difficult to be able to know for sure. The author also uses this as another parallel to the story of Moses. First the escape to Egypt (unlike Moses escape from Egypt). The slaughter of young boys, with the demand coming from Herod instead of Pharaoh.(New Interpreters4&lt;ref&gt;New Interpreters Bible. VIII. Nashville, Tennessee: Abingdon Press, Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)The story can be interpreted and a beautiful, action, escape story. Historically Herod would not have been fooled so easy, he most likely would have sent people to follow the magi. Also Joseph, Mary, and Jesus had enough time to escape. This is when the author writes that “then what had been spoken through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled: a voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning…” Ramah is our world, when it says that the cry heard in Ramah goes to mean the voice of the world is weeping. It is not something of comfort but a way of saying that the sadness is double. Which is understandable with Herod’s “children’s Crusade.” (Buttrick&lt;ref&gt;Buttrick, George. The Interpreters Bible. VII. Nashville, Tennessee: New York Alingdon Press, 1951. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Verses 19-21'''

	After Herod died in 4 B.C.(Hagner2&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, Donald. World Biblical Commentary Matthew 1-13. 33a. Dallas, Texas: World Books, Publisher, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)God sent an angel to Joseph to tell him that those who wanted to kill the child were dead. This goes back to verse 13 at the end of the message the angel said “…remain there until I tell you…” Not only did the death of Herod mean that the ‘holy family’ could return but those who had fled from Herod. Joseph is told to take them to the land of Israel which is an echo of the exodus.(Hagner2&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, Donald. World Biblical Commentary Matthew 1-13. 33a. Dallas, Texas: World Books, Publisher, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;) Also moving forward to the next dream that told them to go to Galilee is necessary to underline the exodus typology.(Hagner2&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, Donald. World Biblical Commentary Matthew 1-13. 33a. Dallas, Texas: World Books, Publisher, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;) when the angel says “the land of Israel” it is a pretty broad area including Galilee, and Judea, it is assumed that Joseph took this to mean to go back to Bethlehem. (France7&lt;ref&gt;France, R.T. The New International Commentary on the New Testament The Gospel of Matthew. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)This explains why that is where they return to, and then are given further instructions in the next verse.

'''Verse 22'''

	When returning to Bethlehem they found out that Herod’s son Archelaus, he was ruler over Judea/Samaria, while his brother Antipas was ruler of Galilee, and Philip. Historically none of the sons were granted the title ‘king’ and Archelaus and Antipas tried to gain the title. Archelaus was not popular, even hated by some. Eventually in A.D. 6 He was removed from power. This is when Pontius Pilatus then took over. (France7&lt;ref&gt;France, R.T. The New International Commentary on the New Testament The Gospel of Matthew. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., Print.&lt;/ref&gt;) With Archelaus’ reputation it is not hard to believe that Joseph would not think it was any safer under him than it was under his father. (France7&lt;ref&gt;France, R.T. The New International Commentary on the New Testament The Gospel of Matthew. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)It was recorded by Josephus that at the beginning of his rule Archelaus killed about three thousand Passover celebrants. (France7&lt;ref&gt;France, R.T. The New International Commentary on the New Testament The Gospel of Matthew. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., Print.&lt;/ref&gt;) This could have prompted the next dream that was a vague and gave direct instructions that took them to Nazareth. 

'''Verse 23'''

	Nazareth was not a big town. It is believed to only have had a maximum of 480 in the beginning of the 1st century. (France7&lt;ref&gt;France, R.T. The New International Commentary on the New Testament The Gospel of Matthew. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)and was most likely smaller than Bethlehem. There is no talk about Nazareth in the Old Testament except for the prophecy that was to be fulfilled. (France7&lt;ref&gt;France, R.T. The New International Commentary on the New Testament The Gospel of Matthew. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., Print.&lt;/ref&gt;) It is most likely that Matthew took a collection of sayings from many prophets. “He shall be called a Nazorean” is not in the Old Testament or in any other form of literature.(France7&lt;ref&gt;France, R.T. The New International Commentary on the New Testament The Gospel of Matthew. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)it is a good probability that this thinking came from the Hebrew word nezer which means branch and sounds somewhat like “Nazareth” this all referring to the branch of the Davidic line. Matthew would have had this all in mind (New Interpreters4&lt;ref&gt;New Interpreters Bible. VIII. Nashville, Tennessee: Abingdon Press, Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)however this does not explain the “he shall be called” part. In Judges the phrase “he will be a naziraios” is used which in translation could have come to the phrasing “He will be called a Nazorean” (France7&lt;ref&gt;France, R.T. The New International Commentary on the New Testament The Gospel of Matthew. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''Word Study: “Dream”'''

	In the New Testament dreams and visions are not always clearly distinguished from one to the other. The most common word for dream in Greek is onar which is only used in Matthew.
The New Testament and Old Testament and the Greco Roman world, see dreams as the way that God chose to reveal himself. The New Testament also expresses little concern with the problem of false dreams and visions.(Freedman1&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, David. The Anchor Bible Dictionary. 2. New York: Doubleday, 1992. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)
The central message of the New Testament is Chris coming and God only goes to dreams as a secondary source and in revelation. (Freedman1&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, David. The Anchor Bible Dictionary. 2. New York: Doubleday, 1992. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Assignment Problems (AP) (also known as Allocation Problems, although they will be known as the former throughout this article) are a common form of problem. A distinguishing feature of AP is that one agent is assigned to one and only one task. Examples in real-life situations could be:

* Assigning contracts
* Assigning tasks to machinery
* Assigning agents to tasks
* Assigning Sales Personnel to Territories

&lt;br/&gt;
An example of such a problem would be three lorries, A, B and C, and three loads that need to be transported, 1, 2 and 3. An example arrangement would be A → 1, B → 2 and C → 3. This means that Lorry A transports Load 1, Lorry B transports Load 2 and Lorry C transports Load 3. 

== Balanced Problems ==

A balanced AP is one in which:

(number of agents) = (number of tasks)
{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=right width=20% 
|+ Table 1
|- style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background: gray&quot;
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;| 
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''A'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|15
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|10
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|12
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''B''' 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|10
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|7
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|11
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''C'''  
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|15
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|6
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|9
|}


Consider again our lorry and load example. In this example, the number of '''agents''' (lorries) was 3 and the number of '''tasks''' (loads to be transported) is also equal to 3. Thus, it is a '''balanced problem'''. Initially, one will consider only balanced problems and how they are to be solved.

Upon expansion of the earlier problem, it was revealed that the cost for each lorry to transport each load is different. These are represented in Table 1.

&lt;br/&gt;
The manager of the fleet of lorries wishes to minimise to total cost to complete all three jobs. How would one allocate the lorries to the loads? The table of numbers given is called the ''cost matrix'' of the problem.

=== Formulation as a Linear Programming Problem ===

A Linear Programming Problem can easily be developed for AP. One would define &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; (where agent ''i'' is assigned task ''j'') where:

:&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;=1, when agent ''i'' is completing task ''j''
:&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;=0, when agent ''i'' does not complete task ''j''

Thus, one can obtain the contraints for the Linear Programming Problem by considering each agent/task in turn:

As each agent is assigned to exactly one job, we can deduce:

:for agent A: &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; = 1
:for agent B: &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; = 1
:for agent C: &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; = 1

Similarly, since each job is assigned to exactly one agent, one can deduce:

:for job 1: &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; = 1
:for job 2: &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; = 1
:for job 3: &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; = 1

If we apply this to the aforementioned example, one can see that for lorry A, it can only carry one of loads 1, 2 or 3. So, &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt; could = 1, with &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A3&lt;/sub&gt; being zero, or &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, with &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A3&lt;/sub&gt; being zero, etc.

The obtain the ''objective function'' for this example, we must consider the total costs.

: For lorry A, costs will be: 15&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 12&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A3&lt;/sub&gt;
: For lorry B, costs will be: 10&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 7&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 11&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B3&lt;/sub&gt;
: For lorry C, costs will be: 15&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 6&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 9&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt;

The means, therefore, that the objection function, ''Z'', for this example is to minimise Z where:

: Z = 15&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 12&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 7&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 11&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 15&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 6&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 9&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt;

Finally, this means that one can conclude the LPP to be:

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;border:1px solid&quot;&gt;Minimise Z, where Z = 15&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 12&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 7&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 11&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 15&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 6&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 9&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt;, subject to:
:&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; = 1
:&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; = 1
:&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; = 1
:&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; = 1

:&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; = 1&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Solution of the Balanced Assignment Problem==

An algorithm was developed by Harold Kuhn in the 1950s, and was named the Hungarian Algorithm. Its name is a reference to Dénes Kőnig and Jenő Egerváry, a pair of prominent Hungarian Mathematicians whose techniques are applied in this algorithm. 

===The Hungarian Algorithm===

For the Hungarian Algorithm to work, the assignment problem must meet the following criteria:

*Each worker must be assigned, as we previously saw, to exactly one job.
*Each job must be assigned to exactly one worker.
*In the cost matrix, a constant can be added or subtracted from all cost values in any row or column without having any effect on the optimal assignments.

There are three stages in the implementation of the Hungarian Algorithm:

*Find the opportunity cost matrix
*Test for an optimal assignment. If one can be made, use it and stop.
*If an optimal assignment cannot be made, revise the opportunity cost matrix and return to the previous step.

To demonstrate these three steps, let us consider again the lorry example:

====Finding the Opportunity Cost Matrix====

The Opportunity Cost Matrix (OCM) is essentially a modified version of our initial Cost Matrix. In order to change the Cost Matrix into the OCM, one must carry out two stages.

# Carry out '''row reduction'''
# Carry out '''column reduction'''

Row reduction is the operation in which the smallest number in each row is subtracted from every number in that row. With our earlier example:

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=left width=20% 
|+ Cost Matrix

|}
{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=left width=20%

| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|9
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
|}

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Next, one completes the column reduction. This is the same as row reduction, only with the smallest number in each column being subtracted from each value within that column. Thus:
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=left width=20%

| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0

|}

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Thus, the completed Opportunity Cost Matrix is:

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=center width=20% 
|+ Opportunity Cost Matrix

====Interpreting The Opportunity Cost Matrix====

Since the aim of an assignment problem is to assign exactly one agent to exactly one task, one must match each agent up to the task which best minimises overall cost. After completing the row reduction and column reduction, it is logical to assume that the values that remain in the table are the minimum possible. Similarly, since the values in the table are the cost-values, the lowest values in the table are, surely, those of lowest cost. In order to find a solution, one must select one zero from each row and one zero from each column. However, one cannot select more than one value from any row or column, as it will result in one agent/task being assigned twice, which cannot occur in an Assignment Problem.


Again, let's consider the earlier example. If we were to select one zero from each column/row without any doubles occurring, the only possible solution is (with selected costs marked by asterices):

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=center width=20% 
|+ Opportunity Cost Matrix
|- style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background: gray&quot;
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;| 
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''A'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0*
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''B''' 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0*
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''C'''  
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|6
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0*
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
|}


If we then assign this solution to our original cost matrix, one can see the following:

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=center width=20% 
|+ Cost Matrix
|- style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background: gray&quot;
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;| 
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''A'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|15
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|10
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|12*
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''B''' 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|10*
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|7
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|11
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''C'''  
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|15
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|6*
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|9
|}

Thus, the final assignment is:

: A → 3 (cost 12)
: B → 1 (cost 10)
: C → 2 (cost 6)
: Z = 12 + 10 + 6 = 28

It is interesting to see that, despite this being the cheapest solution, it doesn't actually utilise all of the lowest values within the table.

===Optimality of a Solution===

An important issue with AP is the optimality of solution - when one obtains a solution, how can one be sure it truly is the best solution available? With the Hungarian algorithm, there is a fairly straightforward test for optimality that concerns drawing lines through the zeros in the Opportunity Cost Matrix. If the number of lines (horizontal and vertical only) is equal to the number of rows/columns, the solution obtained is optimal. If, however, the number of lines needed does not equal the number of rows/columns, the solution is not optimal, and can be improved. This is a somewhat perplexing technique, but one that is straightforward to implement and clear to interpret.

Consider the following OCM:

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=center width=20% 
|+ Opportunity Cost Matrix
|- style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background: gray&quot;
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;| 
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''A'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''B''' 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|5
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''C'''  
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|6
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
|}

&lt;br/&gt;
It is fairly easy to see that it would require only two lines to draw through all of the zeros - one could use a horizontal line through row B, and a vertical line through column 2, for instance. 2≠3 (the number of rows/columns), thus an optimal solution cannot be made.

Consider, on the other hand, our lorry example. Is the solution that we obtained optimal?

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=center width=20% 
|+ Opportunity Cost Matrix
|- style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background: gray&quot;
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|

|}

&lt;br/&gt;
One can see that, in order to strike through each zero, one would need three lines (for instance, one through column 2, one through row B and one through row A). 3 = 3, thus we have an optimal solution that cannot be improved upon.

====Revision of the Opportunity Cost Matrix====

In the event of achieving a non-optimal assignment, one must revise the OCM. There are several steps in this process:

#Check the costs uncovered by the drawn lines
#Identify the smallest uncovered value
#Subtract this value from all of the uncovered costs
#Add this value to any costs that are at the intersection of any two drawn lines

Take our non-optimal solution from earlier. The smallest uncovered value was one. Subtracting one from each uncovered value gives:

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=center width=20% 
|+ Opportunity Cost Matrix
|- style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background: gray&quot;
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;| 
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''A'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''B''' 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|5
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''C'''  
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|5
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
|}

Adding one to the point of intersection of the two lines (in this example, one could have drawn them through row B and column 2, therefore the point of intersection is cell B2) gives:

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=center width=20% 
|+ Opportunity Cost Matrix
|- style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background: gray&quot;
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;| 
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''A'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''B''' 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|5
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''C'''  
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|5
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
|}

Again, only two lines (this time, they must be through row A and column 3) are needed. They intersect at cell A3. The smallest uncovered value is, again, 1. So, subtracting one from each uncovered cell and adding one to cell A3 gives:

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=center width=20% 
|+ Opportunity Cost Matrix
|- style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background: gray&quot;
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;| 
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''A'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''B''' 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|4
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''C'''  
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|4
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
|}

Finally, the minimum number of lines needed to draw through all of the zeros is 3, which is the number of rows/columns. This means any assignment made will be optimal.

==Solutions of Unbalanced Assignment Problems==

The definition of a ''balanced'' AP was one in which the number of agents was the same as the number of tasks. In reality, this is unlikely to be the case - that is, it is unlikely that one would have the same number of taxi drivers to the number of customers, for example. In the event of an unbalanced problem, one must add a '''dummy''', which is a blank/empty row, added to the Cost Matrix, in order to 'balance' the rows, for the sake of the algorithm. If one had, for instance, three agents and four tasks, one would add a '''dummy row'''. On the other hand, if one had four agents and three tasks, one would add a '''dummy task'''. This helps as it means that one agent or task will be left without a 'real' assignment, as using them would increase the total cost of the assignment.

Consider the following example:

A taxi company has four drivers (A, B, C, D), each currently at different locations. Three customers (1, 2, 3) have called the taxi company and need to be driven to their destinations. The total distance that would be travelled, by the driver, is represented in the cost matrix below:

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=center width=20% 
|+ Cost Matrix
|- style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background: gray&quot;
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;| 
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''A'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|11
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|19
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|17
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''B''' 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|21
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|15
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|13
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''C'''  
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|15
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|18
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|21
|-
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''D'''  
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|18
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|15
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|17
|}

The Taxi Company wishes to minimise the total distance travelled by its drivers. Find an optimal solution to this Assignment Problem.

&lt;blockquote&gt; Solution:

Initially, one must add a dummy column, in order to make this a 'balanced' problem. Let this column be called &quot;Row 4&quot;. Since there isn't actually a fourth customer, all of the costs in this matrix will be zero. This will mean that the otherwise most expensive taxi in the matrix will result in being assigned the dummy - in other words, it won't be used in the problem.

First, let's carry out row and column reduction:

| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|4

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

As one can see, it would take only three lines (through rows A and B and column 1) to strike-through all of the zeros in the Opportunity Cost Matrix. Thus, revision is needed in order to find an optimal solution. These lines cross in cells A4 and B4. The smallest uncovered value is 3. Removing this from all of the cells covered by one line and adding it to all of the cells that are covered twice gives the following revised OCM: '''I don't have the time to fix this, but it's wrong.  In the 2nd column, subtracting 15 from 15 does not yield 4, therefore, we've already arrived at the optimal solution because 4 lines can be used to mark through the entire matrix.'''


{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=center width=20%

| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|4
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|4
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''B''' 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|10
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''C'''  
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|5
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
|-
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''D'''  
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|4
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
|}


This time, it would take four lines to strike through all of the zeros in the OCM. This means that any solution obtained is optimal. The only possible solution is:

:A → 1
:B → 3
:C → 2
:D → 4*
:Z = 11 + 13 + 18 = 42

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Of course, customer 4 is in fact a 'dummy' - i.e., D doesn't actually transport any customer. Thus, the only three drivers needed are drivers A, B and C. Driver A will transport Passenger 1, Driver B will transport Passenger 3 and Driver C will transport Passenger 2.

==Maximisation Problems==

All of the examples that have been considered so far have been Minimisation problems - in other words, they've been ones in which the aim of the problem was to minimise a cost. Assignment problems can, however, be used for the opposite reason - to maximise a gain or a profit. Consider the example of ice-cream seller. They know that, in certain towns, they will sell more icecream than others. The day, too, changes how much ice-cream s/he sells - they only drive the van on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday (M, W and S respectively). Taking into account that the ice-cream van can only visit one town at a time, which town should the ice-cream van visit on which day, in order to maximise his/her profit.

The following cost-matrix represents the earnings (in £100s) for each town (A, B, C) on each day (M, W, S):

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=center width=20% 
|+ Cost Matrix
|- style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background: gray&quot;
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;| 
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|M
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|W
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|S
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''A'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|10
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|7
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|11
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''B''' 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|10
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|12
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|12
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''C'''  
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|9
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|13
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|11
|}

If one were to carry out row and column reduction, as per usual, and then to come to a solution, it would be a solution that gave the '''minimum''' profit that the ice-cream van could make. In order to find the '''maximum''' profit, we first identify the largest value in the matrix. In this case, it is 13. We then subtract each number from 13 and assign the new number to the cell the original number was in. In other words, cell A1 (of current value 10) becomes &lt;math&gt; 13 - 10 = 3 &lt;/math&gt;.

After completing this process for the whole matrix, we achieve the following:

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=center width=20% 
|+ Cost Matrix
|- style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background: gray&quot;
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;| 
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|M
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|W
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|S
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''A'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|6
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''B''' 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|3
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''C'''  
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|4
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|2
|}

We can now carry out row and column reduction, as we usually would. This, eventually, results in the following Opportunity Cost Matrix:

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=center width=20% 
|+ Opportunity Cost Matrix
|- style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background: gray&quot;
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;| 
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|M
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|W
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|S
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''A'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|6
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''B''' 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''C'''  
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|0
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|1
|}

Since the smallest number of lines that can be used to strike-through each of the zeros in this matrix is 3 (which is equal to the number of rows/columns), an '''optimal assignment''' can be made. The only possible assignment is:

:A → M
:B → S
:C → W

On the cost matrix, this gives us:

{|   style=&quot;border:&quot;2&quot;;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=2px align=center width=20% 
|+ Cost Matrix
|- style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background: gray&quot;
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;| 
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|M
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|W
! width=25% style=&quot; border:1px solid gray;&quot;|S
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''A'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|10*
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|7
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|11
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''B''' 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|10
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|12
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|12*
|- 
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background: gray&quot;|'''C'''  
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|9
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|13*
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|11
|}

This means that:

:On Monday, the van will visit town A.
:On Wednesday, the van will visit town B.
:On Saturday, the van will visit town C.

The total profit gives:

:&lt;math&gt;Z = 10 + 12 + 13 = 35&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the maximum total profit of the ice-cream van is £3500.

==About SMU-DE==

'''Sikkim Manipal University Directorate of Distance Education''' was established in 2001 by the [[Sikkim Manipal University]] of Health, Medical and Technological Sciences as part of its efforts to bring education to the masses to fulfil the growing demand for professionals.
SMU is university in [[Sikkim]] which is joint venture in between Government of Sikkim &amp; [[Manipal Education]] to offer regular &amp; [[Distance education]] course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smude.edu.in/users/distancehome.aspx|title=Sikkim Manipal University Directorate of Distance Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accreditations/ Recognition==

The University is recognized by [[DEC]], [[UGC]], &amp; [[Ministry of HRD]] to offer program in 9 discipline. The [[Association of Indian Universities]] (AIU) recognises SMUDE conferred degrees as on par with the degrees conferred by its members.[[Sikkim Manipal University Directorate of Distance Education]] provides courses in the follwoing disciplines:&lt;br /&gt; 
•	Information Technology&lt;br /&gt; 
•	Management &lt;br /&gt;
•	Commerce&lt;br /&gt; 
•	Journalism &amp; Mass Com&lt;br /&gt; 
•	Apparel &amp; Fashion Design&lt;br /&gt; 
•	Telecom technology&lt;br /&gt; 
•	Allied Health Science&lt;br /&gt; 
•	Bio Informatics &amp; Biotechnology&lt;br /&gt;
•	Hospitality &amp; Tourism &lt;br /&gt;

==EduNxt&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;==

''EduNxt&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the next generation learning system that fully takes advantage of modern teaching techniques to create a virtual classroom where students come together to learn from distinguished faculty and each other. EduNxt&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; makes it possible for students to collaborate on team-oriented learning tasks like assignments and case studies| through audio, visual and IM aids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edunxt.smude.edu.in/|title=SMU Login}}&lt;/ref&gt;


''EduNxt&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;'' makes it possible for a student to self-learn, since self-motivation has always been a Distance Learning issue. Learners of the same course can, for example, chat with each other and faculty members in real time to clarify their doubts or read faculty [[blogs]] and comment on them. The concept of mentoring means faculty members will be available as guides to hold student hand through the lonely process of self-study.&lt;br /&gt;

==Features of EduNxt&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;==

==Eddie&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;==
To simplify technology and make it fun to study, [[SMUDE]] has introduced Eddie&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;. Eddie&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; is the education buddy. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smude.edu.in/edunxt|title=Eddie}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Eddie&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; is the new cute kid on the block! Goofy, amiable and lovable, he believes that being a smart team player is more important than being a hard single player. Eddie&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; is always on the move and wants his studies to be flexible, convenient and accessible. He is here to tell students in their own language how they can use, have fun with and learn with EduNxt&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Core 4 (C4) ==

This A2 module is the fourth and final '''core''' mathematics module in the series. C4 requires knowledge from previous core modules (such as differentials from C3), and is assessed in a single 90 minute paper consisting of approximately 7 questions. The module consists of 6 main topic areas:

'''•Partial Fractions'''
# Addition and subtraction of algebraic fractions
# Splitting of a fraction into partial fractions
# Use/revision of algebraic division for improper fractions

'''•Binomial Expansion'''
# Binomial Expansion when n is a fraction or a negative number
# Binomial Expansion for (k+...) instead of (1+...) by taking out a factor of k
# Use of partial fractions to produce the Binomial Expansion of more difficult expressions

''In this topic, earlier C2 work on the Binomial Expansion is developed to include expansions involving fractions and negative numbers. Questions often require expressing problems in partial fraction form first.'' 

'''•Co-ordinate Geometry'''
# Use of parametric equations (using the parameter t) to define co-ordinates of points on a curve and solve related problems
# Conversion of parametric equations to cartesian equations
# Use of parametric equations to find the area under a curve

''Parametric equations are introduced here, and finding relationships between x and y via a parameter t is studied.''

'''•Vectors'''

'''•Differentiation'''

'''•Integration'''

&lt;math&gt; \int \sin{kx}\ dx = - \frac{1}{k} \cos{kx} + c &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \int \cos{kx}\ dx = \frac{1}{k} \sin{kx} + c &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \int \frac{1}{x}\ dx = \ln{x} + c &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \int \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}\ dx = \ln{f(x)} + c,\ \mbox{provided}\ f(x) &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;
''(this is usually resolved by taking the modulus of the f(x) result before we take the natural log of this)''






'''Note''': ''This book is so you can gain an alternative explanation for the concepts described and it should NOT replace your C4 textbook!''

      <comment>/* Pits */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Before you start any kind of online game you need to take a minute to sit down and consider some of the following questions:

#What is my game called?
#What is my target audience?
#Can I afford the cost and time of managing my own game?
#Am I good at working with people?
#What competition already exists for the game I’m going to make?
#How will my game work?

=='''It’s All In A Name'''==

A name can make or break a game. Pits of Doom isn’t anything exciting, but this is a tutorial game, not something I’ve made to produce to lots of people. Your name should be memorable, but not too hard to spell, say, or remember. Shorter names seem to work better as well, but that’s more of a personal preference.

=='''Hit the Target'''==

Many people overlook target audiences. When you design your game you need to keep in mind who actually plays your game. If your game is for young children then you don’t want a game that’s overly complex, hard to navigate through and has few images. Also take into account your audience’s familiarity with computers and the Internet. A child isn’t as likely to be able to understand complex directions or sequences whereas a hard core video game addict should have no problem navigating menus and following technical directions.

=='''Audience Tips:'''==

#Games made for ages 5-7 should have lots of pictures, big buttons, be easy to play, and have few words to keep younger children interested. There should be lots of games, puzzles, animations, and things to keep kids from getting bored. A suggestion would be using popular cartoon characters as they play the game.
#Games made for ages 8-17 should have more text, but also a lot of pictures. You want to make sure it’s easy enough for the younger players to get around and play, but hard enough to keep the interest of older players. Most games made for teenagers will automatically attract younger kids and adults at the same time.
#Adult games have more of a risk. Keeping younger players from seeing what they shouldn’t can be a hassle. One thing to keep in mind is that if younger viewers see content they shouldn’t you could be getting some very angry messages from parents of younger players. A suggestion would be using some kind of way to make sure the player is over 18, such as needing to give a money transaction to play. For an adult game you can assume they have decent computer skills and are possibly hard core gamers. Complexity and strategy and action should play big parts in these games.
#A mix of all ages is the hardest challenge. Games have to have a mix of easy play, medium play, and hard play for all age levels. You’ll have to manage keeping the attention of all age groups. This usually happens on its own if you have a really popular game, because everyone wants to play no matter what his or her age is.

=='''Carrying the Costs'''==

Games are inherently expensive. The bigger and more popular your game becomes the more it’ll cost you to keep it up and running. Are you willing to put up the expensive of domain names, servers, bandwidth, hardware upgrades, technical support, and so forth and so on? My biggest game has over 100k members and costs me over $300 a month. just in server costs. That’s over  $3,600 a year just to keep the game online. Then you have to factor in advertising, domain names, and additional expenses such as postage and letter heads and office supplies. Will you be able to carry the costs of the game’s expenses if your game isn’t generating enough revenue to support itself? These are all really important questions. Take the time to research how much it costs to buy a domain, get hosting setup, and any other additional fees you may run into before you start.

=='''Cost Solutions'''==

Just because you don’t have a big budget, don’t let that limit you!! There are several things you can do to limit your expenses.

#Limit the numbers of members who can join your game. This will reduce your bandwidth — the amount of data passed back and forth over the internet — and will encourage your members to stay active. You can even go through and delete accounts that are inactive after a certain period of time.
#Limit how many people can play online at a single time. This isn’t the best solution, but sometimes it’s a good option if your game is popular but you don’t have many people that play online at any particular time during the day.
#Don’t expand your hosting/server needs as your costs increase. If you can’t afford it, then you can’t afford it. Make your members deal with slower response times and hangups. Not great for customer service but at least they can all play.
#Don’t advertise. I know this goes against the grain, you make a new game and you really want to share it, but I’ve found word of mouth is the biggest and best form of advertising out there. The more people that know about your game the more will want to play and the higher your expenses.
#Make your game a “friends only” game. Limit it to people you know or friends of people you know. If it’s just a game you plan on making as a hobby, something to do in your spare time, this is a great alternative.

=='''I’m a People Person'''==

Even if you aren’t planning on it, your game will generate a lot of interaction among people. People will email about problems or questions or help constantly. If you’re not great with people or you can’t be bothered then you’re in for an eye opener. A website without any kind of support doesn’t do well in the big scheme of things. Take the time to evaluate yourself. Are the benefits worth the downfalls?

=='''Overtake the Competition'''==

Is your game 100% unique? Chances are that it’s not. Take a day or two to find any other site you can that’s even a little bit similar to the game you have in mind. Join them and check them out. What are features you like? What do you dislike? The more time you spend going through your competition’s setup the more you’ll generate a feel for what you want your own game to be like, what features are a given, or could be improved upon. Knowledge is power, and giving your target audience a more useful, more enjoyable game is sure to win their approval and guarantee your popularity.

=='''Liability &amp; Legal Mumbo Jumbo'''==

Terms and conditions or terms of service are a legal agreement between you and anyone who decides to play your game. In this agreement you want to make sure that anyone who uses your website cannot sue you or take you to court!!! Every game you make should have terms and conditions. If you can afford it I highly recommend that you pay a lawyer to write them for you or review what you’ve written up yourself. If not you can take use a copy of the terms and conditions I’ve drawn up for Pits of Doom at the end of this tutorial as a starting point for your own game. Listed below are some general things I would recommend thinking about or including in your terms. Please note this is not legal advice and any tips below are no substitute for getting a lawyer whose familiar with current online practices and laws.

=='''Protect Yourself:'''==
#Make sure you state that by using your website your visitor is legally tied to your Terms and Conditions. This means that they accept them as legal document.
#Make sure you remind your visitors that any changes made to your Terms and Conditions are in place immediately. You don’t want people to tell you they never agreed to your changes.
#Don’t forget to include a statement saying that your visitors can’t hold you responsible for any kinds of fees or losses as a result of using your website. This includes computer problems, buying products off your website, game fees, etc.
#If you make people pay to access your game then you should have a section describing your refund policy – even if you don’t give refunds, tell them that. A refund means you’ll give someone his or her money back. For example if someone paid you twenty dollars and asked for a refund you’d give them their twenty dollars back.
#Be extra careful to protect yourself from things members may put up on your game. Include something saying you’re not responsible for any links, explicit or harmful text/pictures, services or products displayed on the site by members, third parties (people outside members), links and advertisements.
#Remind site visitors that you’re not responsible for any information they share or give out to other members or other places found through your website.
#Mention that visitors post content on your site at their own risk. This lets them know they’re responsible for their own actions.
#Describe your cancellation of accounts. This means you write out why you can delete or ban someone’s account and for what reasons. For example, you can include that if someone cheats or breaks a rule then you can delete their account. If your visitors are paying to play you might want to tell them they can or cannot get their money back for having their account deleted or banned.
#Always have rules. Rules state what is and is not acceptable on your website. Make sure you include harassment, rude or nasty comments, server abuse, emails, etc.
#Add anything else you need that I didn’t mention. Your terms and conditions should be your lifeboat when you’re drowning. Everything you need or think you need should be on board. If you’re not sure if you should add something or not, add it. They can be as long or as short as you want, but it’s always best to be safe now instead of sorry later.

==='''Privacy Policy'''===

A privacy policy lets your members know how you’ll be using any information you ask them. For instance, if you asked a member for their address and telephone number when they joined you might have plans to call them or send them regular mail. Some people don’t like this and others are fine with it. In your privacy policy you should tell people how you plan to use the information they give you when they join your game. So in the example above you would say that if members give out their telephone number they’ll receive phone calls, and if they give out their home address they’ll receive mail. This way people know exactly what happens to the information they give you.

==='''Laws You Should Know About'''===

There are several Internet laws you should concern yourself with if your game is based in the USA. Reading them isn’t an option of whether or not you feel like it, they are a must read. If your game is based outside the USA you’ll need to research yourself to see what rules and regulations you have to comply to.

If your game allows children you need to read the COPPA act. This concerns the privacy of personal information you may gather from children under the age of 13, how it must be stored, and who can have access to it.

Whether your game allows children or not you need to read the Digital Millennium Act. This is one of the largest and most important laws that pertains to you as an Internet game. It outlines things from playing music from current artists on your website to allowing members to upload pictures, videos, and any other content. Knowing about the DMA will protect you from copyright infringement lawsuits which will become one of your biggest concerns as your members generate their own content using or interacting with your game.

Some other minor laws include the Internet Tax Freedom Act and the Communications Decency Act both of which are fairly self explanatory from their names.

=='''Business Licenses'''==

Most counties of USA states require you obtain a business license if your game is generating over x amount of revenue a year. Usually you’re charged based on your annual income and the fee’s are fairly minimal if your game is making less than $10,000 a year. You can usually get an application from your local chamber of commerce or county treasury. You will typically be charged once or twice a year.

==='''Sole Proprietor vs LLC'''===

A sole proprietor is one person who owns an entire business or service. If your game is just a hobby chances are you’ll never need anything else other than this. All revenue you make from your game must be claimed on your personal income tax and your tax return will be calculated as if it was a part of your typical salary. In most states you don’t have to report additional income unless it exceeds $5,000 but you’ll need to check your state laws to confirm that.

An LLC, or limited liability company, is the other option. It separates you from your game and removes the chance that someone can sue you as an individual. Instead they must sue the game itself which means there’s no possibility you could loose your house or car or property. If your game is making more than $5,000 a year in revenue an LLC or something similar should be in the works.

==='''Copyrights'''===

Inherently anything you make yourself is automatically copyrighted by you, even if you never file copyrighted paperwork or register a trademark. However in a legal case having a certified copyright is a must.

A copyright is easy and fairly cheap to file.  You can do it online now through the Electronic Copyright Service. It costs about $35 per copyright and takes anywhere from 6-8 weeks to have it approved. Once the copyright is approved you’ll get an official letter with a copyright identification number. Now you have a legal document verifying you hold the copyright to your game.

A copyright filed after January 1st, 1978 for a single author will last for the life of the author plus an additional 70  years. A copyright filed for joint authors will last until the life of the last surviving author plus 70 years. If you ever decide to sell your game you can easily transfer your copyright from you to the new legal owner.

==='''Trademarks'''===

These are a bit tricky. I wouldn’t ever try and register a trademark without a lawyer, there are just too many inns and outs and little things you have to know about. A trademark costs anywhere from $275 to $325 depending on the classes you register it for. As your game gets more popular a trademark will ensure you own all legal rights to name branding, products and any additional services that arise as your game grows.

The biggest problem with trademarks is trying to find a unique name. If your trademarked name sounds too much like other trademarked names it will be denied. If your trademark is spelled differently by phonetically sounds the same it will also be denied.

Trademarks are expensive but well worth it as your game expands and grows. You can file trademarks electronically at the Trademark Office.

==='''Gambling &amp; Gaming'''===

This might not seem like something you’d think about as you’re developing a game but it is something you need to be aware of. If you offer “pay for play” gaming where your members will win prizes as a result of playing your game this is considered gambling. Gambling is defined as playing a game for money or property, or betting on an uncertain outcome.

In many states gambling is illegal without a proper license. In some states it’s illegal period. If your business model is considered gambling you’ll need to make sure you can get a license for it. Then you also run into the problem of making sure that you only have members from states where you have a valid gambling license. Over the Internet this is fairly hard to do.

For instance, let’s say you have a legal gambling license in West Virginia where your business is based. Your website attracts individuals from all over the United States. Someone from Virgina signs up and starts playing your game. Almost all forms of gambling in Virginia are illegal unless sanctioned by the state itself. Now you have someone illegally gambling on your website which could lead to future complications for yourself.

So how do you get around it? Simple, you don’t. Charging money for your game cannot be tied to winning any kind of prize or property. That means you could charge members for something completely non-related to a prize you’re giving out, or allow both paying and non-paying members to have an equal chance of winning the prize. If a member doesn’t have to pay anything in order to win a prize then it’s not considered gambling.

=='''Gears &amp; Cogs'''==

Now it’s time to set your brain into motion. Write down the biggest features you want to include in your game. Then go ahead and break it down into smaller pieces. This will help you express all of your ideas before you start making anything and should increase the usability of anything you end up making.

=='''Putting It All Together — Pits of Doom'''==

Here is something I’ve thrown together to give you an idea of the thought process I went through when coming up with the Pits of Doom game.

I chose a really generic name for this game simply because it’s a tutorial on making your own online game. Here are some names I might consider if this was a game I was making as a serious revenue earner:

    Black Abyss

    Infinity Nights

    Dark Haven

The target audience for this game is boys between the ages of 12-18. That means they’re all in middle school or higher. They’re probably used to seeing shoot em up/slasher video games by this age. Most of them have a fairly high computer usage skills at this point, but some of them are young enough to struggle. That means my navigation and layout should be simple to a point, but maybe the game play can be much more complicated.

Some similar online fighting games are:

games.swirve.com/utopia/ - an online strategy game. I find this one to be way too complicated for younger players. It has some great ideas, but it’s a bit overwhelming when you go in to play for the first time.

www.elveron.com – what do you think about this one? Follow the link and ask yourself, what do I like, what don’t I like? What could be done better?

weewar.com

kdice.com

Now write down some similarities you saw. What about the differences? Things that are similar in all games are probably features you’d want to strongly consider having yourself, or to some variation. Those are things that have made these games popular.

This game isn’t ever going to go up on any of my servers except for this tutorial code, so it won’t cost me much of anything to maintain. Can’t afford the cost of having a game online but still interested in learning how to make one? No problem, all you have to do is download and install XAMPP. Now you can run the game right on your own computer at home. Once it’s installed you can setup a database and get busy. Need more help getting XAMPP up and going? Try this tutorial.

Finally, I took the time to define the features I’ll be adding to the game and broke them down:

==='''Game World'''===

Each map in the game is called a map node.

There can be an unlimited number of map nodes in the world.

==='''Map Nodes'''===

Each map node has a name, a description.

Each map node can have unlimited coordinates.

==='''Coordinates'''===

X, Y, Z value.

Has 1 object associated with it.

Wall value:

        * 0 = open, they can move to that coordinate
        * 1 = there is a wall here

Has 1 transfer node associated with it, detailing that moving to this coordinate will force the user to move to that coordinate on the new map node.

Has a level associated with it, detailing that moving to this coordinate will force the user to move up or down one level.

==='''Item Objects'''===

G = gold (random amount each time)

T = treasure

S = sword

A = armor

L = lantern

O = oil

H = shield

C = enemy creature/monster

X = pit, chance of them dying, or draining all magic, or dropping to a lower level

T = health tonic

M = magic potion

S = store where they can buy items

L = ladder, you can climb up or down to another level

==='''Characters'''===

These are owned by members.

They have a name, gender, and breed (monster, human, elf, dwarf, centaur, fairy).

When the members is online, they are always associated with an active coordinate.

They can equip items and use them to help their statistics.

The more they play the higher the character’s statistics go.

Characters can fight other characters and monsters in the game.

If a character kills another character then they get to keep all of the items the character they killed had equipped and any gold they’d collected in the past 20 minutes.

Characters can trade items with each other if they’re both on the same coordinate.

====Statistics====

Health

Speed

Intelligence

Strength

Agility

Fighting Level

Magic Level

Magic Amount – how much magic they have they can currently used

Weapon Equipped

Spell Equipped

Armor Equipped

Shield Equipped

==='''Members'''===

Has a username, login, and password.

Keeps an email to send them password information.

Keeps track of when they are online or offline so it can activate their character.

Starts off 500G

It costs 100G to create a character.

Members can trade in gold for better weapons, however they must get the character to a store first.

When a member is online all of their characters are active in the game.

Members can trade any item they have among their own characters even if they aren’t on the same coordinate.

As soon as a member logs off or closes the game window all of their characters go inactive unless they are currently being fought by another character or attacked by a monster.

==='''Mail'''===

Members can send messages to other members in the game.

==='''Messageboard'''===

Members can post on a community message board.

==='''Best of the Best'''===

Top members and characters in the game.

Oldest characters in the game.

Strongest characters in the game.

==='''Game Objective'''===

The objective of this game is to navigate around the game world and gain prestige for your characters by keeping them alive as long as possible.

The more characters you have the easier it is to explore the world but the harder it is to keep all of them alive.

Pits are one of the biggest hazards in the game, they continuously drop you to lower and lower levels. The lower you are on any map the harder the monsters are to defeat.

==='''Pits'''===

If you run into one of these you will have one of these random possibilities:

Die

Lose all your money

Lose your best item

Lose all your magic strength

Lose all your value in 1 statistics area

Have one value in your statistics areas cut in half

Be teleported to a random location on any map

Drop down to a lower level (if there is one).

==='''Monsters'''===

These are automatically generated by the game. The further down you are on any map the harder they are to defeat but the bigger the reward for killing one.

==='''Player Movement'''===

You won’t be able to tell if you’ve hit a wall, a pit, or an empty space until at least one of your players has explored the map already. That means you have to visit the entire map before you can see what the map looks like from a top down view. This makes it more exciting as you won’t know what you’ll find until you go there.

Phew! That’s a lot but this is actually a fairly straight forward and small game. I’m sure you can already think of a hundred different things you would or could add to it from what I’ve described already.

Now, you’re ready to start learning how to make this game.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the best things to do if you’ve never made a game before or you don’t have much programming experience is to break things down into their most basic parts. We’ll start off making this game by doing some really really simple programming and then adding functionality until the game is complete. It doesn’t look like much now, but at the end of this tutorial you’ll be able to download a fully working version with an installation file that you can use under the GNU public license to modify and edit as you wish.

The last thing I want to mention is the teaching style I’ll be using throughout all of the lessons in this tutorial. I’m big on letting people try things on their own before I give them the answer. Pretend you’re asked to take a history test. If I was to just hand you an answer sheet with all the right bubbles filled in you’d never learn anything from the test. This is a theory I hold to. In each of the lessons in this tutorial you’ll find two versions of every file I’ve made. One file will have no code in it. That way you can try to program this game from scratch by yourself. But if that’s too daunting don’t worry. The other version of the file will have all the working code inside of it.

Even if you’re not a programmer I encourage you to try your hand at programming each lesson. I’ll go over some of the basic concepts you’ll need to complete the programming before concluding with the reasoning behind what I’ve done so far.
Lesson Concepts

==About PHP==

PHP is a server side programming language. That means any code you write on any PHP file will never be visible to anyone who goes to a file with php code on it. The benefits of this are you don’t have to worry about people stealing any code you’ve written. When someone views a PHP page, all they see is the HTML or text you’ve generated with PHP or typed onto the page yourself.

PHP files have a .php extension. A lot of people I’ve talked to take that to mean PHP files cannot display HTML or Javascript. That’s incorrect. The .php extension is the server’s way of knowing it needs to evaluate any PHP code on the file before the person requesting the page sees it.

The biggest draw back with PHP is that it’s a server side programming language. That means any time you want to make a change to what the user sees on the page they either have to refresh it, or navigate to a new page. Websites where you see changes applied immediately (google mail, wordpress, to name a few) use something called AJAX. AJAX is an asynchronous relay between a server and a user’s browser. This means they don’t have to refresh the page to see changes. If you’re interested in something like that then this tutorial is still the one for you. PHP is often used in combination with AJAX to create more dynamic web pages. However, I won’t go over any AJAX in this tutorial, so once you’re done making this game you’ll need to find some AJAX tutorials.

==Printing to the Screen==

All PHP code is delimited by a start and end php tag that looks like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?php
echo “Hello World!!”;
print “Hey there!”;
echo “&lt;b&gt;WOW!!&lt;/b&gt;”;
print “This is sooooo neat…”;
?&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The PHP start and end tags are lot like matching HTML tags. If you don’t have any HTML experience I strongly recommend you take some of the tutorials on lissaexplains.com before you continue with the lessons here.

If you don’t have the correct start and end tags that would be one reason why someone could see your PHP code on the screen. Without the PHP tags the server doesn’t have any way to know what you’ve typed needs to be evaluated as PHP.

In the code above you’ll also see print and echo statements. It doesn’t really matter which one you use, but this is how you print something to the screen. Notice on the third print statement there is HTML in the quotation marks. There is nothing wrong with putting HTML inside of your PHP, in fact that’s one of the great things about it.

A few syntax things to keep in mind:

1. You always need matching start and end &lt;?php ?&gt; tags.

2. PHP statements always end with a semicolon ;

3. When you echo something to the screen it should be inside of single or double quotation marks

4. If you need to put quotes in your print statements then you should escape it like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?php
echo “And he said \”Hi Mom, how are you today?\”&quot;;
?&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The backslash tells PHP to evaluate the quotation mark as text and not as the end of the string.

5. You won’t see an error in PHP until you go to view the page. That’s because php is only evaluated on runtime. Sometimes this is very frustrating, and you’ve probably seen error codes before. If you get an error message read it, it usually tells you what you did wrong in your code.

==Common PHP Errors &amp; Solutions==

'''Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_STRING in [file location] on line [#]'''

This means you forgot a ” or a ‘ somewhere. There should always be at the start and end of a string. If you have a matching pair, make sure you don’t have one too many. If you have quotes inside of your string then you need to escape them using a backslash like this: \” or \’

'''Parse error: syntax error, unexpected ‘}’ in [file location] on line [#]'''

This means you have some kind of multi-line statement and you either forgot a bracket or having too many brackets. Brackets always come in pairs. Sometimes it mean you’re missing a semicolon at the end of the previous statement.

'''Parse error: syntax error, unexpected ‘”‘ in [file location] on line [#]'''

This means you probably forgot a parentheses before of after the DOUBLE quote. Sometimes it could also mean that you forgot to escape the double quote.

'''Parse error: syntax error, unexpected “‘” in [file location] on line [#]'''

This means you probably forgot a parentheses before of after the SINGLE quote. Sometimes it could also mean that you forgot to escape the SINGLE quote.

'''Parse error: syntax error, unexpected ‘;’ in [file location] on line [#]'''

This means that you’re missing something before the semicolon at the end of your statement. Usually its a closing parentheses. However, it could also mean you have a semicolon in a position PHP is not expecting one to be in. That usually happens in loops.

'''Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_EXIT in [file location] on line [#]'''

This means you forgot a semicolon before an exit; call

'''Parse error: syntax error, unexpected $end in [file location] on line [#]'''

This usually means you forgot a semicolon or your function isn’t returning like it should be.

==Variables==

In PHP a variable is defined by a $ dollar sign. That means any word with a dollar sign in front of it will usually be evaluated for some other kind of content. The easiest way to think of a variable is to think about a jar. You can put things into a jar and take things out. You can stick a name on a jar but then decide you want to change that name later. Variables also work this way.
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?php

//this is a comment, comments are for you
//they aren’t processed as code
//get into the habit of leaving comments for yourself so if you come back later
//you can remember what you did or what you were trying to do

$myvariable = “Hello”;
$mysecond = ” World!”;

echo $myvariable;
echo $mysecond;

print “&lt;br&gt;”;

echo “$myvariable $mysecond&lt;br&gt;”;

$myvariable = 2;

echo $myvariable;
?&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
In this example I have two variables. You can assign them a value using the equal sign. Variables in PHP are dynamic. That means you can assign them to one type (a string) and then reassing them to another type (an integer) without any kind of conversion. If that just went right over your head, don’t worry. All you really need to know is the syntax to assign a variable.

==If-Else Statements==

Games are all about decision making and that’s the benefit of a programming language. In order for anything to work in this game we’ll have to set it up to follow the rules and logic I briefly outlined in Lesson 1. To do this we need to respond differently based upon the choice the user playing our game makes.
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;?php

if ($_POST['button']) //someone clicked a button
{

echo “You pressed a button!”;
}
else
{
echo “You haven’t pressed a button yet. Go ahead, try it!”;
}

?&gt;
&lt;form action=”#” method=”post”&gt;
&lt;input type=”submit” name=”button” value=”Press Me!”&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

In this example you see a .php file that has a section of PHP code and then below that it has some regular HTML. The part to pay attention to is the if-else section. Here we display a different message to the user based upon if they’ve clicked on our button or not. IF the button has been pressed, the code between the brackets { } of the if section will execute. Otherwise the code between the else brackets will execute. I’m sure you can already see the power of PHP in this one example. If you’d like more help with If-else statements and some more examples of if-else statements read my tutorial here. This covers some PHP programming concepts more in depth and gives more examples.

==Form Basics==

A form is one way to get information on what the user is doing back and forth to the server and PHP. All forms must have a start and end &lt;form&gt;&lt;/form&gt; tags. In order to submit any information from a form to the server you MUST have a submit button. Without a submit button you won’t be able to tell the page that the user is trying to send you data about what he/she is doing. You can see a small form in the example above. It has both the start and end form tags, as well as a button. If that looks unfamiliar to you then you really should go back to lissaexplains.com and do some catching up on your HTML skills!

==$_GET and $_POST Variables==

In order to get data from a form PHP stores two special variables for us. The variables get data depending on the type of METHOD used in the form. If you look at our example above, we use a POST method. That means all the names and values of our form are sent to the server and stored inside of the $_POST variable. That way we can pull information from those variables to see if a user clicked a certain button or link. In the example above, we’re checking to see if someone has clicked on our submit button that we’ve named button (yay for generic names!). If we’d called our submit button BOB and didn’t change the if statement to check for $_POST['BOB'] then we’d never see the words telling us we’d pressed the button. As far as PHP is concerned, we no longer have a submit button called button so there’s no way it will ever be pressed.

==Summary==

There you have it. I’ve not covered in brief (and sorry if it’s not brief enough for you — or too brief!!) all of the major concepts in the first part of the tutorial files you can download below. Again, if you’re up for the challenge, try programming this file yourself by opening the character2.php file. At the top of the page it will outline everything I’m trying to accomplish in this particular file for this lesson. If you just want to see some working code then download character.php and jump right into the next lesson.

==Game Files (click to view)==

[http://design1online.com/examples/lesson2/character.txt character.php]

[http://design1online.com/examples/lesson2/character2.txt character.php (no source code)]

You’ll need to copy/paste the source from one of these files and give it a .php extension for the last part of the tutorial to make sense. All of these files are viewable as .txt files so you can see the PHP code inside of them. If they were .php files you wouldn’t ever be able to see the .php code. Do you remember why?

==Lesson Reasoning==

A lot of the logic behind the game we’re going to make has to do with movement of a character around the game world. Remember there is a difference between a member and a character. A member is an actual person who will login and play this game by the time we’re done. A character is something the member will use to navigate the game. Each member can have multiple characters.

Character.php is from the point of view of one character. Each character will be faced with the option of which direction they can move — left, right, forward or back. Every time a character moves we’ll need to evaluate the move and take some action depending upon the new location they’ve moved to.

Although this file only checks for a single direction and places the “treasure” in one specific location, it’s a step in the right direction. With this file we know which direction has been selected, we can compare that direction to the new position they’ve moved to, and we can print a message on the screen indicating if the character won or lost based upon finding the treasure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the last lesson we covered how to make a form, check to see if a button has been pressed, and display a message according to whether the user found the treasure or not. Now it’s time to take our very simple navigation page to the next level: random treasure location.

In our final game, the position of the treasure will be pre-determined by data in our database. However, we won’t know what position the treasure is in as the user is navigating their character around the game because this information will be loaded as they play.

In our next lesson we’re going to apply a more advanced concept to figuring out if the treasure is in the correct location. Instead of always knowing where the treasure is, we’re going to make the treasure start in a random direction each time the page is loaded. That way we have to check every time to figure out where the treasure is, and if the player will fall into a pit or not.
Lesson Concepts

==Functions==

In programming, a function is a great way to break bigger tasks into smaller more manageable pieces, or reduce the need of having to write the same piece of code over and over again. In PHP the syntax for a function is very simple:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?php

function myfunction ($parameter1, $parameter2)

{

echo $parameter1 . ” ” . $parameter2;
}

?&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is a really simple function called myfunction. It takes two parameters and simply echoes them on the screen whenever you call it. The periods you see in the echo statement are a way to concatenate or join the two variables together with a space in between them.

Calling a function is just as easy as making one. Anywhere you want myfunction to print something on the screen all you have to do is:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?php

echo “Hey there, here is what myfunction has to say: “;

myfunction(“Hello”, “World!”);

?&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you were to run this you’d see: Hey there, here is what myfunction has to say: Hello World! Not only can a function print to the screen, it can return values you can then store into variables. Let’s take a look at this function:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?php

function Mod5 ($number)

{

return $number % 5;
}

?&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

This function takes any number you give it and mods it by 5. If you aren’t familiar with the modulus operator, all you need to know is that it returns the remainder from the division, and not the number you’d get if you divided $number by 5.

Now let’s see what how we’d use a function that returns a value instead of printing it on the screen:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?php

//declare our function
function Mod5 ($number)

{
return $number % 5;
}

if ($_POST['number']) //they’ve entered a number
{

echo “Your number is: ” . $_POST['number'] . “&lt;br/&gt;”;

$number = myfunction($_POST['number']); //we store the modulous of what they entered back into the number variable

echo “Your number % 5 is: $number”;
}
else //show them a form to enter a number

{
?&gt;

&lt;form action=”#” method=”post”&gt;

Please Enter a Number: &lt;input type=”text” name=”number”&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;input type=”submit” name=”submit” value=”submit” /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;?php
} //don’t forget to close our ELSE statement
?&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

In this example we’ve taken the number a user enters into a text box and then display the number back to them along with the remainder of that number when it’s divided by 5.

One of the great things about PHP is that it comes with a huge collection of pre-defined functions you can use when you program. You can take a look at all the functions by going to php.net. The one function I want to touch on in this lesson is the random function.

As you can probably tell, you don’t always need to know all the little specifics that go on inside of a function as long as it always gives you the results you’re expecting. The same goes with the random function. I could go into details on how it takes the current time on your computer and does a bunch of mathematical stuff to it — but that’s just plain boring!

The short of it is, the rand function takes 2 parameters. The first parameter is the lowest number you want it to generate when it runs. The second number is the highest number you want it to generate when it runs. So, if you wanted a random number between 1 and 4, including the numbers 1 and 4 you’d do this:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?php

echo “My random number is: “ . rand(1, 4);

?&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

View the page with this php code. Now refresh the page. You’ll notice the number is constantly changing.

One other function you’ll need to know is the unset() function. This function is great, you pass it a variable or an object (don’t worry, we’ll get to those later) and it sets the value of that function to null. Think of it as taking a jar of cookies, opening the lid, and dumping all the cookies on the ground. That’s essentially what the unset() function does.

Congratulations, you now know how the rand and unset functions work. You’ll need both of these for this lesson!

==Sessions==

Now one of the biggest problems we run into is how to keep track of a user’s past responses. Or how to keep track of anything about the user from one page to another. That’s where sessions come in. Sessions are a way to track information about the user as they go from one page to another. Eventually we’ll be using information from the database to track a lot of the moves a user is making with their characters, but we’ll still need to know who the member is as they go from page to page. For right now, we’ll use sessions to keep track of the direction the user picked. And now, instead of letting the user continue to pick a direction after they’ve fallen into the pit we’re going to give them a game over message until they decide to reset the game and try again.

Sessions are very easy to use. They work almost exactly like the $_POST and $_GET variables you can use to access information about what someone has entered on to a page. However, there’s a few major differences:

   1. You can set the values of the $_SESSION variable
   2. Session variables remain with the user until you tell them to expire, they don’t change page by page.
   3. Session variables can be set to expire so they don’t last forever, or you can set them so they never expire and DO last forever.

Using sessions now will get you familiar with them before the programming becomes more complicated.

If you’ve done anything with cookies before then sessions will be a breeze for you. Sessions are a good alternative to cookies because if a browser has cookie functionality turned off you will still be able to keep information about a user from one page to another. If that went right over your head don’t worry, it’s not essential to this lesson.

There’s one thing you have to keep in mind about sessions. In order to use a session you have to call a special function at the top of every php page, BEFORE YOU DO ANY KIND OF OUTPUT!! This last is important. If you try to output anything before calling the session_start() function you will get an error.

Now let’s setup a simple session. Create two pages, one called welcome.php and the other called main.php. Welcome.php is an example of a web page you might see that greets you and asks you what your name is. Main.php is an example of a page you might look at after you’ve visited the welcome.php page.

In welcome.php we have this:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?php
session_start(); //the first thing we do is start our sessions

if ($_POST['name']) //they entered their name in the form
{
$_SESSION['name'] = $_POST['name'];

//now we’re going automatically to redirect them our next page
//using a function called header() that’s built into PHP
header(“Location: main.php”);
exit;
}

?&gt;
&lt;form action=”#” method=”post”&gt;

Enter your name for our first session variable! &lt;input type=”text” name=”name” /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;input type=”submit” name=”submit” value=”All Done!”&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now, inside of main.php we’re going to put this:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?php
session_start(); //we have to start our session again to get the data we saved before

echo “Welcome to the main menu “ . $_SESSION['name'] . “!”;
?&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the main.php file we pull out the information we stored in the session variable for name and print it back out on the screen. Nifty! Now we know, no matter which page this user goes to from now on, as long as we call session_start() we’ll be able to access their name from the variables $_SESSION['name'].

Congratulations! You should now understand the basic concept of sessions.

==Summary==

In this lesson we learned about how to make our own function and talked about how PHP has it’s own predefined functions we can use to make our life a whole lot easier. I talked about how to make a function print something on the screen versus a function that returns a value. Functions that return a value can also be printed on the screen, but you’d have to put an echo in front of the function call to do that.

Next we talked about sessions. Sessions are a way to store data as the user moves from page to page around your website. Without sessions we wouldn’t be able to tell who was who as multiple people will eventually load this game and try to play it. Right now we’ll be using sessions to keep track of a game being over or not, but eventually we’ll only use sessions to keep track of which user a person is as they play.

==Game Files==

[http://design1online.com/examples/lesson3/character_v2.txt character.php]

[http://design1online.com/examples/lesson3/character2.txt character2.php (no source code)]

Note: these are text files so you can copy/paste all the source code.
Lesson Reasoning

In this lesson character.php now has the treasure starting at a random location. If the user picks the incorrect location they get a game over message instead of being able to pick a direction again. In order to play again the user has to click on a reset button to start the game all over again. I’ve introduced functions, sessions, and a more abstract checking.

Once we start pulling information from the database we won’t know anything about the character’s current location at runtime other than their x,y,z coordinates and the map they’re on. Information about items in that position will all have to be tested each time the character tries to move somewhere. By introducing the treasure in random locations we start to get into the habit of checking information about our location as we select a particular direction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Chorus====

The Chorus is a group of actors that together speak, sing, and dance in one body. The Chorus is part ritual part thematic device that play a much larger role in Greek Tragedy than in the other genres. One of the primary functions of the chorus is to provide atmosphere and, in some ways, underscore the tragic action. When the hero is treading upon major conflict or leading us into the rising action of the plot, the chorus, in a way, are heralders of inevitable disaster and instill a sense of fear or suspense in the audience. In some ways the Chorus can represent the audience's ideal response to the play. Nietzsche feels that the Chorus, and it's chants and songs, helped the audience better connect with the character, revealing the essence of the tragedy.

In early tragedies the Chorus was dominant. They could be used to fill time when the one main actor went off-stage to change roles or for scene changes. The Chorus could sometimes have as much as half the lines in a single show. In Aeschylus' plays, the Chorus could even serve as the protagonist or antagonist.

There is a disagreement among historians as to the actual size of the standard Chorus. Some say it started at 50, then changed to 12 with Aeschylus, then to 15 with Sophocles and Euripides. Those who say the Chorus was always as small as 12 or 15, believe that the 50 Chorus members were divided amongst the four plays with which the author was competing. This helped reduce the cost of a production. Sometimes the Chorus could be as small as three people, or there could be a second Chorus.

The Chorus usually entered with a stately march, sometimes singing. Although, they could enter from multiple directions. Onstage formation would consist of three to five member lines. While the Chorus sung and danced in unison, there could be two groups that took turns. They would exchange dialogue with the characters, sometimes as individuals. When it came to acting, the members of the Chorus would respond appropriately to the situation.

Old Comedy Chorus had 24 members and had approximately two semi-choruses. One of each gender. Chorus in comedies could have mixed genders and were more active. In dramatic form, The Chorus did not enter until after the prologue and stayed onstage for the entirety of the show.

Training of a Chorus was probably spread over the 11 months the playwright had with the Chorus before the performance. At first, it was the author who choreographed the Chorus, but as time went on this job was taken over by professionals. Some say this training was similar to that of athletes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Quantization of Energy ==

If we speak of the energy being transfered in some subatomic process as being 'quantized' we mean that it is not a continuous smooth transfer but rather it occurs in many small (discrete) steps.

The Unified Field Theory as it is being formulated here states that there is no matter in the universe, and that the little itsy bitsy jig saw puzzle pieces of matter which are said to constitute the building blocks of big matter do not actually exist. Rather the universe consists of atoms which are nothing more than little magnetic field bubbles. 'Matter' should be understood as merely an interpretation of the human brain as it interacts with energy fields.

It is because the Unified Field Theory proposes that an electromagnetic explanation must be formulated to explain the properties of the atom, and it is because the Unified Field Theory rejects 'elementary mass particles' composed of some kind of 'frozen energy' that has taken solid form, that it is required that a new theoretical understanding of the quantization of energy be formulated. According to matter based interpretations of the atom quantization of energy occurs when little particles of energy are absorbed by a charged matter particle, the electron. In the electromagnetic atom the function of an electron is merely as a 'drain hole' required to maintain the flow of current required to maintain the magnet field (since you cannot have a magnetic field without current and you never have current without generating a magnetic field - the two are inseparable). It is because the matter based interpretation of the atom considers the electron to be an 'elementary matter particle' that the role of energy absorption is assigned to this electron, for an electron is a 'negative' charged particle and therefore plays the role of the sponge that soaks up all the energy absorbed within some atom.

It is possible to begin to formulate a theory of quantization of energy in the atom without employing the services of a 'negatively charged sponge particle', such as an electron, which in the electromagnetic atom already has an assigned function, that of the drain hole attached to some faucet in the nucleus.

Now it is quite possible that falling in a gravitational field occurs in quantized discrete steps, and if we examine the interaction of the atom with its surrounding environment we can get some idea as to why this might be true.

quantize.gif quantize.gif - 4439 Bytes In the image above we can see two possible scenarios where energy exchange could take place between an atom and the surrounding field energy. The atom could absorb field energy, as on the left, where the outside field is positive and the atom is negative. As the atom absorbs energy, the inner shell of the sphere quickly takes on a positive charge with respect to the rest of the atom, while at the same time it becomes neutral with respect to the outer environment, which suggests that transfer of energy would cease, since energy is only transferred where there is a potential difference in the level of energy (a voltage differential). The voltage differential now exists within the sphere of the atom itself, and following the principle that voltage differences are never allowed to exist in an energy field without the result being a flow of current to even out the field strength, we could then expect the energy to be absorbed by means of the inner current flow within the atom, with the result being that the area at the bottom would once again be negative with respect to the outside environment, resulting in one more discrete infusion of energy, with the cycle of small step by step infusions of energy into the atom continuing until the atom is neutral with respect to the energy level of the outside environment.

With this thought in mind we could imagine that the process of falling in a gravitational field (whether the direction is up or down) assumes the form of discrete step by step oscillations, wherein the transfer of energy is quantized, and it is the fact that these oscillations occur so quickly and on such small scales that falling appears to be a smooth continuous function, when actually it was a quantized function and occurred in steps.

The same principle would apply to emissions of energy by an atom, as in the image on the right, where an atom emits energy into the outside environment, and then the thin layer around the atom emission becomes a neutral charge, which halts further emissions, until the positive spot in the external environment is pulled away from the outer shell of the atom, at which time the atom is free once again to emit energy.

No negative matter particle such as the elementary particle electron is required to explain this process of quantization of energy, since it would appear to be a charge phenomenon that is the inevitable consequence of emission and absorption between the barrier separating two non-homogeneous energy fields.

[[File:02openingSPSS04.png|center|thumb|400px]]

After clicking the Data icon, SPSS with pull up a screen called “Open Data.”  Open Data will give you option to find your data set. This can be seen in the screen shot below:
[[File:02openingSPSS05.png|center|thumb|400px]]

Browse through your directories until you find your data set, then select it and click “Open.”  Your data set should now be open:

==Opening a New Data Window==
If you'd rather enter data into a blank data file, you can create an empty SPSS data file.  To do so, once you've opened the program, click &quot;File&quot; → &quot;New&quot; → &quot;Data&quot;
[[File:03openingdatafileSPSS06.png|center|thumb|400px]]

The result will be a blank or empty data file.  You can enter data in the Data View (Chapter 4) and set variable characteristics in Variable View (Chapter 5).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Differential cryptanalysis''' is a general form of cryptanalysis applicable primarily to block ciphers, but also to stream ciphers and cryptographic hash functions. In the broadest sense, it is the study of how differences in an input can affect the resultant difference at the output. In the case of a block cipher, it refers to a set of techniques for tracing differences through the network of transformations, discovering where the cipher exhibits non-random behaviour, and exploiting such properties to recover the secret key.

==History==
The discovery of differential cryptanalysis is generally attributed to Eli Biham and Adi Shamir in the late 1980s, who published a number of attacks against various block ciphers and hash functions, including a theoretical weakness in the Data Encryption Standard (DES).  It was noted by Bamford in ''The Puzzle Palace'' that DES is surprisingly resilient to differential cryptanalysis, in the sense that even small modifications to the algorithm would make it much more susceptible.

In 1994, a member of the original IBM DES team, Don Coppersmith, published a paper stating that differential cryptanalysis was known to IBM as early as 1974, and that defending against differential cryptanalysis had been a design goal.&lt;ref name=&quot;coppersmith&quot;&gt;
{{cite journal |last = Coppersmith |first = Don |year = 1994 |month = May |title = The Data Encryption Standard (DES) and its strength against attacks |journal = IBM Journal of Research and Development |volume = 38 |issue = 3 |pages = 243 |url = http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/383/coppersmith.pdf |format = PDF }} (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;
According to author Steven Levy, IBM had discovered differential cryptanalysis on its own, and the NSA was apparently well aware of the technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Levy |first = Steven |authorlink = Steven Levy |title = &quot;Crypto: How the Code Rebels Beat the Government — Saving Privacy in the Digital Age |publisher = Penguin Books |year = 2001 |isbn = 0-14-024432-8 |pages = 55–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
IBM kept some secrets, as Coppersmith explains: &quot;After discussions with NSA, it was decided that disclosure of the design considerations would reveal the technique of differential cryptanalysis, a powerful technique that could be used against many ciphers. This in turn would weaken the competitive advantage the United States enjoyed over other countries in the field of cryptography.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;coppersmith&quot;/&gt;
Within IBM, differential cryptanalysis was known as the &quot;T-attack&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;coppersmith&quot;/&gt;, or &quot;Tickle attack&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Blaze, sci.crypt, 15 August 1996, [http://groups.google.com/group/sci.crypt/msg/5cd14a329372cc5a?dmode=source Re: Reverse engineering and the Clipper chip&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- not the solidest of cites --&gt;

While DES was designed with resistance to differential cryptanalysis in mind, other contemporary ciphers proved to be vulnerable. An early target for the attack was the FEAL block cipher. The original proposed version with four rounds (FEAL-4) can be broken using only eight chosen plaintexts, and even a 31-round version of FEAL is susceptible to the attack.

==Attack mechanics==
Differential cryptanalysis is usually a ''chosen plaintext'' attack, meaning that the attacker must be able to obtain encrypted ciphertexts for some set of plaintexts of his choosing. The scheme can successfully cryptanalyze DES with an effort on the order 2&lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt; chosen plaintexts. There are, however, extensions that would allow a ''known plaintext'' or even a ''ciphertext-only'' attack. The basic method uses pairs of plaintext related by a constant ''difference''; difference can be defined in several ways, but the eXclusive OR (XOR) operation is usual. The attacker then computes the differences of the corresponding ciphertexts, hoping to detect statistical patterns in their distribution. The resulting pair of differences is called a '''differential'''. Their statistical properties depend upon the nature of the S-boxes used for encryption, so the attacker analyses differentials &lt;math&gt;(\Delta_X, \Delta_Y)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta_Y = S(X) \oplus S(X \oplus \Delta_X)&lt;/math&gt; (and &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; denotes exclusive or) for each such S-box &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. In the basic attack, one particular ciphertext difference is expected to be especially frequent; in this way, the cipher can be distinguished from randomness. More sophisticated variations allow the key to be recovered faster than exhaustive search.

In the most basic form of key recovery through differential cryptanalysis, an attacker requests the ciphertexts for a large number of plaintext pairs, then assumes that the differential holds for at least r-1 rounds, where r is the total number of rounds. The attacker then deduces which round keys (for the final round) are possible assuming the difference between the blocks before the final round is fixed. When round keys are short, this can be achieved by simply exhaustively decrypting the ciphertext pairs one round with each possible round key. When one round key has been deemed a potential round key considerably more often than any other key, it is assumed to be the correct round key.

For any particular cipher, the input difference must be carefully selected if the attack is to be successful. An analysis of the algorithm's internals is undertaken; the standard method is to trace a path of highly probable differences through the various stages of encryption, termed a ''differential characteristic''.

Since differential cryptanalysis became public knowledge, it has become a basic concern of cipher designers. New designs are expected to be accompanied by evidence that the algorithm is resistant to this attack, and many, including the Advanced Encryption Standard, have been proven secure against the attack.

In [[cryptography]], '''linear cryptanalysis''' is a general form of [[cryptanalysis]] based on finding [[affine transformation|affine]] approximations to the action of a [[cipher]]. Attacks have been developed for [[block cipher]]s and [[stream cipher]]s. Linear cryptanalysis is one of the two most widely used attacks on block ciphers; the other being [[differential cryptanalysis]].

The discovery is attributed to [[Mitsuru Matsui]], who first applied the technique to the [[FEAL]] cipher (Matsui and Yamagishi, 1992). Subsequently, Matsui published an attack on the [[Data Encryption Standard]] (DES), eventually leading to the first experimental cryptanalysis of the cipher reported in the open community (Matsui, 1993; 1994). The attack on DES is not generally practical, requiring 2&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt; [[known-plaintext attack|known plaintexts]].

A variety of refinements to the attack have been suggested, including using multiple linear approximations or incorporating non-linear expressions, leading to a generalized [[partitioning cryptanalysis]]. Evidence of security against linear cryptanalysis is usually expected of new cipher designs.

==Overview==
There are two parts to linear cryptanalysis. The  first is to construct linear equations relating plaintext, ciphertext and key bits that have a high bias; that is, whose probabilities of holding (over the space of all possible values of their variables) are as close as possible to 0 or 1. The second is to use these linear equations in conjunction with known plaintext-ciphertext pairs to derive key bits.

===Constructing linear equations===
For the purposes of linear cryptanalysis, a linear equation expresses the equality of two expressions which consist of binary variables combined with the exclusive-or (XOR) operation. For example, the following equation, from a hypothetical cipher, states the XOR sum of the first and third plaintext bits (as in a block cipher's block) and the first ciphertext bit is equal to the second bit of the key:

&lt;math&gt;
  P_1 \oplus P_3 \oplus C_1 = K_2.
&lt;/math&gt;

In an ideal cipher, any linear equation relating plaintext, ciphertext and key bits would hold with probability 1/2. Since the equations dealt with in linear cryptanalysis will vary in probability, they are more accurately referred to as linear ''approximations''.

The procedure for constructing approximations is different for each cipher. In the most basic type of block cipher, a [[substitution-permutation network]], analysis is concentrated primarily on the [[S-box]]es, the only nonlinear part of the cipher (i.e. the operation of an S-box cannot be encoded in a linear equation). For small enough S-boxes, it is possible to enumerate every possible linear equation relating the S-box's input and output bits, calculate their biases and choose the best ones. Linear approximations for S-boxes then must be combined with the cipher's other actions, such as permutation and key mixing, to arrive at linear approximations for the entire cipher. The [[piling-up lemma]] is a useful tool for this combination step. There are also techniques for iteratively improving linear approximations (Matsui 1994).

===Deriving key bits===
Having obtained a linear approximation of the form:

&lt;math&gt;
P_{i_1} \oplus P_{i_2} \oplus \cdots \oplus C_{j_1} \oplus C_{j_2} \oplus \cdots = K_{k_1} \oplus K_{k_2} \oplus \cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

we can then apply a straightforward algorithm (Matsui's Algorithm 2), using known plaintext-ciphertext pairs, to guess at the values of the key bits involved in the approximation.

For each set of values of the key bits on the right-hand side (referred to as a ''partial key''), count how many times the approximation holds true over all the known plaintext-ciphertext pairs; call this count ''T''. The partial key whose ''T'' has the greatest absolute difference from half the number of plaintext-ciphertext pairs is designated as the most likely set of values for those key bits. This is because it is assumed that the correct partial key will cause the approximation to hold with a high bias. The magnitude of the bias is significant here, as opposed to the magnitude of the probability itself.

This procedure can be repeated with other linear approximations, obtaining guesses at values of key bits, until the number of unknown key bits is low enough that they can be attacked with [[brute-force attack|brute force]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Stereotypes==

Stereotypes are general assumptions individuals hold against other individuals of a different socioeconomic or characteristic group.  Those who appear different than us are most generally stereotyped under another more or less fortunate grouped based primarily on image; most generally wrongfully categorized.  For instance different cultures base a lot of creditability of another country based upon what they may see in the media; this is never quite as it seems.  Where did stereotyping come from? 

==History of Stereotypes==


Prior to a discussion and analysis of stereotypes, it is important to recognize if stereotypes exist in society.  Many experts argue that stereotypes are developed at an early age influenced by family friends and social surroundings.  For example, if an individual grows up with minimal exposure to a certain minority race, then the media plays a more crucial role in shaping that individual’s perception of that minority race.  Stereotypes tend to exist when there is a limited or no mixing of different cultures within ones socioeconomic surrounding; also referred to as the unknown culture.  Some experts believe that stereotypes are “are actually a neverending chain of thoughts.”&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia, “Stereotype” Theories (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stereotype) Retrieved 2010-02-07, pp 3.&lt;/ref&gt;    It is an inherent cultural ignorance that disposes individuals to misconceived perceptions. 

Those misconceived perceptions can have a negative and positive impact on one’s life.  Negative impacts exist where “If one group may assume the other group is deceitful and aggressive, they themselves will respond in a deceitful and aggressive manner, leading the opponent to respond in the like, thus confirming the initial group's perception creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.”&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Heidi, Beyond Intracability.Org, “Stereotypes/Characterization Frames” October 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Negative stereotyping can lead to those being discriminated against to feel less accepted, thereby creating an innate disruptive behavior and creating feeling of lower self-worth.  Such low emotion creates in an individual “feeling of inferiority and lower self-worth.”&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Jane, “Blue Eyes Brown Eyes Exercise”, (http://www.janeelliott.com/workshop.htm) Retrieved 2010-02-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Positive impacts occur where there is an increase in moral and performance because the individual feels they are part of an accepted group. 

Stereotypes have traditionally been defined as “something conforming to a fixed or general pattern, a standardized mental picture that is held in common by members of a group representing an oversimplified opinion, prejudiced attitude, or critical judgment.”&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary. “stereotype” (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/stereotype) Retrieved 2010-2-14&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotypes were first branded by Firmin Didot as a term for printing, creating a duplicate impression, original typographical impression.  However, they were later associated with pictures in people’s heads of one’s perception of what is right and what is wrong.  Stereotypes tend to be exaggerated beliefs about specific social groups or types of individuals.  We develop our stereotypes from a sense of learned perception from family, friends, religion, and the media.  These stereotypes we possess are “standardized, simplified conception of groups based from prior assumptions.”&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia, “Stereotype” Etymology (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stereotype) Retrieved 2010-02-07, pp 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotypes have been classified into two groups: inter-group and out-group.  Inter-group stereotypes are those “where personal identity and self-esteem are derived from groups to which they belong or can identify.  They are more normal and superior.”&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia, “Stereotype” Dynamics (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stereotype) Retrieved 2010-02-07, pp 1.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, out-groups have been defined as “less attractive, outcasts or all other groups generally seen as inferior to inter-groups.&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia, “Stereotype” Dynamics (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stereotype) Retrieved 2010-02-07, pp 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stereotypes have continued to endure during the passage of time.  Stereotypes will constantly persist until people are better educated about the differences between groups and cultures. Some experts feel that stereotypes are influenced by the government and will continue to exist as we continue to “divide and conquer”.&lt;ref&gt;Enrolled Mohawk Native, Yahoo Answers. “Why do stereotypes continue to exist?”, (http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090308155312AAn3QPK) Retrieved 2010-02-14.&lt;/ref&gt; With the high influence that the media puts on socioeconomic cultures, stereotyping will continue to exist so far as those in less diverse geographical areas rely on what outside influences they receive regarding various cultures.  The fear of the unknown is what drives the existence of stereotypes. Stereotypes continue to be generated from individuals who fear others that are of a different race or culture, the unknown.  The fear of the unknown, also referred to as the “Non-uniformity, tends to create misunderstanding.”&lt;ref&gt;Shields, C.J., Harris, K., (2007).  “Technology Education: Three Reasons Stereotypes Persist”. Purdue University. Volume 44. Number 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, “the competitive aspect of human nature supports the innate need to prove oneself more worthy than another.   The differences between people make it easier to compare to one another.”&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Tammy. “Why racists still exist” Helium Society &amp; Lifestyle: Ethnicity and Gender. (http://www.helium.com/items/160035-why-racists-still-exist) Retrieved 2010-02-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Until society can learn to be more tolerant of those that are different, stereotyping will continue to exist.

== Problems Caused By Stereotypes ==

A number of problems tend to develop from the assimilation of stereotypes in society. Stereotypes cause various problems that impede the proper functioning of teams. One such problem is group divisions. Demographic characteristics such as age, ethnicity and gender are “easily observable and team members use them to attribute specific patterns of thought, attitudes and behaviors to themselves and others.  Some suggest that most people are attracted to, and prefer to be with, others who are demographically similar to themselves.”&lt;ref&gt;Darnold, Todd C., Kim A. McCarthy and Anne S. York.  “Teaming in Biotechnology Commercialisation: The Diversity-Performance Connection and How University Programmes Can Make a Difference.” Journal of Commercial Biotechnology Vol. 15, Issue 1 ( Jan 2009): 3-11.  (Darnold 5).&lt;/ref&gt; Group divisions tend to cause “harmful divisions within organizations because of the lack of coordination and support.”&lt;ref&gt;Diekmann, Kristina.  “The Power of Inter-Group Relations” Lecture.   Professor and David Eccles Faculty Fellow, Dept. of Management, University of Utah.&lt;/ref&gt; An additional problem caused by stereotypes is missed opportunities. A perceiver of a situation assumes that the target possesses the same characteristics of other members of the target’s category stereotype and incorporates those attributes into his or her impression of the target.  By attributing attributes, the “perceiver places the target into a category, thereby possibly missing out on the target’s real strengths.”&lt;ref&gt;Kulik, Carol T., Elissa L. Perry, and Loriann Roberson. “The Multiple-Category Problem: Category Activation and Inhibition in the Hiring Process.”  Academy of Management Review Vol. 32, Issue 2 (Apr. 2007): 529-548.  (Kulik 529).&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, successful managers are viewed as more similar to men than to women on attributes considered critical to effective work performance such as leadership ability, self-confidence, objectivity, forcefulness, and ambition.  Essentially, “women are not believed to possess the qualities essential for success in management positions, possibly causing companies to miss out on promoting women to important management positions.”&lt;ref&gt;Block, Caryn J., Madeline E. Heilman, Richard F. Martell and Michael C. Simon.  “Has Anything Changed? Current Characterizations of Men, Women, and Managers” Journal of Applied Psychology Vol. 74, Issue 6 (Dec. 1989): 935-943.  (Block 935).&lt;/ref&gt; The last problem caused by stereotypes is a negative impact on employees and the employee's performance. When managers who are prejudiced against certain groups allow those prejudices to influence how they treat employees, “the prejudice becomes institutionalized and affected individuals become systematically disadvantaged.”&lt;ref&gt;Kulik, Carol T., and Loriann Roberson.  “Stereotype Threat at Work.” Academy of Management Perspectives Vol. 21, Issue 2 (May 2007): 24-40.  (Kulik and Roberson 26).&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has shown that stereotypes can have a negative impact on employee feelings and behavior, inhibiting the employee from performing to the best of his or her abilities.  Stereotypes also “make employees work harder, but not better.  In sum, when stereotypes are present, performance declines.”&lt;ref&gt;Kulik, Carol T., and Loriann Roberson.  “Stereotype Threat at Work.” Academy of Management Perspectives Vol. 21, Issue 2 (May 2007): 24-40.  (Kulik and Roberson 26).&lt;/ref&gt; The stereotype threat describes the experience of a person who is aware of a stereotype about his or her identity group suggesting shortfalls in performance on the given task.  This awareness can “have a disruptive effect on performance.”&lt;ref&gt;Kulik, Carol T., and Loriann Roberson.  “Stereotype Threat at Work.” Academy of Management Perspectives Vol. 21, Issue 2 (May 2007): 24-40.  (Kulik and Roberson 26).&lt;/ref&gt; Making salient negative stereotypes about both black and white athletes has the potential “to cause poorer athletic performance relative to when they perform an athletic task in a positive or neutral evaluative context.”&lt;ref&gt;Darley, J.M., C. Lynch, M. Sjomeling, and J. Stone.  “Stereotype Threat Effects on Black and White Athletic Performance” Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 77 (1999): 1213-1227. (Darley 1224).&lt;/ref&gt;

== How to Identify Stereotypes in Team Members ==

Stereotypes can affect all individuals in a team.  Two common stereotype issues that individuals may succumb to are stereotype threat and social identity theory.  Stereotype threat has been defined as “A fear individuals experience when they are at risk of confirming a negative stereotype that is held about their group.&quot;  Steele and Aronson in this definition are referring to any group that an individual may identify with i.e.:  gender, religion, ethnicity, etc.”&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Stereotype Threat.&quot; International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. Thomson Gale. 2008. HighBeam Research. 10 Feb. 2010 &lt;http://www.highbeam.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of factors that cause stereotypes to affect individuals in a team.  The person must view themselves, or be viewed by others as a high performer.  The individual feels as though others in the team have high expectations for their performance.  In addition, the individual must have a strong identity with the stereotyped group. This person must also “be in a situation where others might question their abilities.”&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A psychological effect of stereotypes.(3 COUNTERING STEREOTYPES BY CHANGING THE RULES).&quot; Regional Review. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. 2005. HighBeam Research. 10 Feb. 2010 &lt;http://www.highbeam.com&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The last factor is that “those individuals who are most easily affected are those who expect discrimination or who believe that a stereotype is legitimate.”&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Stereotype Threat.&quot; International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. Thomson Gale. 2008. HighBeam Research. 10 Feb. 2010 &lt;http://www.highbeam.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stereotype threat can affect individuals, but it is difficult to identify.

There are several effects caused by stereotype threat. One effect can be the self-fulfilling prophecy.  The self-fulfilling prophecy exists where “Individuals identifying with a stereotyped group are so concerned that their actions will have negative implications concerning everyone in the group.  This stress can inevitably affect their performance which brings on the results they most hoped to avoid.”&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A psychological effect of stereotypes.(3 COUNTERING STEREOTYPES BY CHANGING THE RULES).&quot; Regional Review. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. 2005. HighBeam Research. 10 Feb. 2010 &lt;http://www.highbeam.com&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, studies have shown that stereotyping in teams “can limit working memory and self monitoring capabilities.”&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Stereotype Threat.&quot; International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. Thomson Gale. 2008. HighBeam Research. 10 Feb. 2010 &lt;http://www.highbeam.com&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another common problem with stereotypes in groups is social identity theory.  The social identity theory has been defined as “Individuals gain their identity from the groups to which they perceive membership.”&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Social Identification.&quot; International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. Thomson Gale. 2008. HighBeam Research. 15 Feb. 2010 &lt;http://www.highbeam.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Factors that are attributed to the social identity theory include “Individuals define themselves by the social groups to which they belong then they work to elevate themselves  further by drawing comparisons between their group and those not in the group.  This is called in-group vs. out-group.”&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Social Identification.&quot; International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. Thomson Gale. 2008. HighBeam Research. 15 Feb. 2010 &lt;http://www.highbeam.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The effect that the social identity theory has on teams is that “By classifying people as in group/out group this leads to discrimination of members of the out group.”&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Social Identification.&quot; International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. Thomson Gale. 2008. HighBeam Research. 15 Feb. 2010 &lt;http://www.highbeam.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Teams will suffer if individual team members do not treat each other with respect and accept each person’s differences.

== Managing Stereotypes ==


There are various ways to ineffectively manage stereotypes.  One ineffective way of managing stereotypes is through stereotype inhibition. While individuals who were motivated have been “shown to make fewer stereotype connections in situations in which they would otherwise activate stereotypes,”&lt;ref&gt;Frograss, Joseph P., Simon M. Laham and Kipling D. Williams. Social Motivation: Conscious and Unconscious Processes. Cambridge University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; it can actually “lead to increased stereotyping, as a rebound effect leads to more increasing after stereotypes were suppressed.”&lt;ref&gt;WBodenhausen, Galen V., C. Neil Macrae and Alan B. Milne. &quot; Saying &quot;No&quot; to Unwanted Thoughts: Self-Focus and the Regulation of Mental Life.&quot; Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 1998 Vol 74: 578-589.&lt;/ref&gt; An additional ineffective way of managing stereotypes is through increasing familiarity.  The Intergroup Contact Theory proposed by Gordon W. Allport in 1954 stated that interpersonal contact could reduce stereotypes.  However, contact alone is not sufficient because “individuals not conforming to stereotypes will be rejected from the category and placed in a sub category.”&lt;ref&gt;Hamburger, Yair. “The Contact Hypothesis Reconsidered: Effects of the Atypical Outgroup Member on the Outgroup Stereotype.” Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 1994 Vol. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Anxiety and threat levels can increase prejudice, while additional goals, such as equality among the different groups, common goals, and a lack of competition, can “lead to intergroup friendship and structured optimal contact, thereby leading to the best results.”&lt;ref&gt;Pettigrew, Thomas F. and Linda R. Tropp  A META-ANALYTIC TEST AND REFORMULATION OF INTERGROUP CONTACT THEORY February 2010 http://www.iq.harvard.edu/files/iqss/old/PPBW/tropp.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective methods to manage stereotypes include mental imagery, where recipients using counterstereotypic mental imagery were able to reduce implicit stereotypes.  By stopping implicit stereotypes from happening, the judgment or stereotypical behavior is avoided.  Preventing the implicit stereotypes from occurring “halts the suppressing of stereotypes which can lead to the rebound effect.”&lt;ref&gt;Blair, Irene V.; Jennifer E. Ma, and Alison P Lenton. “Imagining stereotypes away: The moderation of implicit stereotypes through mental imagery.” Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. 2001 Vol 81(5): 828-841.&lt;/ref&gt; Perspective taking is an effectively proven method to manage stereotypes.  The process of taking another’s perspective to focus on situation constraints and influences are helpful in explaining their behavior without resorting to stereotypes. This helps other groups to “become part of your own in-group and leads to more positive associations with the group.”&lt;ref&gt;Galinsky, Adam D, and Gordon B. Moskowitz. “Perspective-taking: Decreasing stereotype expression, stereotype accessibility, and in-group favoritism.” Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. 2000 Vol 78(4), 708-724.&lt;/ref&gt; An additional method of effective management of stereotypes is superordinate goal.  When two groups have stereotypes towards each other, the introduction of a superordinate goal that depends on both groups for success has been shown to lead to cooperation, reduced friction, and changed attitudes toward the out-group. Friendships “were also formed with members of out-groups.”&lt;ref&gt;Muzafer Sherif, “Superordinate goals in the reduction of intergroup conflict.&quot; American Journal of Sociology, 1958: 63, 349-356.&lt;/ref&gt; The last effective method is to eliminate stereotype threats.  Studies have shown that introducing negative stereotypes can lead to poor performance.  Social identities become active when stereotypes are available and apparent.  By eliminating stereotypes and introducing positive associations, overall team performance can be improved.

==Conclusion==
Stereotypes have been a part of our culture since the beginning of time.  They will continue to exist indefinitely.  The true test would be how do we continue to create a better worldly understanding of the differences between each other?  By recognizing the personal stereotypes we hold against each other and how we ourselves are being stereotyped, we can begin to understand one another and better communicate our beliefs and positions more clearly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This textbook, ''Foundations of Constructivism: A Guidebook for Educators'', is initiated as a collaborative writing project for a Webster University graduate course on the Foundations of Constructivism. 

The edition of this textbook was developed in the Spring 2010 semester. The instructor is Dr. Roy Tamashiro. The 8 graduate students in the course were the primary authors, editors, and quiz builders. 

The aim of the course was to learn ''about'' the theory, research and applications of constructivism  by ''doing'' constructivism in the course. The development of this WikiBook was the primary methodology for reading about constructivism, dialoguing about it, and applying it to other teaching / learning situations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation in a Group and Team Environment ==

Motivation can be the determining factor for the level of success a team achieves.  In most cases, a successful team/group will have been motivated from start to finish.   There are some basic “laws of motivation” that need to be understood to maximize and keep a team motivated to achieve. 

==='''Laws of Motivation'''===
#&lt;u&gt;An individual has to be motivated in order to motivate others&lt;/u&gt;:  A person cannot expect to motivate others if he/she is not individually motivated.  To successfully evaluate what is needed to motivate others, it is pertinent to consider the type of person that might motivate you.  Is this the type of person that might arrive before anyone else, who is enthusiastic, positive, always has some sort of good news to pass on, is loyal to the group, and leads by example?  As a member of a group, each person cannot expect to move the other members of the group to be motivated if he/she not motivated him/herself.  If in a group dynamic, there is not a single individual that has motivation to perform or to complete the purpose of the group, that group is destined to fail.  Richard Denney states in his book, Motivate to Win, that “if you want to motivate another person, you have to be motivated yourself.”
#&lt;u&gt;Motivation requires a goal&lt;/u&gt;:  Without a specific goal in mind, it is impossible for a group or team to be motivated.  Although they might feel motivated, without a specific reason for working or something they are working towards, their motivation serves little purpose.  Richard Denney points out that although this may seem like common sense, it is common sense that is not commonly recognized.  He also points out that motivation is about striving towards the future and without a goal, there is no purpose.  As an example, consider a team sport where there is no competition or league that they can be a part of.  What motivation does the team have to practice and work as a team.  The goal that most team sports have is to be the best compared to their competition.  If there is no one to compete against, there is no reason to compete.  The motivation to perform is lost.  The goal to be the best compared to your competition is a vital component of the group or teams motivation.
#&lt;u&gt;Motivation, Once Established, Never Lasts&lt;/u&gt;:  Motivation should be an ongoing process.  It cannot be a once a year booster.  Groups must come together on a frequent basis to discuss their strengths and weaknesses and draw up plans of action and self-improvement for the future.  Conducting a 360-degree appraisal as a group can be one way to ensure that each member is staying focused and makes necessary adjustments to their behavior.  This gives each group or team member an opportunity to assess the performance and contribution of the other group or team members.   Group members may need to be trained on this process for it to be worthwhile, effective and motivational, but this investment can lead to more motivated groups.  Just because a group or team is motivated today does not mean that they will be motivated tomorrow.  It is important that groups and teams understand the power of motivation, understand themselves as individuals, how they feel and why they react the way they do.  Group or team members must understand what makes them happy or unhappy and what inspires them to do just a little bit more.  It is also important to understand what demotivates individuals and as frequently as possible try to take steps to prevent it from happening.
#&lt;u&gt;Motivation Requires Recognition&lt;/u&gt;:  People will strive harder for recognition than for almost any other single thing in life.  Consider a parents whose child brings home a picture that they have painted at school.  If that parent admires the picture, shows it to other members of the family and pins it up on the wall, they have now motivated that child and may begin to see more pictures. A genuine compliment is a form of recognition and it takes a thoughtful person to give another a compliment.  Small-minded people are unable to recognize the achievements of others.  
#&lt;u&gt;Participation Motivates&lt;/u&gt;:   It is vital to get people involved and to seek their opinions.  When working in groups or teams it is important that an environment is established that gives each group member an opportunity to express and share their ideas.  People who are listened to and are given an opportunity to actively participate, are more effective and are more motivated.  Julian Richer, founder of hi-fi retailer, Richer Sounds, says that when he started his company 100 percent of the ideas came from him.  Now, 90 percent of how the company is run, including its systems and procedures, comes from his people.  All members of his staff are required to give 20 ideas per year for improvement.  For each idea they are rewarded a minimum amount, that increases based on the value of the idea.  Every idea presented is given a response within three days indicating why the idea could not be implemented or whether further action would be taken.  The consequence of this was a steady stream of innovation, but even more important is that Richer Sounds has an incredibly high staff retention rate.  There is usually a list of people waiting for a vacancy.
#&lt;u&gt;Seeing Progression Motivates&lt;/u&gt;:  When individuals progress as a group, moving forward and achieving, they will always be more motivated.  When they are going backwards and not making progress, people are naturally less motivated.  All members of the group must learn from the past, but realize that they cannot change it.  Instead, they must turn it to their advantage and learn from it.  Learning to focus on the slightest progress, whatever it may be, allows a team to stay motivated.  This law must be used, worked on, managed and planned in order to maintain a high level of motivation.
#&lt;u&gt;Challenge Only Motivates if there is a Potential to Win&lt;/u&gt;:  If targets for results are set to high, they may actually have a de-motivating effect.  If the consensus of the group or team is that the targets are out of reach or impossible to achieve, de-motivation will be the result.  Competitions and challenges can certainly be motivating and can inspire people to greater activity.  People will rise to the occasion.  Challenge groups or teams to get something worthwhile done and nine times out of ten they will do it.  Sometimes, the work itself is a motivator, such as responsibility, challenge or a feeling of doing something worthwhile.  One can make a person’s work more challenging by giving them the biggest job they can handle and with this responsibility must come some credit of achievement when the job is done.
#&lt;u&gt;Everybody Has a Motivational Fuse&lt;/u&gt;:   Everyone can be motivated.  Everyone has a fuse, it is just a matter of knowing how to ignite it.  At some point it may not be cost-effective to continue trying to motivate a group or team to into greater activity or performance.  It is a person’s attitude to a job that makes the difference.  A person can quite emphatically state and believe that theirs is the worst job humanity has ever created.   Yet another person taking on that same job with a different attitude will say and believe it is a great job and will consider himself or herself fortunate to have it.
#&lt;u&gt;Group Belonging Motivates&lt;/u&gt;:   People want to have a sense of belonging.  The smaller the group or team, the greater the loyalty, motivation and effort.  Extra-curricular activities can be used to draw people together.
#&lt;u&gt;Inspired Leaders are Motivational&lt;/u&gt;:   This is not necessarily a manager.  Leaders are those that inspire others to action.  Leaders are willing to take risks, are continually looking for new challenges and opportunities.  People are much more likely to be motivated when there is inspired leadership.  Leaders will defend others in their group and take full responsibility for criticism.

==='''Selected Applications of the Laws of Motivation'''===
:&lt;u&gt;Motivation requires a goal&lt;/u&gt;:  One of the first steps to motivating a group is identifying the goals and purpose of the team and making them clear from the beginning.  This first step has proven true for many group leaders and members.  Managers and non-organizer team members can see success when it is used and dysfunction and failure when not used.   For example: A branch manager of an office was charged with finding ways to cut costs and run a leaner office.  As an office his team has already gone through cost cutting procedures and that process and the results were not seen well to the team.  The goal was to break the larger group into cross functional teams of three to five members and give them time to brain storm on these ideas.  Each group would have certain rules and direction.  The team leader brought the entire group together and explained what they would be doing.  He explained the plan and outlined our goals.  In this main group they discussed the reasoning behind the goals; they reviewed the most recent P&amp;L and discussed the health of the branch.  Afterwards and over the next three days the smaller breakout sessions were completed.  The overall project had great success.  They came away with many wonderful ideas for cutting costs which were implemented in their office as well as many of other offices throughout the company.  Knowing the goals and understanding, and supporting them were huge contributing factors to the success of these particular teams. In contrast members of a team where no goal is clearing identifiable are not usually as successful.  As time passes with no overall group goal nor an understanding for the goal; each group member begins to realize and push towards individual goals.  The lack of motivation towards a common goal may break the team apart and provide minimal success.&lt;br&gt;

:&lt;u&gt;Motivation, Once Established, Never Lasts&lt;/u&gt;:  The next step to motivating a group to an acceptable level of success is determining what the group as a whole and individually needs, in order to be driven during the entire process.  Beyond providing a common goal and direction; how does a group organizer determine what will motivate her/his group to succeed?  The simple fact is that in many groups; each team member may in fact require different levels or types of motivation to push them to succeed. There are two types of motivation that exist: extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation. Extrinsic motivation is motivation that is inspired by outside forces, while intrinsic motivation is motivation that is inspired from within a person. Both types of motivation are essential to success. Below you will find different types of extrinsic and intrinsic motivational factors: 
::Extrinsic Motivation. 
:::-Bonus 
:::-Peer recognition 
:::-Good grades 
:::-Rewards 

::Intrinsic Motivation. 
:::-Happiness 
:::-Personal goals, values, and morals 
:::-Willingness and eagerness to learn 
:::-Physiological, social, and self-esteem needs &lt;br&gt;

:The best idea would be to determine prior to group organization the types and levels of motivation each group member will require.  Assigning group members to teams with similar types and levels of motivation may be beneficial in the teams overall success.  This is of course based on the types of rewards or motivators the organizer is willing to provide.  If it is just going to be one reward, the same reward for the entire group, it will be extremely important to have team members who would be happy with that reward/motivator. Determining each group members’ types and levels of motivation requires the organizer to know each member.  Both intrinsic and extrinsic motivators can be used to motivate the group.  One common device used to help understand a person and there by determine their motivators is personality testing.  Many managers find it difficult to find the time to spend with each group member individually to discover their motivators.  It would certainly be ideal if they could find the time as it helps put them on a more personable level; however even when they have the time they may find it uncomfortable to ask questions of a personal nature.  For this reason personality tests can be very useful.Developing understanding of personality typology, personality traits, thinking styles and learning styles theories is a very useful way to improve your knowledge of motivation and behavior of self and others, in the workplace and beyond. The more you understand about personality, the better able you are to judge what motivates people - and yourself. Some examples of easily accessible online Personality tests are:

==Motivation in Challenging Group and Team Environments==

==='''Potential causes for a poorly motivated groups and team'''=== 
:The lack of motivation or poor motivation; most often will cripple a group’s ability to succeed and or hinder its progress.  For the most part it is widely known that when a group is not motivated to perform, it will not succeed to a level of satisfaction that was previously desired.  So the question remains; why are some groups not given the motivation to succeed?  Two possible scenarios potentially explain this phenomenon: 
::1. The group leader provides the wrong type of motivation.
::2. The group is unwilling to be motivated. 
:Some type of motivation is always provided for a group to succeed.  The problem is that in several instances the methods for motivation are not correct and thus does not produce the sought after results.  The first scenario states that there are occasions when the wrong motivator is provided.  As described in the section “How to Motivate a Group;” the group leader must determine how the group needs to be motivated in order to be successful. Presuming that the group leader has successfully followed the prescribed advice and now knows what his group needs to be positively motivated; if the group fails based on motivation, what has happened?  Either the group leader disregarded his findings or he has misunderstood them.  &lt;br&gt;

:There may be situations when a group requires motivation that is unrealistic or not within the power of the group leader.  There may also be situations when a group leader is simply unwilling to motivate the group.  When he is unwilling and able; this will be a situation where the group leader may not be motivated properly and or he needs to be replaced.  On the other hand when a group requests a bonus which the leader is unable to provide; even though he is willing, this is a situation where the team may need to be dissolved or changed. &lt;br&gt;

:The second possible scenario states that the group itself is unwilling to be motivated.   Typically this will mean that either their desires are elsewhere or they no longer have faith in what they are doing.  Take the example of a business owner who earns a healthy income.  He is part of a group that provides a service at a premium.  Over time he realizes that he does not believe in the product any more.  He feels that it does not provide the value he has been promising.  As part of this team will he be effective at supporting the rest of his team members; form this point on?  The answer is it depends on what motivates him.  If he is motivated by money then, yes, he will continue to be an effective team member.  However, if he is not motivated by money than he will begin to lose interest and become very ineffective for the team.  The truth is that he may be motivated by an ethical value towards those clients he serves and therefore if the product were to change then he would be properly motivated again and would again be effective for the rest of his team.  &lt;br&gt;

:Both scenarios boil down to a leader knowing what truly motivates his group and finding a way to provide that motivation. &lt;br&gt;

=== '''Motivating a team within a negative environment'''===
:Before you are able to motivate a team who has a negative view on a project, you must first understand what caused the negative view to be held. It is best to directly talk with each team member to determine the root cause. Once it is known where the negative view comes from, actions can be taken. To begin with, the root cause should be examined.  To determine the cause, it is important to analyze the responses to questions such as:

::1. Is it an appropriate factor to have at the work environment (e.g. tight timelines)? 
::2. Is it due to a disruptive team member?
::3. Is it due to stress surrounding the project (e.g.  new procedures, difficult paperwork, etc.)? 

:Once the main factor has been examined and assessed, it is important to determine if there are additional underlying factors that can be adversely impacting team members (e.g.  no vacation in six months, new child, divorce, etc.). &lt;br&gt;


:With the main factor (and underlying factors) in hand, the negative views can be addressed head on. It is important to help shift the team’s perspective to a positive mindset. If the team is struggling against tight timelines, incentives can be put into place for when the team hits the timeline. Something as simple as a promising a launch party can successfully change the team’s dynamics. This example is a large form of recognition, but smaller forms can also be helpful in changing the team’s dynamics. &lt;br&gt;

===''' Motivating team in a Cross-Functional environment'''===
:Before learning how to motivate teams, it is best to understand what can de-motivate them. A Bnet.com&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; article provides the top ten de-motivators for team members as, “Relations with project manager, co-worker relations, remuneration, leadership, security, working conditions, the organization’s policy, team subordinate relations, personal time, title/status”. &lt;br&gt;

:Cross-functional teams can be especially difficult to motivate as each individual comes from a different group. Each group can have different goals and incentives to motivate employees. When the individuals of a cross-functional team have different goals and incentives, the results can become more individualized. In addition to different groups, cross-functional team members come from different backgrounds and ways of thinking. These differences can pull a team apart, thus de-motivating them to work together. This does not necessarily need to happen.  If differences are managed well,  they can be leveraged to make the team stronger and ultimately more motivated to perform well as a group. Furthermore, each cross-functional team will go through the four stages of a team: forming, storming, norming, and performing. It may be difficult to motivate a team during the norming and storming phases. As such, it is important to take the phase the team is at into consideration. &lt;br&gt;

:Motivating a cross-functional team, however, is possible. Rowe&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; explored the motivational issues on cross-functional teams specifically focusing on the free-rider problem. Through different experiments, Rowe found that the severity of the free-rider problem in groups was severely underestimated. So not only was there an issue within the team, but it was much larger than perceived by the team. The free-rider problem can be reduced by building trust and collectivism within the team. Rowe also found that, “when properly aligned, accounting and team structures operate interactively as a powerful group framing device that helps to resolve the free-rider problem.”  By focusing more on aligning the incentives and goals of a group, a diversified team can be motivated to perform successfully. &lt;br&gt;

:One way to align the incentives and goals within a cross-functional group is to create a project scope document. This is an exercise that not only allows the team to work together to define a project, but also gets buy-in from the team on the goals of the project. The team discusses the different aspects of the project and identifies assumptions made, items that are in/out of the scope of the project, and also identifies risks and constraints on the project. At the end of the meeting, a project scope document is formed. All team members are responsible for reviewing the document and will approve the document if everything documented fits their understanding. &lt;br&gt;

==='''Conclusion'''===
:In this book, we have discussed what motivation is as what groups can do to motivate others and some of the challenges that groups face when trying to address motivation.  Motivation can take several forms.  There are also many ways to approach motivation.  It is important to evaluate the situation that you are in and then take the approach that will motivate the group to achieve the desired outcome.  Without proper motivation, groups may not achieve their full potential or accomplish the goals that they set.    Groups must work together to set goals and work to accomplish them.  Proper motivation can ensure that groups will work together and everyone will do their part to achieve the goals of the group.  &lt;br&gt;

== Product quality (alpha = 0.92) ==
=== Description ===

Through a detailed analysis of the literature, twelve constructs of integrated quality management strategies were identified: [[Handbook of Management Scales/Top management commitment|top management commitment]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Customer focus|customer focus]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Supplier quality management|supplier quality management]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Design quality management|design quality management]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Benchmarking|benchmarking]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Statistical process control usage|SPC usage]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Internal quality information usage|internal quality information usage]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Employee empowerment|employee empowerment]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Employee involvement|employee involvement]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Employee training|employee training]], product quality, and [[Handbook of Management Scales/Supplier performance|supplier performance]]. Using a survey of 371 manufacturing firms, the constructs were then empirically tested and validated. For this purpose a confirmatory factor analysis approach was used.

=== Items ===

Answer on a scale of 1 to 7, where: 1 = worst in industry, 4 = Average, 7 = best in industry.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Overview ===

Welcome to &quot;Principles of Constructivism.&quot; This wikibook is a collaborative project and resource for  a Webster University graduate course with the same title. The course is an introduction to constructivist theories and their applications to curriculum and instruction. The course employs collaborative processes and learning community-based web technologies (i.e. Web 2.0 tools) so that students learn about constructivism by experiencing constructivist methodologies and technologies used in this course.  Participants build their knowledge and skills about constructivist theory and practice through collaborative writing and curriculum building using new interactive web technologies. 

=== Course Description ===
Students in this course explore the history, theory and educational applications of constructivism. The course employs collaborative processes and learning community-based web technologies: Participants have direct experience learning about constructivism by doing and participating in the constructivist methodologies used in this course.

=== Learning Outcomes ===
*Participants in this course will be able to:
**Demonstrate a working knowledge of the key principles of constructivism and constructivist theories 
**Author original articles that describe constructivist theories and their applications in the classroom 
**Adopt strategies to promote active student learning and questioning. 
**Design lessons that involve constructivist principles such as collaboration, student-centered learnng, authentic (real-world) problems and other creative thinking processes 
**Design pupil assessment strategies consistent with constructivist learning processes

===Innovative ===

This course is innovative in several ways: 

# The online component enables students from any geographic location to participate in the course without the need to visit a Webster University Classroom.
# The course uses constructivist and collaborative methodologies. The constructivist approach involves a philosophy of learning in which learners builds their knowledge on the basis of authentic (real-world) experiences and dialogue, debate, or collaboration with others. (Brown and King, 2000) 
# The effectiveness of the constructivist pedagogy versus objectivist pedagogies has been debated for centuries. However, current theory and research in learning indicate that all learning involves a self-constructing process. (Bransford, ''et al.'', 2000; Poole, 2000; Scardamalia and Bereiter, 1994) 
# The new Web 2.0 internet tools such as blogs, wikis and social networking now make constructivist, collaborative and authentic learning more practical, because these tools are structured and organized for open development of knowledge as well as open dialogue, debate and discussion. 
# The course is about constructivism, and has been designed to be taught using instructional techniques and technologies (such as blogs and wikis) that support the constructivist philosophy and pedagogy. 
# No textbook reading is required. Instead students in this course will collaboratively research, author and edit a textbook on &quot;Principles of Constructivism.&quot;

===Overview ===
Overview 

Constructivism proposes that by reflecting on our experiences and ideaologies, we construct our own understanding of the world we live in. It is through these channels that all generate their own cultural and moral values and beliefs.  The learner selects and processes  this information to make sense of the experiences he or she acquires.  Each person builds and constructs a framework of knowledge based on what they already know prior to anything new being useful to them. The philosophy of Constructivism purports the idea that how one thinks is more important than the accumulation and recyclying of information.

Dr. Seymour Papert is a mathematician and one of the early pioneers of Artificial Intelligence. Additionally, he is internationally recognized as the seminal thinker about ways in which  computers can change learning. Born and educated in South Africa where he participated actively in the anti-apartheid movement, Dr. Papert pursued mathematical research at Cambridge University from 1954-1958. He then worked with Jean Piaget at the University of Geneva from 1958-1963. It was this collaboration that led him to consider using mathematics in the service of understanding how children can learn and think.  Papert contended that technology should be used far more extensively in education to prey on students' inherent motivation to play (&quot;Seymour Papert&quot;, n.d.; Papert, 2005a). By adding more technology to classroom practices, Papert believed interest in science, for example, would increase substantially among learners

===Key Concepts Contributed to Constructivist Theory ===

Papert used Piaget's work in his development of the Logo programming language while at MIT. He created Logo as a tool to improve the way that children think and solve the  problems. A small robot called the &quot;Logo Turtle&quot; was developed and children used it to solve problems. A main purpose of the Logo Foundation research group is to strengthen the ability to learn knowledge. Papert insists a simple language or program that children can learn—like Logo—can also have advanced functionality for expert users.


===Evidence of Papert's Ideas in Today's Constructivist Practice ===

Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas (1980), published by Basic Books, is a book by Seymour Papert. He proposes a unique computer-based learning environment called the Microworld. His primary belief about the Microworld's design is that it compliments the natural knowledge building mechanisms of children, known as a constructivist approach to knowing and learning. His primary implication is that Microworld learning will profoundly affect the quality of knowledge gained. This work is one of the first large-scale attempts to mediate educational computer-based technology with Piagetian-based theories of learning and knowing.

The Lego Mindstorms programmable construction set system is named after the book.

===Conclusion ===

People laughed at Seymour Papert in the sixties when he talked about children using computers as instruments for learning and for enhancing creativity. The idea of an inexpensive personal computer was then science fiction. But Papert was conducting serious research in his capacity as a professor at MIT. This research led to many firsts. It was in his laboratory that children first had the chance to use the computer to write and to make graphics. The Logo programming language was created there, as were the first children's toys with built-in computation. The Logo Foundation was created to inform people about Logo and to support them in their use of Logo-based software for learning and teaching.  
Today Papert is considered the world's foremost expert on how technology can provide new ways to learn. He has carried out educational projects on every continent, some of them in remote villages in developing countries. He is a participant in developing the most influential cutting-edge opportunities for children to participate in the digital world. He serves on the advisory boards for MaMaMedia Inc. (whose founder, Idit Harel, was once a doctoral student of his at MIT) and of the LEGO Mindstorms product line (which was named after Papert's seminal book Mindstorms: Children, Computers and Powerful Ideas). 
Papert lives in Maine, where he has founded a small laboratory called the Learning Barn to develop methods of learning that are too far ahead of the times for large-scale implementation. He has been named distinguished professor by the University of Maine and is credited with inspiring the first initiative aimed at giving a personal computer to every student of a state. He spends a large part of his time working in the Maine Youth Center in Portland, the state's facility for teenagers convicted of serious offenses. 
Papert's contributions go beyond the field of education. He is a mathematician and is a cofounder with Marvin Minsky of the Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT and a founding faculty member of the MIT Media Lab, where he continues to work. Papert collaborated for many years with Jean Piaget at the University of Geneva in Switzerland. 


===Glossary ===
Construction set- a set of standardized pieces that allow for the construction of a variety of different models or buildings. The pieces avoid the lead time of manufacturing custom pieces, and of requiring special training or design time to construct complex systems. This makes them suitable for temporary structures, or for use as children's toys.

Logo -software, which is used in math programs in schools throughout the United States

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''CHAPTER 2: Major Contributors to Constructivist Theory: Jean Piaget and Lev Vygotsky'''

===Overview ===
Constructivism is a theory espousing, humans gain knowledge from their experiences, and learn in a manner influenced by these experiences. That individuals learn by their own experiences, this experiential level contributes to the subject matter to be learned. Each individual is his/her own teacher and gains more knowledge from their own life experiences. This also states an individual learns from his own set of values and mores. Constructivism is not a specific way of learning but an educational theory. Constructivism has been around as a teaching methodology for centuries. Constructivism has been popular recently through the efforts of &quot;Project Construct&quot; started in Missouri.

Jean Piaget (1896-1980) believed that children's play had an important role in constructivism and learning. His theory expounds that we learn through assimilation and accommodation. Piaget’s theory of constructivism is one of “Cognitive Constructivism”. An example was his belief that children could not reach maturation, they cannot take on certain tasks until they mature psychologically. 

Lev Vygotsky (1896 – 1934) believed that knowledge is first constructed in a social context and collaborated with other individuals or groups. This is known as “Social Constructivism”.

===Key Concepts Contributed to Constructivist Theory: Piaget ===
Piaget believed that intelligence was a single capacity that developed the same way in all individuals. Piaget also believed that at certain levels of understanding (age), that we became capable of expanding our learning by maturing and taking responsibilities due to being psychologically prepared. This occurs through the growing process by experiences. Piaget did not agree with traditional views of learning. He saw play as an important part of learning and this was from infancy to adulthood.

===Key Concepts Contributed to Constructivist Theory: Vygotsky===
The type of learning that Vygotsky viewed was one where the learners should discover their own truths about the world. He believed that instructors and learners are equally involved in the learning process. Vygotsky also believed that there is significant implications for peer collaborations. This also stressed the ideas of thought and speech being used to increase the learners ability to communicate with peers or collaborators.

===Evidence of Piaget's &amp; Vygotsky's Ideas in Today's Constructivist Practice ===
We consistently see throughout the educational arena, pieces and parts of both Piaget and Vygosky and their theories. Though many of the terminology have changed, the basic premise is still the same. We learn through our experiences. Whether in childhood as part of a continuous learning cycle from birth, or from collaborating with our peers, learning continues.

===Conclusion ===
Constructivism is a way in which we are able to learn through our own internal learning mechanism. Each person learns through his own experiences and values and all learning is based upon that schema. This is an already existing framework within the individual. What occurs is learning is based on perception and that perception is what our mind allows us to learn. Jean Piaget (1896-1980) who along with Dewey and Lev Vygotsky (1896-1934) were among the first during the early part of the 1900's to espouse constructivist learning. This was also seen as &quot;Marxist learning&quot;. Other than Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) and Giambattista Vico (1668-1744) the majority of constructivist theorists were in the early part of the 20Th Century. Here in the 21st Century the idea of Constructivist Teaching is still alive.

===Glossary ===

Cognitive Constructivism - Cognitive constructivism is based on the work of Swiss developmental psychologist Jean Piaget. Piaget's theory has two major parts: an &quot;ages and stages&quot; (http://web.psych.ualberta.ca/~mike/Pearl_Street/Dictionary/contents/P/piaget's_stages.html) component that predicts what children can and cannot understand at different ages, and a theory of development that describes how children develop cognitive abilities. It is the theory of development that will be the focus here because it is the major foundation for cognitive constructivist approaches to teaching and learning. 
Piaget's theory of cognitive development proposes that humans cannot be &quot;given&quot; information which they immediately understand and use. Instead, humans must &quot;construct&quot; their own knowledge. They build their knowledge through experience. Experiences enable them to create schemas (http://www.valdosta.peachnet.edu/~whuitt/psy702/cogsys/piaget.html) - mental models in their heads. These schemas are changed, enlarged, and made more sophisticated through two complimentary processes: assimilation and accommodation (http://web.psych.ualberta.ca/~mike/Pearl_Street/Dictionary/contents/A/adaptation.html).

Social Constructivism - 
Social constructivism is closely related to social constructionism in the sense that people are working together to construct artifacts. However, there is an important difference: social constructionism focuses on the artifacts that are created through the social interactions of a group, while social constructivism focuses on an individual's learning that takes place because of their interactions in a group.

A very simple example is an object like a cup. The object can be used for many things, but its shape does suggest some 'knowledge' about carrying liquids. A more complex example is an online course - not only do the 'shapes' of the software tools indicate certain things about the way online courses should work, but the activities and texts produced within the group as a whole will help shape how each person behaves within that group. For a philosophical account of one possible social constructionist ontology, see the 'Criticism' section of Representative realism.[1]   Wikipedia

Constructionism - Constructionist learning is inspired by the constructivist theory that individual learners construct mental models to understand the world around them. However, constructionism holds that learning can happen most effectively when people are also active in making tangible objects in the real world. In this sense, constructionism is connected with experiential learning and builds on some of the ideas of Jean Piaget. Seymour Papert defined constructionism in a proposal to the National Science Foundation entitled Constructionism: A New Opportunity for Elementary Science Education as follows: &quot;The word constructionism is a mnemonic for two aspects of the theory of science education underlying this project. From constructivist theories of psychology we take a view of learning as a reconstruction rather than as a transmission of knowledge. Then we extend the idea of manipulative materials to the idea that learning is most effective when part of an activity the learner experiences as constructing a meaningful product.&quot;  Wikipedia
Instructionism - Instructionism refers to all of the educational theories based on the idea of the teacher teaching, usually according to a predetermined schedule, rather than on students learning from their own experiences at their own pace. This includes any form of rote learning, and most forms of book learning in actual use, as well as drill and practice. 
The scientific laboratory is a place for exploration and discovery, where the principal topic of investigation is human ignorance in whatever form it currently takes, using the sharpest tools and brightest lights that human ingenuity can bring to bear. The school laboratory is almost always a place for regimented repetition of &quot;experiments&quot; whose outcome is known in advance. Similarly, a research library is a different sort of place to explore human ignorance about other kinds of questions. Here we look for interpretations of what has previously been recorded, often by comparing differing source accounts, often by finding questions that we can attempt to answer by other means. The school library is more often a place for looking up the &quot;right&quot; answer. A textbook can be an account of the frontiers of knowledge and understanding, presenting conflicting theories and attempts to find evidence to distinguish among them, or it can be a compendium of socially approved &quot;facts&quot;.

Pragmatism - is a philosophical movement that includes those who claim that an ideology or proposition is true if it works satisfactorily, that the meaning of a proposition is to be found in the practical consequences of accepting it, and that unpractical ideas are to be rejected. Pragmatism, in William James' eyes, was that the truth of an idea needed to be tested to prove its validity. Pragmatism began in the late nineteenth century with Charles Sanders Peirce and his pragmatic maxim. Through the early twentieth-century it was developed further in the works of William James, John Dewey and—in a more unorthodox manner—by George Santayana. Other important aspects of pragmatism include anti-Cartesianism, radical empiricism, instrumentalism, anti-realism, verificationism, conceptual relativity, a denial of the fact-value distinction, a high regard for science, and fallibilism. Pragmatism enjoyed renewed attention from the 1960s on when a new analytic school of philosophy (W. V. O. Quine and Wilfrid Sellars) put forth a revised pragmatism criticizing the logical positivism dominant in the United States and Britain since the 1930s. Richard Rorty further developed and widely publicized the concept of naturalized epistemology; his later work grew closer to continental philosophy and is considered relativistic by its critics. Contemporary pragmatism is divided into a strict analytic tradition, a more relativistic strand (in the wake of Rorty), and &quot;neo-classical&quot; pragmatism (such as Susan Haack) that adheres to the work of Peirce, James, and Dewey.
Essentialism - is an educational philosophy whose adherents believe that children should learn the traditional basic subjects and that these should be learned thoroughly and rigorously. An essentialist program normally teaches children progressively, from less complex skills to more complex. An Essentialist will usually teach some set subjects similar to Reading, Writing, Literature, Foreign Languages, History, Mathematics, Science, Art, and Music. The teacher's role is to instill respect for authority, perseverance, duty, consideration, and practicality. Essentialism strives to teach students the accumulated knowledge of our civilization through core courses in the traditional academic disciplines. Essentialists aim to instill students with the &quot;essentials&quot; of academic knowledge, patriotism, and character development. This traditional approach is meant to train the mind, promote reasoning, and ensure a common culture.
William Bagley (1874-1946) was an important historical Essentialist. Essentialism is related to the cultural literacy movement, which advocates the teaching of a core set of knowledge common to (and assumed to be possessed by) members of a culture or society. See also E.D. Hirsch.

Maturationism - is an early childhood educational philosophy that sees the child as a growing organism and believes that the role of education is to passively support this growth rather than actively fill the child with information. 
The idea is that genetic factors play a larger role in development than environmental ones, particularly in regard to language acquisition.

Maturationism is associated with the concept of developmental stages.

Major names in maturationism:G. E. Ames

Progressivism - Progressivists believe that individuality, progress, and change are fundamental to one's education. Believing that people learn best from what they consider most relevant to their lives, progressivists center their curricula on the needs, experiences, interests, and abilities of students. Progressivist teachers try making school interesting and useful by planning lessons that provoke curiosity. In a progressivist school, students are actively learning. The students interact with one another and develop social qualities such as cooperation and tolerance for different points of view. In addition, students solve problems in the classroom similar to those they will encounter in their everyday lives. Progressivists believe that education should be a process of ongoing growth, not just a preparation for becoming an adult. An obvious example of progressivism would be our class. We are in groups a lot and we actively learn through discussion. We talk about how what we read can be incorporated into our future teaching careers. Dr. Theodore takes into account the suggestions from the previous semester's students and modifies his class accordingly. After reading John Dewey’s book and discussing his thoughts and ideas in class, one can see John Dewey's relationship to progressivism. He wanted students to learn through action and being involved in the processes that will get to the end product. He wanted the students to work on hands-on projects so learning would take place, rather than memorization. In a regular classroom students just memorize what they need to know and it goes away after the test. In Dewey’s mind, the students would have to exercise their brain by problem solving and thinking critically, resulting in learning (even though the students may not even know it!). This allows the individual's brain to develop, so as the individual grows learning becomes easier! After attending a school Dewey would have set up, a child would be ready for the real world and a lot of the everyday setbacks that an individual would experience, such as losing a button, changing a tire, making lunch, or balancing a checkbook. School would be a lot of hands-on learning, and the progression of education would not end! Foundations of Education Web home page 
Genetic Epistemology - Epistemmology is a branch of philosophy concerned with how we know thinks.   In other words, knowing about knowing. Epistemological approaches in general - what can be known? broadly materialistic categories Nihilism (hard Scepticism) is the denial that reality can be known. Scientism asserts that 20th century scientific method is the only way to understand reality  Rationalism (including soft Scepticism) says that reason or logic, assisted by the discoveries of science, is the only way to understand reality. logical and introspective empiricism rationalism (dualistic or platonic) asserts that understanding come through pre-existing knowledge - - see also How the Rationalists Construe &quot;Clear and Distinct Ideas&quot; - by Ron Bombardi - Quite technical but probably worth the effort phenomenology reducto-ad-absurdum (as proof that Reality cannot be definied) - Shunyavada is a buddhist teaching that says that Reality cannot be known by conceptual means; it differs from Hard Scepticism is that it does assert that there is a Reality that can be attained.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Linear Cryptanalysis is using Linear mathematics (such as linear algebra) to break cryptosystems.  This approach was strong against the now-obsolute cryptosystems based on Linear Shift Registers.  Modern cryptosystems like AES and RSA use non-linear elements to prevent an attack based on linear cryptanalysis.  In AES, the S-box provides non-linearity.  In RSA, modular exponentiation provides non-linearity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Differential Cryptanalysis is decrypting a cyphertext with two different potential keys and comparing the difference.  Sometimes, this can provide insight into the nature of the cryptosystem.  Modern cryptosystems like AES are designed to prevent these kinds of attacks.

The measurements look very, very strange here.  This recipe has more butter than flour (225g butter, 180g flour) - that's plainly nonsense, all other recipes I've come across (Penguin cook book, Mrs Beeton, my mother-in-law) say weight of flour should be approx 1.5 weight of butter - this much butter to flour would be way too fatty and runny.

      <text xml:space="preserve">ElGamal is one of the simplest cryptosystems based on the discrete logarithm problem. A quick reminder of the discrete logarithm problem - given &lt;math&gt;g, h \in G&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;h = g^{x}&lt;/math&gt;, find &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. This is a hard problem when dealing with finite sets. ElGamal has a set of public parameters which can be shared by a number of users of the system. These are referred to as the domain parameters. These parameters are:
 - &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; - a large prime of around 1024 bits (currently) such that &lt;math&gt;p - 1&lt;/math&gt; is divisible by another prime &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; of around 160 bits.
 - &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; - an element of the finite field &lt;math&gt;F^{*}_{p}&lt;/math&gt; with order divisible by &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;math&gt;g^{(p - 1)/q} (mod p) \ne 1&lt;/math&gt;.

The domain parameters create a public group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with a prime order &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; and a generator &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, we create a large but finite group, and a method of ordering that group (the generator), and we know that it will contain a prime number of elements. These are the properties we are after. These parameters are public, and the security of the system depends on the public and private key pair, which we shall generate next.

The private key &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a randomly-chosen integer. The public key is &lt;math&gt;h = g^{x} (mod p)&lt;/math&gt;.

In order to encrypt a message &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; we generate a random ephemeral key &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, and calculate:
&lt;math&gt;c_{1} = g^{k}
c_{2} = m * h^{k}&lt;/math&gt;

This gives us the ciphertext &lt;math&gt;c = (c_{1}, c_{2})&lt;/math&gt;.

In order to decrypt a ciphertext we compute:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{c_{2}}{c_{1}^{x}} = \frac{m * h^{k}}{g^{x * k}} = \frac{m * g^{x * k}}{g^{x * k}} = m&lt;/math&gt;

As you can see from the decryption method, the message 0 will encrypt to itself, so not a good choice of message. In addition to this, as a result of using the ephemeral key &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, which will change every time you can see that the same message &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; will encrypt to many different ciphertexts.

Since the ciphertext is expressed as 2 integers of the same length as the message, we end up with ciphertexts being twice as large as the message they're encrypting.

|name=Gooseberry
|image=Stachelbeeren.jpg
|description=
The gooseberry is a straggling bush growing to 1-3 meters (3-10 feet) tall, the branches being thickly set with sharp spines, standing out singly or in diverging tufts of two or three from the bases of the short spurs or lateral leaf shoots. The bell-shaped flowers are produced, singly or in pairs, from the groups of rounded, deeply-crenated 3 or 5 lobed leaves. The fruit of wild gooseberries is smaller than in the cultivated varieties, but is often of good flavour; it is generally hairy, but in one variety smooth, constituting the R. uva-crispa of writers; berries' colour is usually green, but there are red variants and occasionally deep purple berries occur.
|range=The gooseberry is indigenous in Europe and western Asia, growing naturally in alpine thickets and rocky woods in the lower country, from France eastward, well into the Himalayas and peninsular India.  It is a non-native species occurring throughout most of North America.
|season=June to September
|use=Gooseberries are best known for their use in desserts such as Gooseberry Fool and Gooseberry Crumble. In some countries, like Portugal, gooseberries are very appreciated as a beverage, being mostly used mixed with soda, water or even milk.  They can be eaten raw, though many species should be cooked down to soften the spines.  They are also commonly used in making jelly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Key length is directly proportional to security.&quot;

This seems misleading to me.

First, it falls into the trap that many snake-oil companies use: download our new amazing cryptosystem, that uses 9000-bit keys!!!!

Second, it misses the fact that different types of crypto need different length keys to achieve the same level of security.  A public-key system using a 4096-bit key is not 32 times more secure than AES with a 128 bit key.

Most generally, it's taking a point about the mathematics of a brute-force search and claiming, incorrectly, that brute-force resistance is equivalent to security.  Since every system in use today uses keys large enough to make brute-force impossible, this is especially untrue.

-----------  Did you read the second and third paragraphs?  This is all covered extensively there.

The second paragraph does a good job of clarifying.  The 3rd paragraph, I don't understand what it's trying to say.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=AHI - Audio Hardware Independent=

The preferred audio application interface on AROS is AHI. Most (and hopefully all future) applications use AHI for audio playback and capturing. AHI's settings can be accessed at SYS:Prefs/AHI.

AHI provides a set of &quot;Units&quot; for applications to use for sound play back or capturing. 

After booting AROS for the first time, you have to set audio modes for AHI's Units, see next paragraph.


==AHI Units and audio modes==

After setting or changing a Unit's audio mode, hit &quot;Use&quot; to use the mode for this session, or &quot;Save&quot; to keep it permanently.


==AHI supported devices==

[table: device / playback / capture / duplex]

Applications using direct AmigaOS style device access are not affected by AHI settings. Playback volume, rate, etc. will depend on the application's settings, and may interfere with applications using AHI.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Is the illustration of the volume rendering technique correct?

Since the formula is recursive, and the earlier pixels are already accounted for in the B row, we shouldn't have to sum the C row, right? After all, each B already contains the blended contributions of the column before it. So the final pixel is just (Voxel value * Opacity) + (B * [1-Opacity]) = 191.4, using only values from the final column.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Much has been written about the most effective ways to form team cohesion.  The purpose of this chapter is to offer concrete ideas for team leaders on how they can develop team cohesion amongst group member in an organizational setting.  

Some of the ideas are inspired by researchers such as Patrick Lencioni, however, many of the ideas within this chapter have been compiled from the collective experiences of its authors and other research.  

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;[[Image:Team_Cohesion_Star.jpg]]&lt;/div&gt;

Five concrete ideas for building team cohesion will be presented including:  Appreciation, Incentive, Relevance, Performance Measurement and Interpersonal Relationships.   

A model has been created to help the reader recall these points.  The model is presented as a star with each point representing one of the five attributes fundamental to building team cohesion.  



== Appreciation ==

It has been said that there are only two types of people in the world who benefit from gratitude and sincere appreciation – men and women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Matyjevich, Wendy | title= Praise and Recognition: Positively Good for Business | url= http://www.csemag.com/article/177469-Praise_and_Recognition_Positively_Good_for_Business.php | accessdate= March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, all humans have a basic need to feel appreciated, respected and valued.  In Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, esteem is recognized as a fundamental human desire which must be fulfilled in order to achieve self-actualization (Maslow’s hierarchy of needs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Maslow’s hierarchy of needs | work= Wikipedia | url= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs#Esteem | accessdate= March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effective team leader can utilize appreciation as an important tool to fill this esteem need for individual team members and work to create and maintain a culture of appreciation within the team to insure that a team is cohesive.

In a 2003 study by the US Department of Labor on employment, the number one reason given for why people decided to leave their jobs was a lack of appreciation.  Just as an underappreciated employee is more likely to leave a job, an underappreciated team member is more likely to leave a team.  Without feeling valued as contributors within the context of the team and its objectives, individual team members are much more apt to feel disconnected and isolated from the team.  To maintain a cohesive team, all members need to feel some degree of appreciation for their efforts.  On a group level, a team which is not esteemed and recognized for their contributions has little chance of remaining cohesive, functional and successful.

To view it in a more positive way, a team is much more likely to be unified, collaborative and ultimately successful in a culture that is built on appreciation and recognition of the contributions of each individual, as well as the unique contributions of the team.  Demonstrations of gratitude, acknowledgements of effort, words of congratulations and other actions of appreciation function as the glue which binds a successful and cohesive team together.  As the French philosopher Voltaire put it, “Appreciation is a wonderful thing: It makes what is excellent in others belong to us as well.” For a team leader to succeed, he must take the unique contributions of each team member and forge them into a combined team identity, and appreciation is fundamental to this endeavor. 

===Creating a Culture of Appreciation===

Creating and maintaining a culture of appreciation within a team requires a concerted focus by the team leader (and team members) on certain behaviors and characteristics.  Below we have identified 6 guidelines related to the principle of appreciation which team leaders can use as they work on building a strong and cohesive team.  Of course this is not an exhaustive list, but it provides a strong foundation on which a culture of appreciation can be built.

====1. Praise Individuals and Teams====

:Appreciation is a principle which applies to individuals within a team and to the team itself.  For a team to be cohesive, the leader must concentrate on both areas.  Without individual recognition, a team member may feel his/her individual contributions are irrelevant, unimportant and invisible.  Without team recognition, cohesion is much more difficult to maintain, as the focus is directed away from the team’s accomplishments.  Finding a balance between team and individual appreciation is not an exact science, and may vary with the unique dynamics of a particular team.  However, both individual and team praise must be present to maximize the potential for team cohesion.

====2. Praise in Private and in Public====

:Acknowledging and recognizing accomplishments should be done both in the private and the public spheres.  Expressions of appreciation are reinforced when shown in multiple venues.  A team’s willingness to put in significant extra time to complete a project by the deadline could warrant a personal thank you to each team member by the team leader, as well as a team celebration lunch.  Going one step further, the team leader could send an e-mail to select upper management detailing the extra effort put in by the team (make sure to Cc the team members).  Of course the specific actions are limitless.  The point here is to reinforce the appreciation message and, through public and private usage, cause it to permeate throughout the different strata of the individual, team and organizational culture.

====3. Be Specific====

:Make sure you really get to know each team member so that you can tailor your appreciation message to each individual as needed.  Take time to learn about a team member’s family, hobbies and interests, preferences, and values.  This will allow you to give praise, recognition and appreciation that will be personally valuable to each team members.  In recognizing or praising a team member, do not speak in generalities.  Instead of, “great job, Amir,” the team leader could say, “Amir, your contribution to the finance meeting this morning was excellent.  I was particularly impressed with your grasp of the division’s key drivers.”  The latter statement acknowledges specific attributes and provides Amir with specific feedback on what his unique contribution was.  Similarly, appreciation at the Team level should be specific and should demonstrate the team leader’s interest in and knowledge of the team’s purpose and accomplishments.

====4. Be Sincere====

:As the cliché goes, flattery will get you nowhere.  When people get the sense that words of praise or acts of acknowledgement are not coming from the heart, trust is quickly eroded.  A team leader should never follow up a complement with a “but” or bring up a mistake that was made by the team or team member.  There is a time and place for that, and it is not during an expression of appreciation.   

====5. Frequency====

:When it comes to appreciation, more is more.  As long as the appreciation is sincere and specific, it is nearly impossible to show appreciation too much.  Whether it is a personal thank you note, a short recognition speech in front of the team or an e-mail to top management on a team’s accomplishment, appreciation must become a cultural norm.  Consistency is the key.  Just one of many ways in which a team leader can think about frequency is to create three divisions: day-to-day, informal and formal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Baudville Inc, Day-to-day Recognition White Paper | url= http://www.baudville.com/D2D_White_Paper/pdfs  | accessdate= March 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Appreciation must be demonstrated often for it to become a part of a team’s psyche.

====6. Develop an Appreciation Plan====

:With the tools above, a team leader should put pen to paper, so to speak, and develop a written appreciation plan.  This will function as a blueprint to creating and maintaining a culture of appreciation.  Ideas for the structure of this plan are many and varied.  A few examples of appreciation/recognition plans from the corporate world can be found in “Rewarding Teams: Lessons from the Trenches” by Glenn Parker, Jerry McAdams and David Zielinski.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Parker |first= Glen |coauthors= Jerry McAdams, D. Zielinski |title= [[Rewarding Teams: Lessons from the Trenches]] |publisher= [[Jossey-Bass]] |year= 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  “The Carrot Principle”, by Chester Elton and Adrian Gostick also provides insights into creating a detailed recognition plan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Elton |first= Chester |coauthors= Adrian Gostick |title= [[The Carrot Principle]] |publisher= [[Free Press]] |year= 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Whether your plan includes weekly awards, team highlights in the company newsletter, taking a team member out to lunch, all or none of the above, the plan should integrate the principles previously described: namely individual and team praise, private and public praise, being specific, being sincere and a high degree of frequency.  A written appreciation plan will provide the impetus to take the above concepts and make them a reality.

===Remarkable Results===

In a scene from the movie Remember the Titans, based on the true story of a high school football team which overcame many potentially divisive challenges and obstacles to come together and win the 1971 Virginia State Football Championship, Coach Herman Boone takes his team to the site of the United States Civil War battle of Gettysburg.  There, with a morning mist hanging over the once bloody battlefield, he delivers an impassioned plea for team unity and cohesion.  

“You listen…take a lesson from the dead,” directed Coach Boone.  “If we don’t come together, right now on this hallowed ground, we too will be destroyed…just like they were.”  

“And I don’t care if you like each other or not.  But you will respect each other.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= [[Remember the Titans]] |publisher= [[Walt Disney Pictures]] |year= 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coach Boone then went about creating a culture of appreciation, by demanding it from his staff and his team, and living it himself.  The results were remarkable.

Each team leader faces unique challenges and obstacles to in maintaining a cohesive team. Among these challenges is creating a culture where the basic human need of appreciation is met for each team member and the team as a whole.  When a team feels appreciated and recognized, and each individual within that team feels likewise, the team is free to come together as a cohesive unit and to create, collaborate and succeed.


== Incentive ==

As we continue to explore the contributing factors to team cohesion, recognizing the importance of incentives is fundamental to team success.  While developing organizational success through incentives is a topic of much attention and misunderstanding amongst business leaders, interpreting the various factors that encourage people to perform at high levels of personal success leads to insights of how they might perform in a team setting.  As good leaders are in constant pursuit to improve the processes and successes of their projects through the use of teams, proper implementation of incentives and rewards should be emphasized and understood.

“In economics and sociology, an incentive is any factor (financial or non-financial) that enables or motivates a particular course of action.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Henneman, Robert | title= Implementing Total Reward Strategies | work= SHRM Foundation Products | url=www.shrm.org/foundations| accessdate=2010-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Types of incentives include cash bonuses, merit increases, promotion, leadership opportunities, as well as recognition.  As it should be safe to say that everyone likes to be rewarded for their efforts or actions, Frank LaFasto states “good effort needs to be recognized.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= LaFasto |first= Frank |coauthors= Carl Larson |title= [[When Teams Work Best]] |publisher= Sage Publications, Inc |year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether individuals recognize them as incentives or rewards, funneling these driving factors in a manner that increases productivity and success can be very beneficial to the team environment.  Robert Henneman notes the importance of group recognition by stating “group incentives have a stronger influence on productivity that individual incentives yielding increases of 13%, but more importantly they reinforce the concept of teamwork.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Henneman, Robert | title= Implementing Total Reward Strategies | work= SHRM Foundation Products | url=www.shrm.org/foundations| accessdate=2010-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to ensure that incentive tools are used in the most beneficial and influential manner for the team as a whole, the team leader needs to properly identify and integrate the teams objective.  As the team leader “ensures that rewards and incentives are aligned with achieving the team’s goals”, team members feel a sense of accomplishment through an association to the group process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= LaFasto |first= Frank |coauthors= Carl Larson |title= [[When Teams Work Best]] |publisher= Sage Publications, Inc |year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By doing so, individual team members will achieve a higher sense of team worth through their collaboration and contribution.  By keeping rewards “fair”, LaFasto states that individual members of a team will internally channel the feelings of a reward as if it is a “burden of proof.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= LaFasto |first= Frank |coauthors= Carl Larson |title= [[When Teams Work Best]] |publisher= Sage Publications, Inc |year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; A method of reward permits individual members to identify with the teams objective and feel a sense of camaraderie through such achievement.  This in turn has an incredible sense of value that can create strong bonds of trust and commitment to team establishment.

As managers devise methods of assuring proper channels of recognition and incentive, it is important to note that financial and non-financial methods can both be equally impactful.  As Robert Henneman explains “Recognition can exert a powerful impact on an employee’s performance and may influence organizations effectiveness as much as financial incentives do.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Henneman, Robert | title= Implementing Total Reward Strategies | work= SHRM Foundation Products | url=www.shrm.org/foundations| accessdate=2010-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a strong point for managers to remember as they strive to build their team members moral on an individual basis as well as on the team level.  Even though incentive and reward have a financial connotation, it is important to note the impact that simple recognition can have on a team.

One of the driving factors that contribute to the success of incentives and rewards toward developing team cohesion is the continual impact this has on the individual.  For example, if a team is given the opportunity to choose future projects and make certain decisions based on their ability to achieve success and elevated results as a team, more emphasis and importance on team interaction will be seen.  Team members that are task oriented react very responsively to opportunities or incentives that will give them more initiative or influence on future decisions.

Because of the tremendous impact that meaningful incentives have on team projects and goals, long-term behaviors begin to form with the team.  Eventually, teams are able to collaborate their individual “personal, financial, and psychological rewards to their group goals.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= LaFasto |first= Frank |coauthors= Carl Larson |title= [[When Teams Work Best]] |publisher= Sage Publications, Inc |year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simple incentive programs that are relevant to the overall teams goals and objectives create a more focused approach to how the team members interact and respect each of their individual duties.  Whether or not each of the team members have an equitable position in the physical process at hand, each member feels a sense of placement and share of the team when recognition is given to the team as a whole.

One of the greatest effects of team incentives that provide evidence of the formation of long term team cohesion is the development of organization standards.  As more and more incentives are implemented that are in line with the individual teams objectives, there is an increase of reward and visibility within the organization as a whole.  This creates an atmosphere of creativity and success which over time develops into what is understood as organizational or team standards.  As LaFasto states “a reward should be a celebration of standards.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= LaFasto |first= Frank |coauthors= Carl Larson |title= [[When Teams Work Best]] |publisher= Sage Publications, Inc |year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over long periods of time, these recognized successes which have become standards are what ultimately shape an organization’s or team’s culture.  For example, if a team is highly motivated to be the industry’s leading organization for a certain product and achieves that result and is ultimately recognized for that, a lasting expectation of highly notable success is eventually adopted.  This is one of the very reasons why incentives are very effective for not only short term projects but also for the long-term well being of the organization or team.

Through proper alignment of team objectives and motivations, team leaders have a tremendous opportunity to build team cohesion through the proper and strategic use of incentives.  Individual team members as well as the team as a whole require the recognition and reward that should be demonstrated when high levels of success are achieved and lasting standards are devised.  Whether it is a team bonus for devising a merger deal or a trophy that is presented in front of the entire organization to each of the winning team members, “excellent results must be recognized” and are developed by strategically aligned incentives that drive upward success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= LaFasto |first= Frank |coauthors= Carl Larson |title= [[When Teams Work Best]] |publisher= Sage Publications, Inc |year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relevance ==

Perhaps one of the most challenging aspects of leading a team of individuals is making each member of the team feel relevant.  What does this exactly mean?  Consider the following excerpt from the 1949 World War II movie 12 O’ClockHigh. The script picks up after General Savage asks Lt. Jesse Bishop how he feels about the bombing run the team had just accomplished.

:'''Lt. Bishop''':  Well sir, that's hard. I don't know how I feel. That's kind of the trouble.

:'''General Savage''':  What is?

:'''Lt. Bishop''': The whole thing sir, everything. I can't see what good we're doing with our bombing.  All the boys getting killed.  Just a handful of us, it's like we're some kind of guinea pigs, only we're not proving anything.  You've got to have confidence in something, then when you find something you've got confidence in, then everything changes.  It just doesn't make any sense. I just want out.

:'''General Savage''':  Do you think it will be any better in another group?

:'''Lt. Bishop''':  It isn't a question of that sir; I don't want to fly anymore. I want to transfer to another branch.

:'''General Savage''':  Doesn't it mean anything to you that we hit the target today with no losses?  

:'''Lt. Bishop''': Yes sir....I suppose so...in a way, but I just want out. 

:'''General Savage''':  well, that's a pretty tough request from a medal of honor man.  Sure we're guinea pigs Jesse, but there's a reason.  If we can hang on here now, one day soon somebody's gonna look up and see a solid overcast of American bombers on their way to Germany to hit the Third Reich where it lives. Maybe we won't be the ones to see it, I can't promise you that, but I can promise you that they'll be there if only we can manage to make the grade now.

:'''Lt. Bishop''':  I'd like to believe you sir. I just don't have confidence in anything anymore.&lt;ref&gt;12’O Clock High. 1949. Twentieth Century- Fox Film Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;

This exchange between General Savage and Lt. Bishop illustrates what happens with many members of group or teams.  Often, members of the team feel much like Lt. Bishop when, even after achieving the desired result, can’t see what good they are doing.  In other words, they feel that the work they are doing is irrelevant to the overall goal and objective of the team or organization.  

In his book Three Signs of a Miserable Job, Patrick Lencioni cites this idea of irrelevance as being one of the main signs of a miserable job.  For our purposes, we can also say that irrelevance is a main sign of a team member feeling miserable within the group.  Lencioni states that, “everyone needs to know that their job matters, to someone. Anyone. Without seeing a connection between the work and the satisfaction of another person or group of people, an employee simply will not find lasting fulfillment. Even the most cynical employees need to know that their work matters to someone, even if it’s just the boss.”  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Lencioni |first= Patrick |title= Three Signs of a Miserable Job |publisher= Jossey-Bass |year= 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now that we’ve flushed out this idea of irrelevance, how do team leaders ensure that each one of the team members feels fulfillment in the role that they are playing within the group?  This chapter has cited other topics that lend to helping a team member feel relevant.  Ideas such as incentives and measurement can all assist in making group members feel fulfilled, however there are a few important points that team leaders must touch on to avoid feelings of irrelevance amongst team members.  

===Focus on the Goal===
Kevin Eikenberry, Chief Potential Officer of Kevin Eikenberry Group explains, “Teams don't have to be aligned with the goals of the organization. Teams can work on what they believe to be the right things. They can work diligently on creating the results they think matter. They can be completely committed to success from their perspective.”  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Eikenberry, Kevin |title=  Aligning Your Office Team with Organizational Goals |work= The Sideroad |url=  http://www.sideroad.com/Team_Building/office-team.html |accessdate= March 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, teams operate in this manner to the extent that although the team is working towards goals they believe are important to the team, those goals may be totally opposite of the strategic goals of the company.  In the end, although the team may have accomplished much, team members fail to see how their work mattered in the grand scheme of the organization’s goals.  

The result of the team not aligning its goals with what the organization needs results in the team operating in a vacuum.  Eikenberry goes on to say, “sometimes the vacuum is caused by a far more pervasive problem - no clear organizational goals, objectives or strategies exist to align to. Leaders must create clear strategies and they must create a clear line of sight throughout the organization, so people and teams can connect their work to the important strategies of the organization.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Eikenberry, Kevin |title=  Aligning Your Office Team with Organizational Goals |work= The Sideroad |url=  http://www.sideroad.com/Team_Building/office-team.html |accessdate= March 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One would think that business leaders might have an easy time in assisting teams to align its goals with the overall goals of the organization, however, many times business leaders may neglect to clarify goals to the team or simply forget to share the goals with them.  In the end, it is the responsibility of the business leaders to align the team’s goals.   The question becomes, how do leaders accomplish this task?  The following illustrates some steps that Eikenberry gives as ways to connect the team’s work to organizational goals:  

'''Start At The Beginning:''' Do not communicate the goals of the organization until those goals are set.  Changing the goal midway through the group’s work may derail the team.  Once the goals are set, communicate these goals clearly in the early stages of the team’s development.  Lastly, make sure that you clearly connect the work the team is doing to the organization goal(s).  

'''Generate Conversation:'''  The delivery method of the goal to the team is extremely important.  Do not deliver the organization’s goals in an email or a packet, but rather present the goal verbally to the team and ask for feedback from the team and how their work will fit into these goals.  

'''Get The Team’s Help:'''  Get the team’s input and give them a chance to come up with team goals and objectives that align with the organizational goals.  This will create ownership and allow for a higher level of agreement between team members. 

'''Provide a Connection:'''  Teams need someone from outside the team to act as a liaison between the team and organization.  This usually comes in the way of a team sponsor who doesn’t necessarily sit on the team but provides support and keeps the team from feeling alone. 

'''Make Them Accountable:'''  Once team goals properly align with organization goals, then it is easier to have accountability within the team.  Not only does this improve the team’s results, but can also improve overall team dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Eikenberry, Kevin |title=  Aligning Your Office Team with Organizational Goals |work= The Sideroad |url=  http://www.sideroad.com/Team_Building/office-team.html |accessdate= March 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ensuring that the team’s goals align with organizational goals allows for team members to easily connect their work back to a larger objective.  By clearly providing this connection, team member will feel that the work that they do both as a team and as individuals make a difference far beyond just the immediate members of the team. 

===Focus on Personalities:=== 
There really isn’t just one way to resolve the issue of team member’s feelings of irrelevance or the feeling that the work they do goes unnoticed.  Perhaps, one way to solve this problem is to properly understand the many personalities that comprise the team.  There are about a million different personality tests on the internet that can be taken, of which the most popular is Myers-Briggs.  

How does understanding the personalities of team members assist team leaders in making members of the team feel relevant?  Many of us easily see personality traits in one another.  It is fairly easy for us talk about certain personality traits.  We may hear other people tell us that we are energetic or that we are sensitive, however, what do these types of personality traits mean within the context of the team?  More importantly, by completely understanding team member’s personalities, team leaders can use techniques to assist them in making the team member’s work feel relevant and valued. 

As mentioned, Myers-Briggs personality test is the most popular personality test, however, one personality profile that is useful in our context is called the SELF Quiz and can be found at http://www.nationalseminarstraining.com/selfquiz/indexHP.cfm.  By answering and scoring a series of questions, team members can find out which of the four interaction styles their personality mirrors.  The test reveals whether you are a Social, an Efficient, a Loyal, or a Factual.  A complete analysis of what each style means is provided.  The test is free and takes only minutes to complete.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= National Seminars Training: Quiz  |url= from http://www.nationalseminarstraining.com/selfquiz/indexHP.cfm |accessdate= March 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most interesting information we can pull out of this is the style definition for each of the four categories.   For example, someone who falls into the Social category, according to the style definition, is motivated by opportunities and friendship.  People who fall into the Efficient category are motivated by success, control and recognition.  

These kinds of insights are important for team leaders and can assist in helping make each team member feel that their work is important and relevant to the team and the organization.  A team leader dealing with someone belonging to the Efficient category may find that giving that person control over certain aspects of the work may make that team member feel all the more relevant.  Likewise, the team leader may try to ensure that someone belonging to the Social category has enough opportunity to connect with people on the team and in the organization in order to go beyond professional relationships and form friendly relationships as well.  

The idea of analyzing team members’ personalities may be somewhat of an unconventional method of making members feel relevant within the team.  However, understanding personalities goes far beyond just understanding how individual personalities may affect team dynamics.  Personalities should be leveraged appropriately to ensure that the needs of each member are met to the best of the team leader’s capabilities.  

===Focus on individual responsibilities:===
Many times team leaders don’t have the option of choosing which members will make up the team.  Regardless, each member will have individual responsibilities within the team.  Often, team leaders may give certain responsibilities to team members according to their expertise or strengths in particular areas.  Other times, the team leader may ask a team member to be responsible for something outside of that person’s expertise in order to gain new perspectives, ideas, or insights.  

At any rate, it is important that the responsibilities given to team members allow them to feel fulfilled.  For example, a team member may not feel comfortable performing high level quantitative analysis but will still accept the responsibility.  Days later that team member may begin to feel frustrated and may feel that the work he/she is doing is subpar and therefore somewhat worthless to the team.    

The point here is that no team dynamic is the same.  Team leaders have the responsibility to ensure that individual responsibilities assigned to team members allow the individual to have the success needed in order to avoid feelings of irrelevance within the team.  

Finally, there are many ways to ensure that team members feel relevant within the team.  Aligning team members’ work to organization goals, understanding how personalities play a role, and ensuring that individual responsibilities allow for team members to feel fulfilled are just three ways that will help team leaders create feelings of relevance among team members.



== Performance Measurement ==

One element key to maintaining morale within a group is the measurement of performance.  It is not sufficient to simply measure whether or not the main task was accomplished.  There will be times that in spite of superior effort by the group and the individuals within it, they may not achieve their goal.  If a group is marked as a failure in these cases, team members are demoralized and are not inspired to participate in the future.  In addition, it is important to measure the performance of individuals within the group to motivate each group member to put forth their best effort.  Individual performance measurement will also benefit the organization as a whole in that new strengths (and weaknesses) may be discovered as the group works together.

===Determining what to measure===
To maintain morale, the factors being measured must have relevancy not only to the individuals within the group, but also to the organization to which the group belongs.  These factors will vary from group to group and from organization to organization.  The factors may be specific to the task at hand, e.g. an engineering group may be assigned to design a child safety seat which meets or exceeds government standards.  In some cases the organization may also have larger goals in mind, e.g. individuals from engineering and marketing may be assigned to accomplish a task and one of the goals the organization has, in addition to designing a safety seat, is also to  improve communication and cooperation between the departments within the organization.

In The Journal for Quality and Participation, Jack Zigon notes, “It is not always obvious what results should be measured. Most teams will use the obvious measures without asking what results they should be producing and how they will know they've done a good job. Even if you know what to measure, it is often not clear how the measurement should be done. Not everything can be easily measured with numbers, thus teams give up when faced with measuring something like &quot;creativity&quot; or &quot;user-friendliness.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Zigon, Jack |title= Team Performance Measurement |work= The Journal for Quality and Participation |url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3616/is_199805/ai_n8796212/?tag=content;col1 |accessdate= 2010-2-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performances that can be measured:===
*Achievement of objective – While this is obviously important and still needs to be measured, unfortunately in many cases it is the only element measured.
*Achievement of milestones – Since many projects are complex and may take years to complete, measuring milestones not only provides occasional motivation for members of a group but also helps track the group’s progress.
*Effort of the group as a whole – Inevitably there will be some tasks assigned to groups which are not completed, such as finding a cure for a particular disease.  To encourage future participation in other efforts or even in the same effort, management needs to, when appropriate, reward the efforts of a group.  In addition, monitoring and measuring the groups’ effort will help determine the wisdom of utilizing certain individuals or the group as a whole for future projects.
*Individual’s team contribution – Participation in team meetings, volunteering for projects, the number of ideas contributed and whether other team members believe them to a valuable part of the team are all areas that can be measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Team Performance Model |work= FAA Human Factors |url= http://www.hf.faa.gov/webtraining/TeamPerform/Team028.htm |accessdate= 2010-2-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Individual behavior - How well the individual works with other team members,  communicates in a constructive way, cooperates with other team members and participates in group discussions and decision making are important behaviors to measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Team Performance Model |work= FAA Human Factors |url= http://www.hf.faa.gov/webtraining/TeamPerform/Team028.htm |accessdate= 2010-2-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Group behavior – This includes running effective meetings, communicating well with each other, allowing opinions to be shared and coming to a consensus on decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Team Performance Model |work= FAA Human Factors |url= http://www.hf.faa.gov/webtraining/TeamPerform/Team028.htm |accessdate= 2010-2-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Understanding from the beginning===
It is important that from the beginning the team members understand the following:
#Their performance will be measured
#Why the measurements are important 
#Who will be measuring their performance
#How the measurements will be measured
#Which performances will be measured
#The potential rewards or consequences of the measurements, if any
#Whether any of the performances have priority over others
Having this understanding from the beginning will allow team members to recognize what, besides accomplishing the task, is important to the organization; in addition these measurements can help guide the team as they work on the task.

===Periodic check-ups===
If the task is going to take a considerable amount of time to accomplish, periodic measurements should be taken and feedback shared so that the team can have a clear understanding of their performance along the way and can make adjustments as necessary.  It will also give team members a formal method to bring up concerns.  An additional benefit is that team members can be encouraged throughout the process and will be reminded that how they are performing their task is a matter of on-going interest to the organization.  

===Feedback system===
Jack Zigon also emphasized the importance of creating a feedback system.  The system consists of the documents and procedures used to collect and summarize the data.  He suggests the following steps to design the feedback system:
#Decide what data to collect for each performance standard. The data should be relevant to the standard and specific enough to allow the team to know what was right and wrong compared with the standard. 
#Decide which source the feedback should come from. Possibilities include the job itself, a team member, the team leader, or other people who receive the team's work.
#Decide whether all data or just a sample should be collected. Collect all the data if the measure is very critical and needs to be tracked each time it occurs, or if the accomplishment is performed infrequently. Sample the performance if the accomplishment is performed so frequently that it is not practical to collect all data. 
#Determine when to collect the data. When possible, collect it immediately after completing the work. 
#Determine who should collect the data. When possible the team should collect the data unless gathering the data disrupts the work flow and takes too much time or the completed work is seen only by another person. 
#Determine who, other than the team, needs to receive the data. 
#Review existing reports for possible use as feedback reports. They can be used if the information is relevant to the standard, is specific enough, is frequent enough to be of value, and is not cluttered with useless information. 
#If possible, modify existing reports to meet the criteria. 
#Create your own feedback tables or graphs where necessary. 
#Decide whether it would be of value to summarize the data. If the data covers a short period of time daily, for example-summarizing is probably appropriate. 
#Create the forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Zigon, Jack |title= Team Performance Measurement |work= The Journal for Quality and Participation |url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3616/is_199805/ai_n8796212/?tag=content;col1 |accessdate= 2010-2-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When group members have a clear vision of not only what they are to accomplish but also the importance of their individual contribution and how that will be measured, it will help unify and motivate them throughout the experience.  It also helps management recognize the importance of the individual within the organization.  A common understanding among team members and by management of what is expected helps facilitate the fulfillment of those expectations and aids in the accomplishment of their goals.



== Interpersonal Relationships ==

Groups can be a very effective tool in solving problems and accomplishing tasks. The combined intellects, efforts and creativeness of a group of individuals provides a better outcome than could come from one individual or even from the same individuals working solo on the same tasks. The combination leads to more satisfying outcomes and efficient work.

However groups and teams have their drawbacks. Effectively aligning the differing views of the members of the group can lead to disagreements and has the potential for conflict. It is therefore important to encourage the positive aspects while eliminating the negative aspects of a team in the workplace environment. This section looks at how to increase the positive while mitigating the negative aspects of the interpersonal relationships.

===What are Interpersonal Relationships?===
A team, in the business context, is a group of people that have been placed together to complete a task or solve a problem. They share a common purpose and are interdependent on the other members of the team. The interdependence of the members of the team creates interpersonal relationships. An interpersonal relationship is an association between two or more people.

===How are Interpersonal Relationships Beneficial?===
One of the greatest assets that a group or team can have is good interpersonal relationships with each other.  A team that feels comfortable working together can have an energy that creates a positive environment and work ethic that can lift a team, making it more effective. This positive environment can make team members work harder, more efficiently and more productively.
Teams that work well together have been shown to be more effective. In fact, how well teams achieve goals is directly related to how effective the team is at working together. “Healthy team relationships are characteristic of unusually successful teams.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= LaFasto |first= Frank |coauthors= Carl Larson |title= [[When Teams Work Best]] |publisher= Sage Publications, Inc |year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, interpersonal conflict is the most destructive force to a team’s success. A team that cannot work effectively together will not work effectively at all. 

There have been arguments that a team does not have to have a good interpersonal relationship in order to be effective. But consider the fact that a team in which the members rely on and trust each other is not putting forth additional effort to manage conflict, hurt, and bias or trying to guess what the “opposition” is doing. They are able to focus their efforts more effectively. Time and energy are directed at the common goal and not at resolving conflicts within the group dynamic. They are all able to put forth 100% of their efforts to the project at hand, confident in the fact that each member is doing the same, not worrying about what the other participants may be thinking or doing. 

Just imagine two different working scenarios. In the first one, those involved in their particular project are energized and excited about coming in to work.  They enjoy the association and sense of accomplishment from working within their group. The other group members despise getting up in the morning knowing they have to come in to work.  They hate what they do and those that they work with.

It’s pretty obvious which group is going to be more effective at completing their project.

===Interpersonal Conflict===
Whenever you put a group of individuals together there is the potential for conflict. These interpersonal conflicts tend to arise due to personal differences between individuals. This conflict is damaging to the team and their environment. It degrades the effectiveness of achieving the highest outcomes. A team is made up of individuals. Each individual has their own thoughts, ideas, and personality. Consequently, these don’t always align, nor should they. A team made up of clones, would destroy the whole purpose of putting a group of individuals together in the first place. A team is not formed for the sole purpose that “many hands make light work,” but because they each have skills and talents specific to the individual. Therefore, each member adds to the group in a different way.

As organizations change their structures to be flatter, the team has become the predominant entity within the company. Teams are used to complete projects, solve problems and many other functions within the organization. However the team structure creates an environment in which managers rely on peer relationships to accomplish tasks. In groups where team members have a similar objective and where there is a friendly atmosphere, especially if they have been working in conjunction for a while, the team will work well together and there will be fewer conflicts. “Inevitably, though, no matter how harmonious the group or how structured the organization, conflicts are bound to occur. Some conflicts may feel unproductive, even destructive.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Cartwright |first= Talula |title= [[Managing Conflict with Peers]] |publisher= [[Center for Creative Leadership]] |year= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

You can take a group of skilled, intelligent and competent individuals and put them together and their success in a group will come down to whether or not they can work together. The amount of brain power, skill and potential to solve problems will matter little if they cannot work in harmony. If contention, feelings of spite, betrayal, or disloyalty arise than it will undermine the work of each individual to the point that nothing can be accomplished. For this very reason one of the most important tools that a team must have is a good working relationship.

Going into a group environment and believing that conflict will never occur is naive. Team leaders and team members should be mindful that conflict ''does'' and ''will'' arise. The goal is to effectively resolve the conflict and get the team back to working effectively.

Team members should never ignore conflict within the group when it surfaces. They should not just hope that it will go away or resolve itself. They must not assume that if they don't bring the problem up that the group can still function without resolving the issues at hand. Problems that are ignored and continue to fester will just cause ineffectiveness in the team. A problem that is ignored may also explode at a most inconvenient time and destroy the group altogether. Conflicts, especially interpersonal conflicts, need to be dealt with as soon as they are discovered, in an appropriate manner, so that the team can get back to work and effectively meet its goals.

There are generally considered two types of conflicts that arise in a group. The first is task conflict and the second is relationship conflict. Task conflict is described as disagreements on how to proceed, or a disagreement on what tasks should be preformed to meet the end goal. Relationship conflicts are personal issues that arise between members. They revolve around personal disagreements or dislikes between individuals in a team and rarely have much to do with the actual project.

Task conflicts are generally beneficial. These conflicts may be discussions on “how to improve a process, make the product better, provide a better service, or improve client relationships.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Topchik |first= Gary S. |title= [[First-Time Manager’s Guide to Team Building]] |publisher= [[AMACOM]] |year= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of conflicts are considered productive and discussions on such topics generally lead to the most constructive outcomes. “What usually results from productive conflicts are better, new, or different solutions to the concerns and issues the conflicting parties are having.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Topchik |first= Gary S. |title= [[First-Time Manager’s Guide to Team Building]] |publisher= [[AMACOM]] |year= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If task conflicts are not monitored and mediated by a team leader, these conflicts can become relationship conflicts. Care must be taken to ensure that task conflicts remain about the issues and don’t become personal. Relationship conflicts arise from a disagreement or conflict involving “personality, work style, or differences in beliefs or values.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Topchik |first= Gary S. |title= [[First-Time Manager’s Guide to Team Building]] |publisher= [[AMACOM]] |year= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Crawley described business conflict within a team as “a condition between or among workers whose jobs are interdependent, who feel angry, who perceive the other(s) as being at fault, and who act in ways that cause a business problem.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Crawley |first= John |title= [[Constructive Conflict management]] |publisher= [[Pfeiffer &amp; Company]] |year= 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also describes a workplace conflict as containing each of the same following elements:
#They are interdependent
#They blame each other
#They are angry
#Their behavior is causing a business problem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Crawley |first= John |title= [[Constructive Conflict management]] |publisher= [[Pfeiffer &amp; Company]] |year= 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gary Topchik, in his First-Time Manager’s Guide to Team Building, states that when team members become “critical of another team member’s actions, behaviors, or appearance, this is unproductive conflict that must be resolved very quickly. If not, the team will become self-destructive.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Topchik |first= Gary S. |title= [[First-Time Manager’s Guide to Team Building]] |publisher= [[AMACOM]] |year= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===What can you do?===
It is improbable that anyone will go through their life without having to deal with conflict in one form or another. The same can be said of a team; eventually every member of a team will face a disagreement, differences or conflict. So the question is what to do.
“The productive resolution of conflict usually strengthens relationships, whereas destructive confrontation, e.g., blaming, name calling, usually destroys relationships, or at the very least, detracts from their satisfaction and usefulness. Thus it is very important how you confront the conflict once you have decided to do so.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bercovitch |first= Jacob |title= [[Resolving Interpersonal Conflict]] |publisher= [[The American University]] |year= 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In When Teams Work Best, the authors describe first the questions and then the answers to “building and sustaining collaborative team relationships.”  They begin by describing the “four underlying characteristics of good relations”  as:
#They are constructive
#They are productive
#They embrace mutual understanding
#They are constructively self-correcting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= LaFasto |first= Frank |coauthors= Carl Larson |title= [[When Teams Work Best]] |publisher= Sage Publications, Inc |year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Next they offer four questions that “form the basis for assessing the degree to which an interaction contributes to building a good relationship.” 
#Did we have a constructive conversation?
#Was the conversation productive enough to make a difference?
#Did we understand and appreciate each other’s perspective?
#Did we both commit to making improvements?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= LaFasto |first= Frank |coauthors= Carl Larson |title= [[When Teams Work Best]] |publisher= Sage Publications, Inc |year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Which leads to what they call the CONNECT model.&lt;br&gt;
'''C'''	Commit to the relationship&lt;br&gt;
'''O'''	Optimize Safety&lt;br&gt;
'''N'''	Narrow the discussion to one issue&lt;br&gt;
'''N'''	Neutralize defensiveness&lt;br&gt;
'''E'''	Explain and echo each perspective&lt;br&gt;
'''C'''	Change one behavior each&lt;br&gt;
'''T'''	Track it!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= LaFasto |first= Frank |coauthors= Carl Larson |title= [[When Teams Work Best]] |publisher= Sage Publications, Inc |year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

*The relationship we have with this supplier is essentially 'evergreen'.
*It is assumed that renewal of agreements in this relationship will occur.
*The parties make plans not only for terms of current purchases, but also for the continuance of the relationship.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Function machine''' is a popular metaphor for visualizing input and output of a procedure, or the idea of a function, and related notions. It is accessible to toddlers, yet is robust enough to be taken to college-level work.

== History and Known Uses ==
...

== What is Being Visualized ==
* Input and output
* Function

== Visualization Techniques ==
The basic visual metaphor is a machine that &quot;does something&quot; to objects that enter into one of its openings, and exit through another. In this form, it immediately supports:
* Input and output
* Inverse functions (&quot;machine working backwards&quot;)
* Domain and range (&quot;what can go into the machine and what can come out&quot;)

Extensions of the metaphor include:
* Iteration and cycles(&quot;a tube connecting the output of the machine to the input&quot;)
* Multi-variable functions (&quot;many input openings&quot;)
* Composition of functions (&quot;two or more machines attached together&quot;)

The '''Khan Academy''' has video material relating to this topic which you may find easier to follow:
* [http://www.khanacademy.org/video/the-pythagorean-theorem?playlist=Geometry The Pythagorean Theorem], gives the theorem.
* [http://www.khanacademy.org/video/pythagorean-theorem-ii?playlist=Geometry Pythagorean Theorem II], has worked through exercise on this topic.

==The Theorem==

[[File:Rtriangle.svg|left|thumb|upright=0.8|A right-angle triangle]]  

In a right triangle (''right-angled triangle'') the longest side is always furthest away from the right angle.  It is called the '''hypotenuse'''.  The length of the hypotenuse can be calculated from the lengths of the two other sides.  In the diagram, ''c'' is the hypotenuse and we can calculate it from ''a'' and ''b''.  

This is a statement of the '''Pythagorean Theorem''' or '''Pythagoras' Theorem''' - as an equation relating the lengths of the sides ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'':&lt;ref name=Sally0&gt;

{{cite book |title=Roots to research: a vertical development of mathematical problems |author=Judith D. Sally, Paul Sally |page=63 |chapter=Chapter 3: Pythagorean triples |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nHxBw-WlECUC&amp;pg=PA63
|isbn=0821844032 |year=2007 |publisher=American Mathematical Society Bookstore}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle a^2 + b^2 = c^2\!\,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''c'' represents the length of the hypotenuse, and ''a'' and ''b'' represent the lengths of the other two sides.

This only works for right triangles!

{{clear}}

For the right angle triangle with corners labelled by A,B,C as shown, the following says the same thing:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{BC}^2 + \overline{AC}^2 = \overline{AB}^2&lt;/math&gt;

All we've done here is just use a different notation for the sides ''a'', ''b'' and ''c''.

===Geometrical Interpretation===
[[File:Pythagorean.svg|thumb|The Pythagorean theorem: The sum of the areas of the two squares on the legs (''a'' and ''b'') equals the area of the square on the hypotenuse (''c'').]]
We can also show this equation with a diagram, as on the right, where each side of a right angle triangle has a square attached to it.  This is the geometrical interpretation of the Pythagorean theorem, looking at the theorem as a theorem about areas.  The areas of the smaller squares add up to the area of the larger square.

In terms of areas, the Pythagorean Theorem states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In any right triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (the two sides that meet at a right angle).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The two ways of talking about the Pythagorean theorem amount to exactly the same thing, since the area of a square is just the length of one side squared.

==History of the Theorem==
[[File:Pythagoras-Münz.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Pythagoras, depicted on a 3rd-century coin]]
The Pythagorean theorem is named after the Greek mathematician Pythagoras, who by tradition is credited with its discovery and proof,&lt;ref name=Allman2&gt;

{{cite book |title=Greek Geometry from Thales to Euclid |author=George Johnston Allman |page=26 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=-gYCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA26 |publisher=Hodges, Figgis, &amp; Co |year=1889 |quote=The discovery of the law of three squares, commonly called the &quot;theorem of Pythagoras&quot; is attributed to him by&amp;nbsp;– amongst others&amp;nbsp;– Vitruvius, Diogenes Laertius, Proclus, and Plutarch ... |edition=Reprinted by Kessinger Publishing LLC 2005 |isbn=143260662X}}

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;heath144&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Heath|1921|loc= Vol I, p. 144}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is often argued that knowledge of the theorem predates him. There is much evidence that Babylonian mathematicians understood the formula.&lt;ref name=Neugebauer&gt;

{{cite book |title=The exact sciences in antiquity |page=36 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=JVhTtVA2zr8C&amp;pg=PA36

That notion is pretty much laid to rest by {{cite journal |author=Eleanor Robson |title=Words and Pictures: New Light on Plimpton 322  |year=2002 |doi= 10.2307/2695324|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2695324 |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly |volume=109 |issue=2 |pages=105–120 |publisher=Mathematical Association of America |ref=harv}} See also [http://www.dma.ulpgc.es/profesores/pacheco/Robson.pdf pdf file]. The accepted view today is that the Babylonians had no awareness of trigonometric functions.

==Three Worked Examples==

{{TrigBoxOpen}}
&lt;b&gt;In a ''right'' triangle&lt;br/&gt;
The square of the hypotenuse &lt;br/&gt;
is equal to &lt;br/&gt;
the sum of the squares of the other two sides.&lt;/b&gt;
{{TrigBoxClose}}

{{ExampleRobox|title=Example 1}}
An often used example for the Pythagorean Theorem is a right triangle in which &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle a=3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle b=4&lt;/math&gt; 
because the numbers come out particularly nicely:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\begin{matrix}
 a^2 + b^2 &amp; = &amp; \\
 3^2 + 4^2 &amp; = &amp; \\
   9 + 16  &amp; = &amp; 25
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--extra blank line--&gt;

So 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle c^2=25&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle c=\sqrt{25}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle c=5&lt;/math&gt;
{{Robox/Close}}

{{ExampleRobox|title=Example 2}}
Another often used example is a right triangle in which the two remaining angles are &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 45^\circ&lt;/math&gt; and both &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle a=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle b=1&lt;/math&gt;.
This time the answer doesn't come out as a whole number:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\begin{matrix}
 a^2 + b^2 &amp; = &amp; \\
 1^2 + 1^2 &amp; = &amp; \\
   1 + 1  &amp; = &amp; 2
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--extra blank line--&gt;

So 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle c^2=2&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle c=\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;

and we can stop here, or else give the answer as a decimal.

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle c\approx 1.414&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;\approx&lt;/math&gt; symbol means 'approximately'.
{{Robox/Close}}

{{ExampleRobox|title=Example 3}}
One more example a right triangle in which the shorter sides are &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle p=11&lt;/math&gt; cm and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle q=7&lt;/math&gt; cm.  

What's this about &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle q&lt;/math&gt;?  It really doesn't matter what letter we use to name the lengths of the sides as long as we are consistent.  The formula in the blue box still holds.  In this case we could call the hypotenuse &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle r&lt;/math&gt;, and so we have &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle p^2+q^2=r^2&lt;/math&gt;.  

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\begin{matrix}
 p^2 + q^2 &amp; = &amp; \\
 11^2 + 7^2 &amp; = &amp; \\
  121 + 49  &amp; = &amp; 170
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--extra blank line--&gt;

So 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle r^2=170&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle r=\sqrt{170}&lt;/math&gt; cm

and giving the answer as a decimal.

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle r\approx 13.04&lt;/math&gt; cm

===Does the answer make sense?===

It's worth checking the answer makes some kind of sense.  If the short sides are 11&amp;nbsp;cm and 7&amp;nbsp;cm is it reasonable that the long side is about 13&amp;nbsp;cm?  Yes, it is.  If you'd got an answer of 20&amp;nbsp;cm (or 170&amp;nbsp;cm) it would be unreasonable.  The two other sides won't stretch that far.  Or if the answer were 11&amp;nbsp;cm or less than you'd know that you hadn't got the length of the hypotenuse, the longest side.  We're OK here with this answer of 13.04&amp;nbsp;cm, which we probably should round down to 13&amp;nbsp;cm.

==In 3D==
[[File:Pythagoras 3D.PNG|thumb|Pythagoras' theorem in three dimensions relates the diagonal AD to the three sides.]]

Pythagoras' theorem can be applied to three dimensions as follows. 

Consider the rectangular solid shown in the figure. The length of diagonal ''BD'' along the floor of the rectangular solid is found from Pythagoras' theorem as:

:&lt;math&gt; \overline{BD}^{\,2} = \overline{BC}^{\,2} + \overline{CD}^{\,2} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;

where these three sides form a right triangle. Using horizontal diagonal ''BD'' and the vertical edge ''AB'', the length of diagonal ''AD'' then is found by a second application of Pythagoras' theorem as:

:&lt;math&gt; \overline{AD}^{\,2} = \overline{AB}^{\,2} + \overline{BD}^{\,2} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
or, doing it all in one step:
:&lt;math&gt; \overline{AD}^{\,2} = \overline{AB}^{\,2} + \overline{BC}^{\,2} + \overline{CD}^{\,2}  \ .&lt;/math&gt;

This result is the three-dimensional expression for the diagonal &lt;math&gt;\overline{AD}&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the three mutually perpendicular sides.

This one-step formula may be viewed as a generalization of Pythagoras' theorem to higher dimensions. However, this result is really just the repeated application of the original Pythagoras' theorem.

==The Pyramid of Khafre==

{{ExampleRobox|title=An Example in 3 Dimensions}}

[[File:01 khafre north.jpg|thumb|350px|The Khafre Pyramid; 274 cubits high; base 412 x 412 cubits]]
[[File:Pyramid-Calc.svg|thumb|350px|Lines and labels for working out the length of the sloping edge '''AC''']]
This example is in three dimensions and again we have to use the Pythagorean Theorem twice.

The great pyramid of Khafre is 274 cubits high.  It has a square base and the square has sides of length 412 cubits.  What is the length of the sloping diagonal edge from a corner up to the summit?

* To answer this question we work in two stages.  See the diagram.
* The line &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AO}&lt;/math&gt; is vertical and the line &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{OB}&lt;/math&gt; is horizontal, so there is a right angle triangle with sides &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AO}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{OB}&lt;/math&gt;.  This lets us calculate the length &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt;.
* We need to be careful.  &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AO}&lt;/math&gt; is 274 cubits, but &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{OB}&lt;/math&gt; is half the length of the side of the square, so &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{OB}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 412/2 = 206&lt;/math&gt; cubits.

&lt;!--Spacer--&gt;

What is the length of the hypotenuse &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt; of the triangle &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\triangle AOB&lt;/math&gt;? Well,

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\begin{matrix}
 \overline{AO}^2 + \overline{OB}^2 &amp; = &amp; \\
 274^2 + 206^2 &amp; = &amp; \\
 75,076 + 42,436  &amp; = &amp; 117,512
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--extra blank line--&gt;

So 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AB}^2=117,512&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AB}=\sqrt{117,512}&lt;/math&gt; cubits

We've made progress, but we want the length &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AC}&lt;/math&gt;, not the length &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt;.  

* Now we have another right angle triangle, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\triangle ABC&lt;/math&gt; with the right angle at B.  We want the length &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AC}&lt;/math&gt;.  We have just calculated &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt; and we know, because the base of the pyramid is a square, that &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{BC}&lt;/math&gt; is once again 206 cubits.  This time &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AC}&lt;/math&gt; is the hypotenuse (of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\triangle ABC&lt;/math&gt;). So

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\begin{matrix}
 \overline{AB}^2 + \overline{BC}^2 &amp; = &amp; \\
 \sqrt{117,512}^2 + 206^2 &amp; = &amp; \\
 117,512 + 42,436  &amp; = &amp; 159,948
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--extra blank line--&gt;

So 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AC}^2=159,948&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AC}=\sqrt{159,948}&lt;/math&gt; cubits

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AC}\approx 400&lt;/math&gt; cubits

{{Robox/Close}}

==Other forms==
As pointed out in the introduction, if ''c'' denotes the length of the hypotenuse and ''a'' and ''b'' denote the lengths of the other two sides, Pythagoras' theorem can be expressed as the Pythagorean equation:

: &lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2\, &lt;/math&gt;

or, solved for ''c'':

: &lt;math&gt; c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

That is what we have been doing in all the examples above.  We are using the shorter sides to work out what the length of the hypotenuse is.

If the hypotenuse ''c'' is known, and the length of one of the legs must be found, the following equations can be used:

: &lt;math&gt;b = \sqrt{c^2 - a^2}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

or

: &lt;math&gt;a = \sqrt{c^2 - b^2}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

The Pythagorean equation provides a simple relation among the three sides of a right triangle so that if the lengths of any two sides are known, the length of the third side can be found.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Ingredient}}

Safflower oil is flavorless and colorless, and nutritionally similar to sunflower oil. It is used mainly in cosmetics and as a cooking oil, in salad dressing, and for the production of margarine. It may also be taken as a nutritional supplement.

[[File:Tuerkischer safran.jpg|thumb|left|Safflower purchased at a market in Turkey]]
Safflower flowers are occasionally used in cooking as a cheaper substitute for saffron, and are thus sometimes referred to as &quot;bastard saffron.&quot;  

There are two types of safflower that produce different kinds of oil: one high in monounsaturated fatty acid (oleic acid) and the other high in polyunsaturated fatty acid (linoleic acid). Currently the predominant oil market is for the former, which is lower in saturates than olive oil, for example.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.

{{Meteorology_TOC|show=ch12|float=right}}

==Where they form==
Tropical cyclones form in all hemispheres, although their activity is concentrated in certain areas. The ocean basins in which tropical cyclones most commonly form in are the Northern Indian, Western Pacific, Central Pacific Eastern Pacific, Northern Atlantic, Southern Pacific, Australian Region, and Southwestern Indian. Elsewhere, storms are rare; for example, only two officially-recognized TCs have formed in the Southern Atlantic. This storm occurred in March 2004 and struck Brazil and offshore Brazil in March 2010. Dubbed Catarina, its wind speeds reached 100 miles per hour, or 155 kilometers per hour; the latter was dubbed Anita. 

===Northern Hemisphere===
The Northern Indian Ocean is responsible for fueling extremely destructive and deadly tropical cyclones, including the deadliest storm worldwide. TCs in this region tend to form between April and December, and their designations vary based on their intensity. Weaker systems are dubbed &quot;depressions&quot; or &quot;deep depressions&quot;, while the most intense are known as &quot;very severe cyclonic storms&quot;. In 2008, Cyclone Nargis struck Myanmar, causing large-scale devastation. 

The Western Pacific sees the most storms; its season runs year-round, and mature tropical cyclones here are called &quot;typhoons&quot;. Typhoons, including weaker tropical storms, may number in the dozens every year, and can grow to monstrous sizes and strengths. Typhoon Tip in 1979 holds the record for the strongest tropical cyclone in the world, bearing 1-minute sustained winds of 190 miles per hour. Its pressure sunk to 870 millibars; for comparison, the average air pressure at sea level is over 140 millibars higher. Tip struck Japan after weakening over water.

Hurricanes in the Eastern Pacific are also prolific. Hurricane season has an official boundary in this basin: May 15 to November 31. Nonetheless, storms have been known to occur outside these limits. While hurricanes often strengthen into major cyclones, they usually drift westward and dissipate at sea, causing no major harm to land. Occasionally they recurve northward and strike Mexico or even the United States, though almost always at weakened states. In October 2002, Hurricane Kenna moved ashore on the Mexican state of Nayarit, inflicting substantial damage. In the Central Pacific, hurricanes are much less common, and any storms present in this area usually enter from the Eastern Pacific. Hawaii and Johnston Atoll are the only land in the path of storms.

Storms in the Northern Atlantic, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, are also referred to as &quot;hurricanes&quot;. Each season, defined as between June 1 and November 31, contains an average of around 10 named tropical storms. However, during the 2005 season, 28 storms warranted naming. Most commonly observed in the month of September, hurricanes in the Atlantic often affect land. Among them was Hurricane Katrina, an extremely powerful and catastrophic cyclone that struck the United States in August 2005. Its impact included upwards of $80 billion in damage and approximately 1,836 fatalities.  

===Southern Hemisphere===
The Southern Hemisphere is comprised of three main tropical cyclone basins: the Southwestern Indian (west of west of 90°E), the Australian Region (between 90°E and 160°E), and the Southern Pacific (east of 160°E). The Southern Pacific cyclone season officially runs between December 1 and April 30. On average, 9 tropical cyclones form every season, of which 4.5 will intensify into severe tropical cyclones. The most intense cyclone ever recorded was named Zoe, and formed during December 2002, extending into the following year.

Cyclones in Australia tend to form between November 1 and April 30. The strongest storm ever recorded in the are was Cyclone Gwenda, which occurred during April 1999; other severe storms include cyclones Inigo, George, and Orson. 

Finally, in the Southwest Indian, the official cyclone season extends from November 15 to April 30. Storms here commonly impact Madagascar and parts of Africa.

'''Bamboo shoots''' are the edible shoots (new bamboo culms that come out of the ground) of the bamboo species ''Bambusa vulgaris'' and ''Phyllostachys edulis''. They are used in numerous Asian dishes and broths, and are available in supermarkets in various sliced forms, both fresh and canned versions. 

[[File:Bamboo sprouts in basket.jpg|thumb|Whole bamboo shoots after being harvested]]

In Indonesia, they are sliced thinly to be boiled with coconut milk and spices to make a dish named ''gulai rebung''. Other recipes using bamboo shoots are ''sayur lodeh'' (mixed vegetables in coconut milk) and ''lun pia'': fried wrapped bamboo shoots  with vegetables). Note that the shoots of some species contain cyanide that need to be leached or boiled out before they can be eaten safely. Slicing the bamboo shoots thinly assists in this leaching.

Pickled bamboo, used as a condiment, may also be made from the pith of the young shoots.

In India, bamboo shoots are part of the traditional cuisine, used in a wide variety of dishes - among which are iromba, ooti and kangshu ar eto.

In Nepal, they are used in dishes, which have been well-known in Nepal for centuries. A popular dish is Tama (fermented), with आलु (Potato), बोडी (Beans). In Vietnamese cuisine, shredded bamboo shoots are used alone or with other vegetable in many stir-fried vegetable dishes. It may also be used as the sole vegetable ingredient in pork chop soup.

In Philippine cuisine, they are called &quot;Labong&quot;.  Two most popular dish for this is the &quot;Ginataang Labong&quot; (labong with coconut milk and chilies) and &quot;Dinengdeng na Labong&quot; (labong in fish bagoong with string beans, saluyot, and tinapa).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{cuisine}}

Northern Irish food is generally heavily influenced by both Irish and British cuisine - A local interpretation of Irish stew consisting of either diced steak or minced beef is regularly eaten in the province, as is Fish and chips. However there are a few exceptions that are unique to Northern Ireland and difficult to find among either. A few examples include The 'Ulster Fry'- a Northern Irish interpretation of the English breakfast that traditionally includes Wheaten and/or Soda Bread. Another is 'pasties' often available at chip shops in Northern Ireland (not to confused with Cornish pasties), which consists of a burger-like patty made from minced pork and peppered vegetables deep fried in batter. It is often served in a bap and referred to as a 'pastie bap' or simply served with chips and referred to as a 'pastie supper'. A mainstay among Northern Irish dinners is 'Champ' - Or spring onions ('scallions' as they are often known as in the 6 counties) boiled in milk and mixed in with mashed potatoes with a bit of butter, often served as a compliment to a main ingredient such as steak or pork chops.

== Global Sysop vote ==

What's with all the constant questioning of everybody who has added an 'oppose' vote for the Global Sysop proposal?  Why are these people (including myself) being harassed?  Let people have their say and move on.  I don't see lots of questions being asked of those who've voted in support of the proposal?--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:15, 7 January 2010 (UTC)
:The point is they need to ''say'' why they oppose. I've been working on this series of proposals for probably a year, maybe more. It is insulting that people would not give due consideration. Asking for that is not harassment. The reason I haven't asked supporters for the same is because they are indicating agreement with the proposal - which outlines very precisely the rationale. Some have included additional reasoning, which is even better. &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:03, 7 January 2010 (UTC)

Peace. [[meta:User talk:Seb az86556]]

==Global sysop amendment==
hello Mike. Thank you for your constructive comments on the section I added to the global sysop-vote (&quot;proposal to amend wording&quot;). You bring up a good point about granting permanent sysop-ship as well. Please see my comment in that section for further discussion. I highly appreciate your cooperation.

==Accusing==
I went through ANI regarding this individual.  If you want to look through my recent history you will see it, but since this is public I will not name names.  I was asked to stop, I have stopped the proceedings.   You can contact me at trackinfoorg at yahoo if you wish.  Nothing was solved.  My conclusion is:  Administrators will just protect their own.  We mere editors have little say.  I raised the issue not because of my stub article, but because of the obvious history this guy has.  That &quot;habit&quot; was not dealt with and in fact, was praised.

This great plan you are so heavily advocating will result in empowering more of these monsters to arbitrarily delete things--without using the procedures in place.  One powerful person's opinion outweighs the ability of another to defend their work.  That is not how consensus is achieved or how WP should work.  Power corrupts.[[User:Trackinfo|Trackinfo]] ([[User talk:Trackinfo|talk]]) 21:26, 15 January 2010 (UTC)
:We currently have a group of fewer people with more power. The proposal aims to spread it out more, and you somehow think that's a problem? &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:54, 16 January 2010 (UTC)

== GSysop ==
Just a few clarification, nothing important or urgent (you can even point me to the right pages and I'll look them over), that is missing on that discussion or I couldn't find a mention of it.&lt;br&gt;
#If the proposal was adopted what projects would qualify for criteria?
#:[[m:Global sysops/wiki set]] (with additions/removals depending upon who opts-in/-out)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:46, 19 January 2010 (UTC)
#Why was it decided for a top down approach and not rely in each of the &quot;needy&quot; projects to call for outside help, this seems would be more representative and less bureaucratic.
#:The whole point is that these projects don't really have that capacity. That's also why we're trying to provide a hopefully-sane default for inclusion, while still allowing adjustment per-wiki as needed. Furthermore, the people doing this work are largely [[m:SWMT]] members -- and that group ''is'' calling for global sysops. Vocally. The main proposers all come from that group. &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:46, 19 January 2010 (UTC)
#I'm not aware on the procedures and qualifications but is this a sign that Wikimedia is creating too many projects or making it too easy to put them up without thinking on the wasting of good faith by volunteers and resources that could be better invested elsewhere?
#:No, I think the need for this reflects the maturation of the community. As we get older, we have fewer new contributors, which means fewer people countering vandalism. So, there's a need to have more people with privileged access sufficient to take up the slack. &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:46, 19 January 2010 (UTC)
Personally my intuited responses to those questions is what decided my vote. I think that due to the chaos that seems to be reigning on those pages clarifying this issues would help. I also have a particular dislike on how votes/pools outside of wikibooks are coordinated in general, I know here we (sadly) do not always do it formally but we at least can keep some order, its a freak show out-there...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 08:21, 19 January 2010 (UTC)
:I've replied inline for most.
:I do agree, the vote has become a bit of a cesspool - I don't envy the steward to has to read everything and come to a conclusion as to what consensus exists, if any. The main issue truly is a lack of understanding. For example, people are questioning that there is even a problem with vandalism. While that is self-evident to myself, and many others who do work in that area (and so we see it day in day out), it is not so evident to many. I wish there was an easy way we could show people something to prove there is a problem that needs fixing, but that is not so easy to do - the best way is to have them join us and see for themselves as it happens. But that isn't likely to occur. Likewise, actually reading and understanding the proposal is a problem. People have been complaining that there is no restriction like &quot;vandalism only&quot; -- but that is exactly what &quot;urgent abuse&quot; refers to. We simply used that to include spam and malbots and ... so on. In fact, most complaints are actually dealt with in the proposal.

::Thanks for the info. It changed a bit my position on the subject and if the clarification is added (regarding the default opt-in, and how to get out of it) I'll remove my opposition. I still think the general approach is bad but also understand the issue with vandalism, so there is a need for balance and because you said the push for the proposal to pass is coming from projects that are affected, then it isn't my place to block it.&lt;br&gt;
::The reasons I'm still in disagree result from the creation of the function. The communities that should care for the each project will loses some control over them (or diverted form exerting it).
::Fighting vandalism also shows what fragilities exist and by reducing the need for them to take responsibility then few will decide to take a more active role on those projects (that is why I agree with some of the opinions that if there isn't enough critical mass projects should fold). Taking up bureaucratic tasks (not particularly using the tools) isn't the major motivator for people to join the project in the first place but is as important or more than only contributing content, it is also more time sensitive and requires a greater commitment. This is why I'm also discontent with abolishing of the patrolling of pages here, it provided a reason for people to understand what is going on beyond their pet projects and move from a being a simpler user to a full member of the community. Most of our promotions for the other tools came from that group of people.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:03, 20 January 2010 (UTC)

Mike,

I need some help knowing what it is that the staff of Wiki want from us regarding the copyright on this material.  I thought we just took care of this with one of the other admins. I'm not sure what exactly you took issue with regarding the link you sent, there is some similar wording but I assure you that all of the content of the document has been reviewed by attorneys and is perfectly legal for us to post in this realm, as it is owned by the Maryland State Bar Association.  A group which consists of business and COPYRIGHT attorneys and I was told that all I had to do was make the link on the first page and that would take care of the issue.  As you can see, I did link to the MSBA website, and I will properly cite any text that is determined to be derived from a government document, but please keep in mind that I am new to this and still do not have your system completely figured out yet, so I am somewhat slow in my edits.  Please feel free to call me and discuss any legal issues you have with this publication as I am an attorney and I am sure that we can clear up any concerns that the Wiki people have with our submission.

Thank you,

Bill McComas

:Probably just a coincidence that I found some matching text then - no problem. We just need you to email {{email|info|wikibooks.org}} saying that all the copyright holders release their work under the site license (cc-by-sa). I know you've done this on-wiki, but we need you to do it by email, using an email address associated with the Maryland State Bar Association. Otherwise, you could be anybody - and getting away with copyright infringement.

Thank you for your reply, I will have someone email you as soon as possible from the MSBA to confirm that this is a collaborative work created by the attorneys that are involved with the project.  I appreciate your diligence in monitoring the copyrights for wiki, and apologize if I was curt in my reply, I was just getting very frustrated with trying to comb through all of your pages to get an answer to what exactly you all wanted or needed from us to post this publication, and for someone that is not as technically literate as it appears everyone else is on this site, I was just trying to get the thing up so people could see it, and as soon as I typed something it seemed you all were mighty quick on the trigger.  I would appreciate it if we could take down the huge signs on the site that accuse us of copyright infringement in the meantime as it is defaming to our organization to accuse us without verification.  

Thank you for your help in this matter, once again, I invite you to call me with any further concerns that you may have regarding the posted publication.
Bill McComas Esq.

oh and p.s. I will work on splitting it up into smaller sections once I get the information posted, and if you could rename the publication to The Maryland Entrepreneur's Guide I would very much appreciate it.

Thanks again
:Done &amp; done. Thanks for taking care of this - there's no real rush, the text isn't going anywhere while you get someone to email us. &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:15, 14 February 2010 (UTC)

Thank you for your help, I will work on the rest of the subsections, and you should be receiving the email soon from the MSBA.

== [[Special:Contributions/Jkelly952|k-12math.info]] ==

Quite a few pages have been created recently (they stand out too, in all-caps) with links to k-12math.info.  I do not see an appropriate license on that page and suspect these additions are to promote this website.  While [[User:Jkelly952|Jkelly952]] states that he is Jim Kelly, at the very least these need to have an OTRS notification, but this could be link spam. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:12, 15 February 2010 (UTC)


What is an OTRS notification? I use a .info extension because the purpose of my site is to provide information, with no distraction or screen space being taken up with advertising. And I am not sure what &quot;link spam&quot; is ? Sorry if my 68 year old mind does not fully understand - I am just trying to provide information. -- Jim Kelly [[User:Jkelly952|Jkelly952]]
:OTRS is just the way of raising a request (open ticket request system). If you read [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission|here]] on Wikipedia it explains how to request copyright permission. It's easy to infer from here how you also give the permission to reuse your material. The book if created here should not have &quot;k-12math.info&quot; as the name because this is &quot;link spam&quot;. That is, it relates the name of a web site (k-12math.info) directly to Wikibooks. It is also not a sensible name for a book. For example, if you wrote a paper book about Wikibooks you wouldn't title it ''en.wikibooks.org'', you'd call it &quot;Wikibooks&quot;. Similarly you should find a more descriptive name for your text book that doesn't appear to promote your web site. You should also read the guide to structuring books here as the pages should be named in a way that links them together.

I don't see anything at [[k-12math.info]] - am I missing something? I'll look into any link additions though. @Jkelly952: you can email {{email|info|wikibooks.org}} with a release for the copyright on anything you add to Wikibooks that's been previously published elsewhere. &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:10, 14 March 2010 (UTC)

[[Special:Contributions/Cro-mag rally registration code : AMAHFJDHFMAM|User:Cro-mag rally registration code : AMAHFJDHFMAM]] may appear as a problem elsewhere.

== G'day Mike ==

As a very new chap over here on wikibooks, I don't really feel that I should join in the discussion about the unblock of thekohser, which I would support, but I did think it was worth popping in here to ask about your recent request to remove your checkuser rights on this project.

I just had a bit of a chat about this on the stewards IRC channel (really to learn about how the various rights work etc.) and I thought I'd follow it up by popping in here. I'm sure you'd be aware that there's a risk of a 'fishy' appearance to your stepping down, because of the simultaneous request to remove Adrignola's rights, due to there no longer being two checkusers - and in part due to your technical ability, as a steward, to restore your checkuser rights if you felt there was an emergency (perhaps if a 'globally banned' user was active ;-) - anywhoo, I thought your take on the whole thing was worth asking for - and I think it'd probably be best to explicitly state it if you've decided not to use checkuser on this wiki under any circumstances - which I personally feel would be for the best :-) cheers, [[User:Privatemusings|Privatemusings]] ([[User talk:Privatemusings|talk]]) 06:23, 13 August 2010 (UTC)

[[file:Figaro Liquid Smoke.jpg|thumb|197px|A bottle of liquid smoke]]

'''Liquid smoke''' is a substance produced from smoke passed through water. Liquid smoke is used for both food preservation and flavouring. Liquid smoke consists of smoke produced through the controlled burning of wood chips or sawdust, condensed and then passed through water, which captures and dissolves the smoke-flavoured components in solution. This base can be condensed and modified through many methods to develop a wide range of smoke flavours.

== Uses ==

Liquid smoke is often used in the processing of bacon and hot dogs, and is one of the main flavours in the curing solution used for bacon. It is also used to flavour jerky and tofu. Liquid smoke is also used in some soft cheeses and tempeh.</text>

'''Modified starch''' is a food additive which is prepared by treating starch or starch granules, causing the starch to be partially degraded. Modified starch is used as a thickening agent, stabilizer, or an emulsifier. Starches are modified for a number of reasons. Starches may be modified to increase their stability against excessive heat, acid, shear, time and cooling or freezing; to change their texture; to decrease the viscosity, or to lengthen or shorten gelatinization time. 

'''Acid-treated starch''' (E1401), usually simply called &quot;modified starch&quot;, is prepared by treating starch or starch granules with inorganic acids, breaking down the starch molecule and thus reducing the viscosity.

Other treatments may produce modified starch with different E numbers, such as alkaline-modified starch (E1402), bleached starch (E1403), oxidized starch (E1404), enzyme-treated starch, acetylated starch (E1420), and acetylated oxidized starch (E1451).

Pre-gelatinized starch is used to thicken instant desserts, allowing the food to thicken with the addition of cold water or milk. Similarly, cheese sauce granules (such as in Macaroni and Cheese or lasagna) or gravy granules may be thickened with boiling water without the product going lumpy. Commercial pizza toppings containing modified starch will thicken when heated in the oven, keeping them on top of the pizza, and then become runny when cooled.</text>

This formula was first published in Danxi Xinfa (Danxi's Experiential Therapy). Its Chinese name (虎潜丸, pinyin: hǔ qián wán) literally means &quot;Tiger Dive Pill&quot;. The herbs in this formula were typically ground into powder and made into boluses with honey for oral application.

==Ingredients==

The ingredients of Xiao Chaihu Tang are:
# Huangbai - 150g
# Zhiguiban - 120g
# Chaozhimu - 60g
# Shudihuang - 60g
# Chenpi - 60g

This formula was used for tuberculosis of the knee joint, myodystrophy, perpheral palsy, poliomyelitis sequel, and flaccidity of the lower limbs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Exception handling ==
There are two main ways to [[w:Exception handling|handle errors]] in code, in order to avoid to stop the program when they occur.

=== &lt;code&gt;On Error GoTo&lt;/code&gt; ===
The older method used in VBA is &quot;unstructured&quot; error handling, still available via the &lt;code&gt;On Error GoTo&lt;/code&gt; syntax, because it uses a [[w:Goto|Goto]] toward a label. This is still useful in certain circumstances where you wish to &lt;code&gt;Resume&lt;/code&gt; processing after handling the error. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
    Public Sub Main()
        On Error GoTo Label1
        Dim Result As Integer = 1
        Dim a = 1
        Dim b = 0
        Result = a / b  ' Division by zero
Label1:
        MessageBox.Show(Result)
    End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

To avoid to define the labels, it's possible to simply ask to ignore all errors, during a certain time, and reactivate them with &lt;code&gt;On Error GoTo 0&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
        On Error Resume Next
        Dim Result As Integer = 1
        Dim a = 1
        Dim b = 0
        Result = a / b
        On Error GoTo 0
        MessageBox.Show(Result)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== &lt;code&gt;Try...Catch...Finally&lt;/code&gt; ===
&quot;Structure error handling&quot; is available with the newer &lt;code&gt;Try...Catch...Finally&lt;/code&gt; syntax. Various error conditions are implemented via inheritors of the base &lt;code&gt;Exception&lt;/code&gt; class. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
    Public Sub Main()
        Dim Result As Integer = 1
        Dim a = 1
        Dim b = 0
        Try
            Result = a / b
        Catch ex As Exception
            MsgBox(ex.ToString)
        Finally
            MessageBox.Show(Result)
        End Try

HINT: If you wish to re-throw an exception inside a &lt;code&gt;Catch&lt;/code&gt; block, use the &lt;code&gt;Throw&lt;/code&gt; keyword without any arguments (particularly, do not use &quot;Throw ex&quot;). The Throw keyword resets the &lt;code&gt;.StackTrace&lt;/code&gt; property of the exception object if an argument is supplied. Throw, without any arguments inside a &lt;code&gt;Catch&lt;/code&gt; block will re-throw the error without resetting the &lt;code&gt;.StackTrace&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2010/03/04/too-much-reuse.aspx Eric Lippert's Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Time and Space ==

A simple sentience in Loglan only defines a relationship between the arguments but says nothing about where on when the relationship holds true. Unlike some natural languages, you can chose to add time and space to a sentence in Loglan or chose to leave it out. 

The Loglan sentence, ''mi viska tu'' means ''I see you'' or '' I was seen by you'' or ''I will see you''. English forces us to add in the time; was it past, present or future? But in Loglan ''mi viska tu'' can hold true if I see you now or I have seen you or even if I will see you at some point in the future. Loglan does not force you to refer to time or space. 

Loglan treats time and space the same. That means you place a relationship in time the same way that you place it in space; you add one of three words for time and one of three words for space. Whatever you can do with time words you can do with space words. 

For time we have the following three words:

* pa

* na

* fa


For space we have the following three words:

* vi

* va

* vu


=== pa, na, and fa ===

If we want to add time into a sentence Loglan provides us with three little words to do that; ''pa'', ''na'' and ''fa''. You can add theses little words anywhere in the sentence.

The little word ''pa'' refers to the past and means ''before''.

* mi vizka tu ''pa'' - I saw you

* mi ''pa'' vizka tu - I saw you

* ''pa'' mi vizka tu - I saw you

The little word ''na'' refers to now and means ''at the instance of''.

* mi ''na'' vizka tu - I see you now

The last of the three, ''fa'', refers to the future and means ''after''.

* mi vizka tu ''fa'' - I will see you

=== vi, va and vu ===

The little words ''vi'', ''va'' and ''vu'' indicate place and work like the words for time; they go anywhere in the sentence.

The little word ''vi'' means ''here'' or ''close to this place''

* mi viska tu ''vi'' - I see you here

* mi ''vi'' viska tu - I see you here

* ''vi'' mi viska tu - I see you here

The little word ''va'' means ''over there'' or ''nearby''.

* mi vizka tu ''va'' - I saw you nearby

The last little, ''vu'' word refers to a place far away; ''over there'' or ''yonder''.

* mi vizka tu ''vu'' - I saw you far away over there

=== zi, za, and zu ===

You can add more details to the time and space words using the ''zi'', ''za'', and ''zu'' little words. 

* zi - near or very short duration

* za - soon or a short duration

* zu - long time or long duration

so,

* fazi - very short time in the future

* vuzu - a very long distance away

* naza - in a little while

The context determines how long is long and how short is short. The existence of humans on Earth is a short time in geological ages but and hour might mean a long time to wait for a bus. 

=== Other Places and Other Times ===

The use of ''vi, va, vu'' and ''pa, na, fa'' defines time and place relative to the speaker. We can use the little word ''la'' to define a place or time relative to something else if we combine it with the place and time words.

* mi vizka tu ''lena'' kinkra - I saw you at the time of the convention

* mi ''lena kinkra'' gu vizka tu - I, at the time of the convention, saw you 

* mi vizka tu ''lefa'' kinkra - I will see you at the time of the convention

* mi vizka tu ''levi'' kinkra - I saw you at the place of the convention

* mi vizka tu ''leva'' kinkra - I saw you near the place of the convention

      <text xml:space="preserve">== EOS ==

The European Organisation for Sustainability (EOS) has a two part plan for an alternative socio-economic system; a people side and a technical side. The technical side manages all the technical aspects of society such as production, transportation, education and medical. The people side manages all non-technical aspects such as morality and culture aspects. For example, televisions has a both a technical and people side. On the technical side we have the design of cameras, recording equipment and broadcasting equipment. We also have technical standards to maintain and implement. However, what the system should broadcast, the actuarial television programme content, falls within the people side. From a technical point of view an engineer would need to do the same job regardless of programming but from a people point of view some programs might have a cultural acceptance but others might not. In the plan that EOS would propose each side would have a different form of management.

At the core of EOS's proposal lies the idea of sustainable. EOS aim for a socioeconomic system that offers a good standard of living for the longest time possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== People Side ===

Non-nation centric forms an important characteristic of the proposal that EOS presents. Instead of nations, EOS argues that culture and language form important attributes and thus proposes a system based on networks of communities of about 200 people in each. Each community would link up with a number of others to form an ''urbanate'' of about 10 000 people. An ''urbanate'' forms the proposed replacement for cities and forms a building block for the government of the people side. 

EOS recommends a direct democracy for administration of the people aspects of an urnbante. In such a system, the people would elect a governing body of representatives that would suggest laws. The people would then vote the laws in or out. If a sufficient group of people wish to change an established law then they can place that before the governing council. 

Direct democracy fors a suggestion. Urbanates could implement other forms of government for people aspects as they wish. However, each urbanate must maintain a set common ground; such as basic human rights and the right to move from urbanate to urbanate. In addition, no governing council could interfere with technical aspects of society. So, for example, a governing council could decide on what TV programs to show but not the design of the equipment. 

Urbanates with similar cultures or languages could join together if they so wished and form a confederacy. A confederacy would operate as if it were a single urbanate but each composing urbanate would have the right to leave as it wished.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Introduction'''
- Unobtrusive measures are ways of studying social behavior whithout affecting it in the process.  Unobtrusive research is simply the methods of studying social behaviorwithout affecting it.

- There are three types of unobtrusive research:
Content Analysis
Analysis of existing statistics
Comparative and historical analysis

'''Content Analysis'''
- With content analysis you focus on the details of recorded human communications.  For example you would analyze a painting a written document, photos, films, and things like face book.

- Appropriate topics include who says what, to whom, why, how, and with what effect.

  For example, if our unit of analysis is writers, then we can use units of observation like novels written by them, chapters and paragraphs of the novels, etc.

- Variable identification and measurement in content analysis depend on clarity of the unit of analysis.    

- Content Analysis involves coding which may attend to both manifest and latent content.  The determination of latent content requires judgements by the researcher. 

- Both quantitative and qualitative techniques are appropriate for interpreting content analysis data. 

- There are four characteristics that are usually coded in '''content analysis''':
1) '''Frequency''' - a count of the number of occurrences of a word, phrase, image, etc
2) '''Direction''' - the direction in meaning of the text content (e.g. positive vs negative or active vs passive)
3) '''Intensity''' - degree or strength of a text reference
4) '''Space''' - the size of the passage, image, or other content

- Strengths of content analysis:
-Research poses little to no harm on subjects
-Time efficient, cheap
-Allows researcher to correct mistakes
-Can look at processes occurring over time
-Good reliability

- Weaknesses of content analysis:
-Limited to what the researcher is able to record
-Validity can be limited

- In content analysis we could employ any conventional sampling technique like random, systematic, stratified, or clustered sampling.  When concerning sub-sampling, sampling needs not to end with our unit of analysis. For example, if our unit of analysis is writers, then we can use units of observation like novels written by them, chapters and paragraphs of the novels, etc.



'''Analyzing Existing Statistics'''
- With analysis of existing statistics, your focus would be mainly statistics of different studies without confusing this with secondary analysis which is just obtaining a copy of somebody's data and carrying out ones own analysis.

- When analyzing existing statistics, it may be the main source of data or a supplemental source of data. Most existing statistics come from governments and large intergovernmental organizations.  When describing the units of analysis, existing statistics describe groups.  You must be aware of the ecological fallacy.  This means making assumptions regarding individuals based on characteristics of entire population.

- Whenever we base research on an analysis of data that already exists we’re limited to what exists.  The existing data do not cover exactly what we are interested in, and our measurement may not be altogether valid representations of the variables and concepts we want to make conclusions about.  Two characteristics of science are used to handle the problem of validity in analysis of existing statistics: logical reasoning and replication.

- Problems of validity in the analysis of existing statistics can often be handled through logical reasoning and replication.

- Existing statistics often have problems of reliability, so they must be used with caution.


'''Comparative and Historical Research'''
- And lastly comparative and historical research which is the examination of societies (or other social units) over time and in comparison with one another. 

-  An example of comparative and historical research is the U.S. anthropologist, Lewis Morgan, who saw a progression in societies from &quot;savagery&quot; to &quot;barbarism&quot; to &quot;civilization.&quot;  Also Robert Redfield noticed the progression from &quot;folk society&quot; to &quot;urban society.&quot;  Pitirim Sorokin however respresnts a different form of this research.  He theorizes that societal trends follow a cycle pattern between two points of view.  One he called &quot;ideational&quot; and the other &quot;sensate.&quot;  Later he developed third point of view, which he called &quot;idealistic.&quot;


- Historical research and sociology often use the same tools and datasets as history, but they have different goals. 
'''historiography''' - methodology of doing historical research
The comparative historical method was the backbone of 19th century sociology. Sociologists such as Durkheim and Weber focused in on societies and studied and categorized them during different stages of development. In the mid-twentieth century, as the United States became the center of sociological research, the comparative historical method virtually disappeared.  It has been revived in the U.S. in the past 35 years by researchers inspired by the European sociological classics.

- There are two types of sources a researcher can use when conducting historical research.
1)'''primary sources''' - physical artifacts of human societies; (ex. documents, letters, official records, personal recollections)
2)'''secondary sources''' - books and papers published by governments and historians; (ex. statistical running records)  Examples of famous studies include Durkheim’s Study of Suicide and Kentor’Consequences of Globalization.  

- The unit of analysis of existing statistics describe groups.  Means you must be aware of the ecological fallacy which involves making assumptions regarding individuals based on characteristics of entire population.      


- Although often regarded as a qualitative method, comparative and historical research can make use of quantitative techniques.

- Archives are the most important type of comparative and historical reserach because they are well maintained by reliable organizations. However, they can by biased or partially incomplete.


'''Ethics and Unobtrusive Research'''
- While the use of unobtrusive research does avoid many ethical issues that are frequently present in other techniques of data collection and analysis, potential ethical risks still exist.  For example, the use of diaries or private communications in content analysis give rise to questions of confidentiality.

- Sometimes even unobtrusive measures can raise the possibility of violating subjects privacy.

- The general principles of honest observation, analysis, and reporting apply to all research techniques.

- - '''Traditional Approaches'''
- To conduct field research of the past, primarily using materials such as letters, diaries, documents, oral histories, etc. (often these are case studies and are not necessarily comparative)

- To study different societies, using the differences and similarities to highlight macro-social theories, primarily using history books and newspapers (the facts of history themselves). Often these are studies of current history and are not necessarily truly historical.

- The actual comparative study of societies and their development over long stretches of history using a variety of resources. This produces research that is both comparative and historical.

- Coding: Procedure of turning raw data into a standardized form that can be interpreted by a machine and processed/analyzed. E.g. A processed scantron for an exam.  Coding is the process whereby raw data are transformed into standardized form suitable for machine processing and analysis.  Content analysis is essentially a coding operation.  In content analysis, communications- oral, written, or other- are coded or classified according to some conceptual framework.  Coding in content analysis involves the logic of conceptualization and operation,  as in other research methods, you must refine your conceptual frameworks and develop specific methods for observing in relation to that framework.

- Latent Content: In connection with content analysis, the underlying means of communication. E.g. In a war movie, how effective the movie depicted actual combat via the flow of the movie scenes or the general reality of how well the war was captured on a subjective interpretation.  Latent content is as used in connection with content analysis, the underlying meaning of communications, as distinguished from their manifest content.

- Manifest Content: In connection with content analysis, the actual concrete terms within human communication. E.g. In a war movie, how many times &quot;fire&quot;, &quot;shoot&quot;, or &quot;bomb&quot; is said (concrete, objective terms).  Coding the manifest content, the visible surface content, of a communication is analogous to using a standardize questionnaire. Manifest coding is more reliable than latent coding, but is generally less valid


- Archives are the most important source for this type of research. They are maintained by governments, private foundations, and some corporations and families. They are repositories of documents, letters, photos, etc. Their primary purpose is preservation, not ease of access.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The formulation of his theorem seems a little odd to me.

;Theorem 1.9
A homomorphism is determined by its action on a basis. That is, if &lt;math&gt; \langle \vec{\beta}_1,\dots,\vec{\beta}_n \rangle  &lt;/math&gt; is a basis of a vector space &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \vec{w}_1,\dots,\vec{w}_n &lt;/math&gt; are (perhaps not distinct) elements of a vector space &lt;math&gt; W &lt;/math&gt; then there exists a homomorphism from &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; W &lt;/math&gt; sending &lt;math&gt; \vec{\beta}_1 &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \vec{w}_1 &lt;/math&gt;, ..., and &lt;math&gt; \vec{\beta}_n &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \vec{w}_n &lt;/math&gt;, and that homomorphism is unique.

I'd formulate it as:

;Theorem 1.9
A homomorphism &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is determined by its action on a basis. That is, if &lt;math&gt; \langle \vec{\beta}_1,\dots,\vec{\beta}_n \rangle  &lt;/math&gt;  is a basis of a vector space &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \vec{w}_1,\dots,\vec{w}_n &lt;/math&gt; are the images of the base, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\vec{w}_i= h(\vec{\beta}_i)&lt;/math&gt;, then the image of any &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}\in V &lt;/math&gt; , with:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{v}= \sum_i \lambda_i \vec{\beta}_i&lt;/math&gt;

is uniqely determined by:

:&lt;math&gt;h(\vec{v})= h(\sum_i \lambda_i \vec{\beta}_i)=\sum_i \lambda_i h(\vec{\beta}_i)=\sum_i \lambda_i \vec{w}_i&lt;/math&gt;

This may be read as: ''the image of a certain linear combination of the vectors of a base, is the same combination of the images of these vectors.''

[[File:Drying shrimp paste.jpg|thumb|right|Shrimp paste being dried under the sun in Hong Kong]]

'''Shrimp paste''' is a common ingredient used in Southeast Asian and Southern Chinese cuisine. It is known as '''terasi''' (also spelled ''trassi'', ''terasie'') in Indonesian.

It is made from fermented ground shrimp, sun dried and then cut into fist-sized rectangular blocks. It is not designed, nor customarily used for immediate consumption and has to be fully cooked prior to consumption since it is raw. To many unfamiliar with this condiment, the strong smell can be considered unappetizing; however, it is an essential ingredient in many curries and sauces. It is often an ingredient in dipping sauce for fish or vegetables.

==Availability==
[[Image:Trassie oedang.jpg|thumb|Trassi udang, as bought in a Dutch supermarket]]
Shrimp paste can be found in nations outside Southeast Asia in markets catering to Asian customers.  In The Netherlands, Indonesian type of shrimp paste can be found in supermarket selling Asian foodstuff such as Trassie Oedang brand. In the United States brands of Thai shrimp paste such as Pantainorasingh and Tra Chang can be found.  Shrimp pastes from other countries are also available in Asian supermarkets and through mail order. In Australia shrimp paste can be found in suburbs where most South East Asian people resides. In Europe it can be bought in the supermarket.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Being clear about why you have established the business will enable you to keep perspective as the business grows and develops and you are faced with the challenges of a growing business.


Every day in the business, there will be decisions to make about how to do business. It will be helpful to have clarity over what is most important to you about how you run your business and what your bottom lines are to ensure you continuously make decisions in line with what is important to you.

Rank the following values from 1 to 9 with 1 being the most important value to you: 

Making a living for myself and/or my family

Being the best and most well known at my business

Contributing toward a healthy, sustainable planet for future generations to inherit

Being a contribution to other people – both in my local community and elsewhere

Being a good employer – being committed to employees satisfaction, development and wellbeing and treating everyone fairly

Encouraging others to treat the environment and people with respect

Having a good balance between how much time I spend working vs other things that are important to me (family, hobbies etc)

Treating everyone I interact with fairly

All my decisions are honest and ethical

And to support me in operating this way, how do I ensure that those I work with know what is important to me and are able to integrate it into the way they do business?

      <text xml:space="preserve">You may have to work with your eXist system administrator to first enable the XSL-FO XQuery module in order for these examples to run.  This can be done by using the following steps.

== Step 1: Enable the XSLFO XQuery Module ==
Edit the conf.xml file in the $EXIST_HOME directory.  You must un-comment the xslfo module.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;module class=&quot;org.exist.xquery.modules.xslfo.XSLFOModule&quot; uri=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/xslfo&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Step 2: Edit the extensions build.properties file == 

If your eXist was not built from source the fo module and supporting fop.jar file must also be included in your exist-modules.jar file in all production systems.  This can be done by downloading the eXist source and changing the build.properties file setting to be true.  For details please see the [http://exist.sourceforge.net/building.html eXist build instructions]

$EXIST_HOME lib/extensions/build.properties
or
$EXIST_HOME extensions/build.properties
&lt;pre&gt;
# XSL FO transformations (Uses Apache FOP)
include.module.xslfo = true
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you are running release 1.4 of eXist, the Apache FOP version referenced might no longer be available. If you have a line like the following in your build-properties like this:

== Step 3: Update the path to the new XSL-FO zip file in the configuration file ==

&lt;pre&gt;
include.module.xslfo.url = http://apache.cs.uu.nl/dist/xmlgraphics/fop/binaries/fop-0.95-bin.zip
&lt;/pre&gt;

You will find that the Apache project removed the old binaries (not always best practice).

This is the new line this should be replaced with.

&lt;pre&gt;
include.module.xslfo.url = http://apache.cs.uu.nl/dist/xmlgraphics/fop/binaries/fop-1.0-bin.zip
&lt;/pre&gt;

And additionally change references to the deprecated version in $EXIST_HOME extensions/modules/build.xml to point to the newer version. E.g:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;!-- Apache FOP --&gt;
		&lt;get src=&quot;${include.module.xslfo.url}&quot; dest=&quot;fop-1.0-bin.zip&quot; verbose=&quot;true&quot; usetimestamp=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;unzip src=&quot;fop-1.0-bin.zip&quot; dest=&quot;${top.dir}/${lib.user}&quot;&gt;
			&lt;patternset&gt;
				&lt;include name=&quot;fop-1.0/build/fop.jar&quot;/&gt;
				&lt;include name=&quot;fop-1.0/lib/batik-all-*.jar&quot;/&gt;
				&lt;include name=&quot;fop-1.0/lib/xmlgraphics-commons-*.jar&quot;/&gt;
				&lt;include name=&quot;fop-1.0/lib/avalon-*.jar&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;/patternset&gt;
			&lt;mapper type=&quot;flatten&quot;/&gt;
		&lt;/unzip&gt;
		&lt;delete file=&quot;fop-1.0-bin.zip&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Step 4 Download the new XSLFO Zip file ==

When you run a build the next time this will download the Apache FOP jar file from the Apache web site.

   cd $EXIST_HOME/extensions/modules
   ant -version
   ant prepare-libs-xslfo

Sample from build log:
&lt;pre&gt;
prepare-libs-xslfo:
     [echo] Load: true
     [echo] ------------------------------------------------------
     [echo] Downloading libraries required by the xsl-fo module
     [echo] ------------------------------------------------------
      [get] Getting: http://apache.cs.uu.nl/dist/xmlgraphics/fop/binaries/fop-1.0-bin.zip
      [get] To: C:\ws\eXist-1.4dev\extensions\modules\fop-1.0-bin.zip
      [get] ....................................................

      [get] last modified = Thu Jul 31 09:47:44 CDT 2008
    [unzip] Expanding: C:\workspace\exist\extensions\modules\fop-1.0-bin.zip in to C:\workspace\exist\lib\user
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Step 5 Verify that the new XSLFO Library is available ==
Note that in addition to the fop binary the following jar file is required by the FOP processor.

   $EXIST-HOME/lib/user/xmlgraphics-commons-1.3.1.jar

On UNIX:
  $ sudo cp -v xmlgraphics-commons-1.4.jar $EXIST_HOME/lib/user
  `xmlgraphics-commons-1.4.jar' -&gt; `/usr/local/exist/lib/user/xmlgraphics-commons-1.4.jar'

This can be downloaded from [http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/xmlgraphics/commons the Apache XML Graphics Commons Distribution Mirror]

== Step 6 Copy the Java files ==
Copy the jar files from $EXIST-HOME/lib/user/fop.jar and the new $EXIST-HOME/lib/extensions/exist-modules.jar on to your production systems.  Note you should make sure the source and destination systems are the same version.

If you want to have fop hyphenate your text, put the fop-hyphen.jar into $EXIST-HOME/lib/user/ and restart eXist. fo:blocks with the attribute ''hyphenate'' set to ''true'' in you fo or xsl file will be hyphenated then if you add a ''language'' attribute to the fo:page-sequence. The patterns for many languages are available here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/offo/

Note that your exist-modules.jar file can then be placed on the systems that do not have the source code.  There is currently no method to use FOP without downloading the source.  Also note that you can verify that your exist-modules.jar file contains the XSLFO classes by running:

You can now check that the jar files are correctly installed in the user libraries directory:

  $ ls -l $EXIST_HOME/lib/user/*.jar
Which returns

== Build The Extensions ==

Type the following into the shell:
   $ ./build.{sh|bat} extension-modules

If the build fails with
  &quot;$EXIST_HOME/build/classes&quot; does not exist or is not a directory
, it helps to create the classes folder, afterwards build is successful:
  mkdir $EXIST_HOME/build/classes

== Verify that the jar files are in the right position ==
   $ jar tf exist-extensions.jar

Or on a windows system you can change the jar file file name to end with .zip, uncompress and check that the xslfo classes are in the exist-modules file.

Let &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; be a function on &lt;math&gt;[0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;. The '''Laplace transform''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the integral

:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = \mathcal{L}\{f\}(s) = \int_0^{\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The domain of &lt;math&gt;F(s)&lt;/math&gt; is all values of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; such that the integral exists.

== Existence ==


== Properties ==
=== Linearity ===
Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; be functions whose Laplace transforms exist for &lt;math&gt;s &gt; \alpha&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; be constants. Then, for &lt;math&gt;s &gt; \alpha&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\{af + bg\} = a \mathcal{L}\{f\} + b \mathcal{L}\{g\}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

which can be proved using the properties of improper integrals.

=== Shifting in ''s'' ===
If the Laplace transform &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\{f\}(s) = F(s)&lt;/math&gt; exists for &lt;math&gt;s &gt; \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\{e^{at} f(t)\}(s) = F(s - a)\,&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;s &gt; \alpha + a&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof.'''

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}\{e^{at} f(t)\}(s) &amp;{} = \int_0^{\infty} e^{-st} e^{at} f(t) dt \\
&amp;{} = \int_0^{\infty} e^{-(s-a)t} f(t) dt \\
&amp;{} = F(s - a)\,.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The technical side manages all technical aspects of a society. Groups of technical experts mange areas which they have the technical expertise to manage. Management revolves around projects composed of multi-discipline teams working locally as possible. The terms ''technate'' then refers to the overall geographical area where the managers operate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Holons and a Holonic Society ===

==== Holons ====

The concept of a holon forms one of the central ideas proposed for forming a technate/proto-technate. The word &quot;holon’’ comes from the Greek &quot;holos,'' meaning 'whole', and &quot;-on,'' meaning 'part'.  The word aptly captures the duality of entities which we can view as a single, distinct en­tities, and at the same time parts of a more comprehensive whole.   For exam­ple, a cell in your body falls under the holon category. Cell exists as a distinct, living entity; it has inputs, out­puts, and a distinct cell wall defining its interface with the rest of the world. A cell, however, consists of smaller and more fundamental parts, such as RNA, DNA, mitochondria etc. Each component can be studied as a separate entity; however, each component can be broken down further - into molecules, atoms, and ultimately to quarks. This decomposition of cells is characteristic for a holonic organisation.

We can also go the other way, and see that cells group togeth­er with other cells to become organs.  Organs, in turn, form parts of the human body.  Here, we see that holonic organisation also supports composition as well.

In addition to the part-whole characteristic, holons have a number of other characteristics:

* Each holon functions autonomously. It means that each holon carries out its own activities without the direction of oth­er holons; yet, it still forms a part of, and contributes to, the overall functioning of a larger system.

* Holons naturally form distributed systems. This comes on from the autonomous attribute.

* Each holon has a simple, singular task to perform and con­centrates exclusively on that task.  The system accomplishes larger  scale  tasks  through  the  combination of a number of holons, either through combining them together to form a large­er  holon,  or  through  cooperation  or  competition  between holons.

* Although holons function autonomously, their interaction with other holons may yield complex flows of information in order to achieve each interacting holon’s goals. Therefore, a holon must process and respond to in-bound data from exter­nal sources, as well as provide other holons with requested information.

* As holons interact, the sum of their actions could become greater than the action of the individual holon.  Some exam­ples could include ant hills, where a number of ants cooperate to construct a mound, yet no single ant would have the capa­bility to achieve the construction individually.  The construction of cities forms another example. The shapes of many of the world's cities were not the result of centralised plan­ning.  Nonetheless, the organisation and interaction of a num­ber of people and organisations has resulted in some of the most spectacular cities on Earth, such as San  Francisco,  New York, Rome, and others.

==== The Advantages of Holonic Systems ====

Holons are particularly well suited for complex and/or dis­tributed systems. Some reasons follow:

* Scalability  As each holon has the property of being au­tonomous, it can function with little or no knowledge of other holons.  Thus, we can add additional holons to the system, de­pending on the system in question, without affecting the oper­ation of the previously existing holons.  As additional holons are contributed to the system, a coherent organisation will tend to form naturally, such as a hierarchy where higher-lev­el, more abstract holons manage lower-level, more detail-ori­ented holons.  Consider, as another example, any plant or ani­mal, which starts as one cell, but which divides and grows to many cells, forming organs along the way.

* Robustness  Robustness also results from the autonomous na­ture of a holon.  Just as we can add holons, we can also re­move them without, in general, affecting the functioning of other holons or the system as a whole. For example: human body can lose many cells without even noticing it. It can even survive the loss of a substantial por­tion of the body, such as a limb.

* Simplicity of control As each holon has a simple, usually singular, task to accomplish, it only needs a simple control mechanism, which can be understood more easily when compared to a centralised control system.

==== Disadvantages of Holonic System ====

Distributed and autonomous holons, for all their advantages, also have some disadvantages compared to centralised mechanisms.

* Tragedy of the commons  The autonomous attribute can lead holons to consume shared resources without consideration for others, and end up taking more than their fair share.  This could limit the ability of other holons to work, and may even bring an end to the common resources. Example: a farmer allowing his cow to eat all the common grass, preventing other farmers from grazing their cattle.

* Losing their way  We can see another problem with the autonomous attribute. Autonomous holons could conduct activi­ties that do not contribute to the overall goal of the system. They could even conduct activities that are contrary to the overall goal.  Cancer cells would form an example of holons that have gone out of control and became a danger to the sys­tem as a whole.

The root cause of the first deficiency we can usually at­tribute to a lack of negative feedback in the holon’s opera­tion.   For example, if the farmer knew a priori of the impact the cow would have on the field, and therefore other farmers, he would take steps to alleviate the problem before it got out of hand. The farmer would need a bigger picture to achieve this in­sight. However, this leads to one possible solution, where a higher-level holon could administer lower-level holons. Not an ideal situation. It is pre­ferred that the other farmers communicate with the offending farmer, so that issues are resolved locally and quickly.

We may, however, have difficulty understanding the cause for the latter deficiency, since there is a number of issues to consider. For in­stance, simple miscommunication or misunderstanding may result in an erroneous interpretation of the holon's goal. Indeed, scientists have traced most causes of genetic defects that, in a sense, we can consider as miscommunication in genetic programming of the cell.  We could see another cause as the autonomous nature of the holon, which could deliberately decide to change its own goals.  The &quot;bait-and-switch’’ manoeuvre that con-artists and other petty criminals use exemplify this.

==== A Holonic Structure for a Future Society ====

A holonic structure represents a potentially vi­able form for future society.

As a means of allowing this organisation, EOS propose the fol­lowing holoarchy:

* 1. Individuals
* 2. Groups
* 3. Zones
* 4. Areas
* 5. Sectors
* 6. Technate

Individuals form the basic building blocks of societies, and each individual has goals and objectives as well as skills and interests.  Any social structure should take this into account. The author hopes that the holonic structure would allow people to utilise their interests and skills to achieve their own desires in such a way as to con­tribute to the whole structure.

To achieve this, individuals form interest groups, such as research, medical, and food production. Individuals who have skills and interests in common with a specific group could choose to join that group. However, not all groups would have specialised interests; some groups would have a more mixed membership.  This would depend on the size of the group and the number of members (e.g., in the case of members of NET residing in a single town).

Groups maintain goals and monitor projects. The goals of any group should be compatible with the overall goals of the technocracy. Likewise, the projects within the group should contribute, in some way, to the group and thus to the imple­mentation of technocracy.

Some projects, of course, may turn out to be too large for a single group to undertake (e.g., repairing the Golden Gate bridge or the construction of an airplane).  To deal with this, groups can form areas, where areas act in sim­ilar ways to groups.  Instead of being composed of individu­als, however, areas are comprised of groups (think of a consortium or standards organisation, like OSI, OMG, and ANSI). Areas cooperate with each other to fulfil the goals defined for each area. Those goals, like the goals of groups, are compatibile with the goals of technocracy.  And, of course, the projects run within areas will have similarity to the projects of groups in that they would also contribute to the goals of technocracy but on a larger scale.

Again, like areas, sectors form the next level up in the holoarchy and run larger projects. Areas compose sectors.

The technate forms the final layer of the holoarchy.  This layer runs large scale projects over the whole operational area of the technate and has goals in accordance with technocracy's goals.

Thus, the whole system becomes a gestalt - one composed of individual, goal orientated parts that use projects to achieve their goals.  As each part lines up with other parts in the holoarchy, through cooperation, the system achieves the over­all goals of the technate.


==== Control and Direction in the Holoarchy ====

As each group, area, or sector can act autonomously, the sys­tem has the potential to develop some problems, as noted above.  Some of the holons could end up repeating work that other holons have conducted and other holons could conduct work that does not contribute to the whole.

To prevent such problems, we propose a hierarchical structure that lays on top of the holoarchy. This overlapping structure would have the following goals:

* 1. Maintain direction of the system

* 2. Act as a communications channel to facilitate cooperation between holons

* 3. Ensure efficient utilisation of resources, thus preventing unnecessary repetition of work

The proposed structure EOS refers to as a sequence structure with a board at the top which acts to direct the whole system.  A number of functional sequences would then form under the board, with the director of each se­quence being represented on the board. For example, the structure could have functional sequences for health, research, manufacturing, mining, recycling, energy, transporta­tion and space.

Each sequence would have a sub-sequence for each sector.  So, for example, the Sequence of Research would have a number of Sector Sequences of Research below it.  Each sector sequence would then have area sub-sequences below it, and the area se­quences would have group sub-sequences below it.   Each sequence at each level would have a director.  For example, the Sequences of Research would have a Director of the Sequence of Research and the various sector research sequences would have various Directors of Sector Sequences of Research and so on for areas and groups.  We can see this as being analogous to a commercial company in present-day economic systems, where you have a Chief Technology Officer, Director of Research, with indi­vidual project directors below them.

This means that an individual would have membership both in a group and a sequence and, hopefully, will actively participate in a project.
Roles of Directors

Directors of each sequence have overall responsibility of ensuring that each holon contributes to the overall goal of technocracy.  Thus, the directors at each level have to approve each project, and can cancel a project if that project has wandered away from the goals of technocracy.  The director can also cancel a project if it is in conflict with another project; for example, if two holons attempted to do the same pro­ject.  However, once a project has started, and so long as it remains compatible with the goals of technocracy, the director has no control over the project in keeping with the autonomous nature of the holon.

Each project would have a project manager. The project manager has the administrative responsibility of running the project, including the allocation of resources, time schedule, etc. The manager runs the project without any inter­ference of the directors as long as the project remains within the goals.

For projects that involve cooperation or coordination between a number of holons, the holon director has the responsibility of ensuring communication with other holons. For example, within an area the Area Director must ensure that all holons have adequate communications in order to allow them to conduct their projects.  Thus, the sequences act as a communications channel for each holon.

==== Goals ====

Goals become the most import attribute of the above structure. Goals give direction and purpose to the system as a whole.

Technocrats have the following top level goal:

''The highest standard of living for the longest time possi­ble.''

To achieve this goal, sequences and holons may have other goals, but those other goals must contribute to the overall goal.  For example, the Sequence of Research could have the goal of conducting an energy survey and may run one or more project to achieve that goal.  However, the goal of the energy survey also contributes to the overall goal of technocracy in that it determines the kind and quantity of resources available and the energy re­quired to build a sustainable society that has a high standard of living.

Optical telescopes increase the apparent brightness and magnification of an object. Infrared telescopes look for heat signatures. There are also huge radio telescope dishes, as well as ultraviolet and x-ray telescopes that have been launched into orbit.

There are two main types of optical telescope - reflectors and refractors. Reflectors use a mirror to collect the light, whilst refractors use a lens. Generally, reflectors are better for deep sky objects whilst refractors are useful for planetary observations. Some telescopes use a combination of lenses and mirrors to use best the advantages of each.

Refractor telescopes require a large lens at the front to direct the incoming light to the lens. This lens can be made of more than one piece, and the differing refractive properties of the components serve to reduce aberration at the edge of the image. The lenses can also be coated to reduce internal reflections.

'''Catadioptrics''' are short, wide telescopes that use both mirrors and lenses. The price range is between reflectors and refractors.

Large lenses suffer from the disadvantage of sagging under their own weight. This causes the shape to become distorted and so the image will be irregular. For this reason the largest refracting telescope ever built only has a diameter of 41&quot;. All larger telescopes instead use a mirror are the primary collecting surface.

In the optical spectrum, great precision is required in crafting the lenses and mirrors used in a telescope. The standard of precision for a telescope mirror is accuracy to 1/4 the wavelength of light, an exceedingly small quantity. But even greater accuracy is generally preferred, especially for space-based telescopes. Special tools have been developed for measuring the accuracy of a telescope mirror and lens, and the procedure for finishing the surface is very exacting.

== Infrared Telescopes ==
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large, space telescope optimized for viewing in the infrared part of the spectrum, scheduled for launch in 2018. From the NASA website: &quot;JWST will find the first galaxies that formed in the early Universe, connecting the Big Bang to our own Milky Way Galaxy. JWST will peer through dusty clouds to see stars forming planetary systems, connecting the Milky Way to our own Solar System. JWST's instruments will be designed to work primarily in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum, with some capability in the visible range.
 
JWST will have a large mirror, 6.5 meters (21.3 feet) in diameter and a sunshield the size of a tennis court.

JWST will reside in an orbit about 1.5 million km (1 million miles) from the Earth.&quot; http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/

== Ultraviolet Telescopes ==
Ultraviolet astronomy studies light with wavelengths just shorter than visible light.  This wavelength region turns out to be particularly useful for studying atomic emissions from hydrogen and helium, the two most common gases in space (and in the Sun, and stars, and gas giant planets).  
Ultraviolet light does not reach the Earth's surface, so ultraviolet astronomy is done from satellites in space.   Ultraviolet detectors function well on telescopes with conventional optics such as Hubble Space Telescope.   Ultraviolet images from Hubble have dramatically revealed planetary auroras on Jupiter and Saturn from magnetospheric electrons striking atomic and molecular hydrogen in auroral zones at high latitudes on the planets.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Description===

Sometimes it is necessary to open a MessageBox that gives a short Message to the user.
That can be an error message or something like that.

For this purpose, there is ZUNE's '''MUI_Request'''.


===Sourcecode===

This is how it works:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;proto/exec.h&gt;
#include &lt;proto/intuition.h&gt;
#include &lt;proto/muimaster.h&gt;
#include &lt;libraries/mui.h&gt;

int main (int argc, char **argv) {
   struct Library *MUIMasterBase   = NULL;
         
   // open Zune (=MUI) library
   if (MUIMasterBase = (struct Library *) OpenLibrary(&quot;muimaster.library&quot;, 0)) {
            
      // create application and window, the root objects of any Zune application:
      // window need minimum content to open, so we add a TextObject
      Object *window;
      Object *app = ApplicationObject,
         SubWindow, window = WindowObject,
            WindowContents, TextObject,
                MUIA_Text_Contents, &quot;Inside your window.&quot;,
            End,
         End,
      End;
         
      if (app) {
         // open window:
         set(window, MUIA_Window_Open, TRUE);
            
         // test if opening window was successful:
         IPTR open;
         get(window, MUIA_Window_Open, &amp;open);
         
         if (open) {
            // show requester:
            MUI_Request(app, window, 0L, &quot;MessageBox Title&quot;, &quot;Close button text&quot;, &quot;Your Message Text&quot;,

            // close window, and dump objects:
            set(window, MUIA_Window_Open, FALSE);
         }      
                
         MUI_DisposeObject(app);
      } 

      CloseLibrary(MUIMasterBase);
   }
}           
&lt;/source&gt;

''Note: In the above example, to save typing and get a clearer look, some C macros have been used (ApplicationObject, WindowObject, SubWindow, set(), and get()), which are defined in &lt;libraries/mui.h&gt;, see there for more C macros, and what Zune's macros actually do.''

===AROS native compiler command line===

 gcc [sourcefile] -lmui


===Screenshot===

And this is how it looks:

===AROS version===

This example tested with AROS of 2010-03-10.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Although the Greek origin of the word ''telescope'' means ''far-seeing'', &quot;see something far away&quot; is not a good description of the function of a telescope. If an object is bright enough, no matter how far it is, we can see it. In fact, telescopes serve three main functions:
#light collection
#resolution
#magnification
Before understanding how telescopes work to achieve these three goals, we take a pause here and study some principals that the optics work.

== Reflection and Refraction ==
The most primitive type of a telescope is a '''refracting''' telescope (also called a '''refractor'''), which is used by Galileo back in the 1600's. Later, Newton designed and built a '''reflecting''' telescope (also called a '''reflector''') making use of mirrors. We first focus on refracting telescopes. A basic refractor consists of a converging lens which focus light onto the focal plane at which detectors and instruments are then placed. As discussed in the previous chapter, the path a light ray passing through a lens can be understood by the Snell's law of refraction:

&lt;math&gt;n_1 \sin{\theta_1} = n_2 \sin{\theta_2} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

{{TODO|Add basic refractor diagram}}
{{TODO|Add converging lens ray diagram}}

== Magnification ==


== Light Gathering Power ==
Since most objects in the sky are very dim, a telescope effectively collects and converges light for our viewing. How dim are they? A brief calculation helps explain.

The Sun is at a distance of 1 AU (~1.5e+11 m) away, the light coming out &quot;spread&quot; over a spherical surface (actually it is the energy that spreads over a surface, which we call the flux). Suppose we have a telescope with a 2 m (diameter) aperture, then the fraction of light collected from the Sun is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mbox{light collecting area}}{\mbox{area of spherical surface}} = \frac{\pi(1)^2}{4\pi(1.5 \times 10^{11})^2} \simeq 1.1 \times 10^{-23}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

For objects beyond the solar system, they are millions, if not billions, times further away from us. Therefore, astronomers prefer to build larger telescopes for greater light collecting power.

==What is a Zune custom class?==

A Zune custom class is a newly created Zune class based on an existing one. A custom class may provide improvements or changes to the one it's based upon, thus extending Zune. 

Zune custom classes are identified by the suffix &quot;.mcc&quot;.

AROS' Zune classes (including supplied custom classes) are located at SYS:Classes/Zune.



[http://craigsretrocomputingpage.eu5.org/muiclasses/muiclasses.html Mui Custom Classes (MCC)] some of which are closed sources.

==Using custom classes==

Here is an example how a private class is defined:

&lt;pre&gt;
extern struct MUI_CustomClass *FPEditor_CLASS;

/*** Macros *****************************************************************/

#define FPEditorObject BOOPSIOBJMACRO_START(FPEditor_CLASS-&gt;mcc_Class)
&lt;/pre&gt;


Some custom classes are supplied with AROS. Others can be installed into AROS. Others can be loaded from disk.

Custom classes usage in your application is mostly straightforward (just like any built-in class). The only prerequisite might be including the appropriate #include-file.

For example: If you've been using the (built-in) &quot;Text&quot; class/object of Zune...

&lt;pre&gt;
#include &lt;proto/muimaster.h&gt;
#include &lt;libraries/mui.h&gt;
...
   TextObject,
      MUIA_Text_Contents, &quot;hello world&quot;,
...
&lt;/pre&gt;

...you may use the custom class &quot;TextEditor&quot; exactly the same way, just add the proper include-file and adjust the attribute (MUIA_...) to match the new class:

&lt;pre&gt;
#include &lt;proto/muimaster.h&gt;
#include &lt;libraries/mui.h&gt;
#include &lt;mui/TextEditor_mcc.h&gt;
...
   TextEditorObject,
      MUIA_TextEditor_Contents, &quot;hello world&quot;,
...
&lt;/pre&gt;

Another example is the &quot;NListview&quot;/&quot;NList&quot; class, which is an enhanced replacement of the (built-in) &quot;Listview&quot;/&quot;List&quot; class. In this case even the custom classes' attributes match the original classes' ones.

Of course it all depends on the way a custom class is built - it might introduce completely new attributes or method. In any case it is strongly recommended to obtain a custom classes' developer documentation of attributes and methods.



If you have a custom class,and this should have an extra attribute, which needs to trigger via a Notify-method.
You simply need to forward the OM_SET message to your superclass.  

&lt;pre&gt;
struct TagItem *tags, *tag;

for
(
tags = message-&gt;ops_AttrList;
(tag = NextTagItem(&amp;tags));
)
{
switch (tag-&gt;ti_Tag)
{
....
}
}

return DoSuperMethodA(CLASS, self, (Msg)message);
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you want the app to be able to check the attribute via a Notify that is setup at progstart. Than you want to set the attribute inside the class, and the app should react according to that notify. 




==Reference==


===BetterString===



Can scrollback buffers be achieved with betterstring.mcc?
Yes, simply subclass it and add an eventhandler with priority above zero, and react on the arrow up/down keys. 
My idea for an API would be a method a la MUIM_BetterString_Freeze, which would add the contents of the current buffer to the history. Normally one would then setup a notify to let MUIA_String_Acknowledge trigger this method.
Additionally there should be a tag to force moving to a certain buffer.

If you do create a buffer-system, please let the Freeze-method verify that the buffer has changed, and only add it if so - there's nothing as irritating as the unix shell which keeps adding repeated commands to the history, so that one has to press arrow-up a zillion times before getting to the previous *different* command... 




===NList===

It is more powerful, as it supports horizontal scroll, clickable titles, re-arranging of columns, re-layout of columns etc. - but most consider it more complex and not as fast plus it has a few flaws. 

creating your list like so 

 MUIA_NList_Format, &quot;BAR,BAR,BAR,&quot;,

That will give you a four column list, each column separated by a vertical bar. Add or remove 'BAR,' entries to the desired number of columns. If you have enabled the titles (a good idea for multi-column lists) then you should also ensure that your display hook sets the titles for each column. 


For sorting you must supply MUIA_NList_CompareHook (or overload MUIM_NList_Compare) to get proper comparison. The default comparison method works only for single column lists with plain string pointers.


How to tell if a certain entry is in the visible part of the NList then? 
You can calculate the visible entries using: MUIA_NList_Horiz_DeltaFactor, MUIA_NList_Horiz_First &amp;
MUIA_NList_Horiz_Visible. 


If you are using custom data structures: 
*Display method/hook is required.
*Compare method/hook is required if you are using sorting.
*Construct/Destruct is optional, to temporary copy these structures or whatever you want. 

If Construct/Destruct are missing NList.mcc will pass entry which you inserted directly to f.e. Display/Compare/Destruct. 


Procedure with variable amount of parameters in aros, and some damn macro... here is a valid and working procedures, resolves some problems with &quot;End&quot; macro, and implementation of DoSuperNew 

&lt;pre&gt;
IPTR NewObjectAROS( struct IClass *classPtr, STRPTR classID, ULONG tag1, ... )
{
AROS_SLOWSTACKTAGS_PRE(tag1)
retval = (IPTR) NewObject(classPtr, classID, AROS_SLOWSTACKTAGS_ARG(tag1));
AROS_SLOWSTACKTAGS_POST
}

IPTR DoSuperNew(struct IClass *cl, Object *obj, ULONG tag1, ...)
{
AROS_SLOWSTACKTAGS_PRE(tag1)
retval = (IPTR)DoSuperMethod(cl, obj, OM_NEW, AROS_SLOWSTACKTAGS_ARG(tag1));
AROS_SLOWSTACKTAGS_POST
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
IPTR DoSuperNew(Class *cl, Object *obj, Tag tag1, ...)
{
  AROS_SLOWSTACKTAGS_PRE(tag1)
  
  retval = DoSuperNewTagList(cl, obj, NULL, AROS_SLOWSTACKTAGS_ARG(tag1));

  AROS_SLOWSTACKTAGS_POST
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

or in a more portable manner 

&lt;pre&gt;
Object *DoSuperNew(struct IClass *cl, Object *obj, ...)
{
    Object *rc;
    va_list args;

    va_start(args, obj);

    rc = (Object *)DoSuperMethod(cl, obj, OM_NEW, va_arg(args, IPTR), NULL);

    va_end(args);

    return rc;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
DMethod(my_listview, MUIM_NList_ReplaceSingle, &quot;foo&quot;, MUIV_NList_Insert_Active, NOWRAP, ALIGN_LEFT); 
DoMethod(my_listview, MUIM_NList_Redraw, MUIV_NList_Redraw_Active);
&lt;/pre&gt;


I intentionally ignore __stackparm in the prototype because it has no meaning for PPC and x86-64 at the moment, and it never had it for i386 and m68k. When  the  preprocessor expands macros on i386 (or any other architecture
which puts all arguments on stack). the code is turned into this: 

&lt;pre&gt;
IPTR DoSuperNew(Class *cl, Object *obj, Tag tag1, ...)
{
  IPTR retval;
  
  retval = DoSuperNewTagList(cl, obj, NULL, &amp;tag1);

  return retval;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you declare the function static, gcc's extremely-clever-award-winning-supper-dupper-mega-ultra-optimizer
looks at this and decides that the function uses only its first tag1 argument. And calls like: 

  DoSuperNew(cl,  o,  MUIA_Foo, MUIV_Foo, MUIA_Bar, MUIV_Bar, TAG_MORE, morecoolstuff)

are turned into: DoSuperNew(cl,  o,  MUIA_Foo)

Which in fact cause undefined behavior. In most cases FindTagItem() browses  stack  contents  until  it  hits  zero longword occasionally appeared  somewhere,  so you notice almost nothing. In some cases this can cause memory trashing and illegal address accesses. 

Perhaps  a  more future-proof solution would be to use va_start() and va_end()  macros.  On  architectures we talk about va_list is simply a pointer  to  current  argument  (i. e. in our example it will be &amp;tag1 right after va_start()). 

&lt;pre&gt;
IPTR DoSuperNew(Class *cl, Object *obj, Tag tag1, ...)
{
  IPTR retval;
  va_list args;
  va_start(args, tag1);
  
  retval = DoSuperNewTagList(cl, obj, NULL, args);

  va_end(args);
  return retval;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

NList.mcc

This MCC public custom class is very similar to the MUI's list class. It handles directly most attributes which are handled by Listview in the original couple List/Listview. The NListview exist anyway to provide a complete object with scrollbars, so you should use it as child of NListview. Anyway, you can use NList without NListview if you don't want any builtin scrollbar. 

NOTE: NList class will not work with Listview without some conflicts, and NListview class can't use List as child but only NList or a NList subclass.

MUIM_NList_TestPos and MUIM_List_TestPos are similar but use a different struct to store data.
MUIM_List_TestPos works like with a List object.

NOTE: Avoid as possible to do many things in MUIM_Show and MUIM_Hide methods because when an object is in a virtual group, your object will receive them for each one of its moves !!!

Standard tags with NList special values :

MUIA_Background   has the same meaning than MUIA_NList_ListBackground but only at init.

MUIA_Font         is settable only at init. MUIV_NList_Font, MUIV_NList_Font_Little
                  and MUIV_NList_Font_Fixed are special values usable for it (settable in prefs)
                  but standard values are usable too.

MUIA_Frame        you can override the defaults frames of the classe by setting it, but it will
                  be overrided again by defaults if a set(obj,MUIA_NList_Input,bool) is made after.
                  if MUIA_NList_Input is TRUE then the default is MUIV_Frame_InputList, if FALSE
                  it's MUIV_Frame_ReadList.

MUIA_NList_Active -- [ISGN], LONG

        MUIV_NList_Active_Off
        MUIV_NList_Active_Top
        MUIV_NList_Active_Bottom
        MUIV_NList_Active_Up
        MUIV_NList_Active_Down
        MUIV_NList_Active_PageUp
        MUIV_NList_Active_PageDown


MUIA_NList_ActiveObjectOnClick -- [ISG], BOOL

    Default FALSE. If set to TRUE, the NList object will become the MUIA_Window_ActiveObject 
    of its window when you click on it. In addition, the active selected entries 
    will switch an inactive color (e.g. grey) in case the NList object isn't currently active. 
    As soon as the object is active it will then also receive all user keys pressed. 


MUIA_NList_AdjustHeight -- [I..], BOOL

    Same function as List.mui/MUIA_List_AdjustHeight.

        Will adjust the nlist height if the nlist object is in a virtual
        group or if MUIA_NList_SourceInsert, MUIA_NList_SourceString,
        MUIA_NList_SourceArray or MUIA_List_SourceArray was used.

        When the object is in a virtual group, a re-layout of this one
        will be forced when the entries number of the NList object change,
        so all entries should always be visible.

    DEFAULT
        FALSE



MUIA_NList_AdjustWidth -- [I..], BOOL

    FUNCTION
        Same function as List.mui/MUIA_List_AdjustWidth.

        Will adjust the nlist width if the nlist object is in a virtual
        group or if MUIA_NList_SourceInsert, MUIA_NList_SourceString,
        MUIA_NList_SourceArray or MUIA_List_SourceArray was used.

    DEFAULT
        FALSE



NList.mcc/MUIA_NList_AutoClip

    NAME
        MUIA_NList_AutoClip -- [ISG], BOOL

    FUNCTION
        If set to TRUE and the NList object is in read-only (NoInput) mode and
        is set to select char-wide rather than by line, the selected content is
        immediately copied to the clipboard as soon as it is selected via the
        mouse.


MUIA_NList_AutoCopyToClip -- [IS.], BOOL

    FUNCTION
        If set to TRUE you can copy the selected area to the
        clipboard 0 with Amiga-C and Amiga-X (Amiga-X because
        i have seen that sometimes Amiga-C is a shortcut !).
        (works with both Right-Amiga and Left-Amiga keys)

        MUIA_NList_AutoCopyToClip == TRUE also requires that the NList object
        is either the window's active object (see MUIA_Window_ActiveObject) or
        the attached list object is window's default object (see
        MUIA_Window_DefaultObject). Otherwise nothing will ever be copied!



MUIA_NList_AutoVisible -- [ISG], BOOL

    FUNCTION
        Same function as List.mui/MUIA_List_AutoVisible.

        Seting this to TRUE, the NList object will automatically and
        always jump to show the active entry.

    DEFAULT
        FALSE



MUIA_NList_ButtonClick -- [..GN], LONG

    FUNCTION
        You'll get a notify on it each time the user
        clicks one of the buttons made by ESC O[...@&lt;n&gt;] or ESC o[...@&lt;n&gt;].

        The returned value is the &lt;n&gt; of the clicked image/object.
        (see MUIA_NList_DisplayHook for more).

        If you get that value later, it will still be &lt;n&gt; of the latest
        image/object clicked that you'll get.




MUIA_NList_ClickColumn -- [..G], LONG

    FUNCTION
        Same function as Listview.mui/MUIA_Listview_ClickColumn.



MUIA_NList_Columns -- [ISGN], BYTE *

    FUNCTION
        With this tag you can set/get the visible order of columns (as if changed
        by the user). It work for all columns in one time (use MUIM_NList_SetColumnCol
        if you want to exchange 2 columns).

        The value is a pointer on an BYTE array, each byte is for a column
        (in the visible order) and have the value of the display hook col
        which have to be displayed in it.

        The array must be ended with a -1 value.



MUIA_NList_CompareHook -- [IS.], struct Hook *

    FUNCTION
        Same function as List.mui/MUIA_List_CompareHook.



MUIA_NList_CompareHook2 -- [IS.], struct Hook *

    FUNCTION
        Same function as MUIA_NList_CompareHook but A2 will be the object
        and A1 a NList_CompareMessage struct pointer.



MUIA_NList_ConstructHook -- [IS.], struct Hook *

    FUNCTION
        Same function as List.mui/MUIA_List_ConstructHook.

        Think to finish lines entries on a \0 , \n and \r.
        The list will not display anything which come after
        a \n , \r or \0, so finish lines entries on a \0, \r
        and \n if you dont want to waste memory.

    SPECIAL INPUTS
        MUIV_NList_ConstructHook_String

        It's a builtin hook that copy a string entry.
        (so original string can be trash after)
        you must set MUIV_NList_DestructHook_String
        too if you use it.



MUIA_NList_ConstructHook2 -- [IS.], struct Hook *

    FUNCTION
        Same function as MUIA_NList_ConstructHook but A2 will be the object
        and A1 a NList_ConstructMessage struct pointer.



MUIA_NList_CopyColumnToClipHook -- [IS.], struct Hook *

    FUNCTION
        This hook will be called while a MUIM_NList_CopyToClip
        for each column string. You'll certainly get in entry
        a string given by your own MUIA_NList_DisplayHook/2, so
        you must not use the same buffer for both !

        You'll get the entry num in -1 element of the given array,
        elements 1 and 2 are the positions of the first selected
        char and the last+1.

        You must return the pointer of the string to copy to
        clipboard in element 0, a the string length in element 1.

        The builtin hook skip all ESC chars plus their next char
        (and [...] for ESC-P, ESC-I, ESC-O and ESC-o), and add a
        tab char between columns.



MUIA_NList_CopyColumnToClipHook2 -- [IS.], struct Hook *

    FUNCTION
        Same function as MUIA_NList_CopyColumnToClipHook but A2 will be the object
        and A1 a NList_CopyColumnToClipMessage struct pointer.



MUIA_NList_CopyEntryToClipHook -- [IS.], struct Hook *

    FUNCTION
        This work near like MUIA_NList_DisplayHook, execpt
        that it is not called when the NList object want to
        display its lines but when it want to copy them
        to clipboard (or other). See MUIM_NList_CopyToClip.

        You can return only one string pointer (only one
        column for copy), as element 0 of the array.

        The -1 element is the entry number only when
        you don't give a entry pointer to NList_CopyToClip method,
        else it's -1.

        Elements 1,2,3 and 4 of the given array are first column/pos
        and last column/pos which are selected.
        Elements 5 and 6 are 2, 1 or 0 when the 1th and 3rd pos are
        in the format preparse string, the special entry preparse string
        or in the normal string for that entry/columns.

        For column, -1 is the first and -2 the last, else it's its number.
        This is the number of displayed columns and not the corresponding
        entry in the array return by DisplayHook. Anyway, positions are
        calculated from strings returned by DisplayHook.

        For pos, -1 is left of column and -2 its end. The last pos should
        not be included.

        You should use MUIA_NList_CopyColumnToClipHook unless you don't
        want to be copied what is seen in the list.



MUIA_NList_CopyEntryToClipHook2 -- [IS.], struct Hook *

    FUNCTION
        Same function as MUIA_NList_CopyEntryToClipHook but A2 will be the object
        and A1 a NList_CopyEntryToClipMessage struct pointer.



MUIA_NList_DefaultObjectOnClick -- [ISG], BOOL

    FUNCTION
        If set to TRUE, the NList object will become the
        MUIA_Window_DefaultObject of its window when you
        click on it, so the user will be able to control
        the list with keys. The MUIA_Window_ActiveObject
        will be set to None, unless the current active
        object is the NList one itself or if it's the
        MUIA_NList_KeepActive one.

        There is a special meaning if you use both
        DefaultObjectOnClick and MUIA_NList_MakeActive.
        (see MUIA_NList_MakeActive)

    DEFAULT
        TRUE



MUIA_NList_DefClickColumn -- [ISG], LONG

    FUNCTION
        Same function as Listview.mui/MUIA_Listview_DefClickColumn.



MUIA_NList_DestructHook -- [IS.], struct Hook *

    FUNCTION
        Same function as List.mui/MUIA_List_DestructHook.

    SPECIAL INPUTS
        MUIV_NList_DestructHook_String

        It's a builtin hook that free the string entry
        previously allocated and copied by
        the MUIV_NList_ConstructHook_String builtin hook.



MUIA_NList_DestructHook2 -- [IS.], struct Hook *

    FUNCTION
        Same function as MUIA_NList_DestructHook but A2 will be the object
        and A1 a NList_DestructMessage struct pointer.



MUIA_NList_DisplayHook -- [IS.], struct Hook *

    FUNCTION
        Same function as List.mui/MUIA_List_DisplayHook.

        Do not modify the buffers you return in the hook anywhere
        else than in the hook when called by NList.
        (if you do so you MUST set MUIA_NList_DisplayRecall)


        You should return the same thing if its called another
        time with the same inputs !
        The hook will be called with a pointer to the
        entry to be displayed in A1 and a pointer to
        a string array containing as many entries as
        your list may have cols in A2.
        You must fill this array with the strings that
        you want to display.
        The array is DISPLAY_ARRAY_MAX*2 large.
        In the DISPLAY_ARRAY_MAX+col element you can set a
        preparse string for the corresponding col element.
        Using it you'll be able to avoid copying the string in
        a buffer to add something in the beginning of the col
        string.

        The display hook also gets the position of the current entry
        as additional parameter. It is stored in the longword
        preceding the col array (don't forget it's a LONG).
        (setting that LONG value to -2 is another way to tell the object
        to not consider the return string pointeur as valid next time
        he will want to use it, and he will recall the hook).

        When the hook function will be called to get the title strings,
        you'll get NULL in A1, and -1 as position of current entry.


        The hook function will be called each time a line (or a part of
        it) need to be drawn (and when NList need to compute lenght of
        columns contents).


        Here are the escape sequence known by the parsing of NList :
              (If you use C, ESC b can be written &quot;\033b&quot;)

        \t          Tabulation. Go to the next tab boundary of the col.
                    tab positions are separated by 8 spaces by default.
        ESC -       Disable text engine, following chars will be printed
                    without further parsing.
        ESC u       Set the soft style to underline.
        ESC b       Set the soft style to bold.
        ESC i       Set the soft style to italic.
        ESC n       Set the soft style back to normal.
        ESC &lt;n&gt;     Use pen number n (2..9) as front pen. n must be a valid
                    DrawInfo pen as specified in &quot;intuition/screens.h&quot;.
        ESC c       Center current line. only valid at the beginning.
        ESC r       Right justify current line. only valid at the beginning.
        ESC l       Left justify current line. only valid at the beginning.

        These ones are new or modified :

        ESC j       Justify left and right current line. only at beginning.
        ESC I[&lt;s&gt;]  Draw MUI image with specification &lt;s&gt;.
                    See Image.mui/MUIA_Image_Spec for image spec definition.
        ESC O[&lt;p&gt;]                     (ESC O[&lt;s&gt;|&lt;width&gt;|&lt;height&gt;,&lt;minwidth&gt;])
                    Draw the MUIM_NList_CreateImage at adress &lt;p&gt;.
                    (&lt;p&gt; should be an 8 hex digits number).
        ESC o[&lt;n&gt;]                     (ESC o[&lt;s&gt;|&lt;width&gt;|&lt;height&gt;,&lt;minwidth&gt;])
                    Draw the MUIM_NList_UseImage number &lt;n&gt;. If the &lt;n&gt; UseImage
                    don't exist or has been set to NULL, no image is drawn.
        ESC P[]     Use default front pen.
        ESC P[&lt;n&gt;]  Use pen number &lt;n&gt;. (it's a direct pen number, so you must
                    make MUI_ObtainPen and MUI_ReleasePen for it yourself,
                    best to do it is in Setup() and Cleanup() of a subclass).
        ESC T       Draw horizontal line on top of the entry for the col.
        ESC C       Draw horizontal line centered in the entry for the col.
        ESC B       Draw horizontal line on bottom of the entry for the col.
        ESC E       Draw horizontal line centered in the entry for the col,
                    but only on the left and right of the line contents.
        ESC t , ESC t[&lt;n&gt;] , ESC t[M&lt;n&gt;] , ESC t[I&lt;n&gt;]
                    Make the ESC C and ESC E horizontal line become thick and filled
                    with some color :
                    default is MPEN_FILL.
                    [&lt;n&gt;]  means than &lt;n&gt; is a direct pen color, like for ESC P[&lt;n&gt;]
                    [M&lt;n&gt;] means that &lt;n&gt; is MUI pen color number (MPEN_xxx ie 0..8)
                    [I&lt;n&gt;] means that &lt;n&gt; is Intuition dri pen number 0..11 (see
                            &quot;intuition/screens.h&quot;)
        ESC t[N], ESC t[N&lt;n&gt;], ESC t[NM&lt;n&gt;], ESC t[NI&lt;n&gt;]
                    Make the ESC T, ESC C,ESC B, ESC E become a single black line,
                    or not black when using a &lt;n&gt;, M&lt;n&gt; or I&lt;n&gt; pen color.
                    ('N' is for Not thick ;)

        with ESC O[] and ESC o[], you can add [...@&lt;n&gt;] which will make the image/object
        act as a relverify button. When this &quot;button&quot; is released NList will notify
        MUIA_NList_ButtonClick with the value &lt;n&gt;.

        with ESC I[], ESC O[] and ESC o[], you can add [...|&lt;width&gt;] or
        [...|&lt;width&gt;|&lt;height&gt;] or [...|&lt;width&gt;|&lt;height&gt;,&lt;minwidth&gt;] or
        [...,&lt;minwidth&gt;] where :
          &lt;width&gt; will be the width in pixels of the image/object.
                  -1  means default image width unless &lt;minwidth&gt; is set.
                   0  means default image width.
          &lt;height&gt; will be the height in pixels of the image/object.
                  -1  means default image height (entry height is max).
                   0  means entry height.
          &lt;minwidth&gt; will be the min width in pixels before the next char/string/image.
                  when present, default height become entry height and
                  width become minwidth (if minwdith is bigger than image default
                  width), unless you set &lt;width&gt; and/or &lt;height&gt;.
          &lt;minwidth&gt; &lt;width&gt; and &lt;height&gt; must be a decimal number (%ld).



MUIA_NList_DisplayHook2 -- [IS.], struct Hook *

        and A1 a NList_DisplayMessage struct pointer.



MUIA_NList_DisplayRecall -- [.S.], BOOL

    FUNCTION
        If for some unusual reason you modify one of the buffer that
        your DisplayHook function usually return anywhere else than
        in the DisplayHook function when called by the NList object,
        you must set it to TRUE, so the object will know it.



MUIA_NList_DoubleClick -- [..GN], LONG

    FUNCTION
        You'll get a notify on it each time the user double
        clicks on an entry in the list, or on the title.

        The value is the entry number, which will be -1 when
        it's the title.

        You'll get a notify on it too when you press the 'return' key
        and the NList object is active or default.

        If you get() it, you'll get the last click position, which
        can be -2 if it was on nothing (ie not entry or title).

        For triple clicks and more, use MUIA_NList_MultiClick.

    NOTE
        Disabled for the title when MUIA_NList_TitleClick is used.



MUIA_NList_DragColOnly -- [ISG], LONG

    FUNCTION
        When set to a col number (displayhook col number, not the visible
        one), only the text of that col for the selected entry will
        be dragged instead of the visible part of the entry.

        Set it to -1 to come back to standard/default mode when you have
        changed it !


MUIA_NList_DragSortable -- [ISG], BOOL

    FUNCTION
        Same function as List.mui/MUIA_List_DragSortable.

        DragType will be MUIV_NList_DragType_Default unless you set it.

        No need for you to set MUIA_Dropable or MUIA_Draggable.

    DEFAULT
        FALSE


MUIA_NList_DragSortInsert -- [..GN], BOOL

    FUNCTION
        Same as MUIA_NList_InsertPosition but the notify is made only after
        a MUIA_NList_DragSortable move.



MUIA_NList_DragType -- [ISG], LONG

    SPECIAL INPUTS
        MUIV_NList_DragType_None        no drag
        MUIV_NList_DragType_Default     as set in prefs.

        MUIV_NList_DragType_Borders     drag on borders and with qualifier.
        MUIV_NList_DragType_Qualifier   drag only using qualifier.

    FUNCTION
        Same function as Listview.mui/MUIA_Listview_DragType.

        If you want the user to be able to drag items out of
        your list, you must set this.
        Don't use MUIA_Draggable with NList or NListview.



MUIA_NList_DropMark -- [..G], LONG

    FUNCTION
        Same function as List.mui/MUIA_List_DropMark.

        After a successfull drop operation, this attribute holds
        the position where we should insert the new entry(ies).



MUIA_NList_DropType -- [..G], LONG

    FUNCTION
        Same function as MUIA_NList_DropMark but will return the
        current DropMark type instead of the DropMark entry number.

        After a successfull drop operation, this attribute holds
        the type of dropmark which where drawn.



MUIA_NList_Entries -- [..GN], LONG

    FUNCTION
        Same function as List.mui/MUIA_List_Entries.



MUIA_NList_EntryClick -- [..GN], LONG

    FUNCTION
        You'll get a notify on it each time the user click
        on an entry in the list (on the title, use
        MUIA_NList_TitleClick for that).

        The value is the entry number.

        You'll get a notify on it too when you press the 'return' key
        and the NList object is active or default, but only if there
        is no notify asked on MUIA_NList_DoubleClick.

        If you get() it, you'll get the last click position, which
        can be -1 when on title and -2 if it was on nothing.




MUIA_NList_EntryValueDependent -- [ISG], BOOL

    FUNCTION
        If your display hook return different strings when the
        entry num value change for a identical entry pointer
        then you should set it.

    DEFAULT
        FALSE



MUIA_NList_Exports -- [ISG], LONG

    FUNCTION
        Tell the NList object what parts of it's state will have to
        be saved in MUIM_Export method (which is called by the
        MUIM_Application_Save method if the object has a ObjectID).

    SPECIAL INPUTS
        MUIV_NList_Exports_Active       save active entry number.
        MUIV_NList_Exports_Selected     save selected entries numbers.
        MUIV_NList_Exports_First        save first visible entry number.

        MUIV_NList_Exports_All

    NOTE
        MUIV_NList_Exports_Selected can make a very long export (so a big program
        .cfg file) if the list has many selected entries. It take one long int
        (ie 4 bytes) for each selected entry...

        Active and First are always exported by the MUIM_Export method,
        having MUIV_NList_Exports_Active and MUIV_NList_Exports_First set or not.

    DEFAULT
        (MUIV_NList_Exports_Active | MUIV_NList_Exports_First | MUIV_NList_Exports_Cols)

        MUIV_NList_ForcePen_Off
        MUIV_NList_ForcePen_Default

    FUNCTION
        Set the ForcePen mode, when on it force the 'selected pen' color
        in all the selected area. Else the color is forced only at the
        beginning of the area and can be changed by text escape sequences.

        The default is set by the user in the pref .mcp class.

        Getting in will give its current value.


MUIA_NList_Format -- [ISG], STRPTR

    FUNCTION
        NList is able to handle multi column lists. To define
        how many columns should be displayed and how they
        should be formatted, you specify a format string.

        This format string must contain one entry for each column
        you want to see. Entries are seperated by commas, one
        entry is parsed via dos.library/ReadArgs().

        The template for a single entry looks like this:

        DELTA=D/N,PREPARSE=P/K,COL=C/N,BAR/S,TBAR/S,NOBAR=NB/S,
        SIMPLEBAR=SBAR/S,NOTITLEBUTTON=NOTB/S,
        WEIGHT=W/N,MINWIDTH=MIW/N,MAXWIDTH=MAW/N,
        COLWIDTH=CW/N,MINCOLWIDTH=MICW/N,MAXCOLWIDTH=MACW/N,
        PIXWIDTH=PW/N,MINPIXWIDTH=MIPW/N,MAXPIXWIDTH=MAPW/N,
        PARTCOLSUBST=PCS/K

    First ones are like (or nearly) MUIA_List_Format ones :

        DELTA
           Space in pixel between this column and the next.
           the last displayed column ignores this setting.
           Defaults to 4.

        PREPARSE
           A preparse string for this column.

        COL
           This value adjusts the col number of the current column.
           Defaults to current column number (0,1,...)
           You can't use identical COL values for 2 or more columns.

        BAR
           Will draw a vertical bar between this and the next column.

        WEIGHT
           The weight of the column. As for MUI's group.

        MINWIDTH
           Minimum percentage of the list width for the current column.

        MAXWIDTH
           Maximum percentage of the list width for the current column.

        TBAR
           Will draw a vertical bar between this and the next column
           but only in the title (ignored if BAR is set).
           THIS IS A DEFAULT !

        NOBAR
           Don't draw a vertical bar between this and the next column at all.

        SIMPLEBAR
           Make te vertical bar a simple black one.

        NOTITLEBUTTON
           Will prevent the title of the column to act as a relverify
           button when you set MUIA_NList_TitleClick (or make a notify
           on it).

        COLWIDTH
           Wanted number of chars for the current column.
           You will get as PIXWIDTH with number*font_with.
           Possibly more than number chars will fit in the
           column if you use proportional font, anyway you
           are sure than number non italic chars will fit.

        MINCOLWIDTH
           Minimum number of chars for the current column.

        MAXCOLWIDTH
           Maximum number of chars for the current column.

        PIXWIDTH
           Wanted number of chars for the current column.

        MINPIXWIDTH
           Minimum number of chars for the current column.

        MAXPIXWIDTH
           Maximum number of chars for the current column.

        PARTCOLSUBST
           If the partial column feature is turned on by the
           user (in his configuration) and the application
           developer has specified this option for a particular
           column, then a &quot;...&quot; text is displayed at the
           defined position if not all text fits into the
           column rather than showing a dotted vertical line
           at the end of the column. Possible values for
           this option are:

              DISABLED
                explicitly disables this feature for this
                column

              LEFT
                put &quot;...&quot; on the left side and strip text
                left aligned.

              CENTER
                put &quot;...&quot; at the center of the column and
                strip text on both sides around it.

              RIGHT
                put &quot;...&quot; on the right side and strip text
                right aligned.


        Note: You will have as many columns in your list as
              entries in the format string (i.e. number of
              commas + 1). Empty entries, e.g. with a format
              string of &quot;,,,,&quot; are perfectly ok.

        MINPIXWIDTH, MAXPIXWIDTH, MINCOLWIDTH, MAXCOLWIDTH,
        MINWIDTH and MAXWIDTH will not be used if PIXWIDTH,
        or COLWIDTH is used.

        Only one of PIXWIDTH, COLWIDTH and WEIGHT will be
        used, the first find in this order.
        Biggest of MINPIXWIDTH, MINCOLWIDTH and MINWIDTH.
        Smallest of MAXPIXWIDTH, MAXCOLWIDTH and MAXWIDTH.
        If the min is bigger than the max the min will be used.

        You should used PIX ones only for columns with images,
        and COL ones when you want to be sure to get as many
        chars you want.

        All chars/images will be drawn for the last column
        always, you should specify some width for it anyway
        as it will be used for centered and right aligned texts !

        Default values : WEIGHT=-1, MINWIDTH=5, MAXWIDTH=10000.

        Use MINWIDTH=0 if you don't use PIXWIDTH or COLWIDTH and
        don't want any min value.

        If you want to use WEIGHT values as percentage of the list
        width, just choose them to have their total being 100.

        WEIGHT = -1 mean that you want the column to have
        the width of the largest entry's column contents.
        MINWIDTH = -1 have the same meaning as for WEIGHT but for
        the min value.
        Default will be 100 for the last column, set it to -1 or
        -2 if you want to force it when more than one column, and
        to -2 to force it when only one column.

        Be aware that it can take long time to do that when there
        are many entries since this need a call to the dislpayhook,
        parse and find real length of all entries.
        Anyway using such stuff for one or more column has the
        same overhead.

        The default list format is an empty string (&quot;&quot;), this
        means a one column list without special formatting.

    NOTE
        Actually MUIA_NList_Format will not try to see if the new
        format is similar to previous one. It means that all
        column width will be re-computed (and all entries parsed
        if WEIGHT or MINWIDTH is -1), same for wrapping
        which will be recomputed for all entries.
        So, it's better to do it before inserting entries
        if you want to do both.
        If you want to clear, insert, and set the format, the
        best is to set the format after the clear (fastest, no
        entry to parse) and before the insert.

    BUGS (FEATURE)
        Currently there is a maximum of 64 columns for a list.

MUIA_NList_IgnoreSpecialChars -- [ISG], const char *

    FUNCTION
        Used to let NList ignore a list of user definable characters during
        string parsing. Some greek fonts need the 0xA0 character to display
        an Alpha characters. In this case the string &quot;\xa0&quot; should be supplied
        to make NList ignore this character and not treat 0xA0 as a &quot;non
        breaking space&quot;.
        This string will *NOT* be copied by NList and must remain valid as long
        as the object exists!

    DEFAULT
        NULL




MUIA_NList_Imports -- [ISG], LONG

    FUNCTION
        Tell the NList object what parts of it's state must be loaded
        (and used) in MUIM_Import method (which is called by the

MUIA_NList_InsertPosition -- [..GN], LONG

    FUNCTION
        Same function as List.mui/MUIA_List_InsertPosition.



MUIA_NList_KeepActive -- [.S.], Obj *

    FUNCTION
        Usefull when MUIA_NList_DefaultObjectOnClick if you
        don't want the specified object to be desactivated.
        A NListview object set it to it's NList child at
        creation time, so you should not have to use that tag.



MUIA_NList_KeyUpFocus -- [ISG], Object *

    FUNCTION
        Allows to specify a specific object that will be set as the new
        window's active object in case the user pressed the UP cursor key
        and the NList object itself doesn't have anything further to
        scroll up.



MUIA_NList_KeyDownFocus -- [ISG], Object *

    FUNCTION
        Allows to specify a specific object that will be set as the new
        window's active object in case the user pressed the DOWN cursor key
        and the NList object itself doesn't have anything further to
        scroll down.



MUIA_NList_KeyLeftFocus -- [ISG], Object *

    FUNCTION
        Allows to specify a specific object that will be set as the new
        window's active object in case the user pressed the LEFT cursor key
        and the NList object itself doesn't have anything further to
        scroll to the left.



MUIA_NList_KeyRightFocus -- [ISG], Object *

    FUNCTION
        Allows to specify a specific object that will be set as the new
        window's active object in case the user pressed the RIGHT cursor key
        and the NList object itself doesn't have anything further to
        scroll to the right.



MUIA_NList_LineHeight -- [..GN], LONG

    FUNCTION
        Get the current line height.



MUIA_NList_MakeActive -- [.S.], Obj *

    FUNCTION
        Use it if you want an object to be activated when you click
        in the list object.
        If you want to be able to control the list with key, you
        should use MUIA_NList_DefaultObjectOnClick instead.

        If you use both MUIA_NList_MakeActive and
        MUIA_NList_DefaultObjectOnClick then the specified object
        will be activated only if there is already an active one.

        The only object which should be set should be the NListview
        parent object of the current NList one.



MUIA_NList_MinColSortable -- [ISG], LONG

    FUNCTION
        Sets the number of the first visible column which
        can be sorted, ie exchanged with some other one.

        Default is 1, making the leftmost (0) column not sortable.

        Just set it to a big number (100 for example) to forbid
        the columns sorting.


MUIA_NList_MinLineHeight -- [IS.], LONG

    FUNCTION
        Same function as List.mui/MUIA_List_MinLineHeight.

        Sets the minimum line height for lists in pixels.

        If &lt;= 0 then it's absolute value will replace the
        'Leading' value of prefs which is added to the
        font height.

        It seems that original MUIA_List_MinLineHeight use
        its positive value as a 'leading' one, which is not
        logical when i read its doc (!), so i do the
        change internally to get it works like with list...


MUIA_NList_MultiClick -- [..GN], LONG

    FUNCTION
        You'll get a notify on it each time the user
        multiclicks more than 2 times on an entry in the
        list, or on the title. You'll get the number of
        the click (3, 4, 5...) for each. Note that you'll
        not get MUIA_NList_MultiClick for a double click;
        you must use MUIA_NList_DoubleClick for that.
        The time between each click must be less or equal
        to the double click time set in Amiga Input prefs.

        You can know on which entry the multiclick was made
        getting MUIA_NList_DoubleClick value.

        So you can make a notification on it.

    NOTE
        Disabled for the title when MUIA_NList_TitleClick is used.



MUIA_NList_MultiClickAlone -- [..GN], LONG

    FUNCTION
        You'll get a notify only for the final multiclick number,
        so if there are 3 clicks there will be only one multiclickalone
        notified, a little (max time between 2 clicks) after the 3rd one.
        It is the major change with classic MUIA_NList_DoubleClick and
        MUIA_NList_MultiClick which do the notify for all clicks.

        The drawback is the unavoidable delay between the last click
        and the notify.

        You can know on which entry the multiclickalone was made
        getting MUIA_NList_DoubleClick value.

        You can make a notification on it.

    FUNCTION
        Same function as List.mui/MUIA_List_Quiet.

        Think about using it when you insert/remove several entries
        one by one, it will go much faster.
        In all cases all changes which can be done later are delayed.
        Quiet_Full mean that no notify caused by changes in the list will
        be made, while Quiet_Visual will done them (but delayed to after
        the Quiet_None).

    SPECIAL INPUTS
        MUIV_NList_Quiet_None       same as FALSE.

MUIA_NList_SourceArray -- [I..], APTR

    FUNCTION
        Same function as List.mui/MUIA_List_SourceArray.



MUIA_NList_SourceInsert -- [I..], struct MUIP_NList_InsertWrap *

    FUNCTION
        Same as DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_InsertWrap,...)
        with ... same as the contents of the passed struct,
        but at init.




MUIA_NList_SourceString -- [I..], char *

    FUNCTION
        Same as
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_List_Insert,string,-2,MUIV_NList_Insert_Bottom)
        but at init.



MUIA_NList_TabSize -- [ISG], ULONG

        Same function as Floattext.mui/MUIA_Floattext_TabSize.

        Set how many spaces is the tabulation.

        Default is 8.


MUIA_NList_Title -- [ISG], char *

    FUNCTION
        Same function as List.mui/MUIA_List_Title.

        The title will be redraw each time you set it.

        When you use a display hook, its value is used as a BOOL/LONG
        which can have any value (just not NULL if you want to see it).

        The value returned by get() will be the same than the last one
        given in the set() or at init.



MUIA_NList_TitleClick -- [ISGN], LONG

    FUNCTION
        You'll get a notify on it each time the user
        clicks one the title (only if on a column, so not on the
        vertical bar column separator which is used to modify the
        column width with mouse).

        The returned value is the col number (display hook col number).

        If you get that value later, it will still be the latest
        *title* click col that you'll get.

        If you ask for a notify on that tag, or if you set it (with any
        value) the title will act as if each of its column titles were
        separated buttons, notifying that tag when there are released.

        The (released) look for those title &quot;buttons&quot; will be better
        if you use MUIA_NList_TitleSeparator and BAR or TBAR for each
        column in the MUIA_NList_Format string.

        There is no shortkeys for these custom buttons and never be,
        so think to give another way to access the related stuffs.

        Don't ask for customized frames for them :  there are not real
        MUI and separated buttons but directly handled by NList, and i
        found it nice as is.

    NOTE
        When you use MUIA_NList_TitleClick, you'll not receive
        MUIA_NList_DoubleClick and MUIA_NList_MultiClick when clicking
        on the title any more.

    EXAMPLES
        See NList-Demo program.

    FUNCTION
        Setting this tag you can choose between the classic
        list selection by line, or using a char precision
        selection.

        This should be used only for textviewer like stuff,
        and never for standard lists.
        Anyway its the only way to make direct copytoclip
        of a part of a line...

        Default is MUIV_NList_TypeSelect_Line of course.

        look at Area.mui/MUIA_Background and Image.mui/MUIA_Image_Spec
        to see what kind of value can be used.
        Anyway, you can set the defaults with prefs and so should
        not set it yourself.

		DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_Compare,APTR entry1,APTR entry2,
        ULONG sort_type1,ULONG sort_type2);

	FUNCTION
		This method is called ONLY by NList.mcc when application needs to
        compare    two    list   entries   f.e.   when   MUIM_NList_Sort,
        MUIM_NList_Sort2, MUIM_NList_Sort3 are called. So, this method is
        only  useful  within  NList.mcc  subclass, function method should
        looks      like      normal       MUIA_NList_CompareHook       or
		MUIA_NList_CompareHook2  hook function. If your subclass will not
        override this method NList.mcc implementation will be  used,  and
        it'll call MUIA_NList_CompareHook or MUIA_NList_CompareHook2 hook
        in that case.

        When you are overriding this method you probably  would  like  to
        override     MUIM_NList_Construct,     MUIM_NList_Destruct    and
        MUIM_NList_Display method as well.

	INPUTS
		entry1     - First entry to compare.

		entry2     - Second entry to compare.

		sort_type1 - Sort type 1.

		sort_type2 - Sort type 2.

	RESULTS
        If entry1 &gt; entry2 1, if entry1 ==  entry2  0  and  if  entry1  &lt;
        entry2    -1.    i.e.    the    same    as    MUIA_NList_Compare,
        MUIA_NList_CompareHook2 or strcmp() alike functions.

	NOTE
        Do not even think about calling it by yourself! Method parameters
        structure might grow in the future! Be warned.

        Internal implementation of this method can use internal or passed
        arguments,  so  please  do  not  cheating  and  if  you  are  not
		overriding it, pass the original arguments to super class.



MUIM_NList_Construct --

	SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_Construct,APTR entry,APTR pool);

    FUNCTION
        This method is called  ONLY  by  NList.mcc  when  application  is
        creating     new     entry     f.e.    when    MUIM_NList_Insert,
        MUIM_NList_InsertSingle or MUIM_NList_Replace is called. So, this
        method  is only useful within NList.mcc subclass, function method
        should   looks   like    normal    MUIA_NList_ConstructHook    or
        MUIA_NList_ConstructHook2  hook  function.  If your subclass will
        not override this method NList.mcc implementation will  be  used,
        and       it'll       call       MUIA_NList_ContructHook       or
		MUIA_NList_ConstructHook2 hook in that case.

        When you are overriding this method you probably  would  like  to
        override      MUIM_NList_Destruct,     MUIM_NList_Compare     and
        MUIM_NList_Display method as well.

	INPUTS
        entry - original entry pointer passed to  f.e.  MUIM_NList_Insert
				method. Equivalent of A1 register of
                MUIA_NList_ConstructHook.

		pool  - pool  header  pointer.  Equivalent  of  A2  register  of
                MUIA_NList_ConstructHook.

    RESULT
		New entry, similar as returned by one of construct hooks.

	NOTE
        Do not even think about calling it by yourself! Method parameters
        structure might grow in the future! Be warned.

        Internal implementation of this method can use internal or passed
        arguments,  so  please  do  not  cheating  and  if  you  are  not
		overriding it, pass the original arguments to super class.



MUIM_NList_ContextMenuBuild --

    SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_ContextMenuBuild, LONG mx, LONG my, LONG pos,
                                                LONG column, LONG flags,LONG ontop);

    FUNCTION
        Give possibilities to use MUIM_ContextMenuBuild builtin in NList
        and a custom context menu for a NList subclass.

        Here is how NList MUIM_ContextMenuBuild work :

        If MUIA_ContextMenu is NULL, NULL is returned (no menu).

        If MUIA_ContextMenu is none of special values, the supermethod is called.

        If MUIA_ContextMenu is MUIV_NList_ContextMenu_Never, MUIA_ContextMenu is
        set to NULL and NULL is returned.

        Else (it's a special value) MUIM_NList_ContextMenuBuild is called :

          If MUIM_NList_ContextMenuBuild return -1, NULL will be returned (no menu).

          If MUIM_NList_ContextMenuBuild return NULL, NList will return its own
          context menu, depending on prefs (it's the default case).

          If MUIM_NList_ContextMenuBuild return an menu object, NList will
          enable/disable its own menu entries in the menu if it found some,
          then return thqt object.

          2 special menuitems are reconized by NList, and are found by :
            DoMethod(MenuObj,MUIM_FindUData,MUIV_NList_Menu_Default_This)
          and
            DoMethod(MenuObj,MUIM_FindUData,MUIV_NList_Menu_Default_All)



        MUIA_ContextMenu special values are actuallly used :

          MUIV_NList_ContextMenu_Default   replaced by one of followings.
          MUIV_NList_ContextMenu_TopOnly   only on title/top of list.
          MUIV_NList_ContextMenu_Always    always.
          MUIV_NList_ContextMenu_Never     never, repaced by NULL after.

          when using MUIV_NList_ContextMenu_TopOnly NList will set MUIA_ContextMenu
          NULL/non-NULL when the mouse move, which should permit to have
          the window menu avaible when the contents menu is not visible.

          Anyway actually (MUI 3.8) MUI has a bug/feature which make the
          MUIA_ContextMenu being looked at only when the mouse *enter*
          within the object bounds. MUIV_NList_ContextMenu_TopOnly stuff
          will be nicer when that MUI problem is fixed...

        Of course if you want NList to do what has to be done when a menu item
        has been selected, your MUIM_ContextMenuChoice should call the supermethod.

    INPUTS (for MUIM_NList_ContextMenuBuild)

        mx      current mouse x.
        my      current mouse y.
        pos     entry number returned by NList_TestPos.
        column  column returned by NList_TestPos.
        flags   flags returned by NList_TestPos.
        ontop   TRUE if mouse is on title/top of the list.

    RESULT
        NULL, -1 or a menustrip object.

    EXAMPLES
        To make a ContextMenu but have the NList one appear when the
        mouse in on title/top, just set MUIA_ContextMenu,MUIV_NList_ContextMenu_Always
        and make MUIM_NList_ContextMenuBuild return NULL when ontop in TRUE (else
        return your menustrip object). Call MUIM_ContextMenuChoice supermethod too.

        To make your own context menu which have the same menuitems as ones
        in NList context menu, set MUIA_ContextMenu,MUIV_NList_ContextMenu_Always
        and make MUIM_NList_ContextMenuBuild return always your menustrip object.
        Make 4 menuitems in your menustrip object which will be like these :
        { NM_ITEM ,  &quot;Default Width: this&quot; , 0 ,0 ,0 ,(APTR) MUIV_NList_Menu_DefWidth_This },
        { NM_ITEM ,  &quot;Default Width: all&quot;  , 0 ,0 ,0 ,(APTR) MUIV_NList_Menu_DefWidth_All },
        { NM_ITEM ,  &quot;Default Order: this&quot; , 0 ,0 ,0 ,(APTR) MUIV_NList_Menu_DefOrder_This },
        { NM_ITEM ,  &quot;Default Order: all&quot;  , 0 ,0 ,0 ,(APTR) MUIV_NList_Menu_DefOrder_All },
        They will be automatically enabled/disabled as needed by NList  :)
        Call MUIM_ContextMenuChoice supermethod too.


MUIM_NList_CopyTo --

    SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_CopyTo, LONG pos, char *filename,
                                        APTR *result, APTR *entries);

    FUNCTION
        Do a copy to clipboard from some list entries or strings.

    INPUTS
        pos      entry number to be copied.
                 if MUIA_NList_CopyToClipHook is specified, it's what
                 it will return which will be copied instead of just
                 using the entry pointer as a string pointer.

                 special values :

            MUIV_NList_CopyTo_Active    copy list active entry
            MUIV_NList_CopyTo_Selected  copy list selected entries
            MUIV_NList_CopyTo_All       copy all list entries
            MUIV_NList_CopyTo_Entries   copy specified entries
            MUIV_NList_CopyTo_Entry     copy specified entry

            a &quot;\n&quot; will be insert after each entry contents.

        filename name of the file to copy to. If NULL then the copy will be
                 done to a string (strptr).
        result   LONG pointer which fill be filled with MUIV_NLCT_Success if
                 no error occured while opening and writing in the file, else
                 it will be filled with MUIV_NLCT_OpenErr, MUIV_NLCT_WriteErr
                 or MUIV_NLCT_Failed (failed somewhere when making copy data).

                 if filename is NULL, result will be filled with a string pointer
                 to a string allocated by AllocVec(). Datas will have been copied
                 in that string. YOU'LL HAVE TO FREE TAHT string pointer YOURSELF,
                 with a FreeVec(). If the returned string pointer is NULL then
                 the copy failed.
        entries  pointer to some entry, string, entries array or string array.
                 Its use depend on the pos value :
                 if MUIV_NList_CopyTo_Entry   then it's an entry pointer.
                 if MUIV_NList_CopyTo_Entries then it's an entry pointer
                                              array NULL terminated.
                 else :  not used, set to NULL.

    EXAMPLES
        LONG result = 0;
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_CopyTo, 5, &quot;RAM:test.txt&quot;, &amp;result, NULL, NULL);

          will copy the 5th entry to file RAM:test.txt, using
          MUIA_NList_CopyToClipHook if set.


        LONG result = 0;
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_CopyTo, MUIV_NList_CopyToClip_Selected,
                                            &quot;PRT:&quot;, &amp;result, NULL, NULL);
          will copy all selected entries to printer, using
          MUIA_NList_CopyToClipHook for each if set.


        char *strptr = NULL;
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_CopyTo, MUIV_NList_CopyTo_All,
                                            NULL, &amp;strptr, NULL, NULL);
          will copy all list entries to the string returned in strptr.
          you must make a FreeVec(strptr) by yourself after.



MUIM_NList_CopyToClip --

    SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_CopyToClip, LONG pos, ULONG clipnum,
                                            APTR *entries, struct Hook *hook);

    FUNCTION
        Do a copy to clipboard from some list entries or strings.

    INPUTS
        pos      entry number to be copied.
                 if MUIA_NList_CopyToClipHook is specified, it's what
                 it will return which will be copied instead of just
                 using the entry pointer as a string pointer.

                 special values :

            MUIV_NList_CopyToClip_Active    copy list active entry
            MUIV_NList_CopyToClip_Selected  copy list selected entries
            MUIV_NList_CopyToClip_All       copy all list entries

            MUIV_NList_CopyToClip_Strings   copy specified strings using hook
            MUIV_NList_CopyToClip_String    copy specified string using hook

            a &quot;\n&quot; will be insert after each entry contents, for all but
            MUIV_NList_CopyToClip_Strings and MUIV_NList_CopyToClip_String.

        clipnum  clipboard number to copy to.
        entries  pointer to some entry, string, entries array or string array.
                 Its use depend on the pos value :
                 if MUIV_NList_CopyToClip_Entry   then it's an entry pointer.
                 if MUIV_NList_CopyToClip_Entries then it's an entry pointer
                                                  array NULL terminated.
                 if MUIV_NList_CopyToClip_String  then it's a string pointer.
                 if MUIV_NList_CopyToClip_Strings then it's an string pointer
                                                  array NULL terminated.
                 else :  not used, set to NULL.
        hook     hook function which will be used (if not NULL) for
                 MUIV_NList_CopyToClip_Strings and
                 MUIV_NList_CopyToClip_String
                 instead of MUIA_NList_CopyToClipHook
                 Should be NULL most of time.

    EXAMPLES
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_CopyToClip, 5, 0, NULL, NULL);
          will copy the 5th entry to clipboard 0, using
          MUIA_NList_CopyToClipHook if set.

        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_CopyToClip, MUIV_NList_CopyToClip_Selected,
                                            0, NULL, NULL);
          will copy all selected entries to clipboard 0, using
          MUIA_NList_CopyToClipHook for each if set.

        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_CopyToClip, MUIV_NList_CopyToClip_String,
                                            0, &quot;my string&quot;, NULL);
          will copy &quot;my string&quot; to clipboard 0.

    NOTE
        MUIV_NList_CopyToClip_Strings and MUIV_NList_CopyToClip_String
        are here to permit simple text copy to clipboard for non nlist
        object related stuff (anyway a NList object must be here to use
        them...). They can use their own hook instead of nlist one if
        non NULL, anyway look at MUIA_NList_CopyToClipHook to see how
        this hook will be used.



MUIM_NList_CreateImage --

    SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_CreateImage,Object *imgobj, ULONG flags);

    FUNCTION
        Same function as List.mui/MUIM_List_CreateImage.

        Any transparent color in the source Bitmap/Bodychunk
        object will work (except if flags is ~0L).

        You must use MUIM_NList_CreateImage in Setup() or after
        and MUIM_NList_DeleteImage in Cleanup() or before,
        because the mri of the NList object must be valid.
        Setup() and Cleanup() are the best because MUI_ObtainPen()
        and MUI_ReleasePen() are used, and then pens will be
        released while iconification and will be re-obtained
        if the screen change.

        Take a look at MUIM_NList_UseImage which is far easier to
        use.

        Standard flags value is 0.

        If flags is ~0L then FillArea will not be set to FALSE on the object
        (for any other value, FillArea is set to FALSE)

        If flags is ~0L for a Bitmap/Bodychunk then it will be really the
        given object which will be drawn, as for non Bitmap/Bodychunk objects.


        The imgobj can (nearly) be any object, but take care of that :

        - the object should not test and use user inputs, the object
          should just be able to draw itself within the _left(obj),
          _top(obj), _width(obj) and height(obj) it will have when its
          Draw method is called.
        - the object class MUST NOT be Group or subclass of it.
        - the given imgobj must not be attached to any group object
          anywhere else, because a ADDMEMBER will be done with it.
        - Each imgobj can be used with one and only one NList object.
        - you can use the return pointer with ESC O[&lt;ptr&gt;] and ESC o[&lt;num&gt;].
        - the object will receive two tags just before its Draw method will
          be called : set(imgobj,MUIA_NLIMG_EntryCurrent,current_entry_number) and
          set(imgobj,MUIA_NLIMG_EntryHeight,height_of_each_entry_of_the_list)
          which are usefull in some case to draw things (see demo example).
        - a new stuff is to use it with ESC O[&lt;ptr&gt;;&lt;tag&gt;;&lt;value&gt;], in that case
          a set(imgobj,tag,value) will be done just before drawing it, so
          you can make an object which will draw different things when that tag
          value is changed. Setting this tag MUST NOT make the object being
          redrawn !!!
          &lt;tag&gt; and &lt;value&gt; must both be in hexadecimal (%lx).
        - if you use ;&lt;tag&gt;;&lt;value&gt; in one ESC sequence for an imgobj, you should
          use it everywhere you use that imgobj because there is no default for it.
        - The imgobj height will always be set to the entries height.
        - The mindefheight of imgobj will become the min height for entries.
        - Think it's still a new testing stuff...

        Note:
          Previously the object was disposed by NList at its end, actually a call
          to MUIM_NList_DeleteImage will REMMEMBER it, and so you have to dispose
          it yourself after !

        Look the demo program to see a way to use it...


    RESULT
        The result you get is a struct BitMapImage pointer which
        will exist between the MUIM_NList_CreateImage and
        MUIM_NList_DeleteImage, with a valid bitmap, width and
        height for the current screen.

        If you use it for a non Bitmap/Bodychunk object (or with flags
        set to ~0L) then the mask and imgbmp fields of the returned
        struct BitMapImage are not valid, and obtainpens is a pointer to
        the object.

        The only thing you should do with it is to include it in
        \33O[%08lx]. The result may be NULL in which case NList
        was unable to create the image, but the \33O[] combination
        simply draws nothing when receiving a NULL.

        ATTENTION:
        The returned pointer doesn't give the same structure than
        MUIM_List_CreateImage (in standard List class) would do :
        both are not compatible at all !



MUIM_NList_DeleteImage --

    SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_DeleteImage,APTR listimg);

    FUNCTION
        Same function as List.mui/MUIM_List_DeleteImage.

        Delete the image pointer returned from MUIM_NList_CreateImage.
        Read explains in MUIM_NList_CreateImage.




MUIM_NList_Destruct --

	SYNOPSIS
		DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_Destruct,APTR entry,APTR pool);

    FUNCTION
        This method is called  ONLY  by  NList.mcc  when  application  is
        deleting  entry f.e. when MUIM_NList_Remove or MUIM_NList_Replace
        are called. So, this  method  is  only  useful  within  NList.mcc
        subclass,    function    method    should   looks   like   normal
        MUIA_NList_DestructHook    or    MUIA_NList_DestructHook2    hook
        function.   If  your  subclass  will  not  override  this  method
        NList.mcc  implementation  will   be   used,   and   it'll   call
        MUIA_NList_DestructHook  or MUIA_NList_DestructHook2 hook in that
        case.

        When  you  are  overriding  this   method   you   must   override
        MUIM_NList_Construct    and   probably   MUIM_NList_Compare   and
        MUIM_NList_Display method as well.

    INPUTS
		entry - entry pointer returned by MUIM_NList_Construct method.

		pool  - pool header pointer.

    RESULT
        Currently undefined. If you are overriding it completely,  please
        return 0, if not use the value returned by super class!

	NOTE
        Do not even think about calling it by yourself! Method parameters
        structure might grow in the future! Be warned.

        Internal implementation of this method can use internal or passed
        arguments,  so  please  do  not  cheating  and  if  you  are  not
		overriding it, pass the original arguments to super class.



MUIM_NList_Display --

	SYNOPSIS

    FUNCTION
        This method is called  ONLY  by  NList.mcc  when  application  is
        displaying  entry  f.e.  when  MUI_Redraw(), MUIM_NList_Redraw or
        MUIM_NList_RedrawEntry are called. So, this method is only useful
        within  NList.mcc  subclass,  function  method  should looks like
        normal  MUIA_NList_DisplayHook  or  MUIA_NList_DisplayHook2  hook
        function.   If  your  subclass  will  not  override  this  method
        NList.mcc  implementation  will   be   used,   and   it'll   call
        MUIA_NList_DisplayHook  or  MUIA_NList_DisplayHook2  hook in that
        case.

    INPUTS
		entry - Entry  pointer  returned  by  f.e.  MUIM_NList_Construct,
				MUIA_NList_ConstructHook or MUIA_NList_ConstructHook2
				hooks.

		entry_pos - Entry position.

		strings   - Pointer to strings table.

		preparses - Pointer to preparse strings table.

    RESULT
        Currently undefined. If you are overriding it completely,  please
        return 0, if not use the value returned by super class!

	NOTE
        Do not even think about calling it by yourself! Method parameters
        structure might grow in the future! Be warned.

        Internal implementation of this method can use internal or passed
        arguments,  so  please  do  not  cheating  and  if  you  are  not
		overriding it, pass the original arguments to super class.



MUIM_NList_DoMethod --

    SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_DoMethod,LONG pos,
                      APTR DestObj,ULONG FollowParams,ULONG method,...);

    FUNCTION
        The given method will be executed for each selected entry, the
        active entry, all entries, or one specified entry of the NList
        object.

        Each DoMethod() can be done on the NList object, its _app object,
        a specified object, or the entry pointer if (and only if) it's
        an object.

        Following arguments can be automatically adjusted for each call
        using special values, like in the MUIM_Notify method (you must
        specified the numer of following argument too, as there will be
        copied in a temporary buffer - alloced in the stack).

    INPUTS
        pos -           the entry number for which you want to do the method.

          special values :
          MUIV_NList_DoMethod_Active    do it for the active entry.
          MUIV_NList_DoMethod_Selected  do it for all selected entries.
          MUIV_NList_DoMethod_All       do it

        DestObj -       the object on which the method will be done.

          special values :
          MUIV_NList_DoMethod_Entry     use entry pointer as target object for method.
          MUIV_NList_DoMethod_Self      use the NList object as target for method.
          MUIV_NList_DoMethod_App       use the _app(NList object) as target for method.

        FollowParams -  the number of following parameters (including &quot;method&quot;).
                        (maximum 40 to prevent errors and stack overflow)

        method -        the method which will be done.

        ... -           the method parameters.

          special values :
          MUIV_NList_EntryValue         replaced by the &quot;current&quot; entry pointer.
          MUIV_NList_EntryPosValue      replaced by the &quot;current&quot; entry number.
          MUIV_NList_SelfValue          replaced by the NList object.
          MUIV_NList_AppValue           replaced by _app(NList object)

    NOTES
        Don't use this to do things on the NList object when a specific way
        to do it exists (don't use it to remove entries in the nlist object
        itself for example).

        When using it in a notification, MUIV_TriggerValue and MUIV_TriggerValue
        special values will be replaced by the notify superclass as usual.

    EXAMPLES
        Insert all entries from nlist L1 to nlist L2 :

        DoMethod(L1, MUIM_NList_DoMethod, MUIV_NList_DoMethod_All,
          L2, 3,
          MUIM_NList_InsertSingle, MUIV_NList_EntryValue, MUIV_NList_Insert_Bottom);

        (it would be better to make set(L2,MUIA_NList_Quiet,TRUE) before and
         set(L2,MUIA_NList_Quiet,FALSE) after when there are many entries...)


        If the entries of nlist L1 are objects (and only in that case), you can do
        that to call a method (MUIM_Foo,x) for each selected of them :

        DoMethod(L1, MUIM_NList_DoMethod, MUIV_NList_DoMethod_Selected,
          MUIV_NList_DoMethod_Entry, 2,
          MUIM_Foo,x);



MUIM_NList_DropDraw --

    SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_DropDraw, LONG pos, LONG type,
                                          LONG minx,LONG maxx,LONG miny,LONG maxy);

    FUNCTION
        This method MUST NOT be called directly !

        It will be called by NList, and will draw the drop mark previously fixed
        (pos and type) by MUIM_NList_DropType within the minx, maxx, miny, maxy
        in the _rp(obj) rasport. You must not draw outside of the given box,
        because only the corresponding NList entry will be refreshed to erase what
        is drawn in that method.

        Calling the supermethod (so the builtin MUIM_NList_DropDraw method) will draw
        the standard dropmark specified by (type &amp; MUIV_NList_DropType_Mask), so
        MUIV_NList_DropType_None,MUIV_NList_DropType_Above,MUIV_NList_DropType_Below
        or MUIV_NList_DropType_Onto.

        You can draw directly in the rastport (or a clone of it) in that method,
        because it will be called from the Draw method within the DragReport in
        Refresh mode.



MUIM_NList_DropEntryDrawErase --

    SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_DropEntryDrawErase,LONG type,LONG drawpos,LONG erasepos);

    FUNCTION
        This method MUST NOT be called directly !

        It will be called by NList while the DragReport just before the redraw
        which will draw a new mark or erase the old one.

        This method can be used to change something so your displayhook will return
        something different for the marked entry, like changing its color or making
        it bold or italic.

        Don't call the superclass unless you know that the superclass use it.

        You should return 0.

    INPUTS
        type has the same meaning as *type in MUIM_NList_DropType, it will be useless
        in most cases (and has no meanning at all for erasepos).

        drawpos is the entry number which will be draw with a dropmark, -1 mean none.

        erasepos is the entry number which is not any more the dropmark one, -1 mean none.



MUIM_NList_DropType --

    SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_DropType, LONG *pos,LONG *type,
                                          LONG minx,LONG maxx,LONG miny,LONG maxy,
                                          LONG mousex,LONG mousey);

    FUNCTION
        This method MUST NOT be called directly !

        It will be called by NList while the DragReport, with default *pos and *type
        values depending on the drag pointer position that you can modify as you want.

        Default *type can be MUIV_NList_DropType_Above or MUIV_NList_DropType_Below.
        You can change it to any of MUIV_NList_DropType_None,MUIV_NList_DropType_Above,
        MUIV_NList_DropType_Below and MUIV_NList_DropType_Onto if you want, using
        the mouse position and the entry box.

        You can make you own *type value as soon as you don't set it in
        MUIV_NList_DropType_Mask, and so draw what you want depending on that value
        in the MUIM_NList_DropDraw method.

        Note that any MUIV_NList_DropType_Below *type will be changed to
        MUIV_NList_DropType_Above with a *pos incremented by 1 just after the
        return of that method.

        If you change the *pos, the list will be scrolled to see it (if the value is
        correct).

        getting MUIA_NList_DropType or MUIA_NList_DropMark will return the same values
        as *pos and *type.

        If your subclass is a direct NList subclass, then there is no need to call
        the supermethod which done nothing at all !



MUIM_NList_Exchange --

    SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_Exchange,LONG pos1, LONG pos2);

    FUNCTION
        Same function as List.mui/MUIM_List_Exchange.

        Exchange two entries in a NList object.

    SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_GetEntry,LONG pos, APTR *entry);

    FUNCTION
        Same function as List.mui/MUIM_List_GetEntry.

    SPECIAL INPUTS
        MUIV_NList_GetEntry_Active    give active entry (or NULL if none)



MUIM_NList_GetEntryInfo --

    SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_GetEntryInfo,struct MUI_NList_GetEntryInfo *res);

    FUNCTION
        You get usefull informations about some entry from its number,
        or from the real line number which can be different when there
        is word wrap in the list.

    INPUTS
        res - pointer to a MUI_NList_GetEntryInfo struct :
              LONG pos;       number of entry you want info about */
              LONG line;      real line number */
              LONG entry_pos; entry number of returned entry ptr */
              APTR entry;     entry pointer */
              LONG wrapcol;   NOWRAP, WRAPCOLx, or WRAPPED|WRAPCOLx */
              LONG charpos;   start char number in string (unused if NOWRAP) */
              LONG charlen;   string lenght (unused if NOWRAP) */

              if pos is MUIV_NList_GetEntryInfo_Line then the method will
              use the line number to search infos, else line will be set
              to its correct number for the value of pos.
              entry is the entry ptr, think that if it's a word wrapped
              entry then it come from the returned entry_pos entry.
              Think too that if wrapcol tell you that it's a WRAPPED entry,
              only the WRAPCOLx col is drawn, from the charpos position
              in the string returned by DisplayHook for the column and for
              entry_pos/entry.



MUIM_NList_GetPos --

    SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_GetPos,APTR entry,LONG *pos);

    FUNCTION
        Give the (next) entry number which have the given entry number.
        It's the entry ptr which is stored in the list, ie the one returned
        by the ConstructHook if any.

    INPUTS
        entry - Entry ptr of the entry you want to get the pos.

        pos - a pointer to longword that will hold the next entry number
              of the given entry ptr. Must be set to MUIV_NList_GetPos_Start
              if you want to search from the beginning of the list.
              Is set to MUIV_NList_GetPos_End no more is found.




MUIM_NList_GetSelectInfo --

    SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_GetSelectInfo,struct MUI_NList_GetSelectInfo *res);

    FUNCTION
        You get usefull informations about selected entries state.

    INPUTS
        res - pointer to a MUI_NList_GetSelectInfo struct :
        LONG start        num of first selected *REAL* entry/line (first of wrapped from which start is issued)
        LONG end          num of last selected *REAL* entry/line (first of wrapped from which start is issued)
        LONG num          not used
        LONG start_column column of start of selection in 'start' entry
        LONG end_column   column of end of selection in 'end' entry
        LONG start_pos    char pos of start of selection in 'start_column' entry
        LONG end_pos      char pos of end of selection in 'end_column' entry
        LONG vstart       num of first visually selected entry (ie can be the 2nd or 3rd line of a word wrap entry)
            LONG vend         num of last visually selected entry (ie can be the 2nd or 3rd line of a word wrap entry)
            LONG vnum         number of visually selected entries

    NOTE
        If no entry is selected, then start, end, vstart, vend are -1, vnum is 0.

        When start_column, end_column, start_pos, end_pos are -1 then the whole line/entry/column
        is selected.

        start_column, end_columb, start_pos and end_pos have the same meaning than
        parameters passed to the MUIA_NList_CopyEntryToClipHook.

        remember than in case of automatically added word wrapped entries, only
        the concerned column have any contents. You get that case for 'vstart'
        when 'start' is different, and for 'end' when 'vend' is different.



MUIM_NList_Insert --

                  If count==-2 then entries must be a string pointer
                  which can be multiline with \n , \r or \r\n separators.
                  You'll get as many entries inserted as lines in the string.

                                           reordering of the columns. This could
                                           speed up the insert of entries very
                                           significant but will not automatically
                                           change the width of a column.

        area, even the first and last which can be very partially selected.

    INPUTS
        pos - a pointer to longword that will hold the number
              of the returned entry. Must be set to
              MUIV_NList_PrevSelected_Start at start of iteration.

        Same function as List.mui/MUIM_List_Redraw.
        Redraw some entry or all.

    INPUTS
        pos - Number of the line to redraw. When the line is not
              currently visible, nothing will happen. Specials:
              MUIV_NList_Redraw_Active   redraw the active line (if any),
              MUIV_NList_Redraw_All      redraw all lines.

    FUNCTION
        Redraw some entry, like MUIM_NList_Redraw, but using the entry
        pointer instead of the entry number.

    INPUTS
        entry - Entry ptr of the entry (entries) you want to be redraw.



MUIM_NList_Remove --

    SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_Remove,LONG pos);

    FUNCTION
        Same function as List.mui/MUIM_List_Remove.

    INPUTS
        pos - number of the entry to be removed or one of
              MUIV_NList_Remove_First
              MUIV_NList_Remove_Active
              MUIV_NList_Remove_Selected
              MUIV_NList_Remove_Last

              the following entry will become active.
              When the active is the removed and is the last,
              the new last become active.



MUIM_NList_ReplaceSingle --

    FUNCTION
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_ReplaceSingle,
                      APTR entry, LONG pos, LONG wrapcol, LONG align);

    FUNCTION
        Same function as MUIM_NList_InsertSingleWrap but replace an existing
        entry rather than inserting.
        It's better to do a direct replace than remove then insert it !

    INPUTS
        entry   - item to insert.

        pos     - position of the entry to be replaced
                MUIV_NList_Insert_Top     replace the first entry.
                MUIV_NList_Insert_Active  replace the active entry.
                MUIV_NList_Insert_Bottom  replace the last entry.
                Invalid positions will cause the replacement to fail!

        wrapcol - WRAPCOL0 to WRAPCOL6. You can't ask word wrap for an
                other col. NOWRAP if you don't want word wrap.
                So only one of (display hook) col 0 to 6 can be wrapped.

        align   - ALIGN_LEFT, ALIGN_CENTER, ALIGN_RIGHT or ALIGN_JUSTIFY.
                be aware that align will be used if there is no escape
                align sequence in the preparses or column entry string.

    FUNCTION
        Same function as List.mui/MUIM_List_Select when in TypeSelect_Line mode.

        In TypeSelect_Char mode, MUIV_NList_Select_Off will clear the selected
        area (don't look what is pos). MUIV_NList_Select_On will select the
        pos entry only (can be MUIV_NList_Select_Active or MUIV_NList_Select_All).
        MUIV_NList_Select_Ask will give the number off entry in the selected area.

    INPUTS

        pos     - Number of the entry or
                  MUIV_NList_Select_Active  for the active entry.

                  MUIV_NList_Select_Ask     just ask about the state.

        state   - Pointer to a longword. If not NULL, this will
                  be filled with the current selection state.



MUIM_NList_SelectChange -- Called on every selection change (V19.98)

    SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_SelectChange,LONG pos, LONG state, ULONG flags);

    FUNCTION
        This method cannot/should not be called. It's purpose is only to indicate
        selection state changes of entries in a more powerfull form than
        MUIA_NList_SelectChange does.
        It is only called when you are in line mode ie. MUIA_NList_TypeSelect is
        set to MUIV_NList_TypeSelect_Line, which is the default.

        pos     - The position of the (un)selected entry. Can be
                  MUIV_NList_Active_Off or something.
        state   - The resulting state of the entry which can be MUIV_NList_Select_On,
                  MUIV_NList_Select_Off or MUIV_NList_Select_Active.
        flags   - Can be MUIV_NList_SelectChange_Flag_Multi for now which means
                  that the entry was selected while holding down the mouse button.

    INPUTS



MUIM_NList_SetActive -- make a specific entry the active one (v20.125)

    SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj, MUIM_NList_SetActive, LONG pos, ULONG flags);

    FUNCTION
        This method is a replacement function for the old-style way of making an
        entry active via a simple set(obj, MUIA_NList_Active, pos) call. While the
        old method still works, this new function has the advantage that it allows
        to set an entry active together with making it immediately visible in the
        listview.
        Previously, a developer had to do a combination of a set() call to set
        MUIA_NList_Active and then immediately perform a MUIM_NList_Jump function
        call so that the entry becomes visible at the specific position. With this
        new function both operations are combined, potentially allowing future
        enhancements to be added via the additional 'flags' variable.

    INPUTS
        The parameter description is as followed:

        pos     - The position (int) of the entry which should be made the new
                  active entry. This can also be MUIV_NList_Active_XXXX values as
                  explained in the MUIA_NList_Active documentation. Furthermore,
                  pos might also be perfectly a pointer to the entry directly in
                  case you have specified the correct flag.

        flags   - Can be a combination of the following flags:

                  MUIV_NList_SetActive_Entry:

                    the parameter 'pos' will be a pointer to the entry rather
                    than the position (int) of the entry to be made active. If
                    this flag is set NList will perform an internal GetPos()
                    operation to first obtain the position and then set
                    this entry active.

                  MUIV_NList_SetActive_Jump_Center:

                    Together with making the specified entry the new active one
                    the listview will also be scrolled so that the new entry
                    will be shown centered instead of having it simply visible.



MUIM_NList_SetColumnCol --

    SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_SetColumnCol,LONG column,LONG col);

    FUNCTION
        set which displayhook col is at the visible column.

    INPUTS
        column  number of the column (visible).
                if MUIV_NList_SetColumnCol_Default then the given (diplayhook) col
                will come back to its default/original (from List_Format) position.

        col     col number (displayhook one).
                if MUIV_NList_SetColumnCol_Default then the given visible column
                will come back to its default/original (from List_Format) position.


                both set to MUIV_NList_SetColumnCol_Default make all columns
                come back to their default/original (from List_Format) position.

    RESULT
        None.

    NOTE
        MUIM_NList_SetColumnCol always exchange the moved column with the column
        which was were it move.



MUIM_NList_Sort --

    SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_Sort);

    FUNCTION
        Same function as List.mui/MUIM_List_Sort.



MUIM_NList_Sort2 --

    SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_Sort2,LONG sort_type, LONG sort_type_add);

    FUNCTION
        Same function as MUIM_NList_Sort but will set MUIA_NList_SortType
        before starting the sort.

        It is really usefull only if you use MUIA_NList_CompareHook2 instead
        of classic MUIA_NList_CompareHook so your hook will be able to do
        different type of sort when NList_SortType change.

    INPUTS
        sort_type     - The new MUIA_NList_SortType value (see below).

        sort_type_add - If 0 then sort_type will be the new MUIA_NList_SortType,
                        else if current MUIA_NList_SortType &amp; MUIV_NList_SortTypeValue_Mask
                        is same as sort_type then sort_type_add will be added to the
                        MUIA_NList_SortType value,
                        else sort_type will be the new MUIA_NList_SortType.

                        See examples for special values.

    EXAMPLES
        Many times this method will be used to sort multicolumn list in different
        ways when the user click on title buttons :

        DoMethod(list,MUIM_Notify,MUIA_NList_TitleClick, MUIV_EveryTime,
          list, 3, MUIM_NList_Sort2, MUIV_TriggerValue, MUIV_NList_SortTypeAdd_xxx);

        if MUIV_NList_SortTypeAdd_None    then the hook sort_type value will be the column
                                          number.
        if MUIV_NList_SortTypeAdd_2Values then the hook sort_type value will be a cycle of
                                          values which change on each click :
                                          o Column number  (first time)
                                          o Column number + MUIV_NList_SortTypeAdd_2Values
                                          o back to column number ...

        if MUIV_NList_SortTypeAdd_4Values then the hook sort_type value will be a cycle of
                                          values which change on each click :
                                          o Column number  (first time)
                                          o Column number + MUIV_NList_SortTypeAdd_4Values
                                          o Column number + MUIV_NList_SortTypeAdd_4Values*2
                                          o Column number + MUIV_NList_SortTypeAdd_4Values*3
                                          o back to column number ...
        See NList-Demo program.



MUIM_NList_Sort3 --

    SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_Sort3,LONG sort_type, LONG sort_type_add, LONG which);

    FUNCTION
        Same function as MUIM_NList_Sort2 but will set MUIA_NList_SortType,
        MUIA_NList_SortType2 or both before starting the sort.

        When using MUIV_NList_Sort3_SortType_Both the method will change
        MUIA_NList_SortType exactly the same way as MUIM_NList_Sort2 would do
        it, then copy that value to MUIA_NList_SortType2.

        It is really usefull only if you use MUIA_NList_CompareHook2 instead
        of classic MUIA_NList_CompareHook so your hook will be able to do
        different type of sort when NList_SortType change.

    INPUTS
        sort_type     - The new MUIA_NList_SortType/2 value.

        sort_type_add - If 0 then sort_type will be the new MUIA_NList_SortType/2,
                        else if current MUIA_NList_SortType/2 &amp; MUIV_NList_SortTypeValue_Mask
                        is same as sort_type then sort_type_add will be added to the
                        MUIA_NList_SortType/2 value,
                        else sort_type will be the new MUIA_NList_SortType/2.

        which         - MUIV_NList_Sort3_SortType_1      set MUIA_NList_SortType value.
                        MUIV_NList_Sort3_SortType_2      set MUIA_NList_SortType2 value.
                        MUIV_NList_Sort3_SortType_Both   set MUIA_NList_SortType value
                                                         then copy it to MUIA_NList_SortType2.

    EXAMPLES
        See NList-Demo program.



MUIM_NList_TestPos --

    SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_TestPos,LONG x, LONG y, struct MUI_NList_TestPos_Result *res);

    FUNCTION
        Find out which informations of a list which is currently
        displayed at a certain position.

        You must give a pointer to a valid MUI_NList_TestPos_Result struct.

        Set x AND y to MUI_MAXMAX to get infos about the last click position !

        See NList_mcc.h to know what values will be set in the struct.

        Preset char_number to -2 in the struct to not get char_number and char_xoffset
        informations. It's usefull if you don't need them because it will be
        faster for the method without finding them. the -2 value will stay valid
        for next call.

        You'll get char number from what you return from the DisplayHook if there is
        one, else from the beginning of the string/entry ptr.

        Be aware: if you use MUIM_List_TestPos you have to give a pointer to a
        struct MUI_List_TestPos_Result, and you'll get same infos as using a List object.
        It wasn't done as is before, makeing enforcer hits when trying to use NList
        or NFloattext with a Listview instead of a NListview (avoid it please, it's not
        done for it as Listview try to make many things itself, with possible conficts),
        because struct MUI_NList_TestPos_Result is bigger !!!

    NOTE
        column in the struct MUI_NList_TestPos_Result is the visible column number !



MUIM_NList_UseImage --

    SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_UseImage,Object *obj, ULONG imgnum, ULONG flags);

    FUNCTION
        If you want to use MUIM_NList_CreateImage/MUIM_NList_DeleteImage
        as you should, you must make a NList subclass which call them
        from Setup() and Cleanup(), and it's sometime complicated.

        To avoid that, you can use MUIM_NList_UseImage. NList will
        store the Bitmap/Bodychunk object you give and will make
        CreateImage and DeleteImage itself !

        MUIM_NList_UseImage can use same object as MUIM_NList_CreateImage !

        NULL is a valid obj. It will erase any previously UseImage
        with the same imgnum.

        The imgnum you give is the number that you will use in
        \33o[&lt;n&gt;] sequence as the &lt;n&gt; number.
        MUIM_NList_UseImage will accept 0 &lt;= imgnum &lt; 8192, anyway
        use small value if you can because an array will be allocated
        with the biggest imgnum value as size to store the
        Bitmap/Bodychunk objects.

        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NList_UseImage, NULL, MUIV_NList_UseImage_All, 0)
        will set NULL to all stored objects, so you'll be able to dispose your
        Bitmap/Bodychunk objects if you want, without waiting the NList
        objet dispose.

        flags is the same than for MUIM_NList_CreateImage (0 unless special case).

    RESULT
        TRUE if succeeded to store the obj (and allocate the array
        if needed), else FALSE.

        There is no way to know if the MUIM_NList_CreateImage
        needed to draw will succeed/has succeeded.

        ATTENTION:
        The given Bitmap/Bodychunk object MUST be valid until the
        NList object is disposed or you set another object (or NULL)
        at the same imgnum !
        The Bitmap/Bodychunk object can be shared with other NList
        object because NList just use it to get informations, anyway
        you mustn't change informations of that object. If you to do
        so, do a UseImage,NULL,x , change it then do UseImage,imgobj,x
        again.

&lt;/pre&gt;

    There are two possible entry-types in a NListtree class list:
    Leaves and nodes. Leaves are simple entries which have no special
    features except they are holding some data. Nodes are almost
    the same type, holding data too, but having a list attached
    where you can simply add other entries which can be again leaves
    or nodes.

    Every node is structured as follows:

        struct MUI_NListtree_TreeNode {

            struct    MinNode    tn_Node;
            STRPTR    tn_Name;
            UWORD    tn_Flags;
            APTR    tn_User;
        };

    It contains a name field tn_Name, flags tn_Flags and a pointer to
    user data tn_User.

    The tn_Flags field can hold the following flags:

        TNF_LIST        The node contains a list where other nodes
                        can be inserted.

        TNF_OPEN        The list node is open, sub nodes are displayed.

        TNF_FROZEN        The node doesn't react on doubleclick or
                        open/close by the user.

        TNF_NOSIGN        The indicator of list nodes isn't shown.

        TNF_SELECTED    The entry is currently selected.

    These flags, except TNF_SELECTED, can be used in
    MUIM_NListtree_Insert at creation time. They will be passed to
    the newly created entry. Also you can do a quick check about the
    state and kind of each entry. But - NEVER EVER - modify any flag
    yourself or NListtree will crash. Be warned!

    *********************************************************************
        THE ABOVE STRUCT IS READ-ONLY!! NEVER CHANGE ANY ENTRY OF THIS
        STRUCTURE DIRECTLY NOR THINK ABOUT THE CONTENTS OF ANY PRIVATE
                        FIELD OR YOU WILL DIE IN HELL!
    *********************************************************************


    You can create very complex tree structures. NListtree only uses
    one list which holds all information needed and has no extra
    display list like other list tree classes ;-)

    The tree nodes can be inserted and removed, sorted, moved, exchanged,
    renamed  or multi  selected.  To sort you can also  drag&amp;drop  them.
    Modifications can be made in relation to the whole tree, to only one
    level, to a sub-tree or to only one tree node.

    The user can control the listtree by the MUI keys, this means a node
    is opened with &quot;Right&quot; and closed with &quot;Left&quot;. Check your MUI prefs
    for the specified keys.

    You can define which of the columns will react on double-clicking.
    The node toggles its status from open or closed and vice versa.


    Drag&amp;Drop capabilities:

    If you set MUIA_NList_DragSortable to TRUE, the list tree will
    become active for Drag&amp;Drop. This means you can drag and drop
    entries on the same list tree again. While dragging an indicator
    shows where to drop.

        Drag a    Drop on        Result

        leaf    leaf        Exchange leaves.
        node    leaf        Nothing happens.
        entry    closed node    Move entry, the compare hook is used.
        entry    open node    Move entry to defined position.

    You can not drop an entry on itself, nor can you drop an opened node on
    any of its members.

    To exchange data with other objects, you have to create your own
    subclass of NListtree class and react on the drag methods.



MUIA_NListtree_Active -- [.SG], struct MUI_NListtree_TreeNode *


   SPECIAL VALUES

        MUIV_NListtree_Active_Off
        MUIV_NListtree_Active_Parent
        MUIV_NListtree_Active_First
        MUIV_NListtree_Active_FirstVisible
        MUIV_NListtree_Active_LastVisible


   FUNCTION

    Setting this attribute will move the cursor to the defined tree node
    if it is visible. If the node is in an opened tree the listview is
    scrolling into the visible area. Setting MUIV_NListtree_Active_Off will
    vanish the cursor.

    MUIV_NListtree_Active_First/FirstVisible/LastVisible are special values
    for activating the lists first or the top/bottom visible entry.

    See MUIA_NListtree_AutoVisible for special activation features.

    If this attribute is read it returns the active tree node. The result
    is MUIV_NListtree_Active_Off if there is no active entry.


   NOTIFICATIONS

    You can create a notification on MUIA_NListtree_Active. The
    TriggerValue is the active tree node.





MUIA_NListtree_ActiveList -- [..G], struct MUI_NListtree_TreeNode *

   SPECIAL VALUES

        MUIV_NListtree_ActiveList_Off


   FUNCTION

    If this attribute is read it returns the active list node. The
    active list node is always the parent of the active entry.
    The result is MUIV_NListtree_ActiveList_Off if there is no
    active list (when there is no active entry).


   NOTIFICATIONS

    You can create notifications on MUIA_NListtree_ActiveList. The
    TriggerValue is the active list node.




MUIA_NListtree_AutoVisible -- [ISG], struct MUI_NListtree_TreeNode *

   SPECIAL VALUES

        MUIV_NListtree_AutoVisible_Off
        MUIV_NListtree_AutoVisible_Normal
        MUIV_NListtree_AutoVisible_FirstOpen
        MUIV_NListtree_AutoVisible_Expand


   FUNCTION

    Set this to make your list automatically jump to the active
    entry.

        MUIV_NListtree_AutoVisible_Off:
            The display does NOT scroll the active entry into the
            visible area.

        MUIV_NListtree_AutoVisible_Normal:
            This will scroll the active entry into the visible area
            if it is visible (entry is a member of an open node).
            This is the default.

        MUIV_NListtree_AutoVisible_FirstOpen:
            Nodes are not opened, but the first open parent node of
            the active entry is scrolled into the visible area if the
            active entry is not visible.

        MUIV_NListtree_AutoVisible_Expand:
            All parent nodes are opened until the first open node is
            reached and the active entry will be scrolled into the
            visible area.





MUIA_NListtree_CloseHook -- [IS.], struct Hook *

   SPECIAL VALUES


   FUNCTION

    The close hook is called after a list node is closed, then you can
    change the list.

    The close hook will be called with the hook in A0, the object in A2
    and a MUIP_NListtree_CloseMessage struct in A1 (see nlisttree_mcc.h).

    To remove the hook set this to NULL.




MUIA_NListtree_CompareHook -- [IS.], struct Hook *

   SPECIAL VALUES

        MUIV_NListtree_CompareHook_Head
        MUIV_NListtree_CompareHook_Tail
        MUIV_NListtree_CompareHook_LeavesTop
        MUIV_NListtree_CompareHook_LeavesMixed
        MUIV_NListtree_CompareHook_LeavesBottom


   FUNCTION

    Set this attribute to your own hook if you want to sort the entries in
    the list tree by your own way.

    When you sort your list or parts of your list via MUIM_NListtree_Sort,
    using the insert method with MUIV_NListtree_Insert_Sort or dropping an
    entry on a closed node, this compare hook is called.

    There are some builtin compare hooks available, called:

        MUIV_NListtree_CompareHook_Head
            Any entry is inserted at head of the list.

        MUIV_NListtree_CompareHook_Tail
            Any entry is inserted at tail of the list.

        MUIV_NListtree_CompareHook_LeavesTop
            Leaves are inserted at top of the list, nodes at bottom. They are
            alphabetically sorted.

        MUIV_NListtree_CompareHook_LeavesMixed
            The entries are only alphabetically sorted.

        MUIV_NListtree_CompareHook_LeavesBottom
            Leaves are inserted at bottom of the list, nodes at top. They are
            alphabetically sorted. This is default.

    The hook will be called with the hook in A0, the object in A2 and
    a MUIP_NListtree_CompareMessage struct in A1 (see nlisttree_mcc.h). You
    should return something like:

        &lt;0    (TreeNode1 &lt;  TreeNode2)
         0    (TreeNode1 == TreeNode2)
        &gt;0    (TreeNode1 &gt;  TreeNode2)




MUIA_NListtree_ConstructHook -- [IS.], struct Hook *

   SPECIAL VALUES

        MUIV_NListtree_ConstructHook_String

        MUIV_NListtree_ConstructHook_Flag_AutoCreate
            If using the KeepStructure feature in MUIM_NListtree_Move or
            MUIM_NListtree_Copy, this flag will be set when calling your
            construct hook. Then you can react if your hook is not simply
            allocating memory.


   FUNCTION

    The construct hook is called whenever you add an entry to your
    listtree. The pointer isn't inserted directly, the construct hook is
    called and its result code is added.

    When an entry shall be removed the corresponding destruct hook is
    called.

    The construct hook will be called with the hook in A0, the object in
    A2 and a MUIP_NListtree_ConstructMessage struct in A1 (see
    nlisttree_mcc.h).
    The message holds a standard kick 3.x memory pool pointer. If you want,
    you can use the exec or amiga.lib functions for allocating memory
    within this pool, but this is only an option.

    If the construct hook returns NULL, nothing will be added to the list.

    There is a builtin construct hook available called
    MUIV_NListtree_ConstructHook_String. This expects that the field
    'tn_User' in the treenode is a string pointer (STRPTR), which's
    string is copied.
    Of course you have to use MUIV_NListtree_DestructHook_String in
    this case!

    To remove the hook set this to NULL.

    NEVER pass a NULL pointer when you have specified the internal string
    construct/destruct hooks or NListtree will die!




MUIA_NListtree_CopyToClipHook -- [IS.],

   SPECIAL VALUES

        MUIV_NListtree_CopyToClipHook_Default


   FUNCTION

        This thing works near like MUIA_NListtree_DisplayHook, but is
        called when the NListtree object want to make a clipboard copy.

        You can return only one string pointer. If you return NULL,
        nothing will be copied. If you return -1, the entry will be
        handled as a normal string and the name field is used.

        The builtin hook skips all ESC sequences and adds a tab char
        between columns.





MUIA_NListtree_DestructHook -- [IS.], struct Hook *

   SPECIAL VALUES

        MUIV_NListtree_DestructHook_String


   FUNCTION

    Set up a destruct hook for your listtree. The destruct hook is called
    whenevere you remove an entry from the listtree. Here you can free memory
    which was allocated by the construct hook before.

    The destruct hook will be called with the hook in A0, the object
    in A2 and a MUIP_NListtree_DestructMessage struct in A1 (see
    nlisttree_mcc.h).
    The message holds a standard kick 3.x memory pool pointer. You must
    use this pool when you have used it inside the construct hook to
    allocate pooled memory.

    There is a builtin destruct hook available called
    MUIV_NListtree_DestructHook_String. This expects that the 'User' data
    in the treenode is a string and you have used
    MUIV_NListtree_ConstructHook_String in the construct hook!

    To remove the hook set this to NULL.




MUIA_NListtree_DisplayHook -- [IS.],

   SPECIAL VALUES


   FUNCTION

    You have to supply a display hook to specify what should be shown in
    the listview, otherwise only the name of the nodes is displayed.

    The display hook will be called with the hook in A0, the object in
    A2 and a MUIP_NListtree_DisplayMessage struct in A1 (see nlisttree_mcc.h).

    The structure holds a pointer to a string array containing as many
    entries as your listtree may have columns. You have to fill this
    array with the strings you want to display. Check out that the array
    pointer of the tree column is set to NULL, if the normal name of the
    node should appear.
    You can set a preparse string in Preparse for the corresponding col
    element. Using it you'll be able to avoid copying the string in a
    buffer to add something in the beginning of the col string.

    The display hook also gets the position of the current entry as
    additional parameter. It is stored in the longword preceding the col
    array (don't forget it's a LONG).

    You can set the array pointer of the tree column to a string, which is
    diplayed instead of the node name. You can use this to mark nodes.

    See MUIA_NList_Format for details about column handling.

   FUNCTION

    A doubleclick opens a node if it was closed, it is closed if the node
    was open. You have to set the column which should do this.

    Normally only the column number is set here, but there are special
    values:

        MUIV_NListtree_DoubleClick_Off:
            A doubleclick is not handled.

        MUIV_NListtree_DoubleClick_All:
            All columns react on doubleclick.

        MUIV_NListtree_DoubleClick_Tree
            Only a doubleclick on the defined tree column is recognized.

        MUIV_NListtree_DoubleClick_NoTrigger:
            A doubleclick is not handled and not triggered!

    The TriggerValue of the notification is the tree node you have double-
    clicked, you can GetAttr() MUIA_NListtree_DoubleClick for the column
    number. The struct 'MUI_NListtree_TreeNode *'is used for trigger.

    The notification is done on leaves and on node columns, which are not
    set in MUIA_NListtree_DoubleClick.

MUIM_NListtree_NextSelected -- Get next selected tree node. (V1)

   SYNOPSIS

    DoMethod(obj, MUIM_NListtree_NextSelected,
        struct MUI_NListtree_TreeNode **treenode);


   FUNCTION

    Iterate through the selected entries of a tree. This method steps
    through the contents of a (multi select) list tree and returns
    every entry that is currently selected. When no entry is selected
    but an entry is active, only the active entry will be returned.

    This behaviour will result in not returning the active entry when
    you have some other selected entries somewhere in your list. Since
    the active entry just acts as some kind of cursor mark, this seems
    to be the only sensible possibility to handle multi selection
    together with keyboard control.


   INPUTS

    treenode -  A pointer to a pointer of struct MUI_NListtree_TreeNode
                that will hold the returned entry. Must be set to
                MUIV_NListtree_NextSelected_Start at start of iteration
                and is set to MUIV_NListtree_NextSelected_End when
                iteration is finished.

        MUIV_NListtree_NextSelected_Start    Set this to start iteration.
        MUIV_NListtree_NextSelected_End        Will be set to this, if
                                            last selected entry reached.

    steps through the contents of a (multi select) list tree and returns
    every entry that is currently selected. When no entry is selected
    but an entry is active, only the active entry will be returned.

    This behaviour will result in not returning the active entry when
    you have some other selected entries somewhere in your list. Since
    the active entry just acts as some kind of cursor mark, this seems
    to be the only sensible possibility to handle multi selection
    together with keyboard control.


   INPUTS

    treenode -  A pointer to a pointer of struct MUI_NListtree_TreeNode
                that will hold the returned entry. Must be set to
                MUIV_NListtree_PrevSelected_Start at start of iteration
                an the end and is set to MUIV_NListtree_PrevSelected_End
                when first selected entry is reached and iteration is
                finished.

        MUIV_NListtree_PrevSelected_Start    Set this to start iteration.
        MUIV_NListtree_PrevSelected_End        Will be set to this, if
                                            last selected entry reached.


   RESULT

   EXAMPLE

    // Iterate through a list (reverse)
    struct MUI_NListtree_TreeNode *treenode;

    treenode = MUIV_NListtree_PrevSelected_Start;

    for (;;)
    {
        DoMethod(listtree, MUIM_NListtree_PrevSelected, &amp;treenode);

        LONG selflags, LONG *state);


   FUNCTION

    Select or unselect a tree entry or ask an entry about its state.
    See special values for completeness.


   INPUTS

    treenode -    The tree node to be selected/unselected/asked.

        MUIV_NListtree_Select_Active    For the active entry.
        MUIV_NListtree_Select_All        For all entries.
        MUIV_NListtree_Select_Visible    For all visible entries.

    seltype -    Type of selection/unselection/ask

        MUIV_NListtree_Select_On        Select entry.
        MUIV_NListtree_Select_Toggle    Toggle entries state.
        MUIV_NListtree_Select_Ask        Just ask about the state.

    selflags -    Some kind of specials.

        MUIV_NListtree_Select_Flag_Force
            Adding this flag to seltype forces the selection by
            bypassing the multi test hook.

    state -        Pointer to a longword. If not NULL, it will be filled
                with the current selection state of the entry.


   RESULT

   EXAMPLE

        // Select the active entry.
        LONG retstate;

        DoMethod(obj, MUIM_NListtree_Select,
            MUIV_NListtree_Select_Active, MUIV_NListtree_Select_On,
            0, &amp;retstate);

        // We must check this, because the multi test hook may
        // cancel our selection.
        if (retstate == MUIV_NListtree_Select_On) {
            ...
        }


   NOTES

    If ( treenode == MUIV_NListtree_Select_All ) and
    ( seltype == MUIV_NListtree_Select_Ask ), state will be filled
    with the total number of selected entries.

    NEW for final 18.6:
    If (treenode == MUIV_NListtree_Select_Active ) and
    ( seltype == MUIV_NListtree_Select_Ask ), state will be the
    active entry, if any, or NULL.

    If only the active entry is selected, has a cursor mark (see
    MUIM_NListtree_NextSelected for that), you will receive 0 as
    the number of selected entries.

That MCC public custom class give scrollers for a NList public custom class to make NList/NListview work near the same way as List/Listview. Most things that were handled by Listview are now handled by NList, so NListview is quite simple, anyway it's very easier to use NList with NListview than without.

Anyway, use NList without NListview if you don't want to get attached scrollers (or want to attach your own scrollers to NList - see Demo). 

Note: NListview class can't use List as child but only NList, NFloattext, or a NList subclass, and NList class will not work with Listview without some conflict.


MUIA_NListview_Horiz_ScrollBar -- [ISG], Object *

    SPECIAL INPUTS
        MUIV_NListview_HSB_Always      1
        MUIV_NListview_HSB_Auto        2
        MUIV_NListview_HSB_FullAuto    3
        MUIV_NListview_HSB_None        4
        MUIV_NListview_HSB_Default     5

    SPECIAL SPECIAL INPUTS
        MUIV_NListview_HSB_On          0x0300
        MUIV_NListview_HSB_Off         0x0100

    FUNCTION
        With it you can tell if you want the scrollbar to be here
        always, never, automatic (not at start and appear forever if
        needed) or full automatic (appear and disappear when needed).

        Never is interesting if you want only one scrollbar of both
        or if you want to attach your own one only for one scrollbar.

        With Auto and FullAuto modes, scrollbars will not appear at
        first draw of the window. If you want it to appear when the
        window will be opened, you can set after creation time (not
        at init) MUIA_NListview_Horiz_ScrollBar
        to (MUIV_NListview_HSB_XXX|MUIV_NListview_HSB_On) where XXX
        is Default, FullAuto ...

        MUIV_NListview_HSB_On, MUIV_NListview_HSB_Off are used by the
        NList object to make scrollbars appear/disappear.

        The default is set by prefs. When prefs have not been set
        it is MUIV_NListview_HSB_Auto.



MUIA_NListview_HSB_Height -- [..G], LONG

    FUNCTION
        Return the height of the horizontal scrollbar.

        Return 0 when no horizontal scrollbar is visible.



MUIA_NListview_NList -- [I.G], Object *

    FUNCTION
        Same function as Listview.mui/MUIA_Listview_List.

        Every NListview needs a NList (or subclass) object as child.
        You should specify it here.

        If you don't specify one, NListview will create a NList object
        as child, giving it the same taglist as itself.
        It's the only case where NList tags given to NListview will be
        taken into account.

        As every other child, it will get disposes when its parent object is disposed.



MUIA_NListview_Vert_ScrollBar -- [ISG], Object *

    SPECIAL INPUTS
        MUIV_NListview_VSB_Always      1
        MUIV_NListview_VSB_Auto        2
        MUIV_NListview_VSB_FullAuto    3

        MUIV_NListview_VSB_Off         0x0010

    FUNCTION
        Same as MUIA_NListview_Horiz_ScrollBar but for vertical
        scrollbar.

        The default is set by prefs. When prefs have not been set
        it is MUIV_NListview_VSB_Always.



MUIA_NListview_VSB_Width -- [..G], LONG

    FUNCTION
        Return the width of the vertical scrollbar.

        Return 0 when no vertical scrollbar is visible.

NFloattext.mcc/MUIM_NFloattext_GetEntry
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;

NFloattext class is a subclass of NList class that takes a big text string as input and splits it up into several lines to be dislayed. Formatting capabilities include paragraphs an justified text with word wrap. That MCC public custom class  work near the same way as Floattext.

All you can do with NFloattext can be done directly using NList and its word wrap capabilities. NFloattext is here to give easy use and transition from Floattext.

Now NList package provide a Floattext.mui replacement which use directly this class. Unfortunately the replacement Floattext.mui have to have the same major release number than original Floattext.mui to be accepted by MUI, so it will have to be update with each new MUI release. 

By default, MUIA_NList_Input is FALSE and MUIA_NList_TypeSelect is MUIV_NList_TypeSelect_Char, alowing char selection and copy to clipboard. If you set MUIA_NList_Input to TRUE, then MUIA_NList_TypeSelect default to MUIV_NList_TypeSelect_Line as usual. 

NFloattext does not copy the string text, so it needs to copy the string line to a buffer when you do a MUIM_NFloattext_GetEntry or MUIM_List_GetEntry, so the return pointer will be invalid after next GetEntry call (the new one will be valid of course). 

Using the old MUIA_Floattext_Text from standard Floatext class instead of MUIA_NFloattext_Text will make NFloattext copy the text like in Floattext class.

Note that MUIM_NList_GetEntry work as describe in NList, so as NFloattext use word wrap entries, you should use better MUIM_NFloattext_GetEntry or MUIM_List_GetEntry. Or use MUIM_NList_GetEntryInfo and MUIM_NList_GetEntry.



MUIA_NFloattext_Align -- [ISG], LONG

    SPECIAL INPUTS
        ALIGN_LEFT
        ALIGN_CENTER
        ALIGN_RIGHT
        ALIGN_JUSTIFY

    FUNCTION
        Indicate what alignment you want.
        It can be done with an escape alignment sequence
        in the Format preparse string or in the text string
        (for each linefeed separated lines) itself.

        setting it will set MUIA_NFloattext_Justify to
        TRUE if ALIGN_JUSTIFY, else to FALSE.



MUIA_NFloattext_Justify -- [ISG], BOOL

    FUNCTION
        Same as Floattext.mui/MUIA_Floattext_Justify.

        if TRUE, MUIA_NFloattext_Align will be set to
        ALIGN_JUSTIFY, else to ALIGN_LEFT.



MUIA_NFloattext_SkipChars -- [ISG], char *

    FUNCTION
        Same as NList.mcc/MUIA_NList_SkipChars
        and Floattext.mui/MUIA_Floattext_SkipChars.




MUIA_NFloattext_TabSize -- [ISG], LONG

    FUNCTION
        Same as NList.mcc/MUIA_NList_TabSize
        and Floattext.mui/MUIA_Floattext_TabSize.

        Tab size defaults to 8.




MUIA_NFloattext_Text -- [ISG], STRPTR

    FUNCTION
        Same as Floattext.mui/MUIA_Floattext_Text.

        String of characters to be displayed as floattext.
        This string may contain linefeeds or carriage retruns to mark
        the end of paragraphs or tab characters for indention.

        NFloattext will automatically format the text according
        to the width of the NFloattext object. If a word
        won't fit into the current line, it will be wrapped.

        NFloattext don't copies the string into a private buffer
        as Floattext do it, so you need to keep your text in
        memory, but it uses less memory.

        If you want NFloattext to copy the text, just use
        MUIA_Floattext_Text which will do it for compatibility.

        Setting MUIA_NFloattext_Text to NULL means to clear
        the current text.

        Please note that justification and word wrap is a
        complicated operation and may take a considerable
        amount of time, especially with long texts on slow
        machines.





MUIM_NFloattext_GetEntry --

    SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj,MUIM_NFloattext_GetEntry,LONG pos, APTR *entry);

    FUNCTION
        Same function as List.mui/MUIM_List_GetEntry.

        You'll get pointer to a null terminated string buffer which
        is a copy of the asked visible entry.

        Unlike with Floattext, the returned string will be valid only
        until next MUIM_NFloattext_GetEntry/MUIM_List_GetEntry call
        if the entry was word wrapped.
        I'll try to make it stay valid when using MUIM_List_GetEntry
        only if someone report me some compatibility problem because
        doing that will use more memory.

&lt;/pre&gt;




===NBalance===

&lt;pre&gt;
NBalance.mcc/NBalance.mcc
NBalance.mcc/MUIA_NBalance_Pointer
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
This MCC public custom class is derived from the MUI standard balance class which handles the dragging/resizing of vertical and horizontal groups.

In contrast to the standard MUI balance class, however, it adds some features such as displaying a mouse pointer as soon as the mouse is above a dragable NBalance object.



MUIA_NBalance_Pointer -- [ISG.], LONG

    INPUTS
        MUIV_NBalance_Pointer_Off
        MUIV_NBalance_Pointer_Standard (default)

    FUNCTION
        Allows to set the mouse pointer that should be displayed when
        the mouse is found to be above a NBalance object. Per default
        a standard horizontal or vertical size pointer is displayed as
        soon as the mouse is above a dragable NBalance object.
&lt;/pre&gt;




===NBitmap===





==Creating a custom class==

Most likely when creating a custom class you will want to extend the existing classes functionality, like providing a new appearance, handling keys, etc. Zune provides an interface to do so. The newly created class can be &quot;private&quot; to your application, or &quot;public&quot; and thus available to other applications like any existing (built-in or public custom) class.

To create you own custom class...

available on Aminet - look for DisKo 

If you want to make your new custom class publicly available, e. g. to be included in AROS, it is necessary to register a class base address / class ID - to avoid conflicts with other developers developing a public custom class.

Most of my wiki-work contributes to the [[:w:sv:Portal:Huvudsida|Swedish Wikipedia]], where I maintain the same user name as here; [[:w:sv:User:Tommy_Kronkvist|Tommy Kronkvist]]. Swedish is my mothertongue – even though I was born and went to school for one year in Jakobstad, Finland – but I feel fairly comfortable speaking and writing English (and some German) as well. Odd as it may seem, I can't speak any Finnish. Sad, but true&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp;:-)

My family name consists of two parts: &quot;''Kron''&quot; – a short form of the Swedish word &quot;''krona''&quot; meaning 'crown', as in coronation crown or tree crown – and &quot;''kvist''&quot;, meaning 'bough' or 'twig'. Hence the name ''Kronkvist'' refers to a twig in the canopy of a forest, closest to the sun. I'm the fourth generation of Kronkvist's. Before that our family name used to be ''Mattus'' – living in Oravais, Finland, while still speaking Swedish – dating back from late 1637. Today I live in Uppsala, the fourth biggest city in Sweden.

=== &lt;span style=&quot;color: #008080&quot;&gt;The Bernoulli Distribution&lt;/span&gt;  ===

A Bernoulli trial is a chance event that can have one of two outcomes, usually called &quot;success&quot; or &quot;failure.&quot; 

This distribution has one parameter, the unobserved probability of success, p. The probability of failure, often designated q, is the complement of p: 1-p 

Some Bernoulli trials: 

*Tossing a coin (Heads = success = 1, Tails = failure = 0) 
*A single oocyst is detected with probability R and not detected with probability 1-R, R = recovery 
*A marksman using a certain weapon aims at a target of a certain size that is a certain distance away. Each time he fires, he can either hit or miss the target. 
*Walking Betty, we encounter a jogger. Betty either lunges, barking viciously, or totally ignores the jogger. (In this case, a lunge would be considered a &quot;failure.&quot;) 
*Your PARS evaluation results either in &quot;fully successful&quot; or something else. Do you think of fully successful a &quot;success&quot; or &quot;failure?&quot; 
*Mike has written a number on a piece of paper. Your computer will generate one realization of a standard uniform random variable. It &quot;succeeds&quot; if the random number is less than Mike's. It is best to establish your prior before obtaining any data. Consider: 
**How likely is it that Mike would pick a number less than zero, making the success probability 0? 
**How likely is it that Mike would pick a number greater than one, making the success probability 1? 
**Between 0 and 1, are there special values? Is 1/2 special? 1? 0? Others? 
**A good prior might be Pr{0} = 1/3, Pr{1} = 1/3, with remaining 1/3 weight evenly spread across the range [0,1]

**''(Correction) What hit rate (p) is so small that data as extreme as what was observed would occur with at most probability 0.05? Answer: If datum is &quot;success,&quot; a hit rate of 0.05 or less would produce &quot;success&quot; with at most probability 0.05 (duh). If datum is &quot;failure,&quot; then a hit rate of 0.95 or greater would produce &quot;failur&quot; with at most probability 0.05.''

*&lt;font color=&quot;#800000&quot;&gt;hist(rbinom(1000,10,0.5), breaks = seq(from=-0.5, to=12.5))&lt;/font&gt; will put integer values at bar centers (rather than at bar-right.

==== &lt;span style=&quot;color: #008080&quot;&gt;Parameter Estimation &lt;/span&gt; ====

Most of the time, we get to count the number of trials, so that parameter (N) is known. We observe the number of positives (K) and use this information to estimate the unobserved &quot;success&quot; probability (P). 

*Sum of M binomials is same as sum of M*N Bernoulli Trials = binom(M*N,P) 
*Maximum Likelihood 
**lambda = sum(successes)/sum(trials) = sum(K)/sum(N)
*Bayesian 
**With uniform prior, posterior is [[Beta|Beta]](alpha=1+sum(K), beta=1+sum(N)-sum(K)) 
**With prior probability mass on 0 and 1 and the remaining mass given to Beta(1,1), see [[Coin tossing|coin tossing example.]]

&lt;br&gt;

*Classical 
**Normal Approximation 
**Exact Confidence Interval

&lt;font color=&quot;#800080&quot;&gt;BUT, what if the number of trials is not known for M binomial trials? Can we used the data K[1] through K[M] to estimate both N and P?&lt;/font&gt;

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French Cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Soup|Soup]]

French [[Cookbook:Onion Soup|onion soup]] is a classic French soup. It's lightly bound with a little flour. 

==Ingredients==
* 4 large [[Cookbook:onion|onions]]
* 1 liter of beef [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]] (use home made onion stock to make a vegetarian soup)
* 1 tbsp of [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
* [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* [[Cookbook:Garlic croutons|Croutons]], about four slices of bread worth (optional)

==Procedure==

# Slice the onions into rings and [[Cookbook:sauté|sauté]] them gently in the butter (don't use olive oil for this). Don't rush this, let the onions brown very gently.
#:During this step, you may see a brown substance known as [[Cookbook:fond|fond]] at the bottom of the pan. Later, you'll use a technique known as [[Cookbook:deglazing|deglazing]] to round off the taste of the soup.
# Add the flour and stir. The flour will seem to have disappeared, but has been absorbed into the butter. This will give the soup its characteristic slight thickness.
# Add a quarter of the stock and stir for a while. Add another quarter of the stock and keep stirring. Repeat for the remaining stock.

The soup is best served with [[Cookbook:Garlic croutons|croutons]] floating in it.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* Onion soup is often eaten with grated cheese ([[Cookbook:Gruyère Cheese|Gruyère]], classically). It can be sprinkled over oven-baked croutons or sprinkled over the soup when the croutons are already baked.
* You may find it useful to substitute a [[Cookbook:wok|wok]] for a frying pan, as the higher sides make it easier to avoid spilling the soup after adding the stock.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==About Us==

Greetings to all circuit enthusiasts, dreamers and people who don't know anything about electrical engineering and stuff. If you are the 3d type, don't bother, because, as a disciples of Mr.Mechkov (aka &quot;circuit fantasist&quot;, aka the initiator of this page) we have learned that complex mathematics, formulas and confusing diagrams just make things worse (if that's even possible). So, what we are going to do is put our &quot;learned&quot; experience through the course in simple pictures with basic and logical explanations, with fewer numbers as possible.

cheers:the 57gr. team&lt;!--Thanks! ~~~~--&gt;

==Lab 1 Building LED Voltage Indicator using transistor switches  ==

===Whiteboard===
Today's task,although may seem simple at first glance contains some interesting and cunning techniques  about integrating digital and analogue circuit ideas together.
The basic idea of the indicator is illustrated in this simple diagram below.
[[Image:Diagramlab1.jpg|thumb||right|alt=Basic Diagram|Basic Diagram]][[Image:Currentstaringdiagram.jpg|thumb||left|alt=Current Steering|Current Steering]][[Image:Ex1sch1.jpg|thumb||left|alt=Power Block|Power Block]]
We start out with building bipolar power supply consisting two 12V sources(which we'll also use in the further projects)  .We add the two resistors having in mind the semiconductor properties of each LED,depending it's colour(green-2,1-2,2V;red 1,6-1,7V operating voltage).
The next step will be to find effective,yet simple way to switch the current with ease between the LED branches.Here comes in handy an idea from the ECL circuits,knows as '''current steering'''.The current steering idea using simple switches,as shown on the white board is in the photo on the left.

The whole power block,including the LED's V-A characteristics and the ECL current steering principle is shown afterward.

The next step is to replace this simple switches with a bipolar transistors.For our needs they should be different types,one PNP and one NPN.Then we connect the transistors bases to each other and than to the input signal-thus the one will operate on the negative side of the signal(PNP) and the other,on the positive(NPN).For input we'll use a variable resistor.The middle point on the potentiometer is appearing to be 0 V,so it's called '''virtual ground'''.Our circuit is also going to be complementary-consist of two opposite parts-negative and positive.When risen to levels above 0,6-0,7V the input voltage activates one of the BJTs(depending on the polarity) and there is current flowing through the collector-emitter junction.This activates  the corresponding LED and makes the green go off because it's voltage has fallen to 1,7V.

Our next task will be to properly position the transistors and the two red LEDs.After trying different configurations we managed to discover the optimal way-shown on the whiteboard drawing of the final circuit.When there is absence of signal in the input of the BJT the green LED is on,receiving current from the voltage source and the two resistors.When risen to levels above 0,6-0,7V the input voltage activates one of the BJTs(depending on the polarity) and there is current flowing through the collector-emitter junction.This activates  the corresponding LED and makes the green go off because it's voltage has fallen to 1,7V.
[[Image:Ex1sch4.jpg|thumb||right|alt=Final Circuit|Final Circuit]]
In the two different scenarios one of the transistors connects one of the red diods parallel to the green one,while shortens the other red.Other benefit of this simple,but powerful method is the big tolerance of output and input voltages.It's also very flexible,because the zero indicator(the green LED) can be transformed to indicate different voltage levels just by adjusting the restricting resistors(R1,R2).

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

===Building the circuit===
After understanding the final idea and structure of the circuit it's time to do it with real elements on the PCB.

==Lab 2 Investigating the common emitter BJT topology==

Well,that's maybe one of the most familiar ways of connecting a BJT,known for its voltage amplifying capabilities.Today we'll take a deeper look in this famous circuit and investigate it's properties in practice.In fact the term 'amplifying' is a bit misleading,knowing the nature of the energy,so a more accurate way is to describe the process as 'regulating' energy.When we place such 'regulating' device,such as a transistor in the way of constant energy source it acts like a resistance which absorbs and converts energy in a way that makes this source no more constant but controlled.So we can refer to such devices as 'electric regulated resistors'.

We'll start with building the simplest circuit with n-p-n BJT transistor.The emitter will be tied to the ground and the base will act like a controlling input.We than can derive from this all the static characteristics and so on.For practical investigation we'll try to connect the BJT to a bipolar power supply.By doing this we again will observe the phenomenon 'virtual ground' in the middle.This resembles the so called 'push-pull output',but using just one transistor.As you can see in the pictures we used the DACs input for source and got some trouble following the base current route.

==Lab 3 Investigating the common collector topology(aka emitter follower)==

As we try to  figure out the application of this rather odd looking circuit(to some it may look like the emitter is common,but in fact the collector is tied to the power supply rail) we stumble upon the idea of active repeating.To achieve a simple repeating of a voltage(or following) we may try to use a simple conducting wire.But soon we'll realize that this is not an option,because part of the voltage is lost due to the inner resistance of the conductor.So we'll have to find a different way of doing this.Luckily Mr.Mechkov has some inspiring examples in real life to share with us.Such examples we see everyday-in the driver controlling the cars speed,to the voice changing depending the surroundings.All examples we can think of have something in common-that's the active following.This is illustrated in the block diagram.Analyzing it we see that this is the principle of the negative feedback.In our case the comparing  device will be played by the base-emitter junction and the regulating device will be the collector-emitter.The transistor will be than comparing the output emitter voltage with the input and matching both to be equal.

==Lab 4 Op-amp fundamentals,voltage follower and it's usage in Gyrator circuit==
The op-amp(short for operational amplifier)is a key element of many useful circuits.As we all know,it possesses great amplifying capabilities-reaching easily 200 000 or more amp ratio.Have said that we can describe it's function as based on 'redundancy'.One of our tasks today will be to take this enormous ratio and scale it down to just 1(follower).This task may seem useless at first,as it was thought when the famous Harold Black made his discovery(the negative feedback),which later made a huge impact on modern engineering.

Lets begin our basic understanding of the op-amp.We see that it has two inputs-inverting and non-inverting.The two types are used depending our purpose-using negative or positive feedback.In addition to that we have also dual polar power supply.If we connect two 12V batteries and a load to make the picture complete we get the similar symmetric circuit we encountered before.It resembles a bridge circuit.The next step will be to finish the circuit with connecting two batteries to the differential inputs.The final variant can be seen on the picture bellow,illustrating both input and output voltages.The op-amp has very sensitive inputs,thus a very little change between them results saturation in the output.

[[Image:Opampbasic.jpg|thumb||left|alt=The Op-amp|The Op-amp]][[Image:compensatingopamp.jpg|thumb||right|alt=Voltage follower using negative feedback|Voltage follower using negative feedback ]][[Image:Gyratorinitial.jpg|thumb||left|alt=The Initial ideas behind the gyrator and voltage and current diagrams|Initial ideas behind the gyrator and voltage and current diagrams]][[Image:Finalgyrator.jpg|thumb||right|alt=The final gyrator circuit|The final gyrator circuit]]
For our next task we have to build active voltage follower and use it in some effective way.We start with building a simple voltage divider.If we connect a voltmeter in the output we notice that the desired voltage is lower than expected due the voltmeters inner resistance.The whole circuit acts like an actual voltage source.In order to make this ideal we need to compensate via 100% negative feedback.In the previous labs this role in the compensation method was played by a transistor.It was both acting like a comparing and regulating device.Now we'll replace it with an op-amp.The final circuit can be seen on the right.

Now lets shift to our next task-the interesting concept of the gyrator.By definition the gyrator is used to transform a load capacitance into an inductance.This is very useful because the bulky coils can be replaced by smaller assembly containing a capacitor, operational amplifiers or transistors, and resistors.We'll start from scratch with building a simple RC and RL circuits and analyzing the two diagrams representing the change of the voltages and currents of both C and L in the time domain.We notice that the voltage drop on the resistor in the RC circuit represents the voltage drop of the inductive element in the other circuit.After discovering this dependence we'll have to find a way to implement it.

We start of with building a RC circuit.To to copy the voltage drop on the resistor which simulates the inductive element we use another power source as shown on the picture.Next we must find a way to copy the current which flows through the capacitor.For this purpose we focus on the other branch and connect a resistor Rl.The voltage drop on it is equivalent of the drop on the capacitor.The desired current is equal to Vc/Rl.Now the sketch appears again to resemble a familiar thing-balanced bridge. Next step will be to integrate the voltage follower we discussed above into the circuit.Now the combination of the op-amp and the resistor Rl behaves like inductive element.

We didn't have time left for real implementation on the PCB,but instead we came to an interesting discussion about the existence of positive feedback loop in the circuit below.In fact such definitely exist and to be stable the ratio of this feedback must be smaller than 1.

==Lab 5 Building inverting and non-inverting amplifiers with op-amp==

After building the voltage follower in the previous lab,now is time to rise the amplifying constant to, lets say 10.By 10 we mean strictly 10,without noticeable bias.For understanding the principle we discussed some real life examples which involve such mechanisms(like the car driver and the accelerator pedal).We came to the fact that in the process of overcoming some kind of disturbance or obstacle the follower becomes an amplifier.So our purpose now is to place such constant obstacle from the output to the input of our comparing device.At first we try to use just a simple resistor but it won't work because there wouldn't be any voltage drop on it due the high input impedance of the op-amp.So we'll use another well known circuit-the voltage divider.So we choose the resistors to be equal and managing ratio of 0,5.In this interesting way we actually built an amplifier by attenuation and pick for output the reaction to that attenuation.

For inventing the inverting amplifier we'll travel back in time in the year when Harold Black stumbled to the same problem.He didn't have any op-amp with differential inputs by his side.So we'll single input device.Following the circuit bellow we try to find a way to sum the voltages of the two batteries.We cannot sum them in serial,but summing them parallel will cause issues,so we will connect two resistors to soften the conflict.This way of connecting them illustrated well the principle of superposition and actually we made a summer with weight factors(electric scales).After we got this summer we'll connect the output to the op-amps inverting input.In case we use op-amp with differential inputs we'll connect the non-inverting input to ground.To make our summer the input and output voltages must be with different poles.So we invert the output voltage and than receive an inverter.  To make it amplify we rise the resistance R2 to be bigger than R1 very much like a pair of scales.If the proportion is opposite we'll get an inverting attenuator.We also see that the inverting input of the op-amp appears to be '0' or the so called 'virtual ground',and we see that the potential diagram 'oscillates' around this point.Another benefit of the circuit is that it consumes energy from the power source,not from the input.

      <comment>/* Why Should I learn Malay? */ corrected typo error</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Malay is an Austronesian language. It is spoken in southeastern Asia in Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei, Thailand and the Philippines. It is fairly simple compared to other Asian languages, as it uses the Latin script. It is similar to Indonesian in pronunciation and shares some words such as &quot;Halo&quot; with this language. The creators of this book hope you enjoy it and use it as a source for your studies, whether it is primary or secondary.

===Why Should I learn Malay?===
Learning Malay can not only be a fun thing to do, but you could then also communicate with Malay speaking people in the countries mentioned above. It would also be a great opportunity to visit a Malay speaking country, or just learn a little more about Malaysian culture and life style. You could learn simple phrases to use while traveling or if you plan on moving to Malaysia, it would help you out with not knowing the area and be able to communicate with people if you need help.

===How this book is Designed===

This book is designed to help you in your studies of Malay. It is divided into sections with Introduction, Alphabet, Pronunciation, Vowels, Consonants, Basics, Beginner Level, Intermediate Level, Advanced Level, Quick Phrases and other useful links. We hope you enjoy this book, and please take time to explore more about the Malay culture, as it is very unique. One good place to do so is on Wikipedia and you can also research other websites online for information about the Malay language and Malaysia.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Haec est fabula De Faciebus Iani. Ianus, ut dicebatur, erat unus deorum, cui facies duae erant. Altera earum enim in futura et altera in praeterita prospiciebat.

Apollo ei olim sic dixit: &quot;Nonne tibi facies est, qua tempus praesens spectes?&quot; Et paulo post Ianus ita respondit:

&quot;Mundus - orbis terrarum cyclus est similiter ac tempus est cyclicum. Et initium omnium et finem video. Omnia prospicio aeternusque sum, neque opus est porro videre, quae palam iaceant.&quot;

Diu cogitavit Apollo de verbis Iani hominesque acutissimā mente in omni orbe terrarum conquaesivit eo consilio, ut ipse tam sapiens ut Ianus fieret. Postea cum quibusdam illustrissimis viris collocutus est, quo sapientior esset. Eo facto tamen unus eorum, cui Minervus nomen, Apollinem monuit, ne summam quaereret sapientiam, quam novisse nullum alium quam Ianum oportebat. Revenit autem Apollo ad Ianum eumque, ut veritatem cognosceret, ea summa rogavit.

&quot;Intellegisne omnino quid roges?&quot; inquit Ianus, &quot;Si dis par fueris, omnibus iuribus privari possis.&quot;

Itaque Apollo cognovit sapientissimum omnium fuisse, a quo monitus est.


Translation below:









































This is the story of the faces of Janus. Janus, as it used to be said, was one of the gods who had two faces. It was that one spied into the future while the other into the past.

Apollo once had said to him, &quot;Have you not a face with which to see the present?&quot; After a few moments, thus spoke Ianus:

&quot;The world is a circle. Time is a circle. I see both the beginning and end of all living things. I am foreseeing and eternal; therefore, it is not necessary for me to see that which is lying out of sight.&quot;

Apollo thought about these words for a very long time, and thus, that he might become wise like Janus, he sought the keenest minds of the land. He then was speaking with some great men that he might become wiser. However, one, whose name was Minervus, warned him not to seek the ultimate/highest truth because it may only be known by Janus. But he returned again to ask Janus that he might obtain the truth.

&quot;Do you even know for what you're asking? If you enter onto the same level (of the Gods), all your rights might be snatched from you,&quot; said Janus.

And so Apollo knows now that the same man who had warned him was the wisest of all.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;
== Hawking Radiation ==
&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
Hawking radiation is a theoretical effect produced by black holes. The idea was first put forward in 1972 by Jacob Bekenstein, a research student at Princeton, and improved upon by Stephen Hawking in 1974. Hawking's theory predicted that black holes should eventually decay or “evaporate” over time.  This evaporation is based on the idea of thermal radiation with a black body radiation spectrum corrected for quantum effects coupled with the idea of vacuum energy.

	Vacuum energy is the theoretical energy present in space, even in the absence of matter-energy.  The theory postulates that empty space fluctuates and generates pairs of virtual particles of matter or energy.  One particle is matter, the other antimatter. No sooner are they generated than they annihilate each other, thus keeping from violating the law of conservation of matter and energy.

	Hawking’s theory postulates a particle pair generated from vacuum energy straddling horizon of a black hole, with one particle inside the horizon and its counterpart just outside the horizon. Then it would be possible for the large gravity of the black hole [[Image:BlackHole.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's representation of a black hole]] to pull the two particle apart before they could annihilate each other and thus change the two from virtual particles to real particles.  If then one of particles escaped while the other was pulled into the black hole, to the outside observer the black hole will have radiated a particle.  This means that the black hole has lost some of its energy, and since we live in Einstein’s universe where matter and energy are combined to make matter-energy, the loss of some of its energy means that it is less massive than it was before it emitted the particle.

	Now, if you are worried that the universe is in danger of losing its black hole population - don’t be.  Hawking radiation only has a noticeable effect on black holes of around 10^12 kg &lt;ref name = &quot;four&quot;&gt;C. Peters, Joseph Silk, Sadegh Khochfar, Joseph Silk. AccessScience. 16 March 2010 &lt;http://www.accessscience.com/content.aspx?searchStr=hawking+radiation&amp;id=085900&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. or smaller.  This is because a black hole must be starved to death; that is, the matter-energy it emits must be greater than the matter-energy it takes in.  Since a black hole's mass is inversely proportional to its temperature, and the amount of matter-energy that it radiates is dependent on its temperature, then as the mass of the black hole increases, the amount of matter-energy that it emits decreases. So for larger black holes such as one about the mass of our sun, their temperature is very low (about 10^-7 K) so they have very low radiation.  And since they receive light from stars, cosmic background radiation, and even matter in the form of dust, planets and stars, they continue to grow. It will only be at some future date when all stars have gone out, matter is out of reach of large black holes, and the temperature of the universe is less than that of the black hole itself, that the larger black holes will begin to evaporate.

	Now that I have given you a brief overview of Hawking radiation and what it means, we can begin to delve deeper into what it is, how it works, and what its implications are.

Firstly, let’s refer back to vacuum energy.  According to quantum field theory, all fields must be quantized at each and every point in space.  Since a “vacuum” can be a space in which all energies cancel, you can make calculations of quantum field theory based on this model.  You can model an expectation value for vacuum energy.  The lowest possible energy for a quantized simple harmonic oscillator is E=1/2 ℏω.  If you sum this energy over all points in space, you get an infinite quantity, thus giving rise to electron-positron creation and annihilation.  When these particles are created at an event horizon of a black hole and one is pulled into the black hole before the pair can annihilate, the resulting Hawking’s flux arises from one particle being cast off to infinity&lt;ref name = &quot;five&quot;&gt;Nielsen, Alex B. &quot;Black Holes without Boundaries.&quot; International Journal of Modern Physics D: Gravitation, Astrophysics &amp; Cosmology 17.13 (2008): 2359-66. 
&lt;/ref&gt;
 
If you look at a black hole in its simplest form - that of a non-rotating, non-charged Schwarzschild black hole of mass M - you can calculate the temperature of the perfect black body radiation emitted by the black hole using the Hawking's radiation temperature formula.
|&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\hbar c^3}{8 \pi G M k_B} \;&lt;/math&gt;
|

 This coupled with the Schwarzchild radius[[Image:BH LMC.png|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Simulated view of a black hole in front of the Large Magellanic Cloud. The ratio between the black hole Schwarzschild radius and the observer distance to it is 1:9. Of note is the gravitational lensing effect known as an Einstein ring, which produces a set of two fairly bright and large but highly distorted images of the Cloud as compared to its actual angular size.]]
:&lt;math&gt;r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2} \;&lt;/math&gt;

 and the Stefan-Boltzmann power law:
:&lt;math&gt;P = A_s j^{\star} = A_s \epsilon \sigma T^{4} \;&lt;/math&gt;

 allows you to derive the Stefan-Boltzmann-Schwarzschild-hawking power law:
:&lt;math&gt;P = A_s \epsilon \sigma T^4 = \left( \frac{16 \pi G^2 M^2}{c^4} \right) \left( \frac{\pi^2 k_B^4}{60 \hbar^3 c^2} \right) \left( \frac{\hbar c^3}{8 \pi G M k_B} \right)^4 = \frac{\hbar c^6}{15360 \pi G^2 M^2} \;&lt;/math&gt;

for black hole radiation. 

To put this in perspective, a black hole with one solar mass will have the small output of 9.003*10^-29 watts. From this we can calculate the time it would take for a black hole to evaporate in a completely empty universe.  Now we see why it takes so long for black holes to evaporate, since the time of evaporation is proportional to the cube of its mass.  However, this time is only theoretical because, in reality, the universe contains cosmic background radiation - among other things - so even a very isolated back hole would have to be smaller in mass than 0.8% of the earth to begin to evaporate.



Hawking’s radiation has many implications; one of them explains why scientists feel safe creating microscopic back holes.  A black hole that lasts for even a second would need to have a mass of 2.28*10^5 kg, and since they are colliding much smaller particles, the time that each black hole exists is micro-seconds, possibly nano-seconds.  This also means that as a black hole evaporates, unlike most objects, its temperature goes up (or as it grows, its temperature goes down). So in effect, perhaps some of the coldest things in the universe are the super massive black holes at the center of galaxies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a good chapter. It has well documented ideas, all linked together around a central topic. It is well organized, and it has several points it is trying to make throughout. On the improvement side, some of the sections are a bit uneven with respect to each other. The earlier sections are more thoroughly documented than the later sections. Also, the chapter in general could use more links to outside materials in the body of the chapter.

I really enjoyed the fundamental points in this chapter.  It was well organized and the main points were well supported with great examples.  One attribute that could have been mentioned, is the importance of emotional intelligence.  The power of empathy and truly trying to understand where others in the team are coming from.  This attribute builds synergy among team members and can help in removing barriers of conflict by exploiting the underlying causes.  It is also a form of respect and is an assertive tool.  Overall the organization and details that supported the main points made this chapter very good.

I really enjoyed the last part of this section.  The real world/work place examples and ways of implimenting them peaked my interest.  I feel that too often in collegiate texts that too much time, energy, and emphasis is put into theory and/or terminology rather than real world illustrations of real events.  I felt that this was too much theory without tying real world application into it.  I believe the two can coexist and be benificial.  For me, there was too many quotations.  I felt like it was overkill and was very distracting.  Paraphrasing in many cases would have emphasied the point.  By doing so you can more effectively include your experiences and knowledge to enhance understanding.  Let's be honest...who really cares who said what.  The point is what is being said.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a well done chapter. It includes good information on the general phenomenon of groupthink but it also goes further by including criticisms of the phenomenon. In other words, it does not simply document what is out there, but goes beyond to also include alternative explanations and points of view. It uses media extensively in the chapter, and it also has many hyper links to information in other sources. In terms of things to improve, the outlining is uneven across different sections, and in some sections bullet points are favored while in others paragraph form is more prevalent.



This chapter was very well organized.  It delivered the appropriate information in a succinct and clear manner.  I really enjoyed the content and especially the great examples.  I would suggest the use of more sources- the chapter overwhelmingly relies on one source.


I enjoyed this chapter. I have researched groupthink before myself and felt that the authors did a a good job of covering this issue.  I liked the question at the beginning &quot;what is groupthink and how can groups overcome it&quot; this was very clear and let the reader know exactly what the author is trying to accomplish with this chapter.  I liked the 5 ways to prevent groupthink, however I felt that a lot more could've been said in this section seeing how this is one of the main objectives the author was trying to accomplish with this chapter.  I felt that the Janis source used was credible and informative though it was very clear that Janis was the main source. Other sources weren't brought up untill the critique. I feel that less examples of groupthink should be used, maybe just 1 or 2, like for example 1 historic and 1 current.  I also liked the comparison made between groupthink and synergy, however i didn't think it should be talked about in the conclusion section.  The conclusion should sum up the article, perhaps breifly bring up some of the main problems that arise from groupthink and then say how groups can overcome those problems.  Overall it was well done.

This chapter was organized very well; it was very concise and well developed. It was also very readable. There is one complain that I have and that is proper spelling and grammar. For example the last name of Allen Dulles was spelled in lower case, and in the part of “criticism of Groupthink”, the following sentence was written as follows: “He also sites studies…” (it’s cites). Improper grammar and spelling might hurt your ethos as it might prompt the reader to lose confidence in you as the writer. All in all, I liked this chapter.

==Y2K==

I am dubious about the Y2K example. The argument seems to be: &quot;We spent all that money on prevention, and then nothing went seriously wrong. What a waste of money!&quot; This is like saying: &quot;We vaccinated everyone against measles, and hardly anyone gets it. What a waste of money!&quot; Or: &quot;We made seatbelts compulsory, and hardly anyone flies head-first through their windscreens. What an unjustifiable assault on civil liberties!&quot; But we cannot assess the merits of a program of prevention by counting up the things that it ''didn't'' prevent.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Solid. This chapter could use links to other sources (Wikipedia covers the details of many of the concepts used, for instance). It could use some images to illustrate some of the ideas. The presentation is uneven. In some places paragraphs have only one sentence, while in others it could benefit from being broken up a bit more.

----

This is a good start. There is alot of information, but in some areas it seems as though information is just thrown in, in no particular order. Bullets could help when there are a list, the methods for instance. It would break up the long paragraphs and present a better flowing article. Links in the text would be nice and quotes should list who said them in the text along with the references. It mentions several times experts who say this and that, who are these experts? It has alot of useful information, but doesn't seem to flow well and seems a bit disjointed.


This chapter had great information, however could have been a little bit more organized. Sub headings on some of your main points could have helped in organizing the content of the chapter. Also, bullets would have helped as well as visuals.  Furthermore, examples of how stereotyping can be managed could have been useful as well.</text>

I really enjoyed this topic.  I felt that the authors presented the material in a logical, linear matter that made it an easy read.  They set the table by defining cultural diversity and emphasized the importance in today’s business environment.  I liked how they spoke to both the advantages and disadvantages of diversified teams.  They outlined how to overcome and address challenge areas and ended with a well written section on CQ.  There was a little inconsistency in the format between sections and there were some minor grammatical errors.  Overall this was a good chapter. 
---

A well done piece. Nicely executed with figures and links. In terms of areas to improve, the references should be linked to the bottom of the page, and some (such as the links to wikipedia) should be added directly into the text. Also, the chapter needs to have a bit more consistency in the writing across sections.

------
Interesting topic, but this article needs some help. There are basic spelling/grammar and formatting issues that should be modified (for example AT@T, noun/pronoun agreement, CQ became CI toward the end, etc.) Tone is also an issue in this article. A general rule of thumb is that academic papers should be in the third person (no &quot;we&quot; and no &quot;you&quot;) to maintain a professional tone. Phrases like &quot;bad for business&quot; do not seem to belong in an academic paper. Also, quotes were not used correctly. Sentences that could have easily been paraphrased and then expanded upon were directly quoted, giving the article a sort of &quot;cut-and-paste&quot; feeling.

The article did not really address the juxtaposition of international versus diversified. Do those two things necessarily mean the same thing?

Overall, I think that this is a fairly good article. The author(s) obviously have a good grasp on many OB topics and these concepts are integrated throughout. However, the article definitely needs some help as far as writing goes.  
------

I found the article to be informative.  The only drawback may be the length.  I agree with the above statement that the book could be broken up with some visuals.  Another possible suggestion would be to highlight one of the well recognized companies that was mentioned in the book by giving supporting statistics and company insight into how diversity helped their organization.
-------
:Regarding the question of &quot;tone&quot;, I think it is open to the author(s) to fit the style of presentation to the intended audience. Textbooks can be written for the general reader or even children. Wikibooks would hardly have policies [[WB:NOR|banning original research]] if it was intended for academic papers.

-------
The chapter was an interesting topic.  A few things I noticed were the basic gramatical/spelling errors.  Also, on the paragraph headings in bold, possibly make those a shorter statement and then go on to tell the scentence that you had before.  In a few parts there would be statements that would say &quot;the book also suggests...&quot; but there is no reference to what book you are talking about.  Finally I would try to make it flow a little bit better.  It sort of sounds like different people wrote the sections and then just pasted them together.  Other than that it was a good piece.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A great take on variety in teams, focusing on similarities instead of differences. Great idea. Explaining the advantages or disadvantages of having homogeneity and variety across the big five is good. In terms of areas to improve, the chapter includes images that have unclear licensing guidelines. Those need to be cleaned up to comply with Wikimedia standards. The chapter could also use uniform numbering systems across the sections.



Overall, this chapter is informative and interesting.  However, I did feel that several parts were redundant and repeated concepts too many times.  In addition, I noticed several seemingly irrelevant pieces of information were added.  The chapter is great as a whole, but could use concision.


I really liked the idea of maximizing group effectiveness by forming a group based on the individual's personality according to the big five test. However, I agree with the person who commented before me; some information seemed irrelevant for example in the extroversion section there was a whole paragraph on dog/cat people, who cares? How does that have anything to do with groupwork? Also the diagrams of the united states in each section seemed unnecessary. Even though it was interesting to compare my state amongst the others it is irrelevant in terms of group work. The main thing I felt this chapter was lacking was a solid conclusion piece.  A section that brings it all together and gives the reader some take home information.  Something along the lines of &quot;when forming a team it is important that these sets of personalities are apparent in each of the individuals and these other sets are not, this of course will require each individual to take the big 5 test.&quot;  Overall I feel the chapter would read a lot more smoothly if it was more conscise and included a concluding element.

I liked the picture that corresponded with Devil's Advocate, I also thought the maps that showed all the different categories were interesting, maybe not the best visual that could have been added, but interesting.  There were many examples and interesting facts that were pleasant to my eyes.  Overall I thought it conveyed the message that it was trying to get across.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A solid idea, to translate what we know about individual level biases to examine their impact at the group level. This chapter could use some work, still. There are few references to outside sources, and few links in the chapter to other places where the reader can go to develop further information (for example, wikipedia). The chapter could also use images to illustrate the points and break up the flow, as well as some consistency across sections. Some of the sections, for instance, include headings, while others do not. Also, why is the name of the chapter &quot;process losses&quot;? See, as an example, http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Managing_Groups_and_Teams/Which_attributes_are_fundamental_to_team_cohesion%3F

== Suggestions on this chapter. ==

I really enjoyed the sections on Recency Bias and the Curse of Knowledge.  I thought both of these sections were very well written and had a great flow to them.  I especially liked the use of real world/work situations to illustrate their points.  This made it very easy to internalize and understand how these sections can affect managers.  I felt the parts before the above mentioned sections were almost there.  They are very broken up and the reading didn't flow well.  Dropping the subheadings and using text in the paragraphs to connect each idea would help them flow better.
As for the remaining sections; they are very short, hard to read, and understand.  While examples were used some of the time it appeared to be thrown in without much explaination.  My main interest is in real world application.  How is this going to affect me as a manager?  In what context will it occur?  How can I become aware of said biases and overcome them?  These are more important to me than spitting out terminology.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter is well laid out and has good information on motivation. It could still use a bit of development, though. In particular, the laws of motivation need attribution. Did these come from an external source or from the group's work? The chapter could also use some figures or other graphics to help illustrate some of the points being made. The links in terms of personality tests are good, but additional links throughout the text would also be helpful to provide the reader with added opportunity to deepen understanding.

-------
The chapter was very well written and organized.  There was a lot of good information on motivation and this would be a good chapter to use for a research paper.  There were good examples which helped show the different laws and concepts you were talking about.  There could however be more pictures or figures to break up the words.  It looks a little daunting to read it the page because it's nothing but words.  Other than that the chapter was an interesting piece to read.
-------

The book was clear and concise.  I would only suggest considering some visuals.  Also, try to use some more in text citation in order to establish an authoritative voice.

I enjoyed reading this chapter, the information was clear and readable.  There was no major issues that would have made the chapter much better, maybe a few visuals would have helped, besides that I like it overall.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is part of a larger chapter on teambuilding. Focusing on the stages of group development is reasonable, but this page still needs some work. In particular, there is no mention or linkage to the broader topic of teambuilding, so the reader has no way of knowing why group stages are important for teambuilding. In addition, the chapter does not have citations in the text, or links in the text to other places where the reader can go to deepen his or her understanding.

This page is well written, but the content needs some help. The article provides a good explanation of the model, but it would be nice to see an evaluation of whether this model should be considered valid. The elements of each phase are mentioned, but what is the most important? This article has a lot of potential, but it needs to move beyond the explanations into an analysis of the model

Chapter 1:  Stages of group development:  Four stage model?  “Adjourning” as a fifth stage?  There is no mention of this stage in the introduction.  The way in which it is introduced in the Adjourning section is a little confusing as it is represented as an additional or new step in the model. There seem to be a lot of grammatical errors in the section on Norming.  The conclusion introduces new information (concept of overlap between stages and the idea that change can cause teams to revert to earlier stages or cyles).  This information would be better presented in a separate section not the conclusion.

----
 
This page has a solid layout, good use of lists in first two stages, but should continue to use the lists in the following two stages. Adjourning is the fifth stage so it should be included in the intro and conclusion. There are no links but one at the bottom of the page, and no references at all in the text. It's a good start, but it doesn't seem to be too in depth, it just covers the surface. New information is presented in the conclusion that should be in the body of the article and explained a little more.</text>

The page has inconsistent citation styles, and the inline citations should link to the references at the bottom of the page. The page could use images or figures as well. There are a few places where the wrong usage of words is also present (e.g., &quot;dominate personalities&quot;)


---
Be careful of using all inclusive phrases such as &quot;everyone&quot; or &quot;every team&quot;. There is enough diversity among individuals and teams that there will almost always be an exception to any generic rule.

Chapter 2:  Group dynamics:  Linearly this chapter does not seem to follow the previous one well.  The chapter does a great job at laying the foundation of many of the concepts that are cited in other chapters.  For example, I was not familiar with the term “Groupthink” when I read the first chapter.  I made an assumption about the definition but did not receive clarification until the following chapter.  I think that it may have worked better to lead with this chapter and then go to the stages of development.

---

This chapter does several things better than the previous. Citations are used, there is a good use of links in the body, and it has a pretty solid layout. The intro and conclusion needs some work aligning what will be said in the body in the intro, with what is said in the conclusion. Overall pretty solid page.</text>

Chapter 3:  Managing Groups and Teams / Psychological Profiling:  This chapter was very well structured and the ideas were communicated and supported well.

Be careful of consistency. Formal academic writing should be in the third person, but this article occasionally slipped into first (&quot;we&quot;) and second (&quot;you&quot;) person. Also, it would be nice to have more analysis of the models. Is one a better predictor of success than another? Are any of them outdated or based on faulty logic?
---
==Reliability?==
It might also be interesting to consider the reliability of the assessment procedures associated with each method. If people taking paper-based tests believe that certain profiles would advance their careers, then they may attempt to bias the results in their favor.

This was a pretty good page. It was well organized and informative, good use of a table. Flowed well and had good use of references, although no citations. There were no links as well, links would be great in the table on the personal competence side, I would have liked to look at some of them in more depth.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is part of a chapter on team building. This page needs considerable work. It does not explain how it fits into the broader topic of teambuilding, no transition from the previous section is provided. Also, the treatment needs to be deepened. Explaining potential benefits for teambuilding is not the same as explaining how it happens and under what conditions it makes sense. The two examples of team building activities are good, but it would be helpful to know what they accomplish (since different teambuilding activities have different purposes and objectives). Also, citations, figures, and illustrations would strengthen this page. See, as an example: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Managing_Groups_and_Teams/Which_attributes_are_fundamental_to_team_cohesion%3F

Team building activities are fun, but the detailed explanations do not seem to fit in the topic of managing teams. These activities are good examples, but it doesn't seem like this wikibook is the right forum for a &quot;how-to&quot;. Overall, this chapter is well written and has direction.
---

---
Chapter 4:  Managing Groups and Teams / Team Building Activities:  This chapter did a great job at citing the benefits that an organization may experience through team building activity and provided several examples.  There was little by the way of contrary evidence to the points that were being made.  I would have liked to have read more about some of the pitfalls or challenges related to this topic.  There was no conclusion.


----

This page does need some work. It starts out pretty good stating what team building can do, and then loses track. Some statistics would be helpful, references also - where is this information coming from? Also the activities don't specify what the goal is or how it will effectively help build the team. They are group activities, but they need to have practical applications in the workplace. Maybe just clarify what those applications are. Where is the conclusion?</text>

      <comment>/* Modal Operators */ not to note</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Modifiers ==

The basic Loglan sentence just defines a relationship but Loglan allows you to add more information if you wish. These extra words we group together as:

* Sentence modifiers

* Argument modifiers

* Free modifiers


=== Sentence Modifiers ===

Sentence modifiers include the time and space words and the logical contention words. They also include modal and causal relative operators. You can place a modal anywhere in a sentence but if they appear anywhere other than on the end of a sentance you might need a ''gu'' to say when the modeal ends and the remaining part of the sentence continues.

==== Modal Operators ====

Modal operators add information on who or in what way something relates to something else. They all come in CVV form.

* ''kii'' - With as in mi godzi ''kii'' tu (I walk with you)

* ''tie'' - using tool as in Da pa ''tie'' leda najda gu kutla de (someone, with a knife, cut something. Note the use of ''gu'' to end the modal)

* ''hea'' - with help as in mi kamla le hijra ''hea'' tu (I came here with your help)

==== Causal  Operators ====

Causal operators work just the same way as modal operators. Causal operators give the reason why a relationship holds. 

* ''kou'' - because of physical reason as in mi cetlo kou le crina  (I am wet because of the rain)

* ''moi'' - because of motive as in mi kamla le hijra ''moi'' lepo mi danza lepo mi vizka tu (I came because I wanted to see you)

* ''rau'' - because of reason as in mi fundi tu ''rau'' lepo tu minspu (I like you because you are clever)

* ''soa'' - because of premise  as in letu kukreo gu denro ''soa'' lepo ra dortau gu denro (your rifle is dangerous because all weapons are dangerous)

=== Argument Modifiers ===

Argument modifiers adds additional information to an argument such as making claims or identifying the argument. 

* ''ji'' - adds more information to identify the argument as in lemi hasfa  ''ji'' le redro hasfa,  gu snire (my house - the red house - is close)

* ''ja'' - makes a claim and adds more information about the argument as in lemi hasfa  ''ja'' le redro hasfa,  gu snire (my house, which is a red house, is close)

=== Free Modifiers ===

Theses modifiers add more information about the writer / speaker or about the sentence as a whole. They can go anywhere in a sentence without effecting the sentence (except after ''le'', ''la'' and the others in that group). Loglan contains a number of different types of free modifiers, which includes. 

* Attitude

* Discursive

* Parenthesis

==== Attitude ====

These all have a VV form and form groups depending on the first letter. The 'a' series deals with intention, 'e' with requests, 'i' with conviction, 'o' with obligation and 'u' with motive. The second letter deals with degree with 'a' as positive, 'i' mid way and 'u' as negative. Some examples:

* ''ua'' - satisfaction

* ''ui'' - happy 

* ''uo'' - anger

* ''uu'' - sorrow

* ''oa'' - must / feel obliged to do so

* ''ou'' - Doesn't matter

* ''ia'' - agree

* ''ii'' - maybe

* ''iu'' - don't know

* ''ei'' - is it so

* ''eo'' - please

* ''eu'' - assume

* ''ai'' - intend

* ''au'' - don't care

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Energy Accounting ==

Economic system represent a type of resources allocation system. In an economic system we have a set of resources, and set of production facilities, which produce a set of goods, used for consumption. Such a system requires energy to run. Actually, the system requires a set of energy producers that make available a supply of usable energies (exergy). People, though demands for goods, then drive the system.

=== Exergy as a common accountancy unit ===

The term &quot;exergy&quot; refers to the usable energy for a physical system and follows from the second law of thermodynamics; we cannot full change heat to work. Energy comes in different forms such as potential, chemical, kinetic and electrical energy. Not all forms of energy have the same potential to produce work. We can convert electrical energy completely to work  but cannot convert heat energy fully to work. 

As any socioeconomic system requires energy to work we can measure how much available energy (as exergy) we have and that will give us a measure of the system's ability to produce. 

A socioeconomic system not only needs energy but also materials. We can also use exergy as a measure of materials. This follows from the materials having a chemical potential. In addition, information can also have an exergy value. This follow from the application of statistical mechanics and information theory where we can define a particle as have one bit of information.

As we can use exergy to measure usable energy, materials and information that a socioeconomic system utilises, exergy, therefore, forms a common accountancy unit for any socioeconomic system. 

Exergy has an additional property of use for a socioeconomic system; exergy has a relationship to the environment. The greater the difference a system exhibits between itself and the surrounding environment the greater the exergy becomes. 

As exergy forms a common accountancy unit and has a relationship to the environment we can use exergy as a control variable for a resource allocation system such as a socioeconomic system.

=== Overview of an Exergy Based Socioeconomic System ===

A socioeconomic system based on exergy becomes a resources allocation system where we would have a system that uses state variables to control the system. The system would use exergy to measure the production cost of an item so each item produced would have a cost that reflects the physical cost of that item rather than a subjective monetary value. A society would also have a certain amount of exergy available for the production of each item. The resource allocation problem then becomes one of allocating exergy to production based on the user initiated demand for goods and the maintenance requirements of the system. We could do this through calculating how much exergy we would have available for production and distribute this capacity equally among the user base as &quot;Energy Credits&quot; (EC). The ECs effectively represent production capacity and the users can then allocate EC to production to acquire personal items.

==Discourse particles==
The following exclamations have no easy translation into English. They stand as a clause of their own:
:of consternation (it can't be!): ''a'''u'''''
:war cry (alala!) ''ì'''ley'''''
:of pity (poor thing!): ''ke'''ftxo'''''
:of anger or annoyance (aargh!) ''o'''ìsss'''''
:vulgar (screw that!) '''''pxa'''sìk''
:alarm cry; call to defense: '''''raw'''ke''
:as a threat: '''''sa'''a''
:upon exertion (oomph!) ''sa'''u'''''
:soothing (there there!) ''tam tam''
:of surprise and pleasure (wow!) '''''tew'''ti''
:of warning or frustration (oy!) '''''tsa'''-'''hey''', '''wi'''ya''

(See also 'yes', 'no', 'yeah', 'please', 'thank you', 'sorry!', 'forgive me!', 'right?', 'okay', 'understood', 'don't!', 'down!', 'well', 'hello', 'goodbye'.)''

The following emotive particles occur at the end of a clause: 
:soliciting agreement (Let's X; X, eh?) ''ko''
:surprise, exclamation, encouragement (Oh my! What an X!) ''nang''
:disparagement (Pshaw! You call that an X?) ''pak''

Others help the grammatical flow of discourse:
:direct address (O!) ''ma''
:continuation (And you?) ''tut''

=== Checklist for Publishing Meeting Notices with Agendas ===
;Acknowledgments 

Thanks to the efforts of the [http://PublicMeetings.info PublicMeetings.info], a project of [http://e-democracy.org E-Democracy.org]. This effort is funded by the Ford Foundation. 

The [http://ecitizenproject.org eCitizen Foundation] is helping to research and use its methodologies to create a checklist of open standards that municipalities and other organizations can use to better enable citizens to participate.

Slideshow explaining process of building the checklist: [https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dfxgcdfc_292g3m8jqn9 Slideshow about Project]

;Book Mission and Guidelines

Mission&lt;br /&gt;
Create a checklist for publishing a meeting notice with an agenda that makes it easier for citizens to learn about and participate in public meetings, especially for meetings that municipalities and communities. The checklist will stress methods and incorporate standards that are inclusive and as open as possible (OPIA- Open, Public and Integrated Architecture). Specifically, the requirements gathering will concentrate on three aspects of any public system architecture: the business layer, the legal issue layer and the technological implementation layer (BLT methodology). In addition, there will be a focus on the sociological aspects such as marketing and social networking.

Untested but should work dumb Prism-II specific PCMCIA PCI adapters 
&lt;pre &gt;
PCMCIA to PCI PLX Technology 9050 or 9052 chip 
3Com AirConnect 3CRWE777A (3.3V), Addtron AWA-100, Belkin F5D6000 (a rebadged WL11000P), Eumitcom WL11000P, 
Global Sun Technology GL24110P (untested), Global Sun Technology GL24110P02, Linksys WDT11 (a rebadged GL24110P02), 
Longshine 8031, Netgear MA301, Siemens/Efficient Networks SpeedStream 1023, US Robotics 2415 (rebadged WL11000P) 

&lt;/pre &gt;

ALERT To use the newest driver WPA Support you may need to [http://linux.junsun.net/intersil-prism/WinUpdate-0-7-0.exe Winupdate] the [http://linux.junsun.net/intersil-prism/firmware bios] on the card. This can be done under Windows with this [https://support.linksys.com/en-us/support/adapters/WPC11/download driver] but should always be a last resort because things can go wrong. 


NO support for Prism 2.5 pcmcia adapters

==Just a quick hello==
Hi, I am another mathematician working here on wikibooks.  I saw your note on the project page about a book on &quot;Famous theorems in Mathematics&quot;. If you'd like me to read anything over, or discuss ideas I would be happy to help.  I am a bit too tied up with a few other projects at the moment to do much writing.  But I would be happy to help in any way I can. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 20:00, 15 April 2010 (UTC)</text>

== Deleting a page ==

Hello, I noticed in the [[Calculus]] book that there were two nearly identical sections.  It is obvious one is a copy of the other.  Can you delete one of these?  One is [[Calculus/Integration techniques/Tangent Half Angle]] and I think that one should stay just because the name is better.  The other is [[Calculus/Integration techniques/Rational Functions Using Trig]] and I think this one should be deleted.  If you compare them, literally the only difference is the second has 2 extra worthless lines at the top.  Thanks, not sure how this works.

== Creating a New Book from an Old Book ==

Hi Aaron,

I dunno if you saw [[User:Mike1722]]'s questions in [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Assistance#Chemistry|the Reading Room]], but apparently, he wanted to make a new version of [[General Chemistry]], but aimed at Middle School students.  I suggested he start a new book, and he did.

But his [[Special:Contributions/Mike1722|Recent Contributions]] show that he has either decided to change General Chemistry, or he is mistakenly removing content from it.  I [[User talk:Mike1722|tried to get his attention]], but he has ignored my every attempt.  I was on the verge of blocking him and rolling back his changes, but then he stopped making edits (still without answering).  I don't want to do that, but he might force my hand.

I know the WB community frowns on forking, but in this case, I think it is completely justified.  I assume there is still no good way to make a copy (i.e., a fork) with a history merge - short of importing to a foreign wiki and then importing from there.  The only other option would be a manual copy, noting the history in the talk page.  I'd like to hear your thoughts on this whole matter (including whether we should block him if he continues to edit without responding). --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 16:12, 9 March 2010 (UTC)

:Noting the original page would be fine for CC-BY-SA, providing attribution.  I have rolled back all his edits.  They are all removals of valuable content from [[General Chemistry]] with no attempt to even refactor.  I would indeed block him if he were to return and start removing content from pages, degrading a book that was a featured book nominee in the past. Finally, I have queried the new book page he created. It's &quot;be bold&quot;, not &quot;be destructive&quot;. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:09, 9 March 2010 (UTC)
::I don't think he was trying to be destructive.  He is trying to create a new chemistry book for middle school and was trying to use [[General Chemistry]] as a starting point.  I believe he ''thought'' he was in his new copy when he started removing content.  He did eventually respond to my contact attempts, and was plenty contrite.  We need to be careful about biting the newbie.  Do you know of a good way for him to copy the work over to his new space and turn it into a derivative work?  Would it be sufficient to note the copy in the preface or in the introduction, or does it have to be mentioned on every single page (either in the talk page or maybe even in the edit summaries). --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 20:31, 9 March 2010 (UTC)

== template migration ==

Hi Adrignola,

Could you migrate over the templates (apart from NaviTOC) at [w:Category:Na'vi templates]? I copied two of them, but would prefer that we keep their histories intact. 

Thanks,

Oh, and I moved the dict. subpages to Na'vi/Na'vi-English dictionary/xx. The old pages can be deleted, as AFAIK n.t links to them.

Some words will be released over the next couple of weeks. Then I plan to post a (simpler) English-Na'vi dict, and will apply for featured status. [[User:Kwamikagami|—Kwami]] ([[User talk:Kwamikagami|talk]]) 11:55, 17 March 2010 (UTC)
== Question ==

Hi Adrignola,

I'm a bit confused here. I thought non-editors only saw reviewed versions of pages? But when I posted the English-Na'vi dict (which includes some words which have not yet been publicly released), and logged out, I could still see everything. So are unreviewed changes only not visible if the reader chooses them to be so? 

Thanks,
:[[User:Kwamikagami|—Kwami]] ([[User talk:Kwamikagami|talk]]) 12:45, 18 March 2010 (UTC)

::Non-editors will see the latest reviewed version of a page; however, if the page hasn't been reviewed at all, they will see the latest version.  All the pages of [[Na'vi]] are either reviewed up through the latest version or unreviewed (like [[Na'vi/English-Na'vi dictionary]]).  I assume that one unreviewed page is the one you're referring to.  If you don't want anonymous readers to see the latest version, you need to go to the history and review the specific revision that represents what they should see by default.  If readers couldn't see pages that hadn't been reviewed at all, the 75% of the pages in the wiki that haven't been reviewed for any revision couldn't be read.  And to answer your final question, readers can choose to view the draft version of a page via the indicator that appears if they aren't logged in and are viewing a page with unreviewed revisions. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:06, 18 March 2010 (UTC)

I'm not requesting a restore... the content you describe in the deletion notes does not merit restoration.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''[http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/ Gerrit]''' is a web-based code review tool for projects using the Git VCS. It allows both a streamlined code review process, and a highly-configurable hierarchy for project members. Typically, any user may submit patches (&quot;changesets&quot;) to the server for review. Once someone has reviewed the changes to a sufficient degree, they are merged into the main line of development, which can then be pulled.

==Overview==
===Implementation===

====Server====
Gerrit uses a dedicated [[wikipedia:Jetty (Web server)|Jetty server]], which is typically accessed via reverse proxy. Here's an example configuration for [[Apache]]:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 &lt;VirtualHost *&gt;
     ProxyRequests Off
     ProxyVia Off
     ProxyPreserveHost On
     &lt;Proxy *&gt;
         Order deny,allow
         Allow from all
     &lt;/Proxy&gt;
 
     # Reverse-proxy these requests to the Gerrit Jetty server
     RedirectMatch  ^/gerrit$                /gerrit/
     ProxyPass       /gerrit/                http://127.0.0.1:8081/gerrit/
 &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

====JGit====
Gerrit uses JGit, a [[Java]] implementation of git. This has several limitations: a sacrifice in speed, and some unimplemented features&lt;ref name=&quot;2ee99ed99609bb4b&quot;&gt;[http://groups.google.com/group/repo-discuss/msg/2ee99ed99609bb4b Re: Failure to submit due to path conflict but no real conflict.] (Shawn Pearce)&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, content-level merges are not supported in JGit - users must pull and merge changes, then re-upload them to the Gerrit server in cases where content-level merges are required.

====Permissions model====
Gerrit's permissions model allows a highly configurable hierarchy regarding who can submit patches, and who can review patches. This can be flattened out as desired, or ramped up, depending on the development model used for each project.

====Hooks====
The server allows scripts to run in response to certain events. Hook scripts live in $GIT_INSTALL_BASE/hooks, and must be set executable on Unix systems. A hook could - for instance - allow a project to install an automated gatekeeper to vote +2 'submit approved' when sufficient +1 votes 'looks good to me' have been received:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl
#
# comment-added: hook for a +2 approval from a simple quorum of +1 votes.
#
# (c) 2012 Tim Baverstock
# Licence: Public domain. All risk is yours; if it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.

$QUORUM = 2; # Total number of +1 votes causing a +2
$PLEBIANS = 'abs(value) &lt; 2'; # or 'value = 1' to ignore -1 unvotes
$AUTO_SUBMIT_ON_QUORACY = '--submit'; # or '' for none
$AND_IGNORE_UPLOADER = 'and uploader_account_id != account_id'; # or '' to let uploaders votes count

$GERRIT_SSH_PORT = 29418;
$SSH_PRIVATE_KEY = '/home/gerrit2/.ssh/id_rsa';
$SSH_USER_IN_ADMIN_GROUP = 'devuser';

# Hopefully you shouldn't need to venture past here.

$SSH = &quot;ssh -i $SSH_PRIVATE_KEY -p $GERRIT_SSH_PORT $SSH_USER_IN_ADMIN_GROUP\@localhost&quot;;

$LOG = &quot;/home/gerrit2/hooks/log.comment-added&quot;;
open LOG, &quot;&gt;&gt;$LOG&quot; or die;

sub count_of_relevant_votes {
        # Total selected code review votes for this commit
        my $relevance = shift;
        $query = &quot;
                select sum(value) from patch_sets, patch_set_approvals
                where patch_sets.change_id = patch_set_approvals.change_id
                and patch_sets.patch_set_id = patch_set_approvals.patch_set_id

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Setup==

===Importing project into Gerrit===
Whether or not you're permitted to do this depends on which access group(s) you're in, and where you're trying to do this. It is most useful for pushing pre-existing repos to the server, but it can in theory be used whenever you want to push changes which are not to be reviewed.

Use:
 $ git push gerrit:project HEAD:refs/heads/master
since you want to directly push into the branch, rather than create code reviews. Pushing to &lt;code&gt;refs/'''for'''/*&lt;/code&gt; creates code reviews which must be approved and then submitted. Pushing to &lt;code&gt;refs/'''heads'''/*&lt;/code&gt; bypasses review entirely, and just enters the commits directly into the branch. The latter does not check committer identity, making it appropriate for importing past project history.

The correct permission setup can be found here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8353988/how-to-upload-a-git-repo-to-gerrit. In addition, &quot;Push Merge Commit&quot; for &quot;refs/*&quot; may be needed for some repositories (for details see http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=1072).

==Use==
===Registering===
===Submitting changes for review===
Simply push into the project's magical &lt;code&gt;refs/'''for/''$branch'''''&lt;/code&gt; (typically master) ref using any Git client tool:
 $ git push ssh://user@host:29418/project HEAD:refs/'''for/master'''

Each new commit uploaded by the git push client will be converted into a change record on the server. The remote ref &lt;code&gt;refs/for/''$branch''&lt;/code&gt; is not actually created by Gerrit, even though the client's status messages may say otherwise. Pushing to this magical branch submits changes for review. Once you have pushed changes, they must be reviewed and submitted for merging to whatever branch they apply to. You can clone/pull from gerrit as you would any other git repo (no refs/for/branch, just use the branch name):
 $ git clone ssh://user@host:29418/project
 $ git pull ssh://user@host:29418/project master:testbranch

Gerrit currently has no &lt;code&gt;[[../git-daemon/]]&lt;/code&gt;, so pulling is via ssh, and therefore comparatively slow (but secure). You can run &lt;code&gt;git-daemon&lt;/code&gt; for the repositories to make them available via &lt;code&gt;git://&lt;/code&gt;, or configure Gerrit to replicate changes to another git repository, where you can pull from.

Since you will be frequently working with the same Gerrit server, add an SSH host block in ~/.ssh/config to remember your username, hostname and port number. This permits the use of shorter URLs on the command line as shown, such as:
 $ tail -n 4 ~/.ssh/config
 Host gerrit
     Hostname host.com
     Port 29418
     User john.doe
 $ git push gerrit:project HEAD:refs/for/master

Alternatively, you can also configure your remotes in git's configuration file by issuing:
 $ git config remote.remote_name.fetch +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
 $ git config remote.remote_name.url ssh://user@host:29418/project_name.git

This should be done automatically for you if you've started your local repository off of Gerrit's project repository using 
 $ git clone ssh://user@host:29418/project_name.git

Note that the Gerrit server has its own sshd with different host keys. Some ssh clients will complain about this bitterly.

====Re-submitting a changeset====
This is useful when there are issues with a commit you pushed. Maybe you caught them, maybe the reviewer did – either way, you want to submit changes for review, replacing the bad changes you submitted previously. This keeps code review in one place, streamlining the process. First, squash your changes into one commit using git rebase -i – you will probably want to change the commit message.

This doesn't actually replace the previous push, it just adds your updated changeset as a newer version.

You can provide a Change-Id line in your commit message: it must be in the bottom portion (last paragraph) of a commit message, and may be mixed together with the Signed-off-by, Acked-by, or other such footers. The Change-Id is available in the metadata table for your initial pushed commit. In this case, Gerrit will automatically match this changeset to the previous one.

Alternatively, you can push to a special location: the &lt;code&gt;refs/changes/*&lt;/code&gt; branch. To replace changeset 12345, you push to &lt;code&gt;refs/changes/12345&lt;/code&gt;. This number can be found in the URL when looking at the changeset you wish to replace: &lt;code&gt;#change,12345&lt;/code&gt;. You can also find it in the &quot;download&quot; section for the changeset: &lt;code&gt;...refs/changes/45/12345/1&lt;/code&gt; (choose the middle number: ignore &lt;code&gt;/45/&lt;/code&gt; and omit the trailing &lt;code&gt;/1&lt;/code&gt;). In this case, your push becomes:
 $ git rebase -i HEAD~2 # squash the relevant commits, probably altering the commit message
 $ git push gerrit:project a95cc0dcd7a8fd3e70b1243aa466a96de08ae731:refs/changes/12345

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;code&gt;'''git-daemon'''&lt;/code&gt; is a simple server for git repositories.

The daemon makes git repositories available over the &lt;code&gt;git://&lt;/code&gt; protocol, which is very efficient, but insecure. Where security is a concern, pull with [[SSH]] instead. The &lt;code&gt;git://&lt;/code&gt; protocol listens on port 9418 by default.

The daemon ''can'' be configured to allow pushing, however there is '''no authentication whatsoever''', so that is almost always a very bad idea. It may be appropriate in a closed LAN environment, where everyone can be trusted, however when in doubt, SSH should be used to push.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Rebasing==

If you want to change the commit messages, the order or the number of commits, use:
 $ git rebase -i HEAD~3
where HEAD can also be any other branch you are on and you can work on any number of commits, not just 3. You can delete commits, merge them together with &quot;squash&quot; or change their order. If something goes wrong, use
 $ git rebase -i --abort

Note that this will change all the commit-ids in the moved commits. These are because the commit-id also takes the commit's history in to account and the same change in a different place is considered a different commit by git. Rebasing shared changes can make combining those changes down the track difficult - you will not normally want to rebase any changes which has been incorporated in to somebody else's or a shared repository.

    Object *mui_win         = NULL;

    if (MUIMasterBase = (struct Library *) OpenLibrary(&quot;muimaster.library&quot;, 0)) {

        mui_app = ApplicationObject,

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Prescriptions with heavy sedatives are used to tranquilize the mind, suppress ''yang'' and purge ''fire'', when there is ''yang hyperactivity'' of the heart and liver.  These prescriptions tend to impair stomach-qi, and therefore prolonged administration is inadvisable. These prescriptions should not be taken in large dosages.

Sedative prescriptions with tonic effects are used to tranquilize the mind and nourish ''yin'' and blood. They are suitable for irritability as a result of failure of blood to nourish the heart and liver.

==Introduction==

&lt;pre&gt;

 CPU ---------------- Device Side Controller ---------------- Peripherals
      Controller Bus          Bridge          Peripheral Bus
         PCI, etc                                USB, etc
&lt;/pre&gt;


some or all of the public Poseidon includes are packed with these directives:
&lt;pre&gt;
#if defined(__GNUC__)
# pragma pack(1)
#endif
&lt;/pre&gt;
Any objections to removing this for ABIv1? in AROS we use native packing where possible.

That would mean code would stop being interchangeable between AROS/OS3/MorphOS/OS4 and would also affect binary compatibility with m68k on PPC. Not a good move IMHO. Perhaps adding some kind of #define or macro to only add the packing if M68K_COMPATIBILITY is enabled would allow better performance in platforms where no m68k transparent
emulator would be possible. There's no point in having binary compatibility for USB only. None of the
other system structures are packed. 

These  are  raw  USB  packets.  Don't  do this, or Poseidon will stop working. MorphOS uses pack(2).
Sorry, you're right about the pack(1) instances. However, there are other system structures packed with pack(2), which I still think should be unpacked.

==Introduction==


All display driver operations are moved to monitorclass. This should do for a good abstraction layer. 
To  finalize  this  up,  let's add that monitorclass will be the only place where Intuition will talk to  graphics drivers.  All other functions will use monitorclass instead of direct driver calls.
Currently this is only OpenScreen().
The only exception will be pointerclass, where it installs a colormap in sprite's bitmap. BTW, in fact we can remove this too, we'll need to add one more tag to AllocSpriteDataA(), something like SPRITEA_Palette.


1. Specifying gfx= and lib= on GRUB command line still works. It will work as long as you keep DEVS:Monitors/Default file in place.

2. You may load additional drivers if you want to. For newstyle drivers, just move the driver from Storage/Monitors to Devs/Monitors. Currently only SDL driver is newstyle. You may also use your old drivers (NVidia, Radeon, VMWare). In order to do this, make a copy of Storage/Monitors/Wrapper file in Devs/Monitors (name does not matter, you may name copies like &quot;NVidia&quot;, &quot;ATI&quot; - whatever you like) and edit icon's tooltypes (specify library and HIDD name there). Note that you can't have multiple instances of the same oldstyle driver - they are simply not designed with this in mind.

3. Don't attempt to do bizarre things like instantiating VGA and VESA at the same time via Wrapper. These drivers are special, they can manage only single display, and they can't coexist, even in theory. This is the way how hardware works, it's not some software issue. With time they will be rewritten and be more robust and resistant to such raping. :)

4. For hosted: you may create several GDI displays (on Windows), just edit GDI icon's tooltype. SDL doesn't allow this by design (again, SDL design, not driver design). X11 could allow this but it's too ancient. A volunteer is wanted to fix it. I can explain how.

5. You may add display drivers in runtime. Just doubleclick its file and that's it! However note that doing this while you're running VGA or VESA mode MAY cause problems (if new driver tries to steal hardware from VGA driver which is displaying your screen at the moment). Just reboot and it will be okay. Proper boot mode shutdown is a tricky part, it's a bit underdesigned at the moment. Consider it a WIP. If you run a driver for different card, there will be no problems. If you are already running native driver - again, no problems, native mode drivers perfectly live together (for example NVidia + ATI).

FindName(&quot;hidd.graphics.gc&quot;) can be handled similar to attribute IDs. Method IDs are also  numbered  in sequence. It's enough to know base ID, which is the ID of the first method, and then add mo_... offsets to it. 

Move initialization of the monitor drivers to C:LoadMonDrvs. NO!!!!!!!
There  is  a  rationale for it being where it is now. Loading display drivers  implies  unloading  boot-mode  drivers. Unloading a driver is technically possible only when there's no screens at all. Consequently, executing C:LoadMonDrvs from within a shell booted with no  startup-sequence,  or  even with auto-opened shell because of some error, will cause crash. IMHO it's quite not user-friendly. 

&gt; Although I believe there are (still?) some technical reasons on the PC architecture that would require AROS to make sure the monitor drivers are loaded before Intuition is up. It's  not  PC  architecture  limitation.  It's  AROS limitation. If a driver has some bitmaps, it can't be unloaded. Theoretically it's possible to implement safe unload by force-closing all  windows  and  screens,  however it would be difficult and perhaps require excessive amount of code.
So,  please,  keep  this where it is. And add a 'Do not load display drivers' checkbox to 'display options' in bootmenu. 




==Attributes==

Currently every HIDD bitmap in AROS has Hidd_BitMap_GfxHidd attribute telling   which  driver  was  used  for  creating  it.  Normally,  all operations  involving  this  bitmap  should  be  performed  using this driver. For example, if i'm going to create a GC for some drawing, I am supposed to call HIDD_Gfx_NewGC() on bitmap's driver. 

But  what  to  do  if the operation involves two bitmaps? For example CopyBox()?  On  which  driver  should  i call it? Here can be at least three cases:

 
:*both bitmaps belong to the same driver.
:*is simple and clear case.
:*one bitmap is a memory bitmap and another one is display driver's bitmap.


is  a  little bit more tricky. What driver should i call? Memory driver  or  card driver? Memory driver is relatively slow but can work with  anything.  What  about card driver? There is some chance that it can  accelerate  the  operation  using DMA. However, there can be some restriction  on  bitmap  (alignment for example), that has to be taken into  account  when  creating  memory bitmap. Because only card driver knows    about    these    restrictions,   we   should   have   called
HIDD_Gfx_NewBitMap() on its driver in order to create a memory bitmap. 
However  we  may  now know which driver to use during bitmap creation. 
Well, possible  solution  is  to  query  friend bitmap. If there's no friend  -  sorry, no luck. This means that we always perform CopyBox() on  card's  driver. Card driver is expected  to examine a memory bitmap, and accelerate  the  operation  if  possible  (it's in right place and has right format). Otherwise, call superclass.

 both  bitmaps are display bitmaps but belong to different drivers (different displays on different GFX cards).

is  the  most  problematic  case.  Which  driver  to call? Is it possible   even  in  theory  that  two  cards  may  perform  DMA data transmission  from one to another? Or two independent outputs of the same card (from machine's point of view they are two different devices AFAIK) ?





The next Big Question is what to do with two object pools One of them keeps GCs and another keeps temporary planar bitmap objects. From  the  first  point  of view, they just should be global. However only from the first... If  we  go  deeper, GC class may be subclassed (noone currently does this,  this  is why this still works). Currently graphics.library just creates  objects  of  CLID_HIDD_GC  class,  and taking subclasses into account this is wrong. GCs should be created using HIDD_Gfx_NewGC() on the driver which is going to use them. This means that GC cache should stay driver-specific.

As  to  planar  bitmaps, the situation is much more complex. Above we came  to  a  conclusion  that  memory  bitmaps  may be friends of VRAM bitmaps,  if  they  meet  specific  requirements.  In such a case card
driver  may use hardware acceleration when working with them. However, this  means  that  we can't take arbitrary empty object from the cache and  attach  it to an arbitrary bitmap. The bitmap was created without
anything  in  mind,  so  an  attempt  to attach an object with GfxHidd attribute  pointing  to a GFX driver is a nonsense. It likely will not work!  Even  if  we  have  separate pools per driver, this won't help,
because temporary objects are not associated with theit bitmaps in any way. A pool becomes a cesspool... :)

Yes,  we  could  always  create  planar  bitmaps  using memory driver (object  of  CLID_HIDD_Gfx  class).  However in this case we should be ready  that  working  with  planar bitmaps is always slow because it's always performed using CPU. 

1. Neither nvidia nor ati hidds (nor any other) are allowed to poke the private planarbm data of gfx.hidd directly.
2. Planar bitmap for given font is created *once* and used many times 
3. Both nvidia and ati hidds may store there the planar data in a form which is best optimised for font drawing.

graphics.library does not poke this bitmap directly, therefore nvidia and ati hidds have their own planar bitmaps where they *are allowed to* poke directly. Have a look at BlitColorExpansion methods defined there.



==Pixel Format==

vHidd_StdPixFmt_ARGB32 instead of vHidd_StdPixFmt_Native32 in
the HIDD_BM_GetImage() and HIDD_BM_PutImage() calls.





==Cursors==

This  is  really  strange  behavior.  One  question first: do you set
aHidd_Gfx_SupportsHWCursor to TRUE? If not, you get undefined behavior
because fakegfx.hidd plugs in, and it relies on framebuffer existence.




==Screen Drag==

You may implement screen drag. Note two attributes: 
:&lt;code&gt;aHidd_BitMap_LeftEdge&lt;/code&gt; 
and
:&lt;code&gt;aHidd_BitMap_TopEdge.&lt;/code&gt;

ScrollVPort() just sets them. Do whatever you need in the code. They should be also gettable (superclass always returns 0). This is used in order  to provide an ability for the driver to fix up invalid offsets. After  setting  these  attributes  ScrollVPort()  gets  them back, and only  after  this  they  go  into  ViewPort.  This  way  you may limit scrolling.

Offset  is counted from physical screen corner to bitmap corner (i.e. it's negative if you're panning around the bitmap which is larger than the screen).

In order to tell Intuition that screens may be bigger or smaller than the   display,   there  are  additional  sync  attributes:  Sync_VMin, Sync_VMax,  Sync_HMin,  Sync_HMax.  By default they equal to HDisp and VDisp  respectively,  but this will be overridden if you expliticly set them.




==Framebuffer==

First, i can explain  why  it  works  this  way  when  you  call DoSuperMethod().  Look  at Show() implementation in the base class. It will  return  NULL  if  framebuffer  is  not  present. This means that SDD(GfxBase)-&gt;frontbm       (see      rom/graphics/grtaphics_driver.c, SDD(GfxBase)-&gt;driver_LoadView())  will  always  stay  NULL.  There's a comparison  before  so  that  Show() will never be called twice on the same bitmap.

I  guess  you  need  to add some debug output to driver_LoadView() in order to see what happens and why. Remember  that  things are expected to work correctly when you always return msg-&gt;bitMap in your Show().

Some explanation of what is actually done in driver_LoadView(): 

When  system  uses  framebuffer,  there's only one framebuffer bitmap which is really displayable and it is always on display. graphics.hidd baseclass  in  its  Show()  simply  copies  the  bitmap to show into a framebuffer,  and  returns  framebuffer  pointer.  Then  the  code  in driver_LoadView()  takes  struct BitMap which is being shown and swaps objects  in  it. Original object is saved in SDD(GfxBase)-&gt;bm_bak. Two other saved things are color model number and colormap object. Returning original pointer from Show() makes this code to actually do nothing (objects are swapped with themselves).




The following methods and attributes have been added to our graphics classes:

1. HIDD_Gfx_GetGamma() and HIDD_Gfx_SetGamma() - explained in the autodoc. They are designed in such a way that it's possible to implement MorphOS API on top of it (if we want it).

2. Changing  display  frequencies.  In order to make them changeable you'll have to:
- Supply aHidd_Sync_Variable = TRUE to your sync objects.
- Your    sync    objects    should   contain   complete   data
(aHidd_Sync_HSyncStart, aHidd_Sync_HSyncEnd, aHidd_Sync_VSyncStart   and   aHidd_Sync_VSyncEnd  should  not be zeros).

 Implement  HIDD_Gfx_SetMode()  method  in your graphics driver.
This method now receives a pointer to a modified sync object.
You're  not  switching  screens, so you keep current bitmap. Just you get  notified that this sync changed. A driver is expected to check if the  given sync is on display at the moment and rebuild the display if needed.

&lt;pre&gt;
Show gets called with bitmap
From bitmap I extract ModeID
Using ModeID I get Sync from moHidd_Gfx_GetMode
This sync is stored
&lt;/pre&gt;

Should I compare the passed Sync with the one I stored during Show? 
If so, how should the comparison be done - by checking pointers (it's the same object) or by checking if aoHidd_Sync_HDisp/aoHidd_Sync_VDisp between two syncs? Also what if I get passed sync that has different hdisp/vdisp (meaning I would need new bitmap) than the current one

In order to try out (2), a MonED program will do. It can be built as Prefs/Monitor. It is not built by default since currently it's very experimental. 

P.S.  Modification of total_color_clocks in the MonitorSpec result in modification of aHidd_Sync_PixelClock, while aHidd_Sync_HTotal stays constant.  I  don't  know  if  it's  correct,  modify  this if needed. However,  if  both parameters need to be changed, perhaps, direct sync
object   access   is  needed.  Sync  object  pointer is placed into SpecialMonitor-&gt;reserved1, and i think it will stay there forever.

First, now it's completely okay to fetch an object and use OOP calls on it. The respective MonitorSpec will be maintained automatically.

Second, sync object became really smart, and it does not allow to modify  things that shouldn't be modified (like VDisp/HDisp, Variable, Description, and so on).

Third, now you'll get a notification if something really changed (one of timing attributes was supplied to the OOP_SetAttrs().

Fourth, do_monitor() still there and it still  works. However i changed  it to modify HTotal instead of PixelClock. I guess it's close to the original behavior. I agree that it doesn't fit well for our video  hardware,  so  you  may feel free to write your own display mode editor from scratch. :)  

An  associated sync object may be found in MonitorSpec-&gt;ms_Object (this is an aliased field of never  used DisplayInfoDatabase list). You may simply get this object, and use OOP_GetAttr() and  OOP_SetAttrs() on it. Your graphics driver will be notified by the sync object automatically, you don't need to call SetMode() yourself.




==Overlays==

HIDD_Gfx_NewOverlay() just reserves memory for the overlay. Reserving a memory does not have something to do with current screenmode anyway.
Next the overlay needs to be brought on display. I suggest there will be some HIDD_Overlay_Show() method.

Since the overlay object is created by graphics driver object, the driver can pass a reference to whatever data is needed using private attributes of an overlay class implementation.

The driver prepares scaling according to the given rectangle and resolution of currently visible display.

This  is  also  covered by passing data from driver object to overlay object.

I would leave this to the driver. Many cards support *any* key color, but assuming validity of this statement for all graphics chips would be a wrong decision. Let graphics driver decide itself.

Hmmm... I see one big quirk here...
As  i  can understand, color keying is used to enable depth-arranging windows  with  attached  overlays.  Overlay's  area is filled with key color and overlay is visible only through this color.

But let's imagine a situation...

&lt;pre&gt;
+------------------+
|                  |
|  video window    |
|          +--------------+
|          |     some     |
+----------|     fancy    |
           |    painting  |
           +--------------+
&lt;/pre&gt;

If  key  color  happens  to  be present in &quot;some fancy painting&quot;, the video will be visible there instead of it, in the part where it covers video window.
What to do? How will i know that key color will never be found on the desktop?
It  doesn't matter who generated the color. Second window can be even not opened at the moment of color generation.

Don't forget to implement SwapVLayerBuffer() and VOA_DoubleBuffer/VOA_MultiBuffer tags, by the way. Having a triple-buffered overlay is much nicer with mplayer and its subtitles in particular. :)

Regarding depth, it follows the intuition window, but to achieve that, you need to set VOA_ColorKey tag at vlayer creation (which will fill the intuition with some particular backfill colour by default i think). With that colorkey, cgxvideo knows where to display overlay video and where not in a window. So if a window is partially or totally covered, the vlayer will be handled accordingly, following depth arrangement.

Color keying was going to be the next question. So do i understand correctly that:

1.  If  you specify VOA_ColorKey to TRUE the system will pick up come color for keying and fill overlay area in the window with this color. 
2.  At  any  moment  i  can  obtain  color value and pen number using GetVLayerAttr() with VOA_ColorKey and VOA_ColorKeyPen.
3.  After  this video overlay will be clipped accordingly to the part of display filled by the key color.

Should the driver provide key color value (because hardware may impose some limitations on it) or the library should  pick  it  up  and  provide to the driver.

if there can be (in theory) several overlays on one display ?
More than one real overlay sounds very unlikely for less than two graphic cards - actually with cgxvideo the API would allow that, however this never was implemented under AOS (at least on publicly
available cards).

Normally an application would expect to get the single, fast overlay - if there is more than one, and all the additional ones are slower, this raises the question why not better directly blit to the bitmap
in such cases.

Consequently, if more than one overlay is available - with some being emulated, and possibly slowly emulated - there also should be a way for applications to determine whether the currently
locked overlay is a real one or not. So they can decide among this and other available options (e.g. using their own AltiVec code and directly blit).

It depends on the hardware and, actually, on the driver. Video overlay can be
done in two ways:

1. As a real overlay supported by the gfx card. Here, one, two or maybe three overlay objects are allowed to coexist at the same time (one overlay is the most common case, though)
2. Overlay could be a 2D surface blitted by the 3D engine. Here, the amount of available overlays is limited only by available memory.

Implement   a  video overlay class similar to bitmap class. This would  let  to create several overlays (if some hardware ever supports this).  BTW,  may  be  bitmap  and overlay do not differ? Does not make sense  to have the same set of methods for both bitmap and overlay? In this  case we would have to extend pixelformat class to accommodate new formats (like YUV or YPbPr).
Usually one do not use any methods like line/rect drawing on overlay object. Accessing the YUV data directly is much more likely. Probably you checked it anyway, however regarding cgxvideo the following is important to keep in mind:

 SRCFMT_YUV16
 (not recommended, use YCbCr16 instead)
 SRCFMT_YCbCr16
 SRCFMT_RGB15PC
 SRCFMT_RGB16PC

I.e. four formats to be supported and YUV not being the recommended one.

YcbCr16 works fine and is obviously better suited than RGB for an application like mplayer that provides YUV data. But your cgxvideo doc is a bit outdated. There's also an additional pixel format since a few years: SRCFMT_YCbCr420 (YV420, planar overlay), which is quite interesting when the gfx card supports it, since it only needs 12bits per pixel, instead of 16, giving a nice speedup at copy.




== ScreenDepth()==

Screendepth() always calls RethinkDisplay(), even when screen order is not changed. 
If  you  look at ScreenDepth() code you'll see checks if the screen is not already first/last. 
You  can  try  moving  RethinkDisplay() into these conditions. 

On the other hand, originally MrgCop() does not clobber the screen on already  active  view  AFAIK.  So,  the  actual  problem  is likely incorrect implementation in your driver. 

I  suggested  the  following model: every bitmap contains two states: actual   and   pending  one. Pending  state  is  recalculated  during PrepareViewPorts,  and  during  ShowViewPorts  pending  state  becomes active  one.  Actual  hardware  update  happens  only  if new state is different from old one. 
Yes, ShowViewPorts immediately folow PrepareViewPorts on active view.






==Introduction To Many Monitors/Cards==

Uses different driver instances would be easier than introducing some new concept like units. 
Additionally it fits OOP paradigm  perfectly.  

Driver = class and instance = object. 
Several outputs on the same card = several similar cards = several objects of one class.

First, DEVS:Monitors  and SYS:Storage/Monitors directories appeared. Currently  Storage/Monitors is  empty (except on hosted ports) and DEVS:Monitors contains only single Wrapper file.
Now  display  drivers  may  come  in a new form - as plain executable which is put into DEVS:Monitors directory. An example of building such a  driver  is  overhauled SDL driver in arch/all-hosted/hidd/sdl. Note startup.c file and comments in it. 

In  order  to  write a boot-time driver (which can be used to boot up the system), a simple struct Resident needs to be added to the driver, which will call its startup code. There's no need to build a library or something like it.

A function of Wrapper program is to load a display driver which is specified in old way (in kernel command line or S:hidd.prefs file). Note that it completely ignores input drivers, they are now completely separated. This allows to use old display drivers until they are rewritten. 

I strongly suggest display drivers authors to convert their code to a new form. After some time support for S:hidd.prefs and command line arguments will be completely removed. 

Display driver startup code should do the following:

1. Open  needed  libraries,  obtain  OOP attribute bases, create OOP classes. Classes do not have to be public, nobody will refer to them by names.

2.  Scan  available  hardware (PCI bus, OF tree, whatever) and create gfx driver objects for every supported device.

3.  Call graphics.library/AddDisplayDriver() on every created object. The functions returns ZERO on SUCCESS and NONZERO on failure. It's  completely  up  to  driver's  author  what  to  do  in  case of double-start  (if the user double-clicks on your driver icon, just for fun  :)).  Normally  it's  expected  that the driver should not re-add hardware  that  is  already  used.  Our  current PCI subsystem doesn't support  devices  ownership, perhaps this needs to be changed. You are
free  to invent absolutely anything. For example, SDL driver does this by registering its OOP class as public, and trying to find this class upon  every  startup.  If the class is already present, we are already running.

Note that currently AddDisplayDriver() is A HACK! It shuts down and destroys  previously installed display driver, and removes it from the database.  So  for  now  do not create more than one object. Implement some  #define  in your code for this. When graphics.library completely
supports  multi-display  environment,  this  #define  will  need to be removed.
The only thing a client knows is that &quot;We have a display and here is its instance&quot;. AddDisplayDriver() function does this. It inserts the driver into database and assigns monitor ID (upper half of mode ID) to it. That's all. After this it's up to the user on which display to open his screens. All displays work in similar manner.

Users just need to move a display driver from Storage/Monitors to DEVS:Monitors in order to  activate it. It will automatically be installed in the system if it finds the hardware. If there's no usable hardware, it will do nothing.

Display  drivers  may  have  icons.  Loader  code  looks  at STARTPRI tooltype and uses its value as a priority level. This is done in order to make display mode ID assignment more predictable in future (IDs are assigned in the order in which drivers are loaded).

Note  that  SDL  driver  can't  be loaded from S:hidd.prefs any more, because it's not a library any more! Just place it into DEVS:Monitors and reboot, the rest will be done automatically.

Note  that  CURRENTLY  display  drivers  can't  be  added on the fly. Attempting to do this will give unpredictable results. This is graphics.library problem, the support is incomplete.
So,  for  now,  do  not  attempt  to  run  display  drivers  by hands! Especially  Wrapper  which currently can't have doublestart protection by design (well, it can, but i don't want to bother about the code which will go away after some time).

Part 2. Input subsystem.

In order to transparently deal with (possibly multiple) input sources two new HIDDs were designed: keyboard.hidd and mouse.hidd. They act in the  same  way as PCI &quot;master class&quot; does. They are responsible for communication between drivers and clients.

In  order  to  start  talking  to an input subsystem, the program (or driver) needs to create an instance of CLID_Hidd_Kbd (for keyboard) or CLID_Hidd_Mouse (for mouse). The program may provide callback function during  object creation, in this case the program will act as a client
and  will  receive input events. The callback is executed in interrupt context, the same as before.
Currently  the  only clients are keyboard.device and gameport.device. lowlevel.library is welcome to join them. :)

In order to register an input driver, AddHardwareDriver() method has to be called on the &quot;master&quot; object. A parameters for this call are driver  class  pointer (not ID!) and optional additional taglist. You don't supply pre-made objects because master class needs to provide own
callback function for every driver.

A driver can be registered at any moment, without any restrictions. 

Input streams from multiple drivers are just merged into a single stream.

AddHardwareDriver() returns a pointer to driver's instance. At any moment it can be removed using RemHardwareDriver(). There's no need to call OOP_DisposeObject() on it since RemHardwareDriver() does it by itself.

!!! I need help !!!

Some cleanup needs to be done for other architectures. A startup code needs  to  be added to PC-native mouse and keyboard drivers. They need to  learn  to  register  themselves.  Currently they are registered by dosboot resident using backwards compatibility kludge code relying on
oldstyle  struct  BootConfig.  I  know, Michal hates it, and it really needs to be removed (currently X11 and PC native input rely on this, i think i'll update X11 myself soon).
Some other tasks in this field can be: 

1. Implement  boot  options  and  display  options  screens  in  the bootmenu.  A  boot  options  screen  may  present a similar choice to original  AmigaOS.  Display  options  screen  can contain at least one checkmark  which  disables  loading  display  drivers  (this  is why i
decided to put the loader into dosboot and not into Startup-sequence). Perhaps  it  even could do some advanced things like listing available drivers and allowing to disable some of them (doable with more dosboot overhaul).
2. Separate serial mouse driver from PS/2 mouse driver. The new input subsystem allows them to coexist, and even co-work in the same time. 
3.  Implement  more  functions  in  lowlevel.library (since currently there can be more than one input event listener). 
4. Draw icons for Monitors drawer and display drivers. :)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cybergrafix supports some very fine functions to select a screenmode, for example BestCModeIDTagList, which gets the best screenmode for a specified tag list of screen attributes. 

For writing pixels, reading Pixels and blitting,  there are the functions FillPixelArray, MovePixelArray, ReadPixelArray, ScalePixelArray, SwapPixelArray, WritePixelArray and WriteRGBPixel. 

For double buffering you use standard Double Buffering functions like the functions around AllocScreenBuffer.  

Cybergrafix supports a function to get some information about the (modified) Bitmap structure, but (sadly) you do not get the address of the  video memory. So you can't write directly to the video memory.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The claim that the atmosphere &quot;makes the earth warmer&quot; cites as evidence that the global mean temperature is about 10 degrees higher, but that appears to be an unfair comparison. Given that the Stefan-Boltzmann Law has a T^4 component and the temperature distribution of the Earth is non-uniform, one cannot compare the ''blackbody'' temperature of a fictional earth to the ''average'' temperature of the current one.

Instead, one should calculate the fourth root of the average value of T&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; to make a fair comparison.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In cryptography, an unborken algorithm is not necessarily an unbreakable one.
There have been many cryptographic algotithms made and deployed in various situations throughout the world, some dating back from the time of Julius Cesar! More recent algorithms, AES Rijndael for example, are very strong, and have survived close scrutiny for many years and have remained secure. But, many other algorithms such as the vigenere cipher were once belived to be totally unbreakable, but then all of a sudden, they may as well be written in plaintext. It was once thought that the simple XOR cipher could be the answer to an unbreakable algorithm, but new methods of cryptanalasys were born, and now, it can be cracked within moments.

Today's 'secure' ciphers such as AES and Twofish may be secure now, but in the future, with the advent of faster computers, better techniques and even quantum computing, these ciphers will only last so long.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The UN Philatelic ==

The UN (United Nations) is regarded as a supra-national postal administration. 

Argentina was the first in 1947 to propose that the United Nations to publish its own postal value. In 1951 the United Nations reached an agreement with the United States to issue a postal value in U.S. currency and use only within the UN headquarters in New York. On October 24, 1951, at the United Nations Day, was issued the first stamp. 

There are three offices in charge of stamps in UN New York began to issue stamps in 1951, followed by Geneva in 1969 and Vienna in 1979. 

The stamps issued by the UN nature linked to the value and supranational political organization, and so there is a strong preference for themes related to peace and development. Another strand is followed very dedicated to the flora and fauna, natural beauty. Do not miss emissions themed space (and human space exploration adventures), the UNESCO world heritage, the family, the integration of the races to road safety etc..

NOTE: Much of the formatting and text structures have been borrowed from the [[Neapolitan|'''Neapolitan''' Wikibook]]. Sections may be more or less similar to their counterparts.

Welcome to the Wikibook of the Pizzonese dialect. Pizzonese is a Western Abruzzese variant of Neapolitan with origins in N. Molise. It was widely spoken in the renowned village of Pizzone, but is now spoken by a few several hundred ''Pizzonesi'' emigrants (which is a lot by demographic standards). Pizzone itself is the Molisean place with the highest number (or proportion) of colonizers and emigrants acorss the world. Pizzonese is related to many other Western Abruzzese dialects across northern Isernia and the southeastern fringes of Ciociara, [http://www.settefrati.net/dialetto3-1.htm Settefratese] being a good example.

For new books we like to put the contents on the main page, for easier navigation and linking.  When you view a subpage you'll see that automatic link to the root at the top; clicking that lets you jump right to the contents then without having to go down a level again for a contents page that is placed on a subpage rather than the root.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Please consult a doctor or herbalist for proper application of oils. The perfumery note of an oil refers to the rate at which the oil evaporates. Top notes evaporate more quickly and base notes more slowly. As a result, top note scents are perceived more quickly than base note scents.

==Final vowels and vowel reduction==
A good portion of Pizzonese words end in ''-e'', this unstressed '''e''' stands for the schwa sound that has become such a distinct part of Southern Italian languages. The schwa (the English '''uh''' sound) is the most frequent vowel in Pizzonese, let alone in the Neapolitan language continuum itself. In Pizzonese, any unstressed '''a, e, o, i,''' and '''u''' in writing can be weakened into short versions of themselves, and are even simplified down to a schwa in some situations. The '''a''' stays the strongest out of all the vowels though, and is only partially weakened most of the time, so that way you can still tell the original '''a''' sound. Examples of vowel reduction are in the words ''c'''u'''menzà'' and ''camm'''i'''nié''. Similarly, Neapolitan has much the same guidelines as Pizzonese. (Or should I say otherwise!)

==Consonants==
The consonants of Pizzonese are ''b, c, d, f, g, h, j, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, u, v,'' and ''z''. Depending on the consonant, they could be basic as in English, they could be palatalized, silent, or operate in conjunction with another letter. Here's an explanation of all vowels and vowel combinations.

====Regular consonants====
The regular consonants' are pronounced consistently and as in English and Italian with the only modification being doubling, being ''b, d, f, j, l, m, n, p, r, s,'' and ''t''

====Digraphs====
There are as the above, except they are digraphs or accented, and thus not counted as letters on their own:
*'''c:''' pronounced as in English and Italian before '''a, o,''' and '''u''', but before '''e''' and '''i''', they are...</text>

==Note to moderators==
Much of the formatting for this Wikibook was borrowed from the [[Neapolitan|''Neapolitan'' Wikibook]]. I of course figure it is alright because for one, Neapolitan is the parent language of Pizzonese. Contact me on my [[User:L'Orgoglio|personal discussion page]] if you are to shut down this Wikibook for any guideline I could have infringed.

[[Image:Chinesemustardgreens.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cantonese-style braised mustard greens, with wolfberries]]
'''''Brassica juncea''''', also known as '''mustard greens''', '''Indian mustard''' and '''leaf mustard''', is a species of mustard plant. Sub-varieties include Southern Giant Curled Mustard, which resembles a headless cabbage such as [[Cookbook:Kale|Kale]], but with a distinct horseradish-mustard flavor. It is also known as ''green mustard cabbage''.

==Uses==

The leaves, the seeds, and the stem of this mustard variety are edible. The plant appears in some form in African, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, and Soul food cuisine. Cultivars of ''B. juncea'' are grown as greens, and for the production of oilseed. The leaves are used in African cooking, and leaves, seeds, and stems are used in Indian cuisine, particular in Punjab cuisine of India and Pakistan, where a famous dish called 'Saarson da saag'(lit. mustard greens) is prepared. ''B. juncea'' subsp. ''tatsai'' which has a particularly thick stem, is used to make the Indian pickle called Achar, and the Chinese pickle ''zha cai''. The mustard made from the seeds of the Brassica juncea is called brown mustard. The leaves (Raai / Rai in Gujarati) are used in many Indian dishes. 

Brassica juncea is more pungent than the closely-related ''Brassica oleracea'' greens (kale, cabbage, collard greens) and is frequently mixed with these milder greens in a dish of &quot;mixed greens&quot;, which may include wild greens such as dandelion.  As with other greens in soul food cooking, mustard greens are generally flavored by being cooked for a long period with ham hocks or other smoked pork products.  Mustard greens are high in Vitamin A and Vitamin K.</text>

As with other Romance languages, adjective endings in Pizzonese change depending upon the gender and quantity of the item they are modifying.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|style=&quot;width:100px&quot;, bgcolor=&quot;#e9e3c5&quot;|'''Gender'''
|style=&quot;width:100px&quot;, bgcolor=&quot;#e9e3c5&quot;|'''Singular'''
|style=&quot;width:100px&quot;, bgcolor=&quot;#e9e3c5&quot;|'''Plural'''
|-
|align=&quot;left&quot;|masculine
|align=&quot;left&quot;, bgcolor=&quot;#c9c8a9&quot;|'''gle'''
|align=&quot;left&quot;, bgcolor=&quot;#c9c8e9&quot;|'''le'''
|-
|align=&quot;left&quot;|feminine
|align=&quot;left&quot;, bgcolor=&quot;#c9c8a9&quot;|'''la'''
|align=&quot;left&quot;, bgcolor=&quot;#c9c8e9&quot;|'''le'''
|}

For the most part, adjectives follow the object they describe, for example ''la casa ghiénca'' (the white house), literally it reads &quot;the house white&quot;.

==Possessive adjectives==

|align=&quot;left&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#c9c8e9&quot;|le sê
|align=&quot;left&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#c9c8e9&quot;|la sê
|}

In Pizzonese, as with other Southern Italian languages, there can be a fusion of the possessive adjective with the noun it refers to. This mainly applies to possessive kinship terms; '''pateme''' for ''my father''; '''frateme''' for ''my brother''; '''sorema''' for ''my sister''; '''soreta''' for ''your sister''. This applies only to words that indicate familiar relationships and is a vestige from Ancient Greek, and is somewhat related to the French counterpart.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Theorem''' – weak L'Hôpital's rule – Let &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; &amp;sube; '''R''', ''u'' &amp;isin; &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, and ''f'', ''g'': &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; \ {''u''} → '''R''' be  differentiable functions such that &amp;exist;lim&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; g' &amp;isin; '''R''', and  lim&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; g' &amp;ne; 0. If 
#&lt;math&gt;\exists\lim\limits_{u} f=0,\quad\exists\lim\limits_{u} g=0&lt;/math&gt; and 
#&lt;math&gt;\exists\lim\limits_{u}\frac{f'}{g'}\in \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; 
then lim&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;(f/g) also exists, and  
:&lt;math&gt;\lim\limits_{u}\frac{f}{g}=\lim\limits_{u}\frac{f'}{g'}&lt;/math&gt;

''Proof.'' 1) ''u'' is an accumulation point of he domain of ''g''. Since, lim&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; g' &amp;ne; 0.

2) Both ''f'' and ''g'' extend to an &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;  → '''R''' differentiable function, by setting ''f''(''u'')=0 and ''g''(''u'')=0. Indeed, by Lagrange Theorem, for every ''x'' &amp;isin; &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; there is an x'&amp;isin; &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; between ''x'' and ''u'' such that 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{g(x)-g(u)}{x-u}=g'(x')&lt;/math&gt;
Hence, 
:&lt;math&gt;g'(u)=\lim\limits_{x\to u}\frac{g(x)-g(u)}{x-u}=\lim\limits_{x'\to u}g'(x')=\lim\limits_{u}g'\in \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;</text>

{{Pizzonese}}

==Conjugation of regular nouns==

There are 3 standard infinitive verb forms in Pizzonese, ending in ''-à, -è/-ere'' and ''-ì''.

*'''-ccì''' = 2 hypothetical consonants + 1 '''ì'''
*'''-acì''' = 1 hypothetical vowel + 1 hypothetical consonant + 1 '''ì''' 
With the second conjugation infinitives,&lt;br/&gt;
*'''-è''' (formerly ''-ère'') is used when the ultimate (formerly penultimate) syllable is stressed–as in ''ved'''è''''' (formerly ''ved'''è'''re'')
*'''-ere''' is used when the antepenultimate syllable is stressed–as in ''d'''í'''cere''
Also note that '''()''' denotes stem changes, which will be explained soon.

===Simple future===

This is a more recent edition to Pizzonese, as the advent of Italian and Neapolitan has made these rather automated to grammar, but has now become a shortcut. The simple remote form as used below though is barely used, as ''Pizzonesi'' usually speak of the future in terms of what they ''have to'' do, as originally there were no future tenses (as in ''I will (be)''), and future events were talked about in terms of &quot;being done later&quot; (''chiù doppe'').

&quot;The Book&quot; is a concept introduced by [[Wikipedia:Paul Erdős|Paul Erdős]]. The Book contains the shortest, most elegant, most illuminating, and most memorable proof of every existing or future mathematical theorem. These are &quot;The Book proofs.&quot;  The highest compliment Erdős could pay to a colleague’s work was to say, “That’s straight from The Book.” '''WikiProject Vestibule to The Book''' is a group of wikibookians who collaborate on the wikibook [[Vestibule to The Book]] in which the potential proofs from Erdős's imaginary book are collected. The project aims to help coordinate and organize the writing and editing of this wikibook.

We will open a separate web page which will contain the selected (by election, voting) proofs. So this wikibook is the collaborative vestibule to the final fixed book: Proofs from The Book. 

0. The final repository is named :  Proofs from The Book

1. The project name

The Vestibule project

2. The wikibook name

Vestibule to The Book

3. Roles of proof selection

1.      Minimal conditions:

i.     Correctness of the proof

ii.     Correct form and style

iii.     wiki-compatibility

iv.     MSC is given

v.     Level is given (K4, undergrad, graduate, advanced or others…?)

2.      Nomination at least by two proposers (independent from the author and entry editor)

a.      Independence means not from the same institute

b.      Independence means no coauthorship

c.      Independence means no math genealogical direct link (mentor, supervisor, stundent…?)

d.      Independence is declaired by the proposer and normally not verified.  In case of suspicious proposal administrators and or editors vote. 

3.      After the nomination for a longer period (say X years, I propose 5) votes are collected, visits are counted on proof pages.  Each year the top Y (I propose 5%) percentage of the proofs reaching the age of Y year in the repository the proofs are labeled as candidates.

4.      Candidates which has not essentially modified and no objection aroused after another Z years, ( I propose 5) get another short intensive poll period.  Votes are collected, visits are counted on proof pages and the proof is moved to the permanent Book if gets P (say 90%) percentage positive votes    [[User:Telcs|Telcs]] ([[User talk:Telcs|talk]]) 19:00, 30 March 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Why Blender?===

Blender is an incredible free software program, and puts animating and 3d modeling capabilities within the reach of those that would otherwise not be able to afford expensive game making software like Maya, or 3DS Max. Moreover, as proven with the release of '[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo_Frankie! Yo Frankie]!' Blender is a formidable game making program in its own right.

Unfortunately, very few of the available books, tutorials, etc. on Blender seem to be specific to the program's game making abilities. The purpose of this book is not to compete with existing blender wikibooks such as ''[[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro|Blender 3D: Noob To Pro]]'' despite the similarity of any content. The reason I am starting this book is to fill in the blanks left by other resources pertinent specifically to the making of games. In my life, I am a game making student and I am very much learning the ropes of the industry. I make no pretense about being an expert on Blender or game making in general, however it is my hope that other wikibook contributors will be instrumental in helping to expand this book and that my own knowledge will improve in the process.

I will add to this book as and when I have time. In the following sections I've listed the topics which I feel should be covered. If you have knowledge regarding any of these, contributions are always welcomed. If I feel something can be improved I may alter it, or I may delete anything i think is out of place or irrelevant however.

Writing code is my weakness so contributions to Python scripting are especially welcomed!

      <text xml:space="preserve">The E.S shell simplifies the process of creating a knowledge base. It is the shell that actually processes the information entered by a user relates it to the concepts contained in the knowledge base and provides an assessment or solution for a particular problem. Thus E.S shell provides a layer between the user interface and the computer O.S to manage the input and output of the data. It also manipulates the information provided by the user in conjunction with the knowledge base to arrive at a particular conclusion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{LaTeX/Top}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
{{mergeto|LaTeX/Bibliography Management}}

This is a gentle introduction to using some of the bibliography functionality available to LaTeX users beyond the BibTeX basics.  This introduction won't be discussing how to create new styles or packages but rather how to use some existing ones.
It is worth noting that ''Harvard'', for example, is a ''citation'' style.  It is associated with an alphabetical reference list secondarily ordered on date, but the only strictly defined element of ''Harvard'' style is the citation in ''author-date'' format.

==The example data==
The database used for my examples contains just the following
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
@article{Erdos65,
	title = {Some very hard sums},
	journal={Difficult Maths Today},
	author={Paul Erd\H{o}s and Arend Heyting and Luitzen Egbertus Brouwer},
	year={1930},
	pages={30}
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==The limits of BibTeX styles==
Using cite.sty and BibTeX makes it very easy to produce '''some''' bibliography styles.  But ''author-date'' styles - for example the often mentioned, never defined &quot;Harvard&quot; - are not so easy.  It's true that you can download some ''.bst'' files from CTAN that will handle some variants but using them is not always straightforward.
This guide deals with ''Natbib'' a supplementary package that can access ''.bib'' files and has sophisticated functionality for producing custom or default author-year format citations and bibliographies as well as the numerical styles handled by BibTeX.

==Natbib==
Natbib is a package created by Patrick Daly as a replacement for the ''cite.sty'' package when ''author-date'' citation styles are required.  Natbib provides three associated bibliography styles:
* plainnat 
* abbrvnat
* unsrtnat
which correspond to the three styles available by default in BibTeX where you have a plain numbered style, an abbreviated numbered style and an unsorted numbered style.
Alongside these new styles is an extended set of citation commands to provide flexible citation formats.  These are &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\citet[]{}&lt;/source&gt; and &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\citep[]{}&lt;/source&gt; each of which has a number of variants.
===The Preamble===
All Natbib styles require that you load the package in your document preamble.  So, a skeleton LaTeX file with Natbib might look like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\documentclass[]{article}
\usepackage[round]{natbib}

\begin{document}

Document body text with citations.

\bibliographystyle{plainnat}
\bibliography{myrefs}

\end{document}
&lt;/source&gt;
====Options====
Options available with Natbib can be specified in the brackets on the \usepackage command.  Among them are:
{|
|-
! width=&quot;100&quot;|Option 
! width-&quot;100&quot;|Effect
|-
| round || ()
|-
| square || []
|-
| curly || {}
|-
| angle|| &lt;&gt;
|-
| semicolon|| separate citations with ''''';'''''
|-
| colon || as semicolon
|-
| comma || separate with commas
|-
| authoryear || author-year citations
|-
| numbers || numeric citations
|-
| super|| superscript citations
|-
| sort || multiple citations are ordered as in bibliography
|-
|sort&amp;compress||as '''''sort''''' but number ranges are compressed and hyphenated
|-
|compress||number ranges are compressed and hyphenated but only where the 'natural' sort produces a continuous range
|-
|longnamesfirst||first citation is full author list and subsequent citations are abbreviated
|-
|sectionbib||allows multiple bibliographies in the same document
|-
|nonamebreak||forces all author names onto one line
|-
|merge||merges a citation with a previous citation
|-
|elide||elides any repeated elements in merged references
|-
|mcite||ignore merge
|}
Clearly some of these options require explanation but that will be achieved via examples below.  For now, we just note that they can be passed through ''\usepackage[]{}'' in the preamble of your LaTeX file.

==Citation==
===Basic Citation Commands===
&lt;!-- 
basic: &quot;cite&quot;, &quot;citet&quot;, &quot;citep&quot; - done;
advanced: &quot;citealt&quot;, &quot;citealp&quot;, &quot;citeauthor&quot;, &quot;citeyear&quot;, &quot;citeyearpar&quot;,
&quot;citefullauthor&quot;, &quot;Citet&quot;, &quot;Citep&quot;, &quot;Citealt&quot;, &quot;Citealp&quot;, &quot;Citeauthor&quot; - todo.
--&gt;
To cite with Natbib, use the commands ''\citet'' or ''\citep'' in your document.  The &quot;plain&quot; versions of these commands produced abbreviated lists in the case of multiple authors but both have ''*'' variants which result in full author listings.  We assume the use of the ''round'' option in these examples.
====\citet and \citet*====
The ''\citet'' command is used for ''textual'' citations, that is to say that author names appear in the text outside of the parenthetical reference to the date of publication.  This command can take options for chapter, page numbers etc. Here are examples
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\citet{Erdos65}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;produces&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Erdős et al. (1965)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\citet[chapter 2]{Erdos65}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;produces&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Erdős et al. (1965, chapter 2)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\citet[pp. 10-12]{Erdos65}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;produces&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Erdős et al. (1965, pp. 10-12)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\citet[see][chap. 2]{Erdos65}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;produces&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Erdős et al. (see 1965, chap. 2)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
Here are the ''\citet*'' versions
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\citet*{Erdos65}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;produces&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Erdős, Heyting and Brouwer (1965)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\citet*[chapter 2]{Erdos65}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;produces&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Erdős , Heyting and Brouwer (1965, chapter 2)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\citet*[pp. 10-12]{Erdos65}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;produces&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Erdős , Heyting and Brouwer (1965, pp. 10-12)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\citet*[see][chap. 2]{Erdos65}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;produces&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Erdős , Heyting and Brouwer (see 1965, chap. 2)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

====\citep and \citep*====
The ''\citep'' command is used where the author name is to appear inside the parentheses alongside the date.
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\citep{Erdos65}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;produces&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;(Erdős et al. 1965)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\citep[chapter 2]{Erdos65}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;produces&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;(Erdős et al. 1965, chapter 2)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\citep[pp. 10-12]{Erdos65}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;produces&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;(Erdős et al. 1965, pp. 10-12)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\citep[see][chap. 2]{Erdos65}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;produces&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;(see Erdős et al., 1965, chap. 2)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\citep[e.g.][]{Erdos65}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;produces&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;(e.g. Erdős et al., 1965)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
Here are the ''\citep*'' versions
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\citep*{Erdos65}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;produces&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;(Erdős, Heyting and Brouwer 1965)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\citep*[chapter 2]{Erdos65}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;produces&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;(Erdős, Heyting and Brouwer 1965, chapter 2)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\citep*[pp. 10-12]{Erdos65}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;produces&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;(Erdős , Heyting and Brouwer 1965, pp. 10-12)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\citep*[see][chap. 2]{Erdos65}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;produces&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;(see Erdős , Heyting and Brouwer, 1965, chap. 2)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\citep*[e.g.][]{Erdos65}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;produces&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;(e.g. Erdős , Heyting and Brouwer, 1965)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

===The Reference List===
Having dealt with basic varieties of citation, we turn to the creation of the bibliography or reference list.
Inserting a correct and correctly formatted bibliography when using Natbib is no different than when using plain BibTeX.  There are two essential commands - &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\bibliography{mybibliographydatabase}&lt;/source&gt; which LaTeX interprets as an instruction to read a bibliographic database file (eg myrefs.bib) and insert the relevant data here, and &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\bibliographystyle{plainnat}&lt;/source&gt; which specifies how the data are to be presented.
Above the three basic Natbib styles were mentioned as analogues of the partially homonymous styles in BibTeX.  Let us imagine documents bearing citations as in [[#Citation|the section about citation above]].  Here is, approximately, how these citations would appear in plainnat.
[[Image:Plainnatrefs2.png|upright=0.3|]]

===What more is there?===
This covers the basic functionality provided by the package Natbib.  It may not, ofcourse, provide what you are looking for.  If you don't find what you want here then you should probably next investigate ''harvard.sty'' which provides a slighly different set of author-date citation functions.  Providing a gentle guide to ''harvard.sty'' is my next rainy day project.

      <comment>pointed out that aptitude is now apt-get with Ubuntu</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This document assumes that you are familiar with, and not afraid of using a [[Linux Guide/Using the shell|command shell]].

[[/Simpler instructions for creating a live USB stick if you already have one/]]

'''BACK-UP YOUR DATA!''' We do not recommend working on a hdd, or a usb drive, that has important data on it without keeping another copy somewhere else. We can not, and will not ever, assume responsibility, implied or expressed, for any loss of data incurred using this guide. Again, back-up your data Luke!

This guide assumes that you have a working Puredyne CD or DVD (or a running virtualisation image, e.g. using qemu '''FIXME-does this work??''') from which you can create the USB stick. You can create working devices from other gnu/linux distros too, using these instructions.

==Creating a USB bootable drive using make-live-device.sh==

===Summary of steps===

# Download and install dependencies: bzr (bazaar), grub2 and (g)parted. ''(If you're running Puredyne these are already installed.)''
# Check out bouilloncube source code from launchpad&lt;!-- (again for those who do not use a working Puredyne CD/DVD) --&gt;.
# Download the DVD (or CD) iso image from one of the Puredyne mirrors. Refer to the [[Puredyne/Getting Puredyne]] page for ways to do that.
# Plug in the USB stick, find out which device file to use and run the make-live-device.sh script (using sudo).

===In detail===

'''Note:''' if you are creating a stick from a running Puredyne system you already have the script installed, but at the moment it's a good idea to follow all of these steps so that you have the '''latest''' version of the script.

# Installing all necessary dependencies to run the make-live-device.sh script strongly depends on which distribution of GNU/Linux you are using. In Debian-based systems (such as Debian, Ubuntu, or Puredyne) you can just open a terminal and type:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;sudo aptitude install bzr grub2 parted&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Update: as of Ubuntu 10.10+ aptitude is no longer included with Ubuntu. Use apt-get.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other flavours of GNU/Linux, for instance like gentoo you have to use their respective package management tools to install these programs. Here's an example for gentoo: &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;sudo emerge bzr parted grub2&lt;/source&gt;
# To check out the source code of bouilloncube (including make-live-device.sh) type this in a terminal:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;bzr branch lp:bouilloncube&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will create a directory called ''bouilloncube'' in your home directory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
# Download the DVD or CD iso image from from one of the Puredyne mirrors closest to you. You can get detailed instructions to do this [[Puredyne/Getting Puredyne| here]], for one example for downloading the iso from the Puredyne main mirror using rsync type this in a terminal window:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;rsync -P rsync.goto10.org::puredyne-pub/&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will give you a directory listing of all releases on our rsync server, as well as an empty entry as a pointer to the newest release (currently &quot;LATEST_IS_CARROT_AND_CORIANDER&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To download the lastest DVD release type:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;rsync -P rsync.goto10.org::puredyne-pub/carrot_and_coriander/puredyne-911-carrot_and_coriander-DVD-amd64.iso puredyne-911-carrot_and_coriander-DVD-amd64.iso&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''TIP:''' if you already have a DVD or CD iso on your hard disk you can rsync ''over'' it (and thus save quite a lot of download bandwidth) by substituting the second argument to rsync with a path to your stored iso image.
# Now plug in the USB pen drive or USB-HDD to your computer and open a terminal. Wait for a couple of seconds until the device has settled and type: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;dmesg&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will show you something like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[Image:Puredyne-dev-sdb.png]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the highlighted line (and in fact the line above that even clearer) you can see what the device file identifier is for the USB device you have just plugged in, and how many partitions are on it already. In this case there are two partitions on /dev/sdb already, /dev/sdb1 and /dev/sdb2 - make sure you have all data on these partitions backed up, as they will be wiped off the drive completely. '''All data will be lost!'''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''Tip:''' you can use the very great ''rdiff-backup'' tool to create, maintain and restore timestamped backups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, run the make-live-device.sh script. If you are not using Puredyne to create the stick you have to go into the bouilloncube directory checked out from bazaar earlier:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cd /path/to/bouilloncube/sh/grub2&lt;/source&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Then, or if you are already running a Puredyne system you can run the command like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;sudo ./make-live-device.sh /path/to/puredyne-911-carrot_and_coriander-DVD-amd64.iso /dev/sdX&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''Make sure that''' you substitute /dev/sdX for the device you see when running dmesg, as noted above. Failure to do so can result in damaged/overwritten data on hard disk drives, so be careful! Replace the .iso filename if you downloaded the CD or the i386 version of Puredyne. &lt;br&gt;The script will prompt you whether the selected device is correct, so answer this accordingly. After the script is finished you can unplug the device or reboot your computer straight into it.

==Creating a USB bootable drive manually==

'''FIXME-FIXME-FIXME-FIXME-FIXME-FIXME'''

# Make sure the .iso file you downloaded is available on the file system of the machine where you're going to prepare the USB stick. It's OK if it's a Mac or NTFS partition -- puredyne can mount them.
# Boot from the disk. (Or, if you have a virtual-machine app, you could boot right from the iso.)
# Open an xterm window (terminal icon near lower left), then mount the location of the iso. It might take some trial and error to find out which device to mount. Hard disks and USB drives attached to the system are under /dev/sd(a,b,c...), with a number suffix for partitions. The partition editor gparted can help you find the device ID by size (but note, DON'T make any changes with gparted!):

&lt;pre&gt;
gksudo gparted
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then use the drop-down menu at top right to look for the volume that's the same size as the iso location. For instance, on a machine with a 120GB hard drive, /dev/sda shows 111.79 GB and /dev/sdb shows 3.77 GB -- so obviously sda is the built-in hard drive and sdb is the memory stick. sda1 is the HD's first partition; sda2 is the second and so on.

Also, while in gparted, look for the device ID for the USB stick that you're going to prepare.

Once you know that, do this, including the partition number.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo mkdir /media/iso
sudo mount /dev/[name] /media/iso
&lt;/pre&gt;

e.g.:
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/iso
&lt;/pre&gt;

If it's a Windows partition, you might need to specify filesystem type:

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/[name] /media/iso
&lt;/pre&gt;

4. The rest is easy. Use &quot;CD&quot; or &quot;DVD&quot; depending on which you downloaded and replace &quot;path/to&quot; with the real iso location.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo make-live-device.sh /media/iso/path/to/puredyne-910-carrot_and_coriander-DVD.iso /dev/sd#
&lt;/pre&gt;

(where # is the letter of the target USB stick -- '''don't include the partition suffix!''' Write sdc rather than sdc1.)

It'll take a few minutes, but then you'll have a persistent live bootable stick. It will make a smaller partition at the beginning for the iso contents and then use the rest of the stick to save any files that you changed or added later. So it's a good idea to get a stick with more space than you will actually need for the iso.

*** This will not work for me!!! When grub tries to load I get -no module name found-
I am worn out trying to make this work. Apparently there is a bug in grub2.
I would like to try this on my netbook but oh well...
Any ideas around this?

==Creating a USB bootable drive using unetbootin ==

Get unetbootin for Linux from http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/ and a Puredyne iso file from http://puredyne.org/download.html .  
On some distro's you may need to give unetbootin permission to run as a program.  

Use a partitioning tool to create two ext2 partitions on your keypen.  

The first should be 1.5 GB in size to hold Puredyne &amp; should be bootable.  

The second can use the remaining space on the drive and should be given the label live-rw (lower case, as typed).  Puredyne will detect this and use it to store any changes you make.

Plug in the keypen &amp; then use either &lt;code&gt; mount &lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt; dmesg &lt;/code&gt; at a terminal to get the name of the first partiton on the keypen.

Start unetbootin.  Choose the 'Diskimage' option &amp; click the box with three dots to get the file browser &amp; choose the Puredyne iso. Check to make sure that the correct drive (the first on your keypen) is chosen. Click OK &amp; wait for the message that will tell the process is completed.

The first boot will be slower than subsequent boots.</text>

==Booting Puredyne from a USB stick==

# Insert the USB stick into your computer and turn it on.
# Most computers will '''not automatically''' boot from the USB stick. If your computer does not, you need to change a setting in your computer's BIOS. Most PCs allow you to enter the BIOS settings quickly after you start your computer. You are usually prompted to press F1, F12 or F2 to enter the BIOS (check your computers manual if no information is displayed at boot). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[Image:Puredyne-bios-02.jpg]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you entered the BIOS settings, look for the Boot Sequence page. You should change the sequence so that the USB pen drive is first in the list, the hard disk and CD-ROM/DVD drive later. It differs per computer how this is done, please check the manual of your computer if you are unsure how to change these settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[Image:Puredyne-bios-03.jpg]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, some machines' BIOS offer a ''quick boot device'' selection menu like this during startup when pressing F12:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[Image:Puredyne-bios-04.jpg]]
# After changing the boot options in your computers BIOS make sure to save the settings and reboot your machine.
# Once your computer has restarted you should be greeted with a boot menu. Press enter to begin booting Puredyne.

'''The Man With Leprosy'''

1When he came down from the mountainside, large crowds followed him. 2A man with leprosy came and knelt before him and said, &quot;Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.&quot;3Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. &quot;I am willing,&quot; he said. &quot;Be clean!&quot; Immediately he was cured of his leprosy. 4Then Jesus said to him, &quot;See that you don't tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.&quot;

'''The Faith of the Centurion'''

5When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help. 
6&quot;Lord,&quot; he said, &quot;my servant lies at home paralyzed and in terrible suffering.&quot;7Jesus said to him, &quot;I will go and heal him.&quot;
8The centurion replied, &quot;Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed. 9For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.&quot;
10When Jesus heard this, he was astonished and said to those following him, &quot;I tell you the truth, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith. 11I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. 12But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&quot;
13Then Jesus said to the centurion, &quot;Go! It will be done just as you believed it would.&quot; And his servant was healed at that very hour.

'''Jesus Heals Many'''

14When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever. 
15He touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to wait on him.16When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick. 
17This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:
::&quot;He took up our infirmities
:::and carried our diseases.&quot;

'''The Cost of Following Jesus'''

18When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake. 
19Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, &quot;Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.&quot;20Jesus replied, &quot;Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.&quot;
21Another disciple said to him, &quot;Lord, first let me go and bury my father.&quot;
22But Jesus told him, &quot;Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.&quot;

'''Jesus Calms the Storm'''

23Then he got into the boat and his disciples followed him. 
24Without warning, a furious storm came up on the lake, so that the waves swept over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping. 25The disciples went and woke him, saying, &quot;Lord, save us! We're going to drown!&quot;
26He replied, &quot;You of little faith, why are you so afraid?&quot; Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm.27The men were amazed and asked, &quot;What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!&quot;

'''The Healing of Two Demon-possessed Men'''

28When he arrived at the other side in the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him. They were so violent that no one could pass that way. 
29&quot;What do you want with us, Son of God?&quot; they shouted. &quot;Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time?&quot;30Some distance from them a large herd of pigs was feeding. 31The demons begged Jesus, &quot;If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.&quot;32He said to them, &quot;Go!&quot; So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the water. 33Those tending the pigs ran off, went into the town and reported all this, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men. 34Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they pleaded with him to leave their region.

==&lt;big&gt;Context==

----

'''Author'''

The fathers of the early church all agreed that the author of Matthew was Matthew. Matthew was one of the twelve apostles and before he meet Jesus was a tax collector. Matthew does fellow the way that Mark (who is not an eyewitness) does his book, but Matthew does his own arrangement and focuses more on the authority of Jesus. Matthew also emphasizes more on what is going on in the story than just the story its self. In the story about Jesus calming the storm Matthew focuses more on the Christology and keeps the focus of the story on the power of Jesus. Some Biblical researchers say that one reason why Matthew is following what Mark is doing is to show that Matthew is agreeing with Mark as well as show that the apostolic testimony to Christ was not divided.

'''Time and Place'''

Jesus did a lot of his ministry in Galilee which is in Israel. Jesus also went to Capernaum to do ministry there too. Jesus also crossed the Sea of Galilee to do ministry. We do not know exactly with the book of Mathew was written, but we do know it was written after the book of Mark.

'''Literary'''

It is a narrative. Matthew uses synonymous parallelism, common in the Old Testament, in this chapter. Matthew uses imagery as well as the others. For the story about the calming of the storm Matthew structures the passage as simple and direct plus mixing discipleship and Christology together (Tate 220).

==&lt;big&gt;The Summary of Matthew 8 ==

----

Matthew 8 reports numerous healing miracles of Jesus: the man with leprosy, the Centurion's servant, Peter's mother-in-law and many others. It also reports Jesus' warning of the cost of being his follower, his calming of a storm on the lake of Galilee, and his exorcism of two demon-possessed men. 

This chapter starts with a man that has Leprosy. Then Jesus was walking by and the man called out and asked Jesus to heal him, which Jesus did. This man had a lot of faith, to believe that Jesus that can heal him. There is another man who was a Roman Centurion, who had faith in Jesus to heal his servant at a considerable distance away. Jesus said in verse 10, “I tell you the truth, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.” Jesus was impressed with the Centurion’s faith. The chapter also tells how Jesus went around Galilee healing the sick and the demon-possessed.  

Jesus then tells everyone that in order to follow Jesus you need to be willing to become homeless, and not to worry about burying your family. This means that disciples needed to follow Jesus and to drop everything to do so. 

Then Jesus goes out on a boat with his disciples. A storm comes up and the disciples get scared, but Jesus calming the storm. The disciples should of just dropped everything and trust in Jesus that everything was going to be okay.  
Jesus last healing in the chapter was the two demon-possessed men. In this part we see that even the demons know who Jesus is and obey him. This means that Jesus sent the demons away.

== &lt;big&gt;Paraphrase of Matthew 8 ==

----


'''The Man With Leprosy'''

This one is about a man with leprosy who has faith that Jesus can heal him. Jesus sees that this man has great faith and tells the man to go to the river and dunk his head in the water seven times so he can be healed. The man did that and the leprosy left him. Then Jesus told the man to go to the priest to obey the command by Moses. 

'''The Faith of the Centurion'''

Jesus was on his way to Capernaum when a Centurion cames up and asked Jesus to heal his servant. The servant had been paralyzed and the Centurion knew Jesus could help him without having Jesus come to his house. Jesus told the Centurion that he had great faith. Then, right there Jesus says that the servant was has been healed. When the Centurion went home, his servant was healed.  

'''Jesus Heals Many''' 

This story tells us that Jesus healed a lot of people including Peter's mother-in-law. 

'''The Cost of Following Jesus'''

In this little story a teacher of the law came up to Jesus and wondered what he had to do to be a follower of Jesus. Jesus told him that he would have to be homeless because Jesus is a homeless. 

'''Jesus Calms The Storm'''

Then Jesus went in a boat to go across the lake. Jesus fell asleep and then a big storm came up. The disciples were so scared they woke Jesus hoping that He would save them, Jesus response telling them that they do not need to be afraid they just need to trust in Jesus. After that Jesus stops the wind and the waves by just speaking. The disciples did not know what had just happened.

'''The Healing of Two Demon-possessed Men'''

When Jesus and his disciples went to the other side, there were two demon-possessed men. The demon-possessed men asked Jesus if he was going to hurt them. They also asked if Jesus could casts them(the demons) out into a hard of pigs and have the pigs go into the lake to drown. Then Jesus did. The people who were watching this went into the town and told the town's people what had just happened. The town's people came, saw what happened and then asks Jesus to leave.

The greetings in Pizzonese are pretty simple, but are different depending on your location (Italy vs. Americas), but they are not as complex and are similar to those of Neapolitan proper.

This template can be used to display Java code with syntax highlighting and a nice looking frame.
==Usage==
&lt;pre&gt;
{{java|code=}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Example==

&lt;pre&gt;
{{java|code=
for(int i=0; i&lt;10; i++) {
    System.out.println(&quot;Hello!&quot;);
}
}}
&lt;/pre&gt; 

renders as 
{{java|code=
for(int i=0; i&lt;10; i++) {
    System.out.println(&quot;Hello!&quot;);
}
}}

{{Pizzonese}}

For an idea of the Pizzonese verb system, there are a way fewer number of verbs than in Italian, similarly to Neapolitan. The verb for ''to add'', for example, is the same for ''to put'' (méttere), to give an idea of how much simpler it is.

The conjugations though are a bit more numerous and there are just about as much (if not more) irregular verbs as in Italian, with some verb conjugations staying the same from singular first to third person.

Many of these infinitive verb forms are starkly similar to their Italian counterparts, while more than half of all Italian verbs themselves have no respective counterparts in Pizzonese. Frequently though, verbs are &quot;loaned&quot; from Italian and in some cases are added permanently.

These verbs are listed alphabetically, but I will also make another section where they will be listed alphabetically ''and'' according to their ending. My hope is that when you take a look at these verbs, you can see for yourself what I mean. ''La mana de Ddije t’ajute!''

      <comment>initial version describing briefly the steps required to set up a liveUSB for RDEX gallery installation; full walk-through will follow</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">= Setting up a gallery installation =

[http://rdex.goto10.org RDEX] is a gallery installation, one component of which runs from a computer with the video output projected and an internet connection to upload data.  The technical requirements for the installation involve setting up a laptop so that everything starts up automatically when it is turned on, with error recovery in case of unforeseen bugs.

== Create a LiveUSB ==

The usual procedure.

== Configure hardware drivers ==

RDEX needs accelerated OpenGL with hardware shader support, which usually requires installing proprietary drivers.

== User setup ==

Create a new user called '''rdex''' without administration rights for increased security.  The installation will run as this user.

The '''su''' command allows you to switch users, for example '''sudo su rdex'''.  The workflow is to do the set-up logged in as your own user switched to the rdex user in a terminal, as logging in as the rdex user would start the installation.

== Configure displays ==

RDEX runs fullscreen on the external video output of a laptop with its lid shut. Monitor power saving (DPMS) and screen blanking must be disabled.

== Automatic login to custom user ==

As a user with adminstration rights, set up the login manager to automatically log in as the installation's user after a short delay (enough time for a human to log in as a different user when necessary).

== Automatic start of the software ==

Create a shell script to start everything up. Create a desktop file in the autostart folder to launch that script.

Devil's Pie is a handy tool to tweak the window manager settings for applications, in this case to move the RDEX output window to the external output, remove window manager decorations, and maximize it to full screen.

The script runs a loop that restarts the installation in case the custom software crashes.

== Testing ==

Once everything is prepared, make a backup of the key with dd.  Then try rebooting and see if it all works.  If everything is set up correctly, revert to the pristine image, and save it for the opening ceremony.  Otherwise fix the problems and repeat the process.

== Remote debugging ==

OpenVPN can be used to access machines that are behind NAT barriers.  SSH through the VPN to inspect the system.  The output of the autostart script will be logged in the xsession-errors file.  In RDEX's case, if it is working correctly there'll be new messages quite often, so '''tail -f''' for realtime updates.

== Meta ==

This page will be updated with a complete step by step guide soon.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Live music from a netbook (synths, FX, etc)==

I was using ubuntu on a netbook, really convenient for gigging since it's so small. By default ubuntu is not set up great for realtime-audio or the tiny screen, so I managed to customise it but never managed to get it completely working the way it should. (I tried a few others like ubuntu studio and 64studio too.) Puredyne seems to have fixed pretty much everything I needed - not just the low-latency audio but the slimmed down OS, the selection of software, etc.

I usually use '''SuperCollider''' to perform live, with microphone input through a USB audio card, and then various synth sounds and effects from SuperCollider.

[[Image:Mcld_codebox_1.jpg|300px]]

I didn't need to do much tweaking to get the live setup working, since the USB sound card worked straight off. I used synaptic to install a few extra programs (such as transset and xcompmgr which allow semi-transparent windows, nice).

'''JACK''' is the audio infrastructure, either launched from a script or from the '''JACK Control''' program in the menu. The microphone input is straightforward, plug it into my USB soundcard, and make sure the JACK options are set so that it talks to the USB soundcard rather than the built-in one (named &quot;hw1,1&quot; rather than &quot;hw0,0&quot;).

I also use '''Processing''' sometimes for live graphics, and '''Audacity''' to edit recordings...

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Shell Scripting==

''This guideline is heavily inspired from the [http://live.debian.net/manual/html/coding-style.html Debian Live Coding Style].''

===Compatibility===
* Don't use syntax or semantics that are unique to the Bash shell. For example, the use of array constructs.
* Only use the POSIX subset - for example, use &lt;code&gt;$(foo)&lt;/code&gt; over &lt;code&gt;`foo`&lt;/code&gt;.
* You can check your scripts with 'sh -n' and 'checkbashisms'

===Indenting===
* Always use tabs over spaces.

===Wrapping===
* Generally, lines are 80 chars at maximum.
* Use the &quot;Linux style&quot; of line breaks: 
  &lt;source lang=bash&gt;
  # Bad:
  if foo; then
      bar
  fi

  # Good:
  if foo
  then
      bar
  fi&lt;/source&gt;
* The same holds for functions:
  &lt;source lang=bash&gt;
  #Bad:
  foo () {
      bar
  }

  #Good:
  foo ()
  {
      bar
  }&lt;/source&gt;

===Variables===
* Variables are always in capital letters.
* Use braces around variables; eg. write &lt;code&gt;${FOO}&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;$FOO&lt;/code&gt;.
* Always protect variables with respect to potential whitespaces, write &lt;code&gt;&quot;${FOO}&quot;&lt;/code&gt; not &lt;code&gt;${FOO}&lt;/code&gt;.
* For consistency reasons, always use quotes when assigning values to variables: 
  &lt;source lang=bash&gt;
  #Bad:
  FOO=bar

  #Good:
  FOO=&quot;bar&quot;&lt;/source&gt;
* If multiple variables are used, quote the full expression:
  &lt;source lang=bash&gt;
  #Bad:
  if [ -f &quot;${FOO}&quot;/foo/&quot;${BAR}&quot;/bar ]
  then
      foobar
  fi

  #Good:
  if [ -f &quot;${FOO}/foo/${BAR}/bar&quot; ]
  then
      foobar
  fi&lt;/source&gt;

===Miscellaneous===
* Use &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; as a seperator in calls to sed, e.g. &lt;code&gt;sed -e 's|foo|bar|'&lt;/code&gt;.
* Don't use the test command for comparisons or tests, use &lt;code&gt;[ ]&lt;/code&gt;, e.g. &lt;code&gt;if [ -x /bin/foo ]; ...&lt;/code&gt; and not &lt;code&gt;if test -x /bin/foo; ...&lt;/code&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter aims to familiarize the reader with the basic classes and functions of the PyGTK module, and how to link them together.  To start off, open an interactive Python shell (i.e. launch IDLE, or type `python` on the command line of a terminal), and enter the following (case matters):

{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px #999999; background-colour: #22HH9D; padding: 5px; margin:10px;&quot;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot; line&gt;
import gtk

window = gtk.Window()
label = gtk.Label(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)

window.add(label)

window.show_all()
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

If you enter the above code into a file and execute that file (by invoking the interpreter with the file as an argument or indirectly through some other IDE's) then it could happen that nothing seems to happen at all. This is because after the window.show_all() call the interpreter (and thus also the PyGTK application) is terminating. In order for this example to work in this context it is sufficient to append gtk.main(), see the Signals and Callbacks section for more detail.

{{technote|A bug in some versions of PyGTK causes IDLE to crash when using the `gtk` module.  If you launch IDLE, start entering the lines above, and suddenly the IDLE window closes or disappears - usually when you hit [Enter] at the end of one of the lines - then you've been bitten by the bug!  Open a command shell/terminal, type the &quot;python&quot; command, hit [Enter], and start the above script again.}}

This snippet of code creates a window with the text &quot;Hello, world!&quot; inside (see screenshot).
[[File:Screenshot-pygtkbasic.png|center]]

* Line 1: This imports the gtk library so we can access the classes and functions required to build the GUI.
* Line 3: A new Window object is created and assigned to the variable '''window'''.  Note that, by default, this does not immediately show the window on the screen - this is conventionally done after all the widgets have been added to the window.
* Line 4: A new '''gtk.Label''' widget is created.  The first argument is the string to display in the label.
* Line 6: The add() method of the Window is one way of attaching the widget to it.
* Line 8: The show_all() method of the Window class calls the show() method on all its child widgets (the widgets that have been placed inside the window), and then on the containing window itself.

== GTK Objects and Containers ==

[[File:Pygtk objects.svg|right]]
In the example code above, the '''gtk.Window()''' object self-evidently represents the GUI window, and the widget '''gtk.Label''' is added to the object with the '''add()''' method.  The add method, however, only allows a single object to be added to the window.  Since you often want to put multiple widgets into a window, some sort of container object, such as '''gtk.VBox''', needs to be added instead.  The '''gtk.VBox''' object can contain and organize multiple widgets into a '''V'''ertical column.  Similarly, the '''gtk.HBox''' object is also available, organizing  its child widgets into a '''H'''orizontal row.  To create more sophisticated layouts, you can nest the container objects, i.e. have a '''gtk.HBox''' inside a '''gtk.VBox'''.

The use of these objects is demonstrated in the illustration on the right.  The '''gtk.WindowGroup''' object is optional, but allows your application to display more than one gtk.Window.  The chapter 'Multiple Windows' explains how to use this; for now, we will stick to a single window.
----
Here is an example of a simple PyGTK programme which utilizes the '''gtk.VBox''' and '''gtk.HBox''' objects to put multiple widgets on the screen - try typing this into the interactive Python or IDLE interpreter:

{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px #999999; background-colour: #22HH9D; padding: 5px; margin:10px;&quot;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot; line&gt;
import gtk

window = gtk.Window()
entry = gtk.Entry()
button_ok = gtk.Button(&quot;OK&quot;)
button_cancel = gtk.Button(&quot;Cancel&quot;)

vbox = gtk.VBox()
vbox.pack_start(entry)
hbox = gtk.HBox()
hbox.pack_start(button_ok)
hbox.pack_start(button_cancel)
vbox.pack_start(hbox)

window.add(vbox)
window.show_all()
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

The result of the code above should be a window with an input box and two buttons:

[[File:Pygtk usingcontainers.png|center]]

* Line 3: A new '''gtk.Window''' object is created.
* Line 4: A new '''gtk.Entry''' object is created (the input box).
* Line 5 &amp; 6: Two new '''gtk.Button''' objects are created, with the text as the first argument.
* Line 8: A new '''gtk.VBox''' object is created.  This will later be added to the window, and will contain all the widgets in the window.
* Line 9: The '''.pack_start()''' method on a container adds the widget passed as its first parameter to the beginning of the container (at the top).  Unlike the window's '''.add()''' method, this allows multiple widgets when called more than once.  The '''.pack_end()''' method does the same thing, but start putting objects at the end of the container (at the bottom), so subsequent calls place the widget on top of the previous one.
* Line 10: Another container object is created.
* Line 11 &amp; 12: The button widgets are added to this new hbox container with the '''.pack_start()''' method.
* Line 13: The hbox container is nested inside the vbox container by calling the '''.pack_start()''' method on the vbox container.
* Line 15: The vbox container is added to the window with the window's '''.add()''' method.
* Line 16: All the objects are shown, so you can now see the window on the screen.

== Signals and Callbacks ==

In order to get your application to react to the GUI, you can tap into '''events''' which occur on widgets and tell PyGTK to run a function (known as a '''callback function''') when that event happens.  For example, when the user clicks on a button, the &quot;clicked&quot; event for that specific widget is emitted, and if you have connected it to a callback function that function is run.

To connect an event with a function, call the '''.connect()''' method on the widget that will emit the event.  The syntax of this method is:

 handler_id = widget.connect(event_name, callback_function[, function_data])

The return value to '''.connect()''' can be captured so the connection can be revoked.
* The ''event_name'' argument should be a string representing the name of the event to connect with.  This varies between widgets; i.e. the gtk.Button widget emits a &quot;clicked&quot; event when, erm, clicked on.
* The ''callback_function'' should be a reference to the callback function you want PyGTK to run when ''event_name'' is emitted.  Do not put the brackets () at the end of the name, and it doesn't need to be enclosed as a string.
* The optional ''function_data'' parameter may contain additional arguments to pass to the callback function.

The callback function should be in the form:

 def callback_function(widget, callback_data=None)

The name of the function and its arguments can be called anything.
* The first argument, ''widget'', is a reference to the widget object that emitted the signal.
* The second argument, ''callback_data'', contains the ''callback_data'' specified as the last argument to the widget's connect() method, if supplied.

Finally, to make sure your events are dealt with, add the following code to the end of the application:

 gtk.main()

The '''gtk.main()''' function listens for events and runs any callback functions that have been connected to them.  This function stays running until the window is closed by the operating system's window manager, or '''gtk.main_quit()''' is run.

Below is a modified version of the sample code above, with a some callback functions defined and connected to button events.

{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px #999999; background-colour: #22HH9D; padding: 5px; margin:10px;&quot;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot; line&gt;
import gtk

# Define the callback functions first:
def exit(widget, callback_data=None):
  window.hide_all()
  gtk.main_quit()

window = gtk.Window()
entry = gtk.Entry()
button_ok = gtk.Button(&quot;OK&quot;)
button_cancel = gtk.Button(&quot;Cancel&quot;)

# Connect events to callback functions:
button_cancel.connect(&quot;clicked&quot;, exit)

vbox = gtk.VBox()
vbox.pack_start(entry)
hbox = gtk.HBox()
hbox.pack_start(button_ok)
hbox.pack_start(button_cancel)
vbox.pack_start(hbox)

window.add(vbox)
window.show_all()
# Put gtk.main() last so our callback functions are used.
gtk.main()
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

* Lines 4-6: This a callback function which closes the window with the '''.hide()''' method and stops the '''gtk.main()''' loop.  Although the ''callback_data argument'' is not used, it is often helpful to include it in all the callback functions in case it is needed at some point.
* Line 14: The '''.connect()''' method captures the &quot;clicked&quot; event from the '''button_cancel''' widget and sends it to our '''exit()''' callback function we defined earlier.
* Line 26: The '''gtk.main()''' function starts the '''main loop''' which sends events/signals to the right callback functions.

== Putting It All Together ==

The following code uses all of the methods discussed above to create a very simple GTK application that asks for your name and prints it to the console.  Copy and save the following text in a file and run '''python example.py''' on the command line (replacing example.py with the name of the file you just created).

{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px #999999; background-colour: #22HH9D; padding: 5px; margin:10px;&quot;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot; line&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import pygtk
pygtk.require('2.0')

import gtk


class Application():
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.window = gtk.Window()
        self.window.set_title(&quot;Example GTK Application&quot;)
        
        self.create_widgets()
        self.connect_signals()
        
        self.window.show_all()
        gtk.main()
    
    
    def create_widgets(self):
        self.vbox = gtk.VBox(spacing=10)
        
        self.hbox_1 = gtk.HBox(spacing=10)
        self.label = gtk.Label(&quot;Your Name:&quot;)
        self.hbox_1.pack_start(self.label)
        self.entry = gtk.Entry()
        self.hbox_1.pack_start(self.entry)
        
        self.hbox_2 = gtk.HBox(spacing=10)
        self.button_ok = gtk.Button(&quot;OK&quot;)
        self.hbox_2.pack_start(self.button_ok)
        self.button_exit = gtk.Button(&quot;Exit&quot;)
        self.hbox_2.pack_start(self.button_exit)
        
        self.vbox.pack_start(self.hbox_1)
        self.vbox.pack_start(self.hbox_2)
        
        self.window.add(self.vbox)
    
    
    def connect_signals(self):
        self.button_ok.connect(&quot;clicked&quot;, self.callback_ok)
        self.button_exit.connect(&quot;clicked&quot;, self.callback_exit)
    
    
    def callback_ok(self, widget, callback_data=None):
        name = self.entry.get_text()
        print name
    
    
    def callback_exit(self, widget, callback_data=None):
        gtk.main_quit()
    

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    app = Application()
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

This application is structured inside a single class, '''Application'''.  This approach allows the names of the GTK widgets and other objects to reside in their own namespace, and also makes it possible to import the file in other scripts and let the programmer decide when to create and display the GUI.

* Lines 4 &amp; 5:  These two lines are required above the '''import gtk''' statement.  They deal with all the initialization and version checking that the GTK+ toolkit needs to do before creating your GUI.  Although we have omitted this in our earlier examples, you should still use it in your own programmes to avoid potential redrawing problems.
* Line 12:  The '''__init__()''' method, which is called upon class construction, does the following to setup the application:
** Lines 13 &amp; 14:  Create a '''gtk.Window''' object and use its '''.set_title()''' method to tell GTK what string to display in the window's title bar.
** Line 16:  Run the '''create_widgets()''' method which creates all of the containers and widgets, and packs the widgets inside the right containers.
** Line 17:  Run the '''connect_signals()''' method which connects the &quot;clicked&quot; events on the buttons to a few callback methods.
** Lines 19 &amp; 20:  Recursively shows all the widgets inside the window, then runs the '''gtk.main()''' loop to respond to events.
* Line 49:  This callback method, which is connected to the &quot;clicked&quot; event on our OK button, gets the text from out '''gtk.Entry''' widget with its '''get_text()''' method, and prints it to the console.  Note that the difference between a '''callback function''' and a '''callback method''' (used here) is that the callback method has an additional argument at the beginning, '''self''', because it is defined within a class and is therefore passed the properties and methods of that class by the python interpreter.
* Line 55:  This callback method quits the application by stopping the '''gtk.main()''' loop.  Note that it does not have to run the '''.hide_all()''' method on the window object because the window is destroyed as the application stops running.

While it's pretty unimportant in BASIC, using includes is central to the C language.

In QuickBASIC, files are included like this:
 '$INCLUDE: 'filename.bas'

In C, you do this:
 #include &quot;filename.h&quot;

This works identically to the BASIC version: it looks for filename.h, first in the current directory, and then in the compiler's include directory.

An alternate syntax looks like this:
 #include &lt;filename.h&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction to Linguistic Methodologies=


====Linguistics Uses a Top-Down Approach====

There are two ways in which to study a cognitive phenomenon: top-down and bottom-up. Top-down analysis starts from behavioural and introspective data to give an abstract characterization of cognitive processes. The bottom-up approach starts from the analysis of entities that are smaller in scope and build up to an explanation of the phenomenon. This includes starting with low-level information systems (either in computers or neurons) which to give us information on the basis of cognition. Thus, Linguistics, being a top down-study, creates abstract theories of mind which are then tested by cognitive neuroscientists, cognitive computer scientists, and psycholinguists to see if they may be plausible for cognitive models and theories of mind (MacWhinney,1999, 402-403).


====Why Study Linguistics in Cognitive Science?====

Language use is a cognitive phenomenon that is incredibly complex, and is one of the things that distinguishes humans from other animals. Our language is much more complex than any other known species' forms of communication. Many believe that language plays a large role in human cognition. We learn words at rapid rates, learning about 45,000 words around the time the average person graduates high school. Human brains are specialized for learning language. Our use of and ability to learn language are thus important cognitive phenomena that require study. 

===Data===

There are several legitimate sources of linguistic evidence:
1. The grammatical intuitions of a linguist who is a native speaker of the language in question
2. Data collected in experimental settings from native speakers of the language in question (informants or experimental participants)
3. Transcriptions of actual spoken language (text)

The Three Claims of Text as Evidence.

Linguists have three stances on the acceptability of  written text (transcribed from speech) should be used as data.

The Strong Claim: Texts are the ''only'' evidence in linguistics. 

The Weaker Claim: Texts are the ''best'' evidence in linguistics; (better, in any case, than native speaker's intuitions) 

The Weakest Claim: Texts are ''very good'' evidence in linguistics (Stainton, 1994, 1-18). 

===Methods===

Many Cognitive scientists base models of grammar upon Chomsky's Theory of generative grammar, which explicates that grammar is generative (can create innumerable new sentences) and that the best judgment is a native speakers' as to which sentences are grammatical (Chomsky, 1957). This, along with some spoken languages having no text basis/written language give insight into what most Cognitive Scientists claim. Thus, many linguists dismiss the Strong Claim, are wary of the Weaker Claim, while most find Weakest Claim to be acceptable (Stainton, 1994) .

--It is to be noted that the proper term for one participating in a Linguistic test is an 'informant' : one who is a native speaker ; an authority figure on grammaticality. This term is specific to linguistics. The term participant will be used as well, as a general term for a more person participating in any type of experiment. (This will be done to not over use the term informant.)

 
==Structural Analysis==

The goal of structural analysis is to study the underlying structures and rules of a language. Language is said to have specific rules, which Noam Chomsky defined as a Universal Grammar (UG) (Chomsky, 1957). This being that all languages had universal rules to them. UG states that children learn structure dependent rules. This means that there is an abstract grammar structure for all languages based on hierarchical grouping of words, based on their role in language. All words are grouped into parts of speech: nouns, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives, conjunctions, prepositions and interjections, from then they are hierarchically organized by rules into sentences which form our grammar, or the universal grammar of languages. These analysis of structure in phonology, morphology, and semantics give an abstract structural representation of language which give insight into language formation, acquisition and use, all of which are key aspects of cognition (Frank 460). A large amount of structural analysis is done with texts, mathematics, and grammaticality judgments (see below).

==Functional Analysis==

The goal of functional analysis is “to determine the affects of function, being that forms of natural languages are created, governed, constrained, acquired, and used in the service of communicative functions, on language” (MacWhinney 402-403). 

Some aspects where functional analysis are key:

Cue and form reliability: this means learning cues and forms for specific words ([[topicaztion]]). Wherein, if the cue markers were taken out our switch the sentence would be incomprehensible to the listener. Cue markers are governed by function and can vary from a simple allophones to word order in a sentence (MacWhinney 408). Such as in English, word-order usually distinguish what category the word is in.

Lexical influences on syntax: From the sentence 'Child's Stool is Great for Use in Garden' one is able to interpret it child's feces being great for compost in the garden, or a small stool, typically used by children, is great for kneeling onto when gardening (Pinker 94-95). Two largely different sentence meanings. Yet, based on the structure one interpreted it as, means the difference between harvesting child feces for fertilizer and buying a cheap stool to help your sore back. In order to find which one is grammatical and judge it based on a criteria of how likely it is to be understood a certain way is a type of functional analysis.

Complex grammar paradigms: This is the study of why certain words of language are categorized in certain ways (e.g. Why certain words are masculine or feminine in some languages.) Functional analysts look for cues and forms to predict categories for certain words (MacWhinney 410).

Most of the data used in functional analyzing is from studies of language typology of surveys of lexical patterning (MacWhinney 411).


====Grammaticality Judgments====

Grammaticality tests are given to informants to judge whether something in their idiolect is grammatical. This is the main source of empirical evidence for functional analysts searching to analyze complex grammatical paradigms along with structural analysts to further their studies of grammar. 



==Neurological Methods==

Neurological Methods attempt to localize brain areas with roles in cognition. They are able to correlate damage, experimental changes, abstract cognitive processes, and language to parts of the brain. 

==Deficit Studies==

Deficit Studies are studies that test and naturally observe those with neurological deficits (e.g. lesions, tumours, trauma, mutations) on language centres in the brain. Famous deficit studies include Broca's Area and Wernicke's area (Firth 380-385).

====Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)====

TMS is a technique which apply magnetic forces to certain parts of the brain. This makes a target area of the brain unable to operate properly causing almost temporary controlled lesions.* Which can be studied as if they were deficit studies.

====Transcranial Electric Stimulation (TES)====

TES is the opposite of TMS. It applies electrical forces to certain parts of the brain. This gives the target area a large amount of stimulation. When non-localized parts of the brain are stimulated one is able to see its affects on cognition. 

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)

MRI and fMRI record oxygen levels in the brain. Solutions are added into the brain and then the oxygen is able to be measured. Change in oxygen levels mean change in brain stimulation (Buckner, and Peterson 413-415). The difference between a MRI and fMRI is that the fMRI the participant is doing a task while the measuring is being done. The informant may be asked to read, write, or think about something. A MRI is just a patient sitting still not doing any task.  

====Positron Emission Tomography (PET)====

PET tests indicates increases in blood flow within the brain. A slightly radioactive solution is added to the participants blood and the radioactivity is measured overtime while the blood flows throughout the brain (Buckner, and Peterson 413-415). 

====Electroencephalography (EEG)====

An EEG is a way of mapping electrical communication of neurons in the brain. The machine itself is a hairnet like hat with many nodes on them which measure the spread of electrical activation through the skull. Seeing the spread of electrical communication gives us insight into how the information is being processed on an electrochemical level.

==Psycholinguistics==

The area of psycholinguistics is the study of how humans psychological make sense of, and process a sentence. In the beginning of psycholinguistics, which includes work from Miller, Mckean, and Slobin, informants were tested on their ability to process sentence, the experimental aspect was the transformations in a sentence's derivation the reader had to make (Abrahamsen, Bechtel, and Graham 41-42). What was found was the more transformations the longer time it took for participants to read and understand the sentence.

This was refuted and proven empirically wrong by modern psycholinguistics, including Fodor, Garrett, and Bever, which stated that the relationship held between linguistic performance and competence is more abstract than originally thought (Abrahamsen, Bechtel, and Graham 41-42). This brought upon a paradigm shift in psycholinguistics, straying away from transformations of sentences and into the study how language is internally represented and processed on a psychological level. Psycholinguistics caused computational models for linguistics to emerge, attempting to use computers to represent the internal processes and information being used and transformed in deep structure.

==Computational models of language==

Computational models of language are used to study (a) the study of computational models of the structure and function of language, its use, and it acquisition; and (b) the design, development, and implementation of a wide range of system such as speech recognition, language understanding and natural language generation (Joshi 162). 

====Parsers====

Parsers in computational linguistics refers to computer programs that attempt to parse a language based on certain coded rules (Joshi 163) . This is an attempt to try and re-create the ways in which humans may represent, and manipulate linguistic data, along with how we form rules and grammars. Parsers give us large amounts insight and constraints on our abstract theories of languages and mind. The goal of parsers is to parse only grammatical observations and grade them on a specific criteria. Just as we humans would do with natural language. We only understand somewhat grammatical sentences and if we don't fully understand it we are able to grade it against other more/less grammatical sentences along with sentences that don't make sense at all.

====Statistics====

Statistic data of language from computational a decently new field of study in computational models for language(Joshi 164). This uses corpus data (see below) in order to statistically find regularities in language (e.g. Two words being found beside each other 25% of the time either one of the words is present). This leads to large statistical data about language and from that one is able to form language rules. This along with Behaghel's first law, words that belong together mentally are placed close together syntactically gives insight into mental storage of words (MacWhinney 404).

==Phonology==

The study of the physical aspect of speech (i.e. The sounds made to create speech, more specifically phonemes and allophones). This branch of linguistics has the most empirical evidence for their claims. Phonology does not have a large impact on cognition. Yet, Phonological studies have given good insight to a “critical period” and Chomsky's language acquisition device(Abrahamsen, Becthel, and Graham 41-42 ). Some speakers of one language can differ between two allophones that speakers of another language could not distinguish, even though they both exist in the both their languages. This means we may acquire only some allophones to which we can hear, because the allophones we do not learn may not be an important aspect for distinguishing terms. Therefore, some of our cognition for classifying terms rely on Phonology.


==Output data==

Almost all output data within Linguistics are published in journals, books, or electronic articles.

==Ways of Avoiding Threats to Internal Validity ==

There are many ways to assure, in a Linguistic study involving informants, that you receive reliable and powerful data:
Make informants comfortable. Have breaks every so often and allow them to relax.
Those being questioned may make mistakes or change their mind. When this occurs you may want to rephrase the question or ask it in a different way. Rephrasing difficult or complex questions increases your power in a study. Making sure you were able to draw conclusions where connections actually existed.
Informants have a bias towards 'yes'. So, adding a 'not sure' option will reduce the unreliability of your testings.
Having yourself as an informant is not typically done and is not recommended. You probably hold a bias towards a favoured outcome. This will result in unreliable data.
Using corpus DATA, or a body of data, that many linguistic researchers have used before to test their hypothesis. This is largely used in computational models, when attempting to test the performance of their programs versus others in an objective manner.
Always re-check data, even if the data may disprove your hypothesis. Be thorough in your investigation and be as fair as possible with competing data.

One of the strengths of vim is the possibility of using so called vim-scripts (addons) which can be easily installed by copy-and-pasting them into the aappropriate directory. A selection of scripts can be found on the [http://www.vim.org/scripts/index.php official homepage].

The following scripts can illustrate some of possibilities:

One powerfull external script is the [http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=475 latex-suite]. It supports
* Editing:  Latex-Suite ships with a very comprehensive set of insert mode and visual mode mappings and menu items to typeset most of the LaTeX elements.

* Compiling: You can compile the tex file from within vim. 

* Viewing: By pressing a key from within vim, the .dvi viewer is started up. You can also do forward and inverse searching on your .dvi file from within vim.

* Folding: Latex-suite ships with the plugin SyntaxFolds.vim which is a plugin for creating &quot;fake&quot; syntax folds on the fly. 

* Packages: This module provides ways of customizing the menus based on which packages are being used in the current LaTeX file.

* LaTeX help file: Latex-suite ships with the standard texinfo file translated into vim help format so that you can get help for common latex commands from within vim. 

* Dictionary: Latex-suite ships with a dictionary with over 600 LaTeX commands, which speeds up typing using the CTRL-X_d command of vim.

* Customized Templates: Latex-suite ships with some commonly used latex templates. 

* Customized Macros: Latex-suite makes it easy to add custom macros, again with the possibility of dynamic content and automatic cursor placement.

==Background==
*Very rare
*Commonly presents as a gradually enlarging, firm nodule
*&gt;70% located in the head &amp; neck region, especially periorbital
*Spread is to regional lymph nodes

==Treatment==
Treatment is largely surgical via wide excision or Mohs.  Radiation or topical therapies are sometimes used.

      <comment>/* Separating by 1000s is not culturally neutral */ new section</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

I apologise if I'm out of place here, but I heard about this language being not only logical, but also hexadecimal-happy. Instead, I find neither.

Where is the ease of numbers as in English?

We don't talk about the number two-three, rather twen&lt;u&gt;'''ty'''&lt;/u&gt;-three. We say four&lt;u&gt;'''ty'''&lt;/u&gt;-five, not four-five. Can you imagine trying to do a math problem by adding three-five and six-two instead of thirty-five and sixty-two? It only gets worse if you have larger numbers. 

Think about trying to add three-four-seven to two-five-six. Wouldn't it be easier to add three-hundred-fourty-seven and two-hundred-fifty-six?

Numbers aren't just digits mushed together. They represent concepts, yet the concept of TEN (or sixteen, if we are going to use hexadecimal) just isn't obvious. There is no assumed base in any of these strings of numbers.

And if this is supposed to be a logical language, why are the last six digit names so much different than the first ones? Aim to INCLUDE hex numbers, not just add them on.

I look forward to your response,

WesT

== Separating by 1000s is not culturally neutral ==

I find it interesting that despite Lojban's apparent goal in being culturally neutral, it has adopted a very Eurocentric approach of separating numbers in groups of 1,000.  In China and Japan (and maybe other places, those two are just conveniently at the top of my mind), the number system uses groupings of 10,000 (I guess it would be better to write it as 1,0000?)  So someone from there trying to learn the numeric system would have all the same difficulty they would have in learning it for English.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Qualitative Research ==

Qualitative research is collection of research methods that collect verbal or text data in order to answer sociological questions. This kind of research looks at processes and explanations in answering these questions.

Three qualitative methods include:
# content analysis
# interviews
# field research

=== Field research ===

Field research is the systematic observation of people in a natural setting for an extended period of time. This research has its origins in investigative journalism and cultural anthropology.

'''Topics appropriate for field research'''
* Topics that defy simple quantification
* Attitudes and behaviors best understood in their natural settings
* Social processes over time

'''Elements of social life appropriate for field research'''
* Practices
* Episodes
* Encounters
* Roles and Social Types
* Social and Personal Relationships
* Groups and Cliques
* Organizations
* Settlements and Habitats
* Social Worlds
* Subcultures and Lifestyles

'''Potential problems''' 
* Bias - both experimenter bias and participant bias
* Reactivity - a related idea in which subjects alter their behavior as a response to the knowledge that they are being studied
* Possibility of the experimenter &quot;going native&quot; or becoming part of the culture they are studying
* Some subjects may not consent to being observed

'''Strengths and Weaknesses of Qualitative Field Research'''

--Strengths:
# effectiveness for studying subtle nuances in attitudes and behaviors and social processes over time
# flexibility
# inexpensiveness

-Weaknesses:
# no appropriate statistical analyses
# reliability (because this research is not easy to replicate)
# validity

Types of validity include...

* ECOLOGICAL VALIDITY is the degree to which the researcher’s construction of the field site corresponds to the subjects’ own conception of it
* NATURAL HISTORY VALIDITY is the degree to which outsiders other than the researcher accept that the methods used by the researcher are valid
* MEMBER VALIDITY is the degree to which subjects confirm the accuracy and fairness of the researcher’s field notes
* COMPETENT INSIDER PERFORMANCE VALIDITY is the degree to which the researcher has been accepted into the social world of the field site


=== Qualitative Field Research Paridigms ===

* ''Naturalism'' - an approach to field research based on the assumption that an objective social reality exists and can be observed and reported accurately

* ''Institutional Ethnography'' - a research technique in which the personal experiences of individuals are used to reveal power relationships and other characteristics of the institution within which they operate. It links the microlevel of everyday personal experiences with the macrolevel of institutions. The level of analysis in this paradigm is culture.  It does this through ''explicit knowledge'', ''tacit knowledge'', and ''thick description''.

* ''Ethnomethodology'' - an approach to the study of social life that focuses on the discovery of implicit, usually unspoken, assumptions and agreement. This paradigm usually focuses on &quot;breaking the rules&quot; as well as finding and analyzing &quot;what everyone knows&quot;. The units of analysis typically include words, gestures, and body language and are typically studied through ''breeching experiments''.

* ''Breeching Experiment''- an experiment in which the researcher breaks tacit social norms in order to test people's reactions.

* ''Grounded Theory'' - an inductive approach to the study of social life that attempts to generate a theory from the constant comparing of unfolding observations. The guidelines for this paradigm include thinking conservatively, obtaining multiple viewpoints, periodically stepping back, maintaining an attitude of skepticism, and following the research procedures.

* ''Case Studies'' - the in-depth examination of a single instance of some social phenomenon

* ''Extended case method'' - a technique in which case study observations are used to discover flaws in and to improve existing social theories

* ''Participatory Action Research'' - an approach to social research in which the people being studied are given control over the purpose and procedures of the research

* ''Emancipatory Research'' - research conducted for the purpose of benefiting disadvantaged groups.

=== Conducting Qualitative Field Research ===

* Prepare for the field

In preparing for field research, most methodologists suggest selecting a site where the researcher is a stranger. This ensures a more balanced perspective. However, it can be difficult for researchers to obtain access to such sites. Situations in which the researcher is an insider or is perceived as a member of the same general community can also be helpful.
Sometimes, obtaining access to a site may be facilitated by obtaining the interest and trust of a gatekeeper, who may have formal or informal authority. Personal connections are often especially important when deviant or elite populations are being studied. Personal connections can even play a role in every-day situations, aiding the researcher in transforming “access” into “acceptance.”

A few important steps in preparation for field research:
* Be familiar with relevant research
* Discuss your plans with others in the area
* Identify and meet informants (when appropriate)
* Make good first impressions, as these are important
* Establish rapport, which is an open and trusting relationship

The roles a researcher can take on in field research are defined by the relationship the observer has with the subject. This is because the involvement the research has with the subject will affect how in depth the research is, and it may also incur the observer effect, in which the subject changes his/her behavior based on the knowledge that he/she is being observed. Another way in which the researcher impacts the research is based on his own involvement in the experiment itself; this participatory involvement is defined by how involved the researcher is with the subjects and their behavior throughout the course of the experiment. The researcher can be entirely an outside observer, never interacting directly with the subject, or be entirely in the group and part of the group they are researching, or any level in between these two extremes. Depending on the research and what is being studied, the researcher will decide what level of involvement will be appropriate for the research, and what level of involvement will give the best results and not affect the quality of the data.

* Take into account any ethical considerations

Institutional review boards typically exercise great caution in approving field research studies. While field research is unlikely to harm the subjects, it can be very risky for harming the institution. This is especially true when the research subjects are children.

Observing in public areas is generally accepted but some public areas have special considerations: one are not part of the “public” if the group is homogeneous and he/she is different (woman in an all male group, adult among kids, etc…) Researchers should only take the liberty to &quot;act invisible&quot; and hide their role as a researcher if the behavior they are researching is completely public and completely anonymous, for example, study habits in a library, how people approach one another in a bar, etc. However, a researcher must disclose their researcher role when observing in private locations. 

* Interviewing/Stages in complete interviewing process:
# Thematizing
# Designing
# Interviewing
# Transcribing
# Analyzing
# Verifying
# Reporting




== Qualitative Analysis ==

Qualitative Analysis is the numerical examination and interpretation of observations, for the purpose of discovering underlying meanings and patterns of relationships.  This is most typical of field research and historical research.

=== Link Theory and Analysis ===

'''Discovering Patterns'''

* You must try to find frequencies, magnitudes, structures, processes, causes and consequences.

* ''Cross-Case Analysis'' – an analysis that involves an examination of more than one case; this can be either a variable-oriented analysis

* ''Variable-Oriented Analysis'' – an analysis that describes and/or explains a particular variable

* ''Case-Oriented Analysis'' – an analysis that aims to understand a particular case or several cases by looking closely at the details of each

* ''Ground Theory Method (GTM)'' – an inductive approach to research introduced by Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss in which theories are generated solely from an examination of data rather than being derived deductively

* ''Constant Comparative Method'' – a component of the Grounded Theory Method in which observations are compared with one another and with the evolving inductive theory

Four stages of constant comparative method (Glaser and Strauss):

# Comparing incident application to each category
# Integrating categories and their properties
# Delimiting the theory
# Writing theory

* ''Semiotics'' – the study of signs and the meanings associated with them.  This is commonly associated with content analysis

* ''Conversation Analysis (CA)'' – a meticulous analysis of the details of conversation, based on a complete transcript that includes pauses, hems, and also haws

'''Conceptualization in qualitative analysis'''

In quantitative analysis, it is usually obvious what the variables to be analyzed are, for example, race, gender, income, education, etc. Deciding what is a variable, and how to code each subject on each variable, is more difficult in qualitative data analysis. 

* ''Concept Formation'' - is more sophisticated in qualitative data analysis. Concept formation is the creation of variables (usually called THEMES) out of raw qualitative data. 

* ''Casing'' - the process of determining what represents a case, is an important part of concept formation. CODING is the actual transformation of qualitative data into themes.

'''Coding in qualitative analysis'''

* ''Open Coding'' – the initial classification and labeling of concepts in qualitative data analysis.  In open coding, the codes are suggested by the researchers’ examination and questioning of the data

* ''Axial coding'' – a reanalysis of the results of open coding aimed at identifying the important concepts (themes).

* ''Selective coding'' – this builds on the results of open coding and axial coding to identify the central concept that organizes the other concepts that have been identified in a body of textual materials.

* ''Memoing'' – writing memos that become part of the data for analysis in qualitative research such as grounded theory. Memos can describe and define concepts, deal with methodological issues, or offer initial theoretical formulations. Memos can be thought of as a researcher's diary.

* ''Code memos'' – identify the code labels and their meanings

* ''Theoretical memos'' – reflections on dimensions and deeper meaning of contexts, relationship among contexts, theoretical propositions, etc.

* ''Operational memos'' – deal primarily with methodological issues.

* ''Concept Mapping'' – the graphical display of concepts and their interrelations, useful in the formulation of theory

'''Social network analysis''' 

Social network analysis is a technique to discover, analyze, and display sets of relations among a group. It emerged from the sociometric study of small groups. Examples of groups would be school classes, summer camps, etc. It utilizes a graph (diagraph) for display, and ties between individuals are represented as edges (arcs) in this graph. In order to determine the ties, questions that could be used include: “Whom do you know personally?”, “Who are your best friends?”, “Whom do you most respect?”, “With whom would you most like to be friends?”, etc. Ties are typically represented by 0 or 1, but they can also be given magnitudes. Finally, structurally similar individuals are clustered together.

== Questions for Evaluating the Quality of Qualitative Research ==

* Credibility of the findings

* Ways that the research has extended knowledge or understanding of the subject

* Effectiveness of evaluation in addressing its original aims/purposes

* Explanation of the scope for drawing wider inferences

* Clarity of the basis of evaluative appraisal

* Defensibility of the research design

* Defense of the same design/target selection of cases/documents

* Description of the eventual sample composition and coverage 

* Quality of data collection process

* Clarity of approach to, and formulation of, analysis

* Portrayal and retention of contexts of data sources retained and portrayed

* Exploration of diversity of perspective and content

* Coherence in conveying detail, depth, and complexity of the data 

* Clarity of links between data, interpretation, and conclusions

* Clarity and coherence of reporting

* Clarity of assumptions/theoretical perspectives/values that shape the evaluation's form and output

* Evidence of attention to ethical issues

* Adequacy of documentation of research process

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Matthew 9 ==
''(New International Version)
''

'''Jesus Heals a Paralytic'''

1 Jesus stepped into a boat, crossed over and came to his own town. 2 Some men brought to him a paralytic, lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, &quot;Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven.&quot;

3 At this, some of the teachers of the law said to themselves, &quot;This fellow is blaspheming!&quot;

4 Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, &quot;Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts? 5Which is easier: to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'? 6But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins....&quot; Then he said to the paralytic, &quot;Get up, take your mat and go home.&quot; 7And the man got up and went home. 8When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe; and they praised God, who had given such authority to men.

'''The Calling of Matthew'''

9 As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. &quot;Follow me,&quot; he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him.

10While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew's house, many tax collectors and &quot;sinners&quot; came and ate with him and his disciples. 11When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, &quot;Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?&quot;

12On hearing this, Jesus said, &quot;It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. 13But go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.'[a] For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.&quot;

'''Jesus Questioned About Fasting'''

14Then John's disciples came and asked him, &quot;How is it that we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?&quot;

15Jesus answered, &quot;How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast.

16&quot;No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse. 17Neither do men pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.&quot;

'''A Dead Girl and a Sick Woman'''

18While he was saying this, a ruler came and knelt before him and said, &quot;My daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she will live.&quot; 19Jesus got up and went with him, and so did his disciples.

20Just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak. 21She said to herself, &quot;If I only touch his cloak, I will be healed.&quot;

22Jesus turned and saw her. &quot;Take heart, daughter,&quot; he said, &quot;your faith has healed you.&quot; And the woman was healed from that moment.

23When Jesus entered the ruler's house and saw the flute players and the noisy crowd, 24he said, &quot;Go away. The girl is not dead but asleep.&quot; But they laughed at him. 25After the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up. 26News of this spread through all that region.

'''Jesus Heals the Blind and Mute'''

27As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, &quot;Have mercy on us, Son of David!&quot;

28When he had gone indoors, the blind men came to him, and he asked them, &quot;Do you believe that I am able to do this?&quot;
&quot;Yes, Lord,&quot; they replied.

29Then he touched their eyes and said, &quot;According to your faith will it be done to you&quot;; 30and their sight was restored. Jesus warned them sternly, &quot;See that no one knows about this.&quot; 31But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region.

32While they were going out, a man who was demon-possessed and could not talk was brought to Jesus. 33And when the demon was driven out, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowd was amazed and said, &quot;Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel.&quot;

34But the Pharisees said, &quot;It is by the prince of demons that he drives out demons.&quot;

'''The Workers Are Few'''

35Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness. 36When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. 37Then he said to his disciples, &quot;The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. 38Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.&quot;

: There's already sites such as [http://stackoverflow.com Stack Overflow] that serve as a Q&amp;A.  Also, the existing [[C Programming/Q&amp;A|Q&amp;A for C]] was riddeled with many unanswered questions for a long time, whether they were nonsense questions, homework questions, or questions that could be answered simply by reading the appropriate page in the guide. Furthermore, the people asking questions made no attempt to help others. --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 13:05, 25 March 2010 (UTC)

If nothing else, this book should be moved to some other subject I think.  It seems the book's topic is central heating, that is heating a house.  It just uses math.  But, it is currently under Applied Mathematics.  If anything, the appropriate topic is How To or Home Repair or something (I don't know any topics that aren't math).  Any way, I think that it should be deleted instead of being moved.  This book has only chapter titles and nothing else, unless you count a short description of what a wikibook is and how you can work on it.  I assume if any one else writes a book on central heating, they're not going to use the same chapters any way.  The originator hasn't done anything in over 2 years, and it appears no one else has done anything at all.

Was tagged with {{tlx|query}} for over a week without any comments, but I'd like community input on whether this qualifies for deletion. [[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 19:33, 3 February 2010 (UTC)
:[[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' The query tag was added by Adrignola (10 January 2010) the RFD in (3 February 2010 ) none replied to, all work on the stub was halted in 22 November 2009 only one contributors [[User talk:Jonp154]] (last contribution to Wikibooks on 28 November 2009). This Wikibookian has done excellent work on at least one other book. I've checked this book's contributions on Google and they don't seem to have been copied so I'm of the opinion that some more time should be granted to this stub and if the work isn't continued I think I saw another book on house building a merge could also be proposed in any case there is content in it.
:Adrignola,  was it tagged as a query only because it stalled ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:21, 4 February 2010 (UTC)
::Yes.  I like to prod people to come back and finish what they started, else it likely won't get finished.  Putting that aside, this looks pretty encyclopedic in nature. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:03, 4 February 2010 (UTC)
:::I also thought about that. It was the reason why I searched for duplication (besides all the talks on Wikipedia content), since it isn't, deletion wouldn't be a great outcome. I think I remember a book about building a house, since all the content is mostly on the different ways to deal with foundations a merge would address it better (if not a keep would be in order).

      <comment>Checking if a move generates ko position seems to be incorrect. Verification needed.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi, I see this page had no recent editions but maybe someone will read this and correct the article or correct me. This checking if a move generates ko position seems to be wrong. Consider a simple situation where white captures an isolated black:

&lt;pre&gt;
++O++        ++O++
++XO+  ---&gt;  +O?O+
++O++        ++O++
&lt;/pre&gt;

So we have captured only one stone in this move but, as far as I know, the point marked &quot;?&quot; is not ko for black. I believe the correct condition for marking a point P ko is:
1) exactly one stone has been captured in the current move (that is: the stone at P)
AND
2) the stone that caused the capture (that is: played in the neighbourhood of P) forms a one-stone-chain being in atari

Or maybe I have missed something. Please verify.

Note:
The “pericardium volume” was defined as a “rind” within the previously contoured heart volumes. The manually contoured heart volumes served as the outer border, and the inner border was automatically contoured 1 cm within these same contours using the planning. The heart pericardium contours on successive axial CT slices were meshed into a 3D structure (PMID 9422572).

;Athlete's Foot
Athlete's foot (also called ringworm of the foot and tinea pedis) is a fungal infection of the foot, especially between the toes. Essential oils that are partucularly helpful in treating athlete's foot include [[Complete Guide to Essential Oils/A to Z of essential oils/Tagetes|tagetes]], [[Complete Guide to Essential Oils/A to Z of essential oils/Lavender|lavender]], [[Complete Guide to Essential Oils/A to Z of essential oils/Geranium|geranium]] and [[Complete Guide to Essential Oils/A to Z of essential oils/Tea Tree|tea tree]], for their anti-fungal properties.
==Treatment==
Essential oils can be applied to the feet in the bath, soaking in a foot bath or as a warm compress. They can also be applied using a carrier oil—calendula oil is a good one to use. The feet should be treated every morning and evening. It's also important to make sure that feet are dried thoroughly after washing, to avoid letting them stay moist, and that socks are changed frequently. Allowing the feet to be open to the air helps, although it's also important to avoid infecting other people, so don't walk barefoot in public places.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Carrier oils (also called base oils) are oils used to dilute essential oils and enable them to be applied to the skin, through massage for example. Carrier oils are generally safe and non-toxic, although individuals may have specific allergies to particular oils (especially nut oils). Although they are used as a vehicle for essential oils, different carrier oils may have certain healing properties of their own.
==Most common carrier oils==
*Almond oil
*Aloe vera oil
*Apricot kernel oil
*Avocado oil
*Calendula oil
*Coconut oil
*Evening primrose oil
*Grape seed oil
*Hazelnut oil
*Jojoba oil
*Macadamia oil

;Depression
Depression is a serious psychiatric disorder also called clinical depression or major depressive disorder. Depression is also the name for ''feelings'' of sadness, helplessness, or hopelessness, which may be a result of clinical depression or other psychiatric disorders, or may arise for some other reason, such as bereavement, job loss, major life changes, or physical illness. If you have depressed feelings for a long time, or for no obvious reason, you should see a doctor. Whatever the reason, low moods can be soothed by using essential oils.

{{recipe}}

There is really no &quot;right&quot; way to make. Everybody's mom makes it differently. There are many different recipes, most are good and all have their advantages.

If you are having people to dinner on Friday, make the sauce Thursday night and then throw the whole pot in the fridge overnight. Before dinner (about when you're putting the pasta water on to boil), pull the pot out and put it on Low. What a time saver! And the overnight rest period allows amazing flavors and sweetness to form. You will be impressed.

==Recipe I==
''Note: This is the classic expensive restaurant edition. You only live once.''

===Ingredients===
*1/2 stick unsalted sweet cream [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*1 tbsp vegetable or olive oil
*2 medium cloves garlic, crushed and chopped fine
*1/3 cup (80 g) diced red onion
*1/2 tsp dried oregano (trust me)
*1/2 tsp dried crushed red pepper flakes
*1 can (28 oz - 750 g) unsalted whole peeled tomatoes, reserve juice (use name brand, they're bigger and sweeter)
*1 can (6 oz - 150 g) tomato paste
*1 + 1/2 tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] (more or less to taste)
*1 + 1/2 tsp granulated sugar
*1/2 tsp ground black pepper

===Exact, step by step preparation instructions===
#Heat a large [[Cookbook:Pot|pot]] over medium flame approximately 5 minutes, until hot.
#Add butter and oil; heat until clear (bubbling stops)
#Add onion; gently [[Cookbook:Sauteing|sauté]] for 1 minute
#Reduce heat to medium-low
#Add garlic; gently sauté for 1 minute
#Add tomato juice.
#Add tomatoes, one at a time, crushing completely using your hands (watch for spurts)
#Add oregano and red pepper flakes
#Stir to combine;
#Cover and reduce heat to low.  Simmer for 10-15 minutes.
#Add 1 tsp salt and sugar, black pepper, and tomato paste; Stir until paste is incorporated
#Cover and simmer for 10 minutes
#Taste and season accordingly. You do not want the sauce to be salty, just not unsalty. You do not want the sauce to be sweet, just not sour. Season by adding the remaining salt and sugar a little at a time, stirring completely between tastes.
#Serve over ''[[Cookbook:Al Dente|al dente]]'' spaghetti with a side of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]] or [[Cookbook:meatball|meatballs]] and a deep sweet [[Cookbook:Red Wine|red wine]] ([[w:merlot|merlot]]); serves 4, make this for two and enjoy again tomorrow night!

==Recipe II==
''Note: This is a more rustic and less &quot;Italian-American&quot; recipe than the previous one.''

'''Tonkotsu ramen''' is ramen noodles served in rich and fatty pork broth usually garnished with a variation of toppings (most of the time pork cutlets, green onions, and hard-boiled eggs split in two). There are many variations to this recipe. Some people add some chicken bones or beef bones to create a unique combination of flavors. A lot of the ingredients aren't available in just any grocery stores. You shouldn't have a lot of trouble finding them at the Asian grocers in your local international district. You would be surprised on how much better tasting it is than the store bought instant ramen brands.


== Ingredients ==
 ''Serves 5-6''



===Soup===


*6 Pork hock bones   
*3 Green Onion
*1 Fuji Apple       
*2 Med. Sized Yellow Onions
*1 1/2 Tbsp. Grated Ginger (2 Tsp of the tube kind is ok)
*3 Cloves of quartered Garlic
*2 Tbsp Sesame Oil
*12-16 Cups Water

===Noodles===
*500 grams of All purpose flour or medium strength flour 
*5 grams of Powdered Kansui (alkaline salts – Koon Chun brand, it comes in a clear glass bottle labeled “potassium carbonate &amp; sodium bi-carbonate solution” and the UPC is 0-20717-80230-8)
*200 cc of Water 
*Potato or Corn starch (for flouring)

===Char Siu (part of the garnish)===
*500 grams of Side Pork   
*50 cc of Soy Sauce
*50 cc Mirin   
*1 tbsp of Sugar  
*500 cc of Water

== Procedure ==
*1. Using a butcher knife, separate off the pork hock bones.
*2. Rinse well in running water to wash off the blood. Boil in large pot for 15 minutes and make sure you barely cover the bones with the water.
*3. Skim off as much scum/foam as much possible as it forms.
*4. Drain in colander and use a brush to remove any bloody meat.
*5. Use a saw and cut halfway down the center of the bones. Then use hammer to break bone.
*6. The bones will be filled with marrow. Simmer for several hours until the marrow dissolves out from the bones.
*7. Scum will form at the start. Carefully skim the scum off. On mid flame, maintain a low boil.
*8. After scum has stopped forming, simmer for 6 hours or more. Add more water if the water level drops.
*9. Now to make the noodles. After measuring out the ingredients, mix the flour and kansui together, then add the water. It may feel as if the amount of water is insufficient. This is normal.
*10. Mix in bowl until a mealy consistency is achieved.
*11. The dough will be very stiff. Use you body weight to form the dough into a ball.
*12. Transfer to kneading surface and knead. Knead vigorously for 10 minutes. It is ok if the dough cracks or does not knead together well.
*13. Form into ball, cover with plastic wrap and allow to rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Make sure that the dough does not dry out.
*14. While the dough rests, prepare the char siu. Brown the meat in a pan and then simmer in a pot for 2 hours in a sauce made from the remaining ingredients. Allow to cool in the pot.
*15. After the dough has rested, roll the dough out with a rolling pin to a thickness of 5 mm and then insert into pasta machine. Start out with the highest thickness and then continue on the lower settings until the desired thickness is achieved.
*16. If a pasta machine is not used, roll out the dough to the desired thickness with the rolling pin. Take into account that the noodles will expand 1.3 times when boiled.
*17. The dough will not be that sticky, so a small amount of flour or potato (or corn) starch is sufficient for flouring. (Note that the recipe only shows the noodles being cut by a pasta machine and does not mention hand cutting)
*18. A wooden box is best for storing the noodles, but if one is not available, use a metal tray lined with wax paper (to prevent sticking) and store in the refrigerator.
*19. 2 hours after the pork bones have started simmering, the soup should become progressively white and cloudy. If tasted at this stage, the soup will not taste good since it will still have a raw flavor.
*20. After the soup has simmered for 6 hours, the soup should look like this. The inside of the bones should now be empty and the soup should have a rich smell just like a ramen place.
*21.The char siu should be a nice amber color. Slice with care since it will be very tender and tend to fall apart.
*22. It’s time to put everything together. Since boiling time can differ, boil the noodles to each person’s preference. For people who like curly noodles, firmly squeeze the noodles until the desired effect is achieved.
*23. Warm the bowl, and add the char siu sauce and salt for flavor. Use sparingly at first and then add more if desired.
*24. I prefer to boil the noodles for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Your rich and hearty tonkotsu ramen is complete.

== Hints &amp; Tips ==
*Any leftover char siu can be eaten with beer. If you ever have trouble slicing soft pork, chill the whole piece in the refrigerator until cold, and it makes slicing easier. Reheating is easy, in either the microwave or oven, even stove top.
*Make sure you keep up on scooping out the foamy gunk, you don't want all that stuff all over your authentic ramen.


== Garnish Idea ==
===Ingredients===
*12 eggs in shells
*1 lb. Diced pork hock meat (leftovers from recipe above) 
*3 green onions cut into 1 inch pieces
*1 thumb sized piece of ginger sliced
*2 large cloves of garlic sliced
*1/2 cup soy sauce
*2 Tablespoons cooking wine/sake/sherry
*2 Tablespoons Sugar
*1/2 cup water

===Procedure===
Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil. (Using a small thumb tack, I prick a pin hole in the base (fat end) of every egg, but that’s not necessary.) The the water is at a full boil, I put the eggs in. The water should cover the eggs. Wait for the water to come back to a full boil, and time for 7 minutes. (9 minutes will give you a fully hard boiled egg. 7 minutes is a very soft boiled egg.) Drain the pot and eggs and plunge the eggs in ice water to stop cooking. This also makes the shells a bit easier to peel. In a small pot, saute pork, garlic, onions, and ginger until slightly browned. Add soy sauce, cooking alcohol, sugar, water and simmer for 10 minutes. Until pork is cooked through and flavors meld. Remove from stove. Remove pork to eat separately. Pour everything else into a bowl large enough to hold marinade and eggs. Carefully, peel the eggs, and place in marinade. Try to mae sure the marinade covers all of the eggs. If not, try transferring the sauce into a large ZipLock bag, and place the eggs in the bag and seal. Place the bag in a bowl, and put everything in the refrigerator overnight. Or at least for a few hours. It is now ready to be placed on top of the ramen.

Don't be afraid to experiment with different types and balances of garnishes!

      <text xml:space="preserve">In practice, primality testing for numbers of a size suitable for cryptographic applications has to be done in a probabilistic way. Such an algorithm can tell whether a given number is prime with extremely high probability, but cannot provide a certain proof. Many such algorithms operate with a variable number of rounds of testing; each additional round of testing makes it less likely to falsely classify the number, so the implementor can choose a suitable number of rounds to provide a trade off between the level of certainty and the running time of the algorithm.

==Miller-Rabin (or Rabin-Miller) primality test==

==Pseudocode==
 '''Input''': ''n'' &gt; 3, an odd integer to be tested for primality; 
 '''Input''': ''k'', a parameter that determines the accuracy of the test
 '''Output''': ''composite'' if ''n'' is composite, otherwise ''probably prime''
 write ''n'' − 1 as 2&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;·''d'' with ''d'' odd by factoring powers of 2 from ''n'' − 1
 LOOP: repeat ''k'' times:
    pick ''a'' randomly in the range [2, ''n'' − 2]
    ''x'' ← ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; mod ''n''
    if ''x'' = 1 or ''x'' = ''n'' − 1 then do next LOOP
    for ''r'' = 1 .. ''s'' − 1
       ''x'' ← ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; mod ''n''
       if ''x'' = 1 then return ''composite''
       if ''x'' = ''n'' − 1 then do next LOOP
    return ''composite''
 return ''probably prime''

:There is no need for typing. Simply copy it by selecting it with mouse, there is black background and white text then. Then copy it either with Ctrl+C or with the secondary mouse button. Then back in where you need it, just paste it there (again, either Ctrl-P or secondary mouse button).

== Welcome ==
I'm extremely interested in the [[Algorithm Implementation]] book. On this subject and by coincidence today I examined an old bookmark, http://www.algorithmatic.com/ (even if I can't fully access the content, as it seems it needs [[w:ActiveX|ActiveX]] on), the concept described is fantastic and the content seems to be released under the public domain, so it's directly usable. It is somehow similar to http://stackoverflow.com in structure, except the embedded IDE (that seems to be the cause of my problem).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 09:42, 26 March 2010 (UTC)</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Small Cell Lung Cancer Review'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Epidemiology==
*US Incidence: ~35 thousand
*Primary risk factor: tobacco
*Limited stage: 20-30% at diagnosis


==Clinical Presentation &amp; Workup==
*Clinical presentation: Cough and dyspnea
*Paraneoplastic syndromes: 
**[[w:Lambert-Eaton_myasthenic_syndrome|Lambert-Eaton]]: progressive muscular weakness similar to myasthenia gravis, but starting with proximal leg muscles, caused by autoantibody to voltage-gated calcium channels. 50% of LEMS are found to have underlying SCLC
**[[w:Encephalomyelitis|Paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis]]: multiple neurologic deficits, caused by anti-Hu antibody that cross-reacts with SCLC antigens and neuronal RNA-binding proteins
**[[w:Cushing's_syndrome|Cushing's syndrome]]: central obesity (including moon face and buffalo hump), thin skin, hirsutism, striated skin, caused by inappropriate ACTH release  
**[[w:Syndrome_of_inappropriate_antidiuretic_hormone_hypersecretion|SIADH]]: hyponatremia and fluid overload, caused by inapropriate ADH release. Found in ~16% SCLC vs 2% NSCLC
*CXR presentation: Large hilar mass with bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy; solitary nodule ~5%
*Pathology
**Malignant epithelial tumor, small cells, scant cytoplasm, high mitotic count
**In up to 30% of autopsies, areas of NSCLC differentiation, suggesting pluripotent stem cell origin
**Immunoreactive for keratin, epithelial membrane antigen, TTF-1 and neuroendocrine markers (chromogranin A, NSE, NCAM, synaptophysin) though these alone not sufficient since they are present in ~10% of NSCLC
**p53 positive in 90% SCLC vs. 50% NSCLC; RB LOH in 90% SCLC vs 10% NSCLC; 
*Workup
**Chest/liver/adrenal CT
**Head MRI (positive in 10-15%)
**PET (optional) or bone scan (positive in 30% with no bone pain or LDH elevation)
*Staging: 
**Limited stage: can be safely encolosed in RT portal (corresponds to Stage I-IIIB)
**Extensive stage: metastatic disease (corresponds to Stage IV)

==Limited Stage Therapy==
*Median OS 14-20 months; 2-year OS 40%; 5-year OS 15-25%
*Chemotherapy primary therapy
**Cisplatin/etoposide is NCCN recommended combination; cisplatin/irinotecan not superior
*Addition of thoracic RT: improves local control and survival (meta-analysis)
**RT used in most of the trials was 45 Gy QD
**Chemotherapy alone intrathoracic failure: 50-90%
**Intrathoracic control benefit: chemo-RT improved by 25% (SS)
**Survival benefit: 3-year chemo-RT 14% vs. chemo alone 9% (SS); 5% absolute benefit
**Excess treatment-related deaths: chemo-RT worse by 1.2% (SS)
*Timing/duration of RT (meta-analysis)
**Benefit for early RT in cisplatin-based concurrent trials (HR 0.6), 5-year OS 10-15% to 20-30%
**If RT started with 30 days of chemo: 2-year OS benefit HR 0.7 (SS)
**If duration &lt;30 days: even more benefit
*RT dose/fractionation
**INT 0096 (Turisi): 45 QD vs 45 BID with concurrent cisplatin 60 mg/m2 and etoposide 120 mg/m2 Q3W
***Survival benefit: 2-years QD 41% vs BID 47%, 5-years 16% vs 26% (SS)
***Local failure: QD 52% vs. BID 36% (p=0.06)
***Grade 3 esophagitis: QD 11% vs 27% (SS), no differen

==Extensive Stage Therapy==
*Median OS 9-11 months; 2-year OS &lt;5%
*Chemotherapy primary therapy
**No benefit to dose intensification
**If symptomatic brain mets, whole brain RT first
**If asymptomatic brain mets or no brain involvement, start with chemotherapy
**If no progression on chemo, prophylactic cranial irradiation
*RT may benefit patients in CR after chemotherapy (Yugoslavian Trial - Jeremic)
**Cisplatin/etoposide x3 cycles. If distant CR and local CR/PR, RT 54/35
**Median OS 11 months vs 17 months (SS)


==Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation==
*Incidence: 15-20% at diagnosis, 60-80% at autopsy
*Limited stage, in CR after induction (meta-analysis), WBRT improves local control and overall survival
**Brain mets without PCI: 3-years ~60% 
**Brain mets with PCI: 3-years 33%, reduction of 50% (SS)
**Survival benefit: 3-year 21% vs 15% (SS); 5% absolute benefit
**RT dose: 25/10 noninferior to &quot;high dose&quot; (36/18 or 36/24), with survival benefit
*Extensive stage, with response after induction (EORTC 08993/22993), WBRT improves local control and overall survival
**Symptomatic brain mets without PCI: 40%
**Symptomatic brain mets with PCI: 15%
**Survival benefit: 1-year 27% vs 13% (SS)
**RT dose: 20/5 used in 60%, considered reasonable given short survival</text>

      <comment>/* XSLT Version Check */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to have an Apache Ant task that runs the Saxon XSLT transform.

== Method ==
Download the Saxon jar file.
Put the saxon.jar file in a lib folder.
Run the following test.

== Source Code ==

=== Build File ===

The following is how Saxon is invoked from Apache Ant.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;target name=&quot;test-saxon&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xslt classpath=&quot;lib\saxon8.jar&quot;
      in=&quot;in.xml&quot; 
      out=&quot;out.html&quot; 
      style=&quot;check-version.xsl&quot;&gt;
      &lt;factory name=&quot;net.sf.saxon.TransformerFactoryImpl&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/xslt&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that if you are running in Eclipse you will have to go to the &quot;Preferences&quot; menu and add the saxon9.jar file to Ant/Runtime/Ant Home Entries.  Just click the &quot;Add JARs&quot; and add the saxon9jar file the end of this list.

== XSLT Version Check ==

check-version.xsl:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&quot;1.0&quot; xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xsl:output omit-xml-declaration=&quot;yes&quot; indent=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/&quot;&gt;
        &lt;results&gt;
            &lt;Version&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;system-property('xsl:version')&quot; /&gt;&lt;/Version&gt;
            &lt;Vendor&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;system-property('xsl:vendor')&quot; /&gt;&lt;/Vendor&gt;
            &lt;Vendor-URL&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;system-property('xsl:vendor-url')&quot; /&gt;&lt;/Vendor-URL&gt;
        &lt;/results&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Or if you are generating a web page:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&quot;1.0&quot;
   xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/&quot;&gt;
      &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
         &lt;title&gt;XSL Version&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
           &lt;p&gt;Version:
           &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;system-property('xsl:version')&quot; /&gt;
           &lt;br /&gt;
           Vendor:
           &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;system-property('xsl:vendor')&quot; /&gt;
           &lt;br /&gt;
           Vendor URL:
           &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;system-property('xsl:vendor-url')&quot; /&gt;
           &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
     &lt;/html&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think that answering &quot;Yes&quot; to 1a shows a bias for a particular alphabet and number system.  

For example, what about Cyrillic characters?  They are part of an alphabet, and therefore should be considered an element of the universe of alphanumeric characters.
If you include all alphabets, do you include linear A and other extinct alphabets?  
If so, should you include possible future alphabets, which would in effect may the answer to 1A &quot;No&quot; because the set of all possible alphabets is not well defined. 

What about numeric characters.  The answer given lists only characters for base 10.  There are an infinite number of possible bases, which would then require an infinite number of unique numeric characters.  This also makes the answer for 1a &quot;No&quot;.</text>

      <comment>mention Kerckhoffs's principle</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Creating a good cryptographic algorithm that will stand against all that the best cryptanalysis can throw at it, is hard. Very hard. So, this is why most people design algorithms by first designing the basic system, then refining it, and finally letting it lose for all to see.

Why, do this? Surely, if you let everyone see your code that turns a plain bit of text into garbled rubbish, then they will be able to reverse it! This assumption is unfortunately wrong. Now the algorithms that have been/ are being made are so strong, that just reversing the algorithm is not effective when trying to crack it. And when you let people look at your algorithm, they may spot a security flaw that nobody else could see.
We talk more about this counter-intuitive idea in another chapter,
[[../Basic Design Principles/#Kerckhoffs's principle]].

AES, one of the newest and strongest (2010) algorithms in the world, was created by a team of two people, and was put forward into a sort of competition, where only the best algorithm would be examined and put forward to be selected for the title of the Advanced Encryption Standard. There were about 35 entrants, and although all of them appeared strong at first, it soon became clear that some of these apparently strong algorithms were in fact, very weak!

AES is a good example of open algorithms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Namely if the function is analytic its real and imaginary parts must have the partial derivative of all orders the function is analytic it must satifiy the CAuchy Riemann equation.

A holomorphic function is harmonic, provided it is of class C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Let the function f = u+iv be holomorphic and of class C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

By the Cauchy-Riemann equations, we have:

d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;u/dx&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=d/dx(dv/dy)=d/dy(dv/dx)=-d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;u/dy&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Which proves that u is harmonic. Similar reasoning proves the same result for v, and thus f is harmonic.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you have questions, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]].

You want to gather feedback from visitors.

== Implementation ==
A simple HTML form gathers suggested improvements and an email address. The suggestion is emailed to one of the authors and an acknowledgment sent to the submitter.  Here the default send-mail client on the eXist implementation at UWE, Bristol is used.

== XQuery script ==
&lt;pre&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
 
(: A simple Feedback form using the eXist mail module :)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Geochronology is the field of science concerned with determining the ages of rocks and other stuff.  In this book we attempt to outline the basic principles used for the quantification of geological time focusing on the radio-isotopic dating techniques.  We are attempting to be inclusive about the methodologies and applications however there is a focus on the mainstream chronometers and the application of these to the quantification of geologic time.

{{TOC}}
&lt;br /&gt;
























U-Pb geochronology is often regarded as the gold standard of geochronology because unlike all other chronometers it exploits two independent decay schemes, &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U to &lt;sup&gt;207&lt;/sup&gt;Pb and &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U to &lt;sup&gt;206&lt;/sup&gt;Pb and both the  &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U and &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U decay constants are relatively precise and accurate (Jaffey et al., 1971){{ref|Jaffey1971}}.   The advantage of two independent chronometers in the same mineral is that it is possible to detect small amounts of open system behavior such as Pb loss or the inheritance of an older mineral.  This is a major factor in our ability to make reliable, high-precision age determinations as we can evaluate whether a number of analyses represents a single time of mineral growth.  The different half lives of &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U and &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U, ca. 4.5 and ca. 0.7 Ga respectively, means that by the Neoproterozoic much smaller amounts of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U (relative to &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U) remain due to the higher decay rate, therefore smaller amounts &lt;sup&gt;207&lt;/sup&gt;Pb are produced per increment relative to &lt;sup&gt;206&lt;/sup&gt;Pb.  Although all three dates can be calculated from most published analyses, the relative precisions are related to the analytical technique employed (see section 5 for further discussion of age uncertainties).  The U-Pb method is most-often applied to U-bearing accessory minerals such as zircon found in igneous rocks and the most common way to graphically represent the data is the Concordia diagram.


==Analyical Methods==
There are a number of different analytical approaches that can be used to dtermine the U/Pb ratio and isotopic composition of U-bearing accessory minerals.  The different techniques types discussed in more detail below. 
&lt;br /&gt;
===Isotope Dillution Thermal Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (ID-TIMS)===
Isotope dilution where minerals are dissolved in the presense of tracer isotopes

===Secondary Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (SIMS)===

===Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS)===

===Visualising U-Pb data===
Two separate dates for a zircon based on each individual decay scheme may be calculated and plotted on a concordia diagram (Fig. 1).  On a conventional (Wetherill) concordia diagram the X and Y axis are the &lt;sup&gt;207&lt;/sup&gt;Pb/&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U and &lt;sup&gt;206&lt;/sup&gt;Pb/&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U ratios respectively, and the concordia curve represents the simultaneous solution of the decay equations for a given age.  A third 207Pb/206Pb date can be determined from only Pb isotopic measurements by knowing both the &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U and &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U decay constants and the present day &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U/&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U ratio which is assumed to be 137.88 (Steiger and Jager, 1977){{ref|SteigerJager1977}}.  Calculation of the U/Pb dates requires determination of the Pb*/U ratio (Pb* denotes radiogenic Pb).

===Pb-loss===
It has been known for several decades that zircons often show evidence of post-crystallization Pb loss.  This has the effect of lowering the U/Pb ratios and the derived dates (see Fig. 2).  Silver and Duetsch (Silver and Duetsch, 1963) demonstrated that Pb-loss was correlated with radiation damage.  Since that time it has become widely appreciated that the Pb-loss is not by thermally activated volume diffusion but rather by fast-pathway diffusion from damaged parts of the crystal lattice.  In order to minimise/eliminate the effects of post-crystallisation Pb loss it is possible to pre-treat zircons using techniques to remove domains that have lost Pb leaving zircon domains that have remained closed systems.  
* [[/Air Abrasion/]]
The first approach developed involved physically abrading away the exterior portions of the zircons (Krogh, 1982a), based on the observation that the outer portions were richest in U and thus susceptible to radiation damage and Pb loss.  At the same time Krogh (Krogh, 1982b) also demonstrated that the selection of the least magnetic zircons often corresponded to the lowest U contents and had least amount of Pb loss.  These approaches were widely applied until the development of a new technique described as ‘chemical abrasion’ (Mattinson, 2005).  
* [[/Chemical Abrasion/]]
This technique involves annealing zircon grains at 800-900°C followed by partial dissolution.  This method effectively “mines out” or preferentially dissolves the higher U parts of the zircon that have been damaged by radiation and are thus susceptible to fast-pathway diffusion of Pb from the zircon crystal.  This method seems to offer the promise of the effective elimination of open system behaviour in most zircon. Microbeam techniques (see section 4.1.2) have not typically employed pre-treatment techniques as they assume that Pb loss is restricted to the exterior portions of grains which they attempt to avoid during the in-situ analyses.

Radioactive decay schemes are suitable for dating minerals and rocks and are listed in Table 1.  All of these systems are based upon the radioactive decay of a parent nuclide to a stable daughter nuclide.  Obtaining accurate information from these decay systems for the purposes of determining the age of a mineral or rock requires: (1) the decay constant of the parent nuclide is accurately and precisely determined; (2) closed system behaviour, which can be simply stated to mean that the Parent/daughter ratio has only changed by radioactive decay; and (3) the initial daughter nuclide, if present, can be precisely and accurately accounted for.  In this section we outline the basic principles of the various radio-isotopic geochronometers, differentiating the U-Pb system applied to U-bearing accessory minerals from the isochron geochronometers (Re-Os, Lu-Hf, Pb-Pb etc.) applied to chemical precipitates and organic residues.&lt;br /&gt;

==Minerals==
===Zircon===
[[W:Zircon|Zircon]] (ZrSiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is a common accessory mineral in silicic volcanic rocks ranging from lavas to air-fall tuffs to volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks and is a nearly ubiquitous component of most clastic sedimentary rocks. The refractory and durable nature of zircon over a wide range of geological conditions means that it is likely to retain its primary crystallization age even through subsequent metamorphic events.   Silicic air-fall [[W:Tuff|tuffs]] are the most common volcanic rocks in fossil-bearing sequences and are found in layers that range in thickness from a millimeter to many meters and are commonly preserved in marine settings.  In most of these rocks the primary volcanic ash has been altered, probably soon after deposition, to clay minerals in a process that does not affect zircon. &lt;br /&gt;

Zircon is ideal for U-Pb dating because U has a similar charge and ionic radius to Zr it substitutes readily into the zircon crystal structure (in modest amounts, typically in the 10’s to hundreds of parts per million (ppm) range) whereas Pb has a different charge and larger ionic radius leading to its effective exclusion from the crystal lattice.  Therefore at the time of crystallization (t0) there is effectively no Pb present in a crystal (although mineral and fluid inclusions may contain Pb) and the present day Pb is the direct product of in-situ U decay since t0 (see section 3.1 for further details).  An additional factor that makes zircon a robust chronometer is its high closure temperature (&gt;900°C) to Pb diffusion (Cherniak and Watson, 2003), or the temperature below which U and Pb do not undergo significant thermally activated volume diffusion.  This means that zircons tend to preserve their primary ages even in volcanic rocks metamorphosed to amphibolite-facies conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Analytical methodologies==

The majority of age constraints for Neoproterozoic strata have been obtained by U-Pb zircon dating therefore most of this section is concerned with U-Pb analytical methods.  The analytical methods used for the ‘isochron geochronometers’ have similarities with the ID-TIMS U-Pb method however the differences are discussed below.  &lt;br /&gt;

==U-Pb methodologies==
There are two main approaches to U-Pb zircon geochronology: in-situ ‘microbeam’ techniques and isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS). The major difference is that in ID-TIMS geochronology, zircon is dissolved and the U and Pb separated from the other elements prior to analysis whereas in microbeam techniques the zircon is analyzed using either a laser that ablates the sample prior to injection into a plasma  or a focussed ion beam that generates secondary ions from a sectioned and polished epoxy mount or thin section.&lt;br /&gt;
  
=== U-Pb ID-TIMS ===
ID-TIMS analyses of zircon (either as multi-grain fractions, single grains or grain fragments) involves dissolution of the zircon in the presence of tracer isotopes and is called isotope dilution.  For U-Pb ID-TIMS analyses the most common tracers are 205Pb and 235U.  205Pb is an artificial isotope that does not occur in nature whereas 235U occurs naturally but an enriched form is used as a tracer.  Natural U in the zircon assumed to have a 238U/235U = 137.88 (Steiger and Jager, 1977) therefore the tracer can be used to determine the number of moles of 238U and 235U in a sample.  Since the tracer is added before dissolution, the tracer/sample isotope ratios stay constant despite incomplete recovery during chemistry and low ionization efficiency during analysis. Following dissolution the sample undergoes chemical purification using anion exchange chemistry that allows separation of the Zr and REEs from the Pb and U, and Pb and U from one another.&lt;br /&gt;
  
Following purification Pb and U are analysed separately by thermal ionisation mass spectrometry where the ratios of sample isotopes (204Pb, 206Pb, 238U, etc) to the tracer isotopes (205Pb, 235U) can be measured.  As the amount of tracer isotope added to the same is known the number of atoms of each naturally occurring isotope in the sample determined based upon the measured ratio of sample isotope/tracer isotope ratio.  . After corrections for mass fractionation, the minor contribution of common Pb and U from the reagents, the tracer and labware, the sample 206Pb/207Pb, 206Pb/238U and 207Pb/235U ratios can be determined and 206Pb/207Pb, 206Pb/238U and 207Pb/235U dates calculated. See section 5.2.3 for further discussion of the isotope dilution technique.  Optimisation of this technique means that it is now possible to date zircons with &lt;10 pg radiogenic Pb and obtain precision &lt;0.1% on the U/Pb ratio for single grain analyses.  It is a very labour intensive technique, each single U/Pb analyses takes several hours of mass-spectrometry and chemical purification in an ultra-clean lab environment, making it time consuming to develop high-n datasets.

===U-Pb Microbeam techniques===

U-Pb geochronology by microbeam techniques has revolutionized geochronology over the past two decades. The two major techniques are Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS), typified by the SHRIMP (Sensitive High Resolution Ion Microprobe), and Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Both of these techniques (collectively termed ‘microbeam’ techniques) offer high-spatial resolution analyses using either a focused ion beam to sputter a volume of zircon (SIMS) or a laser that is used to vaporise a volume of zircon (LA-ICP-MS).  Microbeam techniques allow in-situ analysis of very small volumes and thus high-spatial resolution; a typical volume of zircon analyzed by an ion-probe is cylindrical, 20-30 microns in diameter and several microns deep, with somewhat larger volumes for LA-ICPMS (Kosler and Sylvester, 2003). In addition the analyses can be done relatively rapidly (many 10’s analyses per day for LA-ICPMS and SIMS). Furthermore, these techniques allow analysis of remaining mineral for other isotopes/elements of interest (Hf, O, REE’s) and can be made on the same zircon grains in close proximity to the volume analyzed for geochronology.&lt;br /&gt;

Fundamental to the microbeam U-Pb zircon methods is use of a primary standard against which the U/Pb ratio of the unknown zircon is calibrated.  For SIMS techniques this calibration involves the analyses of standard zircon to develop a calibration curve for a known U/Pb ratio (which is determined via ID-TIMS analyses) and against which analyses of unknown zircons can be compared.  This is achieved through analytical sessions where a standard zircon is repeatedly analysed interspersed with analyses of unknown zircons (this is termed sample-standard bracketing). During the course of a single analytical session, the measured ratio/date of a standard can drift by several percent.  For LA-ICPMS the approach is somewhat similar in that sample-standard bracketing is employed in order to determine the inter-elemental fractionation which is then applied to the unknown zircons.  In both SIMS and LA-ICPMS techniques the 207Pb/206Pb ratio is a direct measurement, for SIMS mass-dependent fractionation appears to be minimal and the measured ratio is commonly used whereas in LA-ICPMS analyses mass dependent fractionation is quantifiable and is corrected for either using sample-standard bracketing and/or using a solution with known 205Tl/203Tl ratio to correct for mass bias on Pb isotopic ratios.  For further details of microbeam techniques see Ireland and Williams (Ireland and Williams, 2003) for a review of SIMS U-Pb geochronology and Kosler and Sylvester (Kosler and Sylvester, 2003) for a review of LA-ICPMS geochronology&lt;br /&gt;

The benefit of the high spatial resolution provided by microbeam techniques is a tradeoff in that the precision of individual spot analyses using LA-ICPMS and SIMS is lower than ID-TIMS by approximately an order of magnitude (Ireland and Williams, 2003; Kosler and Sylvester, 2003).  In-situ techniques are without question essential tools for characterizing complex (zoned) zircons from volcanic and metamorphic rocks and for characterizing detrital populations which in some cases can provide robust estimates of the minimum age of a sequence. &lt;br /&gt;

==Isochron techniques==

Isochron techniques involve analysis of multiple samples assumed to be the same age, have a spread in parent/daughter ratio, and have remained closed systems. In order to maximize the likelyhood that the samples are the same age and have the same initial isotopic composition it is preferable to design an appropriate sampling strategy.  For example, Re-Os geochronology is often attempted on laminated organic rich shales so it is essential to have multiple samples from the same restricted stratigraphic interval (e.g., (Kendall et al., 2004), to avoid samples that span an amount of time much larger than uncertainties. In some cases, such as working with core samples, this is not always possible (Kendall et al., 2006; Schaefer and Burgess, 2003).  This could be a complicating factor if there is temporal variation in the initial isotopic composition of the daughter element, and/or represents a significant amount of time, especially in condensed sections.   In U-Pb in carbonates, different cement domains can have very different U-Pb ratios but is difficult to know a priori whether the cements are all exactly the same age and have the same initial ratios.  In both of these cases, deviations from the assumption of the same age and initial ratio lead to increased scatter and uncertainties in calculated dates.&lt;br /&gt;

Sample dissolution and purification techniques are similar to the procedures for U-Pb ID-TIMS.  Prior to isotope ratio mass spectrometry samples undergo dissolution and chemical purification.  For multi-element systems (such as Re-Os, U-Pb and Lu-Hf) isotopic tracers are added prior to dissolution for the isotope dilution (see above) whereas for systems where only daughter isotopes are measured (i.e., Pb-Pb), direct measurements of the isotope ratios are made. The isotopic composition is determined via thermal ionization mass-spectrometry although it is also possible to use solution mode ICPMS for most elements.  &lt;br /&gt;

The accuracy and precision of isochron techniques is largely controlled by a spread in initial parent/daughter ratio, closed system behaviour, and an identical initial isotopic composition for all samples.  For precipitates such as carbonates and phosphates there is often no significant detrital input however this is not the case for organic-rich shales targeted for Re-Os where there is potential that significant concentrations of initial Os from multiple sources.  This has been demonstrated in several studies (Creaser et al., 2002; Kendall et al., 2004) however it is possible to limit the detrital Os contribution by selective dissolution of the organic component using a CrO3-H2SO4 dissolution approach.  Kendall et al (Kendall et al., 2004) compared two dissolution methods (aqua regia vs. CrO3-H2SO4 dissolution) on greenschist facies organic rich shale from the Old Fort Point Formation in Western Canada.  Both dissolution techniques were used on the same powders, however the aqua regia method yielded scattered data and a resulting “isochron” regression with an MSWD of 65 and a large “age” uncertainty (9%) in comparison to the CrO3-H2SO4 dissolution method which yielded an isochron with much less scatter (MSWD = 1.2) and a relatively low uncertainty (0.8% 2) (Kendall et al., 2004).

This is the nth chapter of a Wikibook entitled [[Introduction_to_Geochronology|Introduction to Geochronology]].
We have learned in the earlier chapters C and D that radio-isotopic dating is capable of producing very precise dates however full exploitation of these data requires considerations of the associated uncertainties.  During the past two decades analytical precision has increased substantially due to improvements in both mass spectrometry and laboratory protocols.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;




&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

== Sources and types of uncertainty ==
Without an accurate estimation of total uncertainty, the radio-isotopic age of a given rock or mineral is of limited value.

It is necessary for users of  geochronological data to understand the various sources of error and when one must consider the total uncertainty of a given date as opposed to its constituent parts. Although the uncertainty of each date contains an internal/random component in the total uncertainty, there are also components that are systematic, such as errors from the decay constants.  When comparing ages determined by the same isotopic system these can be ignored offering a potential increase in resolving power.  In this section we review the different sources of uncertainties and the assumptions that underlie the often quoted (or not) errors.  For more detailed treatment of uncertainties in geochronology the following articles are recommended: Ireland and Williams (Ireland and Williams, 2003); Stern and Amelin (Stern and Amelin, 2003), Schmitz and Schoene (Schmitz and Schoene, 2007), and various papers by Ludwig (Ludwig, 1980, 1991, 1998, 2003).
    
&lt;big&gt;Random/internal uncertainties&lt;/big&gt;
Random/internal uncertainties are those relating to the measurement of isotopic ratios of the sample, standards and blank and are used in the derivation of errors of the radiogenic ratios. These uncertainties are intrinsic to each analysis and represent the minimum uncertainty that must be considered.  Most of these sources of random uncertainty relate to the mass spectrometry measurements and our ability to measure and reproduce isotopic ratios.  Factors such as the electronic noise of detectors place a theoretical limit on the precision which can be achieved by detecting a certain number of ions over a finite period of time (counting statistics).  However for almost all geochronologic applications other factors such as correction for mass dependent fractionation that occurs during sample ionisation, and correction for common and/or initial parent and daughter nuclide dominate the analytical uncertainty budget.  It is possible to reduce the uncertainty in the mass dependent fractionation via ‘double-spiking’, where two tracer isotopes of the same element (202Pb-205Pb, or 233U-235U for example) are used for real time mass fractionation correction.

==Systematic/external uncertainties==
Systematic uncertainties are those related to the uncertainty in absolute value of various constant parameters used in the calculation of either an isotopic ratio or in the calculation of the date itself.  As outlined below, these uncertainties are systematic for a given parameter and have to be considered when comparing dates calculated using different determinations of a given parameters.  If data are generated using the same parameter constants then these uncertainties can be ignored in order to assess the difference between dates.

==Decay constants==
One source of systematic uncertainty that affects all radio-isotopic dates are those related to the uncertainty in the decay constants (Table 1).   Three approaches have been taken to determine the decay constants (the probability that a given atom will decay per unit of time) of the long-lived radionuclide; (1) direct counting; (2) ingrowth and (3) geological comparison.  Direct counting involves the detection of alpha, beta or gamma activity relative to the total number of radioactive atoms.  Ingrowth relies upon the quantification of a decay product that is accumulated from a quantity of high-purity parent nuclide over a well-defined period of time. Geologic comparison involves the analyses of cogeneitc materials with multiple chronometers, knowing that each chronometer should yield the same date.  This approach has the potential for relative intercalibration of the decay constants but accurate intercalibration requires that at least one decay constant is accurate and known with some precision.  This is usually assumed to be the 238U and 235U due to the precision with which the decay constants have been determined (Jaffey et al., 1971) and the internal check provided by closed system zircon analyses (Mattinson, 2000; Schoene et al., 2006). 

The counting experiments of Jaffey et al (1971) determined the 238U and 235U decay constants with uncertainties of 0.11% and 0.14% respectively.  These values have been adopted for use in geochronology (Steiger and Jager, 1977).  The 187Re and 176Lu decay constants have been determined by both direct counting experiment and through geologic comparison with the U-Pb system and uncertainties are estimated at ca. 0.4 to 0.5% (Scherer et al., 2001; Selby et al., 2007).

The incorporation of decay constant uncertainties are becoming increasingly important as both the internal precision of dates is reduced and multiple geochronometers are being used to investigate the same time intervals.  The decay constant uncertainties for isochron dates are typically &lt;20% of the total uncertainty budget, in contrast the uncertainties in the U decay constants are often &gt;50% of the total uncertainty budget of U/Pb ID-TIMS dates (Fig. 2).   The situation for the ID-TIMS U/Pb community is that they are now often generating 206Pb/238U and 207Pb/206Pb dates often do not overlap within analytical precision and the U decay constant uncertainties must be considered (Begemann et al., 2001; Ludwig, 2000; Schoene et al., 2006).  As the ‘user’ often uses these date interchangeably we are now seeing 206Pb/238U and 207Pb/206Pb age uncertainties presented as ± X/Y/Z and ± X/Z respectively, where X is the analytical/internal uncertainty, Y is the analytical uncertainty plus the systematic tracer calibration uncertainty, and Z is the total uncertainty including X, Y and the decay constant uncertainties.  This permits use of the data with the level of uncertainty that is appropriate to the problem being addressed.  Mattinson, 2000, 2008 and Schoene et al., 2006 pointed out that sets of high-precision dates from zircons of different ages indicates a difference of approximately 0.2% between 206/238 dates and 207/206 dates due to probable inaccuracy in 235U  decay constant.  This has led to the suggestion that the 235U decay constant be recalculated to achieve concordance between 206/238 , 207/235, and 207/206 dates.  While not officially adopted the authors predict this will become common and users if data must be be aware of this trend.

==Calculating an age from multiple dates==
A significant proportion of age constraints for Neoproterozoic strata are derived from U-Pb dates on zircons from volcanic rocks.  The final reported date and associated uncertainty are often weighted mean dates derived from a number (n) of individual dates on different zircons (or zircon sub-domains).  This is the case for data acquired using both ID-TIMS and microbeam techniques.  The weighted mean weights each individual analyses (such as a single SIMS spot or single grain ID-TIMS analyses) according to its precision so analyses with a low uncertainty  contribute more to the weighted mean than those with high uncertainty.  Importantly, the use of a weighted mean algorithm (or other averaging) is underpinned by the expectation of a single population with normally distributed errors (i.e., there is no correlation between precision of analyses and age).  If the errors on the individual analyses are approximately equal (as is typical for microbeam U/Pb data) then the weighted mean uncertainty is proportional to 1/√n, therefore high-n datasets can be used to reduce the overall age uncertainty for data collected on a single population with normally distributed errors.  If the uncertainties on the individual analyses are variable then the weighted mean uncertainty is controlled by the most precise analyses making the weighted mean date less proportional to n. High-n datasets are critical for assessing analytical vs geological scatter, however the real limit on the precision is the analytical uncertainty of single (spot or grain) analyses as this controls our ability to resolve real variation within a series of analyses due to ‘open-system’ behaviour.

A common measure of the “coherence” of a data set is a statistical parameter called the MSWD (mean square of the weighted deviates; (York, 1966, 1967)). A value of approximately 1 indicates that the scatter in the data can be explained by analytical uncertainties alone, values much less than 1 indicates that analytical uncertainties have been overestimated, and values greater than 1 can indicate either that the uncertainties have been underestimated or that another source of scatter, often called “geological” scatter is present.  Furthermore, the actual MSWD value for which the scatter of the data can be considered due to analytical factors alone, is not restricted to a value of one but in fact varies according to the number of data points in the calculation (Wendt and Carl, 1991). So, to be 95% confident that the scatter of the data is due to the analysis when n=5, an acceptable MSWD range would be 0.2 - 2.2 but for n = 25 this would be 0.6-1.5 (Wendt and Carl, 1991). Although not often explicitly stated, an MSWD of 1 does not necessarily mean there is a single (age) population. Rather, it indicates that if real (age) variation is present, it cannot be resolved within the precision of the individual analyses.

==Uncertainties as a result of geologic complexity==
Uncertainty as a result of geologic complexity is the most difficult to quantify.  The most common cause of excess scatter is open system behaviour resulted from either inheritance of older zircon and/or Pb loss.  For U-Pb zircon analyses reduced errors on single analyses often exposes fine-scale variability that may reflect protracted or punctuated crystallisation of zircon crystals in a magma chamber or the effects of very subtle open system behaviour thus that high-precision analyses do not always transform into reduced uncertainties in calculated weighted mean dates.

Complex U-Pb zircon systematics 

In the past decade errors associated with ID-TIMS analyses have been reduced by almost an order of magnitude.   These reduced errors offer unprecedented precision but also expose geological complexity at the &lt;0.1 % level sometimes resulting in scatter that exceeds analytical uncertainties.  It is now common for a geochronologist to be faced with a population of zircon analyses that do not form a coherent cluster and the crucial question is how to interpret the data to arrive at a depositional age.  The advent of CA-TIMS pre-treatment for the elimination of Pb loss has been extremely important as it gives one confidence that in many cases Pb loss need not be considered as a cause of excess scatter.  Furthermore, for Neoproterozoic rocks, the concordia curve has a shallow enough slope, and the 207Pb/235U dates measured precisely enough to be able to evaluate discordance at the per mil level, however this is not the case for microbeam U/Pb dates.
As outlined above, microbeam U/Pb dates on volcanic rocks rely upon the averaging of a relatively high-n dataset (10-20) of relatively imprecise (ca. 2 to 4%) U/Pb determinations to get a weighted mean date with precision ca. 1% or less.  Underpinning these lower uncertainties is the assumption of a single population with normally distributed errors. However, it is the low precision of each analysis combined with variability of the standard analyses that bracket unknowns that often precludes the detection of subtle amounts of Pb loss or inheritance.  Stated another way, if the amount of Pb-loss or inheritance is less than the precision of a single spot analyses then it cannot be detected via normal statistical proxies (such as the MSWD) therefore the assumption of a normal distribution maybe be invalid (see Fig. 4).  If Pb-loss is the main source of open-system behaviour, this will have the effect of lowering the 206Pb/238U date on some analyses as well as the weighted mean 206Pb/238U date.&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Classical Experiment ==

-The most customary experiment consists of three main parts:
     1) Independent and Dependent Variables
     2) Pre-testing and Post-testing
     3) Experimental Control Groups
'''Independent and Dependent Variables'''
     Independent variable- A manipulated variable, in an experiment or study, whose presence or degree incurs a change in the
     dependent variable.
     Dependent Variable- The variable being studied in the experiment; it is expected to change when the independent variable is changed. 
*Thus, a typical experiment will examine the effects of the independent variable on the dependent variable.
*the independent variable will usually be the &quot;experimental stimulus.&quot;
*it can also be described as a dichotomous variable
 ex. having two characteristics
  -present or non-present
*the independent and dependent variable must be limitless.
 ex. a variable may be the independent variable in one study but serve as a dependent variable in another experiment.
*it is very helpful and important to define the independent and dependent variables in your research, and this should be done at the beginning of any experiment.
'''Pretesting and Post-testing'''
     Pre-testing- the initial measurement of a dependent variable among subjects
     Post-testing- the re-measurement of a dependent variable among subjects, after they have been introduced to the independent variable.
*once pre-testing and post-testing are conducted, any deviations between the first and final measurements are then stated as characteristics of the independent variable.

Subjects tend to undergo behavioral changes as a result of participating in an experiment. Examples of such changes include:
*The Hawthorne Effect- Subjects perform better when they are in an experiment
*Demand Characteristics- Subjects try to give the answer that they think is &quot;correct&quot; rather tham the honest answer
*Placebo Effect- Subjects respond to the ''belief'' that they are receiving a drug, regardless of whether they actually are or not

'''Experimental and Control Groups'''
     Experimental Group- a collection of subjects to whom the independent variable is administered.
     Control Group- a collection of subjects that do not receive the independent variable but should mimic the experimental group.
     The comparison of both groups at the conclusion of the experiment will point out the effects that the independent variable ahs had.
*when doing experimental research, it is very important to observe the experimental and control groups very closely.
*using a control group helps a researcher observe changes in the experiment due to the independent variable, by making such changes aeem more obvious.

(Insert graph pg 234)

'''The Double-Blind Experiment'''
     Double-Blind experiment- an experimental design in which the researchers are ignorant to which groups are experimental or control.
*using a double-blind experiment reduces biases of results from researchers.
 ex. If you know which group is the experimental group you may pay more attention to that group, potentially to the extent that you ignore the control group entirely.
     This will cause a problem at the end of the experiment, because you will not be able to witness or analyze the full effects that the independent variable has had.
*''Pgymalion Effect''- people perform better when more is expected of them

== Selecting Subjects ==

*For example, college students are frequently used in experiments. While they are a relatively easy group to access and analyze, one issue of concern is their generizability: given that college students are such an enormously diverse group, is it sensible to make generalizations about them? This question points out a potential drawback to using such large and heterogeneous groups as college students. 

*Probability sampling, randomization, and matching are methods of attaining comparability between the experimental and control groups.

*Randomization is the preferred method.

*However, randomization and matching may be used together.

'''Probability Sampling'''

*one begins with a sampling constant containing the entire population involved in the study. Then the researcher selects two samples that will be copies of each other.

*the degree of resemblance (representativeness) will be a product of the sample size.

*this type of sampling is seldom used in any experiment.

'''Randomization'''- a process for selecting people to be in a control or experimental group. Randomization is preferable because it limits the potential bias (systemic error) in the experiment, as it provides an equal likelihood that &quot;good&quot; and &quot;poor&quot; performers will be in the experimental group. However, there is still a chance that more of one category may end up in a given group. The best way to overcome this is a large sample size; hence, randomization is ideal when the population is very big.

-there are several ways of randomly selecting people for a control or experimental group; for example:
  1) Out of a sample of 1600, you can select every 8th person for each group. (selection rate of 1/8)
  2) Out of a sample of 100 you can select every other person to be in each group. (selection rate of 1/2; a higher rate yields a better likelihood for authenticity, and you can afford a higher rate when the sample size is small)
*Regardless of the way that the researcher decides to place subjects into each group, this process must be done in a fair and equal manner, because each sample will be a reflection of the total population's characteristics.

'''Matching'''
     Matching- a process in which subjects are paired based on the similarities of one or more variables. One member of the pair is assigned to the experimental group while the other is assigned to a control group.
*matching is a way to compare the experimental and control groups.

*matching is more efficient if a quota matrix is constructed for all of the relevant characteristics.
     Relevant characteristics - attributes that are related to the dependent variable.
*the overall average description of the experimental and control group should be the same.
*As a rule of thumb, both the control and experimental groups should have the same ages, gender and racial composition, etc.
'''Matching or Randomization?'''

''' Randomization over Matching'''
*a researcher may not be aware which variables are relevant for the matching process, and thus he should turn to randomization
*most statistical calculations that are used in analyzing results of experiments will all assume the randomization process is occurring.
'''Combining Randomization and Matching'''
*allows researchers to discover different ways of analyzing situations.

== Variations on Experimental Design ==

'''Pre-experimental Research Designs'''

*Donald Campbell and Juilan Stanley introduce three &quot;pre-experimental&quot; designs:
   1) One-Shot Case Study
     -a researcher measures a &quot;single group of subjects on a dependent variable following the administration of an independent
      variable&quot; (cite 238)
     -represents an everyday logical reasoning
   2) One Group Pre-test|Post-test Design
     -adds a pre-test for the experimental group but does not contain a control group.
     -is difficult to analyze because it &quot;suffers from the possibility that some factor other than the independent variable might
      cause a change between the pretest and post-test results.&quot; (cite 238)
     -describes with better evidence of influences of variables.
   3) Static Group Comparison
     -a research void of pretests for the experimental and control group.
     -uses data that will exactly pin-point the changes in a research.

== Validity Issues in Experimental Research ==

'''Sources of Internal Invalidity'''

     Internal Invalidity- explains that there is a possibility that conclusions gathered from experimental results may not precisely
     represent the occurrences in the experiment.
*Campbell, Stanley, and Thomas Cook pointed out several sources of internal invalidity:
   1) History
     -during the experiment historical events may occur. As a result the experimental results may be different.
   2) Maturation
     -because life is constantly changing people are influenced to do the same which can reflect in the experimental results.
   3) Testing
     -the processes of testing and re-testing may influence people's behavior.
   4) Instrumentation
     -since different ways of measuring variables are used in the pretest and post-test, how can we be sure that they are equally
      comparable.
   5) Statistical Regression
     -the group will show some improvement over time called ''regression to the mean''.
   6) Selection Biases
     -Comparisons do not have any meaning unless you have equally and fairly selected individuals for the experimental and control
      group.
   7) Experimental Morality
     -explains that results and outcomes maybe different due to people dropping out of the experiment before it is finished.
   8) Causal Time Order
     -confirms that A occurred before B, if we are trying to assert that A caused B
   9) Diffusion or Initiation of Treatments
     -results maybe different due to an uncontrollable interaction between the experimental and control group.
   10) Compensation
     -people in the control group are often denied sufficient resources that the experimental group are receiving.
   11) Compensatory Rivalry
     -the control group may try to work harder to make its groups results better than the experimental group results.
   12) Demoralization
     -feelings of incompleteness or less of a human in the control group may result in them giving up.

'''Sources of External Invalidity'''

     External Invalidity- explains the possibility that conclusions gathered from results may be a &quot;generalization about
     the ''real'' world.&quot;
*Campbell and Stanley describe four forms:
*''Soloman Four Group Design''
*four rules of interactions of pre-testing, post-testing, and variables.
*''Post-testing-Only Control Group Design''

Validity 
Internal validity 

– the ability to eliminate alternative explanations of the treatment effect 

- a combination of validity and reliability issues

- represents the possibility that the results of an experiment do not accurately reflect what occurred in the experiment

- classical experiments tend to eliminate all internal validity

External validity

- the ability to generalize experimental findings to events and settings outside the experiment itself

- results of the experiment may not translate to the real world

== Alternative Experimental Settings ==

'''Web-Based Experiments'''
*nowadays researchers are using the internet for conducting experiments.
Reasons:

    -cheaper
    -less time consuming
'''Natural Experiments'''
*often occur but not prominent

== Strengths and Weaknesses of the Experimental Method ==

'''Weaknesses'''

*artificial
   ex. what happens in the experiment may not take place in the ''real'' world.

'''Strengths'''
*isolation
   ex. the independent and dependent variable are isolated from one another in study. This makes changes easy to spot and
       conclusions to be drawn.

*relative ease of replication
*scientific rigor

== Ethics and Experiments ==

*experiments involve misleading subjects

*experiments may potentially cause harm to individuals

'''
&lt;u&gt;Avoid biased Items&lt;/u&gt;

An issue with prejudice is the lack of a correct definition. Given different circumstances, how prejudice is defined can be derived. Concerning questionnaires, '''bias''' is defined by the property of the question in-which encourages the respondent to answer in a particular way. Ex. &quot;Don't you agree with the CEO of Apple...&quot; would manipulate the question by promoting agreement with Apple's CEO. This bias usually would increase support in this situation, yet at the cost corrupting the results. An example of this would be:

&lt;u&gt;More support vs Less support&lt;/u&gt;

&quot;Halting rising crime rate&quot; vs &quot;Law enforcement&quot;;
&quot;Dealing with drug addiction&quot; vs &quot;Drug rehabilitation&quot;;
&quot;Scholarly financial support&quot; vs &quot;Financial aid&quot;

Furthering biasism, the ''social desirability'' regards questions and answers. In this case, people are more prone to respond with an answer that will make them look good. This can deter a participants revealing their true thoughts, especially when being questioned face-to-face. To counter this problem, a questioner should deter from asking inquires that makes the questioner feel  embarrassment, inhumane, perverted, stupid, or socially disadvantaged. The asking of hypothetical situations can also elicit biased responses due to the respondent answering a question that has no direct consequence on his/her being. The use of proper or specific names has also shown biases, with more positive valued names directed to men than woman.

Experiments involve taking action and then observing the consequences of that action. Experiments seek to answer the question: how do subjects change as a result of the experimental treatment? They fundamentally address causality; however, establishing causality in experiments is not necessarily an easy process. Experiments are infrequently used in sociology. Within the social sciences, they are more often used in social psychology. They are frequently used in the natural sciences and medicine.

Experiments are typically well-suited for projects that involve limited and well-defined concepts and propositions. They are better suited for explanatory purposes rather than descriptive ones. 

The classical experiment design serves as the foundation for all modern experiments. Major components of this method include independent and dependent variables, pre-testing and post-testing, and experimental and control groups.

Validity issues in experimental research - Internal validity refers to the possibility that the conclusions drawn  from experiment results may not accurately reflect  what went on in the experiment itself. External validity refers to the possibility that conclusions drawn from experimental results may not be generalizable to the &quot;real&quot; world.


Internal validity is the ability to eliminate alternative explanations of the treatment effect.  It is really a combination of validity and reliability issues.  Internal validity represents the possibility that conclusions drawn from experimental results may not accurately reflect what happened in the experiment itself.  Sources range from history, maturation, testing, instrumentation, statistical regression, selection bias, experimental mortality, causal time order, diffusion or imitation of treatments, compensation, compensatory rivalry, and demoralization.  Classic experimental designs eliminate virtually all threats to internal validity.  External validity – the ability to generalize experimental findings to events and settings outside the experiment itself.  It represents the possibility that conclusions drawn from experimental results may not be generalizable to the “real” world.  A general problem with experiments is that subjects are rarely recruited using probability sampling techniques. Another problem is the artificiality of the experimental setting.  Internal and external validity are both very important when it comes to experiments.

== Summary of the Classical Experiment ==
- Basis for all modern experiments

- Major components of classical experiment
* Independent and dependent variables
* Pre-testing and post-testing
* Experimental and control groups

In social research, experiments are a mode of scientific observation.  Experiments involve taking action and observing the consequence of that action.  Experiments are more appropriate for some topics and research purpose than others.  Experiments are especially well suited to research projects involving relatively limited and well defined concepts and propositions.  Because experiments focus on determining causation, they are also better suited to explanatory than to descriptive purposes.

The most conventional type of experiment involves three major pairs of components: independent and dependent variables, pretesting and posttesting, and experimental and control groups.  An experiment examines the effects of independent variable on a dependent variable.  The independent variable takes the form of an experimental stimulus which is either present or absent.  The experimenter compares what happens when the stimulus is present to what happens when it is not.  To be used in an experiment, both independent and dependent variables must be operationally defined and they must be operationally defined before the experiment begins.  

In experimental design subjects are measured in terms of a dependent variable which is called pretesting, exposed to a stimulus representing an independent variable, and then remeasured in terms of the dependent variable which is called posttesting.  Any difference between the first and last measurements on the dependent variable are then attributed to the independent variable.  Experimental group is a group of subjects to whom an experimental stimulus is administered in experimentation.  Control group is a group of subjects to whom no experimental stimulus is administered and who should resemble the experimental group in all other respects in experimentation.  The comparison of the control group and the experimental group at the end of the experiment points to the effect of the experimental stimulus.

'''Pre-testing:''' the measurement of a dependent variable along subjects

'''Post-testing:''' the measurement of a dependent variable among subjects after they have been exposed to an independent variable.
*Post testing allows researchers to measure if the experiment changed something

'''Hawthorne Effect:'''subjects perform better when in an experiment

'''Demand Characteristics:'''subjects try to give the answer they think is correct

'''Placebo Effect:''' subjects respond to the belief that they are receiving a drug

'''Experimental group:'''a group of subjects to whom the experimental stimulus is administered

'''Control group:'''a group of subjects to whom no experimental stimulus is administered but who should resemble the experimental group in all other respects

'''The Double-Blind Experiment:'''an experimental design in which neither the subjects nor the experimenters know which is the experimental and which is the control group

'''Selecting Subjects:'''
*'''Randomization:''' a technique for assigning experimental subjects to experimental and control groups
*'''Matching:''' the procedure whereby pairs of subjects are matched on the basis of their similarities on one or more variables and one member of the pair is assigned to the experimental group and the other to the control group
*'''Quota matrix:''' used to create experimental and control groups by finding pairs of matching subjects and assigning one to the experimental group and the other to the control group
'''Variations on Experimental Design'''
*'''One-shot case study: a single group of subjects is measured on a dependent variable following an experimental stimulus
*'''One-group pre-test post-test design:''' a pre-test is added for the experimental group, but lacks a control group
*'''Static-group comparison:''' includes experimental and control groups, but no pre-test

'''Validity in Experimental Design'''
*'''Internal Validity:''' the ability to eliminate alternative explanations of a treatment effect (i.e., a combination of validity and reliability issues). Internal validity represents the possibility that conclusions drawn from experimental results may not accurately reflect what happened in the experiment itself.

*'''External Validity:''' the ability to generalize experimental findings to events and settings outside the experiment itself. External validity represents the possibility that conclusions drawn from experimental results may not be generalizable to the real world.

'''Strengths of Experimental Method:'''
*Isolation of experimental variable's impact over time
*Replication
'''Weaknesses of Experimental Method:'''
*Artificiality of laboratory setting
*Cost
*Ethics



'''Ethics and Experiments'''
As with other methods for conducting social research, there are ethical considerations to take into account when creating and carrying out an experiment.
1) Deception should only be used if it is necessary for the purposes of the research; that is, it must be confirmed that there is no way of getting around the use of deception. Additionally, deception should only be used when the potential benefits of the research outweigh the risks of deceiving subjects. Using deception is considered an ethical violation, so its use must essential, and the research in which it is used must have the potential for valuable, implicative findings.
2) If it is necessary that the experiment is intrusive in some way in the participants' lives, considerations should be made so that they will not be physically or psychologically damaged. The potential value should, again, outweigh the possible risks of such intrusion in experiments.</text>

*If your system already has an outdated binary CGAL package installed (such as libcgal-dev) you best remove it with something like 'apt-get purge libcgal-dev'.

*If you custom-compiled BOOST, set the BOOST_ROOT environment variable to the installation location

*Download CGAL from [http://www.cgal.org] . Try to get the latest version. 

*CGAL requires boost, cmake, mpfr, and gmp to all be installed. The process at  [[OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Building_on_Linux/UNIX]] can help you install them. On Debian/Ubuntu, it will be something like this:

 sudo apt-get install libboost-dev cmake libmpfr-dev libgmp3-dev

*Extract
 tar -xf CGAL-*tar*

*Build 
 cd CGAL-$version
 cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/openscad_deps
 make
 sudo make install

*Note that some older systems, like NetBSD5, wont compile CGAL - either because CGAL wasn't ported to work with them or their compiler is too old or other reasons.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Isotope Dilution is the method of determining the isotope of interest by the addition of a 'tracer' isotope of known relative concentration.  The the ratio of tracer isotope to the isotope of interest is determined by mass spectrometry and therefore the concentration of the isotope of interest can be determined.

The '''Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event''', which occurred approximately 65.5 ([[Annum|Ma]]), was a large-scale [[extinction event|mass extinction]] of animal and plant species in a geologically short period of time. Widely known as the '''K–T extinction event''', it is associated with a geological signature known as the [[K–T boundary]], usually a thin band of sedimentation found in various parts of the world. ''K'' is the traditional abbreviation for the [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] derived from the German name ''Kreidezeit'', and ''T'' is the abbreviation for the [[Tertiary]] Period. The event marks the end of the [[Mesozoic]] Era and the beginning of the [[Cenozoic]] Era.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fortey&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Fortey|first= R |title=Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion Years of Life on Earth |publisher=Vintage |year=1999 |pages=238–260 |isbn=9780375702617}}&lt;/ref&gt; With &quot;Tertiary&quot; being discouraged as a formal time or rock unit by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]], the K–T event is now called the '''Cretaceous–Paleogene''' (or '''K–Pg''') '''extinction event''' by many researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gradstein|first= F|coauthors= Ogg J, Smith A |title=A Geologic Time Scale 2004 |url=http://www.cambridge.org/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521781426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orphaning pages ==

You recently restructured the contents of [[Japanese History]].  Up at the top-right of each page is a downward arrow.  If you hover over it you should get the option to move a page.  Please be sure to use that when restructuring.  There are pages that were part of the old contents linked from [[Template:Japanese HistoryTOC]] and thereby many of the pages of the book because they have {{tl|Japanese HistoryTOC}} on the bottom of them.  New pages need to have that navigation template on them and the navigation template should be updated.  However, several of the pages linked from that template and the old version of the contents are no longer linked from the main contents.  That is what is called &quot;orphaning&quot; a page.  It is not an acceptable replacement for requesting consensus for deletion from fellow contributors such as [[User:Rrgreen]] and marking the pages with {{tlx|delete|deletion discussion or reason}}. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 01:16, 20 January 2011 (UTC)

== Reply ==

Orphaning pages was entirely inadvertent. I didn't know how to undo it. My intention was simply to rename them. I had already decided that it was not a good idea to even try that when I saw your communication. I do not really want to assert ownership of any page where I am not actually ready to post text as it might easily be months before I get to some of them. I have complete backup for all text I have posted updated to include recent minor edits. If there is a mechanism to do so, I would have no objection to undoing all changes I made from the point where my attempts to reorganize the chapter titles caused trouble, after which I would replace any text that got lost as a result.--[[User:David L Davis|David L Davis]] ([[User talk:David L Davis|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/David L Davis|contribs]]) 19:27, 20 January 2011 (UTC)

:I have successfully reconciled the changes, with your additions integrated with the previous content.  I left a note for [[User:Rrgreen]] to hopefully encourage a collaboration discussion with you on that book, since you are both significant contributors.  After all, you did request assistance on the featured books nomination page. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 23:07, 20 January 2011 (UTC)

== additional comment ==

I have had time to look over what you have done and it is fine. Thank you very much. In the future I will be much more careful, and I plan to spend some time looking through the technical aspects of the organization of the books on this site so that I will have a better understanding of how to go about making changes. 

When I first found this site it had been populated long before by very simple stub material and then left untouched for a long time, so I concluded, like Columbus, that it was MINE, ALL MINE. I promise that I will make no more changes or deletions of material I did not write without consultation with anyone who shows up as a recent contributor.--[[User:David L Davis|David L Davis]] ([[User talk:David L Davis|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/David L Davis|contribs]]) 04:19, 21 January 2011 (UTC)</text>

== Preface ==

'''Formal Definition:''' Coordinate (algebraic) geometry is a branch of mathematics which combines techniques of abstract algebra, especially commutative algebra, with the language and the problems of geometry. 

'''Translation:''' Understanding the math behind the various features that appear on a graph, allowing one to rapidly, and accurately, draw complex graphs (with points of interest).

== Properties of Graphs ==

=== Asymptotes ===

==== Definition ====

Asymptotes are values which the graph approaches but does not touch. An asymptote is itself a graph and is categorized as follows:
* Vertical; A constant value (graph) on the horizontal axis (e.g. &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt;).
* Horizontal; A constant value (graph) on the vertical axis (e.g. &lt;math&gt;y = 1&lt;/math&gt;).
* Oblique (i.e. not Vertical or Horizontal); A non-constant graph (e.g. &lt;math&gt;y=x^2&lt;/math&gt;).

==== Comprehension ====

# Take a function &lt;math&gt;y=ax^m+ \frac{1}{bx^n}\ +c&lt;/math&gt;.
# As &lt;math&gt;x\to0, \frac{1}{bx^n}\ \to \infty, ax^m+c \to c&lt;/math&gt;
# The numerator (a function or a number, as is shown here: &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;) is divided by an extremely small number. Hence making the fraction an extremely large number.
# To understand why this happens grab any number, and divide it by an extremely small number (e.g. &lt;math&gt;10^{-30}&lt;/math&gt;)
# The value of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{bx^n}\ \to \infty&lt;/math&gt; overshadows the rest of the graph, namely the &lt;math&gt;ax^m+c \to c&lt;/math&gt;.
# Hence making &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{bx^n}\ &lt;/math&gt; an oblique (non-constant) asymptote, as it is approached by, but never actually touched by the graph due to the addition of &lt;math&gt;ax^m+c&lt;/math&gt; to every y value. This is in addition to the limit provided when &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt; which is not included in this graph, but must be if it exists on others (e.g. after polynomial division).
# As &lt;math&gt;x \to \infty, \frac{1}{bx^n}\ \to 0, ax^m+c \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;
# The numerator (a function or a number, as is shown here:&lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;) is divided by an extremely large number. Hence making the fraction an extremely small number.
# To understand why this happens grab any number, and divide it by an extremely large number (e.g. &lt;math&gt;10^{30}&lt;/math&gt;)
# The value of &lt;math&gt;ax^m+c \to \infty&lt;/math&gt; overshadows the rest of the graph, namely the &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{bx^n}\ \to 0 &lt;/math&gt;.
# Hence making &lt;math&gt;ax^m+c &lt;/math&gt; the oblique (non-constant) asymptote, as it is approached by, but never actually touched by the graph due to the addition of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{bx^n}\ &lt;/math&gt; to every y value.

=== Circles, Ellipses and Hyperbolas ===

==== Definition ====

===== Ellipses =====

'''General formula:'''

* &lt;math&gt;\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

'''General Notes:'''

* Point &lt;math&gt;(h,k)&lt;/math&gt; defines the ellipses center.
* Points &lt;math&gt;(\pm a + h,k)&lt;/math&gt; defines the ellipses domain, and horizontal endpoints - i.e. horizontal stretch.

* Points &lt;math&gt;(h,\pm b + k)&lt;/math&gt; defines the ellipses range, and vertical endpoints - i.e. vertical stretch.
===== Circles =====
'''General formula:''' 

*&lt;math&gt;(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2&lt;/math&gt;

'''General Notes:'''

* Point &lt;math&gt;(h,k)&lt;/math&gt; defines the circles center.
* Points &lt;math&gt;(\pm r + h,k)&lt;/math&gt; defines the circles domain - i.e. stretch.

* Points &lt;math&gt;(h,\pm r + k)&lt;/math&gt; defines the circles range - i.e. stretch.

* A circle is a subset of an ellipse, such that &lt;math&gt;a = b = r&lt;/math&gt;.

===== Hyperbolas =====

'''General formulae:'''  

* &lt;math&gt;\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} - \frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

'''General Notes:'''

* Point &lt;math&gt;(h,k)&lt;/math&gt; defines the hyperbolas center.

* Points &lt;math&gt;(\pm a + h,k)&lt;/math&gt; defines the hyperbolas domain, &lt;math&gt;[\pm a + h, \pm \infty)&lt;/math&gt;.

* The switch in positions of the fractions containing x and y, indicate the type of hyperbola - i.e. vertical or horizontal. The hyperbola is horizontal in the first, and negative in the second of the General hyperbolic formulae above.

* Graphs &lt;math&gt;y=\pm (\pm a + h,k)&lt;/math&gt; defines the hyperbolas domain &lt;math&gt;[\pm a + h, \pm \infty)&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Comprehension ====
Is unnecessary for these types of graphs, as the rules listed above are all that are needed. However the ability to recognize these graphs, in varying forms, is required and can be achieved via practice or can be found in [[VCE Specialist Mathematics/Units 3 and 4: Specialist Mathematics/Common Math Hacks/Coordinate Geometry|Coordinate Geometry]] section of [[VCE Specialist Mathematics/Units 3 and 4: Specialist Mathematics/Common Math Hacks|Common Math Hacks]].

=== Partial Fractions ===

==== Definition ====


==== Comprehension ====




==== Graphing Examples ====

===== General Steps =====

# Note the limits caused by a divide by 0.
# If possible (check the highest power of bottom and top), break up the complex function via polynomial division or partial fractions.
# If numerator's power is &lt;math&gt;&lt;&lt;/math&gt; the denominators power, utilize partial fractions.
# Otherwise if the numerator's power is &lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt; the denominators power, utilise polynomial division. 
# Add the resultant graphs, through the addition of ordinates method, to quickly determine what the graph looks like.
# Determine the asymptotes (Vertical, Horizontal, Oblique (i.e. a graph)).
# Determine other points of interest (Turning points (differentiation), Intercepts (let &lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;)).
# Draw the Graph using the above properties.

===== Partial Fractions =====

# Take a function: &lt;math&gt;y=\frac{3x+7}{x^2-2x-3}\ &lt;/math&gt;
# Notice that if &lt;math&gt;x^2-2x-3=0&lt;/math&gt;, hence &lt;math&gt;(x+1)(x-3)=0&lt;/math&gt;, you get a divide by 0. Hence &lt;math&gt; x\ne -1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; x\ne 3&lt;/math&gt;.
# Break up the function into partial fractions, and you arrive at &lt;math&gt;y=\frac{-1}{(x+1)}\ + \frac{4}{(x-3)}\ &lt;/math&gt;.
# Add the resultant graphs, through the addition of ordinates method, to quickly determine what the graph looks like.
# Notice that as &lt;math&gt;x\to -1, \frac{-1}{(x+1)}\ \to - \infty, \frac{4}{(x-3)}\ \to -1 &lt;/math&gt;. The fractional part, &lt;math&gt;\frac{-1}{(x+1)}\ &lt;/math&gt;, overshadows the rest of the equation, namely &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{(x-3)}\ &lt;/math&gt;. Hence a horizontal asymptote occurs when &lt;math&gt;x=-1&lt;/math&gt;.
# Notice that as &lt;math&gt;x\to 3, \frac{4}{(x-3)}\ \to \infty, \frac{-1}{(x+1)}\ \to \frac{-1}{4}\ &lt;/math&gt;. The fractional part, &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{(x-3)}\ &lt;/math&gt;, overshadows the rest of the equation, namely &lt;math&gt;\frac{-1}{4}\ &lt;/math&gt;. Hence a horizontal asymptote occurs when &lt;math&gt;x=3&lt;/math&gt;.
# Notice that as &lt;math&gt;x\to\infty, \frac{-1}{(x+1)}\ + \frac{4}{(x-3)}\  \to 0, y \to 0&lt;/math&gt;. Now the oblique (i.e. graph), &lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt;, overshadows the rest of the equation, namely &lt;math&gt;\frac{-1}{(x+1)}\ + \frac{4}{(x-3)}\ &lt;/math&gt;. Hence the oblique asymptote occurs when &lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt;.
# Determine points of interest:
## When &lt;math&gt;y=0, x = \frac{-7}{3}\ &lt;/math&gt;, hence there are no x-intercepts (C is the complex field) in the real plane.
## When &lt;math&gt;x=0, y = \frac{-7}{3}\ &lt;/math&gt;.
## When &lt;math&gt;y'=0, x=-5 or x=\frac{1}{3}\ , y= \frac{-1}{4}\ or \frac{-9}{4}\ &lt;/math&gt;
# Draw the graph.

===== Polynomial Division =====

# Take a function: &lt;math&gt;y=3x+7 + \frac{x^3 + 19x^2 + 116x +224}{x(x+4)(x+7)}\ &lt;/math&gt;
# Notice that if &lt;math&gt;x(x+4)(x+7)=0&lt;/math&gt;, you get a divide by 0. Hence &lt;math&gt; x\ne 0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; x\ne -4&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; x\ne -7&lt;/math&gt;
# Break up the function, and divide through, using polynomial division, and you arrive at &lt;math&gt;y=3x+7 + \frac{x+8}{x}\ &lt;/math&gt;.
# Add the resultant graphs, through the addition of ordinates method, to quickly determine what the graph looks like.
# Notice that as &lt;math&gt;x\to0, \frac{x+8}{x}\ \to \infty, 3x+7 \to 7 &lt;/math&gt;. The fractional part, &lt;math&gt;\frac{x+8}{x}\ &lt;/math&gt;, overshadows the rest of the equation, namely &lt;math&gt;3x+7&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the horizontal asymptote occurs when &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;.
# Notice that as &lt;math&gt;x\to\infty, \frac{x+8}{x}\ \to 0, y \to 3x+7&lt;/math&gt;. Now the oblique (i.e. graph), &lt;math&gt;3x+7&lt;/math&gt;, overshadows the rest of the equation, namely &lt;math&gt;\frac{x+8}{x}\ &lt;/math&gt;. Hence the oblique asymptote occurs when &lt;math&gt;y=3x+7&lt;/math&gt;.
# Determine points of interest:
## When &lt;math&gt;y=0, x \in \mathbb{C} &lt;/math&gt;, hence there are no x-intercepts (C is the complex field) in the real plane.
## When &lt;math&gt;x=0, y \uparrow &lt;/math&gt;, hence there are no y-intercepts (&lt;math&gt;\uparrow&lt;/math&gt; indicates that the previous statement is undefined.)
## When &lt;math&gt;y'=0, x=\pm \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3}\ , y=8\pm4\sqrt{6}&lt;/math&gt;
# Draw the graph.

RapidSMS is a Free Software SMS Applications framework written in Python with Django.

This book is intended to RapidSMS developers or RapidSMS Developers to be.

Since most of the latter have no Python nor Django experience, this book briefly describes those concepts but requires the user to continue with official documentations.
Basic Web programming skills are required.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following describes how to install RapidSMS in a Virtual Machine (VM) while working on a Windows machine.
This setup is suitable for both production and development.

For Linux users, simply follow inside-VM instructions or follow the regular instructions with Virtual Box.

|}

== Virtual Machine, Setup &amp; Configuration ==

Once all above softwares are ready, launch Virtualbox follow the Wizard:
# Press NEW to create a new virtual machine.
# Press NEXT on Welcome screen.
# Enter a name for your virtual machine (Ex. ''RapidSMS''), choose ''Linux'' as an operating system type and ''Ubuntu'' as its version.
# Press NEXT, Choose the amount of memory you want the virtualbox to use (256M is fine).
# Press NEXT, Leave the Boot Hard Disk (Primary Master) checked.
# Press NEXT, New wizard will appear.
## Leave the storage type (Dynamically expanding storage )
## Choose the size of Storage that VirtualBox will use (8G is fine).
# Press Next, then Finish.

Now choose the Virtual machine you created from the above steps (''RapidSMS''), right-click on it and choose settings.
# Go ''Storage'' tab. On Storage Tree, Select the non-hard disk drive.
## On attribute pane, select CD/DVD Device and add the ''Ubuntu Server'' ISO you downloaded.
# On Network Tab:
## ''Adapter1'': Check Enable Network Adapter Box.
## On field ''attached to'', choose ''Host-only Adapter''.
## ''Adapter2'': check Enable Network Adapter Box	
## On field ''attached to'' , choose ''Bridged Adapter''
## On field ''Name'', Choose the Network card on which you have internet.
# Close and save the settings for the VM.
# Now, click on File -&gt; Preferences from the main Virtual Box Menu
## On Network tab, set your Adapter and ip address (ex. 192.168.10.1) and network mask (Ex. 255.255.255.0).
## On DHCP sub-tab, Disable DHCP Server.

Now start you virtual machine that you configured by clicking on START.

After Starting your Virtual machine, your operating system (in our case Ubuntu) will starts.

We'll need to install some software inside Ubuntu to configure our RapidSMS and run it properly.

== Network Cards Configuration ==

The above configuration set up two Network Interfaces in the VM:
* The Host-Only one, which we'll use to access the VM at all time.
* The bridged one, which we'll use to access Internet from the VM and expose the RapidSMS server on the network.

To configure the network in the VM, we need to edit the ''interfaces'' file:

&lt;pre&gt;sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces&lt;/pre&gt;

Inside this file write the following 
&lt;pre&gt;
# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
	address 192.168.10.20
	netmask 255.255.255.0

auto eth1
iface eth1 inet dhcp
&lt;/pre&gt;

Save the file ('':x'') and restart the network service:

&lt;pre&gt;sudo /etc/init.d/networking  restart&lt;/pre&gt;

== Python Packages ==

RapidSMS requires several softwares. The following command will download and install required softwares (~40MB).

  sudo apt-get install aptitude

  sudo aptitude install gettext git-core python python-pybabel python-serial \
  python-setuptools python-tz python-mysqldb python-pysqlite python python-pysqlite2 \
  sqlite sqlite3


The following command will install some additional librairies (~100MB). Optional.

  sudo aptitude install python-reportlab pdftk python-matplotlib python-xlwt

The following will install ''PEP8'', a tool to ensure Python Coding Standards are met.

  sudo easy_install pep8

The following generates locales files in the VM.
Add all the locale you might want to use for translation (you can do this after). Following are for French, English (USA) and Arabic (Jordan) in order.

  sudo locale-gen fr_FR.UTF-8
  sudo locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
  sudo locale-gen ar_JO.UTF-8

== Samba Installation &amp; Configuration ==

Installing and configuring Samba will provide us a way to directly write inside-VM files from within Windows, using regular Windows Text Editors.

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo aptitude install samba smbfs	
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
&lt;/pre&gt;

Add the following at the end of the file
&lt;pre&gt;
Security = share
[rsms]
comment = RapidSMS Dev
path = /home/{your ubuntu username}
public = yes
writable = yes
create mask = 0644
directory mask = 0755
force user ={your username}
force group = {your username}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Close file and restart Samba:

&lt;pre&gt;sudo service samba restart&lt;/pre&gt;

On Windows, you can now access your home folder (''/home/&lt;username&gt;'') at the following URL: '''\\192.168.10.20\rsms'''.

You can map this folder to a Drive Letter on Windows to access it easily (works only when the VM is started).

== RapidSMS Dependencies ==

Following [[../Code_Structure|Code Structure]], we will now create a ''sources'' folder to store all third-parties dependencies.

&lt;pre&gt;
cd ~
mkdir sources
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Django Web Framework ===

After extracting the Django 1.1.1 archive (see download link under [[#System Requirements | System Requirements]]), copy Django-1.1.1 folder to ''sources''.

Then, change to that directory and install it
&lt;pre&gt;
cd ~/sources/Django-1.1.1
sudo python ./setup.py install
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== RapidSMS Core Library ===

RapidSMS main fork (core) is located at [http://github.com/rapidsms/rapidsms github.com/rapidsms/rapidsms].

Clone the code and install it:
&lt;pre&gt;
cd ~/sources
git clone git://github.com/rapidsms/rapidsms.git
cd rapidsms
sudo python ./setup.py install
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now, RapidSMS is installed.

=== Other Third Party Applications ===

Numerous RapidSMS applications are not located into the core. There are available from their developers's repositories.

In case you want to use some, clone those repositories in ''sources'' folder then link the applications as explained in [[../Personal Repository|Personal Repository]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">As mentioned in [[../Code Structure|Code Structure]], our main place of work will be a new folder.

Start by creating this folder:
&lt;pre&gt;cd ~
mkdir sms
&lt;/pre&gt;

This folder will need to follow some guidance. It will be your RapidSMS home. From now, unless specified, we always consider to be inside this folder and it will be called your ''repository''.

== local.ini file ==
''local.ini'' file is the main rapidsms configuration file. It includes rapidsms-specific config, apps-specific config and backend-specific config.
It is actually overwriting the default ''rapidsms.ini'' file from the core.

The Django configuration is not directly accessible as it is stored inside rapidsms core.

Create a file named ''local.ini'' and add the following content:
&lt;pre&gt;
[rapidsms]
    apps=logger,admin,webapp,ajax,httptester,echo
    backends=http

[log]
    level=debug
    file=/tmp/rapidsms.log

[database]
    engine=sqlite3
    name=rapidsms.db

[http]
    host=localhost
    port=1338

[httptester]
    host=localhost
    port=1338

&lt;/pre&gt;

the required ''[sections]'' are ''rapidsms'' and ''database''.
''apps='' is a comma separated list of all the rapidsms apps you want to use. The above list will allow you to test the system via the web interface.
''backends='' is a comma separated list of the backends to start. A backend is a module that handles incoming/outgoing message. Most popular is ''gsm'' backend (also called ''pygsm'') which sends/receives messages via a physically connected GSM modem. In the above example, we use the ''http'' backend which allows you to fake the behavior of a modem to test incoming/outgoing message.

In RapidSMS, you can configure apps (and backends) from the ''local.ini'' file by creating a section for it.

The ''[http]'' section configures the ''http'' backend. the ''[httptester]'' section configures the httptester app. Use the same host and port for both ''httptester'' and ''http'' for the HTTP Tester App to work.

== apps folder ==

RapidSMS expects an ''apps'' folder inside.
&lt;pre&gt;mkdir apps&lt;/pre&gt;

== __init__.py ==

Since both your repository are included in ''PYTHON_PATH'', they are considered Python modules.
You thus need to create an empty ''__init__.py'' file inside both to mark them as modules.

&lt;pre&gt;
touch __init__.py
touch apps/__init__.py''
&lt;/pre&gt;

== manage.py / rapidsms script ==

Every Django app includes a ''manage.py'' script which gives access to Django-related operations: creating database, etc.
RapidSMS requires a modified version of that script to launch the ''router''.

Create a file named ''rapidsms'' with the following content:
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env python
# vim: ai ts=4 sts=4 et sw=4 encoding=utf-8

import sys, os
from os import path

# figure out where all the extra libs (rapidsms and contribs) are
libs=[os.path.abspath('lib'),os.path.abspath('apps')] # main 'rapidsms/lib'
try:
    for f in os.listdir('contrib'):
        pkg = path.join('contrib',f)
        if path.isdir(pkg) and \
                'lib' in os.listdir(pkg):
            libs.append(path.abspath(path.join(pkg,'lib')))
except:
    # could be several reasons:
    # no 'contrib' dir, 'contrib' not a dir
    # 'contrib' not readable, in any case
    # ignore and leave 'libs' as just
    # 'rapidsms/lib'
    pass

# add extra libs to the python sys path
sys.path.extend(libs)

# import manager now that the path is correct
from rapidsms import manager

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    manager.start(sys.argv)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Make sure it has execution rights.
&lt;pre&gt;
chmod +x ./rapidsms
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Linking third-parties apps ==

In ''local.ini'' file, we requested several apps to be started.
RapidSMS expects those apps to be located in your ''apps/'' subfolder, just like any regular app.

Create symlinks as follow to include them in your repository:

&lt;pre&gt;
cd apps
ln –s  /home/user_name/sources/rapidsms/apps/admin
ln –s  /home/user_name/sources/rapidsms/apps/ajax
ln –s  /home/user_name/sources/rapidsms/apps/locations
ln –s  /home/user_name/sources/rapidsms/apps/logger
ln –s  /home/user_name/sources/rapidsms/apps/patterns
ln –s  /home/user_name/sources/rapidsms/apps/reporters
ln –s  /home/user_name/sources/rapidsms/apps/webapp
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Database ==

RapidSMS, like Django is database driven.

=== Creating the database ===

From the ''local.ini'' file, you specified database connection information. There, just like with Django, you can select different engines (MySQL, SQLite, etc).

Once configured, use the ''syncdb'' command of the ''rapidsms'' script:

&lt;pre&gt;
./rapidsms syncdb
&lt;/pre&gt;

This command will create the database schema of all the apps named in ''local.ini'', according to the Django/Models convention. If this command fails with a message about a parser error, modify your local.ini files so that you remove the leading spaces/tabs in the lines that start without a bracket.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section explains how to localize your application.
This describes how switch from one language (code language, usually English) to another language. If you want to serve multiple languages at the same this, do it yourself.

== Changing your code to support Localization ==

Create a new directory inside your app and name it ''locale''. In our case: we create ''apps/survey/locale''

Import needed packages to translate our text in each file which contains text strings or messages to be translated.

In ''app.py'' and ''models.py'' we have to import the gettext translation lib from django and from it we need the ugettext function.: 

&lt;pre&gt;
from django.utils.translation import ugettext as _
&lt;/pre&gt;  

We give an alias for ugettext:  '''_''' to make the code more clear and easier to write.

Note: it is recommended in models and GUI to import ''ugettext_lazy'' function instead of ''ugettext''

For each message you want to translate, make a call to the ''_()'' function, passing it the text. For instance :
&lt;pre&gt;
message.respond(u&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
message.respond(_(u&quot;Hello World !&quot;))
&lt;/pre&gt;

To translate a message with parameters, make sure you only translate the format, not the evaluated string :

&lt;pre&gt;
message.respond(u&quot;Thank you %s. for your opinion&quot; % lname)
message.respond(_(u&quot;Thank you %s. for your opinion&quot;) % lname)
&lt;/pre&gt;

If Django finds this sentence in the file django.mo file (See bellow) it will retrieve the corresponding translation otherwise it will take the default text which is the original one.

== Creating the translation file ==

Once you have marked all your strings as translatable in your app, create a translation file using the following command:

&lt;pre&gt;
cd apps/myapp
mkdir locale
django-admin.py makemessages –l ar 
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the previous example, ''myapp'' is the name of the app you are translating and ''ar'' is the language code of your target language.

In the ''locale'' folder Django will create a new folder named after the language code (''ar'' here) with an ''LC_MESSAGES'' subfolder which itself contains a file named ''django.po''.

This file is the file to be translated. That's the one you can share with a translator.
 
Each time you create or modify message new translatable strings in your app, re-issue the ''makemessages'' command to to update .po file.

== Translation ==

Open django.po file and translate your text for each message like:

&lt;pre&gt;
msgid &quot;Thank you %s. for your opinion”
msgstr &quot;شكرا لك %s. لمشاركتنا رأيك&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;


* ''msgid'': the original message “default language”
* ''msgstr'': the corresponding translation.

'''Note''': It is '''mandatory''' to keep all formating parameters (''%s'', ''%d'', ''%(key)s'', etc) from the original to the translation. For Arabic translation, ''%s'' must appear like this, not ''s%''.

== Compiling the translation ==

Django doesn't use the ''dango.po'' file. It uses a compiled version of it: ''django.mo''.
To compile your ''.po'' file, use the following command:

&lt;pre&gt;
django-admin.py compilemessages
&lt;/pre&gt;

This command will create .mo file which is the one used by Django and rapidsms to display localized strings.

Relaunch the command everytime you update the tranlation ''.po'' file to see the changes.

== Enabling localized version == 

To be able to use your localized version, your need to configure RapidSMS to use that language.

This is done using the ''bonjour'' app. [[../Installation/|Link it]] if you haven't then add it to your ''local.ini'' ''apps='' list.

Lastly, you need to configure ''bonjour'' in ''local.ini'' to specify the language code:
&lt;pre&gt;
[bonjour]
lang=ar
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <comment>/* Proposed Methods to Achieve Quality */ -- Minor cleanup</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{split}}

A high-quality software application makes its users happy. They enjoy using it and it doesn't get in their ways. It yields the right results quickly, without requiring workarounds for bugs, does not crash or hogs the system, and allows the users to go on with the rest of their lives. Either the program is invisible to them and they don't think about using it, or it works so well that they enjoy using it and possibly comment about it to their friends.

On the other hand, a software application of poor quality annoys, irritates and/or frustrates its users, or even causes them to lose a lot of time, money or worse. Either it is too slow and they lose patience waiting for it to perform its function. Or it crashes a lot or hogs the system. Or it could look ugly, or have a poorly designed user-interface. Or it has other bugs like those causing data loss. Whatever its faults are, it fails or partially fails to be a useful tool in the hand of the user.

As software developers, it is our mission to make sure the software we produce is high-quality so it will perform its function properly without inflicting anguish or loss upon the user.

Now we can ask two questions:

# What makes software high-quality?
# How to make sure our software is indeed of high quality?

The answer to the first question is more straightforward: the Wikipedia has an article about [[wikipedia:Software quality|Software quality]], and [http://www.shlomifish.org/ Shlomi Fish] has written [http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/high-quality-software/rev2/ an essay titled &quot;What Makes Software High-Quality?&quot;] enumerating many of the aspects of good software applications. Most end-users can tell if a program is high-quality by working with it and testifying what they think of it (though naturally, different people may uncover different aspects of what makes or does not make the software work for them.).

Once we got that question out of our way, we can now focus on the second question: how can we make sure our software is high-quality. This will be the subject of this book. This question or the various aspects of it have been the subject of countless of books, papers, articles, blog posts and others writing. In this book, we will attempt to cover all the bases and give the various opinions on each aspect of the various proposed methods to achieve high-quality programs. After all, ask two software developers about some aspect of software engineering and you'll get three different answers.

== Proposed Methods to Achieve Quality ==

=== Reuse Existing Efforts ===

The first rule of writing a good program is &quot;Don't write it yet.&quot;. Instead, look for an existing effort that accomplishes all or most of what you want to do, and make use of it. The tendency of software shops to re-implement existing software poorly has been nicknamed the &quot;Not Invented Here&quot; syndrome (or NIH for short). If you can reuse existing code to do what you want, then you will finish much more quickly.

An existing effort may not always be suitable for use due to pricing, licensing, legal or other aspects. For example, many open-source projects have re-implemented proprietary software: OpenSSH was an open-source implementation of the SSH protocol's client and server which already had a proprietary implementation; GNU Octave is a clean-room implementation of the proprietary Matlab; the KDE and GNOME desktops (and later XFCE) aimed to provide open-source alternatives to the proprietary CDE desktop ; and so on. The developers of GnuTLS had to start a clean-room re-implementations of OpenSSL because OpenSSL had a problematic (but still open source) licence which is not compatible with the GPL licence favoured by the GNU project. And this goes on.

Sometimes a given software package may be too buggy to salvage, may not match the target platform (operating system, programming language, processor architecture, virtual machine, etc.) and as a result may be quicker to re-implement. Despite all that, one can usually find something close enough to serve as the basis for the task they need to solve and can re-use this code.

==== Against Code Reuse ====

Joel Spolsky wrote in his &quot;Joel on Software&quot; site an essay titled [http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000007.html In Defense of the Not-Invented-Here Syndrome] in which he concludes by saying &quot;If it's a core business function -- do it yourself, no matter what.&quot;.

==== How to find reusable code ====

Some good sources for finding already-written software include, but note that a large amount of this code may be licensed under licences, such as the [[wikipedia:GNU General Public License|GNU General Public License]] that are incompatible with some use by &quot;shrinkwrap&quot; non-open-source software (so called &quot;proprietary software&quot;)

# Software directories such as [[wikipedia:Freshmeat|Freshmeat]] or [[wikipedia:Free Software Directory|the Free Software Foundation's Free Software Directory]]
# Open Source Software Development Hubs (&quot;Forges&quot;) such as [[wikipedia:SourceForge|SourceForge]].
# Generic web search engines such as [[wikipedia:Google search|Google search]].
# The package repositories of various [[wikipedia:Linux distribution|Linux distributions]], and other distributions or operating systems.
# Collections of packages for various languages or platforms such as the Perl programming language's [[wikipedia:CPAN|CPAN]] (the &quot;Comprehensive Perl Archive Network&quot;). 

Normally searching using a good search engine (by trying several keywords) and on Freshmeat would be enough. If you still want to be sure, you can try asking whether anyone can point you to such a program in a relevant channel in a popular [[wikipedia:Internet Relay Chat|Internet Relay Chat (IRC)]] network such as [[wikipedia:Freenode|Freenode]] or differnet kinds of Internet forums.

=== Writing Functional Specifications ===

Functional specifications are design documents that aim to explain how the end-user will interact with the program, and how the program will respond. Joel Spolsky has a [http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000036.html 4-part series on his Joel on Software site about writing functional specifications], where he has given the why's and how's of writing functional specifications. In addition, one can find the following open-content functional specifications for some open source projects:

# [http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/web-cpan/App-Freelancers-Board-Yonathan/trunk/docs/functional-spec/App-Freelancer-Board-Yonathan-functional-spec.txt Functional Spec for a Freelancers Board] (with a Biblical theme).
# [http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/web-cpan/CPAN-Module-Classification/trunk/docs/functional-spec-for-CPAN-Classification-Proposal.txt Functional Spec for a better classification of CPAN Modules] (with a theme of FOSS world  celebrities).
# [http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/winapt/winapt/trunk/docs/design/functional-spec.txt Functional Spec for a Windows package management system] (featuring characters from [http://www.ozyandmillie.org/ Ozy and Millie]).

==== Opinions Against Functional Specifications ====

Some people believe that the time it takes to write and prepare a functional specification is better spent writing code (for their defense, one should note that writing them is much less time consuming than writing other design documents such as comprehensive technical specifications). In the context of open-source software, functional specifications may not agree with the recommendations of [[:wikipedia:The Cathedral and the Bazaar|The Cathedral and the Bazaar]] series in which Eric S. Raymond claims that a programmer should work on a limited working version on his own before they can start developing it in a Bazaar style.

=== Code Design ===

Code design is an initial mental effort done to plan the way the code will evolve into the future. There are many ways to do design: by writing technical specifications (possibly not very comprehensive), by writing documentation before code, by doing design meetings with the team, by thinking, by writing notes, by preparing diagrams, etc. Most software developers when confronted with the question, will agree that it is a good idea to design code well before writing it, as fixing badly designed code may be much more costly in time.

Some schools of software engineering (such as Extreme Programming) note that regardless of how much design is handed to the actual programmer, he or she will still need to do a minimal amount of design themselves, such as deciding how to structure the internals of subroutines, or how to name a temporary variable.

==== Opposing views on how to design ====

The Extreme Programming methodology tends to look down on doing a &quot;Big Design Upfront&quot;, where the application is designed down to minute details, claiming it will likely prove to be wrong at implementation time, will likely waste a lot of time, and will tend to make the underling programmers feel like they are being patronised. Instead it advocates a weekly design meeting where the future directions of the code are decided upon.

'''TODO''': Add more.

=== Refactoring code and rewriting it ===

'''Refactoring''' is the process of improving the internal quality of the code (or its elegance) without changing its external behaviour. As understood from the &quot;Refactoring&quot; book by Martin Fowler (and from previous experience of people with &quot;cleaning up&quot; code), refactoring can be done by applying several well-understood transformations to the existing codebase, while preserving its integrity at every point, requiring very little effort and with relatively little risk of breaking the code.

In addition to refactoring, some programmers sometimes feel the need to '''rewrite''' portions of the code, which they deem as either completely inelegant or alternatively not fulfilling the tasks needed by the code's new functionality. An extreme form of such rewriting is starting the project entirely from scratch in what became known as a '''complete rewrite'''.

'''TODO''': add Joel's &quot;Things you Should Never Do, Part I&quot;, and &quot;Rub a dub dub&quot;, the discussion about rewriting in the ack-users mailing list.

=== Having Testers ===

=== Hiring the Best Developers ===

As explained before, ''local.ini'' is the RapidSMS configuration file.

Edit it to change the behavior of RapidSMS and ensure it will run:

* change the order of items in ''apps='' as this is the order in which every message is passed to every apps.
* change the list of backends in ''backends=''. Router will fail if you name gsm backend but have no modem attached for example.
* verify the list of apps and their dependencies. httptester for example requires webapp.
* make sure you are sending the logs to a file as looking at the logs is the main troubleshooting method.

== Start the router ==

RapidSMS router is the main component of RapidSMS. Its process will start all the configured backends and apps.

Backends will then start to loop over their resources and send ''Message'' objects to the router as those are received.

When a message is received, the router will call each app for them to handle it.

Start the router:

&lt;pre&gt;
./rapidsms route
&lt;/pre&gt;

The router outputs messages depending on the configuration of the log level. The same output is written to the log file, should this one be configured.

== Start the web server ==

The web-server (Django's) is optional but most of the time is wanted.
It ensures that apps with a web interface are accessible, such as the Django admin and the Message logger.

Start the web server:
&lt;pre&gt;
./rapidsms runserver IP:PORT
&lt;/pre&gt;

Replace IP with your local IP to which restrict access to that webserver and the port on which it will respond to requests.

By default (if you omit IP and PORT), rapidsms will use ''127.0.0.1:8000'''.

If you want to use default HTTP port on all interfaces, use:
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ./rapidsms runserver 0.0.0.0:80
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that you need to have super user privileges to use ports below 1024.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Admin User Interface is a Django feature.
It creates automaticaly an Admin U.I from your models which allows registered users to
* Add record for Models
* Edit records for Models
* Delete records for Models

== Enabling Django admin in RapidSMS ==

As RapidSMS doesn't gives access to the Django ''settings.py'' file, we need to manually enable the Django admin (whether we want admin support for our own Models or not).

The easiest way is to include the ''admin'' app from the RapidSMS repository. See [[../Installation|Installation]].

You will then have access to Django admin at ''/admin/'' URL on your web server. Use the credentials you used during the first ''syncdb'' to log-in.

== Add Django Admin Support ==

Inside your App, create a file named ''admin.py''.

''admin.py'' must include the following minimum statements to work:
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env python
# encoding=utf-8

from django.contrib import admin
from myapp import models

admin.site.register(MyModel)
&lt;/pre&gt;
In this example, we are enabling Django admin for the model ''MyModel'' of our ''myapp'' App.

You can now edit your Model's data from the Admin U.I.

== Improving Model Admin U.I ==

One Django feature that most RapidSMS apps are using is Customized Admin for Models.

It allows features like content filtering, enhanced display or search.

Example:
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env python
# encoding=utf-8

from django.contrib import admin
from models import Person, Activity

class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):

    list_display = ('name', 'age', 'sex_name', 'activity', 'entered_on')
    list_filter = ('activity', 'sex')
    ordering = [('-entered_on')]
    search_fields = ['first_name', 'last_name', 'activity__name']

admin.site.register(Person, PersonAdmin)
&lt;/pre&gt;

This example registers a custom Admin Model for the ''Person'' Model.
* List of records will display the properties from the ''list_display'' tuple.
* List of records can be filtered by activity or sex.
* List of records will be ordered by entered_on (DESC) by default
* List of records will present a search box which can search on fields given.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In web views, usually we want to represent some feature of our app to be viewed in a web page dynamically such as statistics, reports or even data manipulation.

== Views ==

In your app create a new file and name it ''views.py'' , in our case inside ''app/survey''

A view receives an http request and returns http response
We import the class HttpResponse, which lives in the django.http module

&lt;pre&gt;
from django.http import HttpResponse
&lt;/pre&gt;

Inside views we define the functions that will take http request as parameter , the view returns an HttpResponse  object that contains the generated response. Each view function is responsible for returning an HttpResponse object.
so we define our index function as the following :
&lt;pre&gt;
from django.http import HttpResponse
from models import Survey

def index (request):    
    result = Survey.objects.all()
       
    return  render_to_response(request,'survey/index.html',{'allrecords':result})
&lt;/pre&gt;

This function simply retrieves data objects from the models (dataBase) and pass them to template to be displayed in a well format view.
&lt;pre&gt;
    render_to_response(template[, dictionary][, context_instance][, mimetype])
&lt;/pre&gt;
   
Renders a given template with a given context dictionary and returns an HttpResponse object with that rendered text.

For more details please visite :[http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.1/topics/http/views/#topics-http-views django views]

== URLS mapping file ==

In your app create new file ''urls.py'' which will be a simple mapping between urls patterns and a call back function (our views)
In this file import urls defaults and the views from our views that we have just created:
&lt;pre&gt;
from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
import views
&lt;/pre&gt;

we should configure urls file to customize our views :
We have tow views in our app/ survey :
Main view views.index  and views.profile
&lt;pre&gt;
urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^survey/?$', views.index),
    url(r'^survey/(\d+)/?$', views.profile, name='profile')
)
&lt;/pre&gt;
Patterns is available from django config  urls  defaults , we passe the first parameter as empty and we passe other parameters as needed

The 'r' in front of each regular expression string is optional but recommended. It tells Python that a string is &quot;raw&quot;

'''\d ''' appeared in the group regular expression is a parameter that we passe to profile view

== Templates ==
Template is a text file that can generates any text-based format as (html,xml,..)
Template can contains a variables which you will replace their values in your code
variable looks like this: {{  allrecords }}.Template compiler will evaluates that variable and replaces it with the result.

We have to create a template were we will write html code to view the data as reports or statistics or any thing that we want to display in our web application.

Create a new folder in your app and name it ''template''. 

'' apps/survey/template ''

Inside this folder create your template  .html  files.

index.html, profile.html

Template example :
&lt;pre&gt;
{% extends base_template %}
{% block content %}
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt; Survey result &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summery &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Number of records &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; {{allrecords.count()}}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; First name&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; {{allrecords.firstName}}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
{% endblock %}
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Template inheritance ==

To reuse Django's template is template inheritance. Template inheritance allows you to build a base &quot;skeleton&quot; template that contains all the common elements of your site and defines blocks that child templates can override.
we put our code inside blocks to inhert from django main template as below.
&lt;pre&gt;
{% extends base_template %}
{% block content %}

……

{% endblock %}
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">It’s rapidsms message parsing library for the message resaved from route,.
to use it you shod import the library from rapidsms library as:
    from rapidsms.parsers.keyworder import Keyworder
then create an instant from it :  
    keyword = Keyworder ()
the Keyworder class have two important behavior;  prefix, regexp
the prefix behavior use to parsing the first word user sends to guide the execution path like switch statement 
    keyword. Prefix = [‘help’]     
when user send message and it start with ‘help’ the interpreter will execute the code come after; the same way you call block.
After satisfy the prefix we should define the expected format for the message resaved to deter main which function to call and it done by:
   @keyword(r’ ''the regular excretion'' ’) 
for example:
   @keyword(r'(\w+) (\w+) (\w+) ([0-9]+) (\w+)') 
mean after prefix handle if the string contains the exact format it will call the function on the same block which contain 5 parameter 4 word and one number on the same order

      <comment>/* Django Admin */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== App structure ==

A RapidSMS App is a Django app which includes some RapidSMS-specific files and follows some conventions.
A Typical app would look like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
__init__.py
app.py
models.py
admin.py
views.py
urls.py
static/
templates/
&lt;/pre&gt;

A minimal app would contain:

&lt;pre&gt;
__init__.py
app.py
&lt;/pre&gt;

* ''app.py'': SMS code
* ''models.py'': Django models (database)
* ''admin.py'': Django admin
* ''views.py'': Django view (web interface)
* ''urls.py'': Djangi URL patterns (for web interface)
* ''static/'': folder containing static files for web interface. Accessible at ''http://&lt;server&gt;/static/&lt;appname&gt;/''
* ''templates'': Django templates

== SMS Code ==

An App's SMS code is composed of a rapidsms.app.App class which will be instantiated and called by the router.

Skeleton of a ''app.py'':

&lt;pre&gt;
import rapidsms

class App(rapidsms.app.App):

    def parse(self, message):
        pass

    def handle(self, message):
        pass
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== How it works ? ===

The router, launched by the route command, instantiates all the App's ''App'' classes.
This is done in the order of the ''apps='' string in ''local.ini'' ; then it calls the ''start'' method of each, then the ''configure'' message of each.

Once a message is received, it follows the following procedure:

# call ''parse'' method of each App, passing it the ''Message'' object.
# class ''handle'' method of each App, passing it the ''Message'' object.

Once one of the ''handle'' method return ''True'', the message is considered handled and thus not passed to the other apps. That's why order matters.

=== Configuring your App ===

RapidSMS offers the ability to add some configuration for your app in the ''local.ini'' file.
In your ''local.ini'', add a section for your app with key-value peers.

Example for a ''test'' app:
&lt;pre&gt;
[test]
country=ml
&lt;/pre&gt;

Adding such configuration will have the router call the ''configure'' method of the ''test'' App during startup. Make sure your app has a ''configure'' method that can answer to it :
&lt;pre&gt;
    def configure(self, country):
        pass
&lt;/pre&gt;

or

&lt;pre&gt;
    def configure(self, **kwargs):
        pass
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that all arguments are passed as strings.

=== Message Object ===

The ''Message'' object is at the heart of RapidSMS. It is the one carrying the SMS from the backend, to the router, then back to the backend for delivery to the user.

==== Properties ====

* ''message.text'': the actual text message. This can be a ''str'' or a ''unicode'' text. There is no size limitation.
* ''message.peer'': sender/recipient identity. Depending on backend, this is usually a string representing the phone number or equivalent.
* ''message.date'': a ''datetime'' object representing the reception date.
* ''message.status'': a string representing the status of the message. Not widely used.
* ''message.person'': a ''Person'' object which hold a reference to the connection
* ''message.connection'': a ''Connection'' object which holds reference to both the backend and the identity.

==== Methods ====

* ''message.send()'': sends the object to the appropriate backend.
* ''message.respond(text, status)'': creates a message to send back to the sender of this one. Actual sending is differed.
* ''message.flush_responses()'': sends all responses created with ''.respond()''
* ''message.forward(identity, text)'': creates a new message object on same backend with different identity then call ''respond()''.
== Models ==

Most RapidSMS Apps are used for Data Collection and rely on a Database.
Because RapidSMS is built on top of Django, you are encouraged to use Django's Models for this.

Since nothing here is specific to RapidSMS, please refer to Django Documentation&lt;ref&gt;http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.1/topics/db/models/#topics-db-models&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Example ===

==== Creating a model ====

A model resides in ''models.py'' file and should subclass ''django.db.models.Model'':

&lt;pre&gt;
from django.db import models

class SMS(models.Model):
    number = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    text = models.TextField()
&lt;/pre&gt;

This model contains 2 properties: number and text, both are strings.

Django's Models are an ORM (Object Relational Mapping). This means that from your apps, you will instantiate those objects like live objects and django will take care of storage/retrieval to/from the database.

'''Important''': Your model is just the representation of your data. You can consider it like the list of your tables fields. Each time you modify it, you will need to ask Django to update the actual database, which is separate.

==== Creating the database ====

As stated above, Django will be entirely responsible for Database access. Just make sure your ''local.ini'' is [[../Personal_Repository|correctly configured]] regarding the Database then re-sync the Database.

&lt;pre&gt;
./rapidsms syncdb
&lt;/pre&gt;

This command will create every newly added model.

Should you need to modify your model, you will have to erase and re-create the database:

&lt;pre&gt;
./rapidsms reset &lt;appname&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Dumping and restoring Data ====

Django includes a tool to backup and restore the content of your Database (models).

&lt;pre&gt;
./rapidsms dumpdata &lt;appname&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

This will display a serialized version of all your models data for the app ''appname''. You can also select one particular model.

&lt;pre&gt;
./rapidsms dumpdata &lt;appname&gt;.SMS &gt; backup.json
&lt;/pre&gt;

The previous command will save the content of the SMS model only and redirect it to a file. The default format for dumping and restoring datas in Django is JSON.

To restore a backup file, use the following

&lt;pre&gt;
./rapidsms loaddata backup.json
&lt;/pre&gt;


== Views ==

In Django-terminology, views are web pages.

Please, refer to [http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.1/topics/http/urls/#topics-http-urls|Django documentation] as none of the following is RapidSMS specific.

To display a web-page, the django way, you need to complete three steps:

=== Set the URL ===

The file ''urls.py'' keeps a record of all your app's URLs.
You need each of your views (pages) to be defined in ''urls.py'' in order to access them.

Example for an app named ''test'':

&lt;pre&gt;
from django.conf.urls.defaults import *

import test.views as views

urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^test/?$', views.index),
)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The above file will call the ''index'' view (nonexistent right now) for each HTTP request to ''http://&lt;server&gt;/test''.

=== Create a template ===

To save the developer some time and effort with dealing with HTML, Django offers the ability to use templates.
A template is an HTML file which can accept a particular syntax to display variables and other data from the view.

Create a sample RapidSMS template in the ''templates/'' folder:

&lt;pre&gt;
{% extends base_template %}

{% block content %}
&lt;p&gt;Hello {{ name }}!&lt;/p&gt;
{% endblock %}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This template extends the ''base_template'' one (which is RapidSMS's design) and replace the content of the block ''content'' with a paragraph.
This paragraph contain a template variable which we will have replaced by some text in the view.

=== Create an HTTP function ===

A view is just a function which return an ''HTTP'' object to be displayed on the visitor's browser.

A minimal ''views.py'' file:
&lt;pre&gt;
from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse(&quot;hello&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

With this view, displaying the corresponding web page on a browser will result in a blank page with the word hello.

Instead of writing HTML inside our view, we can call the template we just created.

On this, Django and RapidSMS differs a little. Here is the RapidSMS way:

&lt;pre&gt;
from rapidsms.webui.utils import render_to_response

def index(request):
    greeting = &quot;Thomas&quot;
    return render_to_response(request, 'templates/index.html', {'name': greeting})
&lt;/pre&gt;

This way, we are displaying a template and passing it a ''context'' (Hash) containing a list of our template-variables and their associated values.

Displaying it in a browser will result in a nice RapidSMS U.I with a sentence greeting Thomas.

== Django Admin ==

To access the Data corresponding to your models visually, you can enable the Django admin.
Django provide a web interface for administering some of its features but also the models created by developers.

It is accessible at ''http://&lt;server&gt;/admin''.

Refer to [[../Customizing_Admin_U.I|Customizing Admin U.I] to enable it for your App.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Documentation is important to every piece of code but even more for RapidSMS.

Because of the openness of RapidSMS and most of the Apps for it, it development focus and the community behind, there is a great need for reuse and improvements.

Proper documentation is a '''requirement''' to have you App reused and improved by the community.

== Coding standards ==

The RapidSMS community follows the [http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ PEP8] coding standard. It's a convention of how to write code which will ensure readability and easiness of contribution.

The standard is well written, please go read it. Some highlights though:

* Lines should not contain more than 79 characters
* No new line at end of file
* One space before and after operators
* 2 lines separation before classes or functions

Also, along the PEP8 standard, RapidSMS expects each file to contains formatting and encoding comments after shebang. Your files should thus always start with the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env python
# vim: ai ts=4 sts=4 et sw=4 coding=utf-8
&lt;/pre&gt;

Example of actual PEP8 compliant code:

&lt;pre&gt;

                            locale=self.locale)})
        return True
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Comments ==

Regular comments are very useful in RapidSMS Apps:

* helps beginners learn from example
* allows other developers to ''read'' your code in english instead of code
* will help yourself in the future when you'll have no idea why you wrote that line.
* helps you construct a consistent program by forcing you to concisely describe what you wrote ; thus enlightening mistakes.

Above example actually have some comments:

&lt;pre&gt;
def handle(self, message):

    # We only want to answer ping alone, or ping followed by a space
    # and other characters
    if not re.match(r'^ping( +|$)', message.text.lower()):
        return False

    identifier_match = re.match(r'^ping (?P&lt;identifier&gt;.+).*$', \
                                message.text.lower(), re.U)
    if not identifier_match:
        identifier = False
    else:
        identifier = identifier_match.group('identifier')

    # deny has higher priority
    if self.disallow:
        return False

    # allow or number in auth= or function returned True
    if self.allow or \
        (self.allowed and self.allowed.count(message.peer) &gt; 0) or \
        (self.func and self.func(message)):

        now = datetime.now()
        if identifier:
            message.respond(_(u&quot;%(pingID)s on %(date)s&quot;) % \
                            {'pingID': identifier, \
                            'date': format_datetime(now, \
                            locale=self.locale)})
        else:
            message.respond(_(u&quot;pong on %(date)s&quot;) % \
                            {'date': format_datetime(now, \
                            locale=self.locale)})
        return True
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Docstrings ==

Inline documentation is python feature that allows you to write some comments inside the code of your classes, functions and modules.
Python will then automatically parse those comments and formats them into a nice documentation.

Example:
&lt;pre&gt;
def handle(self, message):
    ''' check authorization and respond

    if auth contained deny string =&gt; return
    if auth contained allow string =&gt; answer
    if auth contained number and number is asking =&gt; reply
    if auth_func contained function and it returned True =&gt; reply
    else return'''

    # We only want to answer ping alone, or ping followed by a space
    # and other characters
    if not re.match(r'^ping( +|$)', message.text.lower()):
        return False
&lt;/pre&gt;

We added a multi-line comment (with triple-quotes) at the beginning of our method.
Python understands that every multi-line comment at the beginning of ''module'', ''class'', ''function'' or ''method'' is a docstring.

That docstring can be only one line long (although it still needs to use triple-quotes).

In the example above, we first added a short description (this is a convention), then some more detailed information after one line break.

To access the documentation, simply start a Python shell and call ''help()'' on the target object.

&lt;pre&gt;
./rapidsms shell
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;&gt; from apps.ping import app
&gt;&gt; help(app.App.handle)
Help on method handle in module apps.ping.app:

handle(self, message) unbound apps.ping.app.App method
    check authorization and respond
    
    if auth contained deny string =&gt; return
    if auth contained allow string =&gt; answer
    if auth contained number and number is asking =&gt; reply
    if auth_func contained function and it returned True =&gt; reply
    else return
&lt;/pre&gt;

This means that any developer can now access a well formatted documentation from the shell.

It is also used by external tools to generate standalone documentation in HTML or other.

'''Docstrings are required''' by the community in order for you app to be reused. Make sure you add docstrings to all your modules (files), classes, functions and methods.

Full example:
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env python
# vim: ai ts=4 sts=4 et sw=4 coding=utf-8
# maintainer: rgaudin

            return True
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Documentation ==

Even if your code is well written and correctly commented, no one wants to spend hours looking at source files just to check if the feature he's looking for exist.

That's why it is important that you create at least one file (nammed ''README'' at the root of your project by convention) describing your app.

It should contain:

* Name of App
* Your name and contact
* Description of what it does
* What dependencies it has
* How to install/use it.

Should your application be complex, please, also create a ''docs/'' folder and add any further documentation to it.

== Important Note ==

It is '''very important''' that you write those comments and docstring as you write the code because if you don't, it will result in errors in this documentation and '''bad documentation is worse than no documentation'''.
This is a habit you want to learn.

      <text xml:space="preserve">RapidSMS is an ''SMS framework'' based on ''Django'' (Python language). Yet, it is not simply a Django app.

== RapidSMS Components ==

=== Django ===

RapidSMS depends on Django. You need to install Django before installing RapidSMS.
This is the default Django (1.1) version.

=== RapidSMS (core) ===

What is called the ''core'' or ''master branch'' is the original source code from RapidSMS.
You can find it on github and it contains the following:
* ''apps/'': a collection of bundled apps (webapp, reporters, httptester)
* ''lib/'': RapidSMS libraries to handle SMS (Message, Connection, etc)
* ''lib/backends/'': Backends which is an abstraction level to the source of Messages (''http'' for tests, ''gsm'' for use with modems, ''kannel'' for operators)
* ''lib/router.py'': Library handling the routing of Messages from backends to apps and return.
* ''lib/parsers'': libraries to be used in Apps to help message parsing
* ''rapidsms'': a script which includes Django's ''manage.py'' functionality used to start rapidsms router.

=== Third parties apps ===

RapidSMS community produces a lot of apps which stays on creator's repositories.
A sample setup most of the time includes one or more app from a third party repository.

Those repositories can either be forks of the core (and thus includes libraries and everything) or just repositories of apps.

== Sample RapidSMS Installation ==

&lt;pre&gt;
~/sms
~/sms/apps
~/sms/apps/myapp

~/sources
~/sources/Django-1.1.1

~/sources/rapidsms
~/sources/pygsm
~/sources/third-party
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Avé''', ('''vierbe''' / ''verb'' / ''verbo''): 
*to have
*avere

== Usage Note ==
This verb is the most commonly used auxilliary (along with [[Molisan/verbs/èsse|èsse]]). It is not directly synonomous to the Italian verb ''avere'' in other cases. Rather, the verb [[Molisan/verbs/tené|tené]] is used. Avé is never used as a main verb, it only exists as a &quot;helping verb&quot;. It is often marked with a silent initial 'h' as in Italian. It is also an essential part of the verb [[Molisan/Verbs/Avé da|avé da]] (dovere, to need to).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Preface ==
This textbook was initiated as an output of the EARTHTIME Initiative (http://earth-time.org/), an international effort at improving geochronology.  This effort is driven by the geochronology community and this Wikibook is an outreach effort arising from this effort.
&lt;br /&gt;

Geochronology is a broad subject with a large number of sub-disciplines.  The initial version of this Wikibook attempts to cover the main stay of geochronology (U-Pb and 40Ar/39Ar) however it would be great if contributors could develop and expand the content to cover topics such as Quaternary Geochronology, Cosmochronology.  
&lt;br /&gt;

This wikibook was initiated as an output from a short course on 'Radio-isotopic dating and Mass Spectrometry' held as part of the GTSnext Marie Curie Initial Training Network (http://www.gtsnext.eu) held in Verbania, Italy, March 2010.&lt;br /&gt;

== Preface ==

'''Formal Definition:''' In mathematics, the trigonometric functions (also called circular functions) are functions of an angle. They are used to relate the angles of a triangle to the lengths of the sides of a triangle.

'''Translation:''' Understanding the various functions that can be applied to and taken from (graphs) the unit circle, and includes recognizing and using the various algebraic identities to manipulate trigonometric functions and equations.

== Graphing Functions ==

=== Sin ===
General formula:
* &lt;math&gt;y = a\sin(n(x-b)) + c&lt;/math&gt;

General Notes:

* General formula achieved isolating the coefficient of x (n), i.e. the &quot;lonely x rule&quot;.

* A period is equal to &lt;math&gt;[\frac{2\pi}{n}]&lt;/math&gt;

* The domain, unless restricted, is &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

* The range is equal to &lt;math&gt;[\pm a +c]&lt;/math&gt;, as the range of &lt;math&gt;y = \sin(x), y \in [-1,1]&lt;/math&gt;, see unit circle.

* The horizontal translation of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is reflected in the x-intercepts.

* Easily sketched by applying graphic transformations, from [[VCE Mathematical Methods]]
=== Cos ===

General formula:

* &lt;math&gt;y = a\cos(n(x-b)) + c&lt;/math&gt;

General Notes:

* General formula achieved isolating the coefficient of x (n), i.e. the &quot;lonely x rule&quot;.

* The domain, unless restricted, is &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, as &lt;math&gt;y = \cos(x), x \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

* A period is equal to &lt;math&gt;[\frac{2\pi}{n}]&lt;/math&gt;, as the factor of n

* The range is equal to &lt;math&gt;[\pm a +c]&lt;/math&gt;, as the range of &lt;math&gt;y = \cos(x), y \in [-1,1]&lt;/math&gt;, see unit circle.

* The horizontal translation of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is reflected in the x-intercepts.

* Easily sketched by applying graphic transformations, from [[VCE Mathematical Methods]]
=== Tan ===
General formula:
* &lt;math&gt;y = a\tan(n(x-b)) + c&lt;/math&gt;
General Notes:

* General formula achieved isolating the coefficient of x (n), i.e. the &quot;lonely x rule&quot;.

* A period is equal to &lt;math&gt;[\frac{\pi}{n}]&lt;/math&gt;

* The domain, &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \frac{k\pi}{2n}, k \in \mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt;, as &lt;math&gt; y = \tan(x), x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \frac{k\pi}{2}, k \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, indicating the asymptotes.

* The range, unless restricted, is &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, as the range of &lt;math&gt;y = \tan(x), y \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, see unit circle.

* The horizontal translation of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is reflected in the x-intercepts.

* Easily sketched by applying graphic transformations, from [[VCE Mathematical Methods]]

=== Arcsin ===
Also known as &lt;math&gt;Sin^-1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;sin^-&lt;/math&gt;

=== Arccos ===
Also known as &lt;math&gt;Cos^-1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;cos^-&lt;/math&gt;
=== Arctan ===
Also known as &lt;math&gt;Tan^-1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;tan^-&lt;/math&gt;

A jack plane e.g. Stanley #5

A small block plane e.g. Stanley #118 or Stanley #60½

A Japanese hand saw with flexible blade that cuts on the pull stroke.

An abundance of clamps is essential. Simple G-clamps are most useful.

: &lt;font size =3&gt;&lt;font color=red&gt;A word of caution: Many of the type numbers used here may be changed at a later date. The specialized ''United States Postage Meter Stamp Catalog'' is undergoing revision at this time, and an effort will be made to have the type numbers in both catalogs correspond. This is likely to require changes to some type numbers in this section. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

----
&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;font size=3&gt;The United States is the first country to use postage meter stamps on actual mail. In 1897 a small number of public access coin-operated postage franking machines were used experimentally for a few months in New York City.

:'''NOTES''': 1) For specialized information about the meter stamps of the United States, see the ''United States Postage Meter Stamp Catalog'', 2nd edition, 1994, and the ''2001 Update'' by Joel Hawkins and Richard Stambaugh, privately published, Goodyear, Arizona.

: 2) The small green entries (&lt;font color=green&gt;'''''&quot;USPMSC: xxx&quot;'''''&lt;/font&gt;) located above the Type number are the corresponding ''United States Postage Meter Stamp Catalog'' type numbers. If not present, the numbers are the same in both catalogs.

: 3) Most recently issued digital stamps (found in Groups M forward) include a 2-dimensional barcode in the design. In the United States three types have been used so far. They are the large rectangular &quot;PDF417&quot;, square &quot;Datamatrix&quot;, and small rectangular &quot;IBI Lite&quot; barcodes. The listings use these terms in the descriptions. The Datamatrix barcode can vary in size, and the PDF417 barcode can vary in both size and proportions.

[[File:US barcodes.jpg|center|800px]]


: An additional barcode found as a printable option with many digital stamps is the Facer Identification Mark or &quot;FIM&quot;.

[[File:USA FIM examples.jpg|center|350px]]



: 4) This catalog does not include self-service, public vending machine stamps that do not show a date and town name. These stamps are portable, i.e. they can be carried away and used at any future time and from any location and thus function as traditional adhesive stamps rather than meter stamps. These include “Postal Buddy” and the “Postal Mailing Center” stamps (ECA-Gard, Unisys). See the specialized catalog referenced in Note 1 for information about these issues.

==&lt;font color=blue&gt;GROUP E: Frameless design with large arcs at top and bottom and with groups of smaller arcs in each corner.==
&lt;font size=3&gt;&lt;li&gt; Without separate town mark. Printed on imperforate adhesive labels 54 mm x 46/48mm, never directly to covers. Meter numbers: 775, 1000 to 3676, 4200, 4234 and 8049. 
&lt;li&gt; All Group E stamps were produced by '''National Cash Register''' meter model '''P-1924(3-3)P-P''', a multi-value machine, first used in 1931.
&lt;li&gt; Stamps are printed in two stages, top and bottom in one stage and center line in another. 
&lt;li&gt; Most stamps have &quot;Z. Wt.&quot; (postal zone of destination, weight) at left center with a line above but occasionally without the line below or missing. Most stamps have a zero above &quot;Z. Wt.&quot; but occasionally you will find one with a single or double digit number or &quot;L&quot; (for Local zone) representing the zone or weight or both.
&lt;li&gt; Colors are usually the same in both stages but are often different. Some colors and color combinations are rare (red-violet, red-violet with red center, purple with blue center, purple with green center, and blue-green with red center).
&lt;li&gt; Several varieties of label paper were used with shades of brown and gray being very rare. Plain white is also rare.
&lt;li&gt; Examples without town names are used for registered mail.
&lt;li&gt; All these stamps are known with portions missing, probably from breakage. This includes the wavy lines in the corners and even the entire top or bottom portions.
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

: '''NOTE''': At least 41 self-service postage vending machines were trialed by two companies in 1991 and 1992, Pi Electronics (&quot;Zipster Plus&quot;) and ASM Services (&quot;Automatic Shipping Machine&quot;). The stamps are identical to Type LB1A and can be identified only by their meter numbers. Since the meters probably were re-distributed to other mailers after the conclusion of the vending trials, dates and town names are also necessary for accurate identification. Despite the large number of machines in the trials, verifiable examples are rare and worth possibly $50 and up. A list of meter numbers and town names can be found in the ''United States Postage Meter Stamp Catalog'', by Joel Hawkins and Richard Stambaugh.

&lt;font size=3&gt;
* All the stamps listed here are valid only on the date generated. PC stamps with unrestricted validity, i.e. they can be saved for future use, are more like traditional stamps than meter stamps and are not cataloged here. This eliminates Type SD1 from the original version of this catalog and excludes all photostamps.

* Group PC stamps can vary considerably in size, font styles, and color within the same stamp type depending on the users' printer settings, available fonts, etc. Size variations or colors other than black are unusual but should not be considered of great significance.

* The stamps are found on plain paper, adhesive labels of various sizes, and with or without fluorescent tagging. As with color and font, paper or label type is a user controlled variable and not of great significance.

* PC stamps are often found in a frame at the top right of large address labels. To the left of the stamp is a smaller frame containing a large letter or number representing the class of mail. Codes found are: '1' (first class), 'fcm' (first class), 'P' (priority), 'E' (express), 'M' (media), 'T' (parcel post), solid block (media, or other). Not all the codes are found with all the stamp types that use the labels.&lt;/font&gt;

:Thanks for the information. I have read the &quot;welcome page&quot; and I have studied the rules in more detail. 
Just really, I think that links were added by me, being useful for Wikibooks and for the readers. But I agree that I carried away by adding links too much.
In future I will discuss the necessity of the adding links on the module's talk page. Thanks.
:We have to be wary of some clever people trying to sneak in advertising to the lower-traffic Wikibooks when Wikipedia catches them at their game.  You should be able to add your link now.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:13, 2 April 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Creating a new CRF ==
=== Download the CRF Template ===
Log in to OpenClinica as a Study Director and click on &quot;Tasks&quot;. 
Select item &quot;CRFs&quot; in section &quot;Administration&quot; from the list.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:TaskMenuCRF.jpg|none|thumbs||Taskmenu]]
&lt;br&gt;
The next screen &quot;Administer Case Report Forms (CRFs)&quot; will appear. Click on &quot;Blank CRF Template&quot;.
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:AdministerCRFsBlank.jpg|none|thumbs||Blank CRF Template]]
&lt;br&gt;
By clicking this link the download of an excelsheet is started which can be used to define the elements of the CRF.
Save this file to your computer, open it with MSExcel and save it under a new name. 
&lt;br&gt;

=== OpenClinica-ID (OID) ===
In this section we will not elaborate on how you create sections, items or validations for your CRF. But at this point it may be useful to know how OpenClinica handles names.
Every object in OpenClinica has a unique OpenClinica-ID or OID. When you have edited the blank CRF template to start a CRF for let's say the intake of your study, rename your file to 'Intake.xls'. Type this name in cell A2 of tab CRF. The first four characters of the name of your file will be used to construct the OID. &lt;br&gt;
[[Image:CRFXLTabCRF.jpg|none|thumbs||XL sheet]]
&lt;br&gt;

=== Upload the new CRF ===
Make sure you've saved your excelsheet and switch back to OpenClinica. Now you will be able to upload your file (instructions below) and the CRF will be added to your list. The OID for intake.xls for example will be something like &quot;F_INTA_5348&quot; and is displayed in column &quot;VERSION_OID&quot;. The name you typed in cell A2 will appear in &quot;CRF Name&quot; which is the first column on the left.
Click on &quot;Create a new CRF&quot; in the &quot;Administer Case Report Forms (CRFs)&quot; screen. 
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:CreateNewCRF.jpg|none|thumbs||Create new CRF]]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The &quot;Create a New Case Report Form (CRF) screen will appear, click &quot;Browse&quot;, browse to your Excelsheet and select it.
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:UploadCRF.jpg|none|thumbs||Upload the new CRF]]
&lt;br&gt;
=== Check the CRF ===
Then click on &quot;Preview CRF Version&quot;. If errors were found they will be displayed in orange at the top of the result page. Open your excelfile, correct all errors and restart creating the new CRF. If no errors are found you can add your new CRF to your list of available CRFs.

Note that &quot;the exact same&quot; is not grammatically incorrect; the choice between it and &quot;exactly the same&quot; is stylistic, and personally I wouldn't call all such choices the same way.  I suggest you leave that one off your list while using pseudo-bot.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 05:26, 5 March 2011 (UTC)

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Dessert]]

'''Mousse au chocolat''' (French for &quot;chocolate foam&quot;) is a sweet food, normally served as dessert. This is an eggless and creamless interpretation of that classic which uses tofu to add body. Because of this, it is not nearly as fluffy as the original, but it will also store much longer and has fewer calories.

==Ingredients==

* 340 g (12 oz) [[Cookbook:semi-sweet chocolate|semi-sweet chocolate]], chips or coarsely chopped (see Note)
* 1 349 g (12.3 oz) Package Firm [[Cookbook:Silken tofu|Silken Tofu]] (see Note)

==Procedure==
# Melt the chocolate in a [[Cookbook:Double Boiler|double boiler]].
# Empty the tofu into the [[Cookbook: Blender|blender]] and pulse several times.
# Transfer all chocolate from double boiler to blender.
# Blend until smooth and thoroughly combined. Stop blender and scrape sides with spatula if necessary.
# Transfer to single dish or individual serving bowl. Chill in refrigerator for 6-8 hours or overnight. (See Note)

==Notes, tips and variations==

* It is an immensely easy recipe for untrained cooks.
* The chocolate used should not be too dark because the only sugar in this recipe comes from the chocolate itself, and the tofu will mute that sweetness. However, make sure that it is not too sweet as well because, in milk chocolates especially, once the sugar is muted there is not much flavor left.
* It is absolutely possible to substitute vegan chocolate into this recipe so that it becomes vegan-friendly.
* ''Firm'' silken tofu is not essential, but some sort of silken tofu absolutely is. It will come packaged in a simple cardboard rectangle, folded at the corners rather than the oversized plastic tub with a film covering it that you will find other tofu packaged in.
* This mousse can be consumed and will be tasty at any point, but it's not at it's best until it's set up.
* This recipe also makes a great filling for a graham cracker crust chocolate pie.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This script will let the user input data, the data are then declared as variables. They are then formed together making a person's perfect email address.
I have divided the code into sections. The full code is at the bottom of the page.

First, the welcoming:
&lt;pre&gt;
display dialog &quot;Welcome To Perfect Email&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
Next, we declare variables for the text returned
&lt;pre&gt;
set pet to text returned of (display dialog &quot;Enter Pet Name&quot; default answer &quot;i.e Bailey&quot; buttons {&quot;OK&quot;} default button 1)
set dono to text returned of (display dialog &quot;Enter Last Two Digits of your Birth Year&quot; default answer &quot;i.e 98 (*1998)&quot; buttons {&quot;OK&quot;} default button 1)
set prov to text returned of (display dialog &quot; Email Service Provider&quot; default answer &quot;i.e @yahoo.com , @aol.com&quot; buttons {&quot;OK&quot;} default button 1)
&lt;/pre&gt;
We set 3 varibles : pet, dono, and prov

prov = provider

dono = last two digits of birth year

pet = pet name

We set them to the text returned of a display dialog with text input.
Then we displayed all the variables (pet, dono, prov) together.
&lt;pre&gt;
display dialog pet &amp; dono &amp; prov
&lt;/pre&gt;

Result

There is no singular dish that represents all of Kenya. Different communities have their own native foods. Staples are maize and other cereals depending on the region including millet and sorghum eaten with various meats and vegetables. The foods that are universally eaten in Kenya are [[Cookbook:Ugali|ugali]], sukuma wiki, and nyama choma. Sukuma wiki, a Kiswahili phrase which literally means &quot;to push the week,&quot; is a simple dish made with greens similar to kale or collards that can also be made with cassava leaves, sweet potato leaves, or pumpkin leaves. Its Kiswahili name comes from the fact that it is typically eaten to &quot;get through the week&quot; or &quot;stretch the week.&quot; Nyama choma is roasted meat - usually goat or sheep- roasted over an open fire. It is best eaten with ugali and kachumbari. Among the Luhyas residing in the western region of Kenya, ingokho (chicken) and ugali is a favourite meal. Other than these, they also eat tsisaka, miroo, managu etc. Also among the Kikuyu of Central Kenya, a lot of tubers, ngwaci ([[Cookbook:Sweet Potato|sweet potatoes]]), ndũma (taro root) known in Kenya as arrowroot, ikwa (yams), mianga (cassava) are eaten as well as legumes like beans and a Kikuyu bean known as njahi.</text>

{{Pizzonese}}

==Noun gender==
There are two genders of Pizzonese nouns: ''masculine'' and ''feminine'', unlike in Neapolitan which also has a ''neuter'' case.  They take the following articles:

===Indefinite article (a)===

*''na'' in front of a singular feminine noun that begins with a consonant
*''nu'' in front of a singular masculine noun that begins with a consonant
*''n’'' in front of (any) singular noun that begins with a vowel

===Definite article (the)===
*If the word is feminine, the first letter must be doubled
*In the case of masculine nouns the doubling may occur also, in front of the consonants '''z-, b-, br-, v-,''' and '''g-'''.
*''le'' in front of a noun, masculine or feminine, singular or plural, that begins with a vowel

====Singular====
*''la'' in front of a feminine noun that begins with a consonant
*''glie'' in front of a masculine noun that begins with a consonant

====Plural====
*''le'' in front of (any) plural noun that begins with a consonant (feminine nouns double the consonant)

===Notes===
* Masculine nouns generally end in ''-e''
* Feminine nouns generally end in ''-a''
* As in Neapolitan, nouns beginning with ''a-'' tend to be feminine 
* †Nouns in the feminine plural feature initial consonant doubling like in Neapolitan

==Plurals==
A given noun's gender is not as clearly evident in Pizzonese as it is in Italian or even in Neapolitan.  '''Most''' masculine nouns end in ''-e'', '''most''' feminine nouns end in ''-e''.  Not all nouns change endings in the plural, ultimate vowel sounds do not change most of the time when forming plurals (unlike Italian), so they are useless in determination.  Feminine nouns tend to double the first consonant when they are plural.  The best way to determine the gender of a noun is by its article or by the endings on any modifiers it may have, for example: ''gle retratte'', masculine; ''la &lt;u&gt;b&lt;/u&gt;ettiglia'', feminine; ''le retriétte'' masculine plural; ''le &lt;u&gt;bb&lt;/u&gt;ettiglie'' feminine plural.  

The plural is sometimes formed by changing the body of the word itself (as in Neapolitan). This primarily happens in words already ending in ''-e'' and ''-a'' to begin with, for example ''gle vuaglióne'' becomes ''le vuagliune'' and ''la canzóna'' becomes ''le canzune''. With many nouns though, they stay the same in both the singular and the plural, as in ''lu/le quetiéglie'', both masc. singular and masc. plural.</text>

== Preface ==

This page serves to categorize and organize commonly used mathematical hacks, which allow their users to complete questions faster, and with a greater deal of accuracy.
== Units 3 and 4: Specialist Mathematics ==

=== Coordinate Geometry ===
==== Ellipses, Hyperbolas ====
The values &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; can be fractional, as can be seen by taking the following equation:

* &lt;math&gt;\frac{4(x)^2}{1} + \frac{16(y)^2}{1} = 1&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; a = \frac{1}{2}, b = \frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

Equations found in questions may not be in the general form, and may need to be transformed via the complete the square method::

==== Circles ====
Equations found in questions may not be in the general form, and may need to be transformed via the complete the square method, in conjunction with extricating all variables from under root symbols; an example follows:


=== Circular Functions ===

=== Complex Numbers ===

=== Relations and Regions in the Complex Plane ===

=== Differential Calculus ===

=== Integral Calculus ===

=== Differential Equations ===

=== Kinematics ===

=== Vectors ===

=== Vector Calculus ===

=== Mechanics ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Treating Tools After Use ==
In order to prolong the life of one's tools one must apply oil, wax, or some other treatment after every use.  This is especially important for metal tools because without it, they will rust.  Wooden tools (or tool handles etc.) will also benefit from regular attention in this way. 

The general method is to: 
Firstly ensure that the tool is completely free of rust and moisture; 
Secondly apply (via rag, brush, or some other means) the chosen product to the necessary surfaces of the tool.  

Later, before use, all traces (or, only build-up) should be removed with a clean rag and the tool sharpened as usual.

The questions of: what product to use; with what, where, and how often to apply it; how to remove it; and the benefits and pitfalls of the various methods will be dealt with below.  Keep in mind that, as with every woodworking topic, there are a great number of different, and often contradictory, methods; the one you settle on should suit ''your'' tools, timber, environment, and budget.

XSLTForms use a combination of XSLT transformation, JavaScript and CSS to convert XForms specifications into browser specific structures.  Unlike other XForms technologies, XSLTForms can be transformed on either the client or the server.

== '''MLA Style Short Quotations''' ==

*When you are directly quoting the work of another person in your paper you will need to format the quotations differently depending on the length of the quote. Also remember that MLA style should be double spaced.

Here are some guidelines to follow when inserting a short quotation:

*1) A short quote is fewer than four typed lines in your text.
*2) Make sure to include the author and the specific page citation and also make sure that the author is on the works cited page.
*3) Make sure that punctuation marks like periods, commas, and semicolons are after the parenthetical citation.
*4) Punctuation marks like question marks and exclamation points should appear inside the quotation marks as long as it is a part of the passage.

Here are some examples from Purdue Owl online writing lab
 According to some, dreams express &quot;profound aspects of personality&quot; (Foulkes 184), though others disagree.
 
 
 According to Foulkes's study, dreams may express &quot;profound aspects of personality&quot; (184).
 
 
 Is it possible that dreams may express &quot;profound aspects of personality&quot; (Foulkes 184)?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Revelation: Verse by Verse Commentary ==

The Christian ''Bible'' is divided into two major sections: the ''Old Testament'', which predates Christianity and consists of the Jewish scriptures, and the ''New Testament'', written early in the Christian era. ''Revelation'' is the last document (&quot;book&quot;) of the ''New Testament'', and therefore of the ''Bible'' as a whole. The ''Revelation Commentary'' consists of the text of ''Revelation'' divided into short passages, with each passage being accompanied by historical and/or interpretive notes. There are various interpretations of Revelation, and this is reflected in the commentary, with different, even contradictory, interpretations appearing side by side. The reader is thus able to compare the text with differing interpretations and draw his or her own conclusions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:PDEBook0013.png|frame|The neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;(x_0, y_0, z_0)&lt;/math&gt;.]]

The neighborhood of some point is defined as the open set that lies within some Euclidean distance δ from the point. Referring to the picture at right (a 3D example), the neighborhood of the point &lt;math&gt;(x_0, y_0, z_0)&lt;/math&gt; is the shaded region which satisfies:


:&lt;math&gt;(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2 + (z - z_0)^2 &lt; \delta^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

The Laplacian being zero implies a test point is the average of its neighbours, but not vice-versa. Any function with well behaved
Taylor expansion will exhibit linear behaviour in the closest neighbourhood of a test point. In the Taylor's expansion, the
linear term will dominate, as the step size h approaches zero: all higher order terms in h vanish, and the test point becomes
an average of its neighbours, as they are all linearly related.

To achieve a potent view, the notion of a point being close to the average of its neighbours needs to be augmented with the
condition that dividing the 2nd difference by h squared leads to zero as h goes to zero.

Example: The potential around a charged sphere in an otherwise empty universe:

This is v ~= r to the minus one, the solution of Poisson's equation.
All functions of the form r to the minus any integer k, will satisfy
&quot;the function is the average of its close surrounding neighbours&quot;
but only k = -1 satisfies Poisson's equation.</text>

==Lua==

*Functional
*Object-orientated



There are other aspects of Lua programming than functions, but functions are easy to understand, an example...

&lt;source lang=&quot;lua&quot;&gt;
  -- comments here
  function my_function(par1,par2)
      ...
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

As you see, it's easy to declare a function, you might use this function elsewhere by calling:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lua&quot;&gt;
  my_function(&quot;hello&quot;,&quot;world&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
Within a function, you can declare local values. Local values have a scope which is limited to the function where they are declared. Any function may return a value, here's an example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lua&quot;&gt;
  function calculate(a,b)
      local temp
      temp=a+b
      return temp
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

As you may have guessed, this function performs an addition, you can call:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lua&quot;&gt;
  c=calculate(1,2) 
&lt;/source&gt;

and the value of &quot;c&quot; will be 3.


Lua has some common controls like &quot;if...then&quot; or &quot;while...do&quot;. Here is a short example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lua&quot;&gt;
  if val==0 then
      result=&quot;zero&quot;
  elseif val  &lt;  0 then
      result=&quot;negative&quot;
  else
      result=&quot;positive&quot;
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

And another one:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lua&quot;&gt;
  while i&gt;0 do
      result=result*2
      i=i-1
  end
&lt;/source&gt;


To compare numeric values, you can use the operators:

 == (equals)
 ~= (different)
 &gt;(greater)
 &lt;(lower)
 &gt;= (greater or equal)
 &lt;= (lower or equal)

==AmiLua==

AmiLua extends Lua with some functions for handling intuition windows, gadgets, menus and graphics functions.

There are 3 Lua tables:
* Siamiga: Windows, creating of gadgets and menues, message handling, drawing functions
* Sigadget: setting and getting of gadget parameters
* Sipicture: loading, grabbing and blitting of bitmaps.

.alua is the specific &quot;dialect&quot; of lua that includes zulu and siamiga. If you are going to write some zulu or siamiga stuff you need to use the .alua extension and to point to amilua.




===Siamiga===

&lt;source lang=&quot;lua&quot;&gt;
Siamiga.createwindow(title,  left,   top,  [width], [height], [sizeable], [smartrefresh])
Siamiga.openwindow(window)
Siamiga.querywindow(window)
Siamiga.closewindow(window)
Siamiga.pset(window, x,y)
Siamiga.line(window, x1, y1 , [x2] , [y2])
Siamiga.box(window, [left], [top], [width], [height], filled)
Siamiga.ellipse(window, x, y, rx, ry)
Siamiga.text(window, x, y, txt)
Siamiga.querytext(window, text)
Siamiga.createpen(red, green, blue)
Siamiga.releasepen(number)
Siamiga.setpen(window, number)
Siamiga.waitmessage(win1, [...])
Siamiga.getmessage(window)
Siamiga.filebox([title], [default dir])
Siamiga.messagebox(window, title, text, buttons)
Siamiga.queryscreen()
Siamiga.addmenu(window, code, type, label, [key])
Siamiga.addgadget(window, code, type, left, top, width, height, label, [default], [min], [max])
Siamiga.__gc
&lt;/source&gt;




===Sigadget===
&lt;source lang=&quot;lua&quot;&gt;
Sigadget.set(gadget, value)
Sigadget.get(gadget)
&lt;/source&gt;




===Sipicture===

&lt;source lang=&quot;lua&quot;&gt;
Sipicture.load(filename)
Sipicture.put(picture, window, left, top, [width], [height])
Sipicture.get(window, left, top, width, height)
Sipicture.query(picture)
Sipicture.free(picture)
Sipicture.__gc
&lt;/source&gt;

A complex drawing utility, should be written it in C, as you will soon reach the limits of what LUA offers.






===Zulu===

Zulu allows you to create MUI applications from Lua scripts.

You'll find it in the current nightly build in the directory &quot;Extras/Development/Lua&quot;. You need an assign named &quot;lua&quot; to this directory. The binary Amilua is build with the MUI binding. Some examples are in the subdir &quot;test-mui.Documentation is in &quot;doc/zulu.txt&quot;. If you haven't programmed MUI before you should download mui38dev from Aminet and study the documentation.

Groups are MUI/Zune classes, too. Of course, you have to look in the documentation what attributes are possible. The Group class is a subclass of the Area class, this makes it possible to use its attributes like MUIA_Disabled.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lua&quot;&gt;
object = mui.new(class, tag1, value1, tag2, value2 , ...)
object = mui.make(class, param1, param2 , ... )

mui.set(object, tag1, value1, ...)
intval = mui.getint(object, tag)
strval = mui.getstr(object, tag)
ptrval = mui.getptr(object, tag)
boolval = mui.getbool(object, tag)

intval = mui.doint(object, method, ...)
strval = mui.dostr(object, method, ...)
ptrval = mui.doptr(object, method, ...)
boolval = mui.dobool(object, method, ...)
mui.dispose(object)

id, signals = mui.input(app)
mui.wait(signals)
retval = mui.request(app, win, flags, title, gadgets, text)
id = mui.makeid(4 digit string)
path = mui.filerequest(tag1, value1, ...)
bool = mui.check(object)

object = strarray.new( string1, string2 , ...)
strarray.dispose(object)
str = strarray.get(object, index)

require &quot;muidefs&quot; - * MUIC are class descriptors to use as first parameter for mui.new
                    * MUIO are class descriptors to use as first parameter for mui.make
                    * MUIM are methods for mui.doint, mui.dostr, mui.dobool and mui.doptr
                    * MUIA are attributes
                    * MUIV are values

require &quot;muifuncs&quot;

require &quot;muiasl&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;





===ASL requesters===

To get multiple files from an ASL requester through Zulu function mui.filerequest(), you have to call the function within curly brackets in order to get multiple results 

 files = { mui.filerequest(.....) }

 mui.ASLFR_DoMultiSelect, true
 
Below there's a snipped of my Lua code (based on Mazze's example)

&lt;source lang=&quot;lua&quot;&gt;
file = { mui.filerequest( 
             mui.ASLFR_TitleText,           &quot;Select one or more files to compress&quot;, 
             mui.ASLFR_InitialHeight,      400, 
             mui.ASLFR_InitialWidth,       320, 
             mui.ASLFR_InitialLeftEdge,  40, 
             mui.ASLFR_InitialTopEdge,  20, 
             mui.ASLFR_DoMultiSelect,   true,         
             mui.ASLFR_PositiveText,     &quot;OK&quot;, 
             mui.ASLFR_RejectIcons,      true, 
             mui.ASLFR_NegativeText,   &quot;CANCEL&quot;, 
             mui.ASLFR_InitialFile,          &quot;asl.library&quot;, 
             mui.ASLFR_InitialDrawer,    &quot;libs:&quot; 
             ) 
        }
        print(&quot;Selected File(s)&quot;) 
        print(file)
&lt;/source&gt;


Lua supports currently only static libraries. zulu and siamiga a static libraries. So you have to create a static library and then re-link AmiLua with that library. IIRC there is needed a header file for the connection between Lua and the library. 





==Libraries==


'''LUA.Filesystem''' (not implemented yet) 

&lt;source lang=&quot;lua&quot;&gt;
lfs.attributes (filepath [, aname])  e.g. dev, ino, nlink, uid, gid, rdev, access, modification, change, size,   blocks, blksize
lfs.chdir (path)
lfs.lock_dir(path, [seconds_stale])
lfs.currentdir ()
iter, dir_obj = lfs.dir (path)
lfs.lock (filehandle, mode[, start[, length]])
lfs.mkdir (dirname)
lfs.rmdir (dirname)
lfs.setmode (file, mode)
lfs.symlinkattributes (filepath [, aname])
lfs.touch (filepath [, atime [, mtime]])
lfs.unlock (filehandle[, start[, length]])
&lt;/source&gt;


'''LUA.Socket'''

&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;



'''lua.sqlite3'''

&lt;pre&gt;
db = sqlite3.open(&quot;filename&quot;)

db = sqlite3.open_memory()

db:close()

db:exec

db:irows
db:rows
db:cols
db:first_irows
db:first_rows
db:first_cols

db:prepare
db:set_function
&lt;/pre&gt;

LuaSQL frontend [http://www.keplerproject.org/luasql/manual.html docs]. 





Lua use of first-class functions allow the employment of many powerful techniques from functional programming; 

and full lexical scoping allows fine-grained information hiding to enforce the principle of least privilege.


[http://www.lua.org/about.html Lua] allows programmers to implement namespaces, classes, and other related features using its single table implementation; 

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language) Lua] does not contain explicit support for inheritance, but allows it to be implemented relatively easily with [http://lua-users.org/wiki/ObjectOrientedProgramming metatables]. 






==Examples==

[http://lua-users.org/wiki/SampleCode Sample Code]



Shell variables are files which are stored in ENV:.

So you can either use output redirection:

 lua:lua checkspace.lua &gt;env:myvariable

Or you can use the file handling functions of Lua to write to ENV:myvariable.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lua&quot;&gt;
lua:lua checkspace.lua dh0
IF $myvariable GT 18000000 VAL
...
ENDIF
&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;source lang=&quot;lua&quot;&gt;
require &quot;muidefs&quot;
require &quot;muifuncs&quot;

function creategui()
  local button = mui.SimpleButton(&quot;_Ok&quot;)
  local text = mui.TextObject(mui.MUIA_Text_Contents, &quot;27cHello world! How are you?&quot;)
  local window = mui.WindowObject(
    mui.MUIA_Window_Title, &quot;Hello world!&quot;,
    mui.MUIA_Window_RootObject, mui.ScrollgroupObject(
      mui.MUIA_Scrollgroup_Contents, mui.VirtgroupObject(
        mui.Child, text,
        mui.Child, button
      )
    )
  )
  app = mui.ApplicationObject(
    mui.MUIA_Application_Window, window
  )
  assert(app:check(), &quot;Cant create application&quot;)
  window:doint(mui.MUIM_Notify, mui.MUIA_Window_CloseRequest, true,
    app, 2, mui.MUIM_Application_ReturnID, mui.MUIV_Application_ReturnID_Quit)
  button:doint(mui.MUIM_Notify, mui.MUIA_Pressed, false,
    app, 2, mui.MUIM_Application_ReturnID, mui.MUIV_Application_ReturnID_Quit)
  window:set(mui.MUIA_Window_Open, true)
end

function main()
  creategui()
  app:doint(mui.MUIM_Application_Execute)
end

_, err = pcall(main)
if err then print(&quot;Error: &quot; .. err) end
if app then app:dispose() end
&lt;/source&gt;


This example lets you enable/disable the group with the two text fields.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lua&quot;&gt;
require &quot;muidefs&quot;
require &quot;muifuncs&quot;

ok_id = 1
cancel_id = 2

function creategui()
  local okbutton = mui.SimpleButton(&quot;_Enable&quot;)
  local cancelbutton = mui.SimpleButton(&quot;_Disable&quot;)
  local text1 = mui.TextObject(mui.MUIA_Text_Contents, &quot;27cHello world!&quot;)
  local text2 = mui.TextObject(mui.MUIA_Text_Contents, &quot;27cHow are you?&quot;)

  group = mui.VGroup(
      mui.Child, text1,
      mui.Child, text2
  )

  window = mui.WindowObject(
    mui.MUIA_Window_Title, &quot;Hello world!&quot;,
    mui.MUIA_Window_RootObject, mui.VGroup(
      mui.Child, group,
      mui.Child, mui.HGroup(
        mui.Child, okbutton,
        mui.Child, cancelbutton
      )
    )
  )
  app = mui.ApplicationObject(
    mui.MUIA_Application_Window, window
  )
  assert(app:check(), &quot;Cant create application&quot;)
  window:doint(mui.MUIM_Notify, mui.MUIA_Window_CloseRequest, true,
    app, 2, mui.MUIM_Application_ReturnID, mui.MUIV_Application_ReturnID_Quit)

  okbutton:doint(mui.MUIM_Notify, mui.MUIA_Pressed, false, app, 2, mui.MUIM_Application_ReturnID, ok_id)
  cancelbutton:doint(mui.MUIM_Notify, mui.MUIA_Pressed, false, app, 2, mui.MUIM_Application_ReturnID, cancel_id)

  window:set(mui.MUIA_Window_Open, true)
end


function main()
  creategui()
  running = true
  while running do
    id, signals = app:input()
    if id == mui.MUIV_Application_ReturnID_Quit then
      running = false
    elseif id == ok_id then
      group:set(mui.MUIA_Disabled, false)
    elseif id == cancel_id then
      group:set(mui.MUIA_Disabled, true)
    end
    if running then mui.wait(signals) end
  end
end


_, err = pcall(main)
if err then print(&quot;Error: &quot; .. err) end
if app then app:dispose() end
&lt;/source&gt;

How to declare variable located in external file? I need config text file with some variables. How to declare them in main file? 

&lt;pre&gt;
example:

config.cfg:

v = 5

main.lua:

a = 5
v = ?????????

a = a + v
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.lua.org/pil/8.html loadfile()] is what you need. 






==Issues==

Floattext.mui class &amp; Lua Is it possible use this class in Zulu? How to use it to read and show text in window? 
Could not get it working nicely for WHD_Menu. Ended up using a list object. You can download [http://archives.aros-exec.org/index.php?function=browse&amp;cat=game/utility WHD_Menu] from Aros Archive to have a look on how it was achieved. This object is used to display the readme file (variable is CurrentReadMe). 

Is it possible to use in this class a function to search requested word in readme file to get line number as result? Each line is an entry in the list. Just parse all entries and search for the string in the field. You'll get directly the line number this way. 

This [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?start=0&amp;topic_id=5589&amp;viewmode=flat&amp;order=ASC thread] multiple file selection isn't working out of the box, you have to create your own class and this is not possible with Lua/Zulu, you have to do it in C. 

If you download to other location having space in name still will be problem. How to fix it? 
Ensure that the path is enclosed in double quotes. From the [http://archives.aros-exec.org/index.php?function=browse&amp;cat=network/misc AROS Exec Download Tool]: 

 local retval = os.execute('c:run sys:utilities/multiview &quot;' .. readme_target .. '&quot;')

Here I have the double quotes only for readme_target because the path to MultiView doesn't have spaces. 

changed line to: 

 local dir_opt = &quot;\&quot;&quot; .. dir_str:getstr(mui.MUIA_String_Contents) .. &quot;\&quot;&quot;

Examples [http://archives.aros-exec.org/index.php?function=browse&amp;cat=utility/archive here] and [http://archives.aros-exec.org/index.php?function=browse&amp;cat=network/ftp here]. 


How to internationalize Lua script?
There is no interface to locale.library in Lua. Just create tables with strings. 

&lt;pre&gt;
strings = {}
strings[&quot;deutsch&quot;] = {&quot;Anwendung&quot;, &quot;Fenster&quot;}
strings[&quot;english&quot;] = {&quot;Application&quot;, &quot;Window&quot;}

language = &quot;english&quot;

print(strings[language][1])
&lt;/pre&gt;

So I need to add &quot;choose language&quot; gadget or is there any function to check locale used in system?
Could I use external files deutsch.lang, polski.lang etc. or these strings must be in main file? Which way is easier and which is better for these small Lua scripts? 

There is an environment variable named &quot;language&quot; and Lua has a function to query environment variables: 

&lt;pre&gt;
language = os.getenv (&quot;language&quot;)
if language = NIL
language = &quot;english&quot;
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

In MUI/ZUNE to read a string value from a ListObject the following code applies. 

&lt;pre&gt;
STRPTR *stringValue = NULL;
DoMethod(list, MUIM_List_GetEntry, active, &amp;stringValue);
&lt;/pre&gt;

Bear in mind that MUIM_List_GetEntry returns a pointer to a generic entry. A string pointer is only a special case for single column lists.

How does ZULU handle this in Lua, as according to zulu.txt none of the accessor methods (getstr, dostr, etc) appear to match this patten of passing a string pointer as an argument?
I'm using local current = listobject:getint(mui.MUIA_List_Active) to query the index of the selected entry. So you could assign a StrArray to mui.MUIA_List_SourceArray then use the mui.MUIA_List_Active result as the index for that array.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Prologue==

===Verses 1-2===
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; '''''The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him to show to his servants things which must shortly come to pass. And he sent and signified it by his angel to his servant John,''''' &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''''' who bore record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.'''''

''Commentary:'' The opening indicates the order of the message's transmission: a) from God, b) to Jesus, c) to an angel, d) to John, e) to the servants of God. While John received the actual visions, however, we only have his descriptions of them. One senses that words are inadequate to describe what he actually saw. John is delivering this message to the servants of God. Note well the plurality of the word, servant. It was not God's intention for John to be the only one to obtain the revelation and keep it to himself. God desired that the people in the church, his &quot;servants&quot; would gain understanding. Those in today's churches also  have a biblical right to understand the message being delivered in this book.  The verse goes on to say that the things contained within the prophecy will happen &quot;shortly.&quot; This has variously been understood as from the perspective of the audience (anything from minutes to years), in historical terms (hundreds or thousands of years), or from the point of view of an eternal Deity (for whom 10,000 years would be nothing).  

The author identifies himself as John which many people have suggested is actually the John if the Gospel of John.  However, scholars have shown this to be unlikely. The Gospel of John and Revelation have two very different writing styles.  The authors use often use different words to express the same concept.  An example is the word used for lamb.  In Revelation the word ''arnion,''whereas in the author of John uses another word for lamb.  The two books also use the same word to mean different things.  Examples include ''ethnos/ethne'' which refers to Gentiles or all nations in Revelation, but in The Gospel of John the same word is used to refer to the Jews.  Similarly, ''Kosmos'' in Revelation is used to refer to the created world and in John it is used to refer to the world of humanity.  Additional evidence that the John of Revelation is not the John of the Gospel of John is that they often spell the same word differently, Jerusalem being a prime example of this.  In Revelation Jerusalem is spelled ''Ierosalem'' and in John it is spelled ''Ierosoluma.''  While there is no conclusive proof of who the John of Revelation was, it is the scholarly consensus that he was not the John of the Gospel of John.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Witherington III, Revelation, Cambridge University Press: New York, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verse 3===
:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''''' Blessed is he that reads, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein, for the time is at hand.'''''

''Commentary:'' The blessing of Verse 3 carries a threefold condition: Read, understand (hear), and obey (keep those things). God gave prophecies to be obeyed, not simply to be discussed and debated. &quot;The time is at hand&quot; simply means that no further things must occur before the fulfillment of the prophecies. It does not mean the time was (or is) imminent.

The mention of reading and hearing may also be an indication that the document was intended to be read to the congregations to whom it was addressed. Early churches would read the entire book of revelation every time they met, from beginning to end, this could be because this is the only book out of the entire Bible that states a blessing will be given to those who read it, listen to it, and obey it. We are to act in one's faith about what we hear during Revelation.

===Verse 4-5a===
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; '''''John, to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be to you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come, and from the seven spirits which are before his throne,''''' &lt;sup&gt;5a&lt;/sup&gt; '''''and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth.''''' 

''Commentary:'' &quot;Asia&quot; was a Roman province in what is now western Turkey. This verse is evidence for the author being the Apostle John. John became the leader of the church at Ephesus after the death of Paul and the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in A.D. 70. The other churches to whom letters were given were daughter churches established by the church at Ephesus. John would therefore have exercised pastoral influence over them, and it then makes sense that his letters were addressed to them. It also explains the absence of letters to other major churches, as John did not have leadership of them. The benediction refers to the Godhead, which is eternal in existence. The phrase &quot;is, was, is to come&quot; comes from the translation of the Hebrew Yahweh, which means &quot;I am&quot;. The seven Spirits are somewhat cryptic. The number 7, in the Bible, means spirituallt complete. They probably represent the spirits of the seven churches embodied within the Holy Spirit. (Verse 5a): Jesus Christ is identified as the faithful witness who revealed the plan of God, the first to be resurrected from the dead, and the future worldwide ruler of the Millennial Kingdom. (Note &quot;prince&quot; of kings rather than &quot;king&quot; of kings).

Witherington says, &quot;A major point of this entire book is that heaven and earth are very close indeed; in fact they are juxtaposed in such a way that heaven is already active in and for earth and will descend to it at the end in the from of the New Jerusalem.&quot; He asserts that it is very unlikely that John would have divided the holy spirit up seven different ways. Rather, he draws on early Jewish texts that refer to seven archangels before the throne of God (Tob. 12:15, 1 En.20.1-8, and 4 Qserek) that are the eyes of the great King keeping watch over the church of the lamp. This image is to ensure that Christ is not distant but very near among the lampstands (or seven congregations). (Witherington 2003)

===Verse 5b-6===
:&lt;sup&gt;5b&lt;/sup&gt; '''''To him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,''''' &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; '''''and has made us kings and priests unto God and his Father, to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.'''''

''Commentary:'' These verses are praise to Jesus Christ, whose sacrifice on the cross gave us redemption from our sins, and (Verse 6) made us acceptable to enter the Holy Presence of the Godhead. John gives Jesus eternal praise, glory, and authority. Amen in this context means &quot;Let it be so&quot;.





===Verse 7===
:&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; '''''Behold, He comes with clouds, and every eye shall see Him, and they also which pierced Him, and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of Him. Even so, Amen.'''''

''Commentary:'' Christ will come with the clouds (Daniel 7:13) in the sky. This may refer to the final return to establish His Millennial Kingdom, not to the Rapture. Everyone will see Him (Matthew 24:30). Those who pierced Him may be those who have rejected Him as their Savior. Everyone who is without His grace will be, according to one interpretation, sorry and fearful (wail). &quot;Even so, Amen&quot; in this context could be rendered &quot;Let it be done, whether people are ready or not&quot;. 

&quot;πᾶσαι αἱ φυλαὶ&quot; is alternatively translated as &quot;all the tribes of the earth,&quot; &quot;all kindreds of the earth,&quot; or &quot;all the peoples of the world.&quot; These words occur only once elsewhere in the New Testament, in Matthew 24:30 as Jesus describes his second coming. Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772) imagined that the despair of all the tribes on earth showed that &quot;truth and good will be no more&quot; either within or without the Christian church. Adam Clarke (1762-1832) on the other hand supposed that πᾶσαι αἱ φυλαὶ referred to Jews and Romans, not Christians.




===Verse 8===
:&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; '''''“&lt;font color=red&gt;I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending,&lt;/font&gt;” says the Lord, “&lt;font color=red&gt;which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty&lt;/font&gt;.”'''''

''Commentary:'' John clearly demonstrates his high Christology by placing the divine name on the lips of Jesus.  By claiming to be the Alpha and the Omega (or in more contemporary terms, the A and the Z), Jesus unites himself with God.  This is seen both by the fact that within Revelation, Jesus and God are referred to equally by these titles and by the allusion to Isaiah 44:6 (“I am the first and last, and besides me there is no God”), with which John was surely familiar.  From the onset, Christ is unified with God, which gives Christ the authority to proclaim the rest of the vision – the Omega half of history.  &lt;ref&gt;Witherington, Ben.  Revelation.  Cambridge Univeristy Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==John's Vision of Christ==

===Verse 9===
:&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; '''''I, John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.'''''

''Commentary:'' John's exile to Patmos, together with the phrase, &quot;your brother and companion in tribulation,&quot; implies a time of persecution. This is further indicated by the mention of a martyrdom in Pergamos&lt;sup&gt;[2:13]&lt;/sup&gt; and other passages in the messages to the churches&lt;sup&gt;.[cf. 2:3; 2:9-10]&lt;/sup&gt; John was exiled to Patmos because of his preaching and his testimony of Jesus Christ, having irritated the Roman government by doing so. Tribulation here refers to the present sufferings of believers, not the end times. Believers live in the present (Church Age) form of God's Kingdom, waiting and enduring until His return.

===Verse 10-11===
:&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; '''''I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,''''' &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; '''''saying, “&lt;font color=red&gt;I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last,&lt;/font&gt;” and, “&lt;font color=red&gt;What you see, write in a book, and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea&lt;/font&gt;.”'''''

''Commentary:'' &quot;In the spirit&quot; means John was in a state of receiving prophetic revelation from God. &quot;The Lord's Day&quot; refers to Sunday as the new Sabbath day for Christians, and the only other place this term (kuriakos) is used is in I Corinthians 11:20. Again, Alpha and Omega, the first and the last are applied to Jesus Christ. The seven churches introduced here are expanded upon in Chapters 2 and 3.

The seven churches were in the Roman province of &quot;Asia,&quot; an area which is in western Turkey today. Why these seven churches were chosen to be the recipients of the Revelation, we can only guess. Yet it is clear that what Jesus says to them is meant ultimately for the Church in all times and places, for after each church’s message, seven times in all, Jesus says, “He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches” (2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22).

===Verse 12===
:&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; '''''And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks.'''''

''Commentary:'' The seven candlesticks are said in Verse 20 to represent the seven churches. The number seven plays a prominent role in Revelation. Many scholars believe that the number seven, when given symbolic interpretation, represents completeness and perfection.

At this point the Jewish menorah (containing seven candles) was a common symbol of Judaism. In the vision John is seeing the seven lights are separated. Perhaps symbolizing a full representation of God's people in each church. (Witherington 2003).

===Verse 13-15===
:&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; '''''And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of Man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girded about the chest with a golden girdle.''''' &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; '''''His head and His hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and His eyes were as a flame of fire,''''' &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; '''''And His feet like to fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace, and His voice as the sound of many waters.'''''

''Commentary:'' &quot;Like unto the Son of Man&quot; means the figure looked to John like Jesus Christ glorified. Son of Man is a messianic title that Jesus Himself frequently used. The garments depicted here are the robes of a judge. Christ has judgmental authority over all creation. The white hair signifies justice, purity, and glory. Fire is often associated with judgment in the Scriptures( rf. Matthew 5:22, 2 Peter 3:7). The brass and the voice symbolize power and authority.Brass is a metal that has a Biblical connection with sacrifice (e.g. the brazen altar of sacrifice in Israel: Exodus 27:1-6). Jesus was the ultimate sacrifice on the cross for the sins of the world. Brass is also known to be a very strong metal. Therefore to compare Christ's feet to that of fine brass demonstrates His power, permanence, and stability. The seven candlesticks again represent the churches, and Christ's position in the midst of them shows He is the root and leader of the churches.

===Verse 16===
:&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; '''''And He had in His right hand seven stars, and out of His mouth went a sharp two-edged sword, and His countenance was as the sun shines in his strength.'''''

''Commentary:'' The seven stars are identified in Verse 20 as the angels of the seven churches. The sharp sword is a metaphor for the Word of God, the power of which is sharp and certain. His face shone as the sun, so that John has difficulty looking at it. Compare this to Exodus 33 and 34, in which Moses experiences much the same thing when he asks to see God. Moses returns from the mountain with his own face glowing, much to the amazement of the people.





===Verse 17===
:&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; '''''And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead. And He laid his right hand upon me, saying to me, “&lt;font color=red&gt;Fear not. I am the first and the last&lt;/font&gt;.&quot;''''' 

''Commentary:'' At the first sight of Jesus, John’s unworthiness to the almighty one causes John to fall to his feet.  This happens three times in the book of Daniel (8:17-18, 10:9-10, 10:15).  John's initial reaction is fear. As He did many times with the apostles, Jesus tells John not to fear. This command to not fear is present in the Bible 365 times, give or take.  Jesus again states His identity to reassure John that nothing can happen without His approval.  The mentioning of Christ being the first and the last (Alpha and Omega) that is mentioned many times in the prophecy of Isaiah (41:4, 44:6, 48:12) and Repeated again in Revelation 2:8 as well as 22:13.  This mentioning of the first and the last shows that God encompasses all things from beginning to end and all things in-between.  God is the beginning and end of time, and the first and the last of all creation.  This verse shows that God is transcendent of all things, and all time (Hebrews 13:8) and shows his sovereignty as well as his divinity.

===Verse 18===
:&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&quot;&lt;font color=red&gt;I am He that lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive for evermore. Amen. And I have the keys of hell and of death&lt;/font&gt;.&quot;'''''

''Commentary:'' Christ continues His affirmation, leaving absolutely no doubt that He is God. He was dead at the crucifixion, He rose from the dead, and He is alive forevermore. Amen used here means &quot;I tell you it is so&quot;. The keys of hell and of death symbolize His authority to judge the living and the dead of all ages. At His command, death and hell will give up their captives.





===Verse 19===
:&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&quot;&lt;font color=red&gt;Write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter&lt;/font&gt;.&quot;'''''

''Commentary:'' Verse 19 is the key to the layout of Revelation. The book has three main divisions: 
::&quot;the things which you have seen&quot;: John's vision of Christ (ch 1);
::&quot;the things which are&quot;: the messages to the churches (ch 2-3); 
::&quot;the things which shall be hereafter&quot;: the predictions for the future (ch 4-22) 
The &quot;things which shall be hereafter&quot; are the things that will happen as the Day of the Lord approaches and arrives. These things will have a definite &quot;buildup&quot; sequence which the careful reader can see, and which will prevent the true believers from being taken &quot;as by a thief in the night&quot;.

===Verse 20===
:&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&quot;&lt;font color=red&gt;The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven candlesticks which you saw are the seven churches&lt;/font&gt;.”'''''

''Commentary:'' The Greek word &quot;angelos&quot; means &quot;messenger&quot; and can be interpreted to refer to either a heavenly or an earthly being. This is determined by the context. The seven stars, therefore, may represent either angels assigned to the churches, or the earthly leaders of the churches. Christ holding them in His right hand signifies they have His approval. The candlesticks, as already stated, represent the churches themselves. Christ standing in the midst of them shows His leadership of the churches.

      <comment>/* How the Process Function Works */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">= Motivation =

You want to process XML documents from the web which contained in a zip file.

= Implementation =

This script uses the the unzip function in the eXist compression module.  This function uses higher order functions to filter the required components of the zipped file and to process each component.

== The Unzip Function ==
The unzip function has five input parameters, two of which are XQuery functions that are passed to the unzip function.  Each of these functions in turn have parameters.

Here is the general layout of the compression function:

 compression:unzip(
   $zip-data as xs:base64Binary, 
   $entry-filter as function, 
   $entry-filter-param as xs:anyType*, 
   $entry-data as function, 
   $entry-data-param as xs:anyType*) item()*

UnZip all the resources/folders from the provided data by calling user defined functions to determine what and how to store the resources/folders

* '''$zip-data'''	The zip file data
*  '''$entry-filter'''	A user defined function for filtering resources from the zip file. The function takes 3 parameters e.g. user:unzip-entry-filter($path as xs:string, $data-type as xs:string, $param as item()*) as xs:boolean. $type may be 'resource' or 'folder'. $param is a sequence with any additional parameters, for example a list of extracted files.If the return type is true() it indicates the entry should be processed and passed to the entry-data function, else the resource is skipped.
* '''$entry-filter-param'''	A sequence with an additional parameters for filtering function.
* '''$entry-data'''	A user defined function for storing an extracted resource from the zip file. The function takes 4 parameters e.g. user:unzip-entry-data($path as xs:string, $data-type as xs:string, $data as item()?, $param as item()*). $type may be 'resource' or 'folder'. $param is a sequence with any additional parameters
* '''$entry-data-param'''	A sequence with an additional parameters for storing function.

In the first example, we know that there is only one XML file and we intend to process the XML in the script.  Later examples store the file or files for later processing.

= Extracting a single zipped file =
&lt;pre&gt;
declare namespace fw = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/fw&quot;;

declare function fw:filter($path as xs:string, $type as xs:string, $param as item()*) as xs:boolean {
 (: pass all :)
 true()
};

declare function fw:process($path as xs:string,$type as xs:string, $data as item()? , $param as item()*) {
 (: return the XML :)
 $data
};

let $uri := request:get-parameter(&quot;uri&quot;,&quot;http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_3166-1_list_en.zip&quot;)
let $zip := httpclient:get(xs:anyURI($uri), true(), ())/httpclient:body/text()
let $filter := util:function(QName(&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/fw&quot;,&quot;fw:filter&quot;),3)
let $process := util:function(QName(&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/fw&quot;,&quot;fw:process&quot;),4)
let $xml := compression:unzip($zip,$filter,(),$process,())
return $xml
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Codes/getCountries.xq Execute]

== Sample XML Output ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;ISO_3166-1_List_en xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
   &lt;ISO_3166-1_Entry&gt;
      &lt;ISO_3166-1_Country_name&gt;AFGHANISTAN&lt;/ISO_3166-1_Country_name&gt;
      &lt;ISO_3166-1_Alpha-2_Code_element&gt;AF&lt;/ISO_3166-1_Alpha-2_Code_element&gt;
   &lt;/ISO_3166-1_Entry&gt;
   &lt;ISO_3166-1_Entry&gt;
      &lt;ISO_3166-1_Country_name&gt;ÅLAND ISLANDS&lt;/ISO_3166-1_Country_name&gt;
      &lt;ISO_3166-1_Alpha-2_Code_element&gt;AX&lt;/ISO_3166-1_Alpha-2_Code_element&gt;
   &lt;/ISO_3166-1_Entry&gt;
   ...
&lt;/ISO_3166-1_List_en&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== How the Process Function Works ==
The '''compression:unzip()''' function calls the process function for each component in the zip archive it finds.  This is known as a callback function.  You can place any valid XQuery code in the process function to do what you would like with each input file such as list or store it.

For example the following process function will list all the items in a zip file, their path, their type and the root node if the item is an XML file.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function t:process($path as xs:string, $type as xs:string, $data as item()? , $param as item()*) {
 (: return a list of the items in the zip file. :)
 &lt;item path=&quot;{$path}&quot; type=&quot;{$type}&quot;&gt;{name($data/*)}&lt;/item&gt;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Running this on a Office Open XML file returns the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;item path=&quot;[Content_Types].xml&quot; type=&quot;resource&quot;&gt;Types&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;item path=&quot;_rels/.rels&quot; type=&quot;resource&quot;&gt;Relationships&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;item path=&quot;word/_rels/document.xml.rels&quot; type=&quot;resource&quot;&gt;Relationships&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;item path=&quot;word/document.xml&quot; type=&quot;resource&quot;&gt;w:document&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;item path=&quot;word/theme/theme1.xml&quot; type=&quot;resource&quot;&gt;a:theme&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;item path=&quot;word/settings.xml&quot; type=&quot;resource&quot;&gt;w:settings&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;item path=&quot;word/fontTable.xml&quot; type=&quot;resource&quot;&gt;w:fonts&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;item path=&quot;word/webSettings.xml&quot; type=&quot;resource&quot;&gt;w:webSettings&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;item path=&quot;docProps/app.xml&quot; type=&quot;resource&quot;&gt;Properties&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;item path=&quot;docProps/core.xml&quot; type=&quot;resource&quot;&gt;cp:coreProperties&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;item path=&quot;word/styles.xml&quot; type=&quot;resource&quot;&gt;w:styles&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=  Storing the unzipped File =

You probably want to store the unzipped documents in the database. We can modify the process function to do this. We can use the third parameter to pass in the directory in which to store each file. In addition we need to create a collection to hold the unzipped files. 


&lt;source lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
declare namespace fw = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/fw&quot;;

declare function fw:filter($path as xs:string, $type as xs:string, $param as item()*) as xs:boolean {
 (: pass all :)
 true()
};

declare function fw:process($path as xs:string,$type as xs:string, $data as item()? , $param as item()*) {
 (: store the XML  in the nominated directory :)
                xmldb:store($param/@directory, $path, $data)  
};

let $baseCollection := &quot;/db/apps/zip/data/&quot;
let $uri := request:get-parameter(&quot;uri&quot;,&quot;http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_3166-1_list_en.zip&quot;)
let $unzipCollection := request:get-parameter(&quot;dir&quot;,&quot;temp&quot;)
let $zip := httpclient:get(xs:anyURI($uri), true(), ())/httpclient:body/text()
let $filter := util:function(QName(&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/fw&quot;,&quot;fw:filter&quot;),3)
let $process := util:function(QName(&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/fw&quot;,&quot;fw:process&quot;),4)

let $login :=  xmldb:login(&quot;/db&quot;,&quot;admin&quot;,&quot;password&quot;)
let $fullPath := concat($baseCollection, $unzipCollection)
let $mkdir := 
            if (xmldb:collection-available($fullPath)) then () 
            else xmldb:create-collection($baseCollection, $unzipCollection)
            
let $store := compression:unzip($zip,$filter,(),$process,&lt;param directory=&quot;{$fullPath}&quot;/&gt;)
return $store

&lt;/source&gt;

= Unzipping a zip archive  =

Zip files commonly contain multiple files. In particular Microsoft Word .docX and Excel .xslx files are zipped collections of xmlfiles which together define the document or spreadsheet.

When documents are stored in the eXist database, the mime type (media type) is inferred from the file suffix using the mime-types.xml file. Alternatively the mime type can be set explicitly when the document is stored. 

We assume here that filenames in the zip file are simple.  If there is a directory structure, this needs additional coding.

&lt;source lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
declare namespace fw = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/fw&quot;;

declare function fw:filter($path as xs:string, $type as xs:string, $param as item()*) as xs:boolean {
 (: pass all :)
 true()
};

declare function fw:process($path as xs:string,$type as xs:string, $data as item()? , $param as item()*) {
 (: store the XML  in the nominated directory :)
 
 (: we need to encode the filename to account for filenames with illegal characters like [Content_Types].xml :)
       let $path := xmldb:encode($path)
 (: ensure mime type is set properly for .rels files which are xml
    alternatively you could add this mime type to the mime-types.xml configuration file
 :)
       return
          if (ends-with($path, '.rels')) then 
                xmldb:store($param/@directory, $path, $data, 'application/xml')
          else
                xmldb:store($param/@directory, $path, $data)  
};

let $baseCollection := &quot;/db/apps/zip/data/&quot;
let $uri := request:get-parameter(&quot;uri&quot;,&quot;http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_3166-1_list_en.zip&quot;)
let $unzipCollection := request:get-parameter(&quot;dir&quot;,&quot;temp&quot;)
let $zip := httpclient:get(xs:anyURI($uri), true(), ())/httpclient:body/text()
let $filter := util:function(QName(&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/fw&quot;,&quot;fw:filter&quot;),3)
let $process := util:function(QName(&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/fw&quot;,&quot;fw:process&quot;),4)

let $login :=  xmldb:login(&quot;/db&quot;,&quot;admin&quot;,&quot;password&quot;)
let $fullPath := concat($baseCollection, $unzipCollection)
let $mkdir := 
            if (xmldb:collection-available($fullPath)) 
            then () 
            else xmldb:create-collection($baseCollection, $unzipCollection)
            
let $store := compression:unzip($zip,$filter,(),$process,&lt;param directory=&quot;{$fullPath}&quot;/&gt;)
return 
  &lt;result&gt;
    {for $file in $store
     return 
       &lt;file&gt;{$file}&lt;/file&gt;
    }
  &lt;/result&gt;


&lt;/source&gt;

= Zips with a directory structure =

Most zip files contain a directory tree of files.  This directory structure needs to be recreated in the database as the files are unzipped. We can modify the process function to create database collections as necessary, assuming that higher directories are referenced before sub directories.  

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare namespace fw = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/fw&quot;;

declare function fw:filter($path as xs:string, $type as xs:string, $param as item()*) as xs:boolean {
 (: filter any files which are not required :)
   if (ends-with($path,&quot;.bin&quot;)) then false() else true()
};

declare function fw:process($path as xs:string,$type as xs:string, $data as item()? , $param as item()*) {
    (: parse the path and create a collection if necessary :)
       let $steps := tokenize($path,&quot;/&quot;)
       let $nsteps := count($steps)
       let $filename := $steps[$nsteps]
       let $collection := string-join(subsequence($steps,1,$nsteps - 1 ),&quot;/&quot;)
       let $baseCollection := string($param/@collection)
       let $fullCollection := concat($baseCollection,&quot;/&quot;,$collection)
       let $mkdir := 
            if (xmldb:collection-available($fullCollection)) then () 
            else xmldb:create-collection($baseCollection, $collection)

       let $filename := xmldb:encode($filename)
       return
           xmldb:store($fullCollection, $filename, $data)     
};

let $baseCollection := &quot;/db/apps/zip/data/&quot;
let $path := request:get-parameter(&quot;path&quot;,&quot;http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_3166-1_list_en.zip&quot;)
let $unzipCollection := request:get-parameter(&quot;dir&quot;,&quot;temp&quot;)

let $zip :=  httpclient:get(xs:anyURI($path), true(), ())/httpclient:body/text() 

let $filter := util:function(QName(&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/fw&quot;,&quot;fw:filter&quot;),3)
let $process := util:function(QName(&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/fw&quot;,&quot;fw:process&quot;),4)

let $login :=  xmldb:login(&quot;/db&quot;,&quot;admin&quot;,&quot;password&quot;)
let $collection := concat($baseCollection, $unzipCollection)
let $mkdir := 
            if (xmldb:collection-available($collection)) then () 
            else xmldb:create-collection($baseCollection, $unzipCollection)  
           
let $store := compression:unzip($zip,$filter,(),$process,&lt;param collection=&quot;{$collection}&quot;/&gt;)
return
  &lt;result&gt;
    {for $file in $store
     return 
       &lt;file&gt;{$file}&lt;/file&gt;
    }
  &lt;/result&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

= Processing stored zip files =

It may be desirable to store the zip files in the database as binary resources before they are unzipped.  By default files with a .zip suffix are stored as binary data.  To store .docx and .xslx files in eXist, you will need to add these suffices to the entry in the $EXIST_HOME/mime-type.xml configuration file. 

Change 

&lt;source lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
       
    &lt;mime-type name=&quot;application/zip&quot; type=&quot;binary&quot;&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;ZIP archive&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;extensions&gt;.zip&lt;/extensions&gt;
    &lt;/mime-type&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

to

&lt;source lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
       
    &lt;mime-type name=&quot;application/zip&quot; type=&quot;binary&quot;&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;ZIP archive and Office Open XML&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;extensions&gt;.zip,.docx,.xlsx,.pptx&lt;/extensions&gt;
    &lt;/mime-type&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

You will need to reboot the server for this change to take effect.

The basic script remains the same with minor modifications

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $path := request:get-parameter(&quot;path&quot;,&quot;http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_3166-1_list_en.zip&quot;)
let $unzipCollection := request:get-parameter(&quot;dir&quot;,&quot;temp&quot;)

let $zip := 
   if (starts-with($path,&quot;http&quot;))
   then httpclient:get(xs:anyURI($path), true(), ())/httpclient:body/text()
   else util:binary-doc($path)
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section looks at the hardware and software components of computer systems.  You will need to be able to discuss recent developments in these areas in addition to what may be discussed in the syllabus, on this page or in your textbooks and marks will be available for this in the exam.

==Hardware and Software==
===Hardware===
'''Hardware''' is the term used to describe the physical components of a computer system.  If it can be touched and handled then it is hardware.  Examples of hardware components include:
*Mainboard
*Graphics card
*CPU
*Video capture card
*Storage devices
*Input/output devices

Storage devices can be further broken down in to Primary and Secondary storage.  Some examples of each of these are given in the table below.

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
!style=&quot;width:50%;&quot;|Primary/Internal Storage
!Secondary/External Storage
|-
|style=&quot;width:50%;&quot;|
*Internal memory, Random Access Memory (RAM)
*Hard-disc drive
|
*USB sticks
*Flash memory cards
*CD/DVD disc drives
*Floppy disc drives
|}

Input and Output devices are also very important to any computer system.  Input devices allow data to be taken from an external source and transfered on to the computer in a digital form.  Output devices take data stored on the computer and transfer this to the user in a useful form.  Some examples of these types of devices are given in the table below.

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
!style=&quot;width:50%;&quot;|Input devices
!Output devices
|-
|
*Mouse
*Keyboard
*Graphics tablet
*Webcam
*Scanner
*Trackball
*Sensors
|
*Printer
*Monitor
*Speaker
*Control devices and motors
|-

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Revelation'', also known as the ''Apocalypse'', is the last book of the ''New Testament'', and consequently of the ''Bible'' as a whole. Its name comes from the Greek, ''Apocalypsis'', the first word of the book, which means ''Revelation''. ''Revelation'' belongs to a genre known as ''apocalyptic literature'', of which there are numerous examples, both inside and outside of the Bible. 

Revelation is a fitting conclusion to the Biblical saga. Within its chapters, the tension between good and evil which began in the Garden of Eden comes to a head and finds its final resolution. While Revelation's larger themes are abundantly clear, its details provide a considerable challenge for interpreters. Revelation brings together the worlds of heaven, earth, and hell in a final confrontation between the forces of good and evil. Its characters and images are both real and symbolic, spiritual and material, and it is frequently difficult to know which is which. Its cryptic nature has ensured that it would always be a source of controversy. Nevertheless, it has not only endured, but captured the imaginations of generations of Bible students, both professionals and laypeople alike. 

==Methods of Interpretation==
Revelation is a cryptic document which has been interpreted in many ways. Most of the interpretations fall into one or more of the following categories: 
: '''''Historicist: ''''' Revelation presents a broad view of history, with the major people and events of history represented, especially where they concern Israel and the Church.
: '''''Preterist:''''' Revelation chiefly refers to the events of the apostolic era (first century AD), including the destruction of Jerusalem and its Temple, and the persecutions of the young church by the Roman Empire.
:'''''Futurist:''''' Revelation chiefly describes events which have not taken place yet, but which will come to pass at the end of this age and at the end of the world.
:'''''Symbolic''''' or '''''Idealist:''''' Revelation is purely symbolic, an allegory of the spiritual path and the ongoing struggle between good and evil. 

While it is useful to have a conceptual grasp of these approaches, it should be remembered that they are by no means mutually exclusive, and it is necessary to take all of them into account for a well-rounded understanding of this challenging document.

==Authorship==

The author of Revelation identifies himself several times as &quot;John&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. 1:1, 4, 9; 22:8&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional position, still held by many scholars, is that this John is the apostle of the same name. Those who support apostolic authorship point to the testimony of the early church fathers, beginning with Justin Martyr (c. 100-165 AD), who was an acquaintance of Polycarp (Polycarp was mentored by John).&lt;ref&gt;St. Justin Martyr, ''Dialogue with Trypho'' Chapter lxxxi.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the second century, Irenaeus (c. 115-202), Theophilus of Antioch (died c. 183), and Tertullian of North Africa (c. 160-220) gave credit to the apostle for authorship. 

Those in favor of apostolic authorship also point to stylistic similarities between ''Revelation'' and the other works traditionally accredited to the apostle, such as the identification of Jesus as the “Word of God.&quot; Differences in style are explained by the fact that the gospel, epistles, and Revelation are written in three different genres with different purposes, at different times, and possibly with different secretarial assistance. Charles Erdman, an advocate of apostolic authorship, writes:
:The author calls himself John, both in the opening and the closing verses of the book. He states that because of his Christian faith he has been banished to the isle of Patmos. He addresses the churches of Asia with a consciousness of unquestioned authority. Of no other person in the first century could these statements be made.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Erdman. ''Revelation of John: An Exposition.'' Westminster, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent times, apostolic authorship has been questioned. While most scholars are happy to accept the identification of an author named John, some suggest that this may not be John the apostle, but another John who was influential in the first century church, who is referred to as John of Patmos, after the Aegean island on which the visions were received. Textual criticism, a recent development in Biblical scholarship, has been influential in this conclusion. Those who disagree with apostolic authorship focus on the differences, rather than the similarities, in style between the Gospel of John, the epistles of John, and the Revelation, and see them as indicative of two (or more) separate authors.
 
While there have been dissenters, most scholars accept Revelation as the work of a single author, based on the overall unity of style and structure (see ''Literary Elements'', below).

==Date of Writing==
There are two dates commonly put forth for authorship: around 95 AD, near the end of the Roman emperor Domitian's reign; and around 65 AD, during the reign of Nero.&lt;ref&gt;''Before Jerusalem Fell'', Powder Springs, Georgia: American Vision, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The later date is supported by the testimony of Irenaeus (c. 115-202), who wrote that he received his information from people who knew John personally: &quot;[John's vision] was seen no very long time since, but almost in our day, towards the end of Domitian's reign.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;A.H. 5.30.3&lt;/ref&gt; Domitian, according to Eusebius of Caesarea (c. 263–339), started the persecution of Christians which resulted in John’s exile. 

The earlier date is necessitated by the preterist interpretation (see ''Methods of Interpretation,'' above) of chapter 17, verses 10 and 11, where the &quot;seven kings&quot; are regarded as the succession of Roman emperors up to the time of the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Mounce. &quot;The Book of Revelation.&quot; ''The New International Commentary on the New Testament.'' Cambridge: Eerdman's, 1997. 19-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the passage says that &quot;five have fallen,&quot; &quot;one is,&quot; and one is &quot;yet to come,&quot; the present emperor must be the sixth of the seven. Nero fits the model because there was a time of persecution during his reign. Domitian does not fit because he was not one of the seven. To arrive at the required seven, it is necessary to exclude the three short-term emperors who came after Nero -- Galba, Otho, and Vitellius, who all ruled less than a year – and to add Julius Caesar as the first, for he was not regarded by Roman historians as an emperor. Nero would then be the sixth and current emperor, which would place the date of authorship between 64 AD, when persecution broke out, and 68 AD, when Nero died. (Not all interpreters agree that the &quot;kings&quot; are seven Roman emperors. For more on the passage in question, see the commentary on 17:10-11[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Biblical_Studies/New_Testament_Commentaries/Revelation/Chapter_17#Verse_10].)

==Literary elements==
Whatever Revelation may become in the fertile fields of interpretive minds, it is first and foremost a piece of literature, and it should be understood in literary terms. This does not exclude other approaches, it merely underscores them. A number of literary elements can be identified in Revelation, such as structure, plot, major characters, and unifying themes.

===Structure===
In the first chapter, John has a vision of Christ, who gives him the following commission: “Write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will take place after this.”&lt;sup&gt;[1:19]&lt;/sup&gt; This threefold commission identifies the three primary divisions of the book:  
:Chapter 1: “the things which you have seen,” i.e. John’s vision of Christ.
:Chapters 2-3: “the things which are,” i.e. the messages to the seven Asian churches.
:Chapters 4-22: “the things which will take place after this.” Taken at face value, this refers to events which are future to the time of the visions, though whether this is actually the case, or to what extent, or how far in the future, are all a matter of debate.
 
In terms of Revelation’s overall structure, the book is built around four successive groups of seven: the messages to the seven churches, the seven seal judgments, the seven trumpet judgments, and finally, the seven bowl judgments. There are also introductory and concluding passages, and additional passages which are inserted between the main structural elements in various places throughout the book (see the page entitled ''Outline of Revelation'').

The repeated occurrence of the number seven contributes to the overall unity of Revelation. While several numbers stand out—3, 4, 7, 10, 12, 24, 144, 1000—seven appears to have a special significance.  There are seven churches symbolized by seven lampstands (1:20); the churches have seven angels symbolized by seven stars (1:20); there are seven spirits before the throne of God, symbolized by seven lamps (4:5), and also by seven horns and seven eyes (5:6); the judgment scroll has seven seals (5:1) with a corresponding set of seven &quot;seal judgments&quot;; the seventh seal unleashes seven &quot;trumpet judgments,&quot; which are heralded by seven angels (8:1-2); the seventh trumpet unleashes seven &quot;bowl judgments,&quot; where the bowls of God's wrath are poured out by seven angels (15:1); there are seven mysterious thunders about which John is not permitted to say anything (10:3); 7,000 people are killed in an earthquake (11:13); the dragon has seven heads and seven diadems on his heads (12:3); and the beast from the sea has seven heads (13:1).

One half of seven, 3½, is also a conspicuous number in Revelation, specifically as a time period: two witnesses are given power to prophesy 1,260 days, or exactly 3½ years, according to the Hebrew year of 360 days (11:3); the witnesses are then killed, and their dead bodies lie in the streets of Jerusalem for 3½ days (11:9); the &quot;woman clothed with the sun&quot; is protected in the wilderness for 1,260 days, or 3½ years (12:6); Gentiles tread the holy city underfoot for 42 months, or 3½ years (11:2); and the beast is given authority to continue for 42 months, or 3½ years (13:5).

===Plot===
A plot, or general storyline, can be identified in Revelation. The story proper is in included in chapters 4-22, but chapters 1-3 lay the groundwork. These first three chapters consist of a brief introduction followed by seven separate messages conveyed by the author to seven churches. The larger themes of the book as a whole – judgment, salvation, the coming of the Messiah, etc. – are exposed in these messages, each of which is tailor-made for the church in question. Each message assesses how that particular church is doing, and tells it what change, if any, needs to be made. In a nutshell, the churches are each presented with a choice: to be faithful or not to be faithful. The potential consequences of their choices are graphically illustrated in the story proper, in ch. 4-22. The messages to the churches also serve as a device to convey a message to a wider audience, for each church's message ends with: &quot;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches&quot; (2:7, etc.).

The plot of the story proper (ch. 4-22) is driven by a powerful conflict between the forces, both earthly and spiritual, of good and evil. Expressed in the simplest terms (for more detail, see the page entitled ''Outline of Revelation''), it is as follows: 
:1) There is a time of great tribulation on the Earth which combines natural disasters with war on an unprecedented scale. 
:2) The &quot;Lamb&quot; saves his people from the tribulation, destroys the wicked, and ushers in an age of peace. 
:3) After the age of peace, there is a second, brief time of trouble which results in the permanent banishment of the wicked.
:4) A new heaven and a new earth replace the old, and the people of God go to live in the presence of God and Christ in a heavenly city described as the &quot;new Jerusalem.&quot; 

(See the commentary for different interpretations of these details. This section is only concerned with what appears on the surface.)

===Characters===
Revelation has an array of colorful characters. The protagonist, known throughout most of the book as the &quot;Lamb,&quot; is a hero of magnificent proportions. Almost as impressive is the antagonist, Satan, an archvillain who is also known as the &quot;dragon.&quot; There are various other characters, both good and bad, including the narrator (John), two witnesses, the archangel Michael, the beast from the land, the beast from the sea, the woman clothed with the sun, the great harlot (Babylon the Great), numerous angels, and the four strange creatures around the throne of God. Some of the characters appear to be actual persons (whether on the spiritual or the physical plane), while others appear to be purely symbolic.

 |description=This subject area contains study guides on books in '''[[w:fantasy literature|fantasy literature]]''': a genre which is characterized by the use of magic and other supernatural forms as a primary element of plot, theme, and/or setting. Many works within the genre take place on fictional planes or planets where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes.

== Preface ==

This is a list of all formulae needed for [[VCE Specialist Mathematics/Units 3 and 4: Specialist Mathematics|Units 3 and 4: Specialist Mathematics]].

== Formulae ==

=== Ellipses, Circles and Hyperbolas ===
==== Ellipses ====

'''General formula:'''

* &lt;math&gt;\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

'''General Notes:'''

* Point &lt;math&gt;(h,k)&lt;/math&gt; defines the ellipses center.
* Points &lt;math&gt;(\pm a + h,k)&lt;/math&gt; defines the ellipses domain, and horizontal endpoints - i.e. horizontal stretch.

* Points &lt;math&gt;(h,\pm b + k)&lt;/math&gt; defines the ellipses range, and vertical endpoints - i.e. vertical stretch.
==== Circles ====
'''General formula:''' 

*&lt;math&gt;(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2&lt;/math&gt;

'''General Notes:'''

* Point &lt;math&gt;(h,k)&lt;/math&gt; defines the circles center.
* Points &lt;math&gt;(\pm r + h,k)&lt;/math&gt; defines the circles domain - i.e. stretch.

* Points &lt;math&gt;(h,\pm r + k)&lt;/math&gt; defines the circles range - i.e. stretch.

* A circle is a subset of an ellipse, such that &lt;math&gt;a = b = r&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Hyperbolas ====

'''General formulae:'''  

* &lt;math&gt;\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} - \frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;
'''General Notes:'''

* Point &lt;math&gt;(h,k)&lt;/math&gt; defines the hyperbolas center.

* Points &lt;math&gt;(\pm a + h,k)&lt;/math&gt; defines the hyperbolas domain, &lt;math&gt;[\pm a + h, \pm \infty)&lt;/math&gt;.

* The switch in positions of the fractions containing x and y, indicate the type of hyperbola - i.e. vertical or horizontal. The hyperbola is horizontal in the first, and negative in the second of the General hyperbolic formulae above.

* Graphs &lt;math&gt;y=\pm (\pm a + h,k)&lt;/math&gt; defines the hyperbolas domain &lt;math&gt;[\pm a + h, \pm \infty)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Trignometric Functions ===

==== Sin ====
General formula:
* &lt;math&gt;y = a\sin(n(x-b)) + c&lt;/math&gt;

* A period is equal to &lt;math&gt;[\frac{2\pi}{n}]&lt;/math&gt;

* The domain, unless restricted, is &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

* The range is equal to &lt;math&gt;[\pm a +c]&lt;/math&gt;, as the range of &lt;math&gt;y = \sin(x), y \in [-1,1]&lt;/math&gt;, see unit circle.

* The horizontal translation of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is reflected in the x-intercepts.

* A period is equal to &lt;math&gt;[\frac{\pi}{n}]&lt;/math&gt;

* The domain, &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \frac{k\pi}{2n}, k \in \mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt;, as &lt;math&gt; y = \tan(x), x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \frac{k\pi}{2}, k \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, indicating the asymptotes.

* The range, unless restricted, is &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, as the range of &lt;math&gt;y = \tan(x), y \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, see unit circle.

* The horizontal translation of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is reflected in the x-intercepts.

      <comment>/* Verses 4-5 */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Chapter 2 begins the messages to the seven churches. Chapters 2 and 3 are the &quot;things that are&quot; division of Revelation. God sees and addresses the conditions that existed within the seven churches at that time. However, there is also an element of future application: Modern churches will be able to see the same conditions within themselves. If God told an early church not to do something, modern churches will do well to assume He has not changed His mind! Please notice that there is not one word from John within the seven messages. God’s message for the churches is enveloped in love and stamped with corrective and constructive criticism. He begins by commending the churches for their virtuous qualities (e.g. works, patience, faith, perseverance, service, &amp; love- rf. v. 2-3 9, 13, &amp; 19). God then corrects that which causes Him displeasure, such as forsaking their first love (v.4), wrong confession (v. 9), holding to false doctrines (v 14), and following false teachers (v 20). This correction is followed by a call for repentance (e.g. v. 5, 16,  &amp; 21-22). Fourth, God cautions the churches of the cost and consequences of continuing in their wrongful ways (v. 5, 16, &amp; 22-23). Indeed, John has transcribed God's voice word-for-word. This illustrates an important point: When God speaks, people will do well not to reword His message. Such rewording could lose some nuance of meaning.

==The Message to the Church at Ephesus==

===Verse 1===
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;To the angel of the church of Ephesus write: These things says He that holds the seven stars in His right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks&lt;/font&gt;.'''''

''Commentary:'' The city of Ephesus was an important commercial and religious center in John's time. It was John's headquarters before his exile, and he returned there after his release. Ephesus was the &quot;mother&quot; church that established the other six churches who received these messages. The line &quot;To the angel of the church of Ephesus write&quot; is a good argument for the stars representing earthly church leaders. Actual angels would not need a written letter, for they have the ability to directly know God's will.

Ephesus was a port city which was situated at the estuary of the River Cayster. It was the chief city of the region and one of the most important business and cultural centers in the empire outside of Rome. Although in John’s time it was on the coast, it is now several miles inland due to natural changes in the coastline. Its ruins have been extensively explored and excavated. Paul, Peter, and John all spent time there, with John being in the position of leadership at the time of his exile.

The author of Revelation probably included a letter of warning to the city of Ephesus because of the city's connection with emperor worship and with other powerful religious cults.  Within the city of Ephesus, there were at least two temples dedicated to Augustus, the first Roman Emperor to be worshiped.  The connections between the Ephesus in the Book of Revelation and emperor worship are also further strengthened if one believes that the Book of Revelation was recorded during the reign of Domitian.  Under Domitian, Ephesus was named a guardian of the imperial cult and likely had statues of or temples dedicated to Domitian or his brother and predecessor, Titus.  In addition to being a seat of emperor worship, Ephesus also was home to other well established and popular religious cults such as the cult of Artemis/Diana, which was centered around the impressive temple dedicated to the goddess.

===Verses 2-3===
:&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;I know your works, and your labour, and your patience, and how you cannot bear them which are evil. And you have tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and have found them liars,&lt;/font&gt;''''' &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;and have persevered, and have patience, and for my name's sake have laboured, and have not fainted&lt;/font&gt;.''''' 

''Commentary:'' The church is commended for its doctrinal soundness, refusal of corrupting influences, perseverance and endurance in the face of persecution, and for the fact that they have worked the Lord's will with proper motive and without turning back (fainting).
There is alor of imagery to Christ's power in this verse. This verse not only shows that God is the one to hold the world together and is all powerful, but it also shows that one can find comfort in him. In this verse, the writer is most likey referring to a coming of Jesus and judgement.

===Verses 4-5===
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;Nevertheless, I have somewhat against you, because you have left your first love&lt;/font&gt;.''''' &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;Remember, therefore, from whence you are fallen, and repent, and do the first works, or else I will come to you quickly, and will remove your candlestick out of its place, except you repent&lt;/font&gt;.'''''

''Commentary:'' The church is sharply rebuked because they have fallen into complacence. Although the Ephesians had centered their activities around God, they relegated Him to a substandard position in their lives, not making their love for God their number one priority. The love they once had was waning.When the church at Ephesus was young, it actively evangelized the country, establishing daughter churches and gaining converts. Now they are &quot;resting on their laurels&quot;, doing ''good'' work, but not doing the ''fervent'' work the Lord wanted. He warns that He will set them aside (but not completely reject them) unless they return to the Will of the Lord. It seems the warning was not heeded, for despite efforts to save it, the famous port of Ephesus gradually silted up and the city was left high and dry, cut off from the main source of its wealth. All that remains of Ephesus today are its ruins.

===Verse 6===
:&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;But this you have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate&lt;/font&gt;.'''''

''Commentary:'' The Nicolaitans were early Christian-pagan syncretists, false teachers that crept into the church, who disguised themselves as followers of Christ – who professed to be His ministers and servants – but who led the people astray. They would create long prayers that would be performed publicly. Peter wrote of them that they “despise authority. They are presumptuous, self-willed, and like brutish beasts speak evil of the things they do not understand. They are spots and blemishes in the churches, carousing in their own deceptions while they feast with you&quot;. Even though the Nicolaitans had committed a horrible sin, it is known that Jesus does not hate the sinner, only the sin. Jesus taught his disciples to watch out for false teachers and prophesies. He declared the teachings of the Nicolaitans as corrupt and immoral.

===Verse 7===
:&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God&lt;/font&gt;.'''''

''Commentary:'' &quot;He that has an ear, let him hear&quot; comes from a command from the Gospels (Matthew 11:15, Mark 4:9, Luke 9:8)  and is repeated later in Revelation 13:9 means that everyone reading or hearing this message should strive to understand it and take action to come into compliance with God's wishes. It is also a reminder that the author wrote this book from visions of the Lord meaning that these visions are interpreted.  Those with the ability to understand these dreams are to report what the spirit is telling them.
Though this letter is to the Ephesians, it is a personal command and promise rather than corporate.  The reward of listening to the Lord is eating from the tree of life (Genesis 3:22 and Revelation 22:2).  
The paradise of God is also mentioned in Luke 23:43.  It can be interpreted of a New Jerusalem or a place like that in the Garden of Eden, a perfect living with God.

==The Message to the Church at Smyrna==

===Verse 8===
:&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These things says the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive&lt;/font&gt;.'''''

''Commentary:'' Also on the coast, about forty miles to the north of Ephesus, was the city of [[w:Smyrna|Smyrna]], the “glory of Asia.” It still exists today, though it is now called Izmir. Like Ephesus, Smyrna had the double advantage of being located on a major highway and having an excellent port. Rich farmland surrounded the city, and it was a natural terminal for a busy inland trade route. The city had been destroyed by the Lydians in 627 B.C. and was little more than a village for three centuries. But in the third century B.C., Smyrna began to revive as a business and cultural center, and by the end of the first century, it had made so much progress that it rivaled Ephesus in importance. Smyrna, therefore, was known as the city that had died and come back to life. So Jesus’ opening words were especially significant for the church there.

The city’s leadership was consistently loyal to Rome. This loyalty had initially been inspired by the threat of Antiochus the Great of Syria at the beginning of the second century B.C. This threat made Rome a very desirable friend and ally. As a token of Smyrna’s loyalty, a temple was erected in the city to “the goddess Rome” in 195 B.C. Over two hundred years later, in 26 A.D., construction was begun on another temple for the worship of the Roman emperor, who at the time was Tiberius. The city was famous as a center of learning, particularly in the fields of science and medicine.

Again we have proof that the speaker is none other than Jesus Christ. Being eternal and immutable, neither the Father nor the Holy Spirit ever suffered death. Only the Son, as the human manifestation of the Godhead, can make that claim. He suffered His earthly body to die in order to redeem mankind from sin, and now He has returned to His rightful place in the Godhead.

===Verse 9===
:&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;I know your works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but you are rich,) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan&lt;/font&gt;.'''''

''Commentary:'' The church at Smyrna was experiencing problems with Jewish converts who had not fully understood the doctrine of salvation by grace, and the nature of Christ's all-sufficient atonement. As a result, they were still bound to a legalistic form of religion and they insisted that it was necessary for converts to Christianity follow the laws of Moses. This is contrary to the Gospel because it puts works into the salvation picture, thus negating Christ's finished work of redemption, for, as Paul says, &quot;by grace are ye saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast&quot; (Eph 2:8-9). The church was also undergoing severe persecution. This hostility caused the Christians to lose all of their possessions to the Jews. Despite losing all of their earthly things, they still remained rich because they remained unwavering in their faith.

===Verse 10===
:&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;Fear none of those things which you shall suffer. Behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried, and you shall have tribulation ten days. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you a crown of life&lt;/font&gt;.'''''

''Commentary:'' Smyrna was known for its architecture, especially its beautiful temples and its public buildings, which formed a ring around the top of Mount Pagos, like a crown. It is in reference to this “crown of Smyrna” that Jesus says, “Be faithful unto death, and I will give you a crown of life.”  The crown might also refer to the laurel wreath which Olympic champions would wear.  One of Smyrna’s claims to fame was its hosting of such games. In addition to these games, Smyrna is also known to be the home of the ancient Greek poet, Homer. The emblem which the city used to represent itself was a wreath.  Clearly, there would have been many images going through the original readers’ minds&lt;ref&gt;Witherington, Ben.  Revelation.  Cambridge University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;. . This wreath may also be connected to the wreath of thorns that Jesus wore at his crucifixion. 

Jesus gives no condemnation to the church at Smyrna, but encourages them to continue as they are no matter how bad things get. He warns them that they have a rough road ahead, but promises them it will be of short duration. Again, a reward is promised for faithful service.

A note on the use of “10 days.”  This is not a literal prediction.  It is known that the persecutions in Smyrna lasted much longer than this.  Ten is used in Revelation, as well as elsewhere, to represent completion.  By using ten here, John is telling the people of Smyrna that there will be an end.  By using days instead of months or years, he probably means that the time of suffering will be short&lt;ref&gt;Witherington, Ben.  Revelation.  Cambridge University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Verse 11===
:&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He that overcomes shall not be hurt by the second death&lt;/font&gt;.'''''

''Commentary:'' The second death is eternal destruction in the lake of fire, reserved for the unbelievers (Revelation 20:14,15). The implication is that the believers at Smyrna might suffer and even die at the hands of men, but if they kept their faith, their reward would be certain. 





==The Message to the Church at Pergamos==

===Verse 12===
:&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write: These things says He which has the sharp sword with two edges&lt;/font&gt;.'''''

''Commentary:'' [[w:Pergamon|Pergamos]], or Pergamum, was about a hundred miles north of Ephesus, in the region known as Mysia. It was situated about fifteen miles inland. There is still a small town on the site today, though over the years the name has changed slightly and it is now called Bergama. Pergamos’ time of glory had been in the third and second centuries B.C., when it was the capital of a small independent kingdom. In the second century, at the instigation of King Eumenes II (197-159 B.C.), a library was built which was second only to that of Alexandria, in northern Egypt. There was also a famous school of sculpture. The city’s affluence was tied to a number of flourishing industries, including agriculture, wool products, silver, and parchment, which was invented there. It became a part of the Roman province of Asia when King Attalus III, probably sensing the inevitability of Roman domination, bequeathed the kingdom to Rome in 133 B.C. Jesus says, “These things says he who has the sharp two-edged sword” (2:12). The sharp, two-edged sword is apparently a figurative way of referring to the power of words, for in the previous chapter, John describes Jesus as having a sharp, two-edged sword coming out of his mouth (1:16), and later on in this chapter, Jesus himself refers to the sword of his mouth (2:16). This is a fitting introduction for a city which was famous for its parchment and its library. 

The sharp sword with two edges is the Word of God. In this case, it refers not just to the Scriptures, but also to the power of God to judge and to punish. The church will be threatened with judgment in the next verses.

===Verse 13===
:&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;I know your works, and where you dwell, even where Satan's seat is, and you hold fast My name, and have not denied My faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was My faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells&lt;/font&gt;.'''''

''Commentary:'' Jesus' words: “I know... where you dwell, where Satan’s throne is” are a reference to the “throne of Zeus” which was located on the top of a hill overlooking the city. Zeus, as the chief of the gods, was a particular symbol of paganism, and the city was a major center for pagan cults. In addition to Zeus, there were temples dedicated to Athena (goddess of wisdom), Apollo (god of prophecy, music and poetry), and Asklepios (god of healing). It also became the site of the first temple erected for the worship of Caesar in 29 B.C., during the reign of Augustus. Some of these temples employed “priestesses,” who were actually prostitutes, as a part of their worship. The church at Pergamos, therefore, was in an especially precarious position among the early churches. Pergamos (Roman Pergamum) was a veritable melting pot of pagan religions and emperor worship. We are not told who Antipas was, but he apparently was killed by the unbelievers. Jesus commends the church for holding firm in the face of the Satanic influences and, it seems, in the face of physical violence as well.

===Verse 14===
:&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;But I have a few things against you, because you have there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication&lt;/font&gt;.'''''

''Commentary:'' The author alludes to the diviner Balaam of Numbers 22.5-24.25.  Balaam is further mentioned in Numbers 31:16.  Balaam led the Israelites to compromise their faith in Christianity and engage in sins such as sexual relations with outsiders and idolatry.  The phrase &quot;to eat things sacrifices to idols&quot; could refer to either participating in ritual banquets or simply partaking of food that had been sacrificed in a pagan temple.  This food could have been unknowingly purchased in the market by the Christians of Pergamum. The phrase &quot;commit fornication&quot; is probably not meant to be taken literally.  This is likely a metaphor that refers not to sexual infidelity, but spiritual or religious infidelity.

===Verse 15===
:&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;So have you also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate&lt;/font&gt;.'''''

''Commentary:'' Again we meet the Nicolaitans, whose doctrine was not that much different from the followers of Balaam. It will be useful to repeat here the commentary of Verse 6: The Nicolaitans were early Christian-pagan syncretists, false teachers that crept into the church, who disguised themselves as followers of Christ – who professed to be His ministers and servants – but who led the people astray. Peter wrote of them that they “despise authority. They are presumptuous, self-willed, and like brutish beasts speak evil of the things they do not understand. They are spots and blemishes in the churches, carousing in their own deceptions while they feast with you&quot;.





===Verse 16===
:&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;Repent, or else I will come to you quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth&lt;/font&gt;.'''''

''Commentary:'' The entire church is warned to repent of these sins and stop tolerating the false teachers, or else Christ Himself will judge and punish them. The church must discipline itself and not tolerate false teaching and immorality within.  The sword of his mouth is a reference back to Rev. 1.16 where John sees Christ with seven stars in his right hand and the &quot;two-edged sword in his mouth&quot; and also a reference to Rev. 19.15 where the sword has the power to &quot;strike down the nations.&quot;

===Verse 17===
:&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows except he who receives it&lt;/font&gt;.'''''

''Commentary:'' An unusually cryptic verse, but the meaning is simple: Those who manage to hold fast to the true faith and do not fall victim to the heresies will be sustained (given the manna or bread of life) and a name in the Book of Life which assures them a place in God's Kingdom. Jesus said, &quot;Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that one may eat of it and not die&quot; (Jn 6:49-50).

(See also the commentary on 3:12 [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Biblical_Studies/New_Testament_Commentaries/Revelation/Chapter_3#Verse_12].)

==The Message to the Church at Thyatira==

===Verse 18===
:&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These things says the Son of God, who has His eyes like to a flame of fire, and His feet are like fine brass&lt;/font&gt;.'''''

''Commentary:'' About eighty miles to the north of Ephesus and about fifty miles inland lay the city of Thyatira, known today as Akhisar. The city had been founded by Seleucus I in the early third century and was therefore a “son of Seleucus.” It was not a city of great importance, but it was a commercial center, and there were a number of trade guilds. It was also a garrison town. The Thyatirans were expert metalworkers who were known for their work with alloys, with which they made helmets, swords, armor, and no doubt other useful implements of a more domestic nature. Jesus’ opening words to the city, as the &quot;son of Seleucus&quot; which was also famous for its metalwork, will have immediately caught the church’s attention.

Thyatira was the hometown of Lydia, Paul's first convert in Macedonia (Acts 16:14). The city was dominated by a dye and cloth industry, and was famed for a purple dye much prized in those times. The fire and brass references are an indication that judgment will be given to this church. Again, Christ directly states His identity as the speaker.

===Verse 19===
:&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;I know your works, and love, and service, and faith, and your patience. And as to your works, the last are more than the first&lt;/font&gt;.'''''

''Commentary:'' &quot;The last are more than the first&quot; is not made clear. Possibly Jesus was commending the church for an improvement in their works over time, or it may have meant something specific that the church itself would have understood. 





===Verses 20-23a===
:&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;Notwithstanding, I have a few things against you, because you suffer that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.&lt;/font&gt;''''' &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;And I gave her space to repent of her fornication, and she repented not.&lt;/font&gt;''''' &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;Behold, I will cast her into a sickbed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds,&lt;/font&gt;''''' &lt;sup&gt;23a&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;and I will kill her children with death&lt;/font&gt;.''''' 

''Commentary:'' A self-proclaimed prophetess at Thyatira was leading the church into false doctrine and immorality. Jesus calls her &quot;Jezebel&quot; in reference to the Old Testament Jezebel (I Kings 16, II Kings 9), who was a queen who promoted the worship of Baal.  This woman is referred to as Jezebel because her actions were the same as those of that earlier false teacher. Jesus implies that He gave her some sign or warning, which she has ignored. He warns that He intends to punish her, and that He will visit trouble upon those who tolerate her, unless they repent. Her &quot;children&quot; are Jezebel's &quot;disciples&quot;, those who continue to follow and believe her.  The phrase &quot;commit adultery with her&quot; in verse 22 likely refers not to literally having sexual relations with her, but instead to engaging in idolatry with her.

===Verse 23b===
:&lt;sup&gt;23b&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;And all the churches shall know that I am He which searches the minds and hearts, and I will give to every one of you according to your works.&lt;/font&gt;'''''

''Commentary:'' The implication seems to be that the punishment of &quot;Jezebel&quot; and her followers will be obvious to the churches, and will serve as a reminder that God cannot be deceived. He knows not only the deeds, but also the motives behind them, and He will judge everyone with perfect justice. 

This passage can be illustrated in modern times by the Catholic belief in mortal and venial sins. In Catholicism, sins are of two types: mortal--a sin (like murder, suicide, etc.) that is judged more harshly if not confessed and repented before death--and venial--the more basic sins (like lying, impure actions/thoughts, etc.). This passage reflects the Catholic belief that God judges according to our works and sins, not just based on one's belief in salvation.

===Verses 24-25===
:&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;But to you I say, and to the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and who have not known the depths of Satan (as they say), I will put upon you no other burden.&lt;/font&gt;''''' &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;But what you have, hold fast till I come.&lt;/font&gt;'''''

''Commentary:'' There was a remnant among the church who had not accepted the false teachings, and who had resisted the tolerance of them. To these, Jesus says He will ask nothing more. He tells them to stay firm in their convictions and wait for His return.

===Verses 26-29===
:&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;And he that overcomes, and keeps my works to the end, to him will I give power over the nations,&lt;/font&gt;''''' &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;and &quot;he shall rule them with a rod of iron, as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to pieces,&quot;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;[Ps 2:9]&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;font color=red&gt;even as I received of my Father.&lt;/font&gt;''''' &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;And I will give him the morning star.&lt;/font&gt;''''' &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.&lt;/font&gt;'''''

''Commentary:'' The obedient believer will be given a place of authority in the Millennial Kingdom (Revelation 12:5, 19:15, 20:4). In Revelation 22:16,  Jesus refers to himself as the morning star. Therefore, all whomever remains unmoving to temptation, the Lord will allow them to be partakers in His glory and power.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''c) Please follow the format which has been exemplified in Chapter 1 (unless you're a Wiki wizard and can improve it).''

I'm not a &quot;wiki wizard&quot;, but I can make a suggestion to improve the format.  I recommend that you use a template for the formatting.  That way when you change the template, everything that's using it gets updated.  The pages pretty much just have content then and do not worry about formatting.  

I did develop [[:Template:Bible verse]] a while back, and you might find that useful, but I'd suggest using it as more of a starting point.  Or maybe make a template that uses it.  The template could have two or three arguments, and would be used like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{Bible commentary
|cite = Revelation 1:1,2
|verse =     
1 The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his servants things which must 
shortly come to pass. And he sent and signified it by his angel to his servant John, 2 who bore 
record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. 
|commentary =
The opening indicates the order of the message's transmission: a) from God, b) to Jesus, c) to an angel, 
d) to John, e) to the servants of God. While John received the actual visions, however, we only have his 
descriptions of them. One senses that words are inadequate to describe what he actually saw. The verse 
goes on to say that the things contained within the prophecy will happen &quot;shortly.&quot; This has variously 
been understood as from the perspective of the audience (anything from minutes to years), in historical 
terms (hundreds or thousands of years), or from the point of view of an eternal Deity (for whom 10,000 
years would be nothing).
}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
Then by changing the template you can do all kinds of things.  Take a look at [[:Template:EWP]] and [[:Template:Species id]] as used [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Nature/Edible Wild Plants|here]] and [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Nature/Amphibians|here]] for examples.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 01:24, 1 April 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am Unable to find an appropriate place to post a comment about a book. Surely if this is the discussion page, it should be here. My comment is... While searching on the Internet for information I followed a link to wikipedia books and found myself Reading somthing which made no sence! This I discovered was because it was not a direct link to a book but a page from within. My point is  that when Internet users /searchers are unfamilar with wikibooks, they may not realise that that page they are Reading is a page from a book. 

Here is the link I followed for instance. 

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Handbook_of_Genetic_Counseling/Reciprocal_Translocation 

While I see that it follows the naming convention required by wikibooks, it should not come up in searchs without proper explation. Perhaps there should be a little paragraph at the top of the page to explain to visitors that they ate viewing a page from a book and direct them to the begining...'a very good place to start' 

As stands there is a link: Handbook of Genetic Counseling
(known only because it's blue) with a less than sign before it. This is not sufficiently explanatory.

Regards 
    
Mbbroom.

Thanks for moving this over, Adrignola. There's no way to preserve the article history, is there? [[User:Kwamikagami|Kwamikagami]] ([[User talk:Kwamikagami|talk]]) 21:11, 2 February 2010 (UTC)
:I'm afraid we can only copy-paste the history on this talk page if that's what you're thinking of.  If [[Special:Import]] will work properly in the future I could history merge it, but as it was I could only get the latest revision with it without getting an error.  The original may be too large, or, as I suspect, it has problems if an article's been moved in its history.

Oh well. 

I added some texts to the phonology section. I figured they were more appropriate here than at Wikipedia. Please let me know if you think they're inappropriate here for any reason. [[User:Kwamikagami|—Kwami]] ([[User talk:Kwamikagami|talk]]) 07:31, 3 February 2010 (UTC)

I thought that the refs would be better placed in the chapters where they're referenced. That only left two general refs in the biblio, so I moved them to the main page and blanked the biblio page. If that's not appropriate, please copy my section to that page - I really don't think we need more than those two refs in a general bibliography. [[User:Kwamikagami|—Kwami]] ([[User talk:Kwamikagami|talk]]) 08:30, 3 February 2010 (UTC)

I'm wondering, do you think we should move the longer texts to a chapter &quot;Texts&quot;? (Done. Much more accessible.) [[User:Kwamikagami|—Kwami]] ([[User talk:Kwamikagami|talk]]) 09:07, 3 February 2010 (UTC)
:Very nice.  Everything you've done so far is certainly appropriate.  I hope you'll find the flexibility Wikibooks provides in teaching a subject refreshing.  This and the [[Chess]] books both stand out in my mind as excellent examples of cross-wiki cooperation and integration between Wikipedia and Wikibooks, with each project complementing the other. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:07, 3 February 2010 (UTC)

== Print version ==
I see that [[Chess]] has a &quot;printable&quot; link.  Is it possible to create a link like that for Na'vi, or even a &quot;whole book in one page&quot; link (it doesn't necessarily need to be printable)?  The chapter structure is great for browsing and instruction, but for research and reference lookup having it all in one page is very handy.  It lets you do a &quot;find&quot; in your browser for terms or vocab and quickly see everyplace they appear in the whole document. - Erimeyz --[[Special:Contributions/69.45.101.10|69.45.101.10]] ([[User talk:69.45.101.10|talk]]) 20:37, 3 February 2010 (UTC)

:Word processors do this, where you have chapters set up as separate docs, but links on a central page, which then displays them all at once. Is there a template such as &quot;chapter X&quot; which would display the current contents of that chapter? We could then place a series of such links on a subpage so people like Eri can browse the whole book. [[User:Kwamikagami|—Kwami]] ([[User talk:Kwamikagami|talk]]) 22:22, 3 February 2010 (UTC)

:The &quot;whole book on a page&quot; link should be easily doable, as should be a printable version: both would include all chapters using template inclusion, with the printable version adjusting markup a little. If we really wanted to have that, I think I would be able to do it. We'd maybe have to take care of some things, like notes and references sections (though the Wiki is clever enough to allow multiple notes sections and do the right thing).

::Yes, I just saw how it's done. I don't have time right now to do it, but will get it later, unless you want to give it a shot. 
::I imagine we could set up each of the chapters this way too: a link to the text, followed by a template to display the refs. Then in the integrated version we'd have just the one ref template. Though that would make the chapter texts a pain to edit. 
::Will the cross-chapter linking still work it the full-text version? [[User:Kwamikagami|—Kwami]] ([[User talk:Kwamikagami|talk]]) 22:25, 3 February 2010 (UTC)

:::I set up a first draft of the print version document at [[Na'vi/Print version]]. It's not nearly perfect, e.g., the TOC still appears, and it appears only at the start of the second chapter, but those are things I know how to fix.
:::Cross-chapter linking will probably not work as intended as it is now. The links will still work alright, but they'll continue to point to the separate chapter articles. But this can be solved with some little template magic along the lines of &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, I think.

:::Okay, I got rid of the TOC in the current draft of the print version. What about notes and references? Do we want to have one section of each per chapter (&lt;s&gt;that's what we have now&lt;/s&gt;), or do we want to collect all notes and/ or references at the end of the document? Since &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;references/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is pretty clever, it shouldn't be hard at all to have one big notes and references section at the end of the document. Right now, with 12 notes/ references blocks it looks a bit cluttered, so I guess I'd prefer the notes/references at the end.

:::&lt;s&gt;Cross-chapter linking works now. Depending on whether the cross-chapter link's target is a chapter, or an anchor within a chapter, different changes are necessary.&lt;/s&gt;

:::&lt;s&gt;Since the anchor link is in fact easier to write (no &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; necessary), we might want to drop chapter links altogether.

::::The first note under 'modal verbs' was placed as a ref because of the ref it contained. It looks as though that has a work-around, but I don't know the syntax.

I don't know if the same thing works on WB as on WP.  I'm not sure it's necessary; it was handy for what I was trying to do in WP, but here on WB I think we've got more flexibility to reference sources in whatever way best fits the narrative flow of the textbook, rather than having to place cites close to facts.

I revised the print version slightly to pull the introduction but not the table of contents, so changes to the introduction don't have to be copied manually to the print version.  Additionally, I added {{tlx|chapnav}} to the pages for easy navigation between pages.    You'll find navigation links at the bottom of the pages as well as sitting out-of-the-way in the top-right of pages.  That will hopefully ease frustrations for those preferential to a single-page version of things they're used to and means no using the back button or going up a level to go down a level.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:50, 4 February 2010 (UTC)

:Hey, that's looking pretty good! 

:One comment, it would be nice if the Bibliography on the main page showed up one the print version, it its own section at the end, before the Notes. (Or maybe it would be easier just to recreate that as a really short page?)

:It greys out because in this system &quot;poor&quot; is equivalent to unreviewed, which then requires all three categories to be set to poor and the revision you are looking at will no longer be reviewed.  At that point a notice will appear asking you to review the changes since the last reviewed version, basically undoing what you just did.  To get an understanding of what this system is intended to do, consider the base level of review equivalent to patrolling a page.  It only says there is no vandalism.  Higher levels of review say a quality check has been done; however that highest level is only accessible to ''reviewers'', not ''editors''.

:This book is not exclusively about grammar, but also about the language in general: apart from grammar, we also have history, phonology, a small lexicon, and texts. On Wikibooks, it seems to be commonplace that books about a language are simply named &quot;[Language]&quot;, for instance, [[Italian]], [[French]], [[German]], etc. You're right that the other books also offer language lessons which we don't, but still, I think that &quot;Na'vi&quot; is the proper title for this book.

::I only count 17 in [[Subject:English language]].  One thing to note in regards to this is that new contributors to Wikibooks often will start a new book on a topic, in their own style, rather than finish or work on an existing one.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What Are They? ==
Tornadoes are a whirlwind that forms over land. They are spawned from thunderstorms, most of which are known as supercells. They form mainly over the plains where the cold, dry air of the north, and the warm humid air of the south make contact, forming unstable air. This unstable air creates updrafts, downdrafts, wind shear, and more. This is what creates the conditions for the formation of a tornado.

====LES HÉRITIERS DE LA PEUR====
&lt;br /&gt;
Un manuel des terriens sur l’Afrique




Edition 2007&lt;br /&gt;

==Remerciements==

Je remercie cette personne qui m’a amené au Touquet Paris plage là où tout a commencé. Le Touquet Paris plage est une station balnéaire. Avec des habitations (château dans des propriétés privées) autour de la ville, le Touquet est une attraction touristique. Cette balade quelque minute autour des propriétés privées des ISFards  sans exception m’a ouvert les yeux. Là le piéton a le droit de fouler que le trottoir qui reste ouvert de droit à tout le monde, tant mieux faute de quoi je n’aurais pas pu ouvrir les yeux.

Je rends hommage à tout corps professoral de chaque institution dans laquelle j’ai séjourné. Du maternel à la Fac en passant par APAPER-Kigali avec les professeurs dont les noms m’échappent complètement mais ça ne m’empêcherais pas de les remercier. Rusasa l’école qui m’a accueilli à l’époque du tumulte (1994) rwandais. Gahondogo où j’ai fait le pas avant d’aller dans une plus ou moins illustre école primaire de l’époque : Nyamagumba. Ici je signalerais au passage  particulièrement les noms de mes anciens professeurs Donatille, Rwabukumba, Nyiramahane,… dont le charme et l’affection m’ont encouragé.

Je n’oublierais pas les trois premières années qui ont marqué mon premier sevrage. Pour la première fois me voici éloigné de ma famille. Théogènes et Nduwayezu m’ont tendu la main. Qu’ils ressentent combien leur geste m’a couvert comme un oiseau construit un nid pour son nouveau né. Au passage je signalerais les grands personnages dans mes études à Gatovu Senzira (ancien directeur) et Calixte (prof d’histoire à cette époque) leur charme m’a conduit droit devant vers le but et je leur assure que je ne m’en suis jamais éloigné. Et je suis près du but.

Vers le but je suis passé par le collège Saint-André où mon  cercle d’amitié s’est formidablement agrandi avec Augustin, Freddy, Olivier, Straton, Chris qui m’ont montrés qui j’étais et qui ont semés en moi cet esprit d’équipe. L’esprit qu’il me fallait sans eux j’en aurais loupé un ingrédient important dans ma vie. Je leur serais toujours reconnaissant. Comme d’habitude ici il faut signaler les éminents professeurs qui m’ont hissé à un rang décisif pour la conquête de moi-même. Bakinahe, Musampa, Kangali, Mitima, Butera (ex directeur), Sr Yvonne, et la promotion professorale de 2005 en général, cette étoile (que ces derniers constituent) avec des lueurs scintillantes attirant auprès d’elle des esprits assoiffés (que nous étions) brille pour toujours pour gouter enfin aux fruits qu’ils ont longtemps attendus.

Cette âme assoiffée loin d’être bornée continue toujours sa course. Des mains des « intwari  » le voilà chez les dionysiens de Vincennes. J’ai fleuri dans les mains d’une équipe collégiale de Vincennes à Saint-Denis. Zaraya, Ohayon, Philippe Pomédio, Relier, Hélène Cardy, Délatte, Regottaz, Audrey Lefèvre, Christian Pradié, Gérard Dubois, Loiseau, et al. Le dream team parce qu’il est le premier à me pousser d’aller au-delà de moi-même. Une tentative risquée mais une tentative qui a payé malgré les péripéties anodines inhérentes à la vie d’un terrien qui se respecte. Que leurs efforts leur gratifient honneur qu’ils méritent, ils se donnent jours et nuit pour une cause

Pour ne pas oublier ces êtres chers agissants hors ces institutions ci hautes citées mais avec des actions qui m’ont sauvé la vie entre autre Lucien, Françoise de Chezelle de l’aumônerie de Paris8 (CISED), André Dji et Odon de CHE93, Clarine et Marie Line de la Cellule Handicap de Paris8, Valence et Mario d’Animafac et enfin Delphine, Didier et la famille Bigirimana Anselme.
Les remerciements c’est le minimum que je puisse rendre à tous ces personnages auquel je m’attache et auquel je dois mes acquis et beaucoup de respect. Cet ouvrage leur est dédié.
 
A ma famille. Je termine sur elle non pas parce qu’elle vient en dernier mais pour que sa dédicace, soit la plus marquante dans la mémoire du lecteur, avec ces lueurs rimant pour aiguiser la lime ouvrant les portes de la perception du lecteur. Les textes qui suivent nécessitent un aiguisement de la perception ;


A Gervais mon père qui m’as eu par pur hasard.
« Je le dis parce qu’à ce que je sache ou techniquement à cette époque on ne décidait pas de la nature du nouveau né, dans le cas contraire qui hésiterait devant le choix de mettre au monde un type genre Einstein ! »
Mais quel hasard alors que je devais accomplir ce
Destin d’antan, qui lui hante depuis des années.
Est-ce une malchance naître dans un milieu où on ne peut exercer son talent ? L’âge, la nature, le temps, les catastrophes rodent mais, il résiste : le destin. J’ai pris la relève de cette quête. J’irai là où t’aurais souhaité arrivé à ce moment tu y seras. Cet héritage qui n’est pas celles des familles du Texas qui se transmet sans gage de sécurité ni de survie, sans gage nécessitant la garantie pris en charge par des vies qui périssent pour assurer la survie de la famille texan…oh père que puis-je faire ? Que puis-je faire pour te montre combien je m’attache à ces valeurs qui sont les tiens depuis Aloys et sa lignée.
Et Régine je sais combien Elisabeth se réjouisse jour après jour. Là je serais d’accord avec ces mots qui nous trompent. C’est vrai que cette maxime « kwibyara bitera umubyeyi kwishima  » vu d’Elisabeth est affirmatif sans hésitation. Mais que saurais-je dire de mon appréciation ? Évidement l’appréciation que je n’oserai pas quantifier faute de la réduire au néant. Mais il faut que je l’exprime sinon je la nierai. Quelle fortune d’avoir une mère comme toi. Pour éviter une témérité langagière je me contente de te remercier et de dire que ma gloire sera la tienne tant que je suis sous le règne de Zeus, même chez Hadès je dirai que tu as vécu. Ta sève coulera dans mes veines aussi longtemps que …
Père, mère de votre fontaine j’ai puisé la sagesse parce qu’il n’y a que ça qui puisse en jaillir. De vos artères j’ai senti la vie de vos veine j’ai communié avec cette étoile flamboyante. Ce flambeau je le garderai jalousement, je le protégerai éternellement. J’irai au dessus du château d’eau de l’humanité. De l’Himalaya j’éclairerai tout les coins faisant appel à ma fortune. Cette fortune immense inépuisable auquel tout terrien a droit : la vie. Mais la vie sans peur. La peur est un vice. La vie vicieuse ne vaut pas la peine d’être vécu. Mais votre quête vaut la peine d’être soigner et relayer et donc d’être vecu.

Diane la fille ainée de Gervais et Régine future doctoresse qui coiffe bien le chapeau de médecin avec son cœur très altruiste au-delà de la norme. Tu es dans ta peau. Une terrienne affirmée sans doute. Ta douceur m’inculquât la tendresse de la vie et je sentis combien la Terre était douce. Tu m’appris à rendre tendre les égratignures de la vie. Pierre poli, je suis devenu, polissant au pilepoil transformant les politiques de chasse en politique d’accueil, politique de déperdition en politique de création et de reconquête de soi.

Segond mille mots pour te décrire et te remercier mais aucun mots à t’adresser par manque de certitude et de justesse sur les mots à t’adresser. Ton attachement aux mots, auquel je dois beaucoup je ne peux que te souhaiter qu’il produise le meilleur de toi. Cet ouvrage spécialement inspiré de nos conversations édifiantes je te la dédie. Il y a environ autant de toi que de moi mais bien sûr que l’empreinte est indélébile.

Enfin Nadia l’érudit prématurée parce qu’elle a brodé le talent du compound de la machine à penser et l’a fait la sienne si tôt. Ce que je peux te dire c’est que le meilleur de toi est à venir, très bientôt.

« A tout seigneur tout honneur me voici un terrien acharné écorchant la chaire pour en déduire la cire cirant la terre tendre qui m’a tendu la main pour y laisser mon empreinte en cire et non en épines. On est tous des terriens, la terre nous tend la main douce pourquoi lui tendre les épines ? »
Alain-Patience, 2007
 
===AVANT PROPOS===

Qu’est ce qui fait qu’on arrive à écrire un bouquin ? A quoi ressemble un écrivain de vingt ans ? Et tant d’autres questions giclent des têtes de beaucoup de personnes.

Les Héritiers de la Peur comme vous avez pu le constater n’est pas le fruit du hasard. Ici je ne parlerai pas du hasard lequel je me réserve sur des explications et l’existence d’ailleurs. Je saisis les mots au vol. Pomper ou pas ? A vous de voir ! Mais j’ai peur que dans les jours à venir la moitié de mots de notre tendre univers, légué par Molière, qu’est la langue sera breveté donc d’usage limité. Alors autant en profiter tant qu’on y a encore droit.

On ne finit pas de déposer des brevets pour des plantes naturelles. Remplacer des poissons naturels par des poissons prédateurs (perche du Nil) là c’est encore mieux. Pire des millions de morts paie des milliers de carats servant au luxe impériale des dinosaures, tant de millions de morts à cause da la famine alors que la production mondiale suffit pour 12 milliards de terriens, des essaies de médicament aux pauvres enfants qui n’en auront cure.

Des inestimables terres concédées pour mil ans aux anglais sans agios ni frais supplémentaire, des poissons qui vaut des millions, des embarcations de fortunes qui coulent durant tout l’été, ces roseaux qui se vendent sur internet sans espoir, recherche forcé des âmes sœurs, quel âme sœur ? Ces roseaux le sauront bientôt quand elles seront déboutées sur le marché par des meilleures produits que sont les caucasiques l’actuel diamant de ce marché les règles du marché oblige, non de la jungle.

Des gouvernements qui ne pensent plus par eux même, des présidents qui ont perdu la mémoire, ces fous qui nous gouvernent, ces dinosaures aux esprits décalé dans le temps, ces pays qui n’assument pas leurs responsabilités, ces dirigeants qui attendent qu’on leur raconte ce qu’ils ont fait ce qui fait qu’au final ils n’attendent que les inspecteur pour travailler enfin vous ne vous en doutez pas, ces gens on les appelle les mercenaires pour ne pas dire les charmants guignols de PPDA .

Combien translucide sont-ils ces ficelles (qui guident ces clowns lourds comme des éléphants ce qui fait à terme quand leur charge devient excessive on les descend c’est la règle de cet univers dans l’univers) pour ne pas être imperceptible par 600  millions de personnes. Ils sont visibles, moi je le vois et toi ?

Au regard de cette liste loin d’être exhaustive que veux-tu que je fasse ? Si certains de ces cas sont imperceptible je les vois tous. Le minimum que je puisse faire c’est de les mettre en exergue. Les faire connaître à ceux qui ne les connaissent pas, rendre hommage à ceux qui en sont les victimes enfin alerter ceux qui peuvent faire des choses avec mon alerte alarmant.

Enfin, « ibuye ryagaragaye nti riba rikishe isuka  ». On va larguer les amarres, un les amarres dont constitue ces ficelles nous rendant des guignols à vie deux les amarres qui nous enchaîne nous endormant par la force. On a le droit de connaître à quoi ressemblent les larges de cet océan qu’on nous a toujours leurré de loin. La réponse est au prævia bientôt sonnera l’heure de son accouchement.


D’autre part que t’aie dix vingt trente ans peu importe l’âge. La valeur n’attend pas le nombre d’année. Conscient de cette situation citée ci haut plus question d’âge, plus question de subordination heureusement qu’à vingt ans on peut se targuer d’être plus ou moins vierge de ces moult maillons céleste contaminé jusqu’au cul.

Il ne suffit pas d’avoir vingt ans pour se targuer de n’avoir pas d’appartenance endiguant. Il faut aussi être en dehors de ces microcosmes dans le macrocosme pour avoir des flux d’information de tous les côtés. Je ne suis pas un héritier de la peur ni héritier de trophées de guerres. Je suis un terrien. Je suis un passant.

Un terrien, passant, avisé agneau lassé des actions des dinosaures fatigués qui ne pensent plus au-delà de leurs nez. Ces dinosaures qui ont vécu parce qu’à mon avis ils n’existent plus. Ils sont dans un autre monde. Ce qui fait que leurs actions ne vont plus dans la même voie que ce qu’a besoin l’Afrique au 21ème siècle. Il ne faut pas trop demander ils font ce qu’ils peuvent. Comme ils ne peuvent rien autant laissé la place aux agneaux. Ils arrivent.
 
==INTRODUCTION==

Les artistes demandent leur talent et versifient leurs paroles pour parler de cette chose. Les politiciens eux c’est leurs boulots sauf que cette chose est indescriptible de leur égard. Des catastrophes se produisent et des explications ne manquent pas mais personnes n’abordent pas cette chose : la peur. Ils ont peur.

La peur est un vice. Nous vivons toujours avec cette peur qui nous hante. Nous menons une vie vicieuse. De père en fils, de génération en génération la peur se transmet et fait office. De hautes instances au fin fond du village personne ne s’en débarrasse parce qu’ils n’ont pas conscience de son existence. Il cherche des solutions ailleurs et évidement les solutions qui résolvent rien parce que non approprié au problème : la peur.

Hérité, la machine à remonter le temps ne me donne pas le début de cet héritage. Mais l’équation n’est pas irrésoluble faute de manque du point de départ. Les données existantes sont suffisantes pour permettre la mise en équation pour s’atteler à ce maillon principale. La peur cette vice qui brouillât les économistes faute de preuves et d’explications qualifiant la situation de cercle vicieux pour la simplifier tout simplement. Mais le cercle n’est pas vicieux. Dans le cercle il y a un vice.

Qui a bu boira. Au niveau mondial on avait trouvé un bouc émissaire. Personne d’autres n’était responsable ou source de maux sauf lui : l’Afrique. Candidat unique en lisse pour égoutter toutes les calamités du monde. Il en a assuré la présidence depuis. Ce continent sans responsable. Quel malheur ! Jusque là oui, au-delà non ! S’il n’y avait pas de responsable j’ignore pourquoi. Mais ces âmes innocentes au cœur tendre et doux assimilé à la naïveté, la naïveté caractère dont ils sont loin de refléter ont enfin un protecteur contre les prédateurs.

Ces prédateurs bien sûr viennent étant coiffé de casques différents. Ils ne viennent pas avec la marque de prédateurs. Soit le prédateur prend son origine à l’intérieur des victimes : des vendus ; soit le prédateur est un moine qui prédique les 35H à l’église et laisse les brebis écoper les conséquences de ces déboires enfin lui autant d’heure passé sur les podiums lui vaut la montée dans les échelons des millionnaires au Texas.

Enfin les pires prédateurs eux ils ne cachent même pas leurs intentions. Obstinément depuis la conférence de Berlin (1884-5) ils se croient les garants, les responsables, … les rédempteurs de ce vrai vieux continent en réalités se sont des vrais prédateurs.

Que faire ? Tout se passe dans la tête. L’argent ne résout rien. Il faut les têtes bien faites. L’exploitation de nos valeurs. Les nouveaux concepts les nôtres à l’instar : l’action sans appel au don. Ces dons qui nous ont mis au ban et croulé au sol. Il est temps de nous lever. On n’a rien à rattraper, que des choses à faire. Il y a mille façon de faire tout le monde choisira le sien. Tous les moyens ne sont pas bons pour y arriver ; ces mots qui ont duré alors qu’ils ne sont pas automatiquement vrais et transposable sont à séquestrer ou mettre à la poubelle.
 
==La peur==

Au commencement

Les Parents assurent les premiers jours de l’enfant. C’est clair, normal …au cas où les ils en ont les possibilités. Mais je ne vois pas les raisons d’en arriver là (mettre au monde les enfants) sans en avoir les moyens.

Vous pouvez vous posez un tas de questions pourquoi ou comment est ce possible ? Au passage je prends un couple inexistant ou presque parce que sa durée de vie est environ zéro jours. Au départ l’homme est un animal. Son atout, sauf que des fois j’ai du mal à l’avoué vu les débauches qu’il se permet ces jours ci, est qu’il pense s’adapte, pense et j’en passe milles éloges. Notre fameux couple dans sa durée va dans un coin sous un pont, dans la brousse, dans des voitures, etc. et font leur boulot dans quelque minute le couple n’existera plus.

Ne me demande pas les conditions dans lesquelles s’est déroulé ce moment où nous sommes tous venu sauf les nouveaux descendants des éprouvettes (papa éprouvette). Et que dire s’ils savent que à la limite que le plus dangereux des conséquences (syndrome, d’intelligence déficiente, acquis) existe. 

Avec l’évolution productive, la femme ou fille mère lui-même ne se suffit pas. Du jour au lendemain il ne résout pas ses soucis de santé, de nourritures bref d’une vie descente et le résultat est la peur de joindre deux bouts de la journée, ce n’est plus deux bouts du mois. Ceux qui pensent à joindre deux bout du mois sont les soit disant  fonctionnaires.

Eux aussi n’échappent pas à cette règle qui fait la loi. Mal nourrit du lundi au dimanche. Les conditions de travail pas évidents : trac d’être licencié tôt ou tard car le créneau a été gagné dans les conditions non légales pour le garder il faut des sacrifices qui deviennent de plus en plus insupportables faute de quoi on te remplace par un bon prestataire de pot de vin.

La limite est pire. Au cas où le gagneur de pain cède au pas du plus fort, qui à son tour va rogner sur les moins nantit ou moins avisé et le système s’implante pour s’éterniser. Ainsi est conçu le système dont la présentation ci haute est l’iceberg. Le pire est au fond. Ça c’est connu. On en fait quoi ?

Je viens d’arriver. Ce qui est le plus désolant c’est cet enfant qui débarque dans l’une des situations ci hautes citées sans part de responsabilité. Des fois on hérite des fortunes, des situations, des circonstances mais ces deux là ne méritent pas d’être reléguer, autant s’abstenir sinon on est responsable. Autant s’abstenir sinon on est cruel. Autant mettre fin au système tant qu’on y est impliqué sinon on est assassin comme les autres.

Quel éducation veux tu qu’aie cet enfant. Quel valeur veux tu qu’aie cet enfant. Quel vie veux tu donner à cet enfant même sa mère ne s’y est consacré nul seconde. Quel feedback attends-tu de lui. Est-ce que tu le sais ? Et alors. Il ne connait pas les spéculations de Wall Street, il ne veut pas attendre parler du trou dans l’ozone, il s’en fou de la mondialisation. Il ne connait pas Napoléon, il ne connait pas Jésus ou Bouddha, il ne connait pas le Zen, il ne connait pas le AK 47. Il est né dans un égout. Il ne connait pas l’amour. Il ne connait presque pas la vie. Lui-même il est la peur incarnée. Il ne connait pas la peur parce qu’il est la peur. Il veut vivre. Reconquérir sa vie.

La peur est une vice.

On n’a rien à rattraper, que des choses à faire. Tout nait quand les dirigeants de ces pays ont peur de rattraper les autres. Ils disent il faut faire comme les autres. Privilégier comme les études dans les sciences dures. L’objectif est de se rattraper en technologie. Le résultat est clair et net. Bien sûr qu’il y a des têtes qui en sort vaillamment. Mais le gros du partisont des têtes abrutit, engloutit dans ce peloton où ils ne sortiront que sous la volonté du descendant ou héritier du moine de couleur (le plus offrant : d’où le début du carnage. On en fait ce qu’on veut, parce qu’on a acheté les droits d’exploitation. Tu n’appartiens plus à toi-même). La peur règne. L’âme est pourrie. Le tube digestif commence son boulot.

Il ne peut pas y avoir de productivité parce que les gens font ce qu’ils ne savent pas, les gens ont peur parce qu’ils ne maitrisent pas la machine. Ils sont prêts à céder à n’importe quoi.
 
La peur

Tu les vits, tu l’acceptes (à moins que tu nies ce que tu ignores)
 
La peur

Les hommes et la peur

La peur endort les gens. On a peur donc on est endormi. L’heure de réveil a sonné.
 
La peur (tous les ingrédients réunis)

La peur, la faim, la corruption, les guerres, quel est le prochain vice ?

Quand tout le continent devient peureux … ça produit une bombe inratable. 
 
La peur

L’équation de la peur.
-	Ceux qui sont arrivés (pour dire toute forme ou endroit de séparation avec une autre partie jugé bas) ont peur d’être déposséder.
-	Ceux qui ne sont pas encore arrivés rêve sans cesse d’y arriver par tous les moyens (y compris les embarcations de fortunes)
-	Entre les deux il y a un antagonisme.

La résultante des rapports de force des relations pareilles donnent …

Si les portes de la perception , en référence au roman portant ce titre, était ouvert les choses nous apparaîtraient telles qu’elles sont. Ces portes sont obstruées par les maux ci hauts cités. Tu peux faire semblant de les ignorer mais ils te traquent.



Si j’avais écris cet ouvrage avec peur j’aurais eu beaucoup de retenu. Mais j’ai tout craché sans peur comme vous allez le constater lettre après lettre, mots après mots, page après page, chapitre après chapitre, enfin viendra bouquin après bouquin. La peur garanti la rétention.
 
==L’héritage de la peur==

On réfléchit en tant qu’individu même là où il nous faut nous mettre ensemble. Pour résoudre un problème il faut penser individuellement mais aussi en tant un tout ceci dit on n’existe pas en dehors de ce tout : la preuve est que l’Afrique n’existe pas sur ce point parce que le divided et impera a bien marché (le divided et impera est une bonne invention de l’humanité mais dans le cas où il est utilisé pour le bien être de l’être humain. D’ailleurs le divided et impera est une théorie scientifique …


 
L’héritage

De père en fils : l’héritage
 
L’héritage (produit)

Nos richesses nous tuent plus qu’ils nous nourrissent 
 
L’héritage (comportement)

Manque de courage (si j’ose dire, ouvrir la bouche on me descend : la peur, la peur, la peur…mon Dieu la peur.
 
Héritage (encore cet héritage)

Quand les richesses se transforment en malédiction et pauvretés etc.

 
L’héritage de la peur

Les héritiers de la Peur.

Cette peur qui nous mine sans mine pour nous mener à la manne manier par le moine (missionnaire) au départ, le militaire, le marchand enfin le millionnaire.

Cet enfant depuis la conception la mère n’était sur de la mettre au monde fautes de conditions dans les quelles l’enfant encore fœtale évolue. Au monde l’enfant en plus des hormones reçu dans le bain amniotique de la mère peureuse, la mère se bat jour pour jour avec la peur de trouver un boulot ou le perdre quand elle l’a.
 
==Afrique égout de toutes les misères du monde==

Dans l’égout (besoin)

On a besoin de quoi quand on vit en Afrique ?

 
Dans l’égout (droit)

On a droit à quoi quand on vit en Afrique ?
 
Second hand vs. second life.

Second life virtuel, réaliste dans ces actes, menteur dans ces promesses. Mais on ment l’ignorant. Second hand irréaliste dans ces actes respects ressemblant à la naïveté 

 
Dans l’égout (état des lieux)

On en parle 

Ce système qui n’est pas conçu pour nous accueillir même chez nous :
-	Ces hôtels dans lesquels on n’a pas accès parce que leurs tarifs sont loin de refléter nos moyens ;
-	Import/export on ne réagit plus (cultive plus pour nous). On cultive pour eux (les autres).
-	Plus de culture viagère (de consommation)

Keynes dont le système économique interventionniste hérite une marge importante n’a pas prévu l’interventionnisme au niveau planétaire. L’état providence se limite au niveau de la nation au delà on perle de l’état braqueur, conquérant,…
 
« Le bouc émissaire »

Les parcs d’attractions ont toujours existé. L’équilibre dont on maitrise les lois en physique semble non transposable  dans le sociale dans toutes les civilisations. Les conflits, la faim, les maladies et tous les maux africains assurent la paix d’ailleurs. Il n’y a pas que l’Afrique mais il réunit le gros poids sur le levier assurant le maintient du reste aux anges.

 
==Les saviez-vous ?==

Le changement de l’heure c’était économique
 
Les saviez-vous ?

La nationalisation des compagnies des pays arabes ont provoqué la crise pétrolière des années 70.g
 
Le saviez-vous ? (suite)

On te prive de ta liberté jusqu’au point où tu as l’impression que tu as tort quand tu jouis de ta liberté le plus absolu, inaliénable.
 
Le saviez-vous ?

De mains des européens vers les mains des chinois …après à qui viendra le tour ? Enfin quand est ce que nous nous tiendrons dans nos propres mains ?


De ce troc les africains ne restent pas indemne. Les occidentaux nous ont laissé ces poissons qui valent des millions : perche du Nil, des concessions pour des millénaires (territoire des Massaï acquise par les anglais pour mil ans), etc.

 
Le saviez-vous ?

La vérité tout craché (la condition humaine pas de André Malraux mais la version de Mizero) : les restos du cœur, CMU, carte de solidarité transport…


Pourquoi les africains se haïssent entre eux ici en France ?
-	L’un craint que l’autre le dénonce
-	L’un craint que l’autre dise la vérité
-	L’un craint que l’autre lui pique ses avantages (ses miettes). Des miettes parce que vous n’êtes pas des ayant droits de ce soi disant paradis qui vous a leurré pour venir. Et c’est vrai parce que les français ont travaillés pour des siècles et des siècles pour en arriver là.


Un jour un collègue à moi m’a dit : Tu sais Alain, tu es là pour nous tous, pas que pour toi et ta famille. Tu sais ce que tu dois faire ? J’ai dit oui mais ce ne pas à toi de me le dire. Il a dit arrête de déconner. Je vais te dire un truc. Cherche des contacts. Si tu tombes amoureux tombes dans les mains d’une bourge. Cherche à te faire connaître auprès des seniors, flattes-les. S’ils meurent tu hériteras de leurs fortunes comme si je détiens le compte à rebours de la mort de quelqu’un. En matière d’amour (ci haut) là c’a toujours été pareille. Mais là j’ai une autre solution. Ce n’est pas mon genre, je l’ai répondu catégoriquement. Mais sur tout son questionnement je n’y réponds pas parce que je ne suis pas entrain de faire de la confession intime mais je montre la vérité tout craché. 

 
Les saviez-vous ?

L’échelle de droit à la nature. La mobilité dépend des moyens dont on dispose pour se payer des trajets qu’elle exige.
Bref la jouissance des bienfaits de la nature dépend de combien tu gagnes. Ça c’est encore mieux. Parce qu’au pire ça dépend de combien tu arnaques, voles… combien de personne affamés, tués j’en passe d’autres éventualités pour enfin se payer une visite dorée.
 
==Comment en est on arrivé là ?==

Quand les gens ne pensent plus par eux même. Ils louent le cerveau avisé ou le cerveau se propose porteur de rédemption, promesse et avenir.



Il y a les parents qui se permettent de mettre au monde les gosses alors qu’ils ne sont pas encore armés pour une telle bataille. Il ne suffit pas de mettre au monde. Il faut préparer la responsabilité qui suit la naissance de l’enfant : l’éducation. L’éducation est un processus. Fautes de quoi on risque de produire des racailles.

Ne vous prenez pas à ce mot. Je veux juste faire l’écho du jargon du président de la République française en exercice avec sa machine producteur de racaille artificiel (artefact). Artefact parce que c’est une production qui fait sa force de propagande métier dont il est expert. On vous l’appelle (racaille) et vous l’acceptez ! On ne nait pas racaille, on le devient. On le devient activement ou passivement


Pourquoi les gens ont peur des examens alors l’examen devait être un lieu d’épanouissement où tu manifestes ton ingéniosité.
 
Comment en est on arrivé là ? En Afrique

Les garants : garant pour louer une chambre, garant ou gage pour avoir un crédit,…et le garant pour la nation ? (nations, multinationales). C’est toi : Afrique. Et si tu te garantissais pour qu’ils se garantissent à leur tour eux même.
 
Comment en est on arrivé là ? (en France)

Les tubes digestifs contre les bourges (je ne manifeste  aucune haine contre les bourges)

Et ce paradis dont on prêche jour et nuit 35H par jour. Vous vous rendez compte ? Si vous on vous révélez qu’il est là au Vatican ! Oh, la vache ? Les prix ! N’importe quoi ? Tu parle. Je suis prêt à faire tout et n’importe quoi pour y aller : le début de l’acharnement. Sans exception à partir du président tout le monde usant sa place et ses prérogatives jusqu’à mettre en gage les citoyens pour se payer le ticket au paradis pourquoi pas un château au Touquet ou en Bretagne. Au Vatican c’est trop religieux il faut se pointer chaque matin pour bénéficier la bénédiction du Pape mais entre temps il contrôle les présences et tu peux te voir refuser le renouvellement du titre de séjour ou au pire être reconduit à la frontière. Le pauvre. Eh ben…

Dès que quelqu’un arrive à un avancé, il se croit le maître du monde et il ne pense pas aux autres. C’est ça le défaut, le péché originel (eternel). Il veut fructifier en volant, commercialisant sous prétexte de pérenniser et protéger. Pire encore il ne veut pas que les autres sachent comment ça fonctionne.

Quand on croit détenir on ne pense plus. D’ailleurs c’est le péché criminel que l’Eglise a commis. L’Homme devient ignorant quand le système qu’il a lui-même crée lui dépasse en terme de gestion. Les tragédies se succèdent. Les solutions ou les raccourcis ne sont plus cachés et sont pléthores. L’incendie soit pour enterrer le dossier qui est devenu ingérable. Les disparitions forcées des taupes ou des personnes qui risquent de divulguer les anguilles sous la roche, etc.

Si c’était un blanc qui l’aurait écrit, il aurait été attaqué en justice par la CRAN  et peut être emprisonné avec chef d’accusation : racisme.


Je sais pourquoi !
Vous parlez et on vous dit que vous êtes communautaristes. Mais moi je vous dis parler, fait parler de vous, parler entre vous, saluez vous il n’y a personne d’autre pour vous le faire. Mais que ce qui vous arrive ? Mince alors ! Regardez ces blancs qui sont chez nous, ils se connaissent tous, ils se parlent tous.

Mais je ne vous en veux pas parce qu’il y a ceux qui sont arrivé ayant volé, ayant tué des âmes pour avoir le ticket,…et bien d’autres conneries et vous avez raison d’avoir peur dans ce cas. Je dis ceux qui n’ont pas de souillures osez parler à vos semblables et autres au même niveau. Ayez moins de dédain. Sinon le carnassier aura atteint son objectif. Si vous ne vous parlez pas comment voulez vous être capable d’autre chose assurément nécessitant d’avantage d’effort. Fait un effort.
 
Comment en est-on arrivé là ?

Tout au début, le début qu’on a gardé les traces avec la civilisation écrite, c’est avec l’arrivée de l’homme blanc. Cet homme a débarqué il y a tout simplement longtemps. Pour ne pas me perdre comme ces logiciens qui s’attardent sur des petits faits alors qu’il y a de sérieux problèmes sur les quels on devrait se pencher et en plus je ne donne pas des leçons d’histoire (voir page explication de l’histoire). Ce monsieur on nous présente pléthore raison de sa descente vers ce monde devenu l’enfer vert. Vert parce que l’enfer caricaturé jusqu’aujourd’hui nous était donné en noir. Vert encore grâce à ces forêts filtre notre source de vie : l’air respirable. Mais entre temps je lance l’appel aux descendants d’Einstein d’ajouter sur leur agenda les recherches sur la production de l’air respirable parce qui bientôt on en aura guère.

On avait une civilisation ça ce n’est pas discutable. Même si les socialistes pas le PS (parti socialiste) pas Durkheim, Auguste Compte disait qu’une société sans écriture est une société a-histoire. C’était une vérité comme tant d’autre qui ont existé et fait l’unanimité avant d’être réfuter après. Maintenant qu’on est d’accord sur ‘existence de la civilisation qui était le notre voilà ce qui s’est passé.

On est d’accord qu’on ne peut vivre sans faire l’effort de vivre pour ne pas dire travailler. On travaillait mais j’ignore dans quelles conditions ? Quel genre de travail ? Quels métiers ? Etc. J’ai appris qu’il faisait la cueillette, ils étaient des nomades jusqu’à une époque récente. Mais qu’il a existé un royaume appelé Egypte (l’Égypte antique) après hop plus d’autres choses intéressantes sur l’Afrique à part les royaumes de Songhaï, Mali, Dahomey, etc. redécouvert  après leur longue existence.

Par contre qu’il a existé  cet empire qui s’appelle Empire grecque), Empire romaine, Empire de Charlemagne, etc. Que les européens je vous rappelle descendants de vandales, wisigoths, ostrogoths, burgondes, francs, alains, etc. n’ont jamais était des nomades, jamais cueillis, etc. mais des conquérants éternels jusqu’eau 21ème siècle. Alors comme il a toujours fait l’héritier de Attila en arrivant en Afrique

La négligence des dirigeants africains assurent les richesses des autres. C’est la négligence ou l’ignorance ou la peur ?

Vous savez : quand on se trahit on dit que les autres nous ont trahis. Les africains sont responsables de cette galère. Je démontre ma théorie sans logique parce que la logique n’est pas tout à fait vraie et ce qui est vrai n’est pas réel, ce qui veut dire que ma théorie est réelle sans être vraie. L’exemple d’auto trahison : tu peux mettre ta confiance en quelqu’un(e) plus tard tu lui proposes en mariage s’il (elle) te refuse tu diras qu’il (elle) t’a déçu(e). C’est absurde cette conclusion parce que toute personne est libre de décider en ce qui la concerne. Donc c’est toi la source du désarroi.



On pompe tous. Mais il y a pomper et pomper. On pompe pour plusieurs raisons. Pomper c’est une caractéristique des être humains. Dans le cas contraire ça serait regrettable. C’est même impensable.

Mais le pompage dont je vais vous parlez et déguelasse. Synonyme d’abroutissement, d’incapacité, de lâcheté, naïveté, bref l’une des maillons fortes de la chaine, enchainant ces âmes serviles servant ces cervelles vide vacant manquant de matière grise digne, bref bon pour être la proie des âmes avisés, bon pour le carnage s’il le faut faute de manque d’autres options pour répondre aux cas costaux.

Ils ont toujours cru aux mirages quand la réalité se pointe en face ils disent on nous a ensorcelé ou on veut nous descendre, tout simplement parce qu’ils sont arrivé là dans des conditions illégales (ne leur permettant pas ou leur garantissant un tel statut qui n’est pas du tout simple). Ils n’assument pas ils assomment. Ils n’affrontent pas ils s’affolent. 

Pourquoi les gens ont peurs des examens ? Alors que les examens devaient être des lieux d’épanouissement. C’est parce qu’ils ont peur. Et c’est parce que c’est cette éducation qu’ils reçu. A la limite ils ne sont pas dans leur peau.

Conséquence, ils n’existent pas. Ils sont morts. Alors ne leur demander pas d’avantage parce qu’ils ne sont capable de rien, pitié. Ils y vont les yeux bandés. Quand ils s’aperçoivent de la réalité ils se construisent un bouclier mythique qui risque de faire du carnage.

Quand on te dit que tu ne peux rien faire et que tu le crois (acceptes) tu as tort et peur. Quand dire devient faire ? C’est quand le moine te dit qu’en dehors de la bible il n’y a rien et que tu es terrifié par ça. Je te dis Le Bon Dieu travaillait, il travaille et il travaillera. En plus les pharisiens lui ont reproché de travaillé le jour du sabbat. Si tu travaille tu Le loue, si tu glandes Il est mécontent, bien sûr qu’il y a travailler et travailler. Pense avant d’agir beaucoup d’ennui te seront épargnés. Pense à toi et aux autres.

La vie	

La vie est l’une des éléments de la nature comme la mort, la résurrection (pour ceux qui y croit), la réincarnation (pour ceux qui y croit). La vie dont il est question dans ce texte est la vie d’ici bas  (sur terre). Selon l’état de conscience ou d’éveil de l’esprit on a une certaine image de la vie.

Mais il y a une réalité « nous sommes des êtres vivants » ici je ne parlerais pas des êtres vivants qui sont des animaux qui sont des êtres vivants mais qui ne sont pas des humains ; si je dis homme je ne fais pas allusions à l’intelligence mais à la race humaine, terme qui est dans la plupart des cas utilisés par les racistes remplaçant le terme ethnie par race ce qui est une erreur.

Nous vivons et nous sommes hébergés par la nature. « Errare humanum est » ça veux dire l’erreur est humaine mais ce n’est pas parce que l’erreur est humaine que nous devons nous autodétruire (par des exploitations de certains matières de la nature qui nous cause des malheurs ou qui nous conduit à notre autodestruction).

Tu ne peux pas être heureux  alors que ton prochain n’est pas heureux Eric Dacheux, Communication politique européenne. C’est vrai pour vivre il faut travailler. Je suis sûr qu’on peut avoir à faire sans pour autant abuser la nature avec la recherche des intérêts il suffit d’avoir des cerveaux (matières grises).

La vie ne vaut rien mais rien ne vaut la vie disait un Chanteur dont le nom m’échappe. J’écris ce texte qui risque de devenir un livre si j’ai le temps pour tout le monde et surtout pour les gens qui investissent sur vie au lieu d’investir dans la vie. Je m’explique investir sur la vie c’est l’obsession de se soucier de ses intérêt personnel au détriment des autres. Le contraire c’est juste de se soucier à la vie en soit  « sur la vie ça montre déjà que cette vie dans laquelle on s’investit est uniquement personnelle alors que dans la vie  ça sous entend la vie collective.

Se rendre compte de l’essence de la vie  c’est très simple, il suffit de s’imagier depuis votre naissance. Je ne suis pas ici pour mettre le cours de biologie mais il faut que je le redise. On naît après neuf mois dans le ventre de la mère et après des étapes de croissances en psychologie : l’étape de prononcer un premier mot, premier pas etc. Et après on devient une personne avec une personnalité personnelle.

Il était un fois un congolais militant d’un syndicat contre le régime  de Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku N’gbendu Wazabanga. Son activisme lui a valu à la fin un handicap d’où commence mon petite histoire dont je veux vous raconter. Je préfère continuer avec mon personnage anonyme mais avec une histoire vraie. Un militant du temps du régime de Mobutu était un homme des idées qui aime la vie et qui vit sa vie. Comme vivre sa vie ça inquiète les gens sa vision des choses n’allait pas durer longtemps avec ceux qui ne partagent pas avec lui cette vision. Avec l’étoile qui éclaire et montre à celui qui veut suivre le bon chemin lui a donné une voie d’aller en France. Dès son arrivée en France il n’avait jamais cessé d’être en contact avec sa famille. Ce contact avec les transferts de minerval après il a fini par amener sa famille dans la renardière en France. Après un bout de temps sa famille (femme et enfant) qui eux aussi ne partage pas les mêmes idées comme ce malheureux Monsieur (mais paraît il que pour lui il sent de  la réalisation de soi dans ce que les autres considères comme le drame) caractère normale des gens qui vivent leur vie mais qui ne gagne pas leur vie. Enfin la famille qui a été en France grâce ce Monsieur (en plus handicapé) c’est en 2007 que sa famille lui dit tu ne fait rien tu n’a que à aller chercher ailleurs où vivre et quoi faire ; propos tenu par sa femme et ses enfants. Imagine vous ce drame.

Cette personnalité n’est pas le fruit du hasard. D’ailleurs le hasard n’existe pas, le tout arrive selon qu’on est prêt à l’accueillir (Pasteur on l’a dit c’est par hasard que tu as découvert le vaccin de [    ] et il a dit même le hasard n’arrive qu’on esprit préparés.

Quand on vit sa vie et on quand on parvient à se structurer on forme une belle famille, un beau commune, un bon département une belle nation ainsi de suite. Actuellement j’ai du mal à concevoir mes idées à cause de l’époque qui se dit non affilié à aucune religion (laïcité). Mais qu’on soit dans une société qui se déclare laïque ou pas se sont des idées universelles valables quelque soit le système (laïque ou non).

Scientifiquement et simplement on est capable de s’apercevoir certains phénomènes basiques de la terre (et de la vie) les traiter, les comprendre. En médecine on est capable de guérir beaucoup de maladie, en chimie on fabrique des produit ressemblant aux données naturelles, en physique on est capable d’aller sur la lune la liste des sciences avec tout ce qu’ils sont capables de réaliser aujourd’hui est long ce qu’on peut signaler c’est qu’aucune de ces sciences n’est parvenu à tout ce qu’il est capable de réaliser sans l’intervention d’une autre science. Ce qui me permet de dire que la science est unique et universelle. Ce qu’on peut dire à propos des différentiations c’est qu’il y a des applications des sciences par exemple sur la santé c’est la médecine, sur la terre c’est la géographie etc.

Qu’on soit scientifique, érudit, doué ou mal appris d’après le système d’apprentissage dont on dispose pour le moment la configuration des données naturelles est un fait, une réalité et extra qu’on ne peut pas prendre le risque d’en douter. La c’est lâcher la prise si on essaie de la saisir pour s’en approprier elle nous échappe si on la laisse libre nous la vivons.

Servitude
Renversement des tendances. D’habitude le serviteur occupe une place inférieure sur l’échelle de la société. Les serviteurs mettent en pratiques les activités serviles. Les serviteurs servent les soi disant nobles.

Dans le système actuel normalement les dirigeants sont considérés comme des serviteurs. Le phénomène qui s’est produit avec la preuve des tendances actuelles est que quand on est trop dépendant du serviteur ce dernier fini par être un dirigeant effréné.

Existence

Il y a deux chose dans la vie il y a exécuté et penser. Dans la vie soit on privilégie exécuté ou penser je veux dire entreprendre. Ce que je ne sais pas encore c’est si on choisit d’être l’un ou l’autre.

Les maximes qui ont durée longtemps mais qui ne sont pas vrai.
-	« Kwibyara bitera umubyeyi kwishima » : vrai et faux. Vrai au cas où le parent n’a connu aucun autre modèle parental. Faux en général parce que tu ne peux pas me dire combien on se réjouira de mettre à bas une pute, un soulard, etc. Je sais que qu’on ne nait pas pute ou soulard. On le devient. Parce que pour que l’enfant devienne ce que son parent souhaite voir c’est ce dernier qui assume … (objet d’un ouvrage).
-	« Ibyara Mweru na Muhima ». 
-	Quand le système produit, développe en soi les éléments qui le sonde pour le corriger. 
-	Tout système porte en soi les éléments de sa propre autodestruction.
-	En swahili il y a une maxime qui dit « mutoto wa nyoka ni nyoka ». C’est vrai et c’est faux. Vrai parce que leurs nom sont peut être les même. Faux parce qu’ils n’agissent, occupent pas les même fonctions. Ce qui veut dire que rien n’est figé. La nature n’est pas méchante. C’est l’appréciation de l’homme qui la qualifie ainsi. Et en plus…Précédemment  j’ai dit personne ne viendra pas résoudre tes problèmes.

 
Les fausse religions (sciences qui trompent…)

Et la logique dans tout cela ?
Le syllogisme pour réfuter ou dissimuler les bêtises on les défend avec la logique.

Regarde-moi ce jeu de mots :
Gervais est mon père (majeur, prémisse)
Gervais est chrétien catholique (mineure, prémisse)
Et donc Alain son enfant est catholique

C’est cette conclusion que la loi de la logique donne. Et elle n’est pas vraie. Ça c’est une partie de cette science qui nous est transmises par les grecques. 


Autre exemple : Un groupe de personnes nulles. Le premier des nuls est le plus nul. C’est faux je m’explique. La logique c’est l’ignorance. Sinon c’est l’offuscation volontaire d’une réalité immense. Et pour la contrôler ou faire semblant da la contrôler on a imagine un réducteur : c’est le rôle de la logique.

Les vraies fausses religions

L’église comme les guerres nous ont ravagées. Les guerres il n’y a rien à prouver elles sont meurtrières. Et la religion ? Le gars il nous a minés sur tous les fronts. Merci à la nature, je suis né pour le dénoncer. La nature est douce, tendre et juste à temps.

« L'ÉTYMOLOGIE du terme religion reste incertaine ; elle est controversée depuis l'Antiquité.
À la suite de Lactance, de Tertullien, les auteurs chrétiens se plaisent à expliquer le latin religio par les verbes ligare, religare, lier, relier. La religion serait un lien de piété, elle aurait pour objet les relations qu'on entretient avec la divinité, elle signifierait attache ou dépendance, elle profiterait même des nuances et des variations de sens que nous obtenons, en français comme en latin, lorsque nous changeons un rattachement en attachement, un lien effectif en lien affectif.

Une autre origine est plus probable, signalée par Cicéron, appuyée de son autorité. Religio se tire de legere, cueillir, ramasser, ou de religere, recueillir, recollecter. Toutefois ce dernier verbe, attesté seulement par un participe, est une restitution. D'après Émile Benveniste, il voulait dire : revenir sur ce qu'on fait, ressaisir par la pensée ou la réflexion, redoubler d'attention et d'application. En conséquence, religion est synonyme de scrupule, de soin méticuleux, de ferveur inquiète. Dans ce sens, le mot convient éminemment à l'exercice du culte, à l'observance rituelle, qui exigent que la pratique soit littérale, le zèle soucieux et vigilant. Si religion équivaut à délicatesse de conscience, à recueillement intense, à circonspection craintive et minutieuse, on comprend que le terme se soit fixé rapidement, presque exclusivement, sur l'expérience ou la manipulation du sacré. Il ne la signifiait pas d'abord. Mais en signifiant l'attitude qu'elle requiert, il était destiné à glisser de la disposition subjective qu'il souligne aux réalités objectives que cette disposition concerne. » 

La religion étymologiquement veut dire ce qui nous lie. Alors on voit bien que ce qui est en Afrique est loin d’être une religion à cause de 2 raisons majeures : une religion imposée n’est pas une religion mais un outil de conquête au sens large du terme (aussi bien des âmes que des ressources) et une dictature douce qui lutte pour gagner le terrain et qui (ce tigre) se coiffe de soit disant de bonnes valeurs comme modules d’enseignement

J’en ai ras le bol de ces manifestations de séductions.

Un pays qui attende qu’on lui dise qu’il a bien travaillé c’est déplorable, horrible, etc. Mais tant qu’il y a des mannettes, ils ne cesseront pas de venir ces carnassiers déguisés en bienfaiteurs.

Ceci a fait une culture qui me fait ma au dos. Les dirigeants ont peur qu’en tout lieu et n’importe quel moment il peut y avoir des contrôleurs de leurs politiques. Vous vous imaginez le drame ? Ils sont tout le temps aux aguets.

Ils n’auraient pas peur s’ils auraient rempli leurs tâches comme il se doit mais c’est dur parce qu’ils ne sont pas des initiateurs des politiques dont ils sont appelés à mettre en exécutions des fois c’est à contre cœur mais ils n’osent pas le dire c’est effroyable !

S’il n’y avait pas des mannettes …J’ai assisté à moult opérations pareilles. Fait ceci, fait cela les blanc vont bientôt venir inspecter …je ne veux pas perdre mon poste …J’en ai marre !

La vraie science on ne nous a pas permis d’y avoir accès. Les vraie produit des sciences sont enterrés au MIT  (représentant bien d’autre endroits secrets). Ces vraies produits de la science sont exploités au service et profit de cet girond qui nous fait tourné en rond autour des marchés financiers qui rappellent ces lingots d’or dont j’ignore où ils ont été extraits.

On nous fait croire que les richesses est là au paradis européen qui ne l’est pas en réalité. Non, les richesses sont là en Afrique tu les foules jour et nuit mais tant qu’on te fait croire le contraire sans référence (dont est l’objet de ce bouquin) te prouvant la vérité tu ne sauras jamais cette vérité qui blessera le moine.

Comment les autres le sauront ? Avec le téléphone arabe. Le téléphone c’est le fait de transmettre le message de buche à oreille. Ça semble bizarre dans le monde actuel qu’on appelle monde de communication. En faisant référence aux nouvelles technologies de l’information et de la communication. Ce monde qui ne nous appartient pas. Ce monde qui monde qui nous tient à la traine. Cette communication qui risque de nous commuter en tube digestif de nouveaux produits électronique. C’est une voie déjà emprunter par les uns.

Il y a tel pourcentage des personnes qui utilisent internet, tel pourcentage pour radio, tel pourcentage pour presse écrite, …

Laisse-moi me fier aux sociologues même si je ne suis pas d’accord avec tout ce qu’ils disent. La culture des africains n’est pas encore adaptée ou imprégnée de cette culture de lecture tant qu’il y a un tel pourcentage des personnes ne sachant pas lire. Malgré ça en attendant qu’ils s’en rendent compte et ils se reprennent on (nous les africains ayant pris cette conscience) va utiliser ce qu’ils ont avant que l’Homme blanc qui nous a toujours dit qu’il a une avance que nous devons rattraper nous donne un autre sprint à assumer. Nous avons rien à rattraper mais des choses à faire.

Two step flow : la communication à deux niveaux. Mais il faut voir. On nous a longtemps dit que un vieux qui meurt c’est comme une bibliothèque qui se consume (Ampate Baa). Mais ce n’est pas forcement vrai. Parce qu’imaginons un clochard qui meurt, on perd cet âme mais on ne perd pas une bibliothèque.

Maintenant voyons qui mérite d’être le relais d’information dans notre maillon d’information ? On est dans un système qu’il faut comprendre pour manier et décider sur quoi faire.

C’est dommage qu’actuellement tout ou presque toutes les découvertes les aventures de la nature sont protégés par des brevets et ne profitent pas aux terriens. Après on nous inflige d’être des laxistes, naïfs et pléthores qualificatifs malsains. Les découvertes entrainent les autres. Comment voulaient-vous qu’on brûle les étapes. Merci quand même de nous avoir laissé le droit au contrôle du feu si ce n’est qu’on en ait les inventeur, au moins c’est l’honneur des …
 
Que faire (lieu d’action)

A l’intérieur ou à l’extérieur ?

Si tu te respectes on va te respecter. Si tu ne te fais pas respecter personne ne te respectera jamais. Le respect on ne l’exige pas on le mérite. Le mérite nécessite des efforts. Si tu ne t’efforces pas tu n’y arriveras jamais. Il faut oser. Il nous faut des agneaux. Dehors les béliers, dinosaures, éléphants, hippopotames rouillés, ratés, usés, corrompu, égueulés dont les gueules égrotants n’ont plus de rendements. Ils ne produisent plus les matières grises dont l’Afrique a besoin. A vos marques les agneaux. Débroussaillez ces champs devants vous ! Mettez en marche ce nouveau concept d’action sans faire appel aux dons. Faites vous respectez en vous respectant et respectant les autres y compris la nature. La nature vous gâtera comme il l’a toujours fait. Mais gâter la d’abord. Tout se passe dans la tête ; alors à vos méninges.

Ce qui est exact c’est l’ouverture d’esprit du voyageur. Voyager c’est l’esprit d’un Homme éveillé. Mais ici je parle de voyager dans le but de découvrir pas dans le but de vider les poches esprit dans l’air.

Que faire (mode d’activités)

Les petits actes ou les grands actes ?

Appliquons ce que j’ai proposé pour la résolution de cette énigme : l’héritage dont on veut se débarrasser. Il faut appliquer le divided et impera pour résoudre des problèmes par pour les générer. On met côte à côte différentes éventualités de problèmes sans dire on a des problèmes vaguement. Et je vous rappelle que sont nos problèmes il n’y a personne qui viendra les résoudre à notre place ne serait ce que nous endormir encore. On a bien dormi maintenant sonne l’heure de réveil. Au boulot 35H de travail par jour, la religion est individuelle, les examens au BAC, à la FAC l’étudiant aussi bien que l’élève doit faire preuve d’assiduité en exposant une nouveauté. Ce dernier point est crucial parce qu’il déterminera notre avenir.

Assez cette éducation dogmatique héritière de l’ambassadeur du Vatican dans le coin. On évolue. Les énoncés des éminents intellos d’antan ceux qui résistent encore sont très peu. Vous ne serez pas étonné d’entendre un enfant qui vous raconte des faits, événements qui ne sont plus en usages. Et pour dissimuler ça au fait le professeur qui assure ces cours lui aussi n’en maitrise que peut d’embranchement dans le domaine et si tu l’amène loin au point de lui éprouvé un challenge tu deviens son ennemi juré. C’est tout le problème. Le professeur il a peur de se faire voir devant les élèves, l’élève a peur de s’indisposer devant le professeur et d’écoper un lourd revanche qui est lourd a payé, ainsi de suite et c’est une maillon de la chaine infernal de transmission des peurs.

Parlons de l’aura. On vous fait couvrir d’un aura dont la sorti est bouclé par l’aurore boréal. La sortie comme le nom l’indique c’est le Nord. Alors le Nord la direction des embarcations de fortunes est assuré pas par des A380 mais par des F 15 et F 16 Falcon. Bref à l’intérieur de cet aura c’est un infernal enfer dont l’initiative de briser doit naître d’un acharné sans peur hors de la dynastie des héritiers de la peurs : t’as ma parole.


Et si je me prenais pour un Keynes pour vous dire combien j’ai l’intention de vous proposer un système nouvelle pas dans le sens de vous inspirer le keynésianisme. Enfin c’est moi qu’on attendait. Je salue les œuvres des artistes du monde entier. Je certifie que l’œuvre des artisans du monde  serait plus en harmonies avec ce système d’action sans don.


 
Vrai ou faux ?

Quand la richesse devient pauvreté 
 
Que faire ? Façon de faire

Il y a mille façon de faire moi j’ai choisi … (Corneille Nyungura dans sa chanson …
 
Que faire ? Hommage

Je me méfie de votre générosité …(Corneille). Mais je rends hommage aux gens de cœur.
 
Que faire, Vrai ou faux (oui ou non) ?

A mon avis tous les moyens ne sont pas bons pour arriver à ses fins (finalités).
 
Que faire ?

La générosité : les limites. Sache que personne ne peut se porte garant de tes responsabilité. Si oui méfie-toi.
 
Que faire ?

On ne peut pas tous vivre en Europe –occident- (la France ne peut pas accueillir tout les maux du monde disait Charles Pasqua), le rêve de beaucoup d’africain. Ce pays qui est un mirage.
 
Que faire ? (désintoxication)

Si je ne le dis pas qui le dira. A quoi bon de vivre si je ne vis pas. Il y a ceux qui vivent et ceux qui vivotent.

Ce qu’il faut faire. Je respecte les œuvres architecturales. Malgré la pollution que leur production aurait engendrée. Je ne peux pas démolir les World Trade Center ou le quartier de la Défense (Paris). Mais je me permets de m’opposer à un probable mouvement  datant d’il y a 2000 ans (selon les conteurs). Ce mouvement amené en Afrique et qui a servi pour la conquête des âmes. Mais vraiment la conquête totale. Ces âmes errent encore. Ils ne se sont pas encore retrouvés dans l’espoir de se caser un jour. La recherche se fait tout azimut la multiplication de sectes religieuses comme des champignons, …la recherche, toujours la recherche. Mais ils cherchent quoi ? [se débarrasser de la peur et vivre. La solution est de tuer la peur. La peur tue l’espoir de vivre. La méthode c’est la désintoxication de la société].

Débarrassez-vous de vos escarres dues à une longue période passé endormi. Rajeunissez vous et passer à l’action. Dans une mine quand on fait l’extraction des minerais à la fin de l’extraction ils ont autours d’eux des gangrènes. Que faire pour les hommes ? Dans l’extraction minière on a beaucoup de procédé. Les hommes ne sont pas des minerais. L’homme pour se changer il doit prendre conscience de son état et avoir la volonté de changer. Vous êtes peureux, vous dormez c’a produit les escarres. Réveillez vous, débarrassez vous de la peur et des escarres et l’or luira. La lune brillera. Nous serons en harmonies avec notre nature.
 
Que faire ?

Pour mieux résoudre un problème il faut partir de deux côté. De l’amont (coordination) et de l’aval (actes individuel). Depuis l’aval il faut monter. Monter c’est l’une des tâches les plus durs. Mais c’est quand l’amont est mal assuré. Et l’amont peut se situer au même niveau que l’aval dans le sens où l’amont est l’acquis qui te permet de mettre en action les accomplissements personnels.
 
==Tout se passe dans la tête…alors comme on le sait que faire.==

Nouveau concept : actions sans dons, actions sans faire appels aux dons

Attrape moi, rejoins moi, …si tu peux.
On a rien à rattraper mais des choses à faire.
 
Tout se passe dans la tête

L’handicap n’est pas un vice
 
Tout se passe dans la tête

L’histoire semble ne pas avoir d’exception. Les guerres ont existé partout. La condition humaine a rencontré des difficultés au cours de l’histoire mais ce que vit l’Afrique actuellement mérite une attention.

Je n’ose pas comparer ce qui s’est passé dans les deux conflits mondiaux qui ont provoqué les deux guerres mondiales aux différents conflits qui naissent comme des champignons dans le berceau de l’humanité. Mais il faut signaler après les deux guerres, la paix entre les anciens belligérants (France et Allemagne) était une utopie. Mais comme vous le connaissez la paix est devenue chose de la vie courante dans cet endroit.


On cherche à étudier, étudier, …jusqu’où je me demande ? Le fils de bourge nait BAC, MBA, Ph.D, …en main ce qu’il fait c’est la validation à volonté pour finir dans le créneau qui l’attend depuis la naissance, dans l’autre cas il se livre dans n’importe quoi parce qu’il peut vivre de rente venant dans cet endroit que je commence à me lasser de répéter.
 
CONCLUSION

Le message

Je ne fais pas l’incitation à la haine. Je fais l’incitation à la prise de conscience des dirigeants corrompu ou pas, délégués ou pas (délégués dans le sens ou il est en place pour assurer les intérêt des multinationales comme d’habitude), élus ou pas…Prise de conscience de tout le monde de l’état des lieux comme on le fait avant d’entrée dans une nouvelle maison pour la location
 
Le message (suite)

J’incite les gens à rompre avec cet héritage de la peur. L’héritage d’un vice n’est pas l’idéal.
 
L’auteur

Pourquoi j’ai choisi les sciences sociales ? J’étais bon en Mathématiques. Je n’ai pas pris les sciences appelé aussi molles pour fuir les durs qu’ils sont. Dans un pays où faire les sciences molles est synonyme de lâcheté et de bassesse d’esprit. Je les ai choisies parce que je ne pouvais plus tenir en regardant les personnes qui agonissaient et qui mourraient de faim de maladies, etc. alors que je maitrisais les formules mathématiques sans espoir de m’en servir plus tard dans n’importe quel domaine porteur d’espoir dans un pays qui est (était) le mien au moment d’option. J’étais bon pour maitriser et prêt pour apporter ce qui manquer à ce pays qui est le Rwanda. Le Rwanda et beaucoup d’autres pays africains ont besoin de matières grises pour concevoir des programmes et plans qui sont les leurs (adaptés et faites par, pour et  au intéressés).

Galilée a été poussé à la mort sous les ordres du Pape Urbain VIII. Qui lui consigna de rester dans sa villa d'Arcetri près de Florence. Je n’ai pas peur d’être poussée à la mort ou décapité par un mouvement ou un individu qui se sentirait blessé par mes convictions vu que les conditions de renvoyer à la mort en douceur évolue parallèlement avec d’autres applications. Ça serait une réussite c’est ce fait qui deviendrait prescripteur comme l’est devenu les média qui se sont vu remplacés par les événements en ce qui concerne la capacité de transmission de message. Mais je ne compte pas réussir après ma mort.

Je n’ai pas besoin de prouver ce que je dis parce que je n’accuse personne. A moins que tu te sentes indirectement dans ce récit. Dans ce cas réconcilie-toi toi-même. Et ce n’est pas en fournissant la preuve qu’un mensonge devient une réalité. Mais la vérité reste inébranlable même mil ans après (l’exemple c’est  l’énoncé de Galileo Galilei).


Enfin j’ai découvert qui j’étais et je suis content. Ma grande sœur me disait dans des sorties pourquoi tu ne viens pas avec les autres ? A cette époque je répondais ce qui me passait par la tête justifiant les raison que j’ignorais encore. Maintenant j’ai découvert qui je suis, qui j’étais et qui je serais. Heureusement il n’était pas encore tard même s’il n’est jamais tard (il est toujours temps pour quelque chose) .Un descendant de la lignée des peureux qui a renoncé à son héritage : la peur. Qui s’est libéré de fils de téléguidage comme l’artiste le fait pour les marionnettes.

Je me mettais toujours à côté, à l’écart, de loin ou de prêt je décortiquais le système dans lequel je me trouvais. Je suis arrivé au bon endroit, au bon moment sans attachement à un tiers système pouvant m’embourbé comme l’(les systèmes) ont l’habitude de le faire. J’oublie un certain homme qui a dit c’est à la Fac où l’on tue les probables futurs révolutionnaires (ce qui n’est pas automatiquement le cas). Je le dis sans bavure, sans truchement : ce qui se conçoit bien s’énonce bien.


Quand on habite dans le XVIème arrondissement on ne comprend pas comme est-ce possible.
Mille « je »
 	Je vois ce qu’on ne voit pas.
 	J’entends ce qu’on ne dit pas
 	J’entends ce qu’on ne veut pas dire
 	Je vois ce qu’on ne veut pas montrer
 	On a longuement parlé
 	L’intelligence est de poser de bonne question
 	Je compte aller voir ce qu’on fait dans tout les coins du monde pour enfin propager la culture des terriens, évidemment pour et chez qui veule bien m’accueillir et me partager la culture de la terre malgré la peine et le temps passé pour y arriver. Ce qui est la cas comme d’habitude chez ces gens qui travaille dans des cuvettes abyssales (fin fonds souterrain pour ne pas faire part aux autres leurs technologies). A quoi servirait-il cette intelligence de laisser les autres comme ça soit disant qu’il fasse eux aussi des efforts mais réellement avec l’objectif de leur infliger une peine qu’ils pourraient être épargné. Ca semble être une utopie.

Je suis là ne me fait pas la tête. Ca ne suffit pas d’arriver, parce que…va voir dans la vérité tout craché ce qu’ils vivent, ceux qui sont arrivé. Là on vous raconte ce qui se passe pour la majorité.
 
Les phrases brutes


-	Ce n’est pas en fournissant les preuves que les mensonges deviennent réalités
-	Pourquoi il y a ces grèves incessantes c’est parce que ce pays dont vous rêvez n’existe qui vous aurez compris cela vous arrêterez 
-	Made in Africa (what is made in Africa?)
-	Combien ça coute un nègre (une carabine coute 100 nègre), un Caucase, un asiatique, une peau rouge,…
-	Je ne défends aucune thèse. Les histoires de thèses. Aldous Huxley disait ce qu’on fait dans les thèses c’est démontrer qui a dit quoi, qui a provoqué qui a dire quoi ? etc.
-	Eric Dacheux dans in Communication Politique de l’Union Européenne, impossible défi. Il dit la paix en Europe était une utopie il y a environ 60 ans. Mais actuellement c’est devenu quelque chose de la vie quotidienne.
-	Je suis là pour le dire
-	Tout a commencé à l’époque de Sparte. Le besoin commun était la protection si j’ose dire en gros la guerre (toujours dans des phrases qui ne sont pas vrai (« si vici pacem para bellum : si tu veux la paix prépare la guerre » ou encore la meilleure défense c’est l’attaque, c’est vrai. Enfin tout vient de l’ignorance ou de la transposition de tous ces beaux mots à l’envers. Peut être encore de cet héritage du langage belliqueux qui nous évince. En plus des manifestations communicatives (kinésique, …) le langage tient la place capital. L’héritage latin vient des romains qui l’ont à leur tout hérité des grecques (spartiate en partie) : l’époque de l’éducation spartiate. Mais comme toujours ça c’est discutable. C’est juste pour amener le sujet où je veux en venir Socrate l’appelait l’accouchement de l’idée : la maïeutique.
-	Histoire d’Alain doyen du collège. C’est pendant la campagne électorale des représentants des élèves : doyen et doyenne. Chaque option (section) donne son candidat. Il y avait deux prétendants dans notre classe. Ce qui est signe déjà du mauvais départ pour les élections même entre les élèves de la même classe on ne s’entend pas ce qui est signe du non union. Mais ce n’est pas vrai. Ce ne pas parce qu’on a des opinions différents des autres qu’on n’est pas tout au contraire. Je viens de m’apercevoir juste aujourd’hui en rédigeant ce passage combien on était con. Et pourtant on faisait les sciences sociales. C’était nous qui était mieux placé par rapport au descendant d’Einstein. Pour nous départager il suffisait de faire les élections entre notre classe pour enfin proposer un candidat venant non des compromis farfelu. Je me rappelle que je remplissais plus les conditions que lui mais les conditions (que je n’expliquerai pas ici faute de peur la peur) faisait de lui le mieux placé pour représenter notre section. Enfin je reviens sur ma décision ci haute invoquée. J’avais dis que n’aller pas expliquer les conditions qui le placer en tête. Ces histoires qui nous hantent. Histoire de hutu tutsi. Ce ne pas parce qu’on ne le dit pas que ça n’existe pas ou que ça cessera d’exister par contre ça continuera de miner les relations entre ces personnes appelés à vivre ensemble quoi que soi leur appartenance. Il y a une organisation qui s’appelle le FARG (fonds d’assistance aux rescapés du génocide). FARG c’est une organisation qui s’occupe en gros de tout sur les rescapés : habitat, soin de santé, des fois l’alimentation, les bourses d’études des rescapés, etc. A cette époque c’était dans la période de commémoration du génocide avec le deuil qui dure une semaine au niveau national et en tout lieu. Déjà c’était mal parti pour les élections dans une période reconnu sensible surtout aux élèves qui ont des rechutes de traumatismes liés au génocide réellement ou par caprices pour éviter la période d’examen qui s’approche. Au Collège Saint-André fut cet événement retenu par l’intéressé qui est moi. Pendant leurs rituels de célébrations il exista ce meeting qui décida que le doyen doit être du FARG. Par prudence l’information m’arriva à temps pour réagir.
-	Cette église non ces églises qui poussent comme des champignons sont encore des assureurs de la pérennité de cet héritage de la peur dont on est loin de se débarrasser tant qu’il y aura tous ces prêcheurs qui viennent tout azimut au lieu de prêcher le travail il prêche les 35H à l’église. Je ne dis pas que l’église est mauvaise, mais ces prélats ont des débauches qu’il faut signaler au passage. Et ces prêtres qui sont-ils ? Des ratés. Ces ratés qui ont trouvé refuge dans le peloton conduit par l’écurie romaine régnant dans/sur un paradis (le rêve ou l’enseignement des africains) fiscale : La cité du Vatican. Cette écurie tient les rênes du globe à part immobiliser dans une mondialisation privé et fermé où Le Vatican assure le monopole du marché.


-	Ces gens qui disent heureux les pauvres et passe toute leur vie à fouille même dans les poches des plus démuni. Je vous le dis c’est aujourd’hui ou jamais. Réveillez vous. Je crois en Dieu et toutes les litanies qu’on m’a racontées parce que ce n’est que ça que je connais.
-	Ici est ailleurs, les amérindiens justifient leur cueillette par le fait qu’ils ne peuvent pas éventrer la Terre (leur mère), ils ont raison parce que tout le monde a sa raison (le cœur a ses raisons que la raison ne connait pas). Par contre ils exagèrent, je dirais. C’était vrai il y a mil ans quand la densité de la terre était moins 11hab/km2 (y compris les mers et les océans), 44hab/ km2 (en comptant que les continents). Ces chiffres sont les chiffres d’aujourd’hui en 2007. Avec l’augmentation de la population la cueillette devient impossible ce qui impose la gestion et l’organisation de l’exploitation : c’est la naissance de politique. Gestion (organisation) de la cité.
-	Echange ne veut pas dire inféodation.
-	Dans des HLM il y a combien de tête prête à booster l’Afrique ? Peu. C’est vrai que là toutes les conditions sont réunies pour fabriquer des tubes digestifs autonomes : les automates. A moins qu’un coup d’éclat fasse l’erreur de déclencher les potentialités latentes à tout faire pour se mettre à écrire un tel bouquin. Ca ne servirait à rien de décrire les HLM que d’aggraver la situation et d’enchanter les promoteurs de cette politique.
-	Dans que faire utilisons le cinéma pour simuler la réalité africaine : -monter la vraie image –jouer sur l’ignorance (de prendre pour réaliste les scènes cinématographique) mais en les inculquant les vrais valeurs, la réalité, 
-	Tout ce qu’on fait (soit pas ignorance, soit par intelligence –connaissance de cause) a des retombées 


La science une religion

Les grands maîtres dans différents religion nous conseillent avant da passer à l’action dans toute forme de spiritualité qu’il faut d’abord contempler. De même ce dogme s’applique aussi à la religion science mais la question qui se pose est jusque quand ?

Dans la religion qui s’appelle science cette contemplation est la fréquentation de l’école (primaire, collège, lycée), fac (université) etc. Dans ces milieu fréquentés il faut aussi s’appliquer : fréquenter les bibliothèques, les colloques et j’en passe. En plus de cela il ne faut pas se contenter de ce que le prof vous donne comme matière syllabus ou pas. Par contre il faut avoir une auto détermination et chercher toi-même parce que tu n’es pas obligé de croire ce que le prof t’enseigne comme c’est le cas dans toutes les religions mais après le mieux est de trouver un terrain d’entente par après parce que l’éloignement sans retour aussi n’est pas préférable.

Comme d’autres brebis d’autres religions le scientifique (religieux) doit avoir le temps de baptême, ascèse, …


Les sciences

En économie il y a une assertion « ceteris paribus » sa traduction en français c’est « si toute chose restant égale par ailleurs ». Sans cette assertion en économie il y a aucune théorie qui resterait indemne [  ]. En mathématique on dit supposons que x=1 ou 2 et après les opérations continue ou commencent. Si on ne suppose pas ainsi on ne peut rien faire en mathématique. Bref j’ai pu avoir les précisions sur ces sciences mais je sais qu’il y a d’autres sciences qui ont le même moyen pour s’en sortir (démarrer).

Par contre il y a d’autres sciences comme la médecine, l’agronomie et le vétérinaire qui sont à mon avis les sciences pas comme les autres. Les sciences pas comme les autres ça veut dire les sciences dont le début n’est pas une assertion comme j’ai donné l’exemple mais ces derniers leurs activités se résume en la production.

Si je dis ça ne veut pas dire que ces autres sciences ne font rien par contre c’est pour montrer le début de nos problèmes actuels (chômage). A vous de juger si le chômage est un problème ou nom. Mais tant qu’on produit les demandeurs d’emploi sans produire les créateurs d’emploi ce fait (chômage) restera insoluble. Ici ce que tout le monde doit savoir c’est sa place suivant l’état ou la période. En plus de connaître sa place il faut savoir ce qu’on doit faire pour l’autre. Je crois que si tout le monde dans ses recherches chercher ce qu’il peut faire pour l’autre science ça arrangerait les problèmes. Je ne suis pas contre la spécialisation mais (…) je donne l’exemple d’un spécialiste en Mathématique ? A vous de juger. Je ne m’oppose aux mathématiciens mais les mathématiques sont là pour travailler avec les autres sans oublier que c’est le cas pour tous les champs qui se revendique être scientifiques.  

A mon avis la politique de l’éducation nationale de chaque pays est à refondre dans le pire des cas, parce qu’il faut avouer qu’il y a des pays qui sont allés loin, laisser les pays leader charismatique dans le domaine faire cette tâche. Mais il faut signaler que chaque quelque chose à dire [  ].

Chacun pour soi

Chacun pour soi ce ne pas aussi mal que ça. Pire c’est quand le chacun pour soi est couplé de pratiques visant à enfoncer son prochain pour acquérir quoi que ce soit.
Une anecdote : il y avait deux groupes de personnes.

Une méthode. (Probablement dans l’introduction)

Il est rare que les gens disent ce qu’ils pensent. La preuve est que tout le temps ou presque on interchange les mots suivant : comment ça va ? L’autre ça va. Ensuite, tu vas bien ? Même si tu es malade des fois on dit que ça va. Ce qui veut dire que les gens auront peur d’entendre la vérité ou quand il demande les nouvelles il n’est pas à les entendre. L’autre cas est le concerné qui peut ne pas être disposé à faire part des ses nouvelles. Alors je vais répondre à tout les comment ça va auquel je, tu, il, nous, vous et ils n’ont pas répondu et enfin comment va l’Afrique.

Coup théâtral (ça me donne l’idée de comment je vais construire second life versus second hand)
T’as vu ton cousin, Lequel ? L’autre là ! Non mais, moi je vois un singe et rien d’autre. Mais oui c’est ça, je te parle du singe. C’est ton cousin non ? Non non non ! Toi aussi tu exagères. Mais c’est ce qua dit Darwin ? Un scientifique comme les autres qui disent les bêtises. Et toi qui est ton cousin ? Bah, on ne sait pas d’où je viens parce que je ne l’ai pas dit, mais toi j’ai dit d’où tu venais et on l’a cru et le monde entier en parle.

Les copains de St Pierre
Mais les copains de St pierre nous apprennent à travers le Best Seller eternel (la bible) qu’au commencement nous avons été crée par Dieu et que nous sommes les descendants d’un seul couple, voyez-vous ?
Et après au fait moi je dirai (pour couper court) qu’on est tombé du ciel pour venir salir le monde, pour donner du boulot aux blancs inventeur du feu, de la machine, de la vapeur, du pétrole, du gaz, de l’électricité, du fleuve Congo, enfin inventeur de tout.

Emera nongereho aka gatekerezo à propos des idées cg des &quot;Héritiers de la peur&quot; :
 
Si nous prenons peu à peu l'habitude d'accorder quelque attention à ce qui se passe dans notre univers intérieur, aux mouvements de nos pensées qui vont de-ci, de-là, nous deviendrons plus habiles à interpréter leur cheminement silencieux ou leurs entrechoquements discordants. Ainsi, avec une perception plus fine des événements intérieurs que nous vivons, nous pouvons espérer mieux garder la cohérence de notre option fondamentale ; autrement dit, éviter, autant que faire se peut, les écarts discordants en notre marche vers une vie entièrement accordée à la VERITE et NON à la PEUR!

Nice, la ville rêve.

Ce n’est pas possible. Il faut vous mettre en tête que ce n’est pas possible. Tout ces gens ne peuvent pas tous vivre des rentes venant de l’exploitation de l’Afrique et l’exploitation d’autres esprits pas encore avisés. Si c’était l’objectif, vous en êtes très loin d’aboutir. Nous les terriens on peut tous vivre en paix, dignement, côte à côte, parce que la terre nous appartient et vice versa. J’ai enfin trouvé des icônes pouvant bien simuler l’intérêt de chacun. Les couleurs, les chiffres, et toutes autres types de référence que l’homme s’est toujours fait donne l’impression d’un dominant et d’un assujetti. Mais enfin les voilà : le feu, l’eau et l’air. Le trio. La manne de l’homme. Les trois ingrédients vitaux de l’homme. Les trois denrées aux quels personne ne peut soustraire son prochain, pire ne devait pas soustraire son prochain.

Le malheur est que ces trois denrées sont les prochains objectifs de conquêtes là où ce n’est pas encore commencé. Parce que l’enfer arrive au bout de nez chez nos confrères terriens qui n’ont plus droit à cette source divine</text>

== Section 3 - Term-based guide to documentation ==
There are many acronyms in use in datasheets and documentation to name peripherals and features and it is not always clear what exactly is meant by them or how they relate to similar peripherals on products from other semiconductor vendors. In this section the acronyms used to describes peripherals and features on PIC microcontrollers and digital signal controllers will be listed and explained followed by the acronyms used by other semiconductor vendors. This will allow those seeking to move from other semiconductor manufacturers products to Microchip products the opportunity to quickly understand what peripheral or feature name to search for based upon their current knowledge of other devices.

=== Microchip PIC MCUs and DSCs ===

== G ==

===== GPR =====
* '''GPR - General Purpose Register''' - a register in data memory with no predefined functionality. The functionality is defined by the programmer. Each GPR is, in reality, a unit of SRAM. The wording &quot;register&quot; is used in preference to &quot;SRAM&quot; to convey the idea that all SRAM in the data memory has equal standing to the WREG in that the result from an instruction can be written directly back into a GPR as the architecture does not force the result to be stored in an accumulator and then later moved from the accumulator into SRAM as would be required on some other microprocessor architectures.

== M ==
* '''MSSP - Master Synchronous Serial Port''' - a serial peripheral interface that can be used either as an I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;C, SPI or Microwire&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; interface.

== P ==
* '''PPS - Peripheral Pin Select''' - a module allowing peripherals with a standard digital input or output to be connected to one of up to 30 remappable pins on the controller. Remappable peripherals include (but are not limited to) the CCP module, comparator outputs and the UARTs. Peripheral inputs and outputs which are not remappable are those which have a purely analogue functionality (A/D converter), which are complex (PMP parallel interface) or use a special I/O circuitry (I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;C). Remappable inputs and outputs may be connected to more than one pin simultaneously, may be connected to the same pin (to increase drive strength as an example) and an single pin could be simultaneously connected to an input from one peripheral and an output from another (allowing hardware loopback for a serial interface).

== S ==
* '''SFR - Special Function Register''' - a register in data memory with a defined functionality, such as the STATUS register or a register used to configure a hardware module. The opposite of a [[#GPR]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Creating a new version of an existing CRF ==
=== Download the CRF ===

Login to OpenClinica as Study Director and click on &quot;Tasks&quot;. Choose &quot;CRFs&quot; from the list 
under header &quot;Administration&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:TaskMenuCRF.jpg|none|thumbs|400px|Taskmenu]]
&lt;br&gt;
Select the CRF you want to revise in the next screen (&quot;Administer Case Report Forms (CRFs))&quot; and click
on the white arrow in the &quot;Download&quot; column. Clicking this link starts a download of the excelsheet which contains your CRF's settings.

[[Image:TaskMenuCRFDownload.jpg|none|thumbs||CRF download]]


Save the excelsheet to your computer. Open it using MSExcel, start with the first tab &quot;CRF&quot; and fill in a new version number in cell B2.&lt;br&gt;
Then edit and change anything you want and save the excelfile.

=== Upload changed CRFs ===
Switch back to OpenClinica &quot;Administer Case Report Forms (CRFs)&quot; and click the icon 
labeled &quot;Create New Version&quot; (the column on the right in &quot;Actions&quot;).
[[Image:TaskMenuCRFCreateNewVersion.jpg|none|thumbs||Taskmenu]]

You get a screen very similar to that when creating a new CRF, but this one is titled &quot;Create
a CRF Version for X&quot; (see below). Click the button labeled '''Browse''' and browse to the location on your PC where
you saved your excelfile. Click on &quot;Preview CRF Version&quot; to have the CRF validated.
[[Image:CreateNewVersionOfCRF.jpg|none|thumbs||Create new version of CRF]]

=== Consequences of creating a new version ===
If no errors were found, the CRF will be included in your list of available CRFs. 
If the previous version of this particular CRF was never used you can overwrite it (though Item OIDs will change): 
just leave the version in cell B2 unchanged. On validating you will be asked if it's OK to overwrite the former CRF.

In any other case you now have two or more versions of a CRF. This means that you have to define which version should be the default version for each event using this CRF.

This may look like a petty thing, but it is not so when you have more studies or events using the same CRF. 
If you change the default to the new version for one study, this will apply to all (maybe a bit more than you wanted).
Considering this it might be advisable to make copies of the existing CRFs when using them for another study.

Another not so trivial consequence of having a new version of your CRF is that you may need to update any rules that refer to a specific CRF version.  Note that you can't download a &quot;version&quot; of a rule, edit it and upload it again - you need to update a stored copy of the rules XML.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Assigning a CRF to a study ==
			 
=== Study Event Definitions ===
Once you have created one or more CRFs, you'll want to assign them to a study. There is
a level in between however: the event. This is also called an
EventDefinition or StudyEventDefinition (SED) and is (more or less) a study
visit. If you want to use a CRF in a study, you must first define the
EventDefinitions / visits in that study.&lt;br /&gt;
If you haven't done this already, click on &quot;Tasks&quot; -&gt; &quot;Study setup&quot; -&gt; &quot;Build study&quot;. 
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:TaskMenuBuildStudy.jpg|none|thumbs||Task menu - Build study]]
&lt;br&gt;

Go to step 3 &quot;Create Event Definitions&quot; in the screen that now opens, 
click on the + sign and follow the instructions. (For more detailed instructions,
see [[../CreateANewEventDefinition/|Create a New Event Definition]].)
After you have added your event/visit, you'll get a list of available
CRFs and you can link any number of them to this event/visit (see instructions below).

=== How to add a CRF to a study event ===
If you already have one or more EventDefinitions in your study, return to
the &quot;Build study&quot; page and this time click on the magnifier icon in step 3
			&quot;Create Event Definitions&quot;.
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:ViewEventDefinitions.jpg|none|thumbs||View event definitions]]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You will get a list of your EventDefinitions
titled &quot;Manage All Event Definitions in Study X&quot;.			
Click the pencil icon (&quot;Edit&quot;) on the right of the event/visit you want to assign the CRF to.

[[Image:ManageEventDefinitions.jpg|none|thumbs||Manage event definitions]]
&lt;br&gt;

This opens the edit form for the event, which has an upper part for editing details about the event itself and a
lower part that shows the CRFs associated with this event. 
Click on the link &quot;Add a New CRF&quot;.
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:AddANewCRF.jpg|none|thumbs||Add a new CRF]]
&lt;br&gt;

A list appears with all available CRFs. 
Check the box on the right and click the &quot;Add&quot; button.
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:AddANewCRFToEvent.jpg|none|thumbs||Add a new CRF to an event]]
&lt;br&gt;

=== Edit the properties of the CRF ===
Now there's one last thing to do: edit the properties of the CRF for this 
particular event. If you're in a hurry, just untick &quot;Required&quot;, click &quot;Confirm&quot; and you're done.
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:CRFPropertiesForEvent.jpg|none|thumbs||Edit properties for this CRF in this event]]
&lt;br&gt;

=== View all CRFs in your study ===

To view a list of all the CRFs assigned to your study you have to follow almost the same steps as described above:
&quot;Tasks&quot; -&gt; &quot;Study Setup&quot; -&gt; &quot;Build Study&quot; -&gt; &quot;Create Event Definitions&quot; and then click the magnifier icon to display the 
&quot;Manage All Event Definitions in Study X&quot; screen. You will see no CRFs in this list, unless you click on &quot;Show More&quot;. Now two more columns are displayed: all the CRFs and their respective default versions.

      <comment>/* Emulating how regexps work in OpenClinica */ grammar and typo</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Using a regular expression to create a time field ==
Every now and then you may be in need of a time field. But, however flexible OpenClinica may be with dates and partial dates, there is no standard time-field-type. This can be solved by using a regular expression that checks all entries in a field.
=== The regular expression ===
We would like our time-field to accept input like 01:26 or 11:00 or 19:59 or 20:00 or 23:59 but to reject entries like 88:99 or 4:6.
Let's first concentrate on time values before 20:00. The regular expression would be '''[0-1]\d:[0-5]\d''' meaning more or less: first part of the hours is 0 or 1 ([0-1]), followed by a digit (\d), then the colon (:) followed by the minutes as something in the range from 0 to 5 ([0-5]) followed by a digit (\d). 
Then the time from 20:00 till 23:59. The regular expression would be quite similar: '''2[0-3]:[0-5]\d''' and that translates to: start with a 2 (2), followed by anything in the range from 0 to 3 ([0-3]), then the colon and the minutes, as described before.
The last thing to do is combine these two with a pipe(|): '''[0-1]\d:[0-5]\d|2[0-3]:[0-5]\d'''

=== Testing the regular expression with regexpal ===
Testing a regular expression in OpenClinica is not an easy task: you have to put the regexp in your XL-sheet and upload it. The syntax is validated, but not the result. In other words: your expression may be correct but accepts the wrong input or rejects the right input. Checking this in OC would require to add the CRF to a study event and then try different values. Then modify the regexp, upload a new version etc, until the results are OK.
Fortunately there are tools to do this for you and one of these is http://regexpal.com/. The interface consists of two text areas: one for your regular expression and one for your input. As you can see in the screenshot below I copied the regular expression in the first field and the values I would like to test in the second field.
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:RegExPal2.jpg|none|thumbs||Testing the regular expression in regexpal]]
&lt;br&gt;
Every bit of the text-string that matches the regular expression is highlighted in yellow or blue and you can see right away that this expression is working fine.

=== Emulating how regexps work in OpenClinica ===

If you want to test your regexps using regexpal in a similar way to how they are used in OpenClinica, you can wrap them in the text &quot;^()$&quot;:
&lt;pre&gt;^(regexp here)$&lt;/pre&gt;
This text restricts how the regexps are processed, ensuring that the match takes up the whole of one line (a similar restriction occurs in OpenClinica).

So, a regexp like this in OpenClinica:
&lt;pre&gt;regexp: /[0-9]/&lt;/pre&gt;
Would become this for testing in regexpal:
&lt;pre&gt;^([0-9])$&lt;/pre&gt;
Which would match:
&lt;pre&gt;4&lt;/pre&gt;
but not:
&lt;pre&gt;d4&lt;/pre&gt;
(as 4 isn't the only character on the line)

=== Putting the regular expression in your XL-sheet ===
Now you can use the regexp in your XL-sheet. Add an item in the usual way and use for RESPONSE_TYPE (col. N) &quot;text&quot;, for DATA_TYPE (col. T) &quot;ST&quot; for string. Your regexp goes in VALIDATION (col. V), preceeded by &quot;regexp:&quot; and enclosed in slashes. And in col. W goes your VALIDATION_ERROR_MESSAGE.
&lt;br&gt;
[[File:RegExInXL.jpg|none|thumbs||The regular expression in the CRF]]
&lt;br&gt;
And there you have it: your own time-field.

== An alternative way to add a timefield ==
When you need to compare times in your CRF, you must have numeric data. But in the case described above, the time field is of type ST and that means you can not do anything with it.
But if you're willing to sacrifice the time-format, you can more or less achieve this. The trick is to use a field of type REAL and then add a regular expression to it. Can you do that? Well, surprisingly you can. The regexp is used before the data is written to the database.

=== The other expession ===
The regexp we will use is 
'''regexp: /|[0-1][0-9]\.[0-5][0-9]|2[0-3]\.[0-5][0-9]/'''

Is works in the same way as the previous regexp, but now the separator is a dot. Because a dot has a meaning in regular expressions, you must precede the dot with a backslash. 
Now you can use the regexp in your XL-sheet. Add an item in the usual way and use for RESPONSE_TYPE (col. N) &quot;text&quot;, for DATA_TYPE (col. T) &quot;REAL&quot; for real. Your regexp goes in VALIDATION (col. V) and in col. W goes your VALIDATION_ERROR_MESSAGE.
&lt;br&gt;

[[File:How to set it in your XL.gif|none|thumbs||The regular expression in the CRF]]
&lt;br&gt;
And there you have it: a time-field to calculate with.

&lt;big&gt;'''Lymphoma Staging'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Staging==
*'''Ann Arbor stage''' (1971)
**Stage I: Single nodal group; or single extranodal organ in the absence of lymph node involvement (IE)
**Stage II: Multiple nodal groups on same side of the diaphragm; involvement of single extranodal organ with regional lymph node involvement (IIE)
**Stage III: On both sides of the diaphragm; accompanied by extralymphatic extension (IIIE)
**Stage IV: Diffuse extralymphatic involvement&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**Staging suffixes
***A and B classification: 
****A: absence of constitutional &quot;B&quot; symptoms
****B: presence of constitutional &quot;B&quot; symptoms (see below) 
***E: extralymphatic involvement (i.e. IIE)
***S: splenic involvement (i.e. IIIS)
***X: bulky mediastinal disease (i.e. IX). Defined as a ratio ≥ 1/3 of the maximum width of the mass on a PA chest X-ray and the maximum intrathoracic diameter&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**B-symptoms: unexplained fever &gt;38C / 100.4F, drenching night sweats, unexplained weight loss &gt;10% of baseline weight in the past 6 months. Not included as B symptoms: pruritus, alcohol intolerance, fatigue&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**&quot;Classic&quot; advanced disease: Stage III-B or IV.


*'''Cotswolds modification''' of Ann Arbor stage - PMID 2809679 (1989)
**Suffix X for bulky disease (nodes &gt; 10cm, or mediastinal mass 1/3 of thoracic diameter or &gt;10 cm)
**Subscript to indicate number of anatomic regions involved, e.g. II&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; Stage III may be subdivided into III&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and III&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: III&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (may involve splenic, hilar, celiac, or portal nodes) III&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (with para-aortic, iliac, or mesenteric nodes); staging should be identified as being clinical or pathologic
**Added categories of response to therapy (such as uncertain/unconfirmed CR, CRu)
**CRu - presence of an uncertain radiographic abnormality at the site of treated disease. This term was introduced because it is known that such abnormalities may persist for years without any sign of recurrence. Suspicious lesions should be biopsied


*Distinguishing extra-nodal disease from stage IV (guidelines):
** By site of origin: stomach, colon, brain, uterus--most likely extranodal; bone, lung--most likely Stage IV; 
** Bone marrow, liver, pleural, or CSF involvement--always stage IV
** Number of lesions: one--extranodal; many or diffuse--stage IV

&lt;big&gt;'''Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Early Stage Favorable'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Guidelines==
*'''American College of Radiology; 2008''' PMID 18812149 -- &quot;ACR Appropriateness Criteria on Hodgkin's lymphoma: favorable prognosis stage I and II.&quot; (Das P, J Am Coll Radiol. 2008 Oct;5(10):1054-66.)
**[http://www.acr.org/SecondaryMainMenuCategories/quality_safety/app_criteria/pdf/ExpertPanelonRadiationOncologyhodgkinsWorkGroup/FavorablePrognosisStageIandIIhodgkinsdiseaseUpdateinProgressDoc1.aspx Guideline link]

==Favorable prognostic factors==
*&lt;u&gt;NCCN guidelines&lt;/u&gt;: no bulky disease, 1-3 involved regions, 1 extranodal site, no B symptoms, ESR &lt;50
*&lt;u&gt;ACR appropriateness criteria&lt;/u&gt;: no bulky mediastinal disease, 1-3 involved regions, no B symptoms
*&lt;u&gt;EORTC&lt;/u&gt;: age &lt;=50, no bulky mediastinal adenopathy, 1-3 involved regions, no B symptoms and ESR &lt;50, B symptoms and ESR &lt;30

==RT Alone: Field Size==
*If patients negative subdiaphragmatic disease by staging laparotomy, Mantle field alone sufficient compared with STNI
*If patients clinically negative, Mantle field alone insufficient, however, STNI sufficient without requiring surgical staging


*'''EORTC H7-Very Favorable''' -- no staging laparoscopy + Mantle RT
**'''1997''' &lt;u&gt;ASTRO Abstract&lt;/u&gt; -- &quot;Combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy is advisable in all patients with clinical stage I-II Hodgkin's disease. Six-year results of the EORTC-GPMC controlled clinical trials 'H7-VF', 'H7-F' and 'H7-U'.&quot; (Noordijk EM, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1997; 39(2):S173
***Very favorable group subset (female, age &lt;40, stage IA, NS/LP histology, ESR &lt;50) treated with Mantle only, without PA field
***Outcome: 6-year RFS 73%, OS 96%
***Conclusion: Relapse rate unacceptably high in these clinically staged patients with Mantle RT only; arm closed

*'''EORTC H6-Favorable''' (1982-1988) -- staging laparoscopy + Mantle RT vs clinical staging + STNI
**Randomized. 262 patients, favorable prognosis (1-2 nodal areas, no bulky disease, no B symptoms and ESR &lt;50, B symptoms and ESR &lt;30). Arm 1) No staging laparotomy, Mantle + PA RT 40 Gy vs Arm 2) Staging laparotomy (-), Mantle RT 40 Gy
**'''1993''' PMID 7693881 -- &quot;&quot;Clinical staging versus laparotomy and combined modality with MOPP versus ABVD in early-stage Hodgkin's disease: the H6 twin randomized trials from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Lymphoma Cooperative Group.&quot; (Carde P, J Clin Oncol. 1993 Nov;11(11):2258-72.) Median F/U 5.3 years
***Outcome: In patients undergoing lap, 33% found lap (+). 6-year FFP laparoscopy + Mantle 83% vs Mantle + PA 78% (NS); 6-year OS 89% vs 93% (NS)
***Conclusion: No difference between surgical staging + mantle vs clinical staging + STNI

*'''EORTC H5-Favorable''' (1977-82) -- Mantle 40 Gy vs STNI 40 Gy
**Randomized. 198 patients, favorable (age &lt;=40, ESR &lt;=70, LP/NS, Stage I or Stage II without mediastinal involvement), negative staging laparotomy. Arm 1) Mantle RT 40 Gy vs Arm 2) Mantle RT + PA RT (T11-L4) 40 Gy
**'''1988''' PMID 2578012 -- &quot;Clinical stages I and II Hodgkin's disease: a specifically tailored therapy according to prognostic factors.&quot; (Carde P, J Clin Oncol. 1988 Feb;6(2):239-52.) Median F/U 5.3 years
***Outcome: 6-year RFS mantle 74% vs mantle+PA 72% (NS); 6-year OS 96% vs 89% (NS)
***Conclusion: In surgically staged patients, more limited RT (mantle alone) is sufficient

==RT Alone: Dose==
*'''German HD4''' (1988-1994) -- All IFRT 40 Gy, EFRT 40 Gy vs EFRT 30 Gy
**Randomized. 376 patients, Stage I-II, no risk factors (large mediastinal mass, extranodal lesions, massive splenic disease, elevated ESR, 3+ involved areas). Involved field RT 40 Gy. Arm 1) EFRT 40 Gy vs Arm 2) EFRT 30 Gy. No chemotherapy
**'''2001''' PMID 11387364 -- &quot;Low-dose radiation is sufficient for the noninvolved extended-field treatment in favorable early-stage Hodgkin's disease: long-term results of a randomized trial of radiotherapy alone.&quot; (Duhmke E, J Clin Oncol. 2001 Jun 1;19(11):2905-14.) Median F/U 7.2 years
***Outcome: 7-year RFP 40 Gy 78% vs 30 Gy 83% (NS); 7-year OS 91% vs 96% (NS). Worse outcome (RFS 72% vs 84%) with protocol violations
***Conclusion: 30 Gy dose adequate for clinically noninvolved areas


==RT vs Chemo-RT==
*'''German HD7''' (1993-1998) -- ABVD x2 + EFRT vs EFRT alone
**Randomized. 650 patients, Stage IA-IIB without risk factors. Treated with 1) RT alone vs. 2) ABVD x 2 cycles + RT RT same in both arms, given as EFRT 30 Gy + IFRT 10 Gy
**'''2007''' PMID 17606976 -- &quot;Two cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine plus extended-field radiotherapy is superior to radiotherapy alone in early favorable Hodgkin's lymphoma: final results of the GHSG HD7 trial.&quot; (Engert A, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Aug 10;25(23):3495-502.). Median F/U 7.2 years
***7-year outcome: no difference in survival (92% vs. 94%, NS), but significant difference in DFS RT alone 67% vs. CRT 88% (SS). Treatment relapse more successful for RT only arm
***Second malignancies: no difference, 0.8% per year, highest in older patients &amp; B-symptoms
***Conclusion: Combined modality more effective than EF-RT alone

*'''EORTC H8-Favorable''' (1993-1999) -- MOPP-ABV x3 + IFRT vs STNI alone
**Randomized. 542 patients, Stage I-II supradiaphragmatic HD, favorable (Prognostic score using [[Radiation_Oncology/Hodgkin/EORTC|EORTC H7]] criteria 1-5). Arm 1) [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations#MOPP-ABV|MOPP-ABV]] x3 cycles + IFRT (36 Gy if CR, 40-44 Gy if PR) vs. Arm 2) STNI alone (36 Gy + 4 Gy boost to involved fields)
**'''2007''' PMID 17989384 -- &quot;Chemotherapy plus involved-field radiation in early-stage Hodgkin's disease.&quot; (Ferme C, N Engl J Med. 2007 Nov 8;357(19):1916-27.). Median F/U 7.7 years
***H8-F Outcome: 5-year EFS MOPP-ABV + IFRT 98% vs. STNI 74% (SS); 10-year OS 97% vs. 92% (SS)
***Conclusion: For favorable disease, MOPP-ABV x3 cycles + IFRT is superior to STNI

*'''EORTC H7-Favorable''' (1988-1993) -- EBVP x6 + IFRT vs STNI alone
**Randomized. 333 patients with Stage I supradiaphragmatic HL, favorable (prognostic score 1-5). No staging laparotomy. Arm 1) STNI alone (36 Gy + 4Gy boost to involved fields) vs. Arm 2) [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations#EBVP|EBVP]] x6 cycles + IFRT (36-40 Gy)
**'''2006''' PMID 16754934 &amp;mdash; &quot;Combined-modality therapy for clinical stage I or II Hodgkin's lymphoma: long-term results of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer H7 randomized controlled trials.&quot; (Noordijk EM, J Clin Oncol. 2006 Jul 1;24(19):3128-35.) Median F/U 8.7 years
***Outcome: 10-yr EFS STNI 78% vs. EBVP+IF 88% (SS). OS similar at 92%. 
***Conclusion: Combined EBVP x6 + IFRT is superior STNI alone

==Chemo-RT: RT Dose==
*'''EORTC H9-Favorable''' (1998-2004) -- EBVP x6 followed IFRT 36 Gy vs IFRT 20 Gy vs No RT
**Randomized. ''Arm 3 stopped early due to &gt;20% of failure.'' 783 favorable Stage I-II patients enrolled, 619 achieved CR(u) on EBVP x6 and were randomized. Arm 1) 36 Gy IF-RT Arm vs. 2) 20 Gy IF-RT vs. 3) no RT. Arm 3 stopped early due to high recurrence (&gt;20%).  
**'''2005''' [http://www.asco.org/ASCOv2/Meetings/Abstracts?&amp;vmview=abst_detail_view&amp;confID=34&amp;abstractID=30245 ASCO abstract] -- &quot;First results of the EORTC-GELA H9 randomized trials: the H9-F trial (comparing 3 radiation dose levels) and H9-U trial (comparing 3 chemotherapy schemes) in patients with favorable or unfavorable early stage Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL).&quot; (Noordijk, EM ASCO 2005). Median F/U 2.7 years
***Outcome: 4-year EFS 36 Gy 87% vs 20 Gy 84% vs. no RT 70% (SS). 4 yr OS 98% in all arms.
***Conclusion: In favorable patients in CR after 6 cycles of EBVP, omission of IFRT leads to unacceptable failure rate; 20 Gy provides comparable control as 36 Gy

*'''HD10''' (1998-2002) -- 2x2: ABVD x2 vs ABVD x4; IFRT 30 Gy vs 20 Gy
**Randomized, 2x2. 1370 pts. Stage IA, IB, IIA, IIB (Note only ~7% of patients had B Symptoms) without risk factors (ie, large mediastinal mass, size &gt;1/3 of the maximum thorax diameter, extranodal disease, 3 or more nodal areas, or elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (&gt; 50 mm/h for stages IA, IIA and &gt; 30 mm/h for stages IB, IIB). Randomization #1) ABVD x4 cycles vs ABVD x2 cycles, and randomization #2) IFRT 30 Gy vs IFRT 20 Gy
**'''2009; 5-years''' ASH Abstract #716 [http://ash.confex.com/ash/2009/webprogram/Paper21388.html Abstract] - No PMID (Abstract only) &amp;mdash; &quot;Two Cycles of ABVD Followed by Involved Field Radiotherapy with 20 Gray (Gy) Is the New Standard of Care in the Treatment of Patients with Early-Stage Hodgkin Lymphoma: Final Analysis of the Randomized German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) HD10.&quot; (Engert A; Dec 2009) Median F/U 6.6 years 
***ABVD Outcome: No significant difference in 5-year OS, FFTF, or PFS between ABVD x 4 and ABVD x 2 (OS 97% vs 97%; FFTF 93% vs 91%; PFS 93% vs 91%). 
***IFRT Outcome: No significant difference between IFRT 30 Gy vs 20 Gy (OS 98% vs 97%, FFTF 93% vs 93%, PFS 94% vs 93%). No difference when all 4 arms compared.
***Conclusion: 2 cycles of ABVD followed by 20 Gy IFRT is the new standard for GHSG for early favorable HD
**'''2010; 5-years''' PMID 20818855 -- &quot;Reduced Treatment Intensity in Patients with Early-Stage Hodgkin's Lymphoma&quot; (Engert A, N Engl J Med 2010 Aug 12;363(7):640-652.)
***For comparison of ABVD 2 cycles vs 4 cycles, no difference in FFTF or OS -- 5-yr FFTF 93.0% (ABVD x 4) vs 91.1% (ABVD x 2). For comparison of RT dose, no differences. Percent of grade 3/4 toxicities higher in group of ABVD x 4 vs ABVD x 2,  55% vs 33 % p=sig and XRT 30 Gy vs 20 Gy, 8.7% vs 2.9% p=sig.  6 treatment related deaths occured in ABVD x 4 vs 1 death in ABVD x 2.
***Conclusion: ABVD x 2 + 20 Gy IFRT is as effective as ABVD x 4 + 30 Gy.

==Chemo-RT vs Chemo Alone==
*'''EORTC H10''' -- PET scan guided early treatment adaptation (omission of RT)
**See details at: [[Radiation_Oncology/Hodgkin/EORTC#H10 | H10]]
**Conclusion: &quot;combined-modality treatment resulted in fewer early progressions in clinical stage I/II HL&quot;


*'''EORTC H9-Favorable''' (1998-2004) -- EBVP x6 followed IFRT 36 Gy vs IFRT 20 Gy vs No RT
**Randomized. ''Arm 3 stopped early due to &gt;20% of failure.'' 783 favorable Stage I-II patients enrolled, 619 achieved CR(u) on EBVP x6 and were randomized. Arm 1) 36 Gy IF-RT Arm vs. 2) 20 Gy IF-RT vs. 3) no RT. Arm 3 stopped early due to high recurrence (&gt;20%).

==American War for Independence [1775–1783]==
===Hopkins's Expedition, 1776===
Commodore [[w:Esek Hopkins|Esek Hopkins]] fleet—along with marine detachments of 230 men—departed Philadelphia on 4 January 1776. Samuel Nicholas's Continental marines embarked onto five vessels for their maiden voyage: [[w:USS Alfred (1774)|USS ''Alfred'']]—Hopkins [[w:flagship|flagship]], [[w:USS Andrew Doria (1775)|USS ''Andrew Doria'']], [[w:USS Cabot (1775)|USS ''Cabot'']], [[w:USS Columbus (1774)|USS ''Columbus'']], and [[w:USS Providence (1775)|USS ''Providence'']]; comprising the entirety of the Continental Navy.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt;  One of Hopkins's captains in command of USS ''Columbus'', the recently commissioned Captain [[w:Abraham Whipple|Abraham Whipple]] (and resigned Commodore of the [[w:Rhode Island Navy|Rhode Island Navy]]), performed this exact task in clearing the [[w:The Carolinas|Carolina]] coast of enemy shipping many months earlier, before his commission into the Continental navy. This was the first [[w:expeditionary warfare|amphibious/expedition]] for the Continental Navy-Marine Corps. Hopkins was given the task to patrol the southern American coastline to intercept and clear any presence of British troops along the [[w:Delaware River|Delaware River]], and [[w:Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake Bay]], then return north to New England and perform similar services.&lt;ref&gt;Letter:  Naval Committee to Commodore Esek Hopkins (5 January 1776); NDAR, III: 637–638.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day [5 January], they sailed down the Delaware River and its approaches off [[w:Liberty Island|Liberty Island (Mud Island)]]. After dusk, the weather turned bitterly cold, freezing the river shore to shore. They remained stuck for more than a week. Momentarily, during the first thaw, [[w:USS Providence (1775)|USS ''Providence'']] joined the Continental fleet. On 17 January, the ships dropped further downstream to [[w:Port Penn|Port Penn]] on the Delaware shore behind [[w:Reedy Island|Reedy Island]] where cold weather returned and they were again ice-bound. They remained there until 11 February when Hopkins was able to move them to [[w:Cape Henlopen|Cape Henlopen]]. On 13 February, the small [[w:sloop|sloop]]s [[w:USS Fly (1776)|USS ''Fly'']], [[w:USS Hornet (1775)|USS ''Hornet'']], and the [[w:schooner|schooner]] [[w:USS Wasp (1775)|USS ''Wasp'']], traveling from [[w:Colony of Maryland|Maryland]], joined Hopkins's squadron off the [[w:Delaware Capes|capes of Delaware]]. However, two nights out, off the [[w:Virginia Capes|Virginia capes]] USS ''Fly'' fouled USS ''Hornet'' and both was forced to return to home port for repairs.

By 17 February, warmer temps thawed the ice and Hopkins's fleet sailed back out to sea. During this delayed period allowed Hopkins to monitor the British forces at Reedy Island for some six weeks. For reasons that remain obscure, he disobeyed his ambitious orders to safeguard the southern American coastline as he considered his orders discretionary and the enemy too strong; without proper authority he directed his squadron to head south en route to the [[w:West Indies|West Indies]] bypassing the Chesapeake Bay. &lt;ref name=&quot;Hopkins (Britannica)&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/271525/Esek-Hopkins A Biography of Commodore E. Hopkins (Britannica)]&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins's orders made strategic sense.&lt;ref name=Millet/&gt; Since rebel warships were already active off the New England coast, and the [[w:Middle Colonies|Middle Colonies]] were forming their own [[w:coast guard|coastal defense navies]], he ultimately knew that the American colonies desperately needed gunpowder. He decided to attack the island of [[w:New Providence|New Providence]] in the [[w:Bahamas|Bahamas]] to capture a large supply of that commodity as well as a great quantity of other military supplies reportedly stored there. On the morning of 3 March, Hopkins captured [[w:Fort Montague|Fort Montague]] in the bloodless [[w:battle of Nassau|battle of Nassau]], in which Continental marines under Capt. Samuel Nicholas conducted their ''first'' [[w:amphibious warfare|amphibious operation]].

====Battle of Nassau====

Arriving in the [[w:Caribbean|Caribbean]], Commodore Esek Hopkins's main Continental fleet—and Captain Samuel Nicholas's Continental marines—reached [[w:Abaco Islands|Abaco]] in the [[w:Bahamas|Bahamas]], on the evening of 1 March 1776; the next day, Hopkins began laying plans for the raid on [[w:New Providence|New Providence]]. On 3 March 1776, the Continental Marines made their ''first'' epitomized amphibious landing in American history when they attempted an amphibious assault during the [[w:Battle of Nassau|Battle of Nassau]]. USS ''Wasp'' and USS ''Providence'' covered the marines as they went ashore to assault the British [[w:Fort Montagu|Fort Montagu]] hoping to seize supplies and provisions—of 234 of marines, and some fifty seamen—but their guns never fired because the landing force found the beaches unopposed. Because the landing went forward several miles to the east of the town, it caused them to fail in achieving a surprise attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevMarines&quot;&gt;

The following morning [4 March], they marched to [[w:Fort Nassau|Fort Nassau]] to seize more shots, shells, and cannons. However, the failure of surprise the day before had warned the defenders and allowed British Governor [[w:Montfort Browne|Montfort Browne]] to escape with a merchantman ship to [[w:St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine, Florida]], leaving all but 24 casks of powder out of the 174. And from other military stores captured, the marines and sailors took a large quantity of cannons—close to 90 pieces, and 15 brass mortars. .&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; However, the cache had more than justified the enterprise. Hopkins's fleet remained at Nassau for about two weeks loading the booty of war. So large was the take that several local ships had to be pressed into service to carry the materiel back to [[w:New England|New England]]. These acquired [[w:matériel|matériels]] were essential to the supply armament of the Continental Army. USS ''Fly'' was able to rejoin the squadron off New Providence 11 March—although  USS ''Hornet'' remained behind—finding that the operation had been a great success, and that a large quantity of military stores sorely needed had already been acquired and loaded. After the marines and sailors stripped the forts of their guns and all remaining ordnance, Commodore Hopkins finally hoisted sail on 17 March and withdrew from New Providence, hoisted sail and set course back north toward the Atlantic seas.  USS ''Andrew Doria'' became the fleet's [[w:hospital ship|hospital  ship]] after the other ships had an outbreak of smallpox. USS ''Andrew Doria'' was not affected as its crew had been inoculated.&lt;ref name=Hoffman&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 
USS ''Wasp'', however, parted with the main fleet and made her way independently back to the [[w:Delaware Capes|Delaware capes]] and thence into port at [[w:Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], where it arrived on 4 April.

====USS ''Alfred''—HMS ''Glasglow''====
Returning from the Nassau expedition in the Bahamas, the flagship USS ''Alfred '' led the Commodore Hopkins's Continental fleet homeward from Nassau harbor on 17 March 1776; the same day British troops were evacuating Boston. Hoping to catch more easy prizes, on the evening of 4 April, Hopkins sailed inbound to [[w:Block Island|Block Island]] in [[w:Rhode Island|Rhode Island]]. He encountered the British six-gun schooner [[w:HMS Hawk (1775)|HMS ''Hawk'']], and the next day [5 April], the eight-gun bomb brigantine [[w:HMS Bolton (1775)|HMS ''Bolton'']] while off [[w:Montauk Point State Park|Montauk point]],  [[w:Long Island|Long Island]]. The Continental sailors and marines boarded and seized both ships after a disgruntled close quarters fight, and claimed them as their [[w:prize (law)|prize]].

Shortly after midnight on 6 April, Hopkins encountered the [[w:frigate|frigate]] [[w:HMS Glasgow (1757)|HMS ''Glasgow'']], a 20-gun [[w:sixth-rate|sixth-rate]] warship under the command of navy captain [[w:Tryingham Howe|Tryingham Howe]]. While en route, HMS ''Glasgow'' was carrying dispatches of British troops that withdrawn from [[w:Newport, Rhode Island|Newport, Rhode Island]], and were sailing to meet the [[w:Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] fleet awaiting off the coast of [[w:Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston, South Carolina]]. This fleet had been assembled to launch an assault against the American forces in Charleston, which later it ultimately failed in the [[w:Battle of Sullivan's Island|Battle of Sullivan's Island]] on 28 June 1776. A fierce cannonade was exchanged between the American small flotilla and the British ship ''Glasgow'' and its destroyer tenders; despite the superiority in gunnery and seamanship, after and hour, HMS ''Glasgow'' managed to effectively escape from the heavy-laden American ships. Also, the Americans aimed their cannons too high, injuring only the sails and rigging. After dawn, HMS ''Glasgow'' disappeared over the horizon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hopkins (Britannica)&quot;&gt;
[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/271525/Esek-Hopkins A Biography of Commodore E. Hopkins (Britannica)]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of Hopkins ships in the fleet did attempt to chase however, the cannonade had cut the tiller ropes of USS ''Alfred'', leaving Hopkins' flagship unable to maneuver or to pursue the fleeing British ship. The USS ''Andrew Doria'' also sustained damage and was in need of repairs. Hopkins quickly became reluctant over his decision to chase HMS ''Glasgow'' due to the situation and continued to [[w:New London, Rhode Island|New London, Rhode Island]]. Four Marines wounded and seven killed; Lieutenant John Fitzpatrick was the first Continental marine killed in combat.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt;

He formed his squadron into a scouting formation of two columns: the right (eastern) column was headed by the USS ''Cabot'', followed by Hopkins' flagship, the USS ''Alfred''; and the left (western) column was headed by the USS ''Andrew  Doria'', followed by the USS ''Columbus''; behind these came the USS ''Providence'', with USS ''Fly'' and USS ''Wasp'', trailing further behind as escorts for the prizes.
Hopkins's squadron reached [[w:New London, Connecticut|New London]] on 8 April 1776.

After refitting the damaged ships in his fleet, Commodore Hopkins then proceed to Block Island, reaching it by 16 April 1776, with six of his warships, and his four small prize ships.&lt;ref&gt;

On the banks of [[w:Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], USS ''Andrew Doria'' captured two armed transports filled with soldiers, and made prizes of so many merchantmen that when he returned to the Delaware. Biddle retained but five of his original crew, the rest having been placed on board prizes.

===Interim: March–December 1776===
As the Commander-in-Chief Esek Hopkins's Continental fleet sailed on its maiden voyage for [[w:New Providence|New Providence]], in the [[w:Bahamas|Bahamas]]; in February, the [[w:Marine Committee|Marine Committee]] fitted out other Continental vessels, two brigantines —the [[w:USS Lexington (1776)|USS ''Lexington'']] and [[w:USS Reprisal (1776)|USS ''Reprisal'']], of 16-guns each; and the sloops [[w:USS Independence (1776 sloop)|USS ''Independence'']] and [[w:USS Sachem (1776)|USS ''Sachem'']], of 10-guns each; and [[w:USS Mosquito (1775)|USS ''Mosquito'']] of 4-guns. These ships cruised along the littoral edge of the [[w:Middle Colonies|Middle Colonies]].

====USS ''Lexington''—HMS ''Edward''====
On 26 March 1776, Captain [[w:John Barry (naval officer)|John Barry]] was issued orders from the [[w:Marine Committee|Marine Committee]] to sail his seamen and Continental marines aboard the USS ''Lexington'' and [[w:USS Wasp (1775)|USS ''Wasp'']] (commandeered by [[w:William Hallock (naval officer)|William Hallock]]) down the [[w:Delaware River|Delaware River]] to dispose the British frigate [[w:HMS Roebuck (1774)|HMS ''Roebuck'']] that was recently sighted offshore the  [[w:Delaware Capes|capes of Delaware]].&lt;ref&gt;

HMS ''Edward'' is a [[w:destroyer tender|destroyer tender]] for the British [[w:man-of-war|man-of-war]] [[w:HMS Liverpool (1758)|HMS ''Liverpool'']]. After a desperate fight—of one hour and twenty minutes—between the American and British forces, the American sailor and marines eventually overwhelmed the British, HMS ''Edward'' finally  [[w:Striking the colors|struck her colors]]. This event became the American navy's ''first'' victory over a British warship. USS ''Lexington'' sailed back for repairs. April 7, in sight of the [[w:Virginia Capes|Virginia capes]], Captain John Barry of the USS ''Lexington'' reported to the Marine Committee:
:&quot;I have the pleasure to acquaint you that at one P.M. this day I fell in with the sloop ''Edward'', belonging to the ''Liverpool'' frigate. She engaged us near two glasses. They killed two of our men and wounded two more. We shattered her in a terrible manner, as you will see. We killed and wounded several of her crew. I shall give you a particular account of the powder and arms taken out of her, as well as my proceedings in general. I have the happiness to acquaint you that all our people behaved with much courage.&quot;—Pennsylvania Gazette, April 17, 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Am. Arch., IV, v, 810, V, ii, 823; Almon, iii, 81; Griffin's Life of Barry, 30; Barney, 45, 46; N. E. Chronicle, April 25, 1776&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the ship was refitted, Captain John Barry (USS ''Lexington'') sailed back out to sea on 26 April.

====USS ''Lexington''—HMS ''Roebuck''====
While sailing the Delaware Capes, on 5 May 1776, Captains John Barry (USS ''Lexington'') and William Hallock (USS ''Wasp''), and its destroyer tenders, encountered [[w:Sir Peter Parker, 1st Baronet|Sir Peter Parker's]] fleet of two British men-of-war, the 44-gun HMS ''Roebuck'' and 28-gun HMS ''Liverpool'', escorted by a number of tenders and prizes, which were sailing to attack [[w:Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston, South Carolina]]. In the past, they had been raiding colonies, destroying tobacco farms, blockading merchants, in an effort to disrupt the commerce that helps finance the American Revolutionary War. The British fleet, having the advantage in fire superiority gave chase after eight hours of close-proximity cannonade. However, Captain Barry (USS ''Lexington'') finally managed to escape his pursuers and Captain Hallock (USS ''Wasp'') retreated into [[w:Christiana River|Christiana Creek]]. The HMS ''Roebuck'' was considerably injured in her rigging and, in attempting to get near the galleys, grounded on a shoal; the HMS ''Liverpool'' anchored near by for her protection. USS ''Reprisal'' and USS ''Hornet'' was in the bay nearby, although they took no part in the action, may have contributed to the discomfort of the Englishmen's situation.&lt;ref&gt;Am. Arch., IV, vi, 395, 408, 498, 809-811; Almon, iii, 173; Boston Gazette, May 20, 1776 ; Barney, 40-43; Wallace's Life of Bradford, 367.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the night, on 8 May, USS ''Roebuck'' finally cast off and the British dropped down the river. Captain Hallock (USS ''Wasp'') slipped back out of Christiana Creek, joining Captain Barry (USS ''Lexington''); both sailed out to join below [[w:Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester]] by thirteen Pennsylvania navy galleys.  The galleys followed and another action took place, an engagement that lasted all the afternoon. An American prisoner, impressed on board the HMS ''Roebuck'', says that the galleys:
:&quot;…attacked the men-of-war the second day with more courage and conduct [and] the ''Roebuck'' received many shots betwixt wind and water; some went quite through, some in her quarter, and was much raked fore and aft… During the engagement one man was killed by a shot which took his arm almost off. Six were much hurt and burned by an eighteen-pound cartridge of powder taking fire, among whom  was an acting lieutenant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Am. Arch., IV, vi, 810.]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ensuing engagement, Capt. Hallock's seamen and the  Continental marines captured the British brigantine HMS ''Betsey''. The British ships then retreated. In his official report to the admiral the captain of the HMS ''Roebuck'' says:
:&quot;On the 5th of May I took the ''Liverpool'' with me, sailed up the River as far as Wilmington, where I was attacked in a shallow part of the River by thirteen Row Gallies attended by several FireShips and Launches, which  in two long Engagements I beat off and did my utmost to destroy… After having fully executed what I had in view, I returned to the Capes the 15th.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brit. Adm. Rec., A. D. 487, November  28, 1776.&lt;/ref&gt;

An evening later, lightning  struck the USS ''Lexington'', forcing the ship to return home for repairs. Captain Barry and Captain William Hallock took their ship prizes into Philadelphia to be fitted for naval service in the Continental navy, arriving on 26 September 1776.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Two days later, Captain John Barry relinquished his command of the USS ''Lexington''.

====USS ''Lexington''—''Lady Susan''====
On 10 July 1776, the USS ''Lexington'', commandeered by  sailed out to sea. On the 27 July, USS ''Lexington'' encountered the [[w:privateer|privateer]] ''Lady Susan'' from [[w:Lord Dunmore|Lord Dunmore's]] [[w:Tory|tory fleet]], which had been operating in and out of the [[w:Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake Bay]]. ''Lady Susan'' was commanded by William Goodrich, a member of the notorious Tory family who had been harassing the merchant water routes of the colonies of [[w:Colony of Virginia|Virginia]] and [[w:Colony of Maryland|Maryland]]. Seven crew members from the captured privateer signed on for service with the Continental navy aboard USS ''Lexington''; one of the volunteers was [[w:Richard Dale|Richard Dale]] becoming Capt. Barry's [[w:midshipman|midshipman]], who later won fame under [[w:John Paul Jones|John Paul Jones]].

====Pennsylvania ''Nancy''—HMS ''Kingfisher''====
The Continental marines aboard Captain [[w:Lambert Wickes|Lambert Wickes]]'s [[w:USS Reprisal|USS ''Reprisal'']] sailed the [[w:Delaware River|Delaware River]], and its approaches; and had been assisting other Continental vessels in service, for a few months seeing no sea battles until May 1776, when two British frigates were raiding [[w:Colony of Pennsylvania|colony of Pennsylvania's]] system of forts, barriers, and small warships created by the [[w:Pennsylvania Committee of Safety|Pennsylvania Committee of Safety]].&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;

The ''Reprisal'' and USS ''Lexington'' came to help aid ''Nancy's'', while under cover of a fog she was run ashore near Cape May, as its captain made an attempt to save the ship's precious cargo.  As the fog soon lifted, they seen British  sending in boats. Under fire, both, all four Continental vessels concentrated their cannons and musketry in preventing the British crew of [[w:HMS Kingfisher (1770)|HMS ''Kingfisher'']] from boarding ''Nancy''. During the engagement, the Continental marines and sailors mounted a gun on shore and opened fire on the men-of-war. Captain Wickes's third-lieutenant and brother [[w:Richard Wickes|Richard Wickes]], lost his life during the fight.&lt;ref&gt;

The gunpowder was rowed ashore during the night, by morning the Americans left about 100 barrels of powder in the hold. Captain USS ''Nancy's'' captain and crew then set the brig on fire, with a large quantity of powder being still on board. The ship exploded as the British troops were boarding the brig ''Nancy'':
:&quot;and took possession of her with three cheers; soon after which the fire took the desired effect and blew the pirates forty or fifty yards into the air and much shattered one of their boats under her stern. Eleven dead bodies have since come on shore with two gold-laced hats and a leg with a garter. From the great number of limbs floating and driven ashore it is supposed thirty or forty of them were destroyed by the explosion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Am. Arch., V, i, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the British have another account of the incident:
:&quot;…boarded amidst a heavy fire from the shore, where thousands of people  had assembled to protect her. Finding it impossible to get her  off, we set her on fire, with orders to quit her without loss of time, as we found her cargo consisted of three hundred and sixty barrels of powder with some saltpeter and dry goods; but unfortunately, before we had all left her, she blew up and a mate and six men was blown to pieces in her. The oars of the other boats were all knocked to atoms and two men had their ribs broke; but considering the whole, we was amazingly fortunate, as the pieces of the vessel was falling all round for some time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Navy Rec. Soc., vi, 35, Journal of Lieutenant James&lt;/ref&gt;

====USS ''Reprisal''—HMS ''Shark''====

Captain Wickes, and the Continental sailors and marines of USS ''Reprisal'' cleared  [[w:Delaware Capes|Delaware Capes]] with thirteen merchantmen flanking at a safe distance; in the voyage they took and manned three prizes with sailors and marines, which left Captain Wickes'w fleet spread too thin while being very short-handed.

beating the British off and escaping into port. Captain Chapman of the HMS ''Shark'' says that at half-past five that afternoon a ship was seen coming around the northern point of the bay and was suspected of being an American. At seven the  HMS ''Shark'' slipped her cables and made sail. Half an hour later the USS ''Reprisal'' attacked.
:&quot;We wore and stood towards him &amp; haild him twice in French, to which he made no answer; we afterwards haild him in English, he continued to make sail from us &amp; made no reply. At 9 fir'd a shot ahead of him and haild in English, told him we was an English Man of War; he made no answer, but bore down and fired a Broadside into us, which we returned immediately and continued engaging 1/2 an hour, then he back'd his Maintops &amp; dropt astern &amp; afterwards tack'd; 1/4 past 10 we tack'd &amp; stood towards him, at 1/2 past 10 they fired two shot at us from the shore, which occasioned us to bear away; he kept his Wind and anchord in the Bay.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Brit. Adm. Rec., Captain's  Logs, No. 895 (log of the Shark.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wickes says that be replied to both the French and English hail of the HMS ''Shark'' and that the latter fired a shot at ten o'clock followed by three others in succession, to which the USS ''Reprisal'' returned four, whereupon the English made sail in order to withdraw from the contest. A French officer on shore thought that the English fire was the more rapid and better delivered. He says that after parting from the USS ''Reprisal'', the HMS ''Shark'' chased a schooner, which took refuge under a battery; whereupon the battery fired two shots at the HMS ''Shark''. The next day they returned to their anchorage in the harbor.

====USS ''Lexington''—HMS ''Pearl''====
With USS ''Lexington's'' repairs completed, Capt. William Hallock as its new commander sailed for [[w:Cap-Haïtien|Cap-Français]] (Cape Francois) to obtain a military cargo. On the return voyage, British frigate HMS ''Pearl'' overhauled the brigantine just short of the Delaware Capes, on 20 December, and captured her. The commander of the frigate removed USS ''Lexington’s'' officers but left 70 of her men on board under hatches with a prize crew. By luring their captors with a promise of rum, the Yankee sailors recaptured the ship and brought her to [[w:Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore, Maryland]].

===USS ''Andrew Doria''—HMS ''Racehorse'', 1776===
Under order of the [[w:Secret Committee|Secret Committee]], Captain [[w:Isaiah Robinson|Isaiah Robinson]] sailed the Continental navy brigantine [[w:USS Andrew Doria  (1775)|USS ''Andrew Doria'']] down the [[w:Delaware River|Delaware River]], on 17 October, for a [[w:Caribbean|Caribbean]] voyage to the [[w:Netherlands Antilles|Netherlands Antilles]] in the [[w:West Indies|West Indies]]. [[w:Second Continental Congress|Continental Congress]] issued authorization for the [[w:Marine Committee|Marine Committee]] to obtain a cargo of munitions and military supplies from the Dutch island [[w:Sint Eustatius|Sint Eustatius]]. Since the island sold [[w:weapon|weapons]] and [[w:ammunition|ammunition]] to anyone willing to pay, the island was one of the few ways to obtain [[w:matériel|matériels]] for [[w:George Washington|General Washington]]'s [[w:Continental Army|Continental army]]; also the commerce established good relations between Sint Eustatius and the [[w:Thirteen Colonies|United Colonies]].

Upon arrival on 16 November 1776, USS ''Andrew Doria'' fired its cannon a [[w:11-guns salute|11-guns salute]]; the Dutch governor [[w:Johannes de Graaff|Johannes de Graaff]] of Sint Eustatius decided to return the salute fire from Fort Oranje, rendering the foreign military ''first'' gun salute to an American [[w:Guidon (United_States)|guidon]] flying aboard an American naval ship, while anchored in a foreign port. Although the Dutch government later denied acknowledgment of the affair due to complaints by the British. However Governor Johannes de Graaff later recalled the statement. When the brig had loaded her cargo, she got underway for [[w:New England|New England]].

On 15 November 1776, while sailing past [[w:Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]] on her homeward voyage, USS ''Andrew Doria'' encountered the [[w:Royal Navy|Royal Navy's]] 12-gun [[w:sloop-of-war|sloop-of-war]] [[w:Surprise  (1777)|HMS ''Racehorse'']]. The sailors and marines fought for two-hour battle until they force the British to [[w:Striking the colors|strike their colors]] (or surrender). Robinson placed a crew of seamen and marines aboard the captured prize with orders to take her to back to [[w:Philadelphia|Philadelphia]], reaching it by January 1777.

===Princeton, 1777===
In late November 1776, [[w:George Washington|General Washington's]] Continental army positions along the [[w:Hudson River|Hudson River]] collapsed from the concurring assaults of British forces. In emergency response Washington requested assistance of a brigade of Philadelphia militia, a company of local seamen, and Major Nicholas's four companies of Continental marines. George Washington wrote a staunchly letter to [[w:John Cadwalader (general)|John Cadwalader]], a brigadier general of the [[w:Pennsylvania Associators|Pennsylvania Associators]]:
:''&quot;...if they came out resolved to act upon Land...instead their Services to the Water only.&quot;''—George Washington to John Cadwalader, 7 December 1776

On 2 December 1776, Major Samuel Nicholas and his three of his available companies—other two being Isaac Craig's and Robert Mullan's companies—of marines, garrisoned at the [[w:Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, Pennsylvania|Marine barracks]] in [[w:Philadelphia|Philadelphia]], were tasked to reinforce Washington's retreating army from [[w:New York|New York]] through [[w:Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], to slow the progress of British troops that were moving southward through [[w:New Jersey|New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt; The Major Nicholas and his companies of marines marched off to aid in support an American army for the first time in history; he led a battalion of 130 officers and enlisted men from Philadelphia, &lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt; leaving behind one company to man the Continental vessels. Unsure what to do with the marines, Washington requested that the marines be attached to a brigade militiamen from the Philadelphia Associators, in which were also dressed in green uniforms alike of the Continental marines. Thus, Nicholas and his marines joined Calwalader's brigade of Pennsylvania Associators, a force of 1,200 men. The marines lived side-by-side with the militia brigade in [[w:Bristol, Pennsylvani|Bristol, Pennsylvania]] for two weeks waiting for an attack from the British. However, the British army instead went into winter quarters along the New Jersey shore of the [[w:Delaware River|Delaware River]].&lt;ref name=Millet/&gt;

General Washington attack the German garrison at Trenton on 25 December, though Calwalader's brigade (including the Continental marines under Samuel Nicholas) were unable to arrive in time to affect the [[w:battle of Trenton|battle for Trenton]], due to problems crossing the ice-choked Delaware River. Cadwalader finally crossed the river on 27 December on his own initiative, reaching Trenton by 2 January as Washington concentrated his army.&lt;ref name=Millet/&gt; As Cadwalader and his brigade managed to reach Trenton on 2 January from across the Delaware River, the Continental marines watched the cannonade between the Continental Army and [[w:Lord Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]]' British Army at [[w:Assunpink Creek|Assunpink Creek]]. The marines helped defend a crucial bridge against a [[w:Battle of Trenton#Hessian moves|Hessian attack]].&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt;
&lt;ref name=&quot;RevMarines&quot;/&gt;

On the night of 3 January, Calwalader's brigade (including Major Nicholas's battalion of Continental marines) and General Washington's Army silently departs the battlefield and marches toward [[w:Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]]. By daybreak, they launched a two-pronged attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevMarines&quot;/&gt; The first prong of attack, led by Brigadier General [[w:Hugh Mercer|Hugh Mercer]], a close friend of George Washington, attacked a British stronghold. Mercer's brigade ran into heavy, well-disciplined musketry of two British regiments  
that were emplaced in front of Princeton, Mercer's brigade position soon collapsed.&lt;ref name=Millet/&gt; Calwalader's brigade (and marines) came to the assistance, but too stumbled into the British infantry forcing them to fall back. The second prong of attack caught the British in open flank, scattering three British regiments. It gave Washington's forces the advantage to take Princeton.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 
The battle for Princeton was the first engagement that the Continental marines fought and died in battle.

On 4 January, the remaining three marine companies encamped at its winter quartering at [[w:Sweets Town|Sweets Town]], not far from Washington's bivouac at [[w:Jockey Hollow|Jockey Hollow]], [[w:Morristown, New Jersey|Morristown]] in New Jersey. From 1 February 1777 and throughout the winter, the two companies of Nicholas's and Craig's marines either transferred to Morristown to assume the roles in the Continental artillery batteries, or left the service altogether.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt; Robert Mullan and his company went back to Philadelphia, only to find that they no longer have a ship to serve aboard.&lt;ref name=Millet/&gt;

===St. Mary’s Isle–Whitehaven, 1778===
On 23 April 1778, [[w:John Paul Jones|John Paul Jones]] and the Continental sailors and marines aboard [[w:USS Ranger (1777)|USS ''Ranger'']] made a raid on the British port of [[w:Whitehaven|Whitehaven, Great Britain]]. The seamen of USS ''Ranger'' set fire to ships and spiked the cannon of the fort. Later that same day, they land on [[w:St. Mary Isle|St. Mary Isle]] to capture a British earl, but find him away from home, and instead they take the family silver. The next day [24 April], USS ''Ranger'' and her marines defeat the British sloop HMS ''Drake'' in the [[w:Irish Sea|Irish Sea]].&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt;

===Lake Ponchartrain, 1778===
On 10 January, a company of Marines under Navy Captain [[w:James Willing|James Willing]] depart [[w:Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt, Pennsylvania]] for an expedition, in the armed boat USS ''Rattletrap''.  They sail into the [[w:Ohio River|Ohio River]] en route to [[w:New Orleans|New Orleans]].

Captain Willing and the Marines from USS ''Rattletrap'' captured the British sloop [[w:USS Morris (1778)|HMS ''Rebecca'']] while sailing down the [[w:Mississippi River|Mississippi River]].  They were able to temporarily weaken the British hold on the waterway from occupation. They raided British [[w:Loyalist|Loyalist]] plantations along on the shore of [[w:Lake Ponchartrain|Lake Ponchartrain]]. Marines from the frigate [[w:USS Randolph (1776)|USS ''Randolph'']] help extinguish a huge blaze on 15 January in [[w:Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston, South Carolina]], that destroyed hundred of buildings. They seized the forts, and captured five ships in the harbor.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt;

A group under Navy Captain James Willing left [[w:Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]], traveled down the [[w:Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[w:Mississippi River|Mississippi Rivers]], and captured a prize ship, which later becomes known as [[w:USS Morris (1778)|USS ''Morris'']] in the Continental Navy&lt;ref&gt;

===Penobscot, 1779===
Continental Marines landed and briefly captured [[w:Castine, Maine|Nautilus Island and the Majabagaduce peninsula]] in the [[w:Penobscot Expedition|Penobscot expedition]] in 1779, but withdrew with heavy losses when Commodore [[w:Dudley Saltonstall|Dudley Saltonstall]]'s force failed to capture the nearby fort.&lt;ref&gt;

====Isaac Craig's Company====
:Isaac Craig was born in Ireland about 1741, and moved to America in 1765 or 1767. He was a master carpenter and resided in the south part of the dock ward-city of Philadelphia. One source says he had a militia command prior to commission in continental Marines, but this is not proven.

The continental Navy brigantine, the [[w:USS Andrew Doria (1775)|USS ''Andrew Doria'']], Lt. Isaac Craig and his men, served on board the USS ''Andrew Doria'' from December 1775 through September 21st, 1776. They sailed for New Providence in February and took part in the raid in March.

He was commissioned a Captain on October 22nd, 1776 for service on the galley USS ''Champion''. They made only one cruise, returning in November of 1776.

Craig and his men were sent as part of a small battalion of Marines under command of Samuel Nicholas with Captain Craig as his adjutant. In December, these Marines joined Colonel Cadwalder at Burlington, New Jersey. They participated in the Battle of Assunpink Creek (second battle of Trenton) and the Battle of Princeton, January 2nd and 3rd, 1777. In February of 1777 Craig’s company of Marines were assigned to the Artillery at Morristown.

It wasn't until the year 1777 that the Marines entirely appeared in uniform in numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevMarines&quot;/&gt;
Though legend attributes the green color to the traditional color of riflemen, Continental Marines mostly carried muskets. More likely, green cloth was simply plentiful in Philadelphia, and it served to distinguish Marines from the blue of the Army and Navy or the red of the  
British.&lt;ref&gt;

== Preface ==

'''Formal Definition:''' A complex number is a number comprising a real and imaginary part (&lt;math&gt; z = x +yi &lt;/math&gt;), where x and y are real numbers, and i is the standard imaginary unit with the property &lt;math&gt;i^2 = -1, i = \pm \sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, a property that has led the the discovery of the fundamental theorem of algebra. The complex number field (&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R} \in \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;) is a superset of the real number field.

'''Translation:''' i represents numbers that don't exist, and acts as a convenient placeholder, thus allowing one to get the roots of any polynomial. The fundamental theorem of algebra states that any polynomial as the same number of roots, as its highest power. All complex numbers are examples of vectors on a different plane, commonly called an Argand diagram.

'''Formal Definition:''' In mathematics, the complex plane, z-plane,  Argand diagrams are a geometric representation of the complex numbers established by the real axis and the orthogonal imaginary axis. It can be thought of as a modified Cartesian plane, with the real part of a complex number represented by a displacement along the x-axis, and the imaginary part by a displacement along the y-axis.

'''Translation:''' All complex numbers are vectors, they have direction, magnitude, and can be displayed using Cartesian-like coordinates on a modified Cartesian plane, or can be manipulated in polar form. Common formations are rays (angles), circles, ellipses, and other common Cartesian graphs.

== Preface ==

'''Formal Definition:''' In mathematics, differential calculus is a subfield of calculus concerned with the study of how functions change when their inputs change. The primary object of study in differential calculus is the derivative. A closely related notion is the differential. The derivative of a function at a chosen input value describes the behavior of the function near that input value. For a real-valued function of a single real variable, the derivative at a point equals the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. In general, the derivative of a function at a point determines the best linear approximation to the function at that point.

'''Translation:''' Its all about gradients, tangents, normals, finding turning points, and the nature of turning points - fast.

== Preface ==

'''Formal Definition:''' Integration is an important concept in mathematics and, together with differentiation, is one of the two main operations in calculus. Given a function ƒ of a real variable x and an interval [a, b] of the real line, the definite integral is defined informally to be the net signed area of the region in the xy-plane bounded by the graph of ƒ, the x-axis, and the vertical lines x = a and x = b.

: &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b \! f(x)\,dx \,&lt;/math&gt;

'''Translation:''' Its all about finding the equation of higher level graphs and the areas of lower level ones - fast.

The '''[[w:military history|history]] of the [[w:United States Marine Corps|United States Marine Corps]]''' began with the founding of the [[w:Continental Marines|Continental Marines]] in [[w:1775|1775]] to conduct ship-to-ship fighting, provide shipboard security and discipline enforcement, and assist in landing forces. Its mission evolved with changing military doctrine and foreign policy of the [[w:United States|United States]]. Owing to the availability of Marine forces at sea, the United States Marine Corps has served in nearly every conflict in [[w:History of the United States|United States history]]. It attained prominence when its theories and practice of [[w:amphibious warfare|amphibious warfare]] proved prescient, and ultimately formed a cornerstone of the [[w:Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific Theater]] of [[w:World War II|World War II]].

By the early [[w:20th century|20th century]], the Marine Corps would become one of the dominant theorists and practitioners of amphibious warfare. Its ability to [[w:rapid deployment force|rapidly respond]] on short notice to [[w:expeditionary warfare|expeditionary crises]] has made and continues to make it an important tool for [[w:foreign policy of the United States|American foreign policy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;forwardfromthesea&quot;&gt;{{cite paper|author=[[w:John Howard Dalton|John Howard Dalton]], [[w:United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]]; [[w:Jeremy Michael Boorda|Jeremy Michael Boorda]], [[w:Chief of Naval Operations|Chief of Naval Operations]]; [[w:Carl E.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Adding an application to the Audio category ==

'''In our case we will add din (music software) to the Applications Menu under xfce4:'''

First, create a .desktop file via Create Launcher (right click), one can assing an icon and then when finished, it will appear on our Desktop.

To have it showing up under the Audio menu entry then, simply copy it over to:

&lt;code&gt;/usr/share/applications&lt;/code&gt;

after that run this on a terminal:

&lt;code&gt;sudo update-menus&lt;/code&gt;

'''it will appear under the entry labeled: Other'''

To make it appear under the '''Audio''' entry simply edit the .desktop file and add the following line:

&lt;code&gt;Categories=Audio;AudioVideo;Music;&lt;/code&gt;

Re-run the update-menus command (as above).

That's all, took me a while to figure it out since the xfce4 methods are a bit of a mess.. Thanks krgn for the help.

      <comment>/* What each country had at the beginning of the war */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:USS Pennsylvania moving into Lingayen Gulf.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Five battleships following each other during the Battle of Leyte Gulf]]

'''Battleships''' are large, armored ships that can carry huge guns. They are the descendants of the sailing &quot;Ship of the Line&quot; (the line being the &quot;line of battle&quot;, so &quot;Line of Battle Ship&quot;). They played a major role in the war in the Pacific and Atlantic. By the end of the war, the aircraft carrier had made the battleship less useful, and apart from shore bombardment they were rarely used again. The last time a battleship fired its guns in anger was the first Gulf War in the 1990s.

==What is a battleship?==
As listed above, battleships are large, armored ships that can carry huge guns. Because of their large power, they were the cool toy that every country wanted one to show that '''they''' were the best. Of course, they cost a ''lot''. Because of the battleship's large size, it was the large bully of the sea. If the commanding country felt like it, it could send a battleship into the ocean to sink ships that were owned by other countries, only only other battleships could stop it.

==What each country had at the beginning of the war==
===The list===

|-

|-

|-
| Japan || '''14'''
|-
| Great Britain || '''19'''
|}
===Explanation===
If we look at this table, we see that the Great Britain has the most, with United States and Japan following it. Also, we see that Russia had very few battleships. Now for an explanation. Some countries, like the United States, Italy, Great Britain and France, had kept a bunch of old battleships that were too old fashioned for use in the war. Great Britain had '''13''' battleships built before 1925 and France had '''6''' that were very old. The U.S. was pretty much the same, but had a different story. After the Washington Naval Treaty (1922), which basically said that no country could have a lot of these ships, the U.S. stopped building battleships, and only started again in World War 2.  That's why '''15''' of the ships were old ones. The U.S. managed to build ten more during World War 2, but it was a close call. Italy, which had a smaller navy, only had 3 old ships. Meanwhile Japan had re-modernized each of their ships around 1930, so all of their ships were high-tech and ready to go. Russia's navy was pretty much destroyed at the Battle of Shiatsu in 1905, but they got a few ships on loan from other countries to help them. All we have left to explain is Germany. Before World War 1, Germany had a &quot;race&quot; with Great Britain to see who could build the best and most battleships. By World War One, it had become a tie. Some German ships were old, but the number was about the same as Italy had. Germany also had started to build larger battleships called the ''Spitz'' and ''Bismarck'' as well as some battle cruisers (called pocket-battleships, more on this later) that were already roaming the seas, ready to attack when war started.

==What stuff was on Battleships at this time?==
===The big guns===
Guns were the main thing on battleships. I mean, without guns, you can't do anything useful with a battleship. Most guns during this time were measured by the diameter of the shell, or hunk of metal they fired in inches. Common main guns were 14 and 16 inch guns, with 8 and 6 inch as &quot;backup&quot; guns and a bunch of 3 and 5 inch guns in case aircraft attacked. Now pause right here and go take out a yardstick and measure 14 inches. If you draw a circle that long, imagine what it was like to have those things, which were full of explosives crashing into ships. Not a very good sight. The shells of the largest guns weighed nearly 2 tons.

===Armor===
To protect from those shells, battleships, as all other ships, had to have armor. Armor for ships is just basically a large wall of metal &quot;hooked&quot; onto the ship to protect it from shells. This was also usually about 14 to 15 inches thick. Battleships also had to protect from torpedoes launched from submarines and destroyers, a topic explained later in this book. To do so, countries had to attach large semi-spheres of metal to battleships so as to stop that from happening. If armor was not used, than battleships would have been sunk in seconds after starting to fight with other battleships.

===Other Stuff===
Some battleships had space for accessories, which in this case was stuff like airplane launchers and radar towers. Radar towers were large masts which, when with a radar room in the ship that had a bunch of machines in it, could track whatever approached a set distance from the ship. If something came, crew would be given a warning and would stand ready. Nothing could sneak up on those things for a long while. Another thing added to some ships was an airplane catapult. This wasn't your old catapult of the Middle Ages, but rather a thing that pushed a plane forward very quickly, which could then take off and attack, sort of like a mini aircraft carrier.


==Battlecruiser (a.k.a.: Battleship-Lite, Pocket-Battleship)== 
The Battlecruiser, Pocket Battleship, or as we've nicknamed it in the title, Battleship-Lite, was a sort of mini battleship. It was fast enough to run away from anything that was bigger than it, but powerful enough to beat senseless anything that was quicker than it. The British and Germans had some at the beginning of World War One, and after that war ended, '''every''' country wanted to have them. They saw how cool they were, and they were anxious to get some. Germany and Britain both planned to have a lot, but because of the Washington Naval Treaty, those ships had to be canceled, but Britain did manage to build one battlecruiser. The Germans however &quot;worked around&quot; the Washington Naval Treaty by creating &quot;pocket-battleships&quot;, which were basically just battle-cruisers with a different name. Seeing that two countries already had some, the Russians, Americans and Japanese also wanted to have a fleet of battlecruisers. Japan was the only able to do so, since it built them during the 1930s, when no one cared anymore about the Naval Treaties. 

==What each Country planned to do with their battleships==
Each country knew that, in case of war, they had to have a plan, just like you should have a plan when you play chess or some other strategy game. Here's each group's plans:

===Allies===
[[File:Missouri panama canal.jpg|thumb|rgiht|250px| An example of a U.S. battleship passing through the Panama Canal. If the ship had been a bit wider, it would not have been able to move through.]]
Two Allied countries (France and Russia) had small navies, mainly because France's economy went whacko whenever they tried to build a large fleet, and Russia had a small group because, after the disaster at Tsushima (Russia vs. Japan battle in 1905), they did not have enough time to build a large navy before war started (in this case, World War 1 and 2). One thing Russia had a bit of luck with was that they only had one real main port, which was St. Petersburg (in World War 2 called Leningrad). So Russia used most of their fleet to set up a defensive barricade near Lenningrad, and they didn't have to worry about anything else. This was basically the same with the French. Their ships were old, but they had enough to defend each of their main ports. Of course, when Germans arrived and bombed them, the French didn't stay and fight, but ran. They got to a port in Africa, then joined the Germans. After that, they were bombed by British bombers. So, if we take out those two Allied navies, we have two left. Britain, which is an island, needed a navy as its main defensive weapon. If Britain did not have a navy, then it couldn't protect ships bringing in food and the people would starve.  This leaves the United States to explain. The U.S. was neither of the ones above, it was actually a large part of a continent and it had a large enough navy to make normal attack operations. The problem was this: How to connect the west and east coast of the country? You can't bring ships over land, so there had to be a water way connecting the two oceans. The answer? The Panama Canal, a canal built in 1914 across the tip of Mexico that connected the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. The problem was that the canal could only move ships that were a set width or less. Anything else would have to move all the way across the coast of South America, which was a ''' very''' long journey. Since the U.S. did not want these long journeys to take place, they had to rely on weaker ships to be able to defend both coasts of the country

===Axis===
Let's start with an explanation about Italy's plans.  Italy was mainly the &quot;little brother&quot; of Germany and Japan.  It had a weaker army and a weaker navy, although they had just built four new ships right before the beginning of the war.  Italy's main goals were African countries.  To capture those countries, they would need to have a troop launching pad, so as troops could sail across the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa.  For that, they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt.  Besides those actions, Italy's battleships were not supposed to do anything else.  Now for Japan.  Japan was an island country, just like Britain.  Unlike Britain, she was not really surrounded by any enemy country that had a good navy (Russia's was nearly destroyed and most of it was in the Baltic Sea, while the U.S. was a whole ocean away).  Japan could thus maneuver freely, destroying any ships that got in her way.  They also had large ships like the ''Yamato'' and ''Musashi'', which were super-heavy ships with large guns.  If the U.S. tried to build some, they would be too big to fit through the Panama Canal.  And now for Germany.  Germany is in a worse situation than Britain: it's close to '''3''' enemy countries (France, Britain, and Russia), and it's got only two or three seaports.  To fix this Germany had to capture more ports, which they did when they invaded Norway.  Before that, however, Germany already had some pocket-battleships roaming the seas, ready to strike.  They had gotten out between World War 1 and 2.  With that in mind, let's see if their plans worked out.

==The role of battleships in the War==
===First Shots===
Although Japan was fighting with China since 1937, World War 2 officially started on September 1st, 1939, when Adolf Hitler invaded Poland. One of the first battles was the Battle of Westerplatte, where an old German battleship named the SMS Schleswig-Holstein supported shock troopers with shell fire. After seven days of tough fighting, the garrison surrendered. The Schleswig-Holstein continued to provide fire support to other troops attacking Polish ports, and was hit by a 152 mm shell at the last one she attacked, Hel. This marked the first shore retaliation against a ship in World War 2.

===Graf Spee: High Seas Bully===
One of the Germans' pocket battleships was the ''Graf Spee''. The ''Graf Spee'' was in the South Atlantic when war started, and managed to sink '''9''' ships before the British chased her into Montiviedo, a harbor in Uruguay. After 72 hours of the British waiting for the Graf Spee to come out and fight, the captain of the Graf Spee decided that he would rather save all his men and loose his ship than loose all of both. So, thinking hits, he blew up the ''Graf Spee'', preventing the British from capturing her or sinking her.

==Introduction==

There have been a few  attempts at porting AROS (Amiga OS like) to the ARM architecture. At the moment, AROS runs on top of Linux (as well as [[Aros/Platforms/Installing_on_Android|Android]]) as another task/application. 


* 2006 year tech (ARMv5) : VIA 8500/8505, VIA 8650, RK2808/2818, Telechip 7801 (no support) 
* 2008 year tech (ARMv6) : Imap X2xx, Telechip 8902, Nvidia Tegra, Raspberry Pi, 
* 2010 year tech (one ARMv7) : Freescale iMX5, Marvell, Qualcomm, Samsung Hummingbird, TI OMAP 3xxx, Allwinner A10,  
* 2011 year tech (two ARMv7) : Nvidia Tegra 2, Qualcomm, Samsung Origen, ST-Ericsson, TI OMAP 4xxx, 
* 2012 year tech (3/4 ARMv7) : Nvidia Tegra 3, Qualcomm, Freescale iMX6, Samsung Exynos, 
* 2013 year tech ( ) : Qualcomm, Samsung, Tegra 4, 
* 2014 year tech (64bit) : AMD , 


Although ARMv6 chips have been around since late 2007, it is only since 2008 that Linux like  Ubuntu, Debian, Angstrom] and close cousin Android with JIT Dalvik VM bytecode or Java bytecode been placed on netbooks, smartbooks, phones and tablets to provide a choice to the closed commercial OS like WinCE,  Windows Mobile and BlackberryOS and in the past  SymbianOS (which is now open) and even the old Archimedes RISCOS. 



Support Chips 

An SOC is an integrated chip that includes a CPU, a GPU (graphics) and various task specific processors. 
The level of support is entirely based on the amount of information that is available. Support needs to include the core cpu itself (2D and 3D as well) and other extra motherboard chips like hdmi, lcd, touchscreen, dsp, sata, etc. which requires knowledge (datasheets) from the suppliers of those chips (audio and USB is the best that can be supported without it). To get some idea of the amount of information needed see the [http://www.rockbox.org/ Rockbox site for slightly simpler examples]. 


ARMHF target needs either armv7a cpu, if you are going to use both 32-bit arm code and thumb2, or armv6 cpu (that one was default, after you deleted this line) with 32-bit ARM code only (then gcc cross compiler needs --disable-multilib option).



GPUs

* nVidia's Custom GPU found in the Tegra 2 SOC - 71 million. This GPU's native support for Unreal Engine 3, OpenGL 2.0, and a dedicated processor for 1080p/HDMI output support.

* PowerVR SGX535 GPU - 28 million (triangles per second). This is the GPU found in the iPhone 4, iPad and most of Intel's Integrated Graphics Cards found in laptops (GMA 500/600). The iPhone 3GS also uses this GPU but clocked at a mere 200mhz. At that speed, it only pushes 7 million. 

* PowerVR SGX540 GPU - 90 million. This is the GPU found in the upcoming OMAP4 SOC, Snapdragon Gen II/III SOC and the Hummingbird SOC. The GPU in the Hummingbird SOC maxes out at 28 million due to it being clocked at 200 mHz and due to limitations related to the memory bandwidth. 

* PowerVR SGX554MP GPU - Unknown performance. It's a multicore gpu and thus the performance would scale based on the number of cores used. 

* GC800 single core Vivante GPU used by Marvell 

* GC1000  

* GC2000/GC4000 Marvell's Vivante GPU found in the Tri-Core Armada 628 SOC - Marvell claims that this GPU pushes a whopping 200 million triangles per second. As always, the actual devices will likely limit the clockspeed in order to conserve battery life so the real world performance will be less. 

* ARM Mali 200 GPU pushes 16 million triangles per second. 

* ARM Mali 400 GPU - This is the GPU found in the ST Ericsson U8500 SOC and the Samsung Orion SOC. This is a MP GPU that can scale anywhere from 1-4 cores. The rumours regarding the theoretical performance of the four core design range anywhere from 130 million to a whopping 450 million triangles per second. However, the key limitation as always is the clockspeed. A four core design could deliver very impressive performance even at a low clockspeed. 

* Mali T604

* [http://www.arm.com/products/multimedia/mali-graphics-hardware/mali-t658.php Mali-T658]  &quot;The Mali-T658 delivers desktop-class performance, achieved by doubling the number of GPU cores, doubling the number of arithmetic pipelines within each core and improving the compiler and pipeline efficiency.

The ARM Mali-T658 GPU supports multiple Compute APIs, including Khronos® OpenCL 1.1 (Full Profile), Google Renderscript compute and Microsoft DirectCompute. It provides native hardware support for 64-bit scalar and vector, integer and floating-point data types - fundamental to accelerate complex and computationally intensive algorithms. Complete support for Khronos APIs is maintained across the Mali-T600 Series of GPUs.

The Job Manager within Mali-T600 Series GPUs offloads task management from the CPU to the GPU and enables seamless load balancing across active shader cores. Concurrent delivery of a common set of compatible drivers for all Midgard architecture-based Mali GPUs enables faster time-to-market and minimizes software upgrade costs for future implementations.

The Mali-T658 GPU takes advantage of ARM CoreLink Cache Coherent Interconnect (CCI-400) technology, enabling faster and more efficient sharing of data with other processors in the system.

IAR have a free code size limited version. Keil are owned by ARM, so should provide good tools.
Code Red have excellent debug facilities (none intrusive trace, etc.) and the lowest price. 
Rowley and Code Red use CodeSourcery. Raisonance uses the arm-non-eabi CodeSourcery compiler too.

What the ideal developer board should have? 

* 2 serial ports (one can be null modem, second should have RTS/CTS/DTR lines)
* working Ethernet not placed on USB bus (so it works when USB does not)
* powered USB host port (more than one would be great)
* USB device port
* JTAG connector
* one power input — +5V or +12V 
* SD/MMC slot — even if it is over slow SPI 
* GPIO pins
* I²C bus
* SPI bus
* keypad with Up/Down/Left/Right + Enter at least
* easily reachable reset button (pins to short are acceptable as micro switch can be put on them)
* few LEDs controlled by system
* all connectors put on one or two edges of board — top one + one of side ones are ok 
* mounting holes (so board can be mounted for presentation) 
* backup battery for RTC
* U-Boot or similar 
* quite fresh kernel 

What to avoid:

* female serial port connectors  
* flat cables which connect “debug boards” with main board 
* RJ45 connectors for serial console — DB9 or properly done USB-&gt;RS232 adapter on-board are best
* placing connectors on all edges (BeagleBoard)
* non standard bootloaders (U-Boot is what I prefer)
* Ethernet on USB 
* jumpers 
* non standard connectors 

I am trying to not cover should developer board contain display with touchscreen or not as it depends on type of board. But if screen is present then more than QVGA (320×240) would be nice (WVGA 1200x768 anyone?). Some kind of video out connector can also be used but would be nice to have one of VGA/DVI/HDMI so normal PC monitor can be used — Composite video and S-Video require searching for some kind of TV.</text>

==Introduction==

AROS is meant to be an operating system compatible with AmigaOS at the SOURCE level, this way an Amiga program recompiled on AROS would gain the speedup of direct execution. The problem is that most amiga programs are available only in binary format for Motorola 68000 family, which means they can't run on x86 PC AROS directly. 

Amiga Forever is an emulation for other operating system, which means that all Amiga programs can run in a virtual replica of the original hardware and OS. 

What are the pros and the cons of those approaches?



'''AROS'''

PROS:
- future proof: system can be freely enhanced by anyone
- speed: a native application is faster than a emulated one
- portability

CONS:
- binaries can't run directly
- you won't play Sensible Soccer and Turrican II
- you've to pray your hardware is supported



'''AMIGA FOREVER'''

PROS:
- you can run your software flawlessly
- you can play Sensible Soccer and Turrican II

CONS:
- you'll be stuck to 68K software (no future proof)
- apps will run slower than if ported to AROS

As you can see, the best solution is... running Amiga Forever under AROS! 

So the solution, is to run Aros on it and then use Amibridge - best of both worlds. The two together are great but you really want around a 1GHz CPU to make a really good system.

Janus-UAE can be started in one window (normal mode like you would be running UAE under Windows/Linux) or it can be run so that AmigaOS 3.l windows are displayed as if they were AROS windows (coherency). 





==Janus UAE==

===Files needed===

* WB3.1 ADFs Workbench and Extras (commercial Cloanto Amiga Forever '''Amiga Files/Shared/''') or AROS Free [http://aros.sourceforge.net/nightly.php amiga-68k-boot] replacement Roms and Workbench Disk or

To create your own the ADF or DMS or write a ADF or DMS, normally you need to have a real AMIGA.

* AROS m68k install (free like [http://www.natami-news.de/html/aros_vision.html Aros Vision]) 



===Understanding JanusUAE GUI setup===

Under the Start, Stop, Reset, Quit buttons there are many tabs (some of which need to be completed straightaway and others later) 

* Floppy Disks ADFs - Insert WorkBench Disk into DF0 and Extras Disk into DF1 
* Memory - Insert Amiga Rom file here or in the case of AROS two files (if using Cloanto's Amiga Forever Roms insert the rom.key file at the bottom box) 
* CPU - Set to 68020 or higher if using WB3.1  Set 68000 if using WB1.3 or WB2.04 version 
* Hard Disks HDFs - only needed if using .hdf files - set priority to 1 so that it boots first 

Press Start button above

===Tips and hints===

Tips for better/less hassle install of Amiga Forever, I would recommend the following tweaks - at least this helped me a lot to reduce the crashes and issues:

Ctrl+Alt+Q will also quit the emulator 
Ctrl+Alt+R will soft reset 

Ctrl+alt+f1 lets you change disk in df0
Ctrl+alt+f2 lets you change disk in df1.
etc.

* Adjust your .uaerc config &quot;manually&quot;, especially if you want to play old tracker (med) files like me. Regarding sound and CPU, I adopted the file nikolaos posted [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=4927 here] or at the bottom of this page. I don't use the Amibridge config tool at the moment - too many freezes. 

* Delete the &gt;NIL: entry in the Workbench script like described  [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=4964 here]

* Then run the system with pre-configured GRUB line that includes the nodma option. I am not 100% sure about that, but it seems to make my system more stable, especially when it comes to my emulation issues.

* use uaequit to quit the emulation. I think I found it in an AmiKit version long ago. I add it to a &quot;System&quot; menu added through OS3.9 AddMenu ARexx command. There is also UAECtrl which can be found on the AmigaForever CD.

* edit the .uaerc file manually and got lots of drives. You can use the existing lines as a template on how to add additional drives.

* working just fine by copying all the OS3.5 files from the OS3.9 CD and then copying all of the OS 3.9 files from the same CD allowing it to overwrite the OS3.5 files it needed to. I then used DOpus AROS to mark all files as RWED.

the only way to improve audio performance was to remove &quot;Idle on STOP instruction&quot; from the CPU tab (ensure also that &quot;Maximum&quot; is set for the speed).

Don't try other CPUs than 68020 as they won't give you any real benefits in an emulated 68xxx CPU (AFAIK).

Then you might try reducing sound quality, channels and resolution in the &quot;Sound&quot; tab, of course you might get more 'fluid' playing at the cost of a worse quality.

Last... check also in the .config file for JUAE - look for the setting &quot;sound_frequency&quot; as by default is set to 11025 Hz. You might change it for example to CD quality 44100 - this might give a brighter sound quality




===Amibridge on Icaros===

You have two ways to start Amiga apps on Icaros 

* the old amibridge method - just let amibridge do what it has always done without integrating workbench into AROS screen

* launch straight from Workbench - You need to start workbench in the same way as before first, this to clean amigaos' S: from the amibridge.script files. 

Then


# open Sys:Prefs
# move &quot;AmiBridge&quot; icon to AmiStart, this will facilitate things in future
# launch AmiBridge
# start
# configure workbench to use a UAEGFX resolution EQUAL to the one of AROS
# in workbench, unpin the &quot;backdrop&quot; option to have workbench desktop shown in a window.
# resize wb window to include just the volume icons, snapshot window, snapshot all
# alt+tab to show JUAE panel
# go to Integration panel and enable everything
# enjoy




Works for me under Icaros 1.21 (using AmigaForever):
&lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot; &gt;
&lt;li&gt; run AROS in VESA 1024x768 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; start AmiBridge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; in Workbench (AmigaOS) change resolution to 1024x768, disable Backdrop, make window smaller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; press Alt+Tab (returns to AROS)&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; on Janus-UAE Integration tab set Coherency and Wanderer integration to Enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Now I can open Work partition (the one from AmigaOS), go to Software drawer, go to PPaint drawer, double-click PPaint.. and PPaint is loaded and ran on separate AROS screen.

==Amithlon==





===Hardware Support===

The 'easy' way to Amithlon is to build a dedicated system based on:

* nForce2 (200 or 400) based mobo. Turn OFF the sata in the bios. 
* VIA based KT-400 or KT-600 on Intel (single or dualcore) or AMD Socket A. 
* Intel ?

* Memory: Buy some DDR400+ ram &amp; overclock it!!! Seriously, this kind of emulation NEEDS fast memory. (Again you don't need more than 512mb - Amithlon won't support it without much faffing &amp; how much does an Amiga need?)



CPU - AMD Duron / Athlon (XP)(M) 
Mobo - nVidia NF2, VIA KT600 (DFI Ultra-B, Abit KV7, or similar)
RAM - Some quick DDR memory (DDR500+)
GFX - AGP GF4 Ti or GF5
Sound - SB 128 or !Live
LAN - at worst you'll need an el-cheapo PCI card if the mobo one doesn't work. 
USB - It's gonna work but sadly Poseidon doesn't support Amithlon any more.
TURN OFF SATA support in the BIOS!
SET GRUB to support a MAX of 512mb RAM (at least until it's working)


Dedicated Amithlon
MB: Asus K8N (nForce3-250) with Sempron 2800+, 1GB ram
HD/CD-rom: ATA
Net: MB built in works!
Sound: SB Audigy PCI
Graphics: AGP (see below)

HTPC
MB: Asus M2NPV-MX (nForce430) with Athlon X2 BE-2400, 1GB ram
HD/CD-Rom: SATA
Net: Realtek rtl8139 PCI
Sound: Nope.
Graphics: PCI-e (see below)

I have been spending more time messing around with Amithlon; this time on a system with a Celeron 2000, Matrox G4 450, SB Live!, and an RTL8139 ethernet adapter. Amithlon works very well on this configuration.

Mobo: DFI Ultra-B. (Abit KV7 is a great / suitable VIA-based mobo) with CPU: Athlon XP-M overclocked to 2.5gig and GPU: nVidia GeForce FX5200 or FX5500 (A full GF 4 is great too). 

Processor is pentium III, 667Mhz, 256MB sdram, 40gb ide drive. VIA Motherboard is DFI CA64 T, sound viaac97.





====Accelerated Gfx====

* NVidia TNT2
* NVidia GeForce SDR / DDR
* NVidia GeForce 2 / 2MX Full HW acceleration and surprisingly fast! 
* NVidia GeForce 4000 / 4MX
* NVidia GeForce 3 / 3 Ti Ti200 AGP: Full HW acceleration 
* Nvidia GeForce 4 Ti Ti4400 AGP: Full HW acceleration 
* Nvidia GeForce FX / FX Go / PCX
* Nvidia Geforce 6150 (integrated on MB): HW-acceleration works but no rasterscroll 
* Nvidia Geforce PCX 5300 PCI-e: HW-acceleration works but no rasterscroll 
* Nvidia GeForce 8400GS PCI-e: HW-acceleration works but no rasterscroll 

The missing rasterscroll acceleration have a very noticeable impact, it makes scrolling in a CLI-window unbearably slow (When the HW acceleration works it is lightning fast.). Not sure if this can  be fixed in the kernel or does the problem lie somewhere else? It would be wonderful to have it fixed (almost as good as breaking the 1GB barrier) because it would make a lot of graphic cards usable in one single stroke! 

* Matrox Millennium / G100 / G200 / G450 / G550

* ATI Radeon 7xxx
* ATI Radeon 8xxx
* ATI Radeon 9xxx

Opinion - All other cards will run in VESA VGA mode. If you are purchasing a card to use with Amithlon I strongly recommend picking a GeForce 4 Ti or GeForce FX card as these offer maximum performance and working DVI support.




====Audio====

Best sound option is a SB 128 or !Live - old but gold (and better than any Amiga sound card). 

* More AC97 audio codecs, including the popular ALC based chips.
* ATI/AMD based controllers in the SB400, SB600 and many others.
* Audio support functions in CMI8788-Oxygen HD Audio, Creative Labs SB X-Fi Sound Blaster Live!
* Sound controllers as Emagic Audiowerk 2 sound card, Vortex 3D Digital Audio, AU8820 Vortex and AU8810, ALi M5451 and others.



====Ethernet LAN====

* NVidia nForce based LAN adaptors, nForce 2-3-4. MCP51 nForce 430/410/405/400, MCP55 ...
* Intel LAN chips like 82801EB/ER (ICH5/ICH5R), Intel PRO/100 like 82801E Ethernet and Intel PRO/1000 PCI-Express Gigabit Ethernet adaptors.
* Realtek 8169 Gigabit Ethernet support.
* Many 3Com based network controllers, Typhoon, 3Com Etherlink and Broadcom Gigabit Ethernet adaptors.
* Marvell Yukon 2 Gigabit Ethernet support.
* and lots more...





===Booting===

Now you should boot with grub/lilo and with smallird.gz. It doesn't contain internal amithlon hd but it looks for amithlon's partition on actual hard drive to boot from. If with kernel310 system didn't find your &amp;76 partition on first boot, you can't boot with it now either. Use my kernel4 instead. You should copy kern310, kernel4 with the rest of the files to boot folder so when grub/lilo starts you can change the boot options on the fly.

 kernel /amithlon/kernel4 console_level=0 init=/linuxrc root=/dev/ram0 mem=768M vga=769 ramdisk_size=2310 leavepages=5200 cachesize=65536
 initrd /amithlon/smallird.gz



Let's go through those parameters...

emubox.gz init=/linuxrc console_level=4 root=/dev/ram0 initd=smallird.gz vga=769 ramdisk_size=2310 leavepages=5000.
-emubox.gz: The Amithlon Kernel you're using.
-init=/linuxrc: What kind of Kernel you're using.
-console_level=4: How much 'debug' info 0-&gt;4 (None-&gt;Lots).
-root=/dev/ram0: Where Amithlon keeps it's files - A RAM Disc.
-initd=smallird.gz: The system files Amithlon is to use.
-vga=769: The VESA mode Amithlon uses on boot-up.

Now it starts to get important...
-ramdisk_size=2310: The size of disc required to fit all of Amithon's working files. This tends to be larger with later kernels and much larger with BIGIRD.GZ as there has to be room for the internal AmigaOS install.
-leavepages=5000: Working memory needed by the Kernel itself. Again this tends to be larger for later versions.

So:
If you're using Gary's 3.10 Kernel you need to make sure:
-ramdisk_size=2310
-leavepages=5200
...If booting with SMALLIRD.GZ

and:
-ramdisk_size=12010
-leavepages=8200
...If booting with BIGIRD.GZ


There are other options that may (or may not!) help get Amithlon going.

-cachesize=65536: Is always worth adding to the end of your parameters line as it gives Amithlon's 68k JIT-compiler more memory to play with - make is faster!

-mem=512M: Is useful if you're running more than 1gb of RAM as this can stop Amithlon working. In your case this shouldn't be an issue as you have 256mb but mem=256M may be worth adding just in case.

Put the following right @ the end:
-video=dovesa: Can be very useful for forcing unsupported cards into VESA mode if they don't do VESA properly themselves.

-video=riva:640x480,flatpanel=1: May help get a nVidia card to do DVI with Amithlon or an unsupported nVidia card to do anything at all!

-video=radeon:640x480,dfp: Same kind of thing for ATi cards.

-video=matrox:vesa:0x11B,dfp video=dovesa: May give you dual-head support with all sorts of cards. More likely will stop Amithlon in it's tracks unless you're really using an old Matrox dual-head card.

There's a few other potentially useful options but I'm afraid I've forgotten them.





===Drivers===

There are two types of drivers you can use on Amithlon.

* Native Drivers (68k OS3.9 drivers) (mostly recommended if there is)
* Linux Side Kernel Drivers (Kernel Drivers) (better than nothing)

There is no written Native Drivers for your sound hardware yet. (sorry) But maybe there are Kernel Drivers for them. 

Kernel modules (drivers) work just the same as they work in Linux. You specify the apporpriate module for your hardware, and you insert the module into the kernel with insmod command. (INSert MODule - PCIinsmod on Amithlon). You reach the inserted module via amithlon.device from OS3.9 side. 

If you already have an pciinsmode command (without arguments) in your startup-sequence, it detects the hardware you have at startup and inserts the right modules automatically to your kernel. But if there are two hardware of the same type, modules will be inserted for both, and they will conflict. So you have to choose which one to use, and let insmod command to insert only the right one. (once a module is inserted, you have to HardReset your Computer to remove them)

Now go to your S: drawer and read the file &quot;pcimodules&quot;. Have a detailed look at the lists. Search for your hardware. If you can find the module for Ensoniq/5880 (well I don't think you will) and make sure it is inserted. And make sure your other hardware snd-intel8x0.o is not inserted. (you can query the inserted modules with xcat command. (You will have to search and read all the readme files carefully to learn how all these are done.)

To be realistic, you don't have much choice. It is best to use the hardware that works. By this I mean, if your o/b AC97 works, use it. Or buy a secondhand Vibra128 or SBLive!. They have native drivers.


Zip Drive
Make sure your Amithlon is patched with latest patches. Contrib2 (by Bernd Meyer) includes an experimental patch for Zip drives. Obtain it, read the readmes and learn installing/using it.

Network
Same issues apply with the previous posts. Learn the way Kernel drivers work. Examine the files S:Pci_modules and Devs:PciDrivers/... Look for modules that will be able to support your hardware. Once inserted succesfully, your network cards will be accessible via amithlon1_net.device.
If you cannot find any appropriate modules, try obtaining a supported NIC card (eg. Realtek RTL8139). They are not so expensive and not so hard to find.

Transfer files
After having a working network card, Samba will be your cure.




===Additional Installs===

Next to installed are...
PowerPCI and OpenPCI libraries. BoingBag1, BoingBag2, BB2Contributions, AmithlonUpdate and finally copied Drivers0.90 (from Gary Collive) to the appropriate drawers.

Take a look at contrib3b, the latest Hyperion update, and if you are running an Intel chip rather than AMD make sure the PIII patch is in your SPatches directory. Do you have amithlon_update installed, or contrib3b? Take a look in contrib3b readme to make sure all the required network and sound related files are there and at the proper place (they should be at exact locations). 

Look for a later version of P96. (beware the installer won't be Amithlon aware, so make sure you're only updating libs &amp; not settlings or drivers). 

Grab the rtg.lib from the latest stable WinUAE (helps with glitches if you're thinking of shooting for higher resolutions)

then '''Back the whole lot up!''' (you won't want to do that again in an hurry) 

Don't forget to add some updated + extra datatypes. WarpDT's are v.good but are shareware. AK-DT's are free &amp; some come as Amithlon-native versions. (more speeeed!)


+ Added NewBaer
+ Added LowLevel Library V41.28
+ Added RaMithlon (speeds up memory a lot! - may as well make the fastest Amiga faster) 
* Updated OpenPCI v2.1 (before it was v1.2)
* Updated OpenPCI RTL8139 v1.2b4
* Added AHI v6 m68k (use the 68k archive NOT the Amithlon-native x86 version which can be a pain to get working)
* Added Amiga XL remover (it removes files and icons only used by Amiga XL, so useless under Amithlon)
* Updated the installer script (many changes) + Added rtg.lib v40.3992 (from WinUAE 1.5.0)


* First thing you should install MUI and update its libraries...
* You can replace some of your OS tools with MUI versions . For ex. MagicASL...
* Do not forget MagicMenu 
* OS4 Theme and dual PNG icons are done by AFA_OS,
* DualPNG icon set is KEN's ICONS v3 (v4 is much better) (don't forget to donate Ken :-))
* PowerWindowsNG lets you drag windows off the screen, like in MSWindows.
* For totally customizable requesters don't forget to install ReqAttack


PS: Note the programs, FroggerNG, ScummVM... And don't forget that you can play Doom and Quake with very good frame rates... Most of these software can be downloaded from Aminet, for others just click links :-)
PS2: You can page a maximum of 1GB ram in ATI gfx cards. If you have NVidia it is maximum 768MB.



BB3 does not exist officially but if you Google for it you'll fine a few sites that refer to post-Hyperion patches + bug-fixes that probably won't make a huge improvement. (maybe WB a bit faster, as if you need that with Amithlon!) But, hey it's good to have all the latest stuff!
(These patches can yield useful speed increases if you are using a 'real' Amiga &amp; are stuck with AGA)


One weakness of Charlie's guide/package are the OpenPCI drivers; they're out of date. There are newer versions of OpenPCI, the 8139 driver, and powerpci library (the latter wasn't included in the archive). I was having semi-random crashing with the RTL8139 card until I upgraded.

The list goes on &amp; on...

* Miami? Yes, it's more 'advanced' than Genesis(AmiTCP) but Genesis is MUCH faster &amp; more reliable in my experience. DCHP? You can find patches for this on Aminet if you really want but what I did was to assign a Static IP for Amithlon in Genesis even though my network is set up for DCHP. All I did was go into the Router's prefs &amp; set it to always assign the same IP to the Amithlon's NIC - no messing, no patches, no Miami, no conflicts - worked like a charm...

...you may then want to brave the Amiga-ports of SAMBA &amp; SMBFS but that's a whole new story.


Now comes the fun bit, throw every eye-candy patch you can @ it &amp; see Amithlon lap it up. 
* DirOpus? Great (shame about the icon support)
* PowerIcons? Great for PNG'ness (shame about the dragged images)
* Scalos? (not as good as DirOpus but has proper PNG support - I never got this to work that well with Amithlon)
* PowerWindowsNG? Great for all-sorts (you need to be running a patched rom for it to work - how you do that in Amithlon is another story, but among the files included with my guide is a hacked version of smallird.gz that has a patched rom)
* MagicMenu? Use a nice background image &amp; set it to semi-transparency (rude not to)
* MCP? good idea.
* ModePro?
* E-UAE?

Lots of other worthwhile patches, Speed-up patches do make a noticeable difference: 0.5% on a real '040 will be barely perceptible but the same change with an '040 running @ 1ghz + can be seen.
Why not install a few emulators while you're at it? ShapeShifter under Amithlon is faster on the same hardware than any other 68k Mac emulator under any other OS.
You want 3D support? That can be done to via Warp3D. (see higher up this thread)





===Issues===

For Intel CPUs there is a patch for Intel Pentium CPU's in one of the BoingBags. I hope you have chosen the right one as installing it. 


The suspect is mostly the graphic card. Because you say it crashes when you double click OS3.9 or BoingBag installers. The first thing these installers do is to open their own Public Screens with the highest resolutions available. And you also say it works fine with another graphic card without higher resolutions.

* Did you update Picasso? If you did, you should be only updating the drivers, not the Picasso executables. Please refer Charlie's guide on this.
* Did you copy the new rtg.library from one of the latest WinUAE packages. (which is v40.3994) It helps a lot at opening higher resolutions and increases speed too. It resides in &quot;Amiga Programs&quot; folder in WinUAE archives and should be copied to your &quot;SYS:Libs&quot; drawer.

If the above two is not your cure: You mention that it works flawlessly with the internal HD image (which as I know is fine tuned by Charlie). So why don't you copy whole the files of that system to your harddrive partition and begin making your customizations from there? 


Actually everything i did was just the same as you suggested. First after making amiga's partitions i copied everything from amithlon_hd to my system partition, and then i started upgrading from that point. I copied it with &quot;copy amithlon_hd: system: all&quot;. This weekend i tried installing everything again, from scratch, all over again (hehe i am not giving up, until i make this working).

1) With Geforce2 mx/mx400-64MB I can't do anything. As when i installed it before, for the first time i tried, it crashes when i start to install OS3.9-Install (BB3.9-1). ScreenMode doesnt offer me to change modes. My workaround was to install AmithlonUpdates first (from patches folder) then i can change mode with new powerfb monitors, i change mode to 1024x768x8bit. After this, i installed OS3.9-1, then BB3.9-2, everything that should be installed. I also installed System updates again (which i installed first in the process) to make sure it wasnt overwritten by some of later installations, just in case.
After everything, i can use geforce2 card, i applied settings to nvidia-1. I can test and use many of the resolutions but the only stable one is 1024x768x8bit. When i test from picasso96 for example, 16bit color mode, its displayed instantly and properly, but when i switch to it, after some time i have mouse freeze or just system crash.
I also updated rtg.library. I didint installed new picasso96 cause honestly i dont know what exactly to select from the options not to ruin system. So i just copied rtg.library to picasso lib and i copied picasso96fix to my C:. I added it to my startup-sequence before loadwb, C:Picasso96Fix (not sure if its all right, thats why i am explaining my steps).
Its all the same, i can't switch to 16bit mode. Monitor is Sony trinitron17&quot; multiscan 200sx. 1024x768 is fine resolution for it, just i am stucked with color modes.

2) I also installed everything from the beginning with other card S3 Savage 4, 16MB. I can installed os3.9-1, bb3.9-2, all the updates without doing anything else. everything works fine (everything done in small resolution, default 640x480. After all the updates, i tried this card in VESA mode. I can apply settings in picasso96 to board vesa-1. But i think this video card has weak vesa support. I can use only 8bit mode, when trying to go to 16bit mode it becomes unstable, crashes and restarts.

3) Not quitting yet. I took my laptop with me to have internet connection. Cause i couldnt achieve all i wanted on P3, I installed everything on my laptop. Intel CoreDuo, 80gb sata, via chipset and video is (it sucks but it is what it is) Via Chrome9 HC IGP /128mb. Everything going fine, all, the installations and updates. I tried to run it in VESA mode, it works. And its completely stable in 16bit mode, 1024x768. 32bit mode i think doesnt work, cant tell for sure(cant remember, lots of testing for entire weekend). Its a wide screen 15.4&quot; TFT laptop display, so this resolution looks a bit stratched on the screen. All the other modes dont work. I wanted to increase resolution but its out of my hands, and knowledge:-) Not sure if its even possible to achieve 1440x900 whats native for this display. 


I would also like to report success with the AmigaSYS3 package for Amithlon. It quickly gets you to the point where you can fire up AmigaAMP to test your AHI configuration and ample opportunities to crash your system with IBrowse/networking

&quot;Amithlon patches for linux-2.4.35.3
maybe s.o. wants to build newer amithlon kernel - with these diff
applied against linux-2.4.35.3 it shouldn't be a problem.
To apply the patch under a gnulinux system:
extract linux-2.4.35.3
cd /path/to/linux-3.4.35.3
gzip -cd /path/to/amithlon-2.4.35.3-final.diff.gz | patch -p1

initrd /amithlon/bigird.gz
&lt;/pre&gt;



===Editing===

From Charlie's guide you can download AmithlonSys.rar, extract it and take kern310, bigird and smallird from it. There is MENU.LST in Grub folder so take a look and copy kernel argument lines for both internal hdd and installos3.9 to use them in lilo. You should start with bigird, internal amithlon hdd. You have 2Gb of Ram so remove 1 gig and boot with one only. Change memory amount to mem=768 and try booting with kernel310. In this line all the files are in folder /amithlon so if your folder is different you should change it accordingly.

 kernel /amithlon/kern310 console_level=4 init=/linuxrc root=/dev/ram0 mem=768M vga=769 ramdisk_size=12010 leavepages=8200 cachesize=65536
 initrd /amithlon/bigird.gz

After booting you should reach the workbench. As you already have 76 partition you should have it on the desktop and format it (quickly). In tools, HDToolBox, check devices to see if the system finds your drives, hdd, cd/dvd-rom. If there is no other drives than internal_hdd then system can't mount your virtual (&amp;76) partition due to unsupported chipset controller. Proceed to phase 2 ;-)

Once in linux (i already explained these steps before but here it is again) you should have AmithlonSys.rar somewhere on the desktop (or extracted). We need bigird.gz. Console is our primary tool.

&lt;pre&gt;
bzip2 -d bigird.gz
(and you have bigird extracted)
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/bigird
sudo mount -t ext2 bigird /mnt/bigird -o loop
(and its mounted in /mnt/bigird)
&lt;/pre&gt;

With file explorer go there and find diskfile_haage (that's amithlon internal hd) and copy it somewhere you have access from Windows (on fat32 partition). You can also copy shape.rom to use it in WinUAE. If you don't have any fat32 partitions copy it to USB flash drive or just email the files to yourself :-)

Now in Windows, setup WinUAE. If you already have OS3.9 installed it's great, if not, you just need Worbench adf, floppy image to boot with. Add one more hard drive and that would be your &amp;76 partition. It will appear in the list beginning with [PART]. Also add hard file and that is diskfile_haage. Boot with Workbench disk. The point is to use WinUAE to copy internal_hd content to &amp;76 (virtual partition). Use HDToolBox to format the partitions (add additional partitions), make it bootable, etc.

copy amithlon_hd: name~of~your~partition: all

That's it. If you followed Charlie's guide you can here change FileSystem type, etc.



Amithlon is sometimes a painful job when it comes to installing. Here is a quick howto besides Charlie's beautiful guide. It can be handy if original or gary's kernel don't work for you and my kernel doesn't support bigird booting (internal disk image mouting) simply due to kernel architecture, ramfs conflict. No big deal, here is a workaround.

Probably you can do these first steps in windoze, i am using linux. Any linux live distro will do, just to extract what we need then you don't need it any more.

-To extract bigird.gz place it somewhere on your hdd so you can access it later from linux; or just copy it to usb flash.

-Once in linux copy it somewhere, on the desktop for example. For a little less experienced users, i will show you how to do it under ubuntu. Default user is 'ubuntu' and default home folder in livecd is 'home/ubuntu/'
So bigird.gz is placed on desktop. Launch terminal.

Code:

cd /home/ubuntu/Desktop
gunzip -d bigird.gz

it's extracted. Lets mount it.

Code:

sudo mkdir -p /mnt/bigird
sudo mount -t ext2 bigird /mnt/bigird -o loop

it's mounted.

Now fire up file explorer, go to file system, /mnt/bigird and find diskfile_haage. Copy it to your fat32 partition, or usb flash, so you can use it later in WinUAE.

Now it's all pretty easy. You need a partition (as in Charlie's guide) with id &amp;76.. You can set it up in linux as well, with fdisk, id should be 76. In already configured WinUAE you can simply add real partition from your hdd and also diskfile_haage as a hard disk image as additional partitions. Pretty straightforward from now on. Initialize, format virtual (even full format works), copy everything from amithlon_hd to your hdd, set it all up, tune up the bootloader and you're ready to go.



Change memory amount to mem=768 and try booting with kernel310. In this line all the files are in folder /amithlon so if your folder is different you should change it accordingly.

kernel /amithlon/kern310 console_level=4 init=/linuxrc root=/dev/ram0 mem=768M vga=769 ramdisk_size=12010 leavepages=8200 cachesize=65536

initrd /amithlon/bigird.gz

After booting you should reach the workbench. As you already have 76 partition you should have it on the dekstop and format it (quickly). In tools, HDToolBox, check devices to see if the system finds your drives, hdd, cd/dvd-rom. If there is no other drives than internal_hdd then system can't mount your virtual (&amp;76) partition due to unsupported chipset controller. Proceed to phase 2 ;-)

Once in linux (i already explained these steps before but here it is again) you should have AmithlonSys.rar somewhere on the desktop (or extracted). We need bigird.gz. Console is our primary tool.

&lt;pre&gt;
bzip2 -d bigird.gz
(and you have bigird extracted)
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/bigird
sudo mount -t ext2 bigird /mnt/bigird -o loop
(and its mounted in /mnt/bigird)
&lt;/pre&gt;

With file explorer go there and find diskfile_haage (that's amithlon internal hd) and copy it somewhere you have access from Windows (on fat32 partition). You can also copy shape.rom to use it in WinUAE. If you don't have any fat32 partitions copy it to USB flash drive or just email the files to yourself :-)

Now in Windows, setup WinUAE. If you already have OS3.9 installed it's great, if not, you just need Worbench adf, floppy image to boot with. Add one more hard drive and that would be your &amp;76 partition. It will appear in the list beginning with [PART]. Also add hard file and that is diskfile_haage. Boot with Workbench disk. The point is to use WinUAE to copy internal_hd content to &amp;76 (virtual partition). Use HDToolBox to format the partitions (add additional partitions), make it bootable, etc.

copy amithlon_hd: name~of~your~partition: all

That's it. If you followed Charlie's guide you can here change FileSystem type, etc.

Now you should boot with grub/lilo and with smallird.gz. It doesn't contain internal amithlon hd but it looks for amithlon's partition on actual hard drive to boot from. If with kernel310 system didn't find your &amp;76 partition on first boot, you can't boot with it now either. Use my kernel4 instead. You should copy kern310, kernel4 with the rest of the files to boot folder so when grub/lilo starts you can change the boot options on the fly.

kernel /amithlon/kernel4 console_level=0 init=/linuxrc root=/dev/ram0 mem=768M vga=769 ramdisk_size=2310 leavepages=5200 cachesize=65536

initrd /amithlon/smallird.gz





===For developers===

Linux source is included. If you want to start working on the kernel, add new drivers or just compile your own kernel, optimized for your hardware only (my optimized kernel boots in 5 secs.), linux source is here. GCC required to compile this (the latest 2.4 kernel) should be kept up to 3.3.x. (gcc 3.4 also has problems to cleanly compile it). I recommend using gcc 3.2.3 for perfectly clean compiling (2.95.3 is also fine). If you have problems setting up build environment (i used ubuntu 9.10) you can send me an email and i will try make a howto set it all up, build older gcc on newer ubuntu distro.

==Introduction==

;[http://library.morphzone.org/Magic_User_Interface_Programming Magic User Interface MUI] 

[http://amiga.sourceforge.net/amigadevhelp/ Mui original classes] [http://tbs-software.com/guide/index.php or here] are identified by the trailing .mui like List, String, etc 

MUI (Zune) replacement classes MCCs came later which include Nlist, BetterString, etc which some developers frown upon. 


Please read autodocs/MUI_Application.doc/MUIM_Application_NewInput it has a proper example for a '''complete''' main loop. A MUI program has a main loop, but in an ideal application the loop is empty. Main loops as well as hooks are a thing of the past but backwards compatibility is still there. 



'''New method'''
So nowadays, in order to handle notifications from buttons, sliders, etc - you [http://guidetoamigacompatibleprogramming.googlecode.com/svn-history/r4/trunk/english/CAP_4.txt subclass Application.mui], Window.mui or &lt;one of the groups&gt;.mui of your choice, define your own private methods there and setup notifications on your buttons to call these methods. This lets you keep a neat internal structure rather than having everything in a one huge switch statement of return ids. 

Methods have no TRUE or FALSE states nor anything other defined states, they are just function calls (well, sort of). The only approach is subclassing technique and overload the method. You can then do anything you wish... The custom class is your way. 

To define your own private method and attribute ids you could start with TAG_USER.
;Read more [http://guidetoamigacompatibleprogramming.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/english/CAP_5.txt here] 




'''Old Method'''
With MUI you can also call hooks to avoid creating subclasses, but only the change of an attribute can cause an action. 




* First set Application and Window classes information. 
* Use Horizontal Groups (HGroup) or Vertical Groups (VGroup) to stuff objects (buttons, sliders, directory listers, etc) into them. Objects are not placed directly to some fixed locations but are instead grouped in special containers which are then dynamically displayed and positioned. 
* Use [http://www.pcguru.plus.com/tutorial/mui_methods.html Notification] to do something when object changes (pressed, slide, etc) 
* Release them when finished or when ending app 



Macros play a part in programming Zune interfaces. Get and Xget can replace GetAttrs and Set and Xset similarly with SetAttrs. 



When you read the mui autodocs there is a field after the function name with [ISG] and sometimes also [ISGN] 

And that indicates what to can do with the tag.
&lt;pre&gt;
I = Init
S = SetAttr can be used
G = GetAttr can be used
N = Supports Notify
&lt;/pre&gt;

So if you see [I.G] that means that you can use the Tag at Init and use GetAttr on it.

encapsulation is what you have with all the MUI classes. For example to use a listview you have a well defined interface for this gadget, and all implementation details are encapsulated into the class (like private variables etc.) 

You would do similar with an advanced application. Locate all sub-systems and implement these as &quot;isolated&quot; modules with interfaces and implementation details encapsulated into the modules, not visible from the outside. 


inheritance via subclassing 


polymorphism 






===Subclasses===

;[http://library.morphzone.org/General_Rules_and_Purpose_of_Subclassing Subclassing Classes] 


Good source examples [http://www.onyxsoft.se/snakee.html Snakee], [http://www.bluemind.org/amiga-lister-dopus-magellan-lister-system-amigaos/ List], 





====Application====

; [http://www.pcguru.plus.com/tutorial/mui_howitworks.html Read more here] and [http://library.morphzone.org/Subclassing_Application_Class Application Class here] 

Instead of MUI_NewObject(MUIC_Application, ,etc) is often replaced by the macro ApplicationObject, etc, etc... 

When subclassing window or application class there aren't MUIM_Setup/Cleanup methods at all. 

If you want to make a gui where everything is made of custom classes (at least the outer stuff, ie application and windows), you define all your classes as usual, and then instantiate your application with a single newobject() call. It's no problem to add elements to a group/window/application when it is being allocated (inside OM_NEW). 





====Window====

; [http://library.morphzone.org/MUI_Subclassing_Tutorial:_SciMark2_Port#GUI_Design Gui Design] 

Instead of MUI_NewObject(MUIC_Window, ,etc) is often shortened to the macro WindowObject,etc,etc but can be still used in Child Windows... 


The way to do this would be to implement a method in one of your subclasses (MUIC_Window or the window's Root MUIC_Group are always safe picks) and have a MUIA_Window_? notification call it. 


For the positions to be remembered, you have to close the windows (set MUIA_Window_Open to false) before disposing the Zune Application object 




====Classes====

;[http://library.morphzone.org/Subclassing_List_Class Morphos List SubClass] 

Instead of MUI_NewObject(MUIC_Group, ,etc) is often erewritten as the macro &lt;Group&gt;GroupObject,etc,etc... 


Then class creation:

 TheClass = MUI_CreateCustomClass (NULL, supername, NULL, sizeof (MyObjectData), dispatcher);

&lt;pre&gt;
  if (!(mcc = MUI_CreateCustomClass(NULL,MUIC_Area,NULL,sizeof(struct NewClass_Data),NewClass_Dispatcher)))
  {
    printf(&quot;Cannot create custom class.\n&quot;);
    return(0);
  }
&lt;/pre&gt;


Is it ok to inherit from other types of object? Yes, to subclass slider class to overload MUIM_Numeric_Stringify method. 

How to check for a minimum version of a MUI MCC when building a GUI? [...] 
Your best chance is that the custom class writer has overloaded MUIA_Version/Revision. 






===Doing Stuff===

And here is a way to access this inside a method:

&lt;pre&gt;
LONG AnyMethod (Class *cl, Object *obj, Msg msg)
{
struct MyObjectData *data = INST_DATA(cl,obj);

/*...*/

if (!strcmp (&quot;Amiga&quot;, data-&gt;Pointer)) DoSomething();

/*...*/
}
&lt;/pre&gt;


Memory allocated for object data structure is freed automatically by MUI in object destructor, you have to do nothing. 

 struct MyObjectData *data = (MyObjectData *)INST_DATA(cl, obj);




====Dispatcher====

Then, in your dispatcher subprogram, you write something like case MUIM_NList_ContextMenuBuild then MyOwnContextMenuBuild(cl,obj,msg); then you write a subprogram MyOwnContextMenuBuild that does what you want your class to do when this method is called. 

Every object in your subclass gets its own data area added to the object &quot;structure&quot;. Also known as a data instantation. It is your own var area privately for the object with the given size in the MUI_CreateCustomClass() call but do not use the obsolete MUI_GetClass() and MakeClass() pairing. See the [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=2765 Class2.c] example in the MUI:Developer/C/Examples dir. 




====Overloading====

'''Overloading''' class methods is the main and best design to use when you need to add some class features or use some specials behaviours. In MUI C version this is done by creating a new MCC (MUI Custom Class) and a dispatcher routine catching incoming BOOPSI messages when DoMethod() is called on instance of this MCC. 

To find out when a superclass's attribute changes without using a Notify? Yes, just overload OM_SET. 
Most (if not all) calls to OM_SET are done with a temporary tag list allocated on the stack, so it'll be lost anyway... 



If you need this pointer separate for every object, you should place it in object data structure. 

&lt;pre&gt;
struct MyObjectData
{
char *Pointer;
};
&lt;/pre&gt;



Tag list or method structures should be untouched in any way if it's not documented. If MUI or 3rd party mcc's do this they're broken... Example of documented method structures touched by MUI are MUIM_Draw and MUIM_AskMinMax... 

MUI will call MUIM_Hide, MUIM_Show on your object if the dimension change. So no need to check this in MUIM_Draw. MUIM_Draw is btw always called for a reason, so see no reason for you to omit a redraw here. 

&lt;pre&gt;
ULONG NewList_New(struct IClass *cl , Object *obj, Msg msg)
{
    return 0;
}


ULONG NewList_Set(struct IClass *cl , Object *obj, Msg msg)
{                   

    return(DoSuperMethodA(cl, obj, msg));
}


ULONG NewList_Get(struct IClass *cl, Object *obj, Msg msg)
{

    return(DoSuperMethodA(cl, obj, msg));
}

&lt;/pre&gt;






===Application &amp; Window===

Need to get a pointer to an active window object at any time. How can i do this? 
Normally you should search for MUIA_Window_Active in Application window list. 
Can create MUIC_Window subclass and intercept MUIA_Window_Active, and create your API for this. 
On the other hand, you can setup notification on this tag and if window receives it you will know about it and set some field in memory to window pointer or so. 


MUIA_Window_Screen for your own screen and trying to have window size completely under control. 
Setting MUIA_Window_Width and MUIA_Window_Height always works when you don't specify window ID (MUIA_Window_ID) for WindowObject.
In case you specify this ID, height and width are set automatically by system and are remembered for next time you run application. 


&lt;pre&gt;
     app = ApplicationObject,
         MUIA_Application_Title, (IPTR)&quot;KeyShow&quot;,
         MUIA_Application_Version, (IPTR)&quot;$VER: KeyShow 1.0 (24.02.2012)&quot;,
         MUIA_Application_Copyright, (IPTR)_(MSG_AppCopyright),
         MUIA_Application_Author, (IPTR)&quot;The AROS Development Team&quot;,
         MUIA_Application_Description, (IPTR)_(MSG_AppDescription),
         MUIA_Application_Base, (IPTR)&quot;KEYSHOW&quot;,
 
         SubWindow, (IPTR)(win = WindowObject,
             MUIA_Window_Title, (IPTR)_(MSG_WI_TITLE),
             MUIA_Window_ID, MAKE_ID('K','S','W','N'),
             WindowContents, (IPTR)KeyboardGroupObject,
             End,
         End),
     End;
 
     if (app == NULL)
&lt;/pre&gt;

You must OM_ADDMEMBER a window to an application before opening it and you must OM_ADDMEMBER an area object to a group object (in a MUIM_Group_InitChange/ExitCHange pair) if you want to show it in a window (be part of your GUI). Mui Dev docs have a section on  Dynamic Windows (Dynamic Object Linking/Windows) which are detailed documentation for dynamic window creation. 


But you can create a custom class and get notified just by looking for incoming methods. Overloading MUIM_Setup is probably the best idea. You can subclass your window and put screen change detection in MUIM_Setup. E.g. in every MUIM_Setup you can remember screen pointer somewhere in object data, compare it with the previous value and do some things if screen has changed. use _app(obj) after MUIM_Setup. 


You could have subclass of MUIC_Group where the all objects are placed... When you detect in MUIM_Setup that _screen() changed, you set MUIA_Window_CloseRequest to TRUE...  If you app runs on WB screen user can change WB screen resolution/depth at any time. User can change your screen from the custom screen database at any time. Other thing to consider is iconify from the Exchange or ARexx. You _must_ react for screen changes. 


Then you should place MUIM_Application_Save after your main loop.


Overloading MUIM_Window_Snapshot with some code which saves the prefs would do a save whenever the user selects the Snapshot icon on the window border, it would not do that only at program end. If you really want to save on Snapshot, you have to create a new class with CreateCustomClass() which must be a subclass of MUIC_Window. In the dispatcher of this sub class you have to call your own code whenever the dispatcher receives the MUIM_Window_Snapshot method. Then you have to change the application creation code: You have to replace every window creation with creation of an object of your window sub class (Intuition.NewObject()).


There seems to be a general problem when disposing windows: You must *not* reference the application object in a windows dispose method! Why? Because before disposing a window, you unlink it from the application (OM_REMMEMBER). After that, the window does no longer belong to an application and using _app(obj) is illegal. You don't have _app(obj) available during OM_NEW, the same is true for OM_DISPOSE. 

Using _app(obj) anywhere in setup/cleanup methods (either before or after the DoSuperMethod) is fine. In fact, there is another layer between new/dispose and setup/cleanup where an object learns about its application context. However, this layer has not been made publically available through methods yet. 

MUIA_Window_IsSubWindow does exactly this (skipping OM_REMMEMBER and OM_DISPOSE). However, this is not the solution to all problems which arise from the &quot;global&quot; window list in the application object. Window class should probably be able to have more window children itself. 



How do we get the actual Window from my MUI-object ???

&lt;pre&gt;
struct Window *win;
DoMethod(obj,MUIA_Window,&amp;win);
&lt;/pre&gt;

MUIA_Window is an attribute. You can read attributes by calling GetAttr() from Intuition:

GetAttr(MUIA_Window, obj, &amp;x);

And few warnings:

* MUIA_Window is only valid when the window is opened
* MUIA_Window is an area class tag. Use MUIA_Window_Window for window objects.



To call ChangeWindowBox on MUI windows. Just take care that the window is currently open (MUIA_Window_Window!=NULL) need the screen, you can always get MUIA_Window_Window and use window-&gt;WScreen etc. like with other intuition windows. 





'''MUIM_Application_PushMethod'''

So you want to get out of the object context first, and this is easily done with MUIM_Application_PushMethod. 

&lt;pre&gt;
/* From your mail window */
DoMethod(_app(obj), MUIM_Application_PushMethod, _app(obj), 2,
MUIM_MyApplication_RemoveObject, obj);



/* From your application subclass */
case MUIM_MyApplication_RemoveObject:
{
DoMethod(obj, OM_REMMEMBER, msg-&gt;Obj);
MUI_DisposeObject(msg-&gt;Obj);
}
break;
&lt;/pre&gt;


Basically have a rendering task that does a heap of computation and renders into an offscreen rastport. When it's finished a frame, it sets a flag (Drawn) to FALSE, releases a semaphore, and does a PushMethod. 

The main program, waiting patiently in its event loop, at some point will be awakened by the PushMethod, which triggers the custom class to do a MUI_Redraw() internally, which in turn obtains the semaphore, copies the offscreen bitmap to the window, sets Drawn to TRUE, and releases the semaphore. Then it goes back to sleep. 

The rendering subtask, in the meantime, has done an ObtainSemaphore. When it gets it, it checks to see if Drawn is TRUE. If so, it can continue because it means the main task successfully copied the bitmap. Otherwise it releases it, does a little Delay, and tries again, to try and give the main task time to snatch the semaphore and do its work. 

So, the semaphore is, in effect, protecting the offscreen rastport (and the Drawn flag) - neither task can access or change it without obtaining the semaphore first, and the flag is used to tell the draw task whether the main task has had a chance to do it's job or not. Most of the time (ie. almost always) the main task does, in fact, manage to grab the semaphore immediately so the draw task doesn't manage to steal it back again too quickly. If the main task finishes quickly, then when the draw task tries to obtain the semaphore it succeeds immediately, so there's no penalty. 

PushMethod should not be too heavily overloaded, however, for inter-process communication recommends using private messageports for more intensive stuff. Use it as a signalling mechanism to wake up the main task and get it to send a MUI_Redraw to the custom class, and only ever send one at once (although there are 30-60 of them per second). Never had any problems with it in those circumstances. 

&lt;pre&gt;
struct SignalSemaphore lock_AddEntry_Sem;
...
InitSemaphore(&amp;lock_AddEntry_Sem);
...
while(something){
...
   ObtainSemaphore(lock_AddEntry_Sem);     // Grab the semaphore
   while (lock_AddEntry){                  // Main task completed its job?
      ReleaseSemaphore(lock_AddEntry_Sem); // No, release semaphore
      Delay(1);                            // Wait a bit
      ObtainSemaphore(lock_AddEntry_Sem);  // Try again
   }
...
   lock_AddEntry = TRUE;                   // Set flag
   ReleaseSemaphore(lock_AddEntry_Sem);    // Give CPU back to main task
...
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

MsgPorts are slower. Semaphores are better to use under any AmigaOS like. 




MUIM_HandleEvent is called for each event handler node unless MUI_EventHandlerRC_Eat is returned. MUIM_HandleInput is called for an active object if it was not eaten by MUIM_HandleEvent. 

Should use EventHandler and not request ? To avoid getting events even if my object is not the active one ?
Yes - eventhandlers respect properties such as the active and default object, priorites etc. 
HotkeyString is a subclass of BetterString. It adds a new eventhandler with a higher priority, thus get the events before its superclass, which wouldn't be the case for the other approach (one could override MUIM_HandleInput, but this was just *one* example...) 

Eventhandlers also allow you to swallow input, another thing which isn't possible with IDCMP-requesting. This means many objects (which use the old way) will only interpret input when they are the active or default object,
which is bad e.g. in IProbe where I want HTMLview to react on arrow up/down, even when the URL-string is active - and this is AFAIK only possible with eventhandlers. 

the proper way to know the current active window (IDCMP_ACTIVEWINDOW/IDCMP_INACTIVEWINDOW was what I tracked before). What is the proper MUI way to know a window has become active? You can attempt a setup dispatcher that add the required actions to the event handler. 

&lt;pre&gt;
struct your_data
{
struct MUI_EventHandlerNode ehnode;
};

ULONG yoursetup(struct IClass *cl, Object *obj, Msg msg)
{
struct your_data *data = (struct your_data *)INST_DATA(cl, obj);

if (!DoSuperMethodA(cl, obj, msg))
return(FALSE);

data-&gt;ehnode.ehn_Object = obj;
data-&gt;ehnode.ehn_Class = cl;
data-&gt;ehnode.ehn_Events = IDCMP_ACTIVEWINDOW | IDCMP_INACTIVEWINDOW;

DoMethod(_win(obj), MUIM_Window_AddEventHandler, &amp;data-&gt;ehnode);

return(TRUE);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

add a cleanup dispatcher that looks like :

&lt;pre&gt;
ULONG yourcleanup(struct IClass *cl, Object *obj, struct MUIP_HandleInput *msg)
{
struct your_data *data = (struct your_data *)INST_DATA(cl, obj);

DoMethod(_win(obj), MUIM_Window_RemEventHandler, &amp;data-&gt;ehnode);
return(DoSuperMethodA(cl,obj,msg));
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Add a dispatcher for MUIM_HandleEvent and take care of your wanted event like :

&lt;pre&gt;
ULONG yourhandler(struct IClass *cl, Object *obj, struct MUIP_HandleInput *msg)
{
struct your_data *data = (struct your_data *)INST_DATA(cl, obj);

if (msg-&gt;imsg)
{
case IDCMP_ACTIVEWINDOW:
// Do what you want here
break;

case IDCMP_INACTIVEWINDOW:
// Do what you want...
break;
}

return(DoSuperMethodA(cl, obj, (Msg)msg));

}
&lt;/pre&gt;

or You could try to install an event listener that triggers every time MUIA_Window_Activate gets changed. 


Be able to receive mouse co-ordinates and keypresses into my application, even when the window is not active. 
You can poll intuition base and read mouse coords at any time. An interrupt routine would be the best solution if your app wants keep an eye on it all the time... (might be possible with other libraries) 


Everything is single threaded unless you specifically use MUIM_Application_InputBuffered. No functions are interrupted in order to handle a signal. Would a better method be to offload the MUI interface handling onto a
separate task, and communicate with the network task through signals? This would at least solve the problem mentioned above. STRICQ uses MUI and is setup to handle any number of simultaneous sockets, both TCP and UDP. 
First create another window, then call MUIM_Application_InputBuffered (even though you should really try to avoid this) and then do the PushMethod. What should I do if the InputBuffered had to be used to handle other actions? Come up with a design pattern that avoids this nasty input probing in the middle of your program 
Creating a subclass of application class for this purpose where you could call one method with the object to be deleted as an argument and the application sub-class then stored a pointer to this object and deleted it after MUIM_Application_Input returned (and a nested counter tells me that there is no other recursive call to MUIM_Application_Method). Remember that the MUIM_PushMethod is not safe in the sense that it can fail (e.g. out of memory) and then your object doesn't get deleted (i.e. memory leak). The solution using a sub class of application class is safe as there is no need to allocate memory for the pointer to the object by adding it to an 'internal' Group class. 




====Iconify==== 

 MUIA_Application_DiskObject,GetDiskObject(&quot;PROGDIR:mp3player&quot;),

where PROGDIR:mp3player is the name of your app. Be aware, that you are leaking the disk object this way. Be sure to assign it to pointer and FreeDiskObject after your application has ended.. 


 struct DiskObject *my_app_icon;
 MUIA_Application_DiskObject,my_app_icon=GetDiskObject(&quot;PROGDIR:zamp&quot;), 


 ULONG iconified=0;
 get(application, MUIA_Application_Iconified, &amp;iconified);
 if( !iconified)



How to execute an arexx script from your own program as though it was run from your program's arexx port.
An application subclass that adds one method called MUIM_Application_RunScript, just call this method with the scriptname and its arguments then it will be launched with your (MUI) port as host and it will make sure your program doesn't quit before the script has completed. 



&lt;pre&gt;
ULONG ListWindows( Object *application )
{
ULONG windows = 0;
struct MinList *windowlist;
windowlist = (struct MinList *) xget( application,
MUIA_Application_WindowList );
if( windowlist &amp;&amp; !IsListEmpty( (struct List *) windowlist ) )
{
Object *object, *objectstate = (Object *) windowlist-&gt;mlh_Head;
while( object = NextObject( &amp;objectstate ) )
{
Printf( &quot;Object 0x%08lx is %swindow.\n&quot;,
object,
IsWindow( object ) ? &quot;&quot; : &quot;not &quot; );
windows++;
}
}
return( windows );
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can check whether object class is class or subclass of MUIC_Window, using similar code to below: 

&lt;pre&gt;
BOOL IsWindow( Object *object )
{
struct IClass *windowclass = MUI_GetClass( MUIC_Window );
struct IClass *class;
for( class = OCLASS( object ); class; class = class-&gt;cl_Super )
if( class == windowclass )
return( TRUE );
return( FALSE );
}
&lt;/pre&gt;





====External input====

 MUIM_Application_AddInputHandler(struct( MUI_InputHandlerNode ) in the MUIM_Setup and MUIM_Cleanup methods of your class (not subclass?). 

Remove with MUIM_Application_RemInputHandler 




'''Obsolete Hooks''' Is it safe to call the MUI_DisposeObject() inside a hook which is called by a notification if it frees the object the notification is attached to? This is not safe. The hook contents are not freed because after returning from the hook, there is still some return code from the calling class which has to be executed.

When a Zune object is created and destroyed several methods are called:

&lt;pre&gt;
OM_NEW
MUIM_Setup
MUIM_AskMinMax
[ window is opened here ]
MUIM_Show
MUIM_Draw
MUIM_Hide
[ window is closed here ]
MUIM_Cleanup
OM_DISPOSE
&lt;/pre&gt;

If something is only valid between setup and cleanup it means that the first place where you can use it is the setup method and you aren't allowed to use it after cleanup. 


If you want to manage a set of invisible objects the class MUIC_Family may be of help. 


Need to know size of object while program is between MUIM_GroupInitChange and MUIM_GroupExitChange. Simple asking about MUIA_Width a MUIA_Height returns 0. Anyone have any idea? 
Width/height is not valid until you call ExitChange again. But if you need to know object dimensions subclassing is probably the best way to do so. You can get object dimensions by using _width()/_height() macros. 


The object can't tell the difference of whether OM_SET was invoked through SetAttr() or through MUIM_MultiSet. 
Some standard MUI classes do indeed modify the taglist passed to them. A good example is Group class; it sets certain tags to TAG_IGNORE, because they either cannot be forwarded to the children, or shouldn't be handled by its superclass (Area). 


How do you add a selected image to an app to use a different image for normal and selected states ?
Most people are using a Group with PageMode set, so that the group simply toggle the displayed page, when pressed, and each page has the desired image shown on it. 





====Notifications==== 

;[http://library.morphzone.org/Event_Driven_Programming,_Notifications Morphos Notify]


Basically, MUI doesn't use BOOPSI's notification system. Notification happens transparently, the only thing you need to do is pass the method up to your superclass, and you should be doing that anyway -- you don't need to use the approach that non-MUI BOOPSI classes use. 

You can put notification on every attribute of your custom class. That's assuming your class is derived from 
MUIC_Notify. Then MUI will automagically execute the notification whenever you set an attribute. 

You can place a notification on any (public) attribute of any class (or its ancestors) using the MUIM_Notify method. These notifications can be placed at any time from anywhere. 

All you have to do is only change attributes of your object using set(), and in your set method handler add
  return (DoSuperMethodA(cl, obj, msg)); 
at the end. This will pass on the OM_SET up the class hierarchy to Notify.mui, which will then perform the notifications. The other thing, of course, is to always use set() whenever you want to change a value, rather than just assigning it directly. Only within the OM_SET method should you assign it directly. 

When some other class puts a notification on one of your attributes, and your attribute gets changed using set() (or OM_SET), then when it does the DoSuperMethod() call the OM_SET will eventually reach the root class of all MUI classes -- Notify.mui. This keeps a list of notifications to be performed. 

&lt;pre&gt;
    /* This is setting up a notification on the MUIA_Robot_FrameRate * attribute */ 
    DoMethod(MyObj,
            MUIM_Notify, MUIA_Robot_FrameRate, MUIV_EveryTime,
            FrameCntObj,
            4,
            MUIM_SetAsString, MUIA_Text_Contents, MUIX_R&quot;%ld&quot;, MUIV_TriggerValue
    );

...

    /* This is setting the frame rate (actually done within the class
     * itself -- ie. I use set() rather than just changing the value
     * directly in case there are notifications on it. */
    set(obj, MUIA_Robot_FrameRate, data-&gt;framecnt - data-&gt;lastframecnt);

...

/* This is the relevant part of my custom class's OM_SET method
 * handler. */
static ULONG mSet(struct IClass * cl, Object * obj, Msg msg)
{
    struct MyData *data = INST_DATA(cl, obj);
    struct TagItem *tags, *tag;

    for (tags = ((struct opSet *) msg)-&gt;ops_AttrList; tag = NextTagItem(&amp;tags);)
    {
        switch (tag-&gt;ti_Tag) {
...
          case MUIA_Robot_FrameRate:    data-&gt;framerate = (ULONG) tag-&gt;ti_Data;
                                        break;
...
        }
    }

    return(DoSuperMethodA(cl, obj, msg));
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you have an attribute MUIA_Xxx_Yyy that is readable and notifiable, and recognized by mGet() (your OM_GET method). Internally it reads from data-&gt;Yyy. Further, let's say you have a private attribute MUIA_Xxx_YyyP (probably best to give it a numeric value quite different to the rest in your class) that is recognized by mSet() and writes to data-&gt;Yyy. mSet(), however, does *not* recognize MUIA_Xxx_Yyy. The code in the mSet() switch statement that recognizes MUIA_Xxx_YyyP, in addition to writing to data-&gt;Yyy, changes tag-&gt;ti_Tag to MUIA_Xxx_Yyy. Then, when the DoSuperMethodA() call is made, Notify class recognizes the attribute that was changed as MUIA_Xxx_Yyy and correctly performs the notification. 

Suppose your class use the custom attribute MUIA_HHH_MyAttr. Other objects can ask MUI to be notified whenever this attribute is set()ted to a given value,for example you can have something like this: 

 DoMethod(obj1,MUIM_Notify,MUIA_HHH_MyAttr,32,obj2,1,MUIM_MyObj_Changed);

Here object obj2 asks to be notified with method MUIM_MyObj_Changed whenever the attribute MUIA_HHH_MyAttr of obj1 is set()ted to 32. 


Child, Label2(&quot;Allow duplicates:&quot;),
Child, ck6 = CheckMark(TRUE),

DoMethod(ck6, MUIM_Notify, MUIA_Selected, MUIV_EveryTime, app, 2, MUIM_Application_ReturnID, ACT_CK6);

The confusing thing about this bug is that it only affects CheckMark(TRUE) objects (or if you use MUIM_Application_Load to restore the state of checkmarks then those that become set to TRUE will exibit the same problem). 

The autodocs state you 'simply' add your checkmarks and strings (paired together) even in 'invisible' space. You need the string because the autostring for a checkmark is only place-able at the left side (which would be unintuitive). 

&lt;pre&gt;
Object *MakeCheck(BYTE state, char *label)
{
  return ImageObject,
           ImageButtonFrame,
           MUIA_Text_Contents, label,
           MUIA_InputMode   , MUIV_InputMode_Toggle,
           MUIA_Image_Spec  , MUII_CheckMark,
           MUIA_Background  , MUII_ButtonBack,
           MUIA_ShowSelState, state,
           MUIA_CycleChain  , TRUE,
         End;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;




 DoMethod(timerobj,MUIM_Notify,MA_Timer_Seconds,MUIV_EveryTime,obj,2,MM_Clock_Seconds,MUIV_TriggerValue);

This should call MM_Clock_Seconds everytime MA_Timer_Seconds changes. 

&lt;pre&gt;
WaitIO(data-&gt;req);
CurrentTime(&amp;raw,&amp;micros);
today = raw%86400;
SetAttrs(obj,MA_Timer_Seconds,today%60,TAG_DONE);
&lt;/pre&gt;

Notify does not happen 

&lt;pre&gt;
data-&gt;seconds = today%60+30;
data-&gt;minutes = (today%3600)/60;
data-&gt;hours = today/3600;
data-&gt;req-&gt;tr_node.io_Command = TR_ADDREQUEST;
data-&gt;req-&gt;tr_time.tv_secs = 1;
data-&gt;req-&gt;tr_time.tv_micro = 0;
SendIO((struct IORequest *)data-&gt;req); 
&lt;/pre&gt;

timerobj's OM_GET:

&lt;pre&gt;
case MA_Timer_Seconds:
 *msg-&gt;opg_Storage = data-&gt;seconds;
return TRUE; 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Class has no OM_SET but you '''must implement OM_SET''' to notify. I would not use MUI notifications for this kind of events because due to BOOPSI latency. The timer does work (tested by getting MA_Timer_Seconds in every MUIM_Draw for the clock class, but MM_Clock_Seconds never gets called. 

SetAttrs(NULL, ...
In theory you do not have to because SetAttrsA() is only a wrapper call to DoMethodA() which accepts NULL object pointer but this is not documented behaviour either in SetAttrsA() nor DoMethodA(). So do not rely on it but use macro instead to save you from typing if statements.

    }
    return(DoSuperMethodA(cl,obj,msg));

DISPATCHERPROTO(MCC_BIA_dispatcher)
{
struct mydata *mydata = INST_DATA(cl,obj);

switch (msg-&gt;MethodID)
{
case OM_NEW: return( MCC_BIA_New (cl, obj, (APTR) msg));
case OM_SET: return( MCC_BIA_Set (cl, obj, (APTR) msg));
case OM_GET: return( MCC_BIA_Get (cl, obj, (APTR) msg));
case OM_DISPOSE: return( MCC_BIA_Dispose (cl, obj, (APTR) msg));
case MUIM_AskMinMax: return( MCC_BIA_AskMinMax (cl, obj, (APTR) msg));
case MUIM_BIA_Changed: return( MCC_BIA_Changed (cl, obj, (APTR) msg));
default: return( DoSuperMethodA (cl, obj, msg)); 
}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Each time click on one of the checkboxes you get an MUIM_BIA_changed and the function get's called. Within the function readout the checkboxes and rebuild the bit array which can be read and set by using the MUIA_BIA_Array tag. 

Now a notification for MUIA_BIA_Array is required. Do I need to call the class itself by using set(MUIA_BIA_Array) to cause a notification to take place, or is there a more simple way. Calling the class from inside would cause the checkboxes to change and this would result in another MUIM_BIA_changed and we have an endless loop. 

The problem is that setting would cause an update of the class internal gadgets. These would cause a notify and the notify would cause another set(). 

&lt;pre&gt;
//The best way to handle it is to filter out tag list..
struct TagItem *tagitem;
tagitem = FindTagItem( MUIA_xxx_name, taglist );
if( tagitem != NULL )
{
tagitem-&gt;ti_Tag = TAG_IGNORE;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

do-notify set might still causing infinite loop in some circumstances that vary on super class attributes implementation, and therefore in one class version working fine, in second crashing system...

Change the HVSpace for whatever object (group, etc) you want to add..  





'''Obsolete Hooks.''' 

MUI does not allow own position of Components, only automatic positions available (group concept) but by setting and Layout Hook and add and Left, Top, Width and Height to every Object, you can disable this behaviour

Your notify should preferably invoke a method on the class responsible for the action you want to have executed. Tend to gather more general stuff in window or application subclasses. If there's really no place it belongs then you can have it call a hook instead. 

You must add your own layout hook which reports the size. Then simply invoke MUIM_Group_Init/ExitChange on your virtgroup object, as that will cause a re-layout == invocation of your layout hook, which can report new sizes for the contents. If your family tree needs any layout (before rendering) then the layout hook is also the ideal place for this. Take a look at 2b_VRastPort sources on Aminet. 

&lt;pre&gt;
/* gcc syntax */

How to do multithreading in MUI, where the same thread to be running several times simultaneously? Your application tree may only be accessed by one task, as no MUI object is re-entrant nor thread-safe (the
classes are, not the objects). Using 
 DoMethod(app,MUIM_CallHook,&amp;hook)
works fine for running different threads at the same time but when calling the same hook a second time, the first one pauses. 
It is because both threads are running on the same OS task. If you want to have them running simultaneously, you have to create a separate task for each thread, e.g. by CreateProc() from dos.library. 
That method is the same as CallHookA(&amp;hook, app, NULL) which again is the same as just calling the hook-function directly, with 'app' and '&amp;hook' as parameters. Not sure why you think this equals 'multi-threading'. 
If the second event then terminates, the first one continues, but it seems all the local variables have been altered by the second event. Because your code is not reentrant. 





====Finding====

there is also a user field in IClass and you can access to this through MUI_CreateCustomClass() as in the Dispatcher. 
&lt;pre&gt;
mcc = MUI_CreateCust..()
mcc-&gt;mcc_Class-&gt;cl_UserData = data;
&lt;/pre&gt;
in the Dispatcher:
&lt;pre&gt;
data = cl-&gt;cl_UserData;
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://library.morphzone.org/Locating_Objects_in_the_Object_Tree Locating objects in a tree using MUIA_UserData and MUIM_FindUData] 

use MUIA_UserData, to store a pointer to a private struct where IT store information that object/related code might need ... e.g pointers to paths/filenames, whatever you like really. 

the MUIA_UserData of the object contains the given udata\  and returns the object pointer in this case. 







====Area (dragging, RMB etc)====

Let the program know if the user clicks anywhere on the map, the answer is yes: Group class is a child of area class, thus you
can use any attribute of area class, for example MUIA_Pressed. 

Let the program know, if and where the user clicked on the map, the answer is no. That's exactly what custom classes are for. 
If any drawing will be manipulated by the user (e.g. an area for painting with the mouse), you write a subclass of Area class. 
Bitmap is just for displaying rastered images. If you want to have a (resizeable) area for application specific drawings, sub-classing Area is still the right thing to do. 

If you want to create a bitmap of them tiled, which would then be displayed inside the application. 
For this application it is certainly simpler to use a Column group with Bitmap objects as children, or even a group with a custom LayoutHook that adapts the number of columns to the size of the area. 

&lt;pre&gt;
// want the image to be the same size as the picture or if the object has to be bigger then the picture,
// it should be centered (horiz and vertically). 
TextAttr ta = { &quot;topaz&quot;, 8, 0, 0 };
TextFont *Topaz8Font = OpenFont(&amp;ta);

Object *guiobject = ImageObject,
MUIA_Image_Spec, &quot;5:&lt;path&gt;&quot;,
MUIA_Image_FreeHoriz, FALSE,
MUIA_Image_FreeVert, FALSE,
MUIA_Image_FontMatch, TRUE,
MUIA_Font, Topaz8Font,
End;
&lt;/pre&gt;

the Image class is a subclass of Area class, and the Area class can handle input, thus it should be possible to create an Image object that behaves like an ordinary button. Simply try to create an Image object, init the attribute MUIA_Image_Spec as &quot;5:picture_filename&quot; (to load the image via datatypes) and try to init the Area class attribute MUIA_InputMode as MUIV_InputMode_RelVerify. 

Then set up a notification for that object, so you will hear from it, open the window...

It might help to have a look at the &quot;default macros&quot; for images and buttons in mui.h to initialize the other attributes (frame type etc.) properly. 



# Call MUIM_Group_InitChange on a parent group of your object.
# OM_REMMEMBER it from the group.
# Change the size ie you should modify the data used in MUIM_AskMinMax to fill the structure.
# OM_ADDMEMBER it back.
# Call MUIM_Group_ExitChange on the group.






=====MUIM_DRAW=====

If you want to code yourself what your class will display (eg the wireframe drawing with the mui class1 demoprogram), you implement this overriding the MUIM_Draw method. (have a look at the three examples of custom classes class1 (ok), class2 (ok), class3 (obsolete). 

Is it possible to draw on objects outside of MUIM_Draw? MUIM_Draw adds some overhead compared to direct draw (like in gadtools) but overhead is very minimal and you can't notice any slow down either... 

Is there a safe way to do draw into a window/MUI-object outside a Draw-event? 
You can draw only inside MUIM_Draw because:
* your object may belong to virtual group and needs clipping (MUI installs this automatically for MUIM_Draw)
* your application can be hidden (in the iconified state) at anytime and thus _rp(obj) is not always valid.
* your object could be hidden for some reason (page and register groups)

If you just want draw new parts of your objects without full redraw? Then you could do something like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
data-&gt;DrawCommand = MY_OWN_DRAW_COMMAND;
MUI_Redraw(obj, MADF_DRAWUPDATE);
&lt;/pre&gt;

And then in your MUIM_Draw method:

&lt;pre&gt;
MyDraw()
{
DoSuperMethod();

if (msg-&gt;flags &amp; MADF_DRAWUPDATE)
{
switch (data-&gt;DrawCommand)
{
/* UPDATE PARTS YOU WANT TO */
}
}
else
{
/* FULL REDRAW */
}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;



In MUIM_Draw simply call BltBitMapRastPort() to display stuff in screen:

 BltBitMapRastPort(data-&gt;RastPort.BitMap, 0, 0, rp, mleft, mtop , mwidth, mheight, 0xc0);

create a bitmap, embed it in a rastport and set this rastport in your MUI renderinfo - then simply call MUIM_DrawBackground, and the background is drawn into your off-screen bitmap. Remember to set back the rastport 

within your objects area you ae absolutely free to render whatever you want. And about the rastport: You *should* attach an own rastport to the object, if you use any graphics.library functions: Mui expects to find the objects own rastport in the same state after MUIM_Draw is executed. 

If MUIM_Draw not being called (blank area with a frame) then check that you are not calling DoSuperMethodA() first in your MUIM_Draw method and that the MUIM_Draw Method only checks for msg-&gt;flags == MADF_DRAWOBJECT. 

&lt;pre&gt;
switch( msg-&gt;MethodID )
{
[...]
case MUIM_Draw: return( draw( class, object, msg ) );
[...]
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

solved the problem, replaced them in the draw method 

&lt;pre&gt;
if(!DoSuperMethodA(cl,obj,(APTR)msg)) 
    DoSuperMethodA(cl,obj,(APTR)msg);
&lt;/pre&gt;

Typically your object should have an internal buffer where you store the objects state after the last MUIM_Draw. This allows you to draw only those parts of your map, that need to be updated. 


Stuff the parameters into you instance data and call MUI_Redraw() with MADF_DRAWUPDATE. That's what it is for. 
Basically, all rendering is done inside MUIM_Draw. If another method wants to render, it sets up parameters and calls MUI_Redraw().
MUI_Redraw() will then call MUIM_Draw for you. 

However, you must be aware that MUIM_Draw might _not_ be called, e.g. when your object is currently hidden. So, MUIM_Draw should only draw; your other methods should do all the other stuff (if you draw an ellipse, you have to store that information somewhere in case a refresh comes in, the application is iconified etc. So, you MUIM_xxx_DrawEllipse will store all that information somewhere (adding the ellipse to a list or drawing it into an offscreen bitmap), then it will call MUI_Redraw(TheObject,MADF_DRAWUPDATE) to update the display). 



What about a 3ds viewer with mui buttons ? Titler display opengl and mui on the same window, so what class/methods can use to display/redirect opengl output onto mui win? 
You need an area subclass to display your GL stuff in MUI window. You only need an offscreen bitmap which is blitted to the window in your MUIM_Draw method. 

InitRastPort(&amp;data-&gt;RastPort) is done in other part of code! Once opengl context is initialized you can render to your offscreen bitmap using GL calls. 

Have a look to aminet/wazp3d in soft3d_opengl.c. Inside there is code to start mesa for aros
(seek ifdef aros...) But aros mesa cant render in a bitmap: You will need to use your mui window + glscissor 

[http://aminet.net/package/dev/mui/GLArea_src AreaGL] may be helpful. 




&lt;pre&gt;
MUIA_Image_FontMatch

MUIA_Image_FontMatchWidth
MUIA_Image_FreeHoriz
MUIA_Image_FreeVert
MUIA_Image_OldImage
MUIA_Image_Spec
MUIA_Image_State
&lt;/pre&gt;





=====MUI_Redraw=====

With MUI_Redraw(), an object tells itself to refresh, e.g. when some internal attributes were changed. Calling MUI_Redraw() is only legal within a custom class dispatcher, &quot;using this function within an applications main part is invalid!&quot;. To solve the same problem with my GUI for the UAE port of AROS, and simply wrapped the MUI_Redraw inside a custom method. 

&lt;pre&gt;
MUIM_UAEDisplay_Update, struct MUIP_UAEDisplay_Update *,
({

if (message-&gt;top &gt;= data-&gt;height || message-&gt;bottom &lt;= 0)
return TRUE;

if (message-&gt;top &lt;= 0)
message-&gt;top = 0;

data-&gt;update_top = message-&gt;top;
data-&gt;update_bottom = message-&gt;bottom;

MUI_Redraw(self, MADF_DRAWUPDATE);

return TRUE;
})


case OM_SET:
{
struct TagItem *tagitem, *tagstate = msg-&gt;ops_AttrList;
while( tagitem = NextTagItem( &amp;tagstate ) )
{
case MUIA_[classname]_Update:
{
MUI_Redraw( obj, MADF_DRAWUPDATE);
break;
}
}
return( DoSuperMethodA( cl, obj, msg ) );
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

But better might be making just attribute to passing array of vectors.. When it's passed redraw is called.. or custom method: 

&lt;pre&gt;
case MUIM_[classname]_Update:
{
MUI_Redraw( obj, MADF_DRAWUPDATE);
return( 0 );
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

You must not completely intercept OM_SET. Program sub-class some MUI class like Area.mui or Group.mui and they have their own attributes that might be set during program running.. Intercepting them or redrawing window might cause illegal actions.. 






=====Groups=====

The group class was designed to contain other groups and gadgets not to be a gadget by self. It's a side effect because it's a subclass of area class (making it a subclass of notify class and copying part of methods would be senseless). Well... if you want create an image button (button with text and gfx), apart from the group class it could be done by creating subclass of MUIC_Area which in MUIM_Setup load necessary picture(s) using datatypes.library, draw it in MUIM_Draw and dispose in MUIM_Cleanup. 
Btw. the group class isn't a subclass of area class by mistake. 

Only group objects can have children. To get children there's MUIA_Group_ChildList. Walking through list is done with NextObject(). Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
	Object *obj1;
	struct List *children	= (struct List *)XGET(_maingrp, MUIA_Group_ChildList);
	APTR pObj               = GetHead(children);

	// Parse the children
	while(NULL != (obj1 = NextObject((Object **)&amp;pObj)))
	{
		printf(&quot;ID is: %ld\n&quot;, XGET(obj1,MUIA_ObjectID));
	}
&lt;/source&gt;

To get parent there's MUIA_Parent. 

If you don't know number of children or it's variable you would have to alloc some memory for the method struct (
sizeof(struct MUIP_Group_Sort) + sizeof(Object *) * num_children) and then call it with DoMethodA(obj, alloc'd_method). Then free the method struct again.

num_children = number of successful NextObject() calls on child list.

There's MUIM_Group_Sort method allowing you to tell the group object the exact order of the childs. NListview.mcc uses this and the group_initchange/group_exitchange stuff to dynamically show/hide scrollbars. 

Almost all attributes you set on a group will be forwarded to its children. You can set MUIA_Group_Forward to FALSE to prevent this (while setting the tag in question). 

a MUIM_Group_Insert method for inserting a child into a group in specified place, just like MUIM_Family_Insert. Currently move the child list from the group to my private family, insert the new child into my family with MUIM_Family_Insert and move all children from the family to the group again. on groups just like MUIM_Family_Sort on families.


&lt;pre&gt;
#define MUIM_Group_Sort 0x80427417 /* V4 */
DoMethod(parent, MUIM_Group_InitChange);
    DoMethod(parent, REMMEMBER, obj);
    set(obj, MUIA_FixWidth, 100);  // just some changing beyond the object borders
    DoMethod(parent, ADDMEMBER, obj);
DoMethod(parent, MUIM_Group_ExitChange);
&lt;/pre&gt;

InitChange/ExitChange during setup/cleanup is not a good idea. You should add your childs in MUIM_Setup *before* the DoSuperMethod() and remove your childs in MUIM_Cleanup *after* the DoSuperMethod(). 

should not disable groups anyway just to disable its children. Better disable each child for itself, since this will indeed look nicer. You can do this with one DoMethod, e.g. MUIM_MultiSet or MUIM_SetUData 



Group is intended for objects having visual representation. For a text editor, if you group Buffer and Display objects it will be a bit tricky since Buffer isn't really a gadget. Editor should be a subclass of Display, and Buffer should be attached via pointer in object data structure. It better shows relations between Buffer and Display, they are not just a gadgets in a group. 


Basically you have to call MUIM_InitChange before removing or adding objects and then call MUIM_ExitChange: 

&lt;pre&gt;
DoMethod(yourgroup,MUIM_InitChange)
DoMethod(OM_ADDMEMBER,newobject)
DoMethod(yourgroup,MUIM_ExitChange)
&lt;/pre&gt;



to trigger a relayout by doing a MUIM_Group̠InitChange and MUIM_Group_Exitchange on the _parent(obj)



Every object should be responsible for passing the new settings on to its children. Like when you have a subclass of group that contains a numeric and a string gadget, it will have some attribute that holds a structure of the gadgets' respective values, and the group object has to know which value goes to which of its children and set them accordingly when itself it receives an OM_SET. Then you'd ideally do a set(mywindow,PREFS_ATTRIBUTE,&amp;some_structure) and the object tree would handle the rest by itself. 
Then there's no other way than to remember each object that needs to be updated in some structure and set() it &quot;by hand&quot;. 




virtgroup.mui are internal part of MUI (they're &quot;inside&quot; muimaster.library). 

The virtual group it's like a container that can scroll if the content exceeds its boundaries. A Virtual group makes sense inside a ScrollGroup. 


you should not use MUIA_Pressed for notifying toggle gadgets (only for RelVerify ones like buttons). Use MUIA_Selected. 

&lt;pre&gt;
window
---&gt; group (&lt;--- set MaxWidth/MaxHeight here, works)
------&gt; scrollgroup
---------&gt; virtgroup
------------&gt; text
------&gt; rectangle (&lt;--- or here, works, too)
&lt;/pre&gt;


How to get a virtgroup which is only in the horiz direction virtual w/o using scrollgroup (use MUIA_Scrollgroup_FreeVert, FALSE) or is there a way to have the scrollbar hidden all the time?

You need a [http://morphosambient.cvs.sourceforge.net/morphosambient/ambient/virtgroupclass.c?revision=1.5&amp;view=markup custom class] which uses fixed height or width thus locking virtgroup vertically or horizontally.




Adding objects to a group on the fly. First you have to '''init''' the changes you want to do, then '''perform''' them and then declare you have '''finished'''. Example of code to add or remove a group from another group:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
        Object *_maingrp = .... // the container
        Object *_subgrp = .... // the content

	// add the subgroup
	if(DoMethod(_maingrp, MUIM_Group_InitChange))
	{
           DoMethod(_maingrp, OM_ADDMEMBER, _subgrp);
           DoMethod(_maingrp, MUIM_Group_ExitChange);
	}

	// remove the subgroup
	if(DoMethod(_maingrp, MUIM_Group_InitChange))
	{
           DoMethod(_maingrp, OM_REMMEMBER, _subgrp);
           DoMethod(_maingrp, MUIM_Group_ExitChange);
	}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
LONG sigs;
DoMethod(app,MUIM_Application_NewInput,&amp;sigs);
&lt;/pre&gt;
This seems to be a general pitfall for MUI programmers, but 'sigs' really has to be initialized to zero! 
It's worse: sigs is the result of Wait(), i.e. the signals received by the process. So if you give a random value, MUI will think random signals were received, and act on these. Normally the effect of this is not noticeable, as a message-port signal will just cause a &quot;while(GetMsg(port))&quot;, which will immediately terminate, but in theory serious problems could arise



Want to reproduce the Workbench way of dealing with icons. Want to be able to move images from a point to another. Derive a Group (virtual or otherwise) with it's own custom layout hook and make the objects of that group Draggable; when you get a drop event, re-layout the group (force this using MUIM_Group_InitChange = followed by ExitChange)

=====RMB and LMB=====



RMB menus to gadgets. Context menus are a feature of the Area class, and can be set with MUIA_ContextMenu, or dynamically created by overloading MUIM_ContextMenuBuild. 
Is it possible to use rmb as lmb in MUI? Yes, you should override MUIM_ContextMenuBuild for your object. Create fake Menu object (just with one menu and no items), give it to MUIA_ContextMenu attribute and do your job in MUIM_ContextMenuBuild, returning NULL from there (it means no context menu will be drawn). 
Well, its not easy, because there is no simple method to get informed about RMB _release_. You have to sub-class Text class and write own MUIM_HandleInput, which is mentioned in docs as obsolete. But unfortunately MUI event handlers don't react to RMB (bug in MUI?). can look at the MUIMine source (on Aminet). It does something like that and mentions problems with the RMB. It's also using MUIM_HandleInput.

    if (msg-&gt;obj==obj)
    {   //return(MUIV_DragQuery_Accept);
        return(DoSuperMethodA(cl,obj,(Msg)msg));

            return(MUIV_DragQuery_Refuse);
    }

}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Whenever there are no conflicting inputs, MUI starts the drag operation immediately. If the LMB is needed for anything else (ie on a button), MUI starts dragging like specified in the prefs. set MUI_Draggable, TRUE to an object of a MUI_Area subclass 

&lt;pre&gt;
get(obj,MUIA_List_DropMark,&amp;dropmark);
DoMethod(obj,MUIM_List_InsertSingle,entry,dropmark);
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that you must get the dropmark from the destination object, *not* from the source. 


One mode allows you to enter the data in the string gadget. The other allows dragging.  In the dragging mode you make the StringObject a TextObject.  That way you have no problems dragging the objects around.  You could also try making a Custom string class.

How to get MUI to report the dropped position relative to the object that is accepting the drop?  Also is there some way to get mui to report based on the top, left of the object that was grabbed and not report from where you grabbed the object at? If the position is screen based, just substract from it _mleft(obj) and _window(obj)-&gt;LeftEdge, _mtop(obj and _window(obj)-&gt;TopEdge. 


Is there a way to react to a dragging of a workbench icon into an appwindow created with MUI.
The desktop manager sends message to an application only when user stopped dragging so it is not possible. 

MUI has its way to handle d&amp;d with MUIM_DragBegin/DragFinish for its MUI object.... 
MUIM_DragBegin/Finish are for internal MUI D&amp;D. AppWindow messages are externally generated and MUI can not control it. 

This is typically a method that you usually won't call yourself (like the drag'n'drop methods of area.mui)

====register (TABS)====


how can a child (a tab) of a register (Tab) know that he is currently visible w/o knowning in which tab it is? 
Have a .mcc which is a subclass of group and creates a row of cycletitle-objects (like cycle gadget, but with a fixed title string within the cyclegadget) where each button represents a window. The group gets notified (by notifyintuition.library) when a new window is opened or one win gets closed. 
or create a subclass of group which has a new attribute of something like MUIA_XGroup_PageIndex. You could then compare this to the &quot;main groups&quot; objects active page. You should know the &quot;main group&quot; object as it gets this from reading MUIA_Parent of the &quot;tab page&quot;. 

 if tabpage.pageindex = tabpage.parent.activepage then (simple pseudo code) 

Or create a subclass of register which as well as MUIA_Group_ActivePage has say MUIA_Group_ActivePageObj which is set on a change of MUA_Group_ActivePage. You could then compare this to the &quot;tab page&quot;. 

 if tabpage = tabpage.parent.activepageobj then (simple pseudo code) 

Or create a new method of register that returns the current obj (similar to your above idea) but as a method it will be usable for all your register groups. 



&lt;pre&gt;
MUIA_Register_Frame
MUIA_Register_Titles
&lt;/pre&gt;





====Lists====

;[http://library.morphzone.org/Subclassing_List_Class good examples of lists] 

* The list class is a class which can hold and manipulate (to some extend) a linked list of data. 
* The listview class is a group subclass which handles the layout and interconnection of a list and the required sliders. 

Listtree which uses images for the branches, but afaik doesn't allow you to change the image. 


at startup the list is empty and add entries with MUIM_List_InsertSingle. 

MUIA_List_SourceArray to assign an strarray then use the MUIA_List_Active result as the index for that array. 

MUIM_List_Remove



listview to have the width of the text inside and no more and no less.

 MUIA_List_Format - MAXWIDTH/MINWIDTH

 MUIA_List_AdjustWidth, TRUE

to insert strings in a ListView:

 DoMethod(projectfiles,MUIM_List_InsertSingle,(long unsigned int)TXT.sfilename.c_str(),(IPTR)MUIV_List_Insert_Bottom);




COPYING you will need to define Construct &amp; Destruct hooks as List object does NOT copy your string (just takes a pointer) until you order otherwise. If you got simple one column list and you will be satisfied storing just strings in it, MUI offers builtin construct hooks for this. Refer autodocs for construct &amp; destructs (must set both!). 

 MUIA_List_ConstructHook, MUIV_List_ConstructHook_String

 MUIA_List_DestructHook, MUIV_List_DestructHook_String




MUIV_List_Remove_Selected 



You can call MUIM_List_CreateImage as soon as the list class completed its setup method. You must call MUIM_List_DeleteImage before the list completes its cleanup method. 


MUIM_Insert_xyz inserts an Object to a List, this meant that the List class can handle any Object and so you can not add only Strings to it. only a Pointer is stored and not the content of it. Note the List is not responsible for Displaying its' content, this was done by the Listview and by default it´s Displayhook expects pointers to a Text in the list. 


how to add a small image next to a string in the list? game/think/MUIMastermind.lha might have a simple approach without CreateImage() and so on. 



Reading MUIA_List_Active gives me the entry number, but if the order's changed, it doesn't mean anything? 
GetEntry returns pointer to your entry and you can access any column you wish. It's your private pointer anyway. 



If you want a page background for an app, simply use MUIA_Background, MUII_PageBack for your group object. 





'''Obsolete Hooks.''' If hooks are being used, multicolumn List object to display the result but want to add title to columns 

&lt;pre&gt;
HOOKPROTO(ResultList_Display, ULONG, char **array, struct ReqData *reqdata)
{
if (reqdata) {

int n;
for (n=0; n&lt;reqdata-&gt;nb ; n++) {
*array++ = reqdata-&gt;columns[n];
}
} else {
reqdata = (struct ReqData *)hook-&gt;h_Data; // list titles

int n;

for (n=0; n&lt;reqdata-&gt;nb ; n++) {
*array++ = reqdata-&gt;columns[n];
}
}

return 0;
}
MakeStaticHook(hook_ResultList_Display, ResultList_Display);

Somewhere in your code you set h_Data:

hook_ResultList_Display.h_Data = (APTR)reqdata_titles;
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can either build a hook object that h_entry part is your function and use MUIM_CallHook or subclass the object id_main_add so that it handles a particular method, and in the case of your method is received call your add some function (it's the recommended way).. the callhook stuff would be something like 

 struct Hook h = { addsome, NULL, NULL };

 DoMethod(id_main_add, MUIM_Notify, MUIA_Pressed, FALSE, id_main_add,2, MUIM_CallHook, &amp;h );

====Strings====

How to get notification of when an MUI string gadget is made active? So I know when the user has clicked on the gadget and activated the cursor, but before they start typing anything? I've tried setting MUIA_InputMode to MUIV_InputMode_RelVerify and MUIV_InputMode_Immediate, but neither work with either the MUIA_Pressed or MUIA_Selected notifications. 

Build a subclass of String.mui and do what ever you need to do in the MUIM_GoActive and MUIM_GoInactive methods. 


Converts input from a 'text box' (using Zune/MUI) to a floating point number. 
&lt;pre&gt;
get(my-string-object, MUIA_String_Contents, &amp;str);
    stcd_l(str, &amp;num);
&lt;/pre&gt;


Subclass the gadget and overload MUIM_GoInactive. Just be sure you've considered every situation the user may be in, e.g. leaving the gadget temporarily to copy the rest of the value from some other place or similar. 
Needed to subclass string gadget and add own event handler. As a workaround (imho), return DoSuperMethodA(cl,obj,(Msg)msg); when you return 0. 



You can notify MUIA_String_Contents, which will be triggered each time the content change.
You can probably also use MUIA_Window_ActiveObject, which should be set to everything but the string gadget when it goes inactive. And if you use one of the string gadget replacements then there's also the possibility of overloading MUIM_GoInactive for the string class (Textinput, Newstring or Betterstring). But keep in mind that inactivating the gadget (using tab, the mouse, opening a new window or similar) should never have a confirming effect!

MUIA_String_MaxLen
MUIA_String_Reject
MUIA_String_Secret
&lt;/pre&gt;





====Numeric (slider, knobs, levelmeters etc)====

Releasing the button when NOT over the gadget is well regarded to be a &quot;cancel&quot; action. Like
&quot;whoops! I accidentally pressed the button, but now I don't want to exit, so I'll move my mouse away&quot; 
Sliders also keep the value you dragged them to if you release the mouse outside the gadget. 

How about getting a notification on a slider when the slider is released only? I tried MUIA_Pressed but that didn't work.  If you also use Area.mui/MUIA_InputMode. Also, I noted that MUIA_Slider_Level says (OBSOLETE). Use 
MUIA_Numeric_Value instead. 


If pressing TAB key cycles options. How can I implement that ? 
You just set MUIA_CycleChain (area class) as TRUE in all the objects you want to be part of the cycle-chain. 

Cycle object 
&lt;pre&gt;
STRPTR colors[] = { &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Green&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, NULL };
ULONG colorsV;
STRPTR ch;
// then in the program...
get(cy1, MUIA_Cycle_Active, &amp;colorsV);
ch = (char *)colorsV;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Cycle_active contains the NUMBER of the selected item. To get the string you need to do something like this:

 ch = colors[ colorsv ];


Since MUIA_Cycle_Entries is [I..] the only way is to create a new cycle every time you want to change the entries. To do this you do MUIM_Group_InitChange on the group containing the cycle, then OM_REMMEMBER the old one, OM_ADDMEMBER the new one and do MUIM_Group_ExitChange. You may have to use MUIM_Group_Sort to get the cycle to the right place or put it into a separate group. 

Can anyone tell me if it is possible to create a dynamic cycle gadger
You can &quot;emulate&quot; it by removing the gadget and creating a new one with MUIA_Cycle_Entries changed. Use MUIM_Group_InitChange/ExitChange for this. 

&lt;pre&gt;
MUIA_Cycle_Active
MUIA_Cycle_Entries
&lt;/pre&gt;



a slider with gradient background. You can set gradient by MUIA_Background (but attribute string is undocumented) or maybe overloading MUIM_DrawBackground... 

Sliders that look like a regular button when not pressed, but when pressed, they pop up and become a slider. They save a lot of space. It's a NumericbuttonObject - it's used in the demo program Slidorama. 



&lt;pre&gt;
MUIM_Numeric_Decrease
MUIM_Numeric_Increase
MUIM_Numeric_ScaleToValue
MUIM_Numeric_SetDefault
MUIM_Numeric_Stringify

MUIA_Numeric_Max
MUIA_Numeric_Min
MUIA_Numeric_Reverse
MUIA_Numeric_RevLeftRight
MUIA_Numeric_RevUpDown
MUIA_Numeric_Value
&lt;/pre&gt;






====Menus====

Mui has its own methods for menus but the old NewMenu calls can still be used...

Best way is maybe to create&amp;dispose the context menus you need in a subclass of window class. 
Menu items are set for currently active window? In the case you can setup different menu for each of window, prefereably inside window subclass, and with notification which will call method or attribute or your's window class and it'll be able to react. 


&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;


How to notify on pressing shortcut combination with shift, control and alt keys? I tryed such code:
 DoMethod(win, MUIM_Notify,MUIA_Window_InputEvent, &quot;-control x&quot;,app, 2,MUIM_Application_ReturnID,MEN_RUN);
but I get notification each time X button is pressed (no matter whether control is pressed).

You need a normal eventhandler in your class for that. Please do not use returnid stuff? So I see the only way is to use rawkey hook. Want such shortcuts for menu items, there are too many of them so I can't use combinations with Amiga for each one. menu item &quot;MUI Settings...&quot;. To set a notify to the menu item that calls MUIM_Application_OpenConfigWindow


The way to do this would be to implement a MenuTrigger method in one of your subclasses (MUIC_Window or the window's Root MUIC_Group are always safe picks) and have a MUIA_Window_MenuAction notification call it. There you could either have a switch with all the IDs, or simply use methodIDs instead of menu IDs and just do it like:

&lt;pre&gt;
ULONG mMenuTrigger(struct IClass *cl, Object *obj, struct mpMenuTrigger *msg)
{
DoMethod(obj, msg-&gt;menutriggercommand);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
Once all menu triggers are nicely done as methods (say MUIM_MyClass_Open, MUIM_MyClass_DoSomething) and you've built a menu using those IDs, you could also implement an eventhandler in the Group subclass I mentioned and simply map raw keys into methods again. This could be done nicely using something like:
&lt;pre&gt;
struct MenuKey
{
ULONG methodForQualifierShift;
ULONG methodForQualifierControl;
ULONG methodForQualifierAlt;
ULONG methodForQualifierAltShift;
};
&lt;/pre&gt;
and then have these mapped like
&lt;pre&gt;
struct MenuKey hotkeys[256] = 
{
{0, MUIM_MyClass_Jump}, // RAWKEY_TILDE
{MUIM_MyClass_First}, // RAWKEY_1
....
};
&lt;/pre&gt;

so you can easily map every key combo into a method.

Well... just one of the many possible approaches to this problem, but one that will leave you with a nice oo structure in the source.


Added a check for msg-&gt;imsg-&gt;Code==MENUDOWN which reatcs the RMB being pressed and stops the timer. I also did the reverse msg-&gt;imsg-&gt;Code==MENUUP which would start the timer again. BUT - once the Menu is open the mouse button presses are attached to the menu and not my window/object so the MENUUP button event is never seen so my timer remains stopped and does not start again after using a menu. 
You could use MUIA_Window_MenuAction to be notified when a menuitem was chosen, 
 DoMethod (win, MUIM_Notify, MUIA_Window_MenuAction, MUIV_EveryTime, obj, 2, MM_Main_MenuAction, MUIV_TriggerValue); 
Not sure if the attribute gets triggered when no item was selected... 

Checking window activation does not help either as the window remains active when a menu is opened so nothing changes. You could add a global input handler for checking of RMB pressing and releasing and then also check if the mouse pointer is over your window... 



'''Redundant''' MUIA_Application_Menu and MUIA_Window_Menu (old New Menus system) 

'''Redundant''' MUIM_Application_GetMenuCheck, MUIM_Application_GetMenuState, MUIM_Application_SetMenuCheck, MUIM_Application_SetMenuState 

'''Redundant''' MUIM_Window_SetMenuCheck, MUIM_Window_SetMenuState,  MUIM_Window_GetMenuCheck, MUIM_Window_GetMenuState

MUIA_Menu_Enabled
MUIA_Menu_Title
&lt;/pre&gt;





=====MenuStrip=====


Menustrip class is the base class for MUI's object oriented menus. Its children are objects of Menu class, each of them describes exactly one menu.

A Menustrip object doesn't feature many options itself, but as a subclass of Family class, it simply acts as father for multiple Menu objects.

The Menustrip object is usually specified as a child of either Application class or window class with the attributes MUIA_Application_Menustrip or MUIA_Window_Menustrip.

from autodocs MUI_Menuitem/Menuitem.mui:
&quot;Since Menuitem class is a subclass of Family class, you can add other Menuitems as children of a menu item to indicate sub menus. MUI does not limit the level of sub menus, but the operation system currently allows a maximum nesting level of one. Because of this, children of menu items should not contain other menu items for now, the results are unpredictable.&quot;

With family objects (from Wanderer/Info):

DoMethod(_win(obj), MUIM_Notify, MUIA_Window_MenuAction, MUIV_EveryTime, obj, 2, MUIM_MySubClass_MenuThingy, MUIV_TriggerValue);

Read more about Menus in MUIA_Window_MenuAction section of muidevs. 

See also DiskSpeed.c in DiskSpeed drawer of the contrib-source of AROS.



In one MenuItem tag there wasn`t a &quot;MUIA_UserData&quot; tag identifier in front of the ID of that menuitem and so on a dispose gcc somehow freed an area in memory that caused the crash where sas/c didn`t somehow. 

&lt;pre&gt;
entry = MUI_MakeObject(MUIO_Menuitem,advance_name_translation(i),NULL,0,0);
set(entry,MUIA_UserData,i);
DoMethod(entry,MUIM_Notify,MUIA_Menuitem_Trigger, MUIV_EveryTime, entry,6, MUIM_CallHook, &amp;civstandard_hook, diplomacy_tech, pdialog, plr0-&gt;player_no,entry);
DoMethod(menu_title,MUIM_Family_AddTail, entry);
&lt;/pre&gt;

MUIA_Menustrip_Enabled
&lt;/pre&gt;






====Requesters====


 MUI_Request(app, mainwnd, 0L, &quot;Sorry...&quot;, &quot;Close&quot;, &quot;...but this feature is not yet implemented&quot;, NULL);



Either create your new objects outside this huge MUI constructions, and in there use just a pointer, or get rid of the &quot;End&quot; macro and exchange it with &quot;TAG_DONE)&quot;. On MOS and AmigaOS, the NewObject variadic function is kept in the static library. It takes most of the parameters on the stack - thanks to that the implementation of NewObject calls the NewObjectA function. Everything works perfect, and the typical MUI macros may be easily used.

This, however, is not the case when you compile for AROS. Here, NewObject is a variadic macro, not a function. Thanks such approach we do not need any custom compiler in case of systems, where the arguments of variadic functions are passed partially through registers and partially through the stack (This is the case of PPC and x86_64, this is also the reason why both OS4 and MOS require specially patched compilers).

Since NewObject is a macro, the gcc's preprocessor expects the list of macros arguments enclosed within parentheses. In MUI macros it is not the case. 





=====ASL requester=====

this should [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=1430&amp;forum=2&amp;post_id=11642#forumpost11642 help]:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

if (MUI_AslRequestTags(req,TAG_DONE)) {
/* you can find the drawer in req-&gt;fr_Drawer and the file in req-&gt;fr_File */
}
}

====Pop Up Pen etc====

MUIA_Window or MUIA_WindowObject? MUIA_Window should refer to struct Window * but MUIA_WindowObject to Object *

Both are always NULL for a popup list, whether open or not.

An interesting point is that the window object pointer supplied to the MUIA_Popobject_WindowHook is non-NULL. 
checking for whether popup is open such work arround anyway? Popup object is open only a while, when user clicked popup button and popup object appeared on screen- any clicking causes popup object to disappear. So, I can't even imagine where and why are you checking this.. From 2nd parallel running task? 

If popup object is made by you, you always can subclass any MUI class. And this way you will get all methods and attributes like f.e. OM_SET/OM_GET and MUIM_Setup/MUIM_Cleanup/MUIM_Show/MUIM_Hide. Probably listening on show/hide might help checking whether popup is currently open. This method probably should work also for other MUI applications, if you're not owner of app, but making monitor software- but instead subclassing get and store dispatcher address, then put your own, and listen methods/attrs like above, then call original dispatcher to return control to original application. 

It looks like [http://www.sasg.com/mui/autodocs/MUI_Popstring.html Popstring] has special hooks for this task 
* MUIA_Popstring_OpenHook
* MUIA_Popstring_CloseHook

Shift up/down is (normally) bound to page up/down, and if the listview hasn't been drawn once, then there are no page dimensions. 


DoMethod(PP_String, MUIM_Notify, MUIA_String_Acknowledge, MUIV_EveryTime, App_p, 2, MUIM_Application_ReturnID, RID_EXECUTE); 

A notify watch if a tag changes (for the given object) - MUIA_String_Acknowledge is a tag of the string class (not the Popph-string) and is set (and therefor changed) for the string object. So the notify must be on this object, rather than the container (which is Popph) 

Either get the pointer to the internal string-object, and setup a notify on this (and do try to avoid ReturnID's ;-) ) Should just be to forward MUIM_Notify to the child objects, preferably only if OM_GET returns TRUE for the tag in question. I.e. if OM_GET returns TRUE for the Popph object itself (an Area class tag probably) then keep the notify, otherwise try to see which of the children supports it. Or maybe it'd be better if Popph introduced two new methods a la MUIM_Popph_NotifyString &amp; List. Then one could use either of these to setup a notify on an internal object. 


nothing wrong with ObtainBestPenA() if you don't want the user to configure the pen values (which you often do want) - though avoid placing the pen-stuff in MUIM_Show/Hide, it should be MUIM_Setup/Cleanup, otherwise it'll re-allocate pens each time you resize the window  

If you want the user to be able to configure the pens then you do so by using the Poppen-object together with MUI_ObtainPen() - here's a snip from MUI_PopPen.Doc: 

Anyway, you do not have to care about the internals of this class. Just create it like 

obj = MUI_NewObject(MUIC_Poppen,
MUIA_CycleChain , 1,
MUIA_Window_Title, &quot;Followed Links Color&quot;,
TAG_DONE);

somewhere in your prefs window and everything will be fine. You can get/set the current color from a Poppen object by using the MUIA_Pendisplay_Spec attribute. The resulting struct MUI_SpenSpec may then be saved somewhere in your preferences and used as parameter for MUI_ObtainPen() and MUI_ReleasePen(). 

comes back in the format of: &quot;rxxxxxxgxxxxxxbxxxxxx&quot;. There are 3 parameters in MUI_ObtainPen() *mri , *spec &amp; flags.l 

look in libraries/mui.h and you will fin a macro like this muiRenderInfo() just do this 
 mymri = muiRenderInfo(myobj);
and should have a valid MUI_RenderInfo but this macro should only be used between MUIM_Setup/MUIM_Cleanup 


A popobject which is connected to a string gadget. The popobject is a listview. So that pressing up/down in the string gadget will scroll the listview updown (even when the listview is hidden) ?

====Text====

* (N)Floattext already does exactly the same as you did using the list. It splits a long text into separate lines, inserts some spaces to produce an aligned text and displays them.

* The TextEditor class in read-only does more or less the same like Floattext, but with the ability to apply different styles and coloring apart from the standard MUI text engine. Furthermore it allows to let the user edit the text in read-write mode. YAM makes heavy use of it in both modes to show and edit the mails.

Where ony Text() is done. So the size of the area depends on the size of the actual default font. Using  rp(obj)-&gt;Font, but in AskMinMax it seems that when it is first called, the Font is not yet initialized.
You can use _font(obj) to obtain the font. If you also need a rastport then you can setup one temporarily to do your calculations. 

&lt;pre&gt;
struct RastPort rp;
InitRastPort(&amp;rp);
SetFont(&amp;rp, _font(obj));
WORD size = TextLength(&amp;rp, &quot;The Text&quot;, 8);
&lt;/pre&gt;



The problem is that text will not stay the right size. They are either spread all over the window, or cramped into one edge, when all I want them to do is to stay on the right and just as big to display 6 chars (as long as possible). MUIA_String_Maxlen seems to have no effect, and just forcing one width doesn't seem right as you never know wether the user may prefer to use a font 50 pixels wide. 

Use tag MUIA_FixWidthTxt. For example

 str = StringObject, MUIA_FixWidthTxt, &quot;0000000&quot;, End;

Note 7 characters there: one is for cursor. And use characters which are wide by nature (read MUI_Area.doc and you understand why). 

It could also be solved by using   MUIA_Weight, weight. 
Try a combination of &quot;MUIA_Weight, weight&quot; for the string(s) and Put RectangleObjects before/and/or/after the stringobject. 

For example, to align a gadget to the right 
&lt;pre&gt;
HGroup,
Child, RectangleObject, MUIA_Weight, 75, End,
Child, StringObject,...,MUIA_Weight, 25, End,
End,
&lt;/pre&gt;


Which means that if you want to change the label and the key shortcut using one attr, you should sublcass text, and handle a specific tag for changing the label and the shortcut, parsing yourself the string. Examples of subclassing a mui class can be found in mui dev kit (especially psi contains many subclasses...) and some tools can help you to have a skeleton class using a meta definition of the class you want (mui2c or bcc do such things). 



If you create a subgroup something like:
&lt;pre&gt;
mygroup=Group ( MUIA_Group_PageMode,True
Child,SimpleButton(&quot;_Download&quot;),
Child,SimpleButton(&quot;_Resume&quot;),
TAG_DONE)
&lt;/pre&gt;
you get much better result. The &quot;Download&quot; button is now visible, but if you  

 set (mygroup, MUIA_Group_ActivePage, 1)

&quot;Download&quot; disappears and &quot;Resume&quot; becomes visible. This is very common trick in MUI applications. 



Buttons are simply text objects, which have the following tag:

 MUIA_Text_SetVMax, TRUE 

Setting this to FALSE makes a TextObjects y-size unlimited. Defaults to TRUE which means the objects height is fixed. A plain text object cannot be higher than its text, unless you set MUIA_Text_SetVMax to FALSE (default is TRUE). This will give your object unrestricted height, but the text will be displayed vertically centered, unless you set MUIA_Text_VCenter to FALSE. 



MUIA_Text_Contents is ISG so:

 SetAttrs(text, MUIA_Text_Contents, &quot;NewContent&quot;, TAG_DONE);

 set (object-&gt;STR_text, MUIA_Text_Contents, myText);

object-&gt;STR_Text ? Looks like MUIBuilder generated code :) 

If your 'text-edit-box' is a String object, you'd rather use 

 set( object-&gt;STR_text, MUIA_String_Contents, myText ); 



How to calculate the x/y coords to use with the Move() function so that when using Text() to draw the label it appears centred. There is bunch of macros in mui.h: 
&lt;pre&gt;
_mleft() = starting x coordinate of your drawing area
_mtop() = starting y coord etc.
_mwidth() = width of your drawing area
_mheight() = obvious =)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
text_height=GetItSomeHow();
text_len=TextLength(&quot;heipparallaa&quot;);

Move(rp, _mleft(obj) + ((_mwidth(obj) - text_len) / 2), _mtop(obj) + ((_mheight(obj) - text_height) / 2) );
&lt;/pre&gt;


(TextObject) If you really need to change the text, then you must set() it again after the modification.

If using a TextObject, then it has the FULL initial size... but if appending extra lines then these are not visible (although a bug causes it to write outside of itself!). The only way to get it to enlarge for the new text is to iconise &amp; then uniconise the MUI window. Also, the text is not word-wrapped.

You must not modify the text as long as it is &quot;in use&quot; by the object. MUI will calculate the required dimensions on basis of the given text and expects it to be constant. If you really need to change the text, then you must set() it again after the modification. This will let MUI do a relayout to display all of the new text.

But this will work to a certain extend only, namely when the complete text's height becomes larger than the window's maximum height. If you need to display larger texts, then the object should be placed into a Scrollgroup object (some of which is MUI4 compatible) like this: 

&lt;pre&gt;
ScrollgroupObject,
  MUIA_Scrollgroup_AutoBars, TRUE,
  MUIA_Scrollgroup_Contents, VGroupV,
    Child, TextObject,
      MUIA_Text_Contents, &quot;insert your text here&quot;,
      MUIA_Text_Copy, TRUE,
      End,
    End,
  End,
&lt;/pre&gt;

The attribute MUIA_Scrollgroup_AutoBars will let the scrollgroup show the scrollbars only if they are really needed, i.e. the contents' dimensions are larger than the scrollgroup's dimensions. This attribute is available in MUI4 only like MUIA_Text_Copy, MUI3 will silently ignore it and always show the scrollbars.

Second, the attribute MUIA_Text_Copy instructs Text.mui to keep a copy of your text. This makes it possible to free() the text given to MUIA_Text_Contents after object creation of after set() and it also allows you to modify the text without risking any graphical glitches due to redraw operations while the text is still modified.

However, your text will always be displayed exactly as you specify it. This means that you need to insert line breaks yourself.


If using FloattextObject or TextEditorObject, then no matter the initial contents, the initial size is always 3 lines of text (which is the minimum space needed by the scrollbar + arrows), but it is at least vertically scrollable. Also, the text is word-wrapped.

Since Floattext.mui inserts line breaks itself you cannot expect a variable height, because the text's height depends on the object's width. You can enforce a certain object height by using something like MUIA_FixHeightTxt, &quot;\n\n\n\n&quot;. This will give you a fixed height of 4 lines while respecting the object's font.

Floattext.mui is a subclass of List.mui and as such has no restrictions on its dimensions, except you enforce them, i.e. by using MUIA_FixHeightTxt or by subclassing Floattext.mui yourself with a restricting implementation of MUIM_AskMinMax. MUI cannot just resize an object to display the entire inital content, because the content is arbitrary. It may be zero lines, but it may be a million lines. What should the initial size be in this case? Of course you can override MUIM_AskMinMax and return the dimensions which fit you best, but you must be prepared and accept that MUI will adapt the actual dimensions of the object within the limits that your (or the default) MUIM_AskMinMax method returns.

If want to the Floattext object to be resizeable then you must make the label resizeable as well by adding at least one space object above or below the label object like this:

Child, VGroup, Child, Label2(&quot;FloattextObject&quot;), Child, VSpace(0), End,

This will give you a top aligned label. Placing the label after the VSpace(0) object will make it bottom aligned. Using VCenter() will give you a vertically centered label. Choose the solution which fits your needs best.


Have a look at MUI's demo application MUI-Demo. It uses Floattext objects in every single window.

====Fonts====

try putting SetFont(_font(obj)); in your MUIM_Draw.

In OM_NEW you should set MUIA_Font to one of the predefined values (the MUIV_Font_XXXXXX values) and mui will open the font for you and make it accessible using _font(obj) 

In MUIM_Draw, SetFont() to my fonts opened in MUIM_Setup. If SetFont(_font(obj)) otally lose user-settable-fonts. You are not allowed to change settings of _rp( obj ) directly! So make sure you are working on a copy of original rastport and then set fonts, colours or whatever. 

&lt;pre&gt;
struct RastPort rp1 = *_rp( obj );
struct RastPort *rp = &amp;rp1;

SetAPen( rp, 0 );
&lt;/pre&gt;

The same applies to normal gadgetclass BOOPSI objects, where before drawing anything you have to ObtainGIRPort(), draw and then ReleaseGIRPort()... 


MUICFG_Font_Fixed






====Gadgets====

MUIM_Import/Export and handle the loading and saving yourself. The advantages are that you don't need to create, and call MUIM_Export for the pages that the user doesn't visit, as you'll export the settings (from the created/visited pages) into an already filled dataspace object (loaded during program startup) - which should save both time, memory and complexity. Another advantage is that it makes it very easy to add options such as &quot;Reset to defaults&quot;, &quot;Restore&quot; etc. 


Two functions which should make it easier to save/read IFF files into dataspace objects. 

&lt;pre&gt;
VOID LoadDataspace (STRPTR file, Object *dataspace)
{
BPTR fh;
if(fh = Open(file, MODE_OLDFILE))
{
struct IFFHandle *iff;
if(iff = AllocIFF())
{
InitIFFasDOS(iff);
iff-&gt;iff_Stream = (ULONG)fh;
if(!OpenIFF(iff, IFFF_READ))
{
if(!StopChunk(iff, 'PREF', 'IPRB'))
{
if(!ParseIFF(iff, IFFPARSE_SCAN))
DoMethod(dataspace, MUIM_Dataspace_ReadIFF, iff);
}
CloseIFF(iff);
}
FreeIFF(iff);
}
Close(fh);
}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
VOID SaveDataspace (STRPTR file, Object *dataspace, Object *app)
{
BOOL retry;
do {

retry = FALSE;
BPTR fh;
if(fh = Open(file, MODE_NEWFILE))
{
struct IFFHandle *iff;
if(iff = AllocIFF())
{
InitIFFasDOS(iff);
iff-&gt;iff_Stream = (ULONG)fh;
if(!OpenIFF(iff, IFFF_WRITE))
{
if(!PushChunk(iff, 'PREF', 'FORM', IFFSIZE_UNKNOWN))
DoMethod(dataspace, MUIM_Dataspace_WriteIFF, iff, 0, 'IPRB');

CloseIFF(iff);
}
FreeIFF(iff);
}
Close(fh);
}
else
{
UBYTE buf[84];
Fault(IoErr(), &quot;DOS&quot;, buf, 84);
retry = MUI_Request(app, NULL, 0L, &quot;Error&quot;, &quot;_Retry|_Cancel&quot;, &quot;\33cError
saving:\n%s\n\n%s&quot;, file, buf);
}

} while(retry);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

One object can't belong to two parents.


How does one insure free pens being allocated? I am running most applications on 16 bit screens. Not sure what is required but I would think there should be some way to have some free. What/how does on &quot;free&quot; pens? 
On True/Hi color screens You may expect to have unlimited number of free pens (or at least 65536/16777216 pens), because you can change the color of every single pixel without affecting the rest. But unfortunately all RastPort rendering functions rely on pen scheme and pen fields in RastPort are only 8-bit wide. It gives you only 256 pens. 

Tried to use the MUIA_Bitmap_SourceColors and the MUIA_Bitmap_Precision but all I get is a big black rectangle in place of the discoloured image. Did you set MUIA_Bodychunk_Depth to 5 and MUIA_Bodychunk_Masking to 0
(but check if you save the brush *without* mask plane)? And remember that you should repeat R, G, B values in every byte of a longword, so for example some colour like R=$A5, G=$32, B=$0A, in palette data it looks like $A5A5A5A5,$32323232,$0A0A0A0A. So every palette entry takes 12 bytes. 



You need to set the MUIA_Window_UseBottomBorderScroller (or whatever side you want) on the window. Then create a Prop Object and set the MUIA_Prop_UseWinBorder to the corresponding side(s) that you did in the window. Then just set up a notification on the prop object to listen for changes in MUIA_Prop_First. 
When you place the one on the right and open the window, MUI opens the window the smallest possible and doesn't draw any of the other objects that should be in the window. 






====dtpic Datatypes====

If you would like to get a pointer to the bitmap that holds the data of the picture or a way to copy it to your own bitmap but all Zune attributes did not work. 

In that case you will want to use datatypes.library directly. Dtpic AFAIK is just for easily including datatype images into MUI/Zune GUIs (as button imagery, in listviews and so on...). 

If AROS supports the superbitmap window refresh method then you can. For a non-borderless window you will probably want to make it gimmezerozero (gzz) as well so that the borders and window contents have separate layers (uses slightly more memory). 
That being said just blitting the bitmap into the window is probably a simpler and more portable solution. 

How to &quot;convert&quot; e.g. a png image to a bitmap structure (datatypes?). DTpic.mui is your friend. 
Using picture.datatype and then blitting bitmap to object rastport in MUIM_Draw. 

&lt;pre&gt;
Child, image_button = MakeButton(&quot;PROGDIR:Imagesg/test_but.png&quot;, 't',&quot;\33uT\33nest Button&quot;),


static APTR MakeButton(UBYTE *Image, UBYTE Key, UBYTE *Help)
{
return(MUI_NewObject(&quot;Dtpic.mui&quot;,
MUIA_Dtpic_Name,Image,
MUIA_InputMode, MUIV_InputMode_RelVerify,
MUIA_ControlChar, Key,
MUIA_Background, MUII_ButtonBack,
MUIA_ShortHelp, Help,
PropFrame,TRUE,
ImageButtonFrame,
TAG_DONE));
}
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;pre&gt;
if(app)
{
   struct BitMapHeader *bmhd;
   struct BitMap *bitmap;
   Object *datatype_obj;       /* pointer to the Datatype Object          */
   Object *bitmap_obj;         /* a mui BitmapObject                      */
   Object *list_obj;           /* the one that should be used in the list */

   if(datatype_obj = NewDTObject(&quot;Images/www.iff&quot;,
      DTA_SourceType , DTST_FILE,
      DTA_GroupID    , GID_PICTURE,
      TAG_DONE))
   {
      if(DoMethod(datatype_obj, DTM_PROCLAYOUT, NULL, 1))
      {
         get(datatype_obj, PDTA_BitMapHeader, &amp;bmhd);
         GetDTAttrs(datatype_obj, PDTA_DestBitMap, &amp;bitmap, TAG_DONE);
         if(!bitmap)
            GetDTAttrs(datatype_obj, PDTA_BitMap, &amp;bitmap, TAG_DONE);

         if(bitmap_obj = BitmapObject,
            MUIA_Bitmap_SourceColors  , xget(datatype_obj, PDTA_CRegs),
            MUIA_Bitmap_Width         , bmhd-&gt;bmh_Width,
            MUIA_Bitmap_Height        , bmhd-&gt;bmh_Height,
            MUIA_FixWidth             , bmhd-&gt;bmh_Width,
            MUIA_FixHeight            , bmhd-&gt;bmh_Height,
            MUIA_Bitmap_Transparent   , 0,
            MUIA_Bitmap_Bitmap        , bitmap,
            End)
         {
            list_obj = (Object *)DoMethod(LV_ButtonBank, MUIM_List_CreateImage, bitmap_obj, NULL);
         }
      }
   }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;





in MUI4.0 

&lt;pre&gt;
Child, zoneimage = (Object *) MUI_NewObject(MUIC_Dtpic,
				MUIA_Dtpic_Name, &quot;PROGDIR:resource/zone_local.png&quot;,
				TAG_DONE),
					
DEFSMETHOD(OWBWindow_UpdateZone)
{
	GETDATA;

	char *image;

	switch(msg-&gt;zone)
	{
		default:
		case MV_OWBBrowser_Zone_Local:
			image = &quot;PROGDIR:resource/zone_local.png&quot;;
			break;
		case MV_OWBBrowser_Zone_Internet:
			image = &quot;PROGDIR:resource/zone_internet.png&quot;;
			break;
	}

	set(data-&gt;zoneimage, MUIA_Dtpic_Name, image);

	return 0;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

i.e. by default we set zone_local image, and then by notification calls updatezone when the attribute is set. And it should changes (image i mean), but did't not. I see that i am in the Zone_Internet (by printfs), but image not sets. Problems with 3.9 






===Removal===

&lt;pre&gt;
void ExitClasses(void)
{
    if (NewList)
	{
        MUI_DeleteCustomClass(NewList);
		NewList = NULL;
	}
}   

BOOL InitClasses(void)
{
    NewList = MUI_CreateCustomClass(NULL,MUIC_NList ,NULL,sizeof(struct NewList_Data),&amp;NewList_Dispatcher);

	if (NewList) return(TRUE);
	else        return FALSE;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;



Another thing, which your compiler should notice immediately, is that MyCustomClass is struct IClass * and assigning Object * to it is very, very wrong, and should effect crash at MUI_DeleteCustomClass()... 

&lt;pre&gt;
#define MyCustomObject NewObject(MyCustomClass-&gt;mcc_Class,NULL,

Object *mycustomobject;
mycustomobject = MyCustomObject, End;
if( mycustomobject != NULL )
{
app = ApplicationObject, [... ]
End;
if( app != NULL )
{
[...]
MUI_DisposeObject( app );
}
MUI_DisposeObject( mycustomobject );
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or preferably you should subclass Application.mui class and do your non-visible code there... That's the best way to handle it IMHO... This way main program code will be almost untouched and going back to using standard Application.mui within seconds, just rename MyApplicationObject to ApplicationObject (always define such macros instead of writing NewObject() directly!) 


Objects are removed using OM_REMMEMBER method (must use parent object of course)

When one of the qualifier (shift, ctrl, alt) keys is clicked then the opposite key should get the same state. I tried in the callback function: 
&lt;pre&gt;
BOOL shift = XGET(data-&gt;keybutton[96], MUIA_Pressed) |
XGET(data-&gt;keybutton[97], MUIA_Pressed);

NNSET(data-&gt;keybutton[96], MUIA_Pressed, shift);
NNSET(data-&gt;keybutton[97], MUIA_Pressed, shift);
&lt;/pre&gt;
Pressing the qualifier keys on the keyboard should act as if the button was clicked. I've therefore added an event handler method. It works so far as the visual state of the buttons is changed. Problem is that SET(keyobj, MUIA_Pressed, state) in that event method doesn't trigger the callback hook. 

Try MUIA_Selected, instead of MUIA_Pressed (which is really just a thing to be used for notification, not a real attribute). You'll also have to change code logic, because once the two SHIFT buttons are selected, it won't be possible to unselected them (&quot;shift&quot; var would always be TRUE). 





Networking with a non-blocking recv(), start with one task and make all my interfaces push-based. 
That is, no-one will call recv() but instead be called with the data received from a socket (when it arrives). 
So in your main-loop you wait for both sockets and user events and distribute these to the proper receiver (where the latter would be done by MUI). 
The reason for this approach is to simplify code (eliminate the need to lock resources/data with semaphores etc), and also because found  out that spawning tasks had a noticeable overhead (but you could keep one network manager running all the time to get by this), not to mention that if you receive data on 8 sockets (each having its own process) then your program will be represented with 9 total tasks and thus if another program needs cpu-time it'll only get 1/10th of the time, where your program will get 9/10th, unless you fiddle with the priority of your tasks but then other problems appear. 
If the data you receive needs to be parsed in some way you may at first find it irritating to have to write your parser as a state-machine, but these also have advantages IMO. For example it makes it very easy to add filters to the data stream or create virtual data on the fly... 

Basically you need a socket operating in the non-blocking &amp; asynchronous mode. This prevents GUI being locked while accessing network. Another step is allocate signal bit for bsdsocket and use GetSocketEvent() to find out network actions without braindead select() or WaitSelect() functions. So that whenever network signal is set you call GetSocketEvent() in loop. This GetSocketEvent() returns socket descriptor ID and possible events occurred. 
Avoid GetSocketEvent() and its minion like it was the bubonic plague!!!!!!!! As it turned out, it only
works under Miami. Even though AmiTCP copied the API from M$, it never worked correctly. Use WaitSelect() instead of Wait() in your MUI main loop. See STRICQ 2 src. 
How do you receive data from sockets? Is there a way to associate a signal to a socket? 
You can associate a signal with a socket by using SocketBaseTags(). Use WaitSelect() in the STRICQ v2 socket code. But in v1, used a signal. 

You can encapsulate internet client in MUI application subclass, create some useful methods and attributes like
MUIM_NetApplication_Connect/Disconnect/Send/Receive, and then when user press Connect/Disconnect button, call these methods in notification or callback function (so if NetApplication connected you will disable Connect, and
enable Disconnect etc. gadgets). And so on. Never connect to the internet immediately in OM_NEW, that would be stupid as well as creating needed subprocess in there (which from other side might be not good idea). It can wait then as long as application sends the connect signal or message and then do it's network job, until it receives MUIM_NetApplication_Disconnect method.. How to... merge bsdsocket.library and muimaster.library in single, nicely OOP, application.

WaitSelect() needs a pointer to your signal mask. So you need to do something like: 
&lt;pre&gt;
sigs |= SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C;
ret = WaitSelect(s+1, &amp;rdfs, NULL, NULL, &amp;sigs);
&lt;/pre&gt;
Then 'sigs' should contain the bits normally returned by Wait().

      <text xml:space="preserve">I don't see that MarkLogic has a free community edition, only a trial version.

I don't really get the message behind the following:

The eXist database is now able to provide a rich set of functions '''that are only available in other application servers'''.  What remains is the application development standards that would allow a large number of people developing XRX applications to all work together.

Is this statement valid anymore?</text>

We already have a book about abacus, but I think the simple one is for kids so it should go to Wikijunior. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 10:05, 23 May 2010 (UTC)
:Simple English Wikibooks was for non-native speakers primarily, covering adult content using simple English words.  Some books were incorrectly written as though they were for children.  I don't see anything fundamentally geared toward children in the Simple book and think [[Using an Abacus]] would benefit from receiving the content instead, as it's only one page, needs to be split to subpages, and has several sections missing. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:56, 23 May 2010 (UTC)

==Bogosort==
Please import [[w:Bogosort#Implementations_in_different_programming_languages]] to the wikibooks page [[Algorithm_Implementation/Sorting/Bogosort]]. As discussed on the wikipedia talk page, wikibooks might be a better home for the implementations in various different programming languages. If you take a look at other articles in the same [[Algorithm_Implementation/Sorting|wikibook chapter]], you'll see that the section of the wikipedia article is a perfect fit for this wikibook. If it is technically impossible to import only a section, please import the whole article instead. [[User:Hermel|Hermel]] ([[User talk:Hermel|talk]]) 18:47, 16 September 2010 (UTC)
:{{Done}} but it ''is'' impossible to import only a section.  You'll have to prune out the parts you don't want. It has also been moved to [[Algorithm_Implementation/Sorting/Bogosort]] as requested. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 19:19, 16 September 2010 (UTC)

== Faroese/Chapter One ==

I have copied and pasted text from an earlier revision of a Wikipedia article [[Faroese]].  The text was in the article until it was moved to the talk page on February 5, 2006 by this [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Faroese_language&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=38296974&amp;oldid=37919922 edit] with the suggestion that the material belonged in Wikibooks.  Well, it took 4 and a half years but somebody (me) finally got around to moving the text to Wikibooks.

The last revision of the article to have the text in question was this [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Faroese_language&amp;oldid=37919922 one].  I think the right thing to do is to copy the history of [[en:Faroese language]] up until that revision.

Thanx.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pages and books can be deleted by [[Wikibooks:Administrators|administrators]]. These decisions are generally backed by consensus from a discussion on this page under the deletion section. No process is perfect, and as such, pages or books can be nominated for undeletion in this section. The following is the procedure:

# Locate the page entry in the [[Special:Log/Delete|deletion log]] or the [[Special:PrefixIndex/Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion|archived discussion]]. Some deleted pages have been [[WB:SPEEDY|speedily deleted]] without discussion.
# Review the [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] and [[Wikibooks:Media]]. '''If''' you can build a fair case on something ''which wasn't considered before'', you can raise the issue here.
# Please add new nominations at the bottom of the section. Include a link to the archived discussion (or deletion log if there was none) and your rationale for why the page should be undeleted. If the community agrees, the page will be restored.

''If you wish to '''view''' a deleted module or media file, list it here and explain why. An administrator will provide the deleted module to you in some form - either by quoting it in full, emailing it to you, or temporarily undeleting it. If you feel that an administrator is routinely deleting modules prematurely, or otherwise abusing their tools, please discuss the matter on the user's talk page, or at [[WB:AA|Administrative Assistance]].''&lt;noinclude&gt;[[Category:Wikibooks namespace templates|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/noinclude&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, I have just read your article, and I wanted to make a small contribution to it, with two easy tricks to calculate the correct amounts of first broth and then rice for any paella, because these are the most common failures when you cook one.

When you look at the handles of a paellera, you will notice that they are riveted to the sides of it. The correct amount of broth for any paellera just covers the rivets away; spanish paelleras are designed that way.

Then I have noticed that, in the photo that comes with the article, the rice forms a cross that slightly surfaces over the broth. Some people will say that in Spain we arrange it so for religious reasons, but it is, in fact, an easy way of calculating the amount of rice needed. Just pour the rice into the broth in that way, and you will have the exact quantity of rice for your paella. Then distribute it evenly.

Finally, it might be difficult sometimes to have a white towel, or any towel, to cover your paella, and if you use saffron, which is strongly recommended not for its color only, but rather for its flavoring, it will dye the towel and it is almost impossible to wash the dye off. So, you can use something more expedient as newspaper sheets or any other paper to cover your paella. Simply put some toothpicks upright on the rice so that the paper does not touch it, and then remove them afterwards.

I hope these little tips are useful. Best regards :)

[[Image:rolled oats.jpg|thumb|300px|A tablespoon of rolled oats]]

'''Rolled oats''' are traditionally oat groats that have been rolled into flat flakes under heavy rollers and then steamed and lightly toasted.  The oat, like the other cereals, has a hard, inedible outer husk that must be removed before the grain can be eaten. After the outer husk (or chaff) has been removed from the still bran-covered oat grains, the remainder is called oat groats. Oat groats are a whole grain that can be used as a breakfast cereal. Steel-cut oats are oat groats that have been chopped into smaller pieces and retain bits of the bran layer. Since the bran layer, though nutritious, makes the grains tough to chew and contains an enzyme that can cause the oats to go rancid, raw oat groats are often further steam-treated to soften them for a quicker cooking time (modern &quot;quick oats&quot;) and to denature the enzymes for a longer shelf life.

Rolled oats that are sold as oatmeal usually, but not always, have had the tough bran removed. They have often, but not always, been lightly baked or pressure-cooked or &quot;processed&quot; in some fashion. Thick-rolled oats are large whole flakes, and thin-rolled oats are smaller, fragmented flakes. Oat flakes that are simply rolled whole oats without further processing can be cooked and eaten as &quot;old-fashioned&quot; oatmeal, but more highly fragmented and processed rolled oats absorb water much more easily and therefore cook faster, so they are sometimes called &quot;quick&quot; or &quot;instant&quot; oatmeal. Oatmeal can be further processed into coarse powder, which, when cooked, becomes a thick broth. Finer oatmeal powder is often used as baby food.  Rolled oats are also often the main ingredient in [[Cookbook:Granola|Granola]] and muesli.

Whole oats are an excellent source of thiamine, iron, and dietary fiber.  Fiber is helpful in reducing cholesterol levels in the bloodstream. Whole oats are also the only source of antioxidant compounds known as avenanthramides; these are believed to have properties which help to protect the circulatory system from arteriosclerosis.</text>

[[File:Udon making.jpg|thumb|300px|An artisan rolling up the dough to make Udon.]]


'''Udon''' is a type of thick wheat-flour noodle popular in Japanese cuisine. 

Udon is usually served hot as noodle soup in a mildly flavoured broth, in its simplest form as ''kake udon'', served in ''kakejiru'' made of dashi, soy sauce (shōyu), and mirin.  It is usually topped with thinly chopped scallions. Other common toppings include tempura, often prawn or kakiage (a type of mixed tempura fritter), or ''abura age'', a type of deep-fried tofu pockets seasoned with sugar, mirin, and soy sauce. A thin slice of kamaboko, a halfmoon-shaped fish cake, is often added. Shichimi can be added to taste.

The flavor of broth and topping vary from region to region. Usually, dark brown broth, made from dark soy sauce (''koikuchi shōyu'') is used in eastern Japan, and light brown broth, made from light soy sauce (''usukuchi shōyu'') is used in western Japan.  This is even noticeable in packaged instant noodles, which are often sold in two different versions for east and west.

&lt;br /&gt;
The two boxes represent looking down to the top of a containers of unknown, and likely, different, depth.  In the context of U-Pb isotope dilution the left hand side box represents the Pb fraction of the sample, with gold balls being &lt;sup&gt;206&lt;/sup&gt;Pb and red balls being &lt;sup&gt;207&lt;/sup&gt;Pb, and the right hand side box represents the U fraction of the sample, with blue balls being &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U and pink balls being &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U.  Although we do not know the depth of the container we can easily count the number of balls of each colour in a given container and determine their relative abundances.  This is what mass spectrometers do, very well, we can readily determine the ratio of isotopes of the same element.  The challenge in U-Pb geochronology is to accurately determine the ratio of U balls to Pb isotopes without directly measurement. In the case of &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U/&lt;sup&gt;206&lt;/sup&gt;Pb we would want to know the ratio of blue to gold balls.  However it is not possible to determine the ratio of ball ''between'' boxes of unknown volume. In the case of isotopes of different elements, different elements have different ionisation potentials therefore the measured elemental ratio in a mass spectrometer does not reflect the true ratio in the sample.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In the top panel there are two boxes.  The left hand side box represents Pb and has red and gold balls.  The red balls represent &lt;sup&gt;206&lt;/sup&gt;Pb and the gold balls represent &lt;sup&gt;207&lt;/sup&gt;Pb.  There are 100 red balls and 60 gold balls therefore the &lt;sup&gt;206&lt;/sup&gt;Pb/&lt;sup&gt;207&lt;/sup&gt;Pb ratio = 100/60 = 1.667. The right hand side box represent the U and has pink blue balls.  The pink balls represent &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U and the blue balls &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U.  There are 40 pink balls and 120 blue balls therefore the &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U/&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U ratio = 120/40 = 3.  However, given that we do not know the depth of either container it is not possible to determine the ratio of balls from different boxes.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The bottom panel represents the same two boxes but we have now added some 'tracer' balls.  In the example of U-Pb geochronology, these 'tracers' would be isotopes of the same element that do not occur in the natural samples.  For Pb this could be &lt;sup&gt;205&lt;/sup&gt;Pb and for U we could use &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U and/or &lt;sup&gt;236&lt;/sup&gt;U.  By adding a known amount of tracer balls/isotopes to our sample and measuring the tracer isotope/sample isotope ratio we can quantify amount of sample isotope present. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In the bottom panel we have added two tracers to our sample, a &lt;sup&gt;205&lt;/sup&gt;Pb tracer (teal balls) and a &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U tracer (green balls), and we have added 1,000 teal balls and 20,000 green balls.  Following the simple 'balls in a container' analogy, in the left had side container we now have 12:48:80 teal:gold:red balls, therefore the &lt;sup&gt;205&lt;/sup&gt;Pb/&lt;sup&gt;206&lt;/sup&gt;Pb ratio = 12/80 = 0.15.  If there were 1,000 teal balls added and the ratio of teal/red is 0.15 there must be 6,666.67 red balls in the container.  If we think about Pb isotopes and say we added 1,000 moles of &lt;sup&gt;205&lt;/sup&gt;Pb to our sample and measured a &lt;sup&gt;205&lt;/sup&gt;Pb/&lt;sup&gt;206&lt;/sup&gt;Pb ratio  of 0.15 then we would have 6,666.67 moles of &lt;sup&gt;206&lt;/sup&gt;Pb in our sample.  Moving to the right hand side container we have 16:36:108 green:pink:blue balls.  The &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U/&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U ratio = 16/108 = 0.1484, therefore with 20,000 moles of 233U added to the container we can quantify that the container contains 135,000 moles of &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U.  Completing this simple calculation we can estimate that the &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U/&lt;sup&gt;206&lt;/sup&gt;Pb ratio = 135,000/6,666.67 = 20.25.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is the basic principle that underpins U-Pb isotope dilution geochronology.  Yet, in practical terms this is exercise is not so straightforward for U-Pb geochronology, largely because the amounts of materials we are dealing with would require very accurate weighing of small volumes of materials which is simply not practicable at the level of precision required.  To circumvent the need to know the quantity of tracer added to the sample to a very high-precision we use ''mixed'' tracers.  These mixed tracers allow us to determine the relative concentration of sample isotopes from different elements to a very high level of precision.  Completing the 'balls' in a container' analogy, if we had a mixed tracer of teal and green balls, with a known ratio of teal balls (&lt;sup&gt;205&lt;/sup&gt;Pb) to green balls (&lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U) = 1/20, then we could add a unknown amount of mixed tracer balls and still determine the &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U/&lt;sup&gt;206&lt;/sup&gt;Pb ratio = 20.25.  Try this yourself by changing the number of teal and green balls added to the boxes but remember to keep the ratio of teal to green constant at 1:20.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In U-Pb U-Pb isotope dilution geochronology this is how we are able to determine sample U/Pb ratios to a high-precision.  Each lab will have a bottle of mixed U-Pb tracer (commonly &lt;sup&gt;205&lt;/sup&gt;Pb and &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U) which is added to each sample prior to dissolution.  The isotopic ratio for each element can be determined via mass spectrometry and the elemental ratio (e.g., &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U/&lt;sup&gt;206&lt;/sup&gt;Pb) can be quantified using the isotope dilution approach outlined above.  What is critical to the accuracy of the elemental ratio is the elemental ratio of the mixed tracer.  The method for calibrating a mixed elemental tracer back to the S.I units is outlined elsewhere in this book.

==Units of Size in Microscopy==
*The basic biological unit of measure is the micrometer (µm).
*1000µm = 1mm.

===Calculations in Microscopy===
Size in real life = Size in image ÷ Magnification.&lt;br&gt;
Magnification = Size in image ÷ Size in real life.

#Measure the size of the image in millimetres.
#Convert to micrometers by multiplying by 1000.

Example: A micrograph shows mitochondrion 210mm magnified 2500x. What is its size in real life?&lt;br&gt;
210mm x 1000 = 210,000µm&lt;br&gt;
210,000µm ÷ 2500 = '''84µm'''

Example: An object is 130µm in real life and 52mm in an image. What is the magnification?&lt;br&gt;
52mm x 1000 = 52,000µm&lt;br&gt;
52,000µm ÷ 130µm = '''400x'''

==Microscopes==
'''Light Microscopes'''
:*Light rays travel through the specimen and 2 lenses
:*The objective lens provides the initial magnification of the image
:*The eyepiece lens magnifies and focuses the image

'''Electron Microscopes'''
:*Transmission electron microscopes (T.E.M.) pass a beam of electrons through the specimen to produce an image on a fluorescent screen.
:*Scanning electron microscopes (S.E.M.) scan a beam of electrons over the specimen.
:*Electromagnets focus the image.
:*Electrons are produced from a tungsten filament at the top of a column.
:*The column is a vacuum. As a result, living speciments cannot be used.

*The preparation of specimens for microscopes can be drastic, and can produce artefacts. Artefacts are things you see under a microscope, but aren't actually there in real life. This could be due to something like an air bubble.
*Magnification refers to how much bigger the image is than the actual specimen.
*Resolution refers to how well a microscope distinguishes two different points that are close together. If a microscope can't separate two objects, then increasing the magnification won't help.

Below is a table comparing the different types of microscope.

==Cell Fractionation==
*Cell fractionation breaks apart cells and separates its organelles.

===Step 1: Homogenisation===
*This breaks open the cells.
*Usually done by vibrating the cells, or grinding them up in a blender.
*It is done with a cold, isotonic buffer:
**''cold'' to slow down and stop organelle activity, particularly the hydrolytic enzymes in lysosomes
**''isotonic'' to prevent the movement of water in and out of organelles by osmosis
**''a buffer'' to prevent changes in pH levels.

===Step 2: Filtration===
*Filter the solution to remove debris.

===Step 3: Ultracentrifugation===
*Spin the solution in a centrifuge at a low speed.
*The heaviest organelles (nuclei, chloroplasts) fall the to the bottom.
*The rest of the organelles stay suspended in the fluid above this sediment. This is the supernatant.
*The supernatant is drained off, poured into another tube, and spun again at a higher speed.
*This time, organelles like mitochondria and lysosomes fall to the bottom.
*Again, the supernatant is drained off, poured into another tube and spun at a higher speed.
*Finally, the lightest organelles like ribosomes remain.

=Plasma Membranes=
Plasma membranes are located around the edge of animal cells and surround the cytoplasm and other organelles. They are made up of a phospholipid bilayer which consists of two layer of phospholipids with the hydrophobic heads on the outer layers and the hydrophylic tails on the inner layers.
lipid soluble molecules can diffuse straight through the bilayer, water can osmosise through as well. 
The phospholipid bilayer contains intrinsic and extrinsic proteins. The intrinsic proteins go all the way through the bilayer whereas extrinsic proteins only go through the outer phospholipid layer. 
'''Extrinsic Proteins''' are used for recognition of the cell and usually have a glycoprotein attached for the recognition.
'''Intrinsic Proteins''' are for allowing molecules through. Ways the proteins are designed to allow molecules through are: Protein pump, Protein Channel, Gated protein channel.

=Cholera=
[[Category:A-level Biology|Cell structure]]
Cholera is a disease commonly found in dirty water. Once ingested it sits in the endo thelial reticulum of the gut and sets up an contransporter with Na+ ions . this lowers the water potential of the gut this means thatv water moves in down the concentration gradient meaning that the person is constantly dehydrated and has wet loose faeces. These affects can be countered with oral dehydration therapy.</text>

{{TOC}}

We have learned in Parts 2 and 3 that radio-isotopic dating is capable of producing very precise dates however full exploitation of these data requires considerations of the associated uncertainties. All measurements have an uncertainty associated therewith regardless of precision and accuracy. This is caused by two factors: the limitation of the measuring instrument (systematic uncertainty) and the skill of the experimenter making the measurements (random/external uncertainty). During the past two decades analytical precision has increased substantially due to improvements in both mass spectrometry and laboratory protocols.&lt;br /&gt;

== Some definitions ==
* '''Systematic uncertainty''': biases in a measurement where the mean of individual measurements differs from the true value.
* '''Random/external uncertainty''': aberration in measurements that lacks reproduciblity of a fixed value.
* '''Accuracy''': the correctness of measurements to a quantity's true/accepted value.
* '''Precision''': the degree of reproducibility and repeatibility of measurements.

== Sources and types of uncertainty ==
Without an accurate estimation of total uncertainty, the radio-isotopic age of a given rock or mineral is of limited value.

It is necessary for users of  geochronological data to understand the various sources of error and when one must consider the total uncertainty of a given date as opposed to its constituent parts. Although the uncertainty of each date contains an internal/random component in the total uncertainty, there are also components that are systematic, such as errors from the decay constants.  When comparing ages determined by the same isotopic system these can be ignored offering a potential increase in resolving power.  In this section we review the different sources of uncertainties and the assumptions that underlie the often quoted (or not) errors.  For more detailed treatment of uncertainties in geochronology the following articles are recommended: Ireland and Williams (Ireland and Williams, 2003); Stern and Amelin (Stern and Amelin, 2003), Schmitz and Schoene (Schmitz and Schoene, 2007), and various papers by Ludwig (Ludwig, 1980, 1991, 1998, 2003).

==Decay constants==
One source of systematic uncertainty that affects all radio-isotopic dates are those related to the uncertainty in the decay constants (Table 1).   Three approaches have been taken to determine the decay constants (the probability that a given atom will decay per unit of time) of the long-lived radionuclide; (1) direct counting; (2) ingrowth and (3) geological comparison.  Direct counting involves the detection of alpha, beta or gamma activity relative to the total number of radioactive atoms.  Ingrowth relies upon the quantification of a decay product that is accumulated from a quantity of high-purity parent nuclide over a well-defined period of time. Geologic comparison involves the analyses of cogeneitc materials with multiple chronometers, knowing that each chronometer should yield the same date.  This approach has the potential for relative intercalibration of the decay constants but accurate intercalibration requires that at least one decay constant is accurate and known with some precision.  This is usually assumed to be the 238U and 235U due to the precision with which the decay constants have been determined (Jaffey et al., 1971) and the internal check provided by closed system zircon analyses (Mattinson, 2000; Schoene et al., 2006). 

The counting experiments of Jaffey et al (1971) determined the 238U and 235U decay constants with uncertainties of 0.11% and 0.14% respectively.  These values have been adopted for use in geochronology (Steiger and Jager, 1977).  The 187Re and 176Lu decay constants have been determined by both direct counting experiment and through geologic comparison with the U-Pb system and uncertainties are estimated at ca. 0.4 to 0.5% (Scherer et al., 2001; Selby et al., 2007).

The incorporation of decay constant uncertainties are becoming increasingly important as both the internal precision of dates is reduced and multiple geochronometers are being used to investigate the same time intervals.  The decay constant uncertainties for isochron dates are typically &lt;20% of the total uncertainty budget, in contrast the uncertainties in the U decay constants are often &gt;50% of the total uncertainty budget of U/Pb ID-TIMS dates (Fig. 2).   The situation for the ID-TIMS U/Pb community is that they are now often generating 206Pb/238U and 207Pb/206Pb dates often do not overlap within analytical precision and the U decay constant uncertainties must be considered (Begemann et al., 2001; Ludwig, 2000; Schoene et al., 2006).  As the ‘user’ often uses these date interchangeably we are now seeing 206Pb/238U and 207Pb/206Pb age uncertainties presented as ± X/Y/Z and ± X/Z respectively, where X is the analytical/internal uncertainty, Y is the analytical uncertainty plus the systematic tracer calibration uncertainty, and Z is the total uncertainty including X, Y and the decay constant uncertainties.  This permits use of the data with the level of uncertainty that is appropriate to the problem being addressed.  Mattinson, 2000, 2008 and Schoene et al., 2006 pointed out that sets of high-precision dates from zircons of different ages indicates a difference of approximately 0.2% between 206/238 dates and 207/206 dates due to probable inaccuracy in 235U  decay constant.  This has led to the suggestion that the 235U decay constant be recalculated to achieve concordance between 206/238 , 207/235, and 207/206 dates.  While not officially adopted the authors predict this will become common and users if data must be be aware of this trend.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Random/internal uncertainties ==

Random/internal uncertainties are those relating to the measurement of isotopic ratios of the sample, standards and blank and are used in the derivation of errors of the radiogenic ratios. These uncertainties are intrinsic to each analysis and represent the minimum uncertainty that must be considered.  Most of these sources of random uncertainty relate to the mass spectrometry measurements and our ability to measure and reproduce isotopic ratios.  Factors such as the electronic noise of detectors place a theoretical limit on the precision which can be achieved by detecting a certain number of ions over a finite period of time (counting statistics).  However for almost all geochronologic applications other factors such as correction for mass dependent fractionation that occurs during sample ionisation, and correction for common and/or initial parent and daughter nuclide dominate the analytical uncertainty budget.  It is possible to reduce the uncertainty in the mass dependent fractionation via ‘double-spiking’, where two tracer isotopes of the same element (202Pb-205Pb, or 233U-235U for example) are used for real time mass fractionation correction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Calculating an age from multiple dates==
A significant proportion of age constraints for Neoproterozoic strata are derived from U-Pb dates on zircons from volcanic rocks.  The final reported date and associated uncertainty are often weighted mean dates derived from a number (n) of individual dates on different zircons (or zircon sub-domains).  This is the case for data acquired using both ID-TIMS and microbeam techniques.  The weighted mean weights each individual analyses (such as a single SIMS spot or single grain ID-TIMS analyses) according to its precision so analyses with a low uncertainty  contribute more to the weighted mean than those with high uncertainty.  Importantly, the use of a weighted mean algorithm (or other averaging) is underpinned by the expectation of a single population with normally distributed errors (i.e., there is no correlation between precision of analyses and age).  If the errors on the individual analyses are approximately equal (as is typical for microbeam U/Pb data) then the weighted mean uncertainty is proportional to 1/√n, therefore high-n datasets can be used to reduce the overall age uncertainty for data collected on a single population with normally distributed errors.  If the uncertainties on the individual analyses are variable then the weighted mean uncertainty is controlled by the most precise analyses making the weighted mean date less proportional to n. High-n datasets are critical for assessing analytical vs geological scatter, however the real limit on the precision is the analytical uncertainty of single (spot or grain) analyses as this controls our ability to resolve real variation within a series of analyses due to ‘open-system’ behaviour.

A common measure of the “coherence” of a data set is a statistical parameter called the MSWD (mean square of the weighted deviates; (York, 1966, 1967)). A value of approximately 1 indicates that the scatter in the data can be explained by analytical uncertainties alone, values much less than 1 indicates that analytical uncertainties have been overestimated, and values greater than 1 can indicate either that the uncertainties have been underestimated or that another source of scatter, often called “geological” scatter is present.  Furthermore, the actual MSWD value for which the scatter of the data can be considered due to analytical factors alone, is not restricted to a value of one but in fact varies according to the number of data points in the calculation (Wendt and Carl, 1991). So, to be 95% confident that the scatter of the data is due to the analysis when n=5, an acceptable MSWD range would be 0.2 - 2.2 but for n = 25 this would be 0.6-1.5 (Wendt and Carl, 1991). Although not often explicitly stated, an MSWD of 1 does not necessarily mean there is a single (age) population. Rather, it indicates that if real (age) variation is present, it cannot be resolved within the precision of the individual analyses.

==Uncertainties as a result of geologic complexity==
Uncertainty as a result of geologic complexity is the most difficult to quantify.  The most common cause of excess scatter is open system behaviour resulted from either inheritance of older zircon and/or Pb loss.  For U-Pb zircon analyses reduced errors on single analyses often exposes fine-scale variability that may reflect protracted or punctuated crystallisation of zircon crystals in a magma chamber or the effects of very subtle open system behaviour thus that high-precision analyses do not always transform into reduced uncertainties in calculated weighted mean dates.

Complex U-Pb zircon systematics 

In the past decade errors associated with ID-TIMS analyses have been reduced by almost an order of magnitude.   These reduced errors offer unprecedented precision but also expose geological complexity at the &lt;0.1 % level sometimes resulting in scatter that exceeds analytical uncertainties.  It is now common for a geochronologist to be faced with a population of zircon analyses that do not form a coherent cluster and the crucial question is how to interpret the data to arrive at a depositional age.  The advent of CA-TIMS pre-treatment for the elimination of Pb loss has been extremely important as it gives one confidence that in many cases Pb loss need not be considered as a cause of excess scatter.  Furthermore, for Neoproterozoic rocks, the concordia curve has a shallow enough slope, and the 207Pb/235U dates measured precisely enough to be able to evaluate discordance at the per mil level, however this is not the case for microbeam U/Pb dates.
As outlined above, microbeam U/Pb dates on volcanic rocks rely upon the averaging of a relatively high-n dataset (10-20) of relatively imprecise (ca. 2 to 4%) U/Pb determinations to get a weighted mean date with precision ca. 1% or less.  Underpinning these lower uncertainties is the assumption of a single population with normally distributed errors. However, it is the low precision of each analysis combined with variability of the standard analyses that bracket unknowns that often precludes the detection of subtle amounts of Pb loss or inheritance.  Stated another way, if the amount of Pb-loss or inheritance is less than the precision of a single spot analyses then it cannot be detected via normal statistical proxies (such as the MSWD) therefore the assumption of a normal distribution maybe be invalid (see Fig. 4).  If Pb-loss is the main source of open-system behaviour, this will have the effect of lowering the 206Pb/238U date on some analyses as well as the weighted mean 206Pb/238U date.&lt;br /&gt;

A screen opens with five fields that define your new Event / visit (fig. 3).

&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DefineStudyEvent.jpg|none|thumbs||Define study event]]
&lt;br&gt;

=== Naming your event ===
Every Event gets a unique OpenClinica-ID or OID. You can change the name of an Event at any time, but after creation, you can not change the OID of an Event. For example: you want to create two visits for your study but you are not certain how to name them, so you decide for the time being to call them Visit1 and Visit2. The OID's will be SE_VISIT1 and SE_VISIT2 (fig. 4). Later on you may decide to call them Week 12 and Week 24, but the OID's will not change accordingly.
Furthermore you can add a description to your Event and as always: put as much information here as you possibly can!
If we skip to the last field of this screen we see Category. You can use this field as an extra label of your Event. In the screen &quot;Manage All Event Definitions in Study X&quot; you can sort on this field. 


&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:EventNamesAndOIDs.jpg|none|thumbs||Event name and OID's]]
&lt;br&gt;

=== Scheduling and repeating ===
OpenClinica has three Types of Events / visits: scheduled, unscheduled and common. For a detailed description see the text above the Edit screen: &quot;A Scheduled event is one that is expected to occur for each subject as part of the ordinary progress of the study. An Unscheduled event is not expected to occur, but may occur as circumstance dictates. Scheduled and unscheduled events typically occur at some particular time. A Common event collects data forms, but is not expected to be associated with a particular time.&quot;
In most trials you'll work with scheduled events: Baseline visit, Day 1, Day 6, Day 15, EndOfStudy. And if you know the date of the Baseline visit, you can calculate the dates of the other visits. You would define all these visits as non-repeating, because your study-protocol says so.

But suppose you want to record some details of Subjects who show up on any other day than the scheduled Visit-days. Then you would create an Unscheduled visit with those details. And because Subjects can come more than just once, you would define this Event as Repeating. If more than one Event exists for a Subject you'll see it in the SubjectMatrix as [[Image:DoubleCRF.jpg|none|thumbs||repeating CRF]]

Then the Common Event: you can use this as a way to collect CRF's with all other data, than the the data collected in your study visits. 

This may all seem a bit confusing, but remember: everything about an Event can be changed at any time, except the OID. You can even change an Event from repeating to non-repeating. Even when there are subjects in your study with more than one occurrence of the Event, you still can change the Event from repeating to non-repeating.

      <comment>/* Types of Evaluation Research Studies */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Evaluation research''' is used to determine the impact of a social intervention. A social intervention is an action taken within a social context designed to produce an intended result. Evaluation research thus analyzes the impact of a particular program on a certain social problem the program is trying to solve. 

==Appropriate Topics==
Appropriate topics for evaluation research are as diverse and extensive as any other social research. Many topics exist that are in need of evaluation; however, the ones selected for evaluation have a practical significance. Practical significance refers to a topic's application in the real-world. Evaluation research has to be conducted during real life situations, meaning researchers need real life participants who are willing to be cooperative. 

==Types of Evaluation Research Studies==
In the field, there are three main types of studies:

===Needs assessment studies===
Particular studies directed to determine the existence and extent of problems, usually pertaining to a specific population.

===Cost-benefit studies===
Studies that decide whether the results of a program justify the expense. The cost could have been financial or non-financial.

===Monitoring studies===
Studies that provide a steady flow of information about a topic of interest. These studies are usually conducted over an extended period of time. In some cases, monitoring studies require incremental interventions, meaning the results may change slightly as monitoring methods alter and changes within the topic being studied are made. Common monitoring studies focus on crime rates or epidemic outbreaks.

==Issues of Measurement==
While executing evaluation research, a researcher may encounter issues that limit the overall quality and validity of their findings. With all evaluation research , researchers must be able to operationalize, observe, and recognize the presence or absence of what is under study. A common problem is the attempt to measure a variable that is simply unmeasurable. Also, researchers must be fully aware of outside factors that may influence the variables they are studying. Researchers must also note not just the presence or absence of a variable, but they must analyze the extent to which the variable is present and the amount of its involvement. 

===New vs. existing measures===
When designing an evaluation research study, a researcher must decide whether to create his or her own measures or to make use of existing ones. One consideration is that existing measures may not necessarily meet a researcher’s goals; however, they do allow for comparison.

==Types of Research Design==
===Experimental design===
One evaluation research design type is experimental design. An experimental design for a study whose aim is to evaluate a new medical treatment would likely adhere to the following steps:

*Step 1: identify the population; identify used definitions (operationalizations) and pre-test information on patients used in the treatment

*Step 2: divide patients into experimental and control groups; consider ethical issues: in particular, is it ethically sound to deny treatment of the control group?

*Step 3: determine the length of the measurement

*Step 4: determine the details of measurement, context, interventions, etc.

*Step 5: wait for the treatment to run its course, measure what’s needed, and determined how the response variable was changed (if at all)

===Quasi-experimental design===
Another evaluation research design type is quasi-experimental design. Quasi-experimental designs are non-rigorous inquiries that somewhat resemble controlled experiments; however, they lack key elements that are indicative of experiments, including pre- and post-testing and/or control groups. 

===Time-series design===
Time-series design is an additional evaluation research design type. This design type entails measurements made over a fixed time period, such as the study of traffic accident rates before and after the lowering of the speed limit in an area.

===Multiple time-series design===
Multiple time-series designs utilize more than one set of data collected over a period of time, such as accident rates over time in several states or cities. This design type allows comparisons to be made.

===Social indicators research===
Social indicators research is a popular avenue that combines evaluation research with the analysis of existing data. Social indicators are measurements that are reflective of the quality or nature of social life. Social indicators are frequently monitored in order to determine the nature of social change within a society. Some commonly used social indicators include crime rates, infant mortality rates, and the number of physicians per 100,000 population.

===Nonequivalent control groups===
Nonequivalent control groups share similarities with the experimental group, but they are not selected based on random assignment. For example, two comparable schools might be used; one as a nonequivalent control group, one as the experimental group.

==Common Problems==
Researchers who utilize evaluation research must contend with numerous problems. They may experience difficulty ensuring subjects’ full cooperation. Additionally, they may have trouble finding willing participants, as research and participation in it is a priority for few.

==Ethics==
Like other forms of social research, evaluation research must take into account ethical considerations. As mentioned earlier, sometimes evaluation research studies may require the split of subjects into experimental and control groups. When considering controversial topics, such as sex education programs, it can be the evaluation research itself that raises ethical problems. In this case, the following question might be raised: is it ethically sound to expose only the experimental group to sex education programs?

==Results and Interpretation==
Results from evaluation research are not always put into practice. One reason for this is that implications may not be presented in such a manner that is understandable to non-researchers. Additionally, results may contrast with researchers’ beliefs. Researchers may have a vested interest in the results. They may also be pressured to come up with certain results, such as positive findings for a pharmaceutical company. In this case, ethical concerns regarding the researchers’ objectivity must be raised. When laypersons interpret research findings, they must always be aware of the highly political aspect of research. Political agendas can be difficult to identify, and they often cause research to be biased. This involves not just party politics, but also politics that are at play within the scientific and academic communities.

==Introduction==


&lt;pre&gt;
create socket
set sock addr
set sock port
open socket
send socket ( request_string )
receive result
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
#include &lt;proto/socket.h&gt;
#include &lt;bsdsocket/socketbasetags.h&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The bsdsocket.library get created in memory once you start the AROSTCP. Those included will supply the links for it.

&lt;pre&gt;
#include &lt;proto/exec.h&gt;
struct Library * SocketBase = NULL;
int h_errno = 0;
extern int errno;
&lt;/pre&gt;

and then in the initialization code:

&lt;pre&gt;
if(!(SocketBase = OpenLibrary(&quot;bsdsocket.library&quot;, 4 ))) {
SDLNet_SetError(&quot;No TCP/IP Stack running!\n&quot;);
return(-1);
}

if( SocketBaseTags(SBTM_SETVAL(SBTC_ERRNOPTR(sizeof(errno))), (IPTR)&amp;errno,
SBTM_SETVAL(SBTC_HERRNOLONGPTR), (IPTR)&amp;h_errno, TAG_DONE )) {
SDLNet_SetError(&quot;Error initializing bsdsocket\n&quot;);
return(-1);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

changed the include dir for the networking apps to $(AROS_DEVELOPMENT)/netincludes 
had to change #include &lt;bsdsocket.h&gt; to include &lt;proto/bsdsocket.h&gt; 
bsdsocket.library doesn't exist as a binary in libs:. It is created on-the-fly after you do &quot;startnet&quot; 



redefine SocketBase to a non-global variable, such as a field in a thread-specific context. E.g.:

 #define SocketBase my_thread_context-&gt;socket_base 



looked at the Task struct and it has tc_UserData, just what I needed I could use this to hold the SocketBase for each task. This approach will work, even if I want to use sockets in the main program. In case someone is interested, I created this little header:
&lt;pre&gt;
#ifndef TASKSOCKBASE_H
#define TASKSOCKBASE_H

/*
 * Per-task socketbase using tc_UserData
 */

#include &lt;proto/exec.h&gt;

#define SocketBase FindTask(NULL)-&gt;tc_UserData
#define __BSDSOCKET_NOLIBBASE__
#include &lt;proto/bsdsocket.h&gt;

#endif
&lt;/pre&gt;

Included this everywhere instead of proto/bsdsocket.h, and used SocketBase as normal. 





WaitSelect() works just like select() and would be nice to paste bit of the code here where it fails... sys/select.h 
WaitSelect can only be used on sockets, not on DOS filehandles. On unix they are handled uniformly, but on Amiga you have to use different code path for file handles and sockets. 

&lt;pre&gt;
#ifndef select(nfds,rfds,wfds,efds,timeout)
#define select(nfds,rfds,wfds,efds,timeout) WaitSelect(nfds,rfds,wfds,efds,timeout,NULL)
#endif
&lt;/pre&gt;

and the test the select 

&lt;pre&gt;
struct timeval timeout;
int socket_d;
struct fd_set client_d;


//set to 3 mins
timeout.tv_sec = 3 * 60;
timeout.tv_usec = 0;

do
{

rc = select(socket_d + 1, &amp;client_d, NULL, NULL, &amp;timeout);


/* Check to see if the select call failed. */
if (rc &lt; 0)
{
perror(&quot; select() failed&quot;);
break;
}


/* Check to see if the 3 minute time out expired. */
if (rc == 0)
{
printf(&quot; select() timed out. End program.\n&quot;);
break;
}
} 
&lt;/pre&gt;

socket -- create an endpoint for communication
 
=== SYNOPSIS ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
     #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
     #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
 
     int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol)
 &lt;/source&gt;
=== DESCRIPTION ===
     Socket() creates an endpoint for communication and returns a
     descriptor.
 
     The domain parameter specifies a communications domain within which
     communication will take place; this selects the protocol family
     which should be used.  These families are defined in the include
     file &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;.  The currently understood formats are
 
          AF_UNIX         (UNIX internal protocols),
          AF_INET         (ARPA Internet protocols),
          AF_ISO          (ISO protocols),
          AF_NS           (Xerox Network Systems protocols), and
          AF_IMPLINK      (IMP ``host at IMP'' link layer).
 
     AROS AMITCP/IP currently supports only AF_INET protocol family.
 
     The socket has the indicated type, which specifies the semantics of
     communication.  Currently defined types are:
 
          SOCK_STREAM
          SOCK_DGRAM
          SOCK_RAW
          SOCK_SEQPACKET
          SOCK_RDM
 
     A SOCK_STREAM type provides sequenced, reliable, two-way connection
     based byte streams.  An out-of-band data transmission mechanism
     may be supported.  A SOCK_DGRAM socket supports datagrams
     (connectionless, unreliable messages of a fixed (typically small)
     maximum length).  A SOCK_SEQPACKET socket may provide a sequenced,
     reliable, two-way connection-based data transmission path for
     datagrams of fixed maximum length; a consumer may be required to
     read an entire packet with each read system call.  This facility
     is protocol specific, and presently implemented only for PF_NS.
     SOCK_RAW sockets provide access to internal network protocols
     and interfaces.  The types SOCK_RAW, which is available only to
     the super-user, and SOCK_RDM, which is planned, but not yet
     implemented, are not described here.
 
     The protocol specifies a particular protocol to be used with the
     socket.  Normally only a single protocol exists to support a
     particular socket type within a given protocol family.  However,
     it is possible that many protocols may exist, in which case a
     particular protocol must be specified in this manner.  The
     protocol number to use is particular to the &quot;communication domain&quot;
     in which communication is to take place.
 
     Sockets of type SOCK_STREAM are full-duplex byte streams, similar
     to pipes.  A stream socket must be in a connected state before any
     data may be sent or received on it.  A connection to another
     socket is created with a connect() call.  Once connected, data may
     be transferred using recv() and send() or their variant calls.
     When a session has been completed a CloseSocket() may be
     performed.  Out-of-band data may also be transmitted as described
     in send() and received as described in recv().
 
     The communications protocols used to implement a SOCK_STREAM insure
     that data is not lost or duplicated.  If a piece of data for which
     the peer protocol has buffer space cannot be successfully
     transmitted within a reasonable length of time, then the
     connection is considered broken and calls will indicate an error
     with -1 returns and with ETIMEDOUT as the specific error code (see
     Errno()).  The protocols optionally keep sockets &quot;warm&quot; by forcing
     transmissions roughly every minute in the absence of other
     activity.  An error is then indicated if no response can be
     elicited on an otherwise idle connection for a extended period
     (e.g. 5 minutes).
 
     SOCK_SEQPACKET sockets employ the same system calls as SOCK_STREAM
     sockets.  The only difference is that recv() calls will return
     only the amount of data requested, and any remaining in the
     arriving packet will be discarded.
 
     SOCK_DGRAM and SOCK_RAW sockets allow sending of datagrams to
     correspondents named in send() calls.  Datagrams are generally
     received with recvfrom(), which returns the next datagram with its
     return address.
 
     An IoctlSocket() call can be used to specify a task to receive a
     SIGURG signal when the out-of-band data arrives.  It may also
     enable non-blocking I/O and asynchronous notification of I/O events
     via SIGIO.
 
     The operation of sockets is controlled by socket level options.
     These options are defined in the file &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;.
     setsockopt() and getsockopt() are used to set and get
     options, respectively.
 
=== RETURN VALUES ===
     A -1 is returned if an error occurs, otherwise the return value is
     a descriptor referencing the socket.
 
=== ERRORS ===
     The socket() call fails if:
    [EPROTONOSUPPORT]
          The protocol type or the specified protocol is not supported
          within this domain.
 
    [EMFILE]
          The per-process descriptor table is full.
 
    [EACCESS]
          Permission to create a socket of the specified type and/or
          protocol is denied.
 
    [ENOBUFS]
          Insufficient buffer space is available.  The socket cannot be
          created until sufficient resources are freed.
 
=== NOTES ===
     socket() calls the fdCallback() with action codes FDCB_CHECK and
     FDCB_ALLOC to check and mark the new descriptor as allocated
     if the callback is defined.  See SocketBaseTagList() for more
     information on fdCallback().


Some sample [http://shoe.bocks.com/net/ code tutorial]





==TagList==

 SocketBaseTagList -- Set/Get SocketBase attributes.
 
=== SYNOPSIS ===
     #include &lt;amitcp/socketbasetags.h&gt;
 
     ULONG SocketBaseTagList(struct TagItem * taglist);
 
     ULONG SocketBaseTags(ULONG tag, ...);
 
=== FUNCTION ===
     Set or get a list of (mostly) SocketBase instance dependent
     attributes from the AMITCP/IP.
 
=== INPUTS ===
     These functions expect as their argument a standard tag list, one
     or several array of struct TagItem as defined in the header file
     &lt;utility/tagitem.h&gt;. The structure contains two fields: ti_Tag
     and ti_Data.  The ti_Tag field contains tag code, which determines
     what the SocketBaseTagList() should do with its argument, the
     ti_Data field.
 
     The include file &lt;amitcp/socketbasetags.h&gt; defines macros for base
     tag code values.  Base tag code macros begin with `SBTC_' (as
     Socket Base Tag Code).  The base tag value defines what data item
     the tag item refers.
 
     The tag code contains other information besides the referred data
     item.  It controls, whether the SocketBaseTagList() should set or
     get the appropriate parameter, and whether the argument of the tag
     in question is passed by value or by reference.
 
     The include file &lt;amitcp/socketbasetags.h&gt; defines the following
     macros, which are used to construct the ti_Tag values from the base
     tag codes:
          SBTM_GETREF(code) - get by reference
          SBTM_GETVAL(code) - get by value
          SBTM_SETREF(code) - set by reference
          SBTM_SETVAL(code) - set by value
 
     If the actual data is stored directly into the ti_Data field, you
     should use the 'by value' macros, SBTM_GETVAL() or SBTM_SETVAL().
     However, if the ti_Data field contains a pointer to actual data,
     you should use the 'by reference' macros, SBTM_GETREF() or
     SBTM_SETREF().  In either case the actual data should always
     be a LONG aligned to even address.
 
     According the used tag naming scheme a tag which has &quot;PTR&quot; suffix
     takes an pointer as its argument.  Don't mix the pointer arguments
     with 'by reference' argument passing.  It is possible to pass a
     pointer by reference (in which case the ti_Data is a pointer to
     the actual pointer).
 
     The list of all defined base tag codes is as follows:
 
    SBTC_BREAKMASK
          Tag data contains the INTR signal mask.  If the calling task
          receives a signal in the INTR mask, the AMITCP/IP interrupts
          current function calls and returns with the error code EINTR.
          The INTR mask defaults to the CTRL-C signal (SIGBREAKF_C,
          bit 12).
 
    SBTC_DTABLESIZE
          Socket Descriptor Table size. This defaults to 64.
 
    SBTC_ERRNO
          The errno value. The values are defined in &lt;sys-errno.h&gt;.
 
    SBTC_ERRNOBYTEPTR
    SBTC_ERRNOWORDPTR
    SBTC_ERRNOLONGPTR
    SBTC_ERRNOPTR(size)
          Set (only) the pointer to the errno variable defined by the
          program.  AMITCP/IP defines a value for this by default, but
          the application must set the pointer (and the size of the
          errno) with one of these tags, if it wishes to access the
          errno variable directly.
 
          The SBTC_ERRNOPTR(size) is a macro, which expands to one of
          the other (BYTE, WORD or LONG) tag codes, meaning that only
          1, 2 and 4 are legal size values.
 
          The NetLib:autoinit.c sets the errno pointer for the
          application, if the application is linked with it.
 
    SBTC_ERRNOSTRPTR
          Returns an error string pointer describing the errno value
          given on input. You can not set the error message, only get
          is allowed.
 
          On call the ti_Data must contain the error code number.  On
          return the ti_Data is assigned to the string pointer.
          (*ti_Data, if passed by reference).  See the file
          &lt;sys-errno.h&gt; for symbolic definitions for the errno codes.
 
    SBTC_FDCALLBACK
          A callback function pointer for coordination of file
          descriptor usage between AMITCP/IP and link-library.  By
          default no callback is called and the value of this pointer
          is NULL.  The prototype for the callback function is:
 
          int error = fdCallback(int fd, int action);
 
         where
         error
               - 0 for success or one of the error codes in
               &lt;sys-errno.h&gt; in case of error. The AMITCP/IP API
               function that calls the callback usually returns the
               error back to the caller without any further
               modification.
 
         fd
               - file descriptor number to take action on.
 
         action
               - one of the action codes, which are defined in the
               header file &lt;amitcp-socketbasetags.h&gt;) as follows:
 
              FDCB_FREE
                    - mark the fd as unused on the link library
                    structure. If fd represents a file handled by the
                    link library, the error ENOTSOCK should be returned.
 
              FDCB_ALLOC
                    - mark the fd allocated as a socket.
 
              FDCB_CHECK
                    -check if the fd is free. If an error is returned,
                    the fd is marked as used in the AMITCP/IP
                    structures.
 
          The AMITCP/IP calls the callback every time a socket
          descriptor is allocated or freed. AMITCP/IP uses the
          FDCB_CHECK before actual allocation to check that it
          agrees with the link library on the next free descriptor
          number.  Thus the link library doesn't need to tell the
          AMITCP/IP if it creates a new file handle in open(), for
          example.
 
          See file _chkufb.c on the net.lib sources for an example
          implementation of the callback function for the SAS/C.
 
    SBTC_HERRNO
          The name resolver error code value. Get this to find out why
          the gethostbyname() or gethostbyaddr() failed. The values are
          defined in &lt;netdb.h&gt;.
 
    SBTC_HERRNOSTRPTR
          Returns host error string for error number in tag data.  Host
          error is set on unsuccessful gethostbyname() and
          gethostbyaddr() calls. See the file &lt;netdb.h&gt; for the
          symbolic definitions for the herrno valus.
 
          Notes for the SBTC_ERRNOSTRPTR apply also to this tag code.
 
    SBTC_IOERRNOSTRPTR
          Returns an error string for standard AmigaOS I/O error number
          as defined in the header file &lt;exec-errors.h&gt;.  Note that the
          error number taken by this tag code is positive, so the error
          codes must be negated (to be positive).  The positive error
          codes depend on the particular IO device, the standard
          Sana-II error codes can be retrieved by the tag code
          SBTC_S2ERRNOSTRPTR.
 
          Notes for the SBTC_ERRNOSTRPTR apply also to this tag code.
 
    SBTC_LOGFACILITY
          Facility code for the syslog messages as defined in
          &lt;sys/syslog.h&gt;.  Defaults to LOG_USER.
 
    SBTC_LOGMASK
          Sets the filter mask of the syslog messages.  By default the
          mask is 0xff, meaning that all messages are passed to the log
          system.
 
    SBTC_LOGSTAT
          Syslog options defined in &lt;sys/syslog.h&gt;.
 
    SBTC_LOGTAGPTR
          A pointer to a string which is used by Syslog() to mark
          individual syslog messages. This defaults to NULL, but is set
          to the name of the calling program by the autoinit code in
          netlib:autoinit.c.  This is for compatibility with pre-3.0
          programs.
 
    SBTC_S2ERRNOSTRPTR
          Returns an error string for a Sana-II specific I/O error code
          as defined in the header file &lt;devices-sana2.h&gt;.
 
          Notes for the SBTC_ERRNOSTRPTR apply also to this tag code.
 
    SBTC_S2WERRNOSTRPTR
          Returns an error string for a Sana-II Wire Error code as
          defined in the header file &lt;devices-sana2.h&gt;.
 
          Notes for the SBTC_ERRNOSTRPTR apply also to this tag code.
 
    SBTC_SIGEVENTMASK
          Tag data contains the signal mask to be sent to the
          application whenever notification about socket events is in
          order.  The default value for this is zero, inhibiting any
          event notifications.  The application must set this mask if
          it desires to be notified about asynchronous socket events.
          When the application receives the signal specified in the
          mask, it can use the function GetSocketEvents() to find out
          what happened.
 
    SBTC_SIGIOMASK
          The signals specified in the mask in the tag data are sent to
          the calling task when asynhronous I/O is to be notified. The
          default value is zero, i.e., no signals are sent. The signals
          in the mask are sent whenever something happens on the
          socket. This mechanism is compatible with the Unix SIGIO
          signal.
 
          Since AmigaOS signals may get combined, one signal may include
          notification for originally distinct events on the socket.
          One example of this is the reception of data and connection
          closure.
 
          Usage of the socket events (see GetSocketEvents()) is
          recommended over this because of the problem described above.
 
    SBTC_SIGURGMASK
          The signals specified in the mask in the tag data are sent to
          the calling task when notification about urgent data arrives.
          The default value is zero, i.e. no signals are sent. This
          mechanism is compatible with the Unix SIGURG signal.
 
          Note that this signal does not indicate the arrival of the
          actual out-of-band data. If the receive buffer of the socket
          is full, the urgent data can't even be received. Because of
          this the application may need to read some normal data off
          the socket before it can read the urgent data.
 
=== RESULT ===
     Returns 0 on success, and a (positive) index of the failing tag on
     error.  Note that the value 1 means first TagItem, 2 the second
     one, and so on.  The return value is NOT a C-language index, which
     are 0 based.




==Select==

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
extern LONG WaitSelect(rest);


int select(int nfds,fdset *readfds,rest) just like the header
{
return WaitSelect(rest);
}
&lt;/soruce&gt;





==Blocking==

if your problem was O_NONBLOCK than why dont you actually use that setnonblocking()
function to enable non-blocking I/O instead of directly calling fcntl()????

also you may want to use O_NDELAY
O_NONBLOCK and O_NDELAY are same if you can use O_NDELAY

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int setNonblocking(int fd)
{
int flags;

/* If they have O_NONBLOCK, use the Posix way to do it */
#if defined(O_NONBLOCK)
if (-1 == (flags = fcntl(fd, F_GETFL, 0)))
flags = 0;
return fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, flags | O_NONBLOCK);
#else
/* Otherwise, use the old way of doing it */
flags = 1;
return ioctl(fd, FIOBIO, &amp;flags);
#endif
}
&lt;/source&gt;

or 

 IoctlSocket(socket, FIONBIO, (char *) &amp;val);

I am quite sure that you miscalculated something in the following section.

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Dynamic_Studies_in_Nuclear_Medicine#Models_with_Three_Compartments

The argument is like this:

You wrote (mind the brackets):

q_3=-A_5*[exp(-l_1*t)-A_2*exp(-l_2*t)]

The model is such that

q_3(t=0)=0

This obviously means:

0=-A_5*[1-A_2]

The case A_5=0 is not interesting because it implies q_3(t)=0 for all times, which certainly does not describe the system we are interested in, so we can dived by A_5 yielding:

 1=A_2

But you wrote

A_2=0.35

thus we got a contradiction.

Yours Dirk Hünniger from German Wikibooks


I think the correct equation is.

q_3=-A_5*[exp(-l_1*t)-exp(-l_2*t)]

So just one A_2 removed.
I tried to calculate from scratch. I put up the differential equation and initial condition from the image showing the compartments and there paths of exchange:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{ccc}
q_1(t=0)&amp;=&amp;1 \\
q_2(t=0)&amp;=&amp;0 \\
q_3(t=0)&amp;=&amp;0
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{ccc}
\overset{\text{ }}{\frac{\mathrm{d} q_1}{\mathrm{d} t}}&amp;=&amp;-\left( k_{13} + k_{12} \right) \cdot q_1 + k_{31} q_3  \\
\overset{\text{ }}{\frac{\mathrm{d} q_2}{\mathrm{d} t}}&amp;=&amp; k_{12} \cdot q_1  \\
\overset{\text{ }}{\frac{\mathrm{d} q_3}{\mathrm{d} t}}&amp;=&amp; k_{13} \cdot q_1 - k_{31} q_3
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

This is differential equation of the form:

\frac{dq}{dt}=B q

where q is a vector and B is Matrix.  Wikipedia says that the solution is easy to get if you know the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of B.

So I put that into wolfram:

http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=eigenvalues({{(-b-a)%2C0%2Cc}%2C{a%2C0%2C0}%2C{b%2C0%2C-c}})

and had a close look at the result.

== Renography ==


I think the Section
 
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Dynamic_Studies_in_Nuclear_Medicine#Renography

is wrong.

I was trying to figure out the equations and I don't see that they are right.
There are a few problems.

First of all I can understand it for t&lt;t0 up to a certain extend. It is just like in the three compartment model and this is basically Ok.
But for t&gt;t0 it turns wired. q4 decreases in a monotonous manner. This ok. But the rate of decrease is governed by l1 and l2. But l1 and l2 are function of k12, k13 and k31 an not other parameters. But the decrease of the concentration of the tracer must depend on exchange rates between the compartment 4, 5 and 6 too. So this is why I don't believe in this equation. I propose to use a model of five compartments, specifically 1,3,4,5 and 6 and calculate that with the methods I have given here:

http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Physikalische_Grundlagen_der_Nuklearmedizin/_Mathematischer_Anhang

The differential equation I propose is given by the following image:

[[File:FiveCompartmentModelInRenography-de.svg|center|thumb|400px]]

Since we got five compartments, this might lead to a polynomial of degree 5. So we might not be able to solve for the eigenvalues. But if we are lucky it might work. Otherwise we can still calculate things in a numeric manner using the same approach.

Independent of the exact method of solution we are going to choose it seems very important to me to write down the differential equations we are going to solve, which is not yet done for this case.

[[User:Dirk Hünniger|Dirk Hünniger]] ([[User talk:Dirk Hünniger|talk]]) 08:26, 10 April 2010 (UTC)

=== Results ===
I did the proposed calculation.
It is written down here:

http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Physikalische_Grundlagen_der_Nuklearmedizin/_Mathematischer_Anhang#Renographie

it is lengthy and not very interesting.
The resulting Plots are here:

http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Physikalische_Grundlagen_der_Nuklearmedizin/_Dynamische_Studien_in_Nuklearmedizin#Renographie

There is one interesting point that is different between the two models.

Kierans models says:

&quot;There is a door from the renal parenchyma to the renal pelvis. In the beginning this door is closed, and the tracer is located in the intravascular compartment. Thus it accumulates in the renal parenchyma by flow from the intravascular compartment. After two minutes the door opens. Now there is a big flow from the renal parenchyma to the renal pelvis and from there to the bladder, this flow is bigger than the flow from the intravascular compartment to the renal parenchyma. So the concentration of the tracer in the kidney decreases&quot;

--Kieran complained that I misquoted him here. And he is very angry with me because of what I wrote here. But this is how I understand his model.

My Model says:

&quot;There is no door. The tracer accumulates in the kidney by flow from the intravascular compartment. There is also a flow from the intravascular compartment to  extravascular compartment and this is really large. So the tracer leaves the intravascular compartment to the extravascular compartment and thus the concentration of the tracer in the intravascular compartment deceases rapidly. Thus there is no input to the kidney from the intravascular compartment anymore and so the concentration of the tracer in the kidney decreases&quot;

So to put is simply:
* Kieran says the flow leaving the kidney increases.
* I say the flow into the kindey decreases

It may also help people with milder or short-term depression, or people wanting to help someone else with depression. It does not explore the possible causes of depression or go into great detail about medical treatments available. It is not meant to replace any professional advice or treatment. It is essentially a self-help guide with practical ideas on how people can improve the quality of their lives.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is thought that clinical depression will affect up to 1 in 4 of us at some point in our lives. Depression is more than just sadness or feeling &quot;a bit down in the dumps&quot;. It can be a long term condition with no obvious cause and with debilitating symptoms including extremely low mood, low self-esteem, being  unable to take pleasure in things, poor concentration, insomnia, anxiety, low energy, stamina and feelings of worthlessness or hopelessness.

For many people, depression is a long-term condition. There are various treatments but a cure is often hard to find. Facing a future with depression can sometimes seem bleak or hopeless. This book is not intended to be a definitive answer of how to &quot;get better&quot; from depression, but for those that have been depressed for a long time, to help you live with depression. Each of the ideas in this Wikibook may or may not work for you, by they won't hurt you either. Chances are there will be no one &quot;answer&quot;; each suggestion might help just a little bit. By attacking your depression from every possible angle, and trying as many things you can think of, you just might find life worth living again.
