      <text xml:space="preserve">This is only my second contribution and I am unfamiliar with the process and not yet confident about making contributions. Please be gentle with me! I think there is an error on this page but I dont want to make the change without first discussing it. The section is that of Pixels.
The text says &quot;When representing text, each pixel is one character (for example, a letter, a number, a space, or a new line).&quot; My reading of this is that a character is represented by a single pixel which doesnt seem possible to me. Perhaps the original author could comment here and clarify exactly where my misunderstandings lie or redraft the section.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As always, contributions are welcome.  We ask, however, that major changes be discussed on the book's [[Talk:PyGTK For GUI Programming|talk page]] and that the following points be observed for sake of consistency:

* Python source code should be placed between the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot; line&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags.
* The &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Navigation}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template should be placed at the bottom of each page, e.g:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Navigation|Book=PyGTK For GUI Programming|previous=Introduction|current=First Steps|next=Events}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
(Note the capital 'B' in book and lower case first letters for the other arguments - the template only works this way.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">As you learned in the previous chapter, signals are emitted by widgets to allow your application to respond to specific actions, for example a button press.  These responses are created by writing a function in the form:

 def callback_func(widget, callback_data=None)

and registering it with a specific widget and signal by using the widget's '''connect''' method:

 widget.connect(signal_name, callback_function, callback_data)

where '''signal_name''' is a string indicating the name of the signal to respond to, '''callback_function''' is a reference to your callback function (without brackets and arguments), and '''callback_data''' is an optional arbitrary object to pass to your callback function.

If you are structuring your application inside a Python class, as demonstrated in the previous chapter, then your callback 'method' will need an additional argument as a reference to the class instance:

 class App:
     ... snip ...
     def callback_method(&lt;strong&gt;self&lt;/strong&gt;, widget, callback_data):
        ... snip ...

For organizational purposes it is often advisable to group all your callback methods at the end of the class, or to suffix them with '''_callback'''.

== Events ==
GTK+ '''events''' are similar to '''signals''':  they are 'emitted' by specific widgets and can be handled by callback functions.  The only differences as far as the PyGTK programmer is concerned are the arguments to a callback function and its return value.  As an example, we'll use the 'button_pressed_event' emitted by the '''gtk.Button''' widget, which can be connected to a callback function the same way a signal is:

 button.connect('button_press_event', callback_func, callback_data)

where '''button''' is an instance of the '''gtk.Button''' object.  The '''callback_data''' argument, as explained in the previous chapter, is optional.  The definition of the callback function contains three arguments:  a reference to the widget that emitted the signal, the event and the callback data:

 def callback_func(widget, event, callback_data=None)

The value returned from this function '''must''' be a boolean value (unlike callback functions for signals).  This return value is an important message in the GTK+ event mechanism:

* '''False''' means that the event was not fully processed so GTK+ should continue doing whatever it usually does when this event occurs and the signal should propagate further.
* '''True''' means that the event ''was'' fully handled and GTK+ no longer needs to do any further processing in response to the event.

As an example, the 'delete_event' event is emitted from a '''gtk.Window''' when the user tries to close the window;  if we connect a callback function to this and the function returns False, GTK+ will go on to close the window and emit the 'destroy' signal.  If our callback function returns True, however, GTK+ ''does not'' close the window itself or emit the 'destroy' signal.  This allows us to intervene when someone tries to close a window so we have to opportunity to ask them if, for example, they want to save their work, and then either instruct GTK+ to close the window or leave it open by returning the appropriate values from our callback function.

== GTK+ main loop ==
The GTK+ toolkit is known as 'event-driven' because it sleeps in a loop until a signal or event is emitted, at which point it adds the signal to the end of a '''queue'''.   Another part of GTK+ takes signals from the top of the queue, one at a time, and runs whatever callback functions are registered with the signal or event before moving to the next item in the queue.  This is why you need to run the '''gtk.main()''' function, which serves to prevent your application from halting as soon as it has set up the GUI, and run any callback functions you have registered with '''.connect()''' when signals and events are emitted.

It is important to note, however, that GTK+ does not run callback functions in new threads;  if one callback function takes a long time to run, then the rest of the GUI will remain unresponsive until that function finishes.  Below is a quick example to demonstrate this point:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot; line&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env python

import pygtk
pygtk.require('2.0')
import gtk
import time

class App:
    def __init__(self):
        self.window = gtk.Window(type=gtk.WINDOW_TOPLEVEL)
        self.hbox = gtk.HBox()
        self.button_print = gtk.Button(label='Print something')
        self.button_sleep = gtk.Button(label='Hang for 5 seconds')

        self.hbox.pack_start(self.button_print)
        self.hbox.pack_start(self.button_sleep)

        self.button_print.connect('clicked', self.print_hi)
        self.button_sleep.connect('clicked', self.sleep)
        self.window.connect('destroy', self.quit)
        
        self.window.add(self.hbox)
        self.window.show_all()

        gtk.main()

    def print_hi(self, widget, callback_data=None):
        print 'Hi there!'

    def sleep(self, widget, callback_data=None):
        time.sleep(5)

    def quit(self, widget, callback_data=None):
        gtk.main_quit()

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    app = App()
&lt;/source&gt;

[[File:Pygtk hang example.png|right|thumb|400px]]

If you run the program above from a terminal, you should see a window with two buttons.  Pressing the first button causes 'Hi there!' to be printed on the terminal.  If you press the second button, the callback function hangs for five seconds, meaning that by pressing the second button and then the first in quick succession, the 'Hi there!' message won't be printed until 5 seconds has passed, demonstrating how signals are added to the queue which are executed one at a time.

:''&quot;In PHP5 a constructor must be declared as public or it will not work.&quot;''
Is this true? In some design patterns (e.g. factory method) it's common to have a private constructor that's called only by public static methods. I believe PHP supports this.--[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|talk]]) 15:02, 13 August 2010 (UTC)</text>

He is no longer involved, this project is run by a volunteers. Last version was released in 2007 april in [http://sourceforge.net/projects/qvwm/ sourceforge].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Leases'''
A lease is a contractual arrangement by which a ''lessor/owner'' provides a ''lessee/user'' the right to use an asset for a specified period of time. In return, the lessee agrees to make periodic cash payments during the term of the lease. An apartment lease is a typical rental agreement referred to as an ''operating lease'' in which the fundamental rights and responsibilities of ownership are retained by the lessor. ''Capital leases''(Direct financing or sales-type leases to the lessor) are contracts that are formulated outwardly as leases, but in reality are installment purchases/sales.
Typically,
&lt;u&gt;Lessee&lt;/u&gt;:
1.Operating Lease
2.Capital 
&lt;u&gt;Lessor&lt;/u&gt;:
1.Operating Lease
2.Direct Financing Lease
or Sales-type lease
Leasing sometimes is used as a means of off-balance-sheet financing. Operational, tax, and financial market incentives often make leasing an attractive alternative to purchasing.

&lt;big&gt;Lease Classification&lt;/big&gt;
'''Capital Leases''': A lessee should classify a lease transaction as a capital lease if it includes a noncancelable lease term and one or more of the four criteria listed are met. Otherwise, it is an operating lease.
1. The agreement specifies that ownership of the asset transfers to the lessee.
2. The agreement contains a bargain purchase option.
3. The noncancelable lease term is equal to 75% or more of the expected economic life of the asset.
4. The present value of the minimum lease payments is equal to or greater than 90% of the fair value of the asset.

A '''Bargain purchase option (BPO)''' is a provision in the lease contract that gives the lessee the option of purchasing the leased property at a bargain price. This is defined as a price sufficiently lower than the expected fair value of the property that the exercise of the option appears reasonably assured at the inception of the lease.

'''Expected economic life''': If an asset is leased for most of its useful life, then most of the benefits and responsibilities of ownership are transferred to the lessee. 75% or more of the expected economic life of the asset is threshold point for this purpose.

'''Bargain renewal options''' gives the lessee the option to renew the lease at a bargain rate. That is, the rental payment is sufficiently lower than the expected fair rental of the property at the date the option becomes exercisable that exercise of the option appears reasonably assured.  

'''Minimum lease payments''': If the lease payments required by a lease contract substantially pay for a leased asset, it is logical to identify the arrangement as a lease contract substantially pay for a leased asset, it is logical to identify the arrangement as a lease equivalent to an installment purchase. It is considered to exist when the present value of the minimum lease payments is equal to or greater than 90% of the fair value of the asset at the inception of the lease.
&lt;big&gt;Additional Lessor Conditions&lt;/big&gt;
1. The collectibility of the lease payments must be reasonably predictable.
2. If any costs to the lessor have yet to be incurred, they are reasonably predictable. (Performance by the lessor is substantially complete.)

'''Operating Lease'''
If a lease does not met any of the criteria for a capital lease it is considered to be more in the nature of a rental agreement and is referred to as an ''operating lease''. In an operating lease, rent is recognized on a straight-line basis unless another systematic method more clearly reflects the benefits of the asset's use. So, if rental payments are uneven-for instance, if rent increases are scheduled-the total scheduled payments ordinarily would be expensed equally over the lease term.
&lt;u&gt;Advance Payments&lt;/u&gt;
Often lease agreements call for advance payments to be made at the inception of the lease that represent prepaid rent. For instance, it is common for a lessee to pay a bonus in return for negotiating more favorable lease terms. Such payments are recorded as prepaid rent and allocated( normally on a straight-line basis ) to rent expense/rent revenue over the lease term. Sometimes advance payments include security deposits that are refundable at the expiration of the lease or prepayments of the last period's rent. Rent payments may be scheduled to increase periodically over the lease term. The total rent over the term of the lease is allocated to individual periods on a straight-line basis. As a result, the temporarily unpaid portion of rent expense must be credited to deferred rent expense payable until later in the lease term when rent payments exceed rent expense.

On January 1, 2010, Doogin Wagon, Inc., a computer services firm, leased a printer from ElernZac Corporation. The lease agreement specifies four annual payments of $100,000 beginning January 1, 2010, the inception of the lease, and at each January 1 thereafter through 2013. The useful life of the printer is estimated to be eight years. Before deciding to lease, Doogin Wagon considered purchasing the printer for its cash price of $625,000. If funds were borrowed to buy the copier, the interest rate would have been 10%.
1. Does the agreement specify a ownership transfer?
2. Does the agreement contain a bargain purchase option?
3. Is the lease term equal to 75% or more of the expected economic life of the asset?
4. Is the present value of the minimum lease payments equal to or greater than 90% of the fair value of the printer?
5. How should this lease be classified?

'''ANSWER''':
1. Does the agreement specify a ownership transfer?
''NO''

2. Does the agreement contain a bargain purchase option?
''NO''

3. Is the lease term equal to 75% or more of the expected economic life of the asset?
''4 years &lt; 75% of 8 years''
''4 years &lt; 6 years''
''NO''

4. Is the present value of the minimum lease payments equal to or greater than 90% of the fair value of the printer?
''$100,000 x 3.48685 (Table 6, n=4, i=10%)= $348,685''
''$348,685 &lt; 90% of $625,000''=''$348,685 &lt; $562,500''

5. How should this lease be classified?
''Since none of the four classification criteria is met, this is an operating lease.''</text>

{{TODO|&amp;bull; develop text&lt;br&gt;&amp;bull; move to new page [[GLPK/Software profiling and performance optimization]]}}

__FORCETOC__

== Background ==

At the end of 2012, a [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-glpk/2012-12/msg00081.html discussion] on code development sparked on the &lt;tt&gt;[help-glpk]&lt;/tt&gt; mailing list.  The initial comments covered solver algorithms, including numerical methods, and multi-core execution.  After some deliberation, it was agreed that concurrent processing was unlikely to yield much in the way of advantage, but that that algorithmic development under serial processing had a lot to offer.  Andrew Makhorin suggested that the split was something like 20/80%.

The title of this page indicates a focus on improving the numerical methods specifically and the run-time performance more generally.  This should not preclude improvements to the solver algorithms being considered, but the emphasis is classic software performance optimization.

The issue of thread-safe execution &amp;mdash; related to multi-core execution but also different in important ways &amp;mdash; was assign its own workflow and wikibook page entitled [[GLPK/The_thread-safety_question|the thread-safety question]].  Unless circumstances dictate otherwise, this separation will be maintained.

== Purpose of this page ==

The purpose of this page (and any subsequent sub-pages) is to summarize the discussion and any consensus decisions that arise.
It is also a place where key literature can be recorded for easy reference.

Contentious issues should be debated and resolved on the &lt;tt&gt;[help-glpk]&lt;/tt&gt; list first and should not be &quot;discussed&quot; here using this page as a vehicle.

== General requirements ==

GLPK is multi-platform and solutions should also be applicable across common environments including Linux, the UNIXes, Mac OS&amp;nbsp;X, and Microsoft Windows.  These days, mobile platforms should be considered, including [[w:Android_(operating_system)|Google Android]], [[w:Ios|Mac IOS]], and [[w:Windows_Phone|Microsoft Windows Phone]].  The use of [[w:Graphics_processing_unit|graphics processing units]] has been excluded.

== Development tools ==

I'm interested in creating a page/book/chapter about &quot;[[Collage]]&quot;. Is there any book that already contains it?

:I don't think so.  You can check in [[Subject:Visual arts]] to be sure, but I don't see any book that contains this topic.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A collage (From the French: coller, to glue) is a work of formal art, primarily in the visual arts, made from an assemblage of different forms, thus creating a new whole.
A collage may include newspaper clippings, ribbons, bits of colored or hand-made papers, portions of other artwork, photographs and found objects, glued to a piece of paper or canvas. 
&lt;ref&gt;*Collage. In Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Retrieved August 14, 2010, from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collage&lt;/ref&gt; This is a guide to show you some techniques for making a collage and provide you with some ideas.

==Materials==
Typical materials for collages are newspaper cutouts, postcards, photographs, packaging, ornamental paper, book pages, colored or hand-made paper, yarn, cloth, printed tissue, or pieces of other artworks. Start collecting anything collage-able you like that comes into your hands.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The materials used in a collage decide much upon its outcome. 

==Materials==
Possible materials for collages are:
*Printed things, such as
**newspaper cutouts 
**postcards
**photographs
**pieces of other artworks
**printed tissue
**pieces of other artworks
**ornamental paper

*Art supplies, like
**colored paper
**hand-made paper
**papers of different grains, textures, weights

*Found/Household items, for example
**yarn
**cloth
**packaging
**tin
**CDs

*Natural items, although somewhat less typical:
**wood
**pressed leaves and flowers
**sand
**wool
**rocks

===Acquisition thereof===
Start collecting anything collage-able you like that comes into your hands. Skim mail advertisements for usable material. You can also order catalogs from home furnishers, garden stores, etc., which most companies offer for free.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== RSS Weather, News and Sports feed ==

&lt;p&gt;So you want your Leaf to tell you what the weather is like and the forecast for tomorrow?
Thanks to Dr. Bruce and Mr. Gary Malolepsy this is easy.
The RSS function also allows for news and sport news to be read and I will show you the commands in the end. (For some reason the sports function seems to be broken at the moment, I will update if/when I get it working)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just follow these instructions and you will have Leaf telling you weather and news in no time.&lt;br /&gt;
I assume you have a working copy of the Leaf AI platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, make backup copies of the following files that we will be editing:
* Leaf.lisp
* Leaf Interface.lisp
* Speech.xml
&lt;/p&gt;	

&lt;p&gt;You are going to need the RSS package from the Yahoo Leaf group at http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/leaf_an_AI_robot/files/ scroll down and you will find it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Download and unzip the RSS.lisp to your Leaf folder and the IMessDLL.dll into your system folder (c:\windows\system32)
Open up your Speech.xml and add &lt;P&gt;forecast&lt;/P&gt; under the line that says &lt;P&gt;this is a dragon&lt;/P&gt;
You can now save and close the file.&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;forecast&quot; is going to be our keyword for making Leaf download and tell us what the weather is like and forecast tomorrows weather.&lt;br /&gt;
Now open up RSS.lisp and copy everything with ctrl+a and then ctrl+c to copy everything into your computers clipboard, then open your Leaf Interfaces.lisp and scroll to the bottom where you will paste the clipboard into Leaf Interfaces.lisp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save and then hit compile in your File menu.&lt;br /&gt;
Close Leaf Interfaces.lisp and open Leaf.lisp, because we're now going to add the function that tells Leaf to listen for the keyword &quot;forecast&quot; and what to do when he hears it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, open up Leaf.lisp and use the find function, it's in the Edit menu.
Write &quot;this is Bart&quot; without the &quot;&quot; characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can copy and paste this section under the bart function:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 ((string-equal *text-phrase*
                (concatenate 'string robot &quot; forecast&quot;))  ;behavior
 (setf *text-phrase* nil)
 (weather YOURZIP))
&lt;/pre&gt;

Just change YOURZIP to your local zip code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To also make Leaf able to tell you news, add this code under the last one you made:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 ((string-equal *text-phrase*
                (concatenate 'string robot &quot; news&quot;))  ;behavior
 (setf *text-phrase* nil)
 (News))
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;And add &lt;P&gt;news&lt;/P&gt; to your Speech.xml under &lt;P&gt;forecast&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now compile Leaf.lisp using the File menu.&lt;br /&gt;
There you have it, Leaf can now tell you the local weather and tomorrows forecast as well as the latest news.&lt;/p&gt;

: (note) No that does not make sense, please just erase the answers to the question in the requirements for the Citizenhip in the World merit badge Wikibook think here.  It's better if it's erased so kids don't use those answers when they should be doing the work themselves.

:: It is easy for somebody assessing work (whether a child's or an adult's) to check if they have plagiarized the answer. All assessors need to do this because the information to answer any question is easily available on the Internet. In the case of your edits, it is custom and practice within this Wikibook to include the answers. While you may disagree with this, just erasing them (repeatedly) is not the way to approach it once other people have started to revert your edits. The best way is probably to start a discussion on the talk page of the book to explain why you think the answers should be removed. However, as I-20 states, the overarching princple is that we do not censor content so removing something because it might be &quot;misused&quot; is unlikely to ever succeed as an argument, but feel free to try. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:55, 15 August 2010 (UTC)
Okay I understand, thanks, but also I was trying to fix some answers up and make them better than they were originally (this was before I did the crazy erasing) and I was actually making the answers more elaborate and better.  I don't understand why they were erased, because I turned a three word sentence into a paragraph with better detail.
:It may have been reverted by mistake. The rollback tool will reverse all sequential edits by one person, so if you expanded an answer, then deleted something else (for example), the person trying to revert your removal may have accidentally removed all your changes. Anyway, I've removed your block as requested. If you're trying to improve the answers, please go ahead and do so. Thanks. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 23:37, 15 August 2010 (UTC)
Okay, thanks you for working with me, and I'm sorry for my misdoings and will take what you said and I will try to do things more appropriately now.  Thank you again for you time and cooperation.</text>

Working to develop digital literacy, digital information literacy, and online networking skills with teachers instead of, or before working with students may be less productive than working with students directly. This is an interesting proposition made by [http://hedc.otago.ac.nz/magnolia/RussellButson/About-Me/Publications.html Russell Butson], working in the Higher Education Development Centre (HEDC) at Otago University. It is possible that a large proportion of the teaching staff will feel they have more to lose by participating in open education through social media. It may, therefore, be more productive to work with students who arguably have more to gain in developing digital literacy and online networking skills, given their relatively early career stages. By working directly with students it may help to benefit their learning objectives and career aspirations sooner, while helping teachers to observe more objectively the benefits and pitfalls to these new communication skills. Discussions continue with Russell Butson regarding his research into this approach to Educational Development.


Did wiki use increase between 2007 to 2009? &quot;This number was expected to increase when the teacher training schedules used by Otago Polytechnic started to include orientation and skills development in the use of wikis as well as a number of other publishing platforms and media sharing services.&quot; 

Leigh which is true - from Introduction/Otago Polytechnic's initial steps

''Otago Polytechnic is a small public education and training institution in the South of New Zealand that graduates an average of 1,987 students per year.''

OR from Development/About Otago Polytechnic

''The Otago Polytechnic is a public New Zealand tertiary education institute that graduates around 4500 students per year.''--[[User:Bronwynh|Bronwynh]] ([[User talk:Bronwynh|talk]]) 04:33, 15 August 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The overview for the Development chapter needs another paragraph outlining how the impact of OER was measured. Was it just the AKO research or other methods as well? --[[User:Bronwynh|Bronwynh]] ([[User talk:Bronwynh|talk]]) 04:39, 15 August 2010 (UTC)

The benefits of using wikis are described in two different chapters - I can see the difference - in the Introduction it is to do with content development perspectives of staff whereas in the Development chapter it is more about organisational perspective and infrastructure, so I have changed the title in the Introduction chapter to: ==Benefits for using wikis in content development==

[[Open_Education_Practices:_A_User_Guide_for_Organisations/Resources_and_Practices#Benefits_of_using_wikis|Benefits of using wikis]]

    * Open access to resources making them easily reusable on other platforms;
    * Information which is easy to edit, making development much more participatory, rather than reliant on developers;
    * Improved usability provided by a standardised interface helping to ensure a base line quality standard;
    * Version control and records of edit history which are always available;
    * Communication channels behind every level of content where participants can leave messages for collaborators;
    * Changes to the way staff in an organisation share content and ideas, leading to a participatory culture in open educational resource development.

[[Open_Education_Practices:_A_User_Guide_for_Organisations/Educational_Development#Working_with_Wikis|Working with wikis]]

Benefits of using wikis from the organisational perspective include:

    * Free content hosting;
    * Free and supported access to MediaWiki software;
    * Exposure, promotion and networking with other educational organisations;
    * Internationalisation and dialog with the others interested in educational development;
    * Collaborative development opportunities and resource sharing;
    * Open access to learning resources;
    * Staff development of MediaWiki editing skills that are transferable to more popular MediaWiki based projects like Wikipedia.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Introduction to Tax Accounting===

[http://www.fasb.org/summary/stsum109.shtml SAFA #109], [http://asc.fasb.org/home&amp;u=MDgtMTUtMjAxMDswNTo0MjtBQUE1MTA0OTtTVU5ZLU9zd2Vnbzs4Q0Q1NDJBQjMzQUU2QkI0RUJGMDk4QTQxQTM5NUY0QQ== 740-10-25-20]

Although most of the information on a company’s income tax return comes from the income statement, there often is a difference between pretax income and taxable income.  These differences are due to the recording requirements of GAAP for financial accounting (usually following matching principle and allowing accruals of revenue and expenses) and the requirements of the IRS’s tax regulations for tax accounting (which are more oriented to cash). Such timing differences between financial accounting and tax accounting create temporary differences.  Also there are events, usually one-time, which create &quot;permanent differences&quot;, such as GAAP recognizing as expense an item which the IRS will not allow to be deducted.

===Temporary Differences===
A temporary difference between pretax financial accounting income and taxable income often creates the amount to be included in taxable income one or two years before or after the revenue or expense was realized in financial accounting.  Recording in this matter, in turn, creates a difference of the amount that is recorded of an asset or a liability on the financial statements. Items that create temporary differences include:
    •	Installment sales
    •	Unrealized gain on recorded investments
    •	Rent collected in advance
    •	Subscriptions collected in advance
    •	Revenue collected in advance
    •	Estimated expenses and loses
    •	Unrealized loss from recorded investments at fair value
    •	Differences in recording method for depreciation
    •	Prepaid tax deductable expenses
These temporary differences create either a deferred tax liability or a deferred tax asset.

===Deferred Tax Liability===

A deferred tax liability is best described as “a liability that represents the increase in taxes payable in future years as a result of taxable temporary differences existing at the end of the current year” (Kieso, Weygandt, &amp; Warfield, 2007, p. 967).

For example: The Cram Corporation sold property worth $100 million on January 1, 2009. Terms included $25 million installments each year starting on January 1, 2009 and the final payment to be made on January 1, 2012.
 
Example of a sale creating a deferred tax liability that is a temporary difference
  ($ in millions)          Originates	     Reverses	        
  Year	                     2009     2010   2011  2012   Total
  Pretax Accounting Income    $200     $150   $125  $100   $575
  Installment sale of land   ($100)     0      0      0   ($100)
  Installment income of sale   $25      $25    $25   $25   $100
  Taxable income	      $125     $175   $150  $125   $575


In this example the pretax income vary from the taxable income for that given year due to differences in recognition of the sale of the land. Remember, according to GAAP, revenue is recognized when earned, but the IRS recognizes revenue when it is received for tax accounting.

===Deferred Tax Asset===

The opposite is true of a deferred tax asset. This is best described as a “deferred tax asset represents the increase in taxes refundable (or saved) in future years as a result of deductible temporary differences existing at the end of the current year” (Kieso, Weygandt, &amp; Warfield, 2007, p. 970).
For example: The Cram Corporation 2009 income statement included a warranty expense valued at $50 million that is deducted when paid in 2010 and 2011.

Example of a expense creating a deferred tax asset that is temporary in nature
         ($ in millions)    Originates   Reverses   
  Year	                       2009	 2010  2011   Total	
  Pretax accounting income     $200	 $150  $125    $475
  Expense on income statement   $50		        $50
  Expense on tax return	          0	 ($25) ($25)   (50)
  Taxable income 	       $250	  $125  $100   $475

In this example the expense on tax return is representative of a future tax benefit from reversing a temporary difference in warranty expense that is paid in the current year.

===Permanent Differences===
One permanent difference arises when a firm has engaged in illegal activity, and has incurred expenses that are real in GAAP terms but are disallowed by the IRS.  For example the payment of fines to the government for illegal activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Kedoshim  Leviticus 19:1- 20:27

&quot;And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying, Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Yisrael, and say unto them, You shall be Holy: for I Yahweh your Elohim am holy.   You shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my Sabbaths: I am Yahweh your Elohim.   Turn you not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am Yahweh your Elohim. &quot;   Leviticus 19:1-4

'Thus you are to be holy to Me, for I Yahweh am holy; and I have set you apart from the peoples to be Mine'  Leviticus :26).

The word qodesh in Hebrew is the equivalent of holy and means to 'separate' or 'a setting apart from'.    This means that when something is 'set apart' it is no longer available for general use, but separated and designated specifically for Yahweh.  Likewise, when a man marries and puts the ring on his bride's finger, he proclaims, &quot;With this act you have become sanctified to me - separated from the entire world and specifically designated only for me.&quot;

Kedoshim means holy, set aside for a special purpose, different from others.   When He demands of His people to be holy, He means that they must elevate themselves above the mundane materialistic world and conduct themselves in an exalted way which reflects His holiness.  

The overriding premise of Kedoshim begins and closes with the admonition to the children of Israel to be holy, for Yahweh is holy. In between is a list of 'dos and don'ts' that promote this requirement for the pursuit of holiness.  From simple ways to handle harvest, labor and foreign relations, to restrictions about occult and deviant sexual activity, the wide variety of instructions are all designed to set apart a sanctified people for the pleasure of Yahweh.


The parashah  deals with issues of holiness:

19:3 Parents				19:4 Idols				19:5-8 Holy meat

19:9-11 Property			19:12 Swearing				19:13-15 Oppression

19:16-18 Gossip/ Hate/Vengeance		19:19 Mixed crops/cattle		19:20-22 Relations with a slave

19:23-25 Fruit of the land		19:26 Blood/ divination			19:27-28 Hair/ tattoos/cuttings

19:29 Child concubinage			19:30 Shabbat				19:31 Spiritism

19:32 Honoring elderly			19:33-34 Protecting aliens		19:35-37 Just measures

20:1-5 Molech/ child sacrifice		20:6-8 Spiritism			20:9 Cursing parents

20:10 Adultery				20:11-12 Incest				20:13-21 Sexual sins


As one meditates upon each of these mitzvot(commandments), a sense of protection from the wickedness of the world system comes to mind.  Even though the thought of participating in many of these activities has never been considered, the sad reality is these depraved activities do occur in many civilizations.  Sadly, even in the Judeo/Christian culture of America, the laxity of moral codes and basic human ethics is fostering a proliferation of many of these formerly illegal actions.  One could readily conclude from observing the society that surrounds us that we are definitely in the Last Days that Paul warned Timothy about in his final epistle.

'But know this, that in the last days hard times will come. For men will be lovers of themselves,lovers of money, boastful, arrogant,blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful,unholy, without natural affection,irreconcilable, malicious slanderers, without self-control, brutal, haters of good, betrayers,reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God; holding to a form of piety, although they have denied its power; and turn away from such men as these ' (2 Timotheos/Timothy 3:1-5).

When you take a look at this list of how men would behave in the Last Days, you can readily detect that each of these despicable end-time characteristics are almost part and parcel with men ignoring the list of commandments detailed in Kedoshim.

Rather than focus on all of the negative aspects of Kedoshim, one small section of the reading had to do with actions among the people, brethren and neighbors of Israel.  The positive commandments about how we should treat our neighbors is something that we will consider, as the distinction of our walk with the Messiah of Israel should testify that we are indeed the people of Israel.
 
When Yeshua came to us, He came as the Holy One of God. The disciples of Yeshua called Him by this title. (John 6:69) Even the demons recognized Him as the Holy One of God. (Mark 1:24)
Yeshua is called the Holy One of God because His holiness is derived directly from obeying the Father's commandments.   He said, “I do nothing on My own initiative, but I speak these things as the Father taught Me.” (John 8:28) And again he says, “I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love.” (John 15:10)  He always did the Father's will  (Luke 22:42)  He was the embodiment of the Word of God, the commandments lived out in a human being,  as He said,  “He who has seen me, has seen the Father.” (John 14:9), because the commandments are an expression of the nature and character of God.  They are a revelation of godliness (God-like-ness).
Therefore by keeping His commandments, we are conforming ourselves to His standards of behaviour and become reflections of His character and nature - His person, being holy, as He is holy.

Not that we become god-like by an external performance of the commandments given to us, but that when we do them from the heart as an act of obedience, His Word by the operation of His Spirit, sanctifies us (i.e. makes us holy), as Yeshua said, &quot;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him&quot;.   His Word is the Father's commandments which He kept.
We become holy by His indwelling presence as a result of keeping the Word of God.  John 14:15-23; 17:17


&lt;u&gt;Obeying the Commandments&lt;/u&gt;

The holiness that Yahweh sets before us, therefore, in the passage of scripture above, can only be accomplished by setting oneself apart from all that is sinful, impure, and morally imperfect.   The Torah tells us that we are to become holy in every area of our lives.  Yahweh's concern in all the instructions that He gives us is that we would not think like, worship like or live like the nations around about us.   He called His people to be to be radically different so that they were a testimony and a reflection of His own nature and character.  The essential attributes of holiness, which is the nature of God, requires putting forth a diligent effort on our part, and will require an exertion of one’s own free will to achieve, involving the denial of our own inclinations and reasonings which have been formed by those around us.   

The holiness of Yahweh is the essential attribute of His divine nature.   All moral law and perfection have its eternal origin and unchangeable basis in His own nature.   Therefore, His eternal holiness revealed to men sets before them the highest goal of their aspiration, their hope, and their endeavor to honor and live before His divine presence. 

The motivation of the instruction to be holy is centred in the fact that He is holy.   We are to be imitators of Him who called us out of darkness into His marvellous light.    We do not earn merit or greater acceptance with Him by obeying His commands to separate ourselves from all that is contrary to Him.    His love is unconditional toward us and is based on the merits of Yeshua's atonement for us alone and not by any attempt on our part to gain favour with God.   But we are able to come closer to Him when we remove the unclean things which separate us from Him.   Isaiah 59: 1-2

Our motivation should be that because He is holy and He is our Father, in love we want to respond to His goodness to us and be like Him, and bless Him with our obedience to His commands, which are for our good.
By so doing we honour His parental care of us and magnify Him in the sight of the world.

Many of the commandments were given so that the Hebrew people would be different from other nations and so that they would not look like the idol worshippers who used to shave off their sideburns and the corners of their beards or tattooing themselves, see Jeremiah 7:25-26.  Also that they would not practice their divination and sorcery.

Yeshua said,  &quot;You have heard it said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy’—  Loving your neighbor is a commandment from the parashah for this week (Lev 19:18).  Hating your enemy is not a biblical commandment.  Nor is it found in any Jewish literature.  What could Yeshua have been referring to?   Matthew 5:43-48

Hating the enemy in first century Judaism — It may very well have been that Yeshua referred to a popular saying, but one can easily see how he was referring to an attitude prevalent in first century Judaism: hatred for Rome (and for opposing religious and political parties).  One of Yeshua’s messages for his generation was to love the enemy, to turn the other cheek when insulted, and to go the extra mile when conscripted into labor. Israel was dominated by Rome for a reason — or not following God.  Yeshua taught that the way for Israel to be free from Rome was to follow God, not to start a revolution.

&quot;But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father in Heaven, because He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.   For if you love those loving you, what reward do you have.  Do not the tax-collectors do the same?  And if you greet your brethren only, what do you do more than others?  Do not even the tax collectors do so?   Therefore you be perfect,l, just as your Heavenly Father is perfect '   (Mattityahu/Matthew 5:43-48).

This is the measure of the standard of holiness which Yeshua set for His people.    This is the perfection of the law, which is the standard of holiness found in Yeshua, the express image of the Father's Person  -  the Word made flesh. We are called to allow His Word to dwell in us in all its fullness working out in us His holiness

We love, because he first loved us.&quot;(1 John 4:19HNV revised)  Our love is in direct proportion to the amount of love we have received from the Father.  In other words, if we cultivate our relationship with Him, we will be able to receive of His love and then we will be able to love our neighbor in the same way that we are loved by our Father.

Interestingly, He concludes this admonition by reminding His listeners that they needed to be perfect or holy, just as the Father is perfect or holy.  Of course this degree of holiness or perfection can only be obtained from the imputed righteousness available by the atoning blood of the Messiah.


&lt;u&gt;The Process of Becoming Holy&lt;/u&gt;

The last two Torah parashot have focused upon the mercy seat of Yahweh and its significance, with the blood of the sacrifice sprinkled upon the mercy seat representing that forgiveness of our sins is only possible by Yahweh’ grace and His mercy, and not because of any work that we have done.   We have come to understand that our sins are blotted out through substitutionary atonement.   This is also known as regeneration and justification.  
This imparts to us a new nature which is the first requirement to becoming 'holy'.    Without this impartation of His divine nature it is impossible to achieve god-like-ness through any of our own efforts.
Justification does not make one righteous, neither does it bestow righteousness, but rather what it does, is to declare a person potentially to be justified before Yahweh.   That is, our sins are remitted or put away from us by the sacrificial atonement of Yeshua in dying for us and being cleansed by His blood.  So the sinner now becomes righteous in Yahweh’ sight when he is in Messiah Yeshua.   Once we have become justified before Yahweh, we now need to become sanctified by setting ourselves apart from that which is sinful, impure, and morally imperfect.   There is a need to change our former lifestyle by taking heed to the Word of God and following its directions for living. 

Perhaps the most oft quoted reference is described in triplicate by the gospel accounts of Matthew,Mark, and Luke. When Yeshua was asked what the greatest commandment was he responded with the following coupling.
'Yeshua answered, 'The foremost is: 'Hear,O Yisrael! Adonai is our God; Adonai is one; and you shall love Adonai your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.
'The second is this: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'There is no other commandment greater than these.' And the scribe said to Him, 'Very well, Teacher, You have truly stated that He is One; and that there is no one else except Him;and to love Him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength,and to love one's neighbor as himself,abounds all the more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.' And when Yeshua saw that he had answered intelligently, He said to him, 'You are not far from the Kingdom of God.' And after that, no one had the courage to ask Him any more questions'  (Mark12:29-34).

If you look at these three separate passages you will detect that the two questions had three similar but not identical answers recorded by the three different gospel writers.  Each coupled the question about what was the greatest commandment or how might one inherit eternal life with the concept of loving the Father with all one's heart, mind, soul and strength. This was considered the First Commandment and the requirement to love one's neighbor as himself was coupled as the Second. 

So when you boil it all down, and consider the referenced verses in Kedoshim, they lay the very foundation for one of the most important commandments in the Holy Writ.  Many refer to this as the 'Golden Rule' or 'doing unto others what you would have them do unto you.'  Remember after loving our Heavenly Father, we are supposed to love our neighbor as ourselves.  If you take the time to do some introspection, you might realize that obedience to the second greatest commandment is more theory than reality in your life. 

&quot;We love, because he first loved us.&quot;(1 John 4:19HNV revised)  Our love is in direct proportion to the amount of love we have received from the Father.  In other words, if we cultivate our relationship with Him, we will be able to receive of His love and then we will be able to love our neighbor in the same way that we are loved by our Father.

Interestingly, He concludes this admonition by reminding His listeners that they needed to be perfect or holy, just as the Father is perfect or holy.  Of course this degree of holiness or perfection can only be obtained from the imputed righteousness available by the atoning blood of the Messiah.


&lt;u&gt;Positional Sanctification:&lt;/u&gt;

There are three aspects of sanctification.   The first aspect is positional, which is achieved once we are justified before Yahweh.  When we make a decision to follow Yeshua, He stands before Yahweh the Holy One who judges and judicially declares righteous the sinner who believes in Him.   And the justified believer then emerges from Yahweh’ eternal court room with a consciousness that Yeshua is now his substitute, and has borne his guilt, penalty and punishment and that he/she now stands without accusation before Yahweh.  The believer has the Position of being &quot;justified&quot; - just-as-if he had never sinned.  He has been made righteous on the basis of Yeshua's atonement for him which is not based on anything that he has done other than putting his trust in that work of atonement and receiving the undeserved benefit and mercy from Yahweh.  This first step of positional sanctification, therefore, becomes the possession of everyone who comes to faith in Messiah Yeshua.  
But our 'salvation' - that which we have inherited, needs to be made our possession and incorporated into our lives.
We are exhorted to  -  &quot;Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling&quot;   Philippians 2:12
As we go onwards in our pilgrim journey of being conformed to His likeness, it requires our faith in the same grace and mercy from Yahweh to appropriate the promises by faith in His son, Yeshua.  
&quot;Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see Yahweh.  &quot;   Hebrews 12:14


&lt;u&gt;Experiential Sanctification&lt;/u&gt;
Today, as well as long ago,  His people are constantly faced with the people of the surrounding nations whose amoral sexual and religious practices ran contrary to the holiness of Yahweh.   It was always Yahweh’s will that His divine presence would rest in the midst of the entire assembly of the children of Yisrael, and that they would elevate themselves to be consecrated to His calling of being a holy people.   This aspect of sanctification takes one’s lifestyle to task as it relates to becoming changed to be like Yahweh Himself.   The philosophical doctrine of men runs counterproductive to the words and instructions of life given Israel from Yahweh.   To have experientially real sanctification,  requires us to exert authority over sin by coming out of its clutches by choosing to separate ourselves from it.   This form of sanctification is actual holiness whereby we separate ourselves from all forms of idolatry, impurity of lifestyle, and immorality.   For Yahweh says that He has not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.   That means that we have to change.

We need to establish a different set of standards and life-purpose for ourselves than those in the world.    Because of that, we will often be at variance with them and unable to join in their pattern of living.   Therefore, &quot;Come out from among them and be separate says Yahweh, do not touch what is unclean, and I will receive you. I will be a Father to you, and you will be My sons and daughters, says Yahweh the Almighty'   Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the sight of God&quot;  2 Corinthians 6:17-7: 1

The world may entertain itself on a diet of impurity contrary to Yahweh’ commandments, but we refuse to sell our birthright as did Esau to gratify our fleshly desires.  The Presence of God will reside only in a holy place. The Master’s power was derived directly from the Holy Spirit; that is, the Spirit of the Holy God, which rested upon Him and moved through Him without measure.  Finally, the Master’s holiness is derived from His imitation of the Father.  Inasmuch as the commandments are the definitions of holiness, Messiah is likewise defined by the commandments because He kept them. Therefore, He was able to fulfill the commandment “You shall be holy, for I Yahweh your God am holy.” (Leviticus 19:2)  His holiness is a complete holiness. There are no holes in his holiness.  For us, sin is a hole in the holiness.  Each sin is an area of life where we have failed to uphold the standard of separation and change our orientation to the values and lifestyle of this world.


&lt;u&gt;Ultimate Sanctification:&lt;/u&gt;

&quot;For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest you be wearied and faint in your minds.   You have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin. &quot; 
To the general assembly and assembly of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to Yahweh the judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, And to Yeshua the mediator of the renewed covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks of better things than that of Abel.  &quot;     Hebrews 12:3-4; Hebrews 12:23-24
The blood of Yeshua which effected the covenant atones completely for all sin and therefore is powerful and effective to deliver us from the power of sin in all its forms.  We are given exceedingly great promises whereby we may be partakers of the divine nature and come to the perfection of walking in His divine love and truth.    2 Peter 1: 2-11

He is able to present us faultless before His Presence (Jude 24-25) if we but give the diligence to appropriate what He has purchased for us and promised to us as our inheritance.
The complete and ultimate glorification and conformity to the likeness of God will be at Messiah Yeshua’s coming to those who have been walking in conformity to His will, according to His commandments.  


&lt;u&gt;Faithfulness to Yahweh’s call to Holiness. &lt;/u&gt; 

Because Yahweh’ people are to bear His name (Yisrael), they are to be like Him and reflect His divine nature by manifesting a separate lifestyle from the ungodly customs and sins of the surrounding nations.   This manifestation of sanctification can only be expressed with a devotion to serving Yahweh in gladness and righteousness.   For if we love Yahweh then we will keep His commands and detest those things which He abhors, and love those things which He cherishes.  His commandments are not burdensome to those who love Him.

Choosing those things which please Him goes beyond &quot;not breaking the commandments.&quot;   In fact, it is taught that it is possible for someone to live a very &quot;un-holy&quot; life without really breaking any of the written commandments.  For example, if someone sat home every day and overate kosher food, they are not technically breaking a moral commandment.  However,  that is not &quot;holy&quot; behaviour - whatever is centred in self is sinful.  
Rather, &quot;holy&quot; means to take the physical aspects of life and elevate them to achieve a harmony with the spiritual aspect of divine life - to live as Yeshua would motivate you to live in this world in your circumstances of life.

In Leviticus 19:2-3 where Yahweh says, &quot;You shall be holy since I, God, Yahweh your God, am holy&quot;,  it goes on to give the instructions in the outworking of that holiness.  Every man should revere his mother and his father and you should observe my Sabbaths etc. , on through the moral and ceremonial laws  -  &quot;I am Yahweh your God&quot;.  
Why does God command us to be holy and then list dozens of commandments in order to achieve this goal?   The commandments become a blueprint to follow to achieve the desired end.   The mirror and reflection of His holiness.
What is necessary is that we become a &quot;hearer and a doer&quot; of the Word - the Torah. 
  
The New Covenant tells us that faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God. Romans 10:17
We must permeate our hearing, and thereby our lives, with the holy words of God in order to be made holy.   How can a person obey Yahweh if he does not know what He has instructed us?

To be holy is to be obedient to the concepts and precepts of Torah because Torah is the expressed will of Yahweh God in writing.  Only by practicing what is written does one become holy, and the motivation to do so must come from the heart.   With a willingness of heart there is a joyful performance of His Word rather than a dutiful compliance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This module needs to be rewritten with the usual method of doing it (ie. drawing arcs and using a protractor) rather than this overly complicated one. Also, the proofs and verifications should be left out as they are unsuitable for children.

You can't use a protractor in a construction. This is a straightforward construction based on techniques presented earlier in the book. What do you believe is unsuitable about the proof? It simply explains that the three copies of the lines are the same length as their originals and that the length of the sides of the triangle are the same as the length of the copies. I don't see the point in showing a child how to do the construction without actually explaining why it works.

      <text xml:space="preserve">American history in school often starts with Columbus discovering the American continent in 1492. This produces the impression: “The Europeans have been the explorers of America and the first civilized subjects on this new continent.” But that is not true and conveys a one-sided picture of their own country to the students.
First of all scientists estimate that the Native Americans crossed the Bering Street 20.000-50.000 years ago, so the American continent originally belongs to the Indians.
Secondly the Europeans conquered a civilized continent with highly developed societies (like the Aztec or the Inca). Language and culture were complex and comparable to their own, although they prefer the image of the peaceful settlers who brought the savages values and God.
From the independence of the USA in 1776 up to 1900 the American Indians have been driven out of their original tribal areas step by step (depending on the gradual western expansion of the USA). Between 1800 and 1850 the American population had grown from 5 million to 23 million people and they needed more space than ever before. So this required a great expansion of the young Nation and therefore a “legal” and systematic resettlement of the original inhabitants of North America. 
So this summary contains the important political events concerning the Native Americans and shall explain historical developments as a short overview. 

==Overview of the 19th century's events==
*1824	The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was founded (out of the US War Department)
*1830   Indian Removal Act: the first Indian tribes as a whole had to leave their territories. Many tribes accepted the land western the Mississippi in exchange 	for their homeland, but some refused to go which caused guerrilla wars
*1838/9 Trail of tears:  the Cherokee tribe was forced to move to Oklahoma under military control and about one fourth of the tribe members died on this walk
*1869   the transcontinental railroad was finished so that the whole North American continent was finally under European control from now
*1871   Indian tribes were no longer considered independent: any issues concerning the American Indians and conflicts about land property were now exclusively handled by the US government
*1873-74 Buffalo War: Some tribes of Plains Indians tred to save the last herds of buffalo in Texas and Oklahoma from the white hunters by force of arms because the decreasing number of buffaloes (1890 only about 550 animals left from 50 million in 1800) threatened the survival of many tribes. The will to resist the Europeans was weakened (also by epidemics of smallpox and measles that wiped out whole tribes) so the American Indians were easily forced to sign contracts in which they agreed to leave their land to the USA
*By that time almost all American Indians lived in reservations
*1874 Gold was found in the Black Hills (part of the “Great Sioux-Reservation” in South Dakota). The government planed a separation from the reservation and 	an immediate relocation of the inhabitants of this areax .This led to the Indian Wars:
*1876 Little Big Horn: a battle between Indian armed forces (under Crazy Horse and 	Sitting Bull) and the 7th US cavalry regiment (under Colonel Custer). It was the 	last and most striking military success  for the  American Indians but without 	positive effects for their situation.
*1880 Start of the Boarding School Policy in the USA: Indian children had to live in European schools which was a forced “civilization” of the American Indians
*1890-92 Ghost-dance Movement: a new religious movement which encouraged the American Indians in resisting against the government and the army. Therefore the US government tightened up the control and observation of Indian leaders
*1890 Sitting-Bull was murdered which marks the ending of the Indian wars.
*1890 Wounded Knee: massacre during which about 300 Indians were killed by the US army, among the victims there were mainly women, elders and children
*1898 Curtis Act: final step by the Congress to deprive the American Indians of self-government and sovereign control over tribes land

==Overview of the 20th / 21st Century's events==
*1924 Snyder Act: All American Indians received the US citizenship
*1941 The USA entered the 2nd Word War and young Indians serve in the US Army      
*1950 Termination Policy: There were no further supports by the US government for the reservations( e.g. education, health care) and efforts were made to dissolve the reservations and to terminate all existing treaties between the government and the American Indians.
*1956 Relocation Policy aimed to attract the American Indians to leave their reservations (e.g. assimilation programs and offers for jobs and education in 	the cities). About 35.000 American Indians moved to cities as a direct result.
*1958 Alaska became a state of the USA so that the Alaskan Natives were now US citizens as well.
*1968 The AIM (American Indian Movement) was founded to represent American Indian interests and problems; activities like:
*1969 Occupation of the island Alcatraz (estate of a former federal prison) for one and a half years.		*1969 The first Indian Survival Schools were founded by American Indian traditionalists)		
*1972 »Trail of Broken Treaties«: Occupation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington D.C as a protest to arouse the government's attention to the problems and aims of the American Indians; 
*1973 Wounded Knee “II”: members of the AIM occupied the village Wounded Knee in the Pine Ridge reservation to remind to the massacre and to criticize the US policy towards the American Indians. A forcible breakup of the 	demonstration by the police and the US Army took place. However, Wounded Knee is still a symbol for the oppression of the American Indians 
*The results of these activities were international attention and legislative effects:    
*1975 Indian Self-Determination Act: the Congress guaranteed that the tribes would be supported as much as possible (in education and other issues) and far-reaching self-determination inside the reservations which showed a turning-point in Indian policy 
*1977 International Indian Treaty Council (IITC, founded 1974) became a consultant for the UNO as a non-federal organization, so the American Indians received international acknowledgment:	
*1990 Native American Languages Act was an obligation to protect and support Indian languages.
*1990 Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act: the return of American Indian ritual objects and skeletons from museums which had been stolen from graves and holy burial places, was promised.
*1999/2000  Foundation of “Nunavut”, a sovereign Inuit nation in northern Canada

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
===Stereotypes and prejudices about the Native Americans in the USA===

It's a fact that most people don't know anything about American Indians and their current situation. The reason for this lack of knowledge probably is (besides a general tendency of our modern society to be self-centered) that most people have a fixed romanticized  image of what they call “a real Indian” which is popular and attractive and therefore not likely to be corrected:

Movies, comics and novels, e.g. the fiction of Karl May, and the childhood games have formed an idea of proud and brave warriors who live a life of privation and freedom, in deep attachment to Mother earth and nature. Their habits are savage and mysterious. Their wild appearance (tall and dark, with long plaits and dressed up in leather clothes and feathers) and the adventures on horseback are linked with them, fascinate almost everybody– a little boy as much as an adult.
However, these are stereotypes, romantic ideas of a heroic figure that has vanished a long time ago or has never existed.

Moreover this picture of a “typical Indian” which we have made up, only refers to one cultural group of the American Indians, that is the Plains Indian who is member of nomadic tribes like the Sioux, the Comanche or the Cheyenne. Also the assumption that American Indians only lived in the &quot;Wild West&quot; is completely wrong. The area in which the North American Indians had spread before the Europeans arrived, amounts to 6.1 Billion acres, an expanse which Germany would fit in more than 68 times and which contains almost any kind of climate zone and landscape. The necessary adaption to these different natural circumstances has created an immense variety of Indian cultures which can be as different in their customs as night and day, so it is impossible to talk about “the Indian” as a specific character, but rather as an individual of an ethnic group with great diversity in language, history and lifestyle.

A common mistake almost every non-Indian makes is to generalize the many different tribes and to call them all together “Indians”. It is said that the Indians prefer terms which underline that they have been the first people in North America (like “First Americans”, “Native Americans”) and that they are no exotic group but simply “people” or individuals referred to with their specific (tribal) names, like any other American. 

Another image which has come up in the recent years with conservation becoming a more and more important aspect, is the Native American as holy guard of nature who protects the animals and plants. This is a little bit bent into shape to fit in the authors' arguments.

Furthermore, the media who like to shock their audience to arouse more interest publish shots of the “modern Indians” from time to time: dull alcoholics in front of the TV who scrape a bare living in decaying reservations or guys who all run casinos.

===Who is an Indian?===
According to the Bureau of Indian Affairs (USA) one may call oneself “Indian” and receive the services offered to this ethnic minority, if one is
  
  (1)  a member of a tribe recognized by the federal government, 
  (2)  of one-half or more Indian blood of tribes indigenous to the United States; or 
  (3)  for some purposes, of one-fourth or more Indian ancestry.

However, the admission rules differ from tribe to tribe and furthermore the American Indians have mixed with people of other ethnic origin during the last centuries, which often makes it difficult to identify an unknown person as American Indian or Non-Indian.

In most of the books and articles about American Indians the author either describes their life only during the time between the arrival of the Europeans and their banishment into reservations; or he gives a one-sided description of their current situation (e.g. romanticized, shocking, etc.).

If we want to get to know the modern life of the American Indians, we should ask:

*Do the pessimistic pictures convey a realistic impression?
**What happened to the probably most popular heroes of our childhood after they had been exiled to the reservations?  
***Are they integrated or still exotic outcasts?
****Who are they? 
*****How is their life like, nowadays?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Originally the text of this wikibook had been a piece of work for the English course of a final class at a German grammar school, therefore I beg your pardon if it is not complete or in some issues wrong. I am no American Indian but I was very interested in Native Americans when I was young. So I was embarrassed about myself as I realized that I hardly know anything about the American Indians that live today, only about the period of time shortly after the arrival of the Europeans.
So when we had to find a topic for a piece of work, which had to be written in the 13th grade in our grammar school, I remembered my lack of knowledge concerning the American Indians' situation. I talked to classmates, family members and friends and found out how much (or little) they know about it. One answer was:

&quot;Oh, Indians. Are there still any?&quot;

So my decision was made. I hope you will enjoy reading and add more information, especially about Canadian First Nations, because I couldn't mention them in my piece of work (otherwise it would have had more than 100 pages) and freeware photos.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Native American Population==

For it is not easy to register American Indians and Alaska Natives without adding those of more than one race”, ( this makes up 1.6 % of the whole US population). This proves a steady increase of the American Indian population: In 1900 epidemics, starvation and wars almost had wiped out the Native Americans and only 200,000 were left. But 50 years later the number had regrown to 350,000, in 1990 it exceeded 2 million and for 2050 it is projected to be almost double the present number.

==The modern tribes and their home==

The Indigenous people belong to 500~600 federally recognized tribes in the USA, including 225 in Alaska. These are often of little membership, except the Cherokee and the Navajo nation (the most populous tribes by far) which have both more than 300,000 members.
A tribe is considered “federally recognized” if the members can prove their tribe's existence throughout the 20th century. Only then they may receive the services and benefits offered by the BIA, e.g. social services and assistance in economic development, etc.

However, there are also many tribes which are (partly) recognized by their state, but not by the BIA, for example the Wampanoag. These tribes do not get any governmental support by the BIA, so they are keen on changing their status: 150 tribes applied for federal recognition since 1978, but the Congress has signed  positive only 12 petitions by now. But no matter if their tribe is federally recognized or not, each American Indian is a US citizen today and has (in most cases) the same rights and duties as any other American.

There are 56 million acres of land held in trust for American Indians and Alaska Natives by the Secretary of the Interior which contains the federal reservations, but not all Indian reservations and 223 Alaskan village groups. The latter have no reservation status, but are often of Indian inhabitants only. As a result of the expansion of the European civilization, which forced the American Indians to withdraw farther and farther to the West, the  American Indian reservations and the areas preferred by the ones outside the reservations, are not evenly distributed over the USA. In fact most of the American Indian population is concentrated on a eleven states, most of them western the Mississippi (highest percentage among them California, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Arizona), which are the home for two thirds of the American Indians.
   	        	
===American Indians outside the reservations===
 
Despite a common assumption not all the American Indians live in reservations. Actually the American Indians living outside the reservations make up the vast majority: between 64% and 85% of the American Indians do not live in one of the reservations or Indian communities in the USA but in rural areas or in big cities.

From the beginning of the expulsion in the early 19th Century there have been a few Indian communities and single families who managed to escape the authorities' notice. But the big wave of American Indians leaving their reservations has been initiated by the supportive measurements of the US government (like special benefits)in the 1950's (Termination policy and Relocation policy). At this time, a lot of American Indians left their tribe to work in big cities ( Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York had and have especially many Indian inhabitants ) or in towns not far from the reservations ( for example Oklahoma City, Minneapolis, Seattle or Phoenix).
This happened step by step: in 1970 about 45% of the American Indians already lived outside the reservations, twenty years later it were 54%.
Nowadays the “rural exodus” is still a current topic, because young American Indians believe that the cities offer many opportunities to make money and that moving is the only possibility to change their life and to escape from the hopelessness in the reservations. 

For some this dreams became reality, for example for the Iroquois, who typically have a good head for heights and profited from their unique quality by working as demanded steel construction workers or engineers on the building sites of skyscrapers in almost any big city. Now they have settled in a quarter of their own in Brooklyn in New York City, which is quite unusual because the majority of the “City Indians” is not living in ghettos.

Different from the Iroquois many other “City Indians” have been less successful: in the beginning of the Termination policy about three quarters of the American Indians returned to their reservations and today badly paid jobs and several social underclass problems in urban areas impede the life quality of many (young) American Indians. But altogether their social situation and their career prospects are better than in the reservations which can be seen in the fact that their rates of higher education (college degree and more) are constantly higher as those in the reservations, as well as their median age and their average income. This shows a slight rise on the social ladder compared to their past.

===American Indians in Reservations=== 

Only a little bit more than one third of the American Indians are residents at a reservation (or community, rancheria, pueblo etc.), which are no longer internment camps (like some reservations in the 19th century had been). However, sometimes there are  still fences and “wards”, although the inhabitants legally are free to go and live anywhere they like. On the other hand, a reservation is no paradise for Indians: they are neither living in Tipis (, but in huts, council flats or in simple prefabricated houses), nor riding on horseback. Although they are often isolated from the modern industrial society, they adapted in many ways to the European culture, e.g. Fast-Food restaurants and supermarkets opened in the reservations and satellite TV and an Internet access are available in most cases.

Today, the reservations cover 52 million acres of the Indian trust land which appears infinitely small compared with their original tribal area, that is the entire North American continent. 
American Indian Areas (in the USA there are 270-300 federal reservations, mostly western the Mississippi, and about 21 state reservations, the majority in the East) exist in all sizes and compositions: Some of the reservations are quite small (partly less than 1000 acres, the smallest comprises only 100 acres), others are very large with the Navajo Nation in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah as the largest (containing 17 million acres); some are inhabited by only one tribe, others are the home of several different tribes. 
Many reservations are inhabited by non-Indians, too, and a lot of reservation land has White owners or tenants (actually only about 140 reservations consist of exclusively tribal-owned land). 
The US government used to handle any issues concerning the American Indians in the past. Yet since 1975( Indian Self-Determination Act) the reservations are free to form their own tribal governments, which are assembled by democratic elections or out of the elder councils. This self-government is limited only as far as the states' power, i.e. the reservations are legally treated like sovereign states and the state authorities only have scarce control over them. In many reservations laws (both criminal and civil) and law enforcement are more or less independent of the surrounding. The Navajo nation for example has replaced each law of the state of Arizona by own (except the traffic regulations) and the tribe folds its own courts and police, so that only dangerous criminals have to stand trial on a non-Indian court. 
The tribes also administer their own fire brigades and social programs and are allowed to manage the usage of their natural resources on their own (although the USA violate this right from time to time). This far-reaching self-sufficiency conveys a feeling of pride and security to some of the American Indians in the reservations and so they are keen on becoming completely self-sustaining some day. As a special privilege the American Indians in reservations do not have to pay taxes of any income or trade made upon their tribal land and they (officially) receive free health care. This supportive measures are badly needed because many are on federal welfare and social benefits.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Contemporary education and culture=
For more than 100 years the US government pursued a policy whose purpose has been to dissolve the structures of the tribal chief system and to assimilate the American Indian culture.

American Indian culture has been considered primitive, by the Westerns especially the European colonialists, in comparison to their more modern and advanced  culture. A lot of measures had been taken to make this plan real, for example missionary work to convert the “wild pagans” to Christianity, bans on ritual dance, worship and Indian clothes, and the separation of the American Indian children from their tribes as soon as possible and their education in special boarding schools. 

==Education &amp; tribal languages==
All the customs, songs and myths of the American Indians have been passed on by oral tradition ever since, so (for the Europeans) the most effective method to destroy the Native culture was to deprive them of their language:  
Throughout the 19th century a lot of boarding schools had been founded (often held by Christian organizations), in which the American Indian children were taught in English and should adopt the European and Christian manners and customs. They were separated from their tribes and families for several years without any visits. 

The reports about the teaching methods in this schools show that the daily life must have been a torture to the young American Indians. Talking in a tribal language and carrying on worship was harshly punished ( corporal and psychological punishment were considered normal), and the children generally were treated very badly: 
“He said that he got only one pair of shoes a year and was forced to wear them until they became too small, and his feet became crippled. He still [(today 55 years old -authoress)] has problems walking.”
They had to work, too, for there was often no money for servants and they also became victims of psychological and sexual abuse, and so the American Indians have gotten to know the European culture from its darkest side.

These boarding schools existed until late in the 20th century (the last ones were closed in the 1980's and 90'sx), by that time the number of American Indians who were still speaking their Native language had begun to shrink by alarming proportions: for example among the Mohawk (a tribe of the six Iroquois Nations) only about 5% spoke the tribal language, mostly people older than 70 years.

In order to preserve the American Indian languages from dying out, the wish to set up schools where young American Indians should be taught by Native Americans or specially trained teachers, rather than by Whites, and get in touch with their culture again, became stronger: 
In the late 1960's the first American Indian survival schools had been opened and an alliance of education authorities under American Indian control been established. Today almost all the American Indian reservations run schools of their own, partly they offer language courses for adults, too, and there even are American Indian colleges and universities (e.g. Fort Peck Community College in Montana or the Haskell Indian Nations University Kansas). The latter enable the young American Indians to achieve a secondary education combined with their own cultural values, and during the last 20 years the number of American Indians enrolling for college or university has increased by 80%.
 
Most American Indians in reservations visit the new Native schools from childhood and many of those who are going to attend higher education leave the reservations to earn more money, which is of advantage for their big families in the reservations.

The lessons in which the Native American children are taught in their tribal language helped to protect 175 American Indian dialects and had the effect that about one third of the children over five years talk in their mother tongue at home (although it is estimated that only the 20 most spoken languages will exist throughout the 21st century).
 
In comparison to the past, all this developments mark important steps of independence and success, especially for the rural American Indians, because formal education is the basis for future professional success and now the Native American children are able to learn without having to leave their families and give up their Indian language and identity. 

==Culture &amp; traditions==
Another idea to assimilate the American Indians to European culture was to convert the “wild pagans” to Christianity so many missionaries had come to North America funded by the US government. Since the Europeans harshly punished any kind of resistance against their “civilization” programs (the boarding schools have also been used as a threat to put the Native American parents under pressure), the most American Indians obeyed the new laws, stopped talking their original language and gave up the majority of their customs.

But during the 20th century the suppression of American Indian culture became less strict and successively the American Indians returned to their culture and explored  more modern mediums which had been unknown to them before: for example several  Native American newspapers have been published for the first time ( e.g. the magazine »Wassaja« (»smoke signal«) by the Cherokee (1916 /1926) and the “Navajo Times” (1943)).

In the 1970's a lot of American Indian radio stations had their first broadcasts, in tribal language of course, and today many of them are on air for about twelve hours a day (for example KYUK , Alaska, and KTDB, New Mexico). New media like the Internet and motion picture have been “discovered” by American Indians,too, and a lot of tribes are presenting themselves on websites today.   
When the government officially removed the prohibition of the American Indian culture in 1990 (→ see Native American Languages Act &amp; Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act) a great revival of the American Indian culture took place:  

===Sports===
 
Probably the best known American Indian sport is Lacrosse, a rough game played with sticks similar to butterfly nets, which originally took place when conflicts between tribes should be solved more or less peaceful and without armed force. It is still played by American Indians as well as Whites in sports clubs or in schools. 

===Contemporary music, literature and Art===

Music was (just like among other peoples) a very important part of the traditional American Indian festivities and rituals because the Indians believed it to be the language of the spirits. The singing has often been accompanied by rhythmical instruments like drums, rattles and sometimes flutes and this simple composition is still popular, but mainly during tribal festivals like Powwows (see page 18),  rather than in commercial music: There musicians with American Indian ancestry also deserve credit. Performers like for example Robbie Robertson (a member of “The Band”), Tori Amos and CocoRosie often use modern sounds and instruments ( for example electronic instruments in the case of CocoRosie), combined with poetic lyrics inspired by their tribal history ( as in the song “Yo George” by Tori Amos).

 I salute to you Commander ●  
 and I sneeze ● 'Cause I have Now ● an Allergy ● 
 To your policies it seems ● Where have we gone wrong America? ● Mr Lincoln we cannot seem ● to find you 
 anywhere out of the millions ● from the deserts ● To the mountains ● Over prairies ● to the shores (…)
                    ''excerpt of lyrics of &quot;Yo George&quot; from the album [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Doll_Posse American Doll posse] by Tori Amos''

In 1969 the first American Indian publishing house (“The Indian Historian Press”) has been founded and with its assistance ( but also published by other companies) books about and/or by Native Americans have been released. American Indian writers proved their well-known talent of storytelling by writing novels and essays, which are (partly) known and published outside the USA ( e.g. N. Scott Momaday's House Made of Dawn, (Pulitzer Prize for fiction, 1969)). Especially American Indian myths and fairy tales are very popular and therefore frequently edited anew. 

In the American Indians' arts and crafts there exists a manifold variety of techniques and styles which some of the American Indian tribes have perfected: the tribes in the Southwestern area are still famous for their pottery, jewelry, weaving and basketry which attracts a lot of tourists to these reservations, and the descendent's of the Plains Indians are still working in embroidery and feathers. 

But American Indians also take part in modern art such as abstract paintings and sculptures, which often deal with American Indian problems or concerns. Today Indian artwork has a special copyright label to prevent it from imitation.    

===Religion and rituals===

As already mentioned American Indians had been forced to acquire Christianity, so many of them are baptized and still believe in the Christian God. Others  are member of the so-called “Native-American-Church”, a denomination which is a kind of mixture of Christian values and Native American beliefs.

But the tribal pure religions (the Navajo for example believed in a goddess called “Changing Woman” and Plains Indians like the Algonquin or the Sioux believed in the natural power called “Manitu”/”Wakan”) have not disappeared: the myths and legends are still told and the religious dances and inter-tribal Powwows (modern dance festivals) are arranged several times a year all over the USA.

Many American Indians take part as competitive dancers, dressed in colorful extravagant regalia, others play traditional tunes and rhythms. These Powwows are a great attraction also to Whites, but they are no carnival or tourist entertainment, but a religious and cultural festivity with the purpose to strengthen the community spirit between the members of different tribes. Fortunately, the American Indians do not have to hide their culture any longer and they are free to pass on their heritage and traditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Economy and sources of income= 

The economic situation of the American Indians is quite variable and depending on the location, for example the average payment level in the reservations only lies at about 57% of the American Indian's wages in the cities. But today an American Indian can choose by right each job he likes and those who have the necessary higher education are working as doctors, teachers, judges, scientists, etc. or as social workers and policemen (especially in their own reservations).

The US Census of 2000 shows that less American Indians than white Americans work in the executive floors like in management and professional. But there are several firms and enterprises held by American Indians (about 200.000, the most of them in New York City, Los Angeles and Gallup, New Mexico), which often serve in construction work or repair and maintenance services and offer a lot of jobs for other American Indians.

American Indians without secondary education or any education at all often work as day laborers and/or move between the different farms and plantations, because in the reservations the job situation rarely offers vacancies.

The Native Americans in the reservations also make several profit out of their tribal land, for example they are allowed to rent it to industry and enterprises or private tenants, and they are free to pursue farming, stock-breeding, fishing and hunting. They also make use of their natural resources as wind power, timber and water power, but also petroleum, natural gas and uranium which is sold to the government or to companies of the energy industry. These organize the output in most cases and in return offer jobs for the American Indians (for example miners in the Navajo reservation). 

Another important source of income is tourism: the sale of arts and crafts as souvenirs, wellness hotels, ski slopes and other sports like backpacking, as well as museums and other cultural centers where sometimes reenactments of  American Indian battles or the historical daily life are presented to tourists (with the possibility to be entertained as well as to join).  

===Casinos===

Closely linked with tourism is the business of the American Indian casinos which is the best known aspect of American Indian economy nowadays. In 1988 the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, a special governmental law, opened up this source of income for the American Indians and allowed them to offer traditional Indian gaming and the lighter forms of gambling, such as bingo.

This development aid, which rescued many tribes out of their poverty (for example the Fort-Mohave, who once had been one of the poorest tribes in the USA, have built eleven casinos and luxury hotels), has caused a kind of economic miracle for the American Indians:
they own about 400 casinos and bingo centers in 130-160 reservations, the biggest resort casino in the world and the biggest casino in the whole USA is Foxwoods of the Mashantucket Pequot tribe in Connecticut. Most of the other “new buffalo&quot; are quite small but as a whole they yield about 20 Billion US-Dollars a year and offer jobs for half a million people, also non-Indians.

This great economical impact can be attributed to the fact that the USA have very strict rules concerning the gambling industry and in most states any kind of gambling is forbidden. But with the American Indian areas being quite independent from state's law and actually being no state territory, these prohibitions are not in force inside the reservations. Therefore the American Indians almost possess the total monopoly on gaming in the USA and it is not surprising that their main customers are Whites who bring a lot of money to the accounts of the reservation's casinos, hotels, gas stations and local business.

The casinos are subject of regular inspections by the National Indian Gaming Commission, which checks the observance to the official Gaming Regulations.    

===New ideas===

However, the modern sources of income such as mass tourism, the sale of natural resources and casinos are controversial among the American Indians. Some tribes (for example the Navajo, the Hopi and the Winnemem Wintu) reject and boycott the casinos, being thoroughly convinced that this business threatens their American Indian culture.
Furthermore the output of natural resources destroys or at least endangers the reservation's nature and wildlife. 

Therefore and because of fear that the success could end some day, many chiefs and heads of tribal governments are searching for other options to make money and in general many tribes  try to promote their traditional economic methods: for example some tribes are busy on re-naturalizing mustangs, wapiti, elks and buffalo as their traditional food. A new idea developed in the recent years is the operation of renewable resources and sustainable energy and sources of income which are and less dependent on grants and foreign interests. So gaming, land leasing and mass tourism are only considered as transitional economy which helps to give the actual objectives a start.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Current problems==
To get a realistic impression of an ethnic community, it is absolutely necessary to look at its seemy side and to analyze its problems. Due to the fact that the reservations in the USA are on a different level of development, their problems are varying and of different graveness. But in many cases one problem produces the next, so there is definitely no shortage of worrying aspects among the American Indians in the reservations as well as outside.
  
===Bad job conditions at the reservations, exploitation and environmental destruction===

Today there are only 52 million acres left from the original American Indian homeland of the about 6.1 billion acres that form North America and this trust land is mostly of inferior quality: the BIA took an investigation about the erosion on American Indian tribes land and considered the state of 12 million acres crucially, 17 million gravely, 24 million gently affected as to that.
So for many Native Americans there is no possibility to make a living by farming without the use of chemicals and in some reservations commercial hunting and fishing are prohibited.

Furthermore the lack of infrastructure (e.g., often no electricity, telephones or Internet connectivity) makes life difficult in the reservations and these drawbacks and the insufficient or partly missing links to the traffic system keep most foreign industry from installing sites in the reservations. The bad conditions complicate the foundation of American Indian businesses like casinos and tourism for some tribes, too, because they are not within easy reach from the next big city and the potential customers.

Considering these circumstances, it is not surprising that the rates of unemployment are between 50 and 70% (in some reservations they are higher than 80%), and that the American Indians have the lowest average income in the USA.

The government in the 1990s promised high financial and economic rewards to the tribes who would agree to the storage of toxic and radioactive waste on their reservation land for several decades. Many American Indians (mainly those of the poorer reservations like the Mescalero-Apache) were tempted by the money and were not aware of the consequences for their health, their environment and life base, which makes the barriers to the reservations' development even more unbreakable.

===Lack of education and poverty===

The percentage of citizens with less than a High School graduate was leveled 19.6%  among the total US population, about 10% higher for the American Indians outside the reservations  and again by 10% more for those in the reservations. The rate of students with more than a Bachelors' degree also proves the underdeveloped state of education among the American Indians, for it ranges between 8 and 13%, with an total USA average of 24%.

Furthermore the reservation schools have the highest rate of teacher turnover and they often lack the means for school supply and sufficient staff. Even those Native Americans students who could attend secondary education are inhibited by bureaucracy and the great distances to the universities.

This lack of formal education fuels other social problems like unemployment, poverty, teenage pregnancy, criminality and drug abuse and it forces the Native Americans to accept badly paid jobs. Therefore an improve of their life standards is not easy since they are also inhibited by the costs for food (which in reservations are absurdly enough higher than outside the reservations) and the financial burdens especially on City Indians, such as high rents and taxes (which they have to pay in full amount, unlike the Native Americans in the reservations).

As a result there are 24 to 25% of all American Indians who live below the poverty line and in the reservations the figure sometimes exceeds 40% of the residents. Especially poverty among children is an urgent problem, because for example in the Pine Ridge reservation (South Dakota) 46% of the American Indian children are considered poor, which is higher than the poverty rate among adults.

===Social challenges===
 
In the reservations but also outside the Native Americans have to deal with further worrying social developments: of all ethnic groups in the USA the American Indians have the

*highest rate of school drop outs (about 54%),
*highest rate of child mortality, 
*highest rate of suicide
*highest rate of teenage suicide ( 18.5 per 100,000),
*highest rate of teenage pregnancy,
*lowest life expectancy ( 55 years)

Drug abuse and alcoholism have become mass problems among the American Indians (in some reservations eight families out of ten have problems with alcoholism) and unfortunately among their children, too. For those the confrontation with unemployment, environmental destruction, the decay of the reservations and the lack of positive future prospects and leisure time activities to distract them situation, are probably hard to bear. 

Caused or at least promoted by drug abuse, there is a lot of crime in the reservations and outside of which the American Indians (especially children) are victims and offenders (especially young adults) at the same rate: Domestic violence, rape, child abuse and child neglect are reported to take place very often in the reservations, with the estimated number of unknown cases being very high.

Furthermore in the recent years gang violence in the reservations has increased, fueled by weak law enforcement, youth unemployment and the lack of activities for young Indians and with the results of vandalism, theft, assaults (also sexual) and street fights. 
 
====Shortage of housing and health problems====
 
Homelessness is considered a subject of no public interest in the US society and therefore there is little information about the homeless American Indians in the USA, but it is estimated that there are “90,000 homeless or under housed Indian families”, especially in the reservations where the shortage and decay of houses is an omnipresent challenge: old shacks (often left army buildings) and council flats which often lack of electricity, running or warm water and in more than 50% of all cases of public sewer and are in need for repair are common housing conditions.

As a result of the shortage of housing American Indian houses have to offer home for big families and their acquaintances, so that 30% of the American Indians live in overcrowded homes and sometimes “25 people [have] to live in a two-bedroom home” which promotes a lack of hygiene and the spread of diseases.

In fact the health conditions in the reservations are deplorable, anyhow:
Native Americans are suffering of diabetes, alcoholism, tuberculosis and other health conditions and are dying at shocking rates. The cases of asthma, heart failure, cancer and AIDS are also noticeable accumulated within American Indian communities (unfortunately mostly among the elders and children) and are out of all proportion to the inadequate health care system: Especially the malnutrition based diseases such as rickets and diabetes require expensive medical treatments like for example dialysis and therefore the federal health service in many reservations is overburdened.

Furthermore the consequences of pollution and contamination in some areas threaten the American Indian's health and life because toxic and radioactive traces are discovered in the drinking water, the soil, the nutrition and the bodies of the American Indians themselves. American Indian farm workers also get in touch with the “1.2 billion pounds of highly toxic pesticides sprayed on our food every year” because the safety measures such as protective clothing often are insufficient or missing. So an increase of cancer and deformity based deaths are caused by contacts with these dangerous substances.

A widespread epidemic of which children suffer when their mothers drank a lot of alcohol during pregnancy, are the “Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders” (FASD) and they appear in many different degrees of gravity: In general the central nervous system is affected and therefore these children suffer from epileptic attacks, speech disorders, learning difficulties, inhibited growth and deformed bodies and organs. These symptoms can be suppressed by medical treatment, although there is no complete remedy.

===Mental health=== 
  
In many books and films about American Indians we are shown the sins and crimes committed by the white Immigrants, which are often hard to believe. Hence it appears likely that the present generation of American Indians are still full of sadness and horror about the past, like the descendants of the Jews, whose fate seems almost comparable to the American Indians'.

Although we cannot look into the Native American heads, except if they write or talk about their feelings, it is known that the experiences for example of the boarding schools have caused traumas among the former pupils. The high rates of mental illness, alcoholism and suicide may also give evidence of the American Indians' mental condition.

A further aspect, which affects many poor Native Americans, is the dependency on federal welfare and the US government's generosity concerning health care and social benefits. 

===Discord between the American Indians===
  
Other Americans sometimes talk about “the American  Indians” as a compact group of tribes, which is a completely wrong impression: the Native American tribes have never been united altogether and even today they still behave detrimentally to each other. For example the crimes and abuses, such as corruption of Native American responsibilities to their fellow Indians' disadvantage, prove the discord between the single tribes and American Indians.

The US policy had encouraged this conflict throughout many decades, for they often placed the borders of a reservation in such a way that it surrounded another tribe's area. This policy has been quite effective and the Navajo, as an example, sold the mining rights for the area of Black Mesa without the agreement of the Hopi who worship the area as a spiritual center.

It would be interesting to know what would have happened, if the American Indians had stood solidly against the European immigrants...

===The relationship between the American Indians and the USA===

In the past discrimination has been the common reaction towards American Indians and was in no way inferior to the experiences of the African Americans, except that it is less known to the world. Similar to the Black Americans the civil rights activists who supported the Native Americans as well as Native Americans who stood up for their rights in public had become victims of social disadvantage or even political assassination.

Today the discrimination of American Indians is not as omnipresent and publicly expressed as in the past, probably because of the Native American resistance movement in the past century. Its traces, however, are still there: for example in the names of many US sports teams like “Cleveland Indians” or “Washington Redskins”, in commercial television or advertising using the image of the strong Indian for their purposes, or in the suggestions of some politicians to terminate the self-determination or existence of single tribes.

The ignorance and indifference towards the American Indian problems and concerns is  the more important strain on the relationship between the USA and the Native Americans, today (besides the memories to past injustice). Conflicts between the government and Native Americans are often solved by actions of the US army and other American Indian affairs are often treated without the adequate political sensitiveness as well: the decision whether an Indian tribe should be recognized as such is within the scope of duties of the BIA, a non-Indian organization with only partly Indian staff, which appears difficult to be cohered.

Furthermore the US government takes its time to realize a mistake and to apologize for it (e.g. the USA has not signed yet an official state resolution of 2004 to “offer an apology to all Native Peoples on behalf of the United States [for past] ill-conceived policies”).

The US government's obstinacy combined with the tribes' pride makes the removal of old  misunderstandings between the government and the American Indian tribes such as the erroneous belief that federal compensation payments for holy tribal land would be accepted by the Native Americans and (in return) that there would be another choice for the American Indians than coming to terms with the past. An even more important obstacle to the removal of the American Indian problems is the indifference among other people, such as fellow citizens who only have a vague understanding of the problems facing Native Americans today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==American Indian relief organizations== 

The problems mentioned and others impair the American Indians' chances of improving their living conditions and of giving more hopeful future prospects to their children and grand-children.

===From resistance groups to relief organizations===

So the outside world's attention had to be drawn to the Native American situation, which had been the basic idea for the foundation of the American Indian movement (AIM). The most important and best-known resistance group set up in 1968 and caused quite a stir with its militant activities like the occupation of the historic village Wounded Knee. Those were intended to remind the world to what has been done to the Native Americans and to make public, from which problems and discriminative prejudices the American Indians have to suffer. The aim was to improve the situation and to get through the general tribal self-determination.

On the other hand this radical group also caused a hardening of the front between the American Indians and the US government, so in the end the many Native Americans no longer approved of their aims and the AIM as a representative organization for American Indians lost its importance.

Nevertheless, the activities of the Native American resistance movement had the effects that many people in the USA and outside began to feel sympathy to the American Indians and founded charity organizations. The latter organize collection campaigns of money, food and everyday things like clothes. Unfortunately many of them concentrated on donation rather than support of local relief organizations, which is of course important for the families being in a plight. But it does not help the American Indians out of their misery in the long run, because they are kept in a relationship of dependence on the charities and do not have or are not able to take charge themselves.

===From charity to cooperative self-help=== 

Therefore it had been necessary to form partnerships between the donating administrators and the tribal chiefs and members and some organizations (e.g. the Friends of the Pine Ridge Reservation, the National Relief Charity) adapted to these challenges. They try to encourage the foundation of tribal relief organizations and to give them “a little push” by bureaucratic guidance and financial support. The effects are astounding: Innumerable tribally administered programs have been set up, on inter tribal level as well as limited to single reservations, and they replaced the federal US organizations for Native Americans.

Here some examples:

*The American Indian Science and Engineering Society ( AISES) is working on the promotion of American Indian and Alaska Native engineers and scientists and on the improvement of the access to secondary education for the American Indian student.
*The Center for American Indian Economic Development (CAIED) offers assistance in the economic and technological development to the tribes of Arizona and helps them to become self-sufficient in government and business.
*the Alliance for Native American Indian Rights (ANAIR) aims to protect the American Indian burial places and places of cultural heritage such as holy mountains like Mount Rushmore (inter-tribal)
*To guide tribes in environmental development and protection The Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals (ITEP) provides several programs like waste disposal, training for environmental protection and inspection and the running of advisory centers for questions about the climate change and other environmental issues concerning the Native Americans.
*The Indian Health Service's goal is to achieve adequate health care and sensitive medical staff for all American Indians and Alaska Natives and to improve the physical, mental, social, and spiritual health of the Natives as far as possible.
*The American Indian Prevention Coalition inc.(AIPC) tries to sub indigenous families and communities in prevention and recovery programs against drug-addiction especially among teenagers and children (in reservations and cities).  
*Held as a non-profit organization the National Indian Gaming Association (NIGA) serves as a supervision authority in gaming regulations, as office to turn to for American Indians for issues of educational, economical and legislative nature and as agent between the Native Americans and the US executives.
*The Indian Arts and Crafts Association's (IACA) efforts are targeted to the promotion, marketing and safeguard of authentic American Indian art.
*Futures for Children is an organization which manages mentoring, educational and psychological training, family support and encouraging programs for students in New Mexico and Arizona.

In correspondence with the non-Indian charity associations, the American Indian relief organizations try to help the Native Americans to stand on their own feet again without the necessity of federal welfare and give them the chance to life a live worthy for the original inhabitants of North America.

== Care section - from Wikipedia ==

Hi. Based on various talkpage discussions (at [[w:Talk:Bonsai]] and elsewhere), I've copied across all the content from [[w:Bonsai#Care]], to here. I've placed it at [[Bonsai/Care]], which is hopefully a good location. Please tell me if I've made any glaring mistakes or mis-assumptions, as there might be additional content to follow! Thanks. [[User:Quiddity|Quiddity]] ([[User talk:Quiddity|talk]]) 06:14, 1 September 2010 (UTC)

Sure, good Idea, I hadn't seen there was content around. [[User:Richardofoakshire|Richardofoakshire]] ([[User talk:Richardofoakshire|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Richardofoakshire|contribs]]) 11:51, 6 March 2011 (UTC)

==Non-traditional bonsai==
I gave non-traditional bonsai its own section to not conflict with the Japanese traditional bonsai. Its helpful to describe how Japanese style bonsai works. Since the term Bonsai has two related definitions, I could put the umbrella term under this section to include all miniature tree gardening without conflicting with the rest of the book's focus. I hope that works out. [[User:Sidelight12|Sidelight12]]''' &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Sidelight12|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:15, 17 December 2012 (UTC)</text>

Bonsai (盆栽 Japanese) (lit. tray cultivation) is the art of growing trees, or woody plants shaped as trees, in containers. Bonsai does not require genetically dwarfed trees, but rather depends on growing small trees from regular stock and seeds. Bonsai uses cultivation techniques like pruning, root reduction, potting, defoliation, and grafting to produce small trees that mimic the shape and style of mature, full-sized trees.
The purposes of bonsai are primarily contemplation (for the viewer) and the pleasant exercise of effort and ingenuity (for the grower). By contrast with other plant cultivation practices, bonsai is not intended for production of food, for medicine, or for creating yard-sized or park-sized landscapes. Instead, bonsai practice focuses on long-term cultivation and shaping of one or more small trees in a single container.
'Bonsai' is a Japanese pronunciation of the earlier Chinese term penzai (盆栽). A 'bon' is a tray-like pot typically used in bonsai culture. The word bonsai is sometimes used as an umbrella term for all miniature trees in containers or pots, but this article focuses primarily on bonsai as defined in the Japanese tradition. Similar practices in other cultures include the Chinese tradition of penjing and the miniature living landscapes of Vietnamese hòn non bộ.&lt;ref&gt;Bonsai. In Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you acquired a young tree from a garden center or nursery, or if you have collected a yamadori, you will need to accommodate your tree in pot. Placing your tree in a beautiful, shallow, especially made bonsai pot may seem tempting at first, however It is recommended you plant your tree into a training pot first. This allows the tree to get used to a life in a container and will store more water. Just after repotting, enough water is very important.
#First, cut the tip off the larger roots, this encourages new growth. Don't take too much, or your tree can dry out.
#Because you removed some roots, and with that a part of the water supply, remove some foliage too. Don't cut anything you'll regret later - just about as much as you took away at the roots.
#Make sure your pot is large enough. If there are no water holes in the bottom, cut some out.
#Cover the water holes with mesh. This prevents the soil from falling out, lets air in and water out.
#Put a bit of soil in, about two centimeters is enough.
#Now place your bonsai in.
#While carefully holding your bonsai straight, fill in soil around the roots.
#Water your bonsai.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Buying a Bonsai==
===Bonsai Store===
Buying a young bonsai and then shaping it to your desire is probably the easiest way of achieving one. Most garden stores sell bonsai, but they usually carry only a small amount, to that of bad quality. If you wish to have a larger selection, I recommend that you visit a bonsai store.
When you buy a bonsai, you should always check it for the following:
 
*     Does it look natural? (It should)
*     Are there any marks of wires on the bark? If yes, don't buy it.
*   Is the tree sturdy? Do not buy a tree that looks like a branch stuck into the soil half an hour ago.
*      Do you see surface roots? If there are none, that is not a neccesary minus, there could be beautiful roots underneath the soil.
*      If there are wires, does it seem the branches will stay in place if the wires are removed? They should.
*      Are there glued-on rocks? If yes, don't buy the tree, because it will be difficult to repot later.
 
If you are unsure of the trees’ quality, you should ask the storeowner or a worker if they can tell you its history. If they cannot, the bonsai is probably of mass production. Nevertheless, if it would be your first bonsai, it could be of use for practice.

===Buying Nursery Trees===
A cheaper alternative to buying a bonsai is buying a young tree from a nursery. You will find all sorts of trees of all ages. Buy a tree that is about as tall as you want your final result to be.

==Yamadori==

If you have decided against buying your bonsai, you might want to take out into the country and find your own tree. I advocate that you bring a few tools along. A shovel, a plastic bag, and large pruning shears always come in handy. When you are looking for a tree, look for a sturdy but not too large tree that has nice foliage. Try to find a tree with no or little fungus. Lichens, moss, and vines are okay. You can remove them later if you want to. If you see any part of the bark removed or damaged, there is a chance the tree will be infected with some disease.
Once you have found a tree you like, check if you are on someone’s’ property. If so, go ask the owner of the land for permission before you dig. If you are in a national or state park, you cannot dig there.
To start digging, estimate the size of the root ball. The roots’ span is usually two to three times the crown’s size. Then take the shovel and cut down into the soil at a reasonable distance from the tree. (You’ll be the one to clean up afterwards.) When you have your tree dug up, lift it out of the ground and place it in a bag. Be sure to leave some soil on the roots to ensure proper sturdiness of the tree.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A good bonsai is one, that looks just as if it were a real, big tree, just smaller. The idea is to symbolize and simplify the look of a natural tree.

==Stem Composition==
When your tree is ready to be shaped into a bonsai, the first thing to do is to choose a front side. This side should be the one people should look at if your bonsai is ever displayed. Then, choose what style your tree should be in. Deciduous trees are probably not as qualified for Bunjingi, Kengai, and Han-Kengai as coniferous ones, but you can experiment. Try looking at some trees in nature, try drawing them. That will give you a feel for what looks natural, for what doesn't.
If you have chosen a style that fits your tree well, (feel free to make up your own) choose a large, sturdy branch about one third up from the bottom of the stem. It should point to the right or left of the tree, never to the back or front. Reduce this branches length to 6 to 8 times the stems diameter at its thickest point. Remove all branches below this one to make the stem visible. The second branch should be pointing to the opposing side of the first one. The third one should point to the back to give your tree some depth. All other branches will follow in this manner: side, other side, back, side, other side…

{{edit filter navigation}}
The '''[[Special:AbuseFilter|Edit filter]]''' is a tool used to allow trusted users to set specific controls on user activity and create automated reactions for certain behaviors.

The [[mw:Extension:AbuseFilter|Abuse Filter extension]] was developed by [[w:User:Werdna|Werdna]] with support from the Wikimedia Foundation, and went live on the English Wikibooks in August 2010. Nearly all user-facing elements of the filter refer to it as the &quot;Edit filter&quot; as not all the edits it flags are abusive. In the software and special pages it retains its original name.

The extension allows automatic filters/heuristics to be applied to all edits. Specific rules can be developed, such as &quot;users with fewer than 500 edits are blocked from moving pages to titles which match this regular expression: /poop/&quot;. Of course, the rules can get quite a bit more complicated.

Log entries and filters are viewable by autoconfirmed users. For all filters, including those hidden from public view, a brief, general summary of what the rule targets will be available, and displayed in the log, the list of active filters, and in any error messages generated by the filter.

Implementation of AbuseFilter on Wikibooks is being done with due caution&amp;mdash;most edit filters should be tested for a few days (in &quot;log only&quot; mode) before being brought to full force (&quot;warn&quot;, &quot;disallow&quot;, or &quot;throttle&quot; modes). Only administrators are allowed to modify any of the filters. 

== Extension documentation ==
=== Filtering criteria ===
For all of the following, we can do extensive normalization, regex matching, length comparison and regular comparisons (less than, greater than, equal to) matching, combining different filters with Boolean logic.

==== User ====
* Edit count.
* Account age.
* Groups.
* Email-confirmed status.

==== Titles (moved-to, moved from included) ====
* Namespace.
* Title.
* Full text.
* Restrictions and protection status.

==== Action ====
* The action type (edit, move or createaccount).
* Edit summary.
* Contents of the edit.

==== Throttling ====
*Filters can specify whether actions done at a certain rate are by the same IP address, account, /16 range, account-creation-date, and/or to the same page, for a consequence (below) to be invoked.
* Any of the above conditions can be combined to produce a separate rate-limiter. For instance, we can group all accounts created on the same date, from the same /16, for the purposes of rate-limiting.
* Any actions set for that filter will occur if, and only if, the rate-limiter is tripped. This reduces false-positives by making the filter apply only if the same user is consistently tripping a particular filter, rather than a single false-positive.

=== Actions which can be assigned in response to filtered edits ===
If a user triggers a filter, the edit filter can apply any of the following sanctions based on the severity of the offense:
* All actions triggering a filter are logged at a special page.
* The user's action can be tagged for further review.
* The user can be warned that their actions may be unconstructive.
* The user's action may be disallowed.
* The user's account may have its autoconfirmed status removed.

The following actions are currently not available on this wiki:
* The user's account may be blocked from editing, along with all IP addresses used in the last 7 days.
* The user's account may be removed from all privileged groups (such as sysop or bot).

Note: Individual sanctions can be disabled selectively. Any administrator can [[Special:AbuseFilter/tools|restore autoconfirmed status]] in case of an error.

=== Monitoring ===
All edits triggering an action will produce a report at [[Special:AbuseLog]]. On this page, a brief log entry is entered. Users with the appropriate permissions may view the log summary. Administrators may view details on the log entry. This includes all information available to the filter when it ran, and may be useful for debugging purposes.  CheckUsers may view private data about the action which caused the log event, such as the user's IP address.  The edit can also be tested against another existing or proposed filter via an &quot;examine&quot; link.

==== Sample log entries ====
[[Image:AbuseLog-Sample.png|thumb|A sample detailed log entry]]
* 06:43, 23 June 2008: [[User:Example|Example]] ([[User talk:Example|discuss]] | [[Special:Contributions/Example|contribs]] | [[Special:Block/Example|block]]) triggered filter 1, making an edit on [[Main Page]]. Actions taken: Warn, disallow; Filter description: Test Filter (details | examine)

* 06:22, 23 June 2008: [[User:Example|Example]] ([[User talk:Example|discuss]] | [[Special:Contributions/Example|contribs]] | [[Special:Block/Example|block]]) triggered filter 1, making an edit on [[Main Page]]. Actions taken: Warn, Disallow; Filter description: Test Filter (details | examine)
* 06:22, 23 June 2008: [[User:Example|Example]] ([[User talk:Example|discuss]] | [[Special:Contributions/Example|contribs]] | [[Special:Block/Example|block]]) triggered filter 2, making an edit on [[Main Page]]. Actions taken: None; Filter description: Test Filter (details | examine)

The details link brings up a screen like that on the right.

=== Safeguards ===
To protect the wiki against poorly configured filters, a technical limit is imposed on the maximum percentage of actions that will trigger a given filter. Other technical limits are in the process of being written.

=== Notification ===
All notifications are based on the template {{[[template:edit filter warning|edit filter warning]]}}.

Standard notifications shown to a user triggering a filter '''action''':

{| class=wikitable
! Message name
! Message text
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;[[MediaWiki:abusefilter-disallowed|abusefilter-disallowed]]&lt;/tt&gt;
| {{MediaWiki:abusefilter-disallowed}}
&lt;!-- not currently enabled on en wiki
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;[[MediaWiki:abusefilter-blocked|abusefilter-blocked]]&lt;/tt&gt;
| {{MediaWiki:abusefilter-blocked}}
--&gt;
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;[[MediaWiki:abusefilter-degrouped|abusefilter-degrouped]]&lt;/tt&gt;
| {{MediaWiki:abusefilter-degrouped}}
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;[[MediaWiki:abusefilter-autopromote-blocked|abusefilter-autopromote-blocked]]&lt;/tt&gt;
| {{MediaWiki:abusefilter-autopromote-blocked}}
|}

Generic '''warning''' message is below. Administrators are advised to use custom warnings.
{| class=wikitable
! Message name
! Message text
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;[[MediaWiki:abusefilter-warning|abusefilter-warning]]&lt;/tt&gt;
| {{MediaWiki:abusefilter-warning}}
|}

Some existing filters and their warnings:

{| class=wikitable
! Filter and message
! Message text
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;
| [[Special:AbuseFilter/1|1: large deletions]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;[[MediaWiki:abusefilter-warning-removal|removal]]&lt;/tt&gt;
| {{MediaWiki:abusefilter-warning-removal}}
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;
| [[Special:AbuseFilter/3|3: link spamming]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;[[MediaWiki:abusefilter-warning-link-spam|possible link spam]]&lt;/tt&gt;
| {{MediaWiki:Abusefilter-warning-link-spam}}
|}


If a filter is set to warn and disallow, then a user clicking &quot;Save page&quot; will alternatively see that warning and standard [[MediaWiki:Abusefilter-disallowed|disallowed]] message.

==Known issues==
When the extension is initially installed, the available actions will '''not''' include blocking or removing from privileged groups. This restricted usage has been determined by community consensus, and if the extension is successful, the community may decide to enable the &lt;tt&gt;block&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;rangeblock&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;degroup&lt;/tt&gt; actions for use on this wiki.

{{warning|[[Wikibooks:Edit filter|Edit filter]]s are very powerful tools - do not underestimate the damage errors can cause. If you're new to this, make sure you get appropriate input from editors more experienced with edit filters.}}

== Creating a filter ==
This section explains how to create a filter with some preliminary testing, so you don't flood the [[Special:AbuseFilter/history|history page]].
* Read documentation  at [[mw:Extension:AbuseFilter/RulesFormat]]
* Test some expressions at [[Special:AbuseFilter/tools|debugging tools]]:
*: for example, evaluate &lt;code&gt;'some string' rlike 'myregexp'&lt;/code&gt; to test your regexp;
*: true expression evaluates to &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;, false shows nothing
* Manually test your code at [[Special:AbuseFilter/test|batch testing]] page:
*: find someone who recently made an edit that you're trying to target, 
*: put that username in &quot;Changes by user&quot; field and click &quot;test&quot; button; 
*: if you don't see positive triggers:
*:: check &quot;show changes that do not match the filter&quot; and click &quot;test&quot; again
*:: find the edit that you targeted and click on &quot;(details)&quot;
*:: check the variables and maybe return back to [[Special:AbuseFilter/tools|debugging tools]]
* [[Special:AbuseFilter/new|Create]] idle (logging only) filter
*: in the notes field add something like &quot;Testing phase, will add a warning&quot;
*: let the idle filter run for a while to test for false positives and negatives
* Post a message at [[Wikibooks talk:Edit filter]], so other administrators have a chance to fix your code or improve the warning
* Finally, fully enable your filter, e.g. add warning, prevention, tagging, etc

== Controlling efficiency ==
Because these filters are run on every single edit, a poorly worded filter has the strong potential to severely slow down editing or even cause some larger pages to time out. However, some very minor changes in how the conditions are ordered can greatly decrease the running time of the filters. Making use of the order of operations in this way can make the difference between a good filter and one that must be disabled for performance reasons.

=== Order of operations ===
Operations are generally done left-to-right, but there is an order to which they are resolved. As soon as the filter fails one of the conditions, it will stop checking the rest of them (due to [[w:short-circuit evaluation|short-circuit evaluation]]) and move on to the next filter. The evaluation order is:
# Anything surrounded by parentheses (&lt;tt&gt;(&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt;) is evaluated as a single unit.
# Turning variables/literals into their respective data. (i.e., &lt;tt&gt;article_namespace&lt;/tt&gt; to 0)
# Function calls (&lt;tt&gt;norm&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;lcase&lt;/tt&gt;, etc.)
# Unary + and - (i.e. &lt;tt&gt;-1234&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;+1234&lt;/tt&gt;)
# Keywords 
# Boolean inversion (&lt;tt&gt;!x&lt;/tt&gt;)
# Exponentiation (&lt;tt&gt;2**3 → 8&lt;/tt&gt;)
# Multiplication-related (multiplication, division, modulo)
# Comparisons. (&lt;, &gt;, ==)
# Boolean operations. (&amp;, |, ^, in)

=== Making expensive operations cheaper ===
When using keywords such as &lt;tt&gt;rlike&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;in&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;contains&lt;/tt&gt;, the filter must go through the entire string variable to look for the string you're searching for. Variables such as &lt;tt&gt;old_wikitext&lt;/tt&gt; have the tendency to be very large. Sometimes you will be able to approximate these variables by using smaller ones such as &lt;tt&gt;added_lines&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;removed_lines&lt;/tt&gt;, which the filter can process much faster. Also, using a check for &lt;tt&gt;old_size&lt;/tt&gt; can also help to ensure that you're not going to even try checking a large block of wikitext.

You should always order your filters so that the condition that will knock out the largest number of edits is first. Usually this is a user groups or a user edit count check; in general, the last condition should be the regex that is actually looking for the sort of vandalism you're targeting.

[[Category:Wikibooks edit filter|Requested]]

This page is for non-administrators or people without sufficient knowledge about the coding involved to make requests to enact edit filters. Please add a new section ''at the top'' of current requests using the following format:

&lt;pre&gt;
==Filter name==
*'''Task''': What is the filter supposed to do? To what pages and editors does it apply?
*'''Reason''': Why is the filter needed.
- ~~~~
&lt;/pre&gt;

Bear the following in mind:

* Filters are applied to ''all'' edits. Therefore, problematic changes that apply to a single page are likely not suitable for an edit filter.
* Each filter takes time to run, making editing (and to some extent other things) slightly slower. The time is only a few milliseconds per filter, but with enough filters that adds up.
* There is a limit to what filters can check for. More complex, non-essential tasks, such as those that need to perform a more in-depth check of the page or fetch information that the filter system does not have access to, are better served by separate software, run by an individual user on their own machine, or dedicated server such as the Toolserver, rather than those used to actually host Wikibooks.
* It is not called the '''abuse''' filter for a reason. Contributors are not expected to have read every policy, guideline, and style page. Trivial formatting mistakes and edits that at first glance look fine but go against some obscure style guideline or convention are not suitable candidates for an edit filter&amp;mdash;quite apart from performance concerns, if it doesn't harm the project, it is best not to hassle new contributors because of it.
* For prevention of creation of pages with certain names, [[MediaWiki:Titleblacklist]] is usually a better way to handle the problem.

== Poop vandalism ==
*'''Task''': detect &quot;Poop&quot; vandalism
*'''Reason''': A major abuse filter on enwiki. [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikijunior:Ancient_Civilizations/Norse&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1932230 I reverted an instance of poop vandalism]. I have a filter from test wikipedia you can use. '''—[[User:I-20|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;I-20&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:I-20|&lt;span style=&quot;vertical-align:super;&quot;&gt;the highway&lt;/span&gt;]]''' 20:58, 12 September 2010 (UTC)
**We do have a filter, but it needs more words. '''—[[User:I-20|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;I-20&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:I-20|&lt;span style=&quot;vertical-align:super;&quot;&gt;the highway&lt;/span&gt;]]''' 21:01, 12 September 2010 (UTC)
***The filter at test.wikipedia.org is hidden.  I'll be happy to make any additions you'd like.  Our filter is visible, so you should be able to analyze where we are lacking from your end. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 01:18, 13 September 2010 (UTC)
****I know it's hidden. I can send the filter via email. '''—[[User:I-20|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;I-20&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:I-20|&lt;span style=&quot;vertical-align:super;&quot;&gt;the highway&lt;/span&gt;]]''' 00:55, 15 September 2010 (UTC)

== Large Scale Hidden IP Vandalism ==
See the discussion at the bottom of my Talk Page.  It seems there has been some strange vandalism where large amounts of seemingly normal text have been added to pages by IP users which mostly consists of text copied from Wikipedia with some useful parts left in.  It's gone undetected mostly.  Would it be easy to set up an edit filter which warns or doesn't permit when an IP user adds more than, say, 10,000 bytes?--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:15, 18 March 2013 (UTC)

: New edits can do this. Filters cannot be applied to old edits though. I think tagging the edits as &quot;big edits&quot; should be the way to go and should be applied to everyone, not just IP users. Big edits can then be easily examined by everyone. Some registered users have copied text from Wikipedia and other websites at times too. No telling how many of those have gone undetected as well. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:28, 19 March 2013 (UTC)

::The suggestion by Dirk is that this is vandalism rather than cases of unknowledgeable editors and it seems to be only IP editors.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 07:20, 19 March 2013 (UTC)

:::A filter will find 10,000 bytes by an unknowledgeable IP editor with good intentions, an IP editor who waited until they had a lot written before submitting their work, and vandalism. I think &lt;s&gt;AGF&lt;/s&gt; assuming nothing and letting things slip through is better than assuming its all bad. Applying a tag will allow all to be found, and people to address only those situations where there is an actual problem. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:26, 19 March 2013 (UTC)

:::: The ideal, of course, is not to AGF but rather (taking a tip from Wikinews&amp;nbsp;:-) to not ABF.  But the point is well made.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 17:47, 19 March 2013 (UTC)</text>

;Description
: I was editing a wikibooks page on thin layer chromatography under the major headline of structural biochemistry. This contribution in which I was attempting to make was to include a little more information about the retardation factor between a solvent and a compound of interest in climbing up a silica based gel. This contribution also included a descriptive picture, as well as a  formula in which to actually calculate the retardation factor.

It was the &quot;retardation factor&quot; that triggered the filter due to it trying to detect vandalism with the word &quot;retard&quot; in it.  I've adjusted the filter so that it should not affect you again.  I also added the text to the page you were attempting to add.

:It was triggering because of the &quot;[]&quot; in the code, which was triggering the &quot;test edit&quot; filter, as the &quot;[]&quot; is a result of one of the buttons you see below the edit box.  Sometimes vandals will go and try to edit a page and hit a bunch of the toolbar buttons.  That filter was designed to catch that.  I removed the portion of it that would look for the &quot;[]&quot; since I see it's used often in C++ code. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 00:48, 4 November 2010 (UTC)

;Description
: This is a discussion of performance enhancements available for the Jeep Liberty.  The last sentence of the paragraph currently states that there is only one vendor of ECU flash updates for the Liberty Diesel.  Having been investigating this update for my Liberty, I am aware of at least one other vendor of ECU flash updates:  Green Diesel Engineering.  

I edited the last sentence to read as follows:
&quot;The ECU on the 2.8L CRD is made by Bosch, and at this time there are at least two companies offering a re-flash for the CRD ECU: one is [http://www.greendieselengineering.com Green Diesel Engineering] and the other is [http://www.inmotionusa.com INMOTION TUNING].&quot;

However, when I attempted to save this edited sentence, it was flagged by the automatic program as being Unconstructive. 

Note:  Regrettably, due to problems with the login program, I was unable to login with my Wikipedia username, Biscuiteater57, nor was I able to register separately under my Wikipedia username (which I prefer to do).  I received error messages that the username already exists in the unified user login, but also that the username does not exist.  I have submitted a trouble ticket about this problem.

;Description
: I was editing the page &gt; the content under the title &quot;McComiskey&quot; 
(McComiskey, Bruce. &quot;Disassembling Plato's Critique of Rhetoric in the Gorgias (447a-466a).&quot; Rhetoric Review 11 (1992): 79-90.
McComiskey concurs that Plato scholars do not contest Plato’s disdain for the sophists. However, Plato’s treatment of sophist rhetoric, particularly that of Gorgias, the Leontini rhetorician, divides scholars: some—Kathleen Freeman, Terence Irwin, and W.H. Thompson among others—read Plato’s treatment of Gorgias the sophist as fair and accurate; conversely, McComiskey, drawing his argument from extant fragments of Gorgias, sees these views as distorted and unfounded.
Plato presents this distorted view of Gorgias’ rhetoric to gain the favor of an audience leery of anti-democratic sentiments. Plato’s audience would have memories of the tyranny of the Four Hundred and of the tyranny of the Thirty freshly in mind. These bloody revolts temporary supplanted Greek democracy with a Socrates-Plato endorsed oligarchy. Gorgias the sophist supported democracy; thus, Plato’s readers were unlikely to accept Socrates’ “defeat” of Gorgias if Plato did not depict Gorgias’ rhetoric in a conflicting and absurd light.
McComiskey explains that unlike Socrates and Plato whose epistemology is foundational, based on some “external reality or immutable truth” against which to compare, to weigh impressions, Gorgias the sophist adheres to a relativistic epistemology based on the kairotic , the opportune, moment. Since human’s understanding of reality is filtered through the distortion of our senses, a kairotic moment is necessary to “unite disparate subjective” images (205). McComiskey concludes that Plato’s rendering of Gorgias’ rhetoric could never be supported by Gorgias’ the sophist’s relativistic epistemology.)

I think it was the URL spam (copy paste of a section of links I had on another page) the filter will not detect commutative edits (of the same content), I've completed the action and I doubt that a change in the filter would be required or result in improvement (even so a reviewer should be considered trustworthy enough to be excluded from this type of spam detection, or at least susceptible to engage in constructive dialog if any deviation is detected, and it would be ground to have the reviewer status removed).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 00:13, 23 September 2011 (UTC)

Your problem is caused by creating the page with a URL included as this is a common spamming behaviour.

:It does appear strange.  Seems to be some kind of prevention for new or unregistered users adding large amounts of text in one go which might suggest a copy and paste of copyrighted text.

:I believe, after looking a little more, that this filter prevents unregistered users from creating lots of new pages within a short space of time.  I have lowered the time that this filter kicks in.  The filter will now allow unregistered users to create 2 new pages every 10 minutes.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you have questions, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(This is not an automated message, I'll be watching during a time for any reply you make to it...)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 09:07, 16 August 2010 (UTC)

== Book medium ==
I've restored the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Image Portfolio]] to its previous state. The mention to use a bookmark may only make sense in special circumstances and to some users, but of more importance is that you shouldn't assume the media the book is in (there are special boxes that will prevent some information to be present on the print version). Remember not to assume the media the book is in or you will limit the portability of its content.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 09:13, 16 August 2010 (UTC)</text>

:''For the list of tags, see [[Special:Tags]].''

'''Tags''' (i.e., edit tags) are brief messages that the software automatically places next to certain edits in [[Help:Tracking changes#Page history|histories]], [[m:Help:Recent changes|recent changes]], and other special pages. The list of tags is at [[Special:Tags]]. They all come from the [[Wikibooks:Edit filter|Edit Filter]]; administrators can direct an edit filter to tag edits matching the filter.

Edits may be filtered by entering a tag in the [[Special:Contributions]] or [[Special:RecentChanges]] Tag text box.

==Use and formatting==
Tags shouldn't be overly specific, instead the log should be directly used for review of edits.

For each tag, the respective appearance and description system messages can be accessed from [[Special:Tags]]. They should be created in the usual format, using a &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Special:Tags|Tags]]:&lt;/nowiki&gt; prefix for the appearance.

Tags should generally not be renamed from the edit filter interface when they have already been applied to edits, as this would create a new tag. So make sure to use the correct name from the start, or change the tag description itself. Currently, there's no way to delete or reassign tags.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==How to change the name of your Leaf==

&lt;p&gt;As always you should back up your files before changing anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open your '''Leaf.lisp''' and use the '''Find''' function (In LispWorks this is in the Edit menu) and search for '''&quot;NAME YOUR ROBOT&quot;''' with the &quot;&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
In the line below it where it says &lt;nowiki&gt;(defconstant robot &quot;Leaf&quot;)&lt;/nowiki&gt; is where you change your robots name so go ahead and take your pick, just change &quot;Leaf&quot; to what you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Save the file, compile and close it, now open your '''Speech.xml''' and add your robots name to the end of the list of names and save the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it, next time you start up Leaf your robot should respond to its new name.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This will show you how to create a special page.

== MySpecialPage.php ==
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
&lt;?php

if (!defined(&quot;MEDIAWIKI&quot;)) {
 die(&quot;not a valid entry point!&quot;);
}

$wgExtensionCredits['specialpage'][] = array (
 'name' =&gt; 'My Special Page!',
 'author' =&gt; 'Me',
 'url' =&gt; 'http://en.wikibooks.org/',
 'description' =&gt; 'A cool special page',
 'version' =&gt; '1.2.3',
);

$wgAutoloadClasses['MySpecialPage'] = $dir . &quot;MySpecialPage_body.php&quot;;
$wgSpecialPages['MySpecialPage'] = 'MySpecialPage.php';
&lt;/source&gt;
This file registers the special page.

== MySpecialPage_body.php ==
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
&lt;?php

class MySpecialPage extends SpecialPage {
 function __construct() {
  parent::__construct();
 }

 function execute($par) {
  global $wgOut;
  mt_srand(time());
  $d = str(mt_rand(1, 10));
  $output = &quot;Hello! Your lucky number is '''$d'''!&quot;;
  $wgOut-&gt;addWikiText($output);
 }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
This is the special page itself. It should say something like Hello! &quot;Your lucky number is '''3'''&quot;!

The Ergative alignment, formally known as '''Absolutive-Ergative''' alignment, is a rather common grammatical case system. Absolutive-Ergative differentiates between the '''Agent''', it being marked in the '''Ergative''' case, from the '''Subject''', with the fusion of both seen in '''Nominative-Accusative''' systems. The '''Absolutive''' case
marks the '''Object''' and '''Subject''' the same, often leaving them unmarked.
==Distribution and Spread==
The Absolutive-Ergative system is almost absent in Indo-European languages which are by far mostly Nominative-Accusative. In Europe, the only Ergative language is Basque. Ergative languages are spread thinly throughout the world, with certain pockets that contain a high concentration of Ergative languages. While Absolutive-Ergative languages cover an area from north Canada to Tibet and Iran, one of the main concentrations are in the Caucasus languages (think Georgian), Australian ones, and Eskimo-Aleut. Other Ergative languages exist, and Tibetan is a good example.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Stock footage''', and similarly, '''archive footage''', '''library pictures''' and '''file footage''' are film or video footage that is not custom shot for use in a specific film or television program. Stock footage is of beneficial use to filmmakers as it is far cheaper than shooting new material. A single piece of stock footage is a &quot;stock shot&quot; or a &quot;library shot&quot;.

== Where can I acquire stock footage? ==
There are many ways to acquire stock footage; a partial list of websites to acquire such footage is available [http://desktopvideo.about.com/od/videoprojects/tp/stock-footage-websites.htm here].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Imagine, if you will, some monkeys.
Unlike the common stereotype of &quot;monkey see, monkey do&quot;,
these monkeys are rebellious, contrarian monkeys.
Each one always do the *opposite* of what it sees the monkey in front of it doing.
When one monkey stands up, the monkey who sees it insists on laying down.
When one monkey lays down, the monkey who sees it insists on standing up.

Now place 4 of these monkeys, one at each of the 4 corners outside a skyscraper, so each one can only see the one monkey in front of him.
When a prankster comes along and tickles the first monkey until the monkey rolls on the floor laughing (ROFL), the next monkey sees that and insists on standing tall. The following monkey diagonally opposite the laughing monkey can't see the laughing monkey through the building, but he can see the standing monkey on the corner in front of him, so he insists on laying down.
The 4th monkey sees the laying monkey and insists on standing tall.

After the pranksters leave the first monkey, that monkey sees the 4th monkey standing tall and insists on remaining laying on the floor.
We can summarize the situation as
* low High low High.

Later the pranksters find the second monkey standing tall, and tickle that monkey until the monkey rolls on the floor laughing.
After the pranksters leave and the dust settles, a similar but not identical situation occurs.
We summarize the new situation as
* High low High low.

What happens if the building has 6 sides? Or 100 sides?

Next the pranksters do something even more diabolical.
They place some of these monkeys at one of these &quot;modern&quot; architecture skyscrapers has 5 corners, and place 5 monkeys, one at each of the 5 corners.
While the pranksters are tickling the first monkey, we can summarize the situation as
* low High low High low
But as soon as the pranksters tire of it and wander off, the tickled monkey sees the monkey laying in front and insists on standing up:
* High High low High low.
Pretty soon the standing monkey that was watching the monkey be tickled notices that monkey is now standing up, so this standing monkey insists on laying down.
* High low low High low.
The process continues around the building
* High low High High low
* High low High low low
* High low High low High
* low low High low High
* low High High low High
* low High low low High
* low High low High High
* low High low High low
* High High low High low
* High low low High low
and so on.
Even though the pranksters have long gone,
the monkeys keep jumping up and laying down, over and over again, indefinitely.

The 5 monkeys in a ring around this building form a kind of ring oscillator.

There are a huge variety of other things we can use instead of monkeys.
Electronic inverters must be fed a little electronic power, but that costs far less than the feed for a bunch of monkeys.

There are conceptually 3 parts to a ring oscillator:
* signal restoration: when the input of one stage is even a little bit low, the output goes practically all the way High; when the input is even a little bit High, the output goes practically all the way low.
* time delay: when the input suddenly goes high-to-low, it takes a short (but non-zero) amount of time before the next stage &quot;notices&quot; and goes low-to-high.
* a feedback loop, so that the output of the final stage is seen by the first stage, the output of the first stage is seen by the second stage, and so on.

In practice, the &quot;time delay&quot; part may not be a separate physical part, but merely the inherent light-speed delay in information passing from one location to some other physical location.

&lt;u&gt;Requirements for Priests&lt;/u&gt;

This portion is written to define to the priests of Yahweh what the requirements are necessary for them to stay holy.  The interesting thing is that all these restrictions are outward.  First it gives us a series of regulations concerning Levitical priests: how they are to live, the kind of women they are to marry, how they are to stay away from dead things and consecrate themselves as holy unto Yahweh. The portion also gives a variety of sundry laws for the priests and how they are to conduct their day-to-day affairs. Who can be buried or married, what can’t be shaven or cut or marred.  Verse 17 through 23 speaks about the deformed, damaged or sick in the priestly line, and forbids their approach to present offerings.  Yahweh says these rules are established because the priests are leaders, and that they may not profane His name, the sanctuary or the consecration of the anointing oil.  

Its purpose is to enlighten us as sons of the Almighty God of Israel, of the great responsibility that we have been given to be the kingdom of priests and the holy nation that the Holy One Himself has chosen for the purpose of being a light unto the other nations.   From the beginning chapters of Vayikra/Leviticus,where the laws of Sacrifice (chs 1-7), to the inauguration of the sanctuary services (chs 8-10), to descriptions about how the priesthood was to function (chs 9-11), the laws of purity (chs 11-16) which include the dietary laws and the laws of purification, the prohibitions of unlawful marriages and sexual morals (chs 17-18), to the manual for moral instruction (chs 19-), the book has been developing a code of behavior that will literally set the children of Israel apart from all the other nations.  As the previous Torah portion was appropriately named Kedoshim or Holy Ones, the requirements for Israel is to be a holy nation.  Now He imparts further enlightenment and instructs Moses to speak even more instructions to the priests and the sons of Aaron. 

It also details some very important ordinances that help form the foundation of the Biblical society of Israel.   Since the nation of Israel is to become a “nation of Priests,’ with this requirement to be forever and without end,  then it is important for followers of the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob to understand the responsibility that priesthood carries.  We are in essence to be God’s representatives on earth.  It is upon our heads, because we have been given His revelation, to communicate it effectively to all the other nations so that they will to be drawn into an eternal and saving relationship with the Holy One of Israel.  Consequently, it is incumbent upon the sons of Israel to not only “talk the talk,’ but most importantly, “walk the walk. ' These expressions are useful because in this day and age, as the lines of demarcation between the children of God and the followers of the Evil One are being drawn, it is imperative that the commonwealth of Israel stand up for the Truth as embodied in the Holy Scriptures.  One of the most obvious ways we can do that is by first hearing the Word, then obeying the Word and ultimately walking it out.
  

&lt;u&gt;Leadership&lt;/u&gt;

In chapter 21 Yahweh demands higher standards of righteousness, obedience and holiness for those in leadership over his people. The higher up in leadership you desire to go the more your walk must characterize service, death to self and a holiness (See 1 Tim. 3:1-13; Tit. 1:5-9).  Standards of holiness rise as one moves closer to Yahweh.  Yeshua condemned the religious leaders of his day for not practicing what they preached (hypocrisy), for living lives of pretense and show (whited sepulchers full of bones), for greediness and pride.    The priests were given a prominent role in the service to the Temple.  With this role came many spiritual benefits that the common people did not receive.  These privileges were balanced by additional responsibility, accountability and a higher level of discipline.


&lt;u&gt;Holy Offerings&lt;/u&gt;

Leviticus  22:1-31    In this section of Torah Yahweh makes some strong delineations between that which is profane, polluted or contaminated and that which is kadosh or set-apart unto Yahweh for use in service to Him.  To come into His presence demands that men follow high and exacting standards.  This is to teach sinful man that although Yahweh is high and lifted up above the mortal and mundane plane in kadosh-ness (holiness) and righteousness,  He is not unapproachable by men who prepare themselves properly to come into His presence (Read Ecc. 5:1-2.).   He wanted to impress this upon the Israelites as they began the service of the Tabernacle.  Therefore Yahweh specifies that certain offerings brought to His altar which are contaminated will be rejected if 

(a) the offerer is in a state of physical contamination, 

(b) one is contaminated through improper marriage, 

(c) one is offering a blemished animal. 


In the Book of Hebrews we are called priests.  Yeshua is the guarantor of our priestly covenant (Heb. 7:22)  He is our High Priest, without weakness or flaw, eternal.  And under His priestly reign Paul says “Torah will be put in our minds and written in our hearts” (Heb. 8:10).   So, our calling is more than outward, (although we do have instruction in how to appear).  Our calling is deeper, it reaches the mind and the heart and calls us to honor our High Priest, to follow Him in being a servant and to move beyond outward observance of Torah to the inward life of obedience.  Not the sacrifice of animals or grains, but the sacrifice of praise, the broken and contrite heart that Yahweh can use, and the renewed mind that has wisdom from above. Thanks be to Yahweh and the Messiah Yeshua that in Luke 14 Yeshua makes clear that the deformed, the damaged and the sick will be made welcome at His feast.  We are the imperfect, made whole through His sacrifice, and we are the priests called to bring honor to His name.   

But what type offerings do we bring to Yahweh’s altar?  Our time, our money, our energy, our talents and giftings, our devotion? Do we give him the best?  Do we pray and study His Word consistently and give Him the best quality time?  Are the offerings and tithes which we give the  leftovers after other commitments are met?


&lt;u&gt;Sanctifying His Name&lt;/u&gt;

Leviticus 22:2, 32   This parasha begins and ends with Yahweh commanding His people to not desecrate His kadosh/holy name, but to sanctify or to keep it set-apart.  In Hebrew thought a name is not only one's name, but is a reflection of one's character and identity.    This is part of our worship and He requires us to not offer profane, polluted or contaminated offerings.  In Exodus 20 we find the Ten Commandments (or Words), the first word or command in the Hebrew text is prefaced by  &quot;I am Yahweh your God... &quot; then   &quot;You shall have no other gods before me...&quot;   

His character, His identity, is set before us for us to honour all that He is, to give Him the pre-eminence in all things.  Our actions and behaviour reflects on Him and affects His reputation before the world and the respect they therefore will give to Him.   If we act in a holy manner befitting children of God, His name is sanctified.   If we act in a godless or wicked manner, Yahweh’s Name and reputation is defiled.   A significant amount of ethical standards are formulated around the idea of sanctifying the Name of Yahweh.   Every choice we make in life will in someway or another reflect upon God.   Our every interaction with other human beings will in one way or another say something about the God we serve.

To sanctify God’s Name means to treat His Name with the respect, honor and consecration that He deserves.  But in the broader sense, it refers to obedience and uprightness of character.  The Torah explains that the formula for sanctifying God’s Name is obedience to the commandments. “So you shall keep My commandments, and do them; I am Yahweh.” (22:31)  The Master concurs: “Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.” (Matthew 5:16)  He is saying that when we do good works, we bring glory to our Father in Heaven. Our sins rob God of the glory that He is due.   This is part of the meaning of the words the Master taught us to pray. “Sanctified be Your Name, Your Kingdom Come, Your will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven,” are all parallel statements. When God’s will is done on earth, His commandments are being kept. His reign and rule are being exercised on Earth, and His Name is then sanctified.


&lt;u&gt;Set Apart Times.&lt;/u&gt;   

The Torah declares times (Shabbat and festivals), persons (priests and Levites), objects (e.g., articles in the Tabernacle) as kadosh or set apart.  In the Torah and in traditional Judaism times are designated set-apart (23:2) through ritual, prayer or declaration.  People are declared kadosh or set apart for service through initiation involving anointing and the laying on of hands.   In our Christian culture of extreme informality, casualness and personal independence, the kind of formalities that Torah contains when it comes to recognizing set-apart people, times and places can seem foreign, awkward and unnecessary. 

Leviticus 23:1-3   “Yahweh spoke to Moshe, saying: Speak to the Children of Yisrael and say to them: Yahweh’ s appointed festivals that you are to designate as holy convocations – these are My appointed festivals.  For six days labor may be done, and the seventh day is a day of complete rest, a holy convocation, you shall not do any work: it is a Sabbath for Yahweh in all your dwelling places.&quot;

The appointed times of Yahweh in this chapter are the weekly Sabbath/Shabbat (v.  3), Passover (v.  5), Unleavened Bread(vs.  6-8), First Fruits (vs.  9-14), Pentecost/Shavuot(vs'.  15-22), Trumpets (vs.  23-25), Day of Atonement (vs.  26-32),Tabernacles (vs. 33-43), and the Eighth Day Assembly/Shemini Atzeret (v'.  36b). 

On these appointed feasts, Yahweh calls his people together to have a special meeting with them. In these appointed feasts, He has decided to reveal his entire Messianic, prophetic program for the redemption of man and creation. 

All these feasts that Yahweh has established are prophetic pictures of what is going to happen in the future.  They are said to be &quot;holy convocations&quot;.  They are intended to be times of assembling and gathering together.  The word used for 'convocation' is mikra and means 'a rehearsal' .  Rehearsing something enables you to get it right for the main event.  Now, if these feasts are rehearsals for something greater that will be in the coming age, what will happen to those who did not want to take part in the rehearsals.

In the Apostolic Scriptures, Colossians 2:17 tells us that the substance of these times belongs to Messiah, meaning that in addition to the ancient meaning for honoring these days, which is the shadow, there is yet more fulfillment yet to come.   In Yeshua, we know these appointments mean much more than what they were originally established for.  They are a &quot;shadow of what is to come.&quot;    These verses do not say that we should not celebrate these things, but rather the opposite. They say that we should not allow anyone to judge us in the way that we keep them. The shadow is cast by the real object and these shadows help us to have a deeper understanding of the true picture which is the redemptive work of the Messiah.  Even when the true object which casts the shadow is present you cannot remove the shadow.  These shadows are still pointing to something that is to come in the future. So, when we celebrate these feasts, we rehearse and prepare for what is coming.

The weekly Shabbat heads the list of the ‘kadosh’, set apart, appointed times and is called a “set-apart convocation” (Heb. miqra, Strong’s H#4744) or assembly, calling together, convocation.  Obviously, Yahweh takes the weekly Shabbat very seriously.   Intimacy with Yahweh demands personal holiness in heart, mind and action (walking it out).  Holiness as He sees it, demands recognizing His set apart times.  This is part of His statutes which if we honour we shall be blessed. By honoring the weekly Sabbath, we not only have a complete day of physical rest, but we also rest in Messiah by devoting  the day to Him and to meditating on His Word. 

The Children of Yisrael were provided for during the forty years in the wilderness, by the double portion supply of manna for each weekly Shabbat. Yahweh knew that if men and women everywhere would recognize His Sabbath day, they would attribute creation of the universe to Him and by so acknowledging this truth would look to Him as their source of supply.  For this reason He said to them   “Speak to the Children of Yisrael saying, Verily my Sabbaths you shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that you may know that I am Yahweh that does sanctify you”     Exodus 31:13.

It is a sign that we are in covenant relationship with Yahweh and are prepared to be separated from the rest of the world.    We establish our identity by obedience in keeping His commands.

The Feast Days are arranged in chronological order and relate to one’s spiritual walk and development.  They contain the plan of salvation and/or the steps man must go through in being reconciled to our Creator God.  These Sabbath festivals were also known as High Holy Sabbaths, in which no work is done. They are observed differently from the weekly Sabbaths as they were meant to reinforce our spiritual goals and to inspire us to achieve a more committed walk of sanctification. As a result our walk of intimacy with our Heavenly Father will grow and so will our level of spiritual understanding of His ways and purposes for our lives.

At Passover we not only remember the Ancient Israelites exodus from Ancient Egypt, but we also remember the exodus that we have from bondage to sin into new life through Yeshua, Who is our blameless Passover Lamb and blood covering.  We eat matzah for eight days during Unleavened Bread not only to remember how the Israelites had to flee Egypt in haste, but also we recognize that Yeshua is the Bread of Life, leavenless or sinless.
  
At First Fruits we not only commemorate the early harvest, but we recognize that Messiah is the First Fruits risen from the dead and rejoice in the finished work of the Atonement.   This teaches us that Yeshua's resurrection is the foundation for others to be able to take part in the resurrection power, which is symbolized by the grain that comes up out of the earth, as it is written in 1 Corinthians 15:35-44

At Pentecost we are not only reminded of the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai to Moses and the 3,000 Israelites who were killed for their idolatry, but we also remember that the Holy Spirit was poured out in the Upper Room and 3,000 were saved.  In the Fall we celebrate the Feast of Trumpets or Yom Teruah, representing the holy convocation of the Israelites and the future gathering of the saints into the clouds to meet Yeshua as He returns to judge Planet Earth after the Tribulation period.  

On the Day of the Atonement we fast and afflict ourselves, as it was the day where the high priest would atone for the sin of the nation and there would be national mourning, representative of the time when Messiah will return to judge the nations at His Second Coming - a time when there will be worldwide morning as God''s wrath is poured out. 

At Tabernacles we remember our ancestors'' trek through the wilderness which represents our Father's desire to want to tabernacle or dwell with us - the primary theme of the coming Millennial reign and restored Kingdom of Israel on Earth'.  Furthermore, Tabernacles is the probable time when Yeshua was born in Bethlehem. 
And what of the weekly Sabbath?   We devote the seventh day completely unto God and it represents the coming Sabbath Millennium where Yeshua will reign supreme and all will be at rest.
 

&lt;u&gt;Love in Works and Truth&lt;/u&gt;

Love is as a verb, it is a word of action.  One who is in love actively pursues their lover.  One who is in love cherishes, holds dear, and actively desires to express their passion and devotion to their lover and do those things which please the one they love.  

&quot;Hereby we do know that we know Him, if we keep His Commandments. He that says, I know Him, and keeps not His Commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whosoever keeps His word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in Him.&quot;   I John 1:3-5

&quot;My little Children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth. And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before Him.&quot; 
&quot;And whatsoever we ask we receive of Him, because we keep His Commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.&quot;     I John 3:18-19

&quot;You worship you know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Yehudim (Jew). But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeks such to worship Him. Yahweh our God is a Spirit: and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth.&quot;   John 4:22-24

      <text xml:space="preserve">BEHAR / On the Mount
Leviticus 25:1 to 26:2;   Jeremiah 32:6-27

Behar, ‘On the Mount,’  has some very intriguing commandments in it, most  of which can only be performed in the Land of Israel.  When we review the history of the Ancient Israelites, they did not honor these commandments very well. 

This Torah portion also details various commands related to the jubilee year.   Yahweh tells us that the Land is to have a sabbatical rest every forty-nine years, with a jubilee year proclaimed on Yom Kippur.  During this jubilee year, there is to be no farming and the Land is to remain fallow.  It discusses the law of redemption and the appropriate return of property to its original owners, regulations relating to proper treatment of slaves and servants, and the redeeming of a poor man.  The parashah ends with Yahweh telling us that we will be blessed if we obey Him. 


&lt;u&gt;The Sabbath Cycles - The Shemitta&lt;/u&gt;

Leviticus 25:1-6
“And Yahweh spake unto Moshe in Mt. Sinai, saying, Speak unto the Children of Yisrael, and say unto them, When you come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a Sabbath unto Yahweh. Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof. But in the seventh year shall be a Sabbath of rest unto the land, a Sabbath for Yahweh: you shall neither sow your field, nor prune your vineyard. That which grows of its own accord of your harvest you shall not reap, neither gather the grapes of your vine undressed: for it is a year of rest unto the land. And the Sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for you, and for your servant, and for your maid, and for your hired servant, and for your stranger that sojourns with you.”

The Sabbatical/Shemitah (7-year) cycle and Jubilee (50-year ‘Yovel’) year are based on the number “seven.”  The Sabbatical/Shemitah (7 year cycle) parallels the seven days of creation and the Sabbath day.   The number seven in the bible is the number given for perfection and completion.  The number seven represents the cycle of completion in the creation.  Thus the seven cycles of seven years lead up to Yovel/Jubilee and represents the perfection of perfections - i.e. the ultimate perfection.The Stone Edition Chumash, translates 25:2(b) as follows, “When you come into the land that I give you the land shall observe a Sabbath rest for Yahweh.”    Though the rabbis say this does not imply that Yahweh rests, it acknowledges the fact that as Yahweh “rested” after His creation of the world, so too, Israel rested in the seventh year from its agricultural work on the seventh year to commemorate His act of creation (Artscroll Rashi Leviticus, p. 318). 

His instructions of not sowing or reaping in the seventh year with the promise that He would send great blessing in the year preceding it so that they would have sufficient until the next crop in the new cycle, was a test of faith and of their willingness to be obedient to His commandment and give the land its rest and enter into the cycle of rest that He had planned for them also.

The prohibition only applies to agricultural and gardening work. The only thing that is permitted is watering the plants so that they will not die. During the Shabbat Year, the produce of the ground is without owner, so anyone may eat freely and bring home as much as needed for the day.  For the poor, the seventh year of rest in the land was to provide a source of food for them.  The owners of the field were not to harvest that which grew of its own accord or to prune  or similarly to tend their vines or trees.   During this year everyone, Israelite as well as resident Gentiles, had equal rights to eat of what grew on the ground.

The Sabbath of the land teaches that our means of producing an income belongs entirely to Yahweh.  He gives us life, breath, land, health, eyesight, physical and mental abilities...everything that we need to survive.   All belongs to Yahweh and He gives us everything we need with which to work our land, do our job, raise our family, educate ourselves, etc.  We need to be constantly aware that the systems of this world are under the government of the ‘god of this world’ and are designed to draw men into captivity to the lusts of the flesh, being self-sufficient, and into a mind-set of determining their own destiny.

The Babylonian economic and political systems grip our world today and form the structure of our society.   Babylon is to be destroyed with all its merchandise.    See Revelation Chapters 18 and 19. If our hearts are bound up in the things of this world and our present cultural system, then we are still part of the system that will come under His judgement.  What He established in Israel is His pattern for the Kingdom Age.  We are to live in this world as strangers just passing through on our journey to our final destination.  We are merely sojourners and pilgrims here as was Abraham and all those who have gone before us.


&lt;u&gt;The 'Yovel' - the Jubilee&lt;/u&gt; 
   
Vayikra/Leviticus25:8-10
‘You are also to count off seven sabbaths of years for yourself, seven times seven years, so that you have the time of the sevens sabbaths of years, namely, forty-nine years.  You shall then sound a ram’s horn abroad on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the day of atonement you shall sound a horn all through your land.  You shall thus consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim a release through the land to all its inhabitants.  It shall be a Jubilee for you, and each of you shall return to his own property, and each of you shall return to his family.’     

The comparison between the Jubilee and the Sabbath is that both bear testimony to Yahweh’s creation of the universe in six days and His rest on the seventh.  They further note that the seven years of the Shemittah cycle allude to the six thousand years of history that will be climaxed by the seventh millennium, which will be a period of peace and tranquility. 	(Artscroll Stone Edition Chumash, p. 697).  

Note how everything ancient Israel did in their day-to-day life brought them into worshipful relationship with their Creator by causing them to recall both what he had done for them (past tense) and what he would do for them prophetically (future tense). We also should follow this example and forge every aspect of our life into a never-ending recognition and praise of Yahweh’s past,  present and future grace and love for us.

The Sabbaths of the land forced the Israelites to depend totally on Yahweh to bless them triple-fold on the sixth year so that they would have enough food to last on the seventh year as well as during year one again while awaiting the harvest of that year's crops.  We need to have that kind of faith to trust Yahweh implicitly for our provisions.  Think back of the ways and times He has supernaturally provided for you and your family when you thought there was no way through.

These laws concerning the land Sabbaths were a glorious opportunity to learn trust and to demonstrate their faith in Yahweh to bless them abundantly on the sixth year and see His miraculous provision, thereby strengthening their faith and receiving even more blessings from Him the next time, which resulted in them coming progressively to even higher levels of faith.

The Rabbis generally understood this word Yovel, to mean the 'ram's horn'.  However it also carries the meaning of &quot;set out&quot; and &quot;freedom of movement&quot;.  It is also synonymous with a river to which the roots of a tree planted by the river's edge will grow.   &quot;This gives it the sense of a return to roots, meaning thereby that all the fields return to their original owners and each generation goes back to it's original status.&quot;  (Munk Op. cit. 301)

The Yovel or the Jubilee Year was not only for the land, but for its people Yisrael.  If the Children of Yisrael today as well as then would have allowed Yahweh’ divine providence to influence their lives, the corruption of society through murder, thievery, and every imaginable scandal could have been averted.  The land is a divine gift from Yahweh.  For everything is His; the earth belongs to Yahweh and the people that dwell therein for He has founded them both.

The ownership of the land reverts to its original owners during Yovel.  To attempt to sell the land permanently is a violation of this commandment, and particularly to a non-Israelite who does not observe these commandments.

Prophetically, this symbolises the year of release from all bondage, all captivity and enslavement, when everything in creation goes back to it's original condition of purity and righteousness.    For this the whole creation travails and groans to be released from its burden of corruption that resulted from the defilement of sin.  Romans 8:22

Torah mentions in this parasha that the shofar should be blown on the tenth day of the seventh month which is Yom Kippur/Day of Atonement to announce the year of Yovel. Then it says that the year ought to be consecrated and proclaimed as a year of liberty.This blast of the shofar was called the shofar hagadol/the great or final shofar blast (to be distinguished from the first and second shofar blasts which occurred on the feasts of Shavuot/Pentecost and Yom Teruah/Feast of Trumpets respectively.  This same event prophetically corresponds with the return of the exiles (the &quot;lost ten tribes&quot;) to the land of Israel (which is an aspect of what the rabbis call the &quot;Final Redemption&quot;) and the return of Yeshua the Messiah. 

Messiah will come back to place his feet on the earth on Yom Kippur. When he comes back, new liberty will be proclaimed to all the inhabitants of the earth. This also teaches us that the foundation we have for eternal liberty is in the Messiah's death, which is symbolized by the Yom Kippur sacrifices, as well as in the forgiveness and obliteration of sins as a direct result of his death.


&lt;u&gt;Walking As Pilgrims and Sojourners in the Land&lt;/u&gt;

As we approach the end of the book of sanctity of Vayikra, we find that the Torah turns to the subject of fair and just relations between man and man.  We are taught to effect justice in commerce, not to lend money with interest, not to maltreat a fellow believer who has sold himself into slavery, and to redeem a field that had been sold due to dire poverty. A lthough the book of Leviticus/Vayikra treats matters of great holiness, the Torah wishes to communicate that the proof of holiness is demonstrated when morality prevails over self-interest in financial matters.  Along these lines, the Torah prohibits wronging one another (ona’ah):   And if you sell anything to your fellow or buy anything from your fellow’s hand, you shall not wrong (AL TONU) one another (Leviticus/Vayikra 25:14)

This means that, whether there is a transaction of land or movable property, both the buyer and seller are prohibited from defrauding or overcharging.  A profit of up to one-sixth is permissible; with movable property, if the profit is more than one-sixth the sale can be nullified, and if it is exactly one sixth, the profit is returned and the sale remains valid.  Even with landed property, there is a prohibition against ona’ah, although the sale is still valid.

In verse 17 the text says &quot;you shall not oppress one another&quot;.   This means to 'treat abusively' and prohibits wronging another by means of words, not to vex his fellow, nor to offer him inappropriate advice, according to the way and the pleasure of the advisor. In other words, not for personal gain.
The Rabbis understand that the Torah here is teaching against any form of maltreatment, even when no monetary gain is involved, such as verbal abuse or misleading someone.   In any case both applications of ona’ah have one thing in common: pressing one’s advantage to the detriment of another.

The fear of Yahweh is what prevents people from wronging one another.  First of all, one who fears God knows that every person is created in His image to be like Him. Therefore he ought to be respected, regardless of his lifestyle. Just because he is a person, he ought to be respected. Deceiving anyone financially or tormenting anyone verbally is not permitted.  One who deceive and oppresses his fellow man is hurting Yahweh.  Therefore, fear of God will cause people to treat others with respect and love.

When His people live in the light of the knowledge that they are but passing through this life and all that they have and use upon this earth is but leased to them, they do not claim ownership of goods and property.  In this mindset, all are but passing through this life on a pilgrim journey, partaking of the generosity of the true Owner of all things.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Bechukotai 	The Gospel in Leviticus
Vayikra (Leviticus) 26:3-27:34 | Yirmeyahu (Jeremiah) 16:19-17:14

This week’s Torah teaching introduces one of the central aspects of the covenant made through Moshe of obedience to His statutes. The Torah clearly teaches here in this parashah that blessing is predicated upon obedience to its chukkim (laws). 

The word chuk (“statute” or “decree”), which gives the Parshah of Bechukotai its name, literally means “engraved”.
The Torah comes in two forms: written and engraved.   On the last day of his life, Moses inscribed the Torah on parchment scrolls.  But this written Torah was preceded by an engraved Torah: the Divine law was first given to us encapsulated in the Ten Commandments, which were etched by the hand of God in two tablets of stone.
By the Holy Spirit - the Ruach ha Chodesh we now have the Torah engraved in our being as well as having the written Word.

Because the Torah is written on the hearts of all who truly name the name of Yeshua as Lord and Savior, it is meant to be followed to the best of our ability.   We have no reason for fear of condemnation, or the trappings of legalism!	(Deuteronomy 10:12-22; Jeremiah 31:33; Ezekiel 36:25-27; Romans 7:22; 8:1; Hebrews 8:10)

We enter into the blessing of His life through faith, but we maintain His life within through not grieving His Spirit, that is, by keeping His precepts.  Thus we maintain fellowship with Him and do not allow ourselves to become separated from Him by disobedience.

Covenants require a response on the part of the follower. Yahweh, for His part, has provided the “promise of inheritance” for all those who participate in the Abrahamic Covenant.  The response to this covenant is “faith”.  The nature of the Mosaic Covenant is “blessing, maintenance, and enjoyment of promise” on the basis of “obedience”. 
 

&lt;u&gt;If you walk in My statutes&lt;/u&gt; (Leviticus 26:3)

If you will walk in My statutes and keep My commandments and perform them; then I will provide your rains in their time, and the land will give its produce and the tree of the field will give its fruit.  Your threshing will last until the vintage, and the vintage will last until the sowing; you will eat your bread to satiety and you will dwell securely in your land.  I will provide peace in the land, and you will lie down with none to frighten you: I will cause wild beasts to withdraw from the land, and a sword will not cross your land.  You will pursue your enemies; and they will fall before you by the sword.  Five of you will pursue a hundred, and a hundred of you will pursue ten thousand; and your enemies will fall before you by the sword. I will turn My attention to you, I will make you fruitful and increase you; and I will establish My covenant with you.  You will eat very old grain and remove the old to make way for the new.  I will place My Sanctuary among you; and My Spirit will not reject you.  I will walk among you, I will be God unto you and you will be a people unto Me.

The word &quot;if&quot; is understood as a plea on the part of God: &quot;If only you would follow My statutes.. .. &quot;(Talmud, Avodah Zarah 5a)

As a loving Father Who desires our good, His heart longs that we might choose to do what is right that He might not have to chastise us to bring us into the path of life.   He would  rather shower us with blessings than use corrective punishment upon us. These punishments here are temporal and meant to be corrective.   When a child trespasses and breaks the family covenant, he is not excluded from the family, but disciplined with the intent that he will learn and grow from the experience. So it is with our heavenly Father - His love is unconditional but not without corrective chastisement.  It is meant to correct us.

In verse 23 Yahweh warns them about behaving 'casually' with Him - an attitude of familiarity that breeds contempt for His instructions.    In the Targum Onkelos the word is interpreted with the meaning of 'witholding' - that is withholding obedience from a heart that is hardened.   This speaks of wilful disobedience and disregard for His instructions to us - going one's own way.
It is the attitude expressed by the actions rather than the behaviour itself.


&lt;u&gt;The Curse of the Law&lt;/u&gt;

From a New Covenant perspective, some teach that all of the curses of the law have been removed in Messiah.  It is a common teaching, based on Galatians that, “Messiah redeemed us from the curse of the Torah.” (Galatians 3:13). This seems to indicate that in Messiah, the curses are removed, but the blessings remain   --  ?
“The curse of the law” spoken of in Galatians 3:13 is not the curses for disobedience listed out in Leviticus 26 or Deuteronomy 28.  The “curse of the law” in Galatians is the end result of the spiritual condition of being separated from God which is death  -  the judgement upon man’s sinful state which is eternal separation from God.   This is different from the curses which come from acts of disobedience of a redeemed community or a person who are in covenant relationship with Yahweh. 

According to Paul, “The curse of the Torah/Law” is condemnation in the eternal court of judgment.   This is the curse of condemnation and death that was unleashed upon Messiah on the torture stake when He took the penalty of sin upon Himself so that all who accepted His atonement would be delivered from its consequences.  It is this condemnation from which we have been redeemed and which has been nailed to His cross.     (Colossians 2:14)
The “certificate of debt” which has been taken out of the way and nailed to the cross is the judgement of eternal death.   This is the ultimate curse of the Torah/Law.   It is this curse which Messiah took upon Himself in becoming “a curse for us.” (Gal. 3:13)

Therefore it is incorrect to suppose that there are no longer any consequences for sin.   The ultimate consequence of condemnation has been removed — nailed to the cross.  But the laws of cause and effect are still very much at work.  Sin still reaps punishment.  Obedience to God still results in blessing.   (Romans 4:15, 5:18–20, 7:25–8:1, 1 Corinthians 3:9)


&lt;u&gt;Blessing and the Curse&lt;/u&gt;

It is interesting that the rewards for keeping His commandments are returned in the physical realm of life to give us abundance in the things which we need for livelihood.   Whereas the absence of His blessings cause us to labour under the heaviness of our existence when things don’t go well for us, with the intent that it will be corrective and that we will turn our hearts toward Him again seeking His deliverance from the result of our errant ways.
The blessings of obedience are an encouragement to continue in the bond of the covenant in relationship with Him and the curses which we reap from eating the fruit of our own ways are meant to keep us from going on unchecked in our rebellious lifestyle.   

After the blessings comes the “rebuke” or “punishment”  --a harshly detailed prediction of what will befall the people of Israel when they turn away from God.   His reproof to them, found in chapter 26:14-45, is in Hebrew the “Tochacha”, a “minor” listing of “curses” brought against the People for their disobedience.  A similar yet “major” listing, also referred to as “Tochacha”, can be read in Parashat Ki Tavo at D’varim (Deuteronomy) chapter 28.

The Hebrew word tochacha means reproof, correction, scolding, reprimand, punishment, etc.  By its context it conveys the purpose of “divine retribution”.   Interesting by comparison, the Hebrew of this current chapter is written in the plural, addressing collective Isra’el.  Its counterpart in Dvarim 28, however, is written in the singular.

There are three things which are listed here specifically as a mandate for the blessings to follow and they are - 
“You shall not make idols for yourselves .. .. .. “
“You shall keep My Sabbaths and reverence My Sanctuary .. .. .. “

These are the priorities of worship - of loving Him with all our mind, heart, soul and strength   -  which if we do,  He says,
# “I will give you the rain in its season  “   ..  
# the land shall yield its produce, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.
# Your threshing shall last till the time of vintage ..  ..   (no shortage of supply)
# you shall eat your bread to the full ..  ..   ..   (full satisfaction and nourishment from what you eat)
# and dwell in your land safely.  I will give peace in the land.”
# I will rid the land of evil beasts, and the sword will not go through your land.”  (3-13)
# He gives promises of power over our enemies, to overcome them  (v.7-8)  And most importantly,  
# “I will look on You favourably and make you fruitful, multiply you and confirm My covenant with you&quot;

Yahweh says that He will ‘confirm’ or ‘maintain’ the covenant, or more correctly translated, “I will cause My covenant to stand”.    In other words He will cause the promises of the covenant  to stand.   
“I will set My Tabernacle among you,    ..   ..  ..   I will walk among you and be your God, and you shall be My people.” (v.11-12)

His literal Presence with them was part of His covenant with them at Sinai.   
He said, “My Presence will go with you” into the land (Exodus 33:14),  and in the land His Tabernacle was set up as  a permanent dwelling place among them.    So it continued with them while they kept His covenant.


&lt;u&gt;The Basis of the Blessings and the Curses&lt;/u&gt;

Before commencing the blessings, Yahweh states: “If you walk in My statutes, and keep My commandments and do them .. .. “  The blessings were conditional.  (26:3 )
Before the curses the He states:   “But if you will not hearken to Me, and will not do all these commands .. .. “ 26:14
“And if you shall despise, or if your soul abhor My judgments, so that you will not do all My commandments, but that you break My Covenant.” 26:15   The standards applied to the blessings evidently differ from those relating to the curses.
Thus, the curses are not to be administered upon the mere transgression of the laws (space is given to repent); only upon despising and abhorring them, as noted by Seforno:   If you shall despise My statutes  beyond mere violation, you will despise them;
And if your soul loathe My judgments consciously  i.e., loathe them as one might willfully spew out something that is objectionable.”     

Thus the preconditions of the blessings radically differ from those of the curses. The understanding is that it is the rejecting of His commandments that brings the curse, not the failure to keep them by one whose heart is toward Him and who fails through the weakness of the flesh.

These statutes are defined for the corporate body of Israel (all twelve tribes including those who join themselves to greater Israel) from its founder, the author and finisher of our faith, Yahweh.  These statutes stand as eternal decrees, permanent rules, which were not annulled at Calvary.  These statutes are also considered (the laws) or instructions enacted by our legislative branch of divine government through Yahweh.  Throughout the discourse of this study, we see that blessings are given to those who observe His statutes in obedience, but to those who are given to disobedience, we see punishment.  Even in the natural, there is a consequence to disobeying the laws and instructions which govern a unified community of people formed into an association such as a society or nation. 

Yahweh assures us that if we obey His statutes, we will be so busy with prosperity that we will still be busy threshing grain when the time comes to harvest our grapes and even then we will still be occupied when it comes time to sow the next year.  Even the very old grain, the stored crops from previous years, will remain fresh and even improve with age so that the old grain will be superior to the new.  And when the new crops come in, new storage houses will need to be built to make room for the new crop. These passages of scripture are rich with the fullness of being close to Yahweh’ heart, however, it does come at a price to us.  The cost for Yahweh’ favored hand of blessings will require us to be obedient and faithful to His statutes.  However, if we choose our way above His, we will face a series of punishments.

:The first series of punishments:

But if you will not listen to Me and will not perform all of these commandments; if you consider My decrees loathsome, and if your being rejects My ordinances, so as not to perform all My commandments, so that you annul My covenant – then I will do the same to you; I will assign upon you panic, swelling lesions, and burning fever, which cause eyes to long and souls to suffer; you will sow your seeds in vain, for your enemies will eat it.  I will turn My attention against you, you will be struck down before enemies; those who hate you will subjugate you – you will flee with no one pursuing you.

:The second series of punishments:

If despite this you do not heed Me, then I shall punish you further, seven times more for your sins.  I will break the pride of your might; I will make your heaven like iron and your land like copper.  Your strength will be spent in vain; your land will not give its produce and the tree of the land will not give its fruit.

:The third series of punishments:

If you behave casually with Me and refuse to heed Me, then I shall lay a further blow upon you – seven times like your sins.  I will incite the wildlife of the field against you and it will leave you bereft of your children, decimate your livestock, and diminish you; and your roads will become desolate.

:The fourth series of punishments:

If despite these you will not be chastised toward Me, and you behave casually with Me, then I, too, will behave toward you with casualness; and I will strike you, even I, seven times for your sins.  I will bring upon you a sword, avenging the vengeance of a covenant, you will be gathered into your cities; then I will send a pestilence among you and you will be delivered into the hand of your enemy.  When I break for you the staff of bread, ten women will bake your bread in one oven, and they will bring back your bread by weight; you will eat and not be sated. 

:The fifth series of punishments:

If despite this you will not heed Me, and you behave toward Me with casualness, I will behave toward you with a fury of casualness; I will chastise you, even I, seven times for your sins.  You will eat the flesh of your sons; and the flesh of your daughters will you eat.  I will destroy your lofty buildings and decimate your sun-idols, I will cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols, and My Spirit will reject you.  I will lay your cities in ruin and I will make your sanctuaries desolate; I will not savor your satisfying aromas.  I will make the land desolate; and your foes who dwell upon it will be desolate. And you, I will scatter among the nations, I will unsheathe the sword after you, your land will be desolate and your cities will be a ruin.

There is an increasing severity in the punishments meted out, but this is not vengeance in operation but a greater measure of discipline required by the stiff-neckedness of the rebellious and their failure to repent in the previous lighter measures of judgement which required Him to exert greater pressure upon them.

Because of Israel’s disobedience and failure to observe the commandment of keeping the Sabbatical years, they were exiled from the land into Babylon for seventy years.  During that time, the land made up for the rest in which it had been deprived.  Israelities, Judah and Ephraim, have been scattered throughout the nations of the world, and were cut off from one another.


&lt;u&gt;Faith and Obedience to Yahweh&lt;/u&gt;

The keeping of Yahweh’s principles does not cause one to inherit eternal life - you cannot earn spiritual blessings.  It is only by faith that you enter into His life (which is an eternal spiritual quality of life) and not by any works of righteousness that you do - you cannot earn salvation.
But as a result of inheriting His life and becoming a recipient of it, Yahweh’s expectation is that you will walk in His precepts.

If we are to ever experience the heights and depths of a real relationship with Yahweh, it will require not only our faith but that of works.  Faith without works is dead.  If we say we love Yahweh and keep not His commandments, then we are a lie and the truth is not in us.  For love is a word of action and requires work to show forth your affection and love.  If we are in love with someone, it requires faithfulness to that person.  So then did our faith in Yeshua at Calvary annul the commandments of Yahweh?  May it never be!  What our faith in fact does is establish a unique and personal relationship with our Messiah Yeshua and Yahweh. Our faith in Yeshua does not lessen our commitment to Yahweh’ instructions and statutes, but in effect establishes and brings about a synthesis of love and obedience to His statutes, and a desire to never wander far from His divine presence ever again.  

Because the Messiah has already come, the Torah is now a document meant to be lived out in the life of a faithful follower of Yeshua, through the power of the Ruach HaKodesh, to the glory of the Father.  It should not be presumed that it can be obeyed in one’s own strength, automatically or legalistically, without having the faith and trust in the empowering of His life within.  Nor can it be performed mechanically without having a motivation of love for Yahweh and for others.  Torah observance is a matter of the heart, always has been, and always will be.

This idea of commandment-keeping is a state of mind, as well as a daily function!  We should never fall for the age-old, compulsory reasons for keeping the commands of Yahweh for being accepted by Him! 

It is not something we do to become saved; it is something we do because we are saved!    It is the result from having the Torah placed in our inward parts, as new creations in Messiah Yeshua,  giving us a new nature that desires to obey Him!

      <comment>moved [[User talk:I-20/rollback.js]] to [[User talk:Frozen Wind/rollback.js]]: Automatically moved page while renaming the user &quot;[[User:I-20|I-20]]&quot; to &quot;[[User:Frozen Wind|Frozen Wind]]&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">;Usage

To install [[User:I-20/rollback.js]], add the following to [[Special:Mypage/monobook.js]] as a logged-in user using the monobook skin:
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
importScript('User:I-20/rollback.js');
&lt;/source&gt;

On diff pages, history pages, user contribution pages, recent changes, and personal watchlists, a &quot;sum&quot; link will appear next to the &quot;rollback&quot; link. When you click on &quot;sum&quot;, you will be prompted to enter a summary. Press Cancel to cancel, or leave a blank summary to use the default. In the summary, the text &quot;$user&quot; will automatically be replaced with the user name you're reverting. e.g., &quot;&lt;tt&gt;rv edits by $user; not true&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. Then press OK to submit.

;Extra options

To disable the link from appearing on any one of the pages, add a line containing a list after the &quot;importScript&quot; statement. The options are 'diff', 'history', 'user', 'recent', and 'watchlist'. For example, to disable the link on history pages and user contribution pages:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
rollbackLinksDisable = [ 'history', 'user' ]
&lt;/source&gt;

In addition, there is an option to have default text in the summary pop-up instead of a blank text field. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
rollbackSummaryDefault = &quot;[[WP:RBK|Reverted]] edits by [[Special:Contributions/$2|$2]] ([[User talk:$2|talk]]) to last version by $1&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

;Finally
None of the above affects how rollback is done if you use the 'rollback' link instead of the 'sum' link. Please contact if there are any problems :) [[User:Gracenotes|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#960;&quot;&gt;Grace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000;&quot;&gt;notes&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Gracenotes|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#960;&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;span title=&quot;User talk:Gracenotes/rollback.js&quot;&gt;§&lt;/span&gt;

Contents

Introduction

Model gliders made out of paper and rubber powered planes fascinating toys. This book will describe how to build and fly these. 


'''Part 1: Gliders from Paper'''

The first step is to build a simple paper glider such as the one shown. Cut the tabs at the back of the wing as shown in the diagram. These will be used to trim the paper plane, that is to adjust the wings so that the plane will fly level.

Why won't the paper plane fly straight without any adjustments? Just like its real life counterparts, the model plane may have inaccuracies in its construction- we call this the air frame, and will need to be trimmed, that is, adjusted in flight to make it fly correctly. For most single engined propeller planes, however, adjustments need to be made to counteract the effect of the slipstream from the propeller, different forces being felt at different speeds and power settings, as well as adjusting the plane so that it does not climb or dive. 

Launch the paper plane holding it level. In the case of my paper plane...

      <text xml:space="preserve">1. Which of the following definitions are functions and which are relations:

:a. &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x + 2&lt;/math&gt; = '''Function'''
:b. &lt;math&gt;g(x) = x - 2&lt;/math&gt; = '''Function'''
:c. &lt;math&gt;h(x) = x * 2&lt;/math&gt; = '''Function'''
:d. &lt;math&gt;i(x) = x / 2&lt;/math&gt; = '''Function'''

2. Which of the following definitions are functions and which are relations:

:a. &lt;math&gt;j(x) = x + x&lt;/math&gt; = '''Function''' Same as x * 2.
:b. &lt;math&gt;k(x) = x - x&lt;/math&gt; = '''Relation'''
:c. &lt;math&gt;l(x) = x * x&lt;/math&gt; = '''Relation'''
:d. &lt;math&gt;m(x) = x / x&lt;/math&gt; = '''Relation'''

3. Can you write descriptions of the functions in problems 1 and 2? What is the difference?

The functions in exercise 1 use a variable and a constant.  The function and relationships in exercise 2 depend on the value of the variable x.  In exercise 1 the functions are guaranteed to be unique because x is changed in a consistent way.  In question 2 the last three functions are relations because the function value can re-occur.  K(x) is a relation because for any value of x the answer will always be 0, l(x) is a relation because it has the the same values for positive and negative values of x, and m(x) has two values: either 1 or -1 and is undefined at 0.  When we evaluate the relationships of the variables in terms of themselves we begin to explore the functionality of the operators.  &lt;math&gt;x + x&lt;/math&gt; shows the relationship between addition and multiplication.  &lt;math&gt; x * x&lt;/math&gt; shows a similar relationship between multiplication and exponentiation.  (Is &lt;math&gt;n(x) = x * x * x &lt;/math&gt; a function or a relation?)   &lt;math&gt;x - x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x / x&lt;/math&gt; show the identity property of subtraction and division respectively.  (What are the identity properties of addition and multiplication?  Are these functions or relationships?)

&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:20.0pt'&gt;Basic Irony Tutorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 

 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;In this tutorial I will be going through the steps to
create a basic language called “GridWorld” Syntax. Keep
in mind: First, this tutorial was not intended to provide exhaustive knowledge
of the Irony tool, and second, that use of the sample projects in the Irony
download is strongly recommended. &lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'&gt;&lt;span 
style='font-size:20.0pt'&gt;Chapter 1 -- GridWorld&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:16.0pt'&gt;I. Introduction to GridWorld&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;We will start off by creating a simple language that
describes a grid of certain height and width, starts at some location within
the grid, and move around within the grid. So here is some possible source code
for the GridWorld language:&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Create a 10 by 10 grid.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Start at location 1,1.&lt;span style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;(1)&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Move down 3.&lt;span style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;(2)&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Move right 4. &lt;span style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;(3)&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Move up 1.&lt;span style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;(4)&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;And here is the result, assuming (0,0) is of the form
(row, column) and is the top left most square:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;You might have already reasoned that it wouldn’t be too
difficult to tackle this problem without use of any parsing tool at all. The
first two lines of our language will always be the same in every program that
we make, with different numbers in place of “10 by 10” and “1,1”, and the next
few lines are quite repetitive. Perhaps the program would become more complex
if the coder was assigned to &lt;i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'&gt;validate the
syntax&lt;/i&gt; of this toy language. Even still, in this case it would be a
relatively easy task. &lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;However, consider writing the same program for a much
more complex language such as Python or C#--a primitive approach from scratch,
though not impossible, would take a lot of time. Irony offers a robust method
to parse language structure. This GridWorld toy problem is a simple basis on
which to learn how to tackle much more complex grammars in the future.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:16.0pt'&gt;II. Creating a GridWorld Grammar
class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;The first step in attacking this problem with Irony is to
create a Grammar class. This class will act like a generalizing schema to parse
source code. First, we’ll need to get the Irony library.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l3 level1 lfo3'&gt;&lt;span 
style='mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri'&gt;&lt;span style='mso-list:Ignore'&gt;1.&lt;span 
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Download
Irony. Go to http://irony.codeplex.com/ and get the latest version. &lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l3 level1 lfo3'&gt;&lt;span 
style='mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri'&gt;&lt;span style='mso-list:Ignore'&gt;2.&lt;span 
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Open
the main project and build it in Visual Studio. &lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l3 level1 lfo3'&gt;&lt;span 
style='mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri'&gt;&lt;span style='mso-list:Ignore'&gt;3.&lt;span 
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This
should generate Irony.dll in “irony-XXXX/Irony/bin/Debug”&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:.5in'&gt;Add Irony.dll to your project.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Now, create a class that extends Irony.Grammar&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:blue;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;using&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-no-proof:yes'&gt; &lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;Irony&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:
red'&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;Parsing&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;span style='color:blue'&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:blue;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:blue;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span

style='color:navy'&gt;GridWorldGrammar&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span style='color:navy'&gt;Grammar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:.5in'&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:blue;
mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt; &lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;GridWorldGrammar&lt;/span&gt;()
{}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;One option we have at this point is to use case
sensitivity. The Grammar class has a constructor that takes a bool to define
this characteristic, so we could have used the following to support phrases
such as “moVE RigHT 1” (by default, the grammar &lt;b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; case sensitive):&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:.5in'&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:blue;
mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt; &lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;GridWorldGrammar&lt;/span&gt;()
: &lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;base&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;)
{}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;In this class, we define the rules of the GridWorld
language in BNF. Our language structure has 3 parts to it: the create
statement, the start statement, and one or more move statements. We’ll call the
entity that contains all three of these parts the &lt;b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'&gt;&lt;i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'&gt;program&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The &lt;b 
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'&gt;&lt;i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'&gt;createStatment
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;is defined with the words “Create” and “a” followed by a number, “by”,
another number, “grid” and a period. A &lt;b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'&gt;&lt;i 
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'&gt;moveStatement &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;contains a &lt;b

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;and a &lt;b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'&gt;&lt;i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;BNF, or Backus-Naur Form, is an important notation that
Irony uses to understand grammar definitions. If you are not familiar with it,
no sweat, it’s easy to pick up. There are plenty of quick online tutorials, and
Google is your friend.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Luckily, there is almost a direct syntactic translation
of this BNF description into C# through Irony’s use of overriding operators. First,
we must define our Terminals and NonTerminals. Terminals are often predefined
constructs, like a number or string. Here, our only Terminal is a number, which
we’ll define in terms of a regular expression as “a series of one or more
digits”:&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:navy;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;RegexBasedTerminal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-no-proof:yes'&gt; &lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:red'&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:navy'&gt;RegexBasedTerminal&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;number&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;[0-9]+&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Everything else in our language is defined as a
NonTerminal like so:&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:navy;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;NonTerminal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span

mso-no-proof:yes'&gt; &lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;program&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:red'&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:navy'&gt;NonTerminal&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;program&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:.5in'&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:teal;

font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt; 
&lt;span style='color:red'&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:navy'&gt;NonTerminal&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;createStatement&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:.5in'&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:teal;
mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;startStatement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt; 
&lt;span style='color:red'&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:navy'&gt;NonTerminal&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;startStatement&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:.5in'&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:teal;
mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;moveStatements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt; 
&lt;span style='color:red'&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:navy'&gt;NonTerminal&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;moveStatements&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:.5in'&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:teal;

style='color:navy'&gt;NonTerminal&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;moveStatement&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:.5in'&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:teal;
mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;direction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt; &lt;span

style='color:navy'&gt;NonTerminal&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;direction&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Each string in the NonTerminal constructor will be
important later on when we navigate a parsed tree. Now we can translate the BNF
statements into something Irony can understand. The following is the real meat
of our language.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:green;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:teal;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;program&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
color:red;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:teal;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;Rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-no-proof:yes'&gt; &lt;span style='color:red'&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;createStatement&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span style='color:red'&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;startStatement&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span style='color:red'&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;moveStatements&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;This should look familiar; this was the first statement
in our BNF rules. &lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Saying &lt;b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'&gt;&lt;i 
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'&gt;this&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;intuitively means “&lt;b 
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'&gt;&lt;i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'&gt;this&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
before &lt;b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'&gt;&lt;i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'&gt;that.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;” Similarly, &lt;b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'&gt;&lt;i 
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'&gt;this&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:red;

&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Anytime a string literal is the first element used in a
rule statement, as in both rules above, it’s good practice to put a ToTerm() function
surrounding the string. It’s not required, but erroneous parsing will occur if
ToTerm is not used like this.&lt;/p&gt;

style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;Move&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span style='color:red'&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:teal'&gt;direction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:red'&gt; +&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span

style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:teal;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;direction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
color:red;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:teal;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;Rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-no-proof:yes'&gt; &lt;span style='color:red'&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;ToTerm&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span 
style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;up&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span style='color:red'&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;down&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:red'&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;right&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:red'&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;left&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Unfortunately, there is not a very easy way to describe the
“one or more” and “zero or more” rules. These are called “plus” and “star”
rules, respectively, which are drawn from a similar concept in Regex
expressions. Irony uses the MakePlusRule and MakeStarRule function to define
them. Both are used the same way syntactically, and MakePlusRule can be seen above
in the &lt;b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'&gt;&lt;i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'&gt;moveStatements&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; rule.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
One more statement is required to finish the grammar:&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:blue;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
color:red;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:teal;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;Root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-no-proof:yes'&gt; &lt;span style='color:red'&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;program&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;And another statement that will help keep the tree
“clean”:&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:teal;
mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;MarkPunctuation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;(&lt;span 
style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;Create&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;grid&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;by&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;Start&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;at&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'&gt;&lt;span 
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
color:purple;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;&amp;quot;location&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;, &lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span 
style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;Move&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;We’ll discuss this last statement in a little more depth
in section IV. That’s it! We have adequately defined a GridWorld grammar to
parse a GridWorld program. See the appendix for the complete &lt;span 
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
color:navy;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;GridWorldGrammar &lt;/span&gt;class.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:16.0pt'&gt;III. Parsing source code
&amp;amp; validating syntax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Let’s say we have a GUI that has a Textbox, a Button, and
a Label. Our Textbox will allow the user to type or paste source code that is
in GridWorld syntax. Once a user places their code there, they press the
Button, and the Label will state whether or not the syntax is of the right
form. &lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;With Irony, this is a very simple operation. Here is a
function that returns whether or not some given source code with a given
grammar object is valid:&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:blue;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-no-proof:yes'&gt; &lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:
teal'&gt;isValid&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:teal'&gt;sourceCode&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style='color:navy'&gt;Grammar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:teal'&gt;grammar&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:
yes&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:navy'&gt;LanguageData&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;language&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:red'&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:blue'&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:navy'&gt;LanguageData&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span 
style='color:teal'&gt;grammar&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:
yes&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:navy'&gt;Parser&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;parser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:red'&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:blue'&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:navy'&gt;Parser&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span 
style='color:teal'&gt;language&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:
yes&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:navy'&gt;ParseTree&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;parseTree&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:red'&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:teal'&gt;parser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:red'&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='color:teal'&gt;Parse&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;sourceCode&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:
yes&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:navy'&gt;ParseTreeNode&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;root&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:red'&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:teal'&gt;parseTree&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:red'&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='color:teal'&gt;Root&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:
yes&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;root&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:red'&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:blue'&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;The method this function uses is simple: attempt to parse
the given source code with the given grammar’s rules. If this attempt fails,
then the source code is not valid. Otherwise, it is valid. In this case we know
the parsing failed when the root of the parsed tree doesn’t exist (is of null
value). &lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Obviously, there are different ways to implement this
code just as there are different ways to describe our GridWorld language to
Irony in the previous section. It is strongly suggested to explore other
possibilities, increase understanding and knowledge of how Irony works, and
thus reap the full benefits of the Irony tool.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:16.0pt'&gt;IV. Navigating the
language tree &amp;amp; validating content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;We’ve seen how Irony offers an easy and fast way to
validate syntax. Now we’re going to take a look at how to examine the content
of a parsed language tree. The following code is a function that returns the
root of a parsed language tree. As you can see, it looks very similar to the
isValid function above.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;

style='color:teal'&gt;getRoot&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:teal'&gt;sourceCode&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style='color:navy'&gt;Grammar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:teal'&gt;grammar&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;language&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:red'&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span

&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;By using this function, we can explore and display source
code in a robust manner. We’ll use the following function to display the tree in
the DOS screen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Now, let’s parse some code and compare outputs. Recall this
statement we used at the very end of the grammar in section III:&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:

mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;MarkPunctuation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;(&lt;span 
style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;Create&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;grid&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;by&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;Start&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;at&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'&gt;&lt;span 
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
color:purple;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;&amp;quot;location&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;, &lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span 
style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;Move&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;If we had not included this statement, the parsed tree
from the source code in Figure 1 would look like that of Figure 2. However,
since we added the statement to “help keep the tree clean,” the parsed tree
looks like Figure 3. As you can see, MarkPunctuation is a very handy function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Note: the names in this tree do not derive from the names
of the Terminal and NonTerminal variables we used when defining the grammar,
but rather from the string argument sent to the constructor of each variable
when they were each declared. &lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;There are a number of ways to now go about reading the
tree and producing some output. Note that this means your language is an
interpreted language, not a compiled language; you must write the interpreter.
I cooked up a function that uses the tree format in Figure 3 to create a grid
similar to the one in section 1. See it in the appendix or in the example code
included with this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Checking content, as well as validating syntax, is an
important part of validating a language source code. This is because being able
to determine which parts of code are incorrect or correct allows the developer
to communicate to the user, often through syntax highlighting. &lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;For example, the function I wrote to display a grid from
the language tree here can be easily broken if the user writes GridWorld code
that goes off the grid, or tells the interpreter to start at a location not on
the grid. These mistakes certainly wouldn’t be caught by the syntax validator
function seen above; they are practically run-time errors. The developer could
decide to check for these sort of errors, and then highlight the offending
numbers in red. Thus, a user’s confusion and frustration can easily be avoided
by making use of a content-checker. &lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;That’s all there is to making a simple domain-specific
language parser with Irony!&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Please
see Code Appendix One or the included source code to view what was discussed in
the last few sections.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;The next section will deal with using some of Irony’s
more advanced tools, and then I will go into how to maintain a slightly more
complex language called “Manchester Syntax” that I created during the summer of
2010. &lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:16.0pt'&gt;V. Irony’s tools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;See the README.txt file in the irony-XXXXX folder that
you downloaded from http://irony.codeplex.com/
for information on how to use Irony’s grammar explorer. &lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a CAPTCHA killer. It needs nothing on the form except a hidden field and some server-side code. 

== PHP Example ==
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
//... Your lovely form here
// Example, please adapt
echo &quot;&lt;input type=hidden name=url /&gt;&quot;;
//... Rest of your lovely form here
&lt;/source&gt;

=== verification ===
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
// compare
if ($_POST['url'] != &quot;&quot;) {
 // abort!
}
// processing code here
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Removing Subjects ==

=== Remove and auto-removed ===
In the course of your trial, chances are that you will have to &quot;remove&quot; a subject, or trial-participant. You can do this by using the menu-option Tasks-Administration-Subjects. In the list with all subjects you scroll to your Subject or you filter the list to get the right person. Then you click on the X-icon and the status of the person will change from &quot;available&quot; to &quot;removed&quot;.
So far so good. But you may be surprised to see the Subject still in the Subject-matrix and with status &quot;auto-removed&quot;.

First of all the difference between &quot;removed&quot; and &quot;auto-removed&quot;. &quot;Subject&quot; is one level higher than &quot;Study Subject&quot;, so if you remove a subject in the way described above, you remove the top-level and the sub-levels are &quot;auto-removed&quot;.
To see the same difference: Use the Subject-matrix and click on the magnifying glass-icon. Here you see option &quot;Study Subject Record&quot; (top) and &quot;Global Subject Record&quot; (bottom).

=== Cleaning your subject matrix ===
It is expected behaviour that after you &quot;remove&quot; a Study Subject or even after you &quot;remove&quot; a Subject, this person still shows up in the subject matrix, due to regulations.
If you do not want your list to get cluttered, consider creating an extra site for your study called &quot;RemovedSubjects&quot; or another appropriate name. You can assign Subjects to this site after &quot;removing&quot; them. This way they will not show up in the regular Subject-matrix.
Remember that this will only work if you specify assign users to one or more Study-sites, as opposed to assigning them to the whole Study.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This version of the Anti-CAPTCHA is stronger.

== Form Code ==
=== JavaScript ===
&lt;source lang=javascript&gt;
document.write(&quot;&lt;input type=hidden name=code value=&quot;+Math.random()+&quot; /&gt;&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

This must be in your form.

Use in an HTML form:
&lt;source lang=html4strict&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
document.write(&quot;&lt;input type=hidden name=code value=&quot;+Math.random()+&quot; /&gt;&quot;);
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Server-Side Code ===
Use this:
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
&lt;?php

if (!$_POST['code']) {
   // abort
}

?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Problems with this version ===
It hinders the usability, as people with JavaScript disabled (for example, for security reasons) won't be able to access your form.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Useful for any beginners to learn code from.

== PHP 4 &amp;amp; 5 ==

=== Basic Level ===
* &lt;code&gt;echo &quot;''the text to print''&quot;;&lt;/code&gt; - This language construct will echo the text between the quotes. This is not a function but a language construct.
* &lt;code&gt;echo &quot;$var&quot;;&lt;/code&gt; - Notice the double quotation marks. Because double quotation marks are used, this will print the '''value''' of the variable. If $var=&quot;Bobby&quot;, this will output:
Bobby
* &lt;code&gt;echo '$var';&lt;/code&gt; - Notice that the quotation marks are now single. This will output the literal keystrokes inside the quotes.  The example will output:
$var
* &lt;code&gt;$var=&quot;Jericho&quot;;echo &quot;Joshua fit the battle of $var.&quot;;&lt;/code&gt; - Other than substituting the value of a variable for the variable name (and one or two other minor items), double quotes will quote literal keystrokes.  So this will output:

Joshua fit the battle of Jericho.

Again, if single quotes were used — &lt;code&gt;'Joshua fit the battle of $var';&lt;/code&gt; — this would output:

Joshua fit the battle of $var.
* &lt;code&gt;echo $var;&lt;/code&gt; - If you only want to print the value of a variable, you don't need quotes at all. If the value of $var is &quot;1214&quot;, the code will output:
1214
* &lt;code&gt;require &quot;''url''&quot;;&lt;/code&gt; - This language construct will include the page between the quotes. Can NOT be used with dynamic pages, e.g. &lt;code&gt;require(&quot;''main.php?username=SomeUser''&quot;);&lt;/code&gt; would ''not'' work. This is not a function but a language construct.
* &lt;code&gt;date(&quot;''Date/time format''&quot;);&lt;/code&gt; - Function which returns a date from a Unix Timestamp - where H is the hour, i is the minutes, s is the seconds, d is the day, m is the month and Y is the year in four digits - e.g. &lt;code&gt;date(&quot;H:i:s d/m/Y&quot;);&lt;/code&gt; would return &lt;code&gt;12:22:01 10/08/2006&lt;/code&gt; on 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; August 2006 at 12:22:01.
* &lt;code&gt;unlink(&quot;''filename''&quot;);&lt;/code&gt; - Function which deletes the file specified in ''filename''.

== PHP 4 ==
=== Basic Level ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
  $variable1 = 'beginning';
  //This is a comment after a variable being defined
  if ($variable1 == 'beginning') {
    //If is a test to see if a variable has certain
    //value and initiates the wanted sequences if true
    echo 'Hello World!';
    //The echo displays to the page
  }
else
{
echo 'some code';
}

?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== OOP ===
Include OOP based examples, made by experienced developer

== PHP 5 Only ==

=== Basic Level ===
Basics, working only on PHP 5.

* &lt;code&gt;file_put_contents(&amp;quot;''filename''&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;''Text to save''&amp;quot;);&lt;/code&gt; - Functions which saves the text specified in ''Text to save'' to the file specified in ''filename''. Will overwrite existing file contents unless another parameter FILE_APPEND is added.
E.g. &lt;code&gt;file_put_contents(&amp;quot;''filename''&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;''Text to save''&amp;quot;);&lt;/code&gt; will write ''Text to save'' to ''filename'', but will overwrite existing text whereas &lt;code&gt;file_put_contents(&amp;quot;''filename''&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;''Text to save''&amp;quot;, FILE_APPEND);&lt;/code&gt; will write ''Text to save'' to ''filename'', but will '''not''' overwrite existing text (instead it appends).

=Marketing in educational development=

[[File:Billboard WikiWorld.png|thumb|400px]]
In contrast to traditional marketing approaches, educational engagement with social media can directly compliment marketing efforts in organisations.  The educational benefits of marketing approaches which allocate resources to branding and brand awareness campaigns such as billboards, newspaper advertisements, 15 second television and radio commercials, sponsorship, calendars and diaries, a website, open days, visitations and international representations may not be realised. The effort and expense of promoting study at an institution by using glossy, promising messages may potentially be undone by a form of marketing which cannot be controlled: word-of-mouth through social media. Word of mouth messages go far and wide once the reality of the educational experience is apparent, therefore, sufficient resourcing to ensure the quality and delivery of the product is paramount.  Social media has a vast and impressive potential not only for marketing but also for learning, research, education, and assessment.

This article sets out a proposal for ensuring marketing expenditure is used to improve the quality of teaching resources, while at the same time achieving significant results in the brand and awareness objectives that marketing departments traditionally engage in.

For example, if the money that is typically spent on a billboard, is used to produce and publish a series of video recorded lectures, panels, interviews or mini documentaries, with added branding information normally used on the billboard, they can be uploaded to Youtube. The views and response rates will be significantly higher than for a billboard.  If the lecture videos are packaged with links to readings and resources, timetables, assignments and assessment criteria in courses, they can be easily accessed as free resources on popular social media channels, and used for self directed study. If reduced fees are offered to people who are using these open educational resources for self directed study for assessment and certification services, there is an immediate and complimentary relationship between marketing resources and educational development using online social media.  The benefits are substantial.

By rethinking marketing expenditure, and educational services in this way, an educational institution's marketing department is not only generating glossy, promising messages and brand awareness, they are also helping lecturers to produce glossy educational resources as well, and helping communities to find better access to information for both formal and informal learning.

=The point of difference=

Producing open educational resources is not new. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_OpenCourseWare Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Open Courseware] was an early mover in this direction - but criticised for the quality and depth of their resources. Many other universities have set up open education initiatives ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCourseWare Wikipedia, 2010)].  However, few of these universities are taking advantage of the full opportunity before them, using popular channels of social media for education instead of centralising their efforts on their own web spaces.

=Use media that is free for reuse=
It is feasible, given the right librarian support, that a teacher can prepare readings and educational resources free from copyright restrictions. There is a multitude of open resources available.  For example, three and a half million, and counting, English Wikipedia articles, seven and a half million, and counting, multimedia resources in Wikimedia Commons, 36 million, and counting, free images on Flickr Creative Commons, as well as countless video and audio on the Internet Archive, and still more resources available on the Internet which can be found via the Creative Commons Search.  It is necessary to develop a method for surveying and monitoring free content in specific subject areas as it is added and updated. A simple Internet search will not yield helpful results, whereas subscribing to search results, and networking with others who also monitor the subject area, will help grow libraries of free and reusable content - using a variety of subject-specific Commons.  Investments and returns on content production can be much better estimated and targeted when a solid awareness of the strengths and weaknesses in having a number of subject-specific Commons becomes apparent.

=Add Creative Commons=

An ''All Rights Reserved'' default for copyright permissions is generally how copyright is typically managed in educational institutions.  This makes it difficult for staff to use more permissive licenses, and there may be no procedures in place for staff to deal with commercialisation and intellectual property (IP) challenges surrounding their work.  Ideally, when an education institution reviews policies on intellectual property, it needs to add a clause that enables and supports staff who want to use [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_commons ''Creative Commons''] copyright licensing arrangements. Following Otago Polytechnic's lead of using [http://wikieducator.org/Otago_Polytechnic:_An_IP_policy_for_the_times an open IP policy], it is best to set [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_licenses#Original_licenses ''Creative Commons Attribution''] (CC By) as the default copyright license recommended by the institution.  Additionally, this needs to include a process for staff and partners to opt-out, and restrict copyrights if they need to - leading to consultation around commercialisation, protections or perhaps education on the benefits of licensing for reuse. This approach works to the benefit of any Commercialisation Unit or IP Unit that the institution may have, or may be considering, because the opt-out process works to alert the unit thus helping them manage their work more effectively. By defaulting to a Creative Commons Attribution license, with an opt-out process, anyone who decides against using an Attribution only license, would be contacted by staff from the IP Unit or Commercialisation Unit who assist with the application of copyright restrictions, and can help to progress alternative processes for the intellectual property.

=The development of five showcase courses=

Changing the IP policy to one that gives options for open education and research practices will generate public attention, but if there is little or no follow-through this will only undo the benefits of that attention once people realise the shallowness of the development. In many ways, this is a weakness in the work done at Otago Polytechnic around the IP policy. To date there has been little progress in coordinating library, marketing and IT services effectively to support teachers and researchers to take their work into a more public arena. Yet, despite the necessary support, [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Open_Education_Practices:_A_User_Guide_for_Organisations/Measuring_Open_Education an analysis of their effort] to use social media to produce open educational resources and practices, revealed a 50% return in the first year of the investment.

:''&quot;It cost Otago Polytechnic $4 000 to properly train one teacher/researcher how to effectively use popular social media in their work, and in the first year that teacher/researcher generated a return of $8 000 worth of marketing, infrastructural savings and quality improvements to their work.&quot;''

With such a return it is arguable that a greater investment can be made. Perhaps one that involves a commitment to resource production expenses as well as the support and development needed by staff, and improved ICT and administration services which compliment rather than limit the use of popular social media. A strategic investment could leverage even greater returns than what has already been demonstrated as a result of the efforts of a small number of motivated individuals.

Any institution could start by identifying at least five examples of courses for educational development, and produce them using an open education model. This development would involve re-design, resource production, staff training and intensive support. The objective would be to bring staff members to a point where they can work independently with the materials and media in an enhanced and publicly accessible course.


;&lt;big&gt;Production&lt;/big&gt;
A production schedule and budget for developing one open course is presented by Leigh Blackall.  This is a budget for producing high quality learning resources, published to popular social media channels, and for preparing a teacher to run the course openly online for at least three instances of the course.  The budget also includes costs for evaluation processes associated with the design, development and implementation of the open course, including the effectiveness of the materials, the achievement of learning outcomes and teacher and student satisfaction.


;&lt;big&gt;Production team&lt;/big&gt;
*Teacher - a content expert who is an open education practitioner, and has an interesting angle to exploit.
*Educational developer - a teacher trainer and mentor who understands effective educational design in an open environment, and can provide liaison with the production team.  This person understands the bigger picture, the constraints on the teacher's time, the design and production process, and can use a range of technology to an expert level.
* Librarian - an individual who understands Web 2.0 social networking approaches, and has a high level of digital information literacy.
*Treatment and script writer - a highly creative individual who is a lateral thinker, outside the box, and is knowledgeable and up to date with social media and open education, and able to script content imaginatively in a pedagogically sound manner.
*Director and production manager - an organised person and lateral thinker who is able to run on a tight budget with minimal resources, while being creative.
*Camera and sound operator, and editor - this person is skilled with camera and sound recording, has an eye for detail and quality, and is fast working with a 'one take' approach.
*Graphic designer and social media developer - this individual has a strong online communication prescence and experience with skills in HTML, CSS and MediaWiki skills. This person understands open education and the philosophy of the Wikimedia Foundation. 
*Researcher - a person who has strong research evaluation skills to lead the evaluation processes. 


;&lt;big&gt;Production schedule&lt;/big&gt;
# An initial meeting is held between the teacher, educational developer, treatment and script writer and director to establish a creative approach to the course that is to be developed.
# A treatment and script is drafted, and a 'mock-up' is developed for review with stakeholders (teachers, students, managers, marketing, industry etc.) before settling on the approach.
# A course website is developed to document the production and to eventually become the main site for the course.
# The graphic designer begins branding the site.
# The course outline is loaded to the open platform selected for the venture (e.g., WikiEducator, Wikiversity, WikiBooks etc.). The online presence for the course is simple and integrated into related pages across WikiMedia Foundation projects.
# The librarian uses Delicious social bookmarking and Zontero to create an online library of resources for the topics in the course, periodically posting annotations about the resources to the Delicious stream for the course.
# The teacher reviews the resources and adds any of use, preferably via an RSS feed, to the course Wiki.  
# A production schedule is developed according to the teacher's time allocation for developing the course, and preferably before the course is taught.
# Videos, audio recordings, photos and slide presentations are produced and published to social media sites. For example: Blip.tv, Internet Archive, Youtube, Slideshare, Flickr and Wikimedia Commons. All descriptions about the resources link to the course website. All media is bookmarked to Delicious, blogged about and tweeted (on Twitter).
# The wandiki is updated with links to recorded media, and supporting texts are developed (transcripts, user guides, and activities etc.)
# The course is finally packaged with promotion videos, graphic design material, the website, using a stable wiki platform, and distributed media which has been produced.
# Training and support is provided to the teacher, and is given for the duration of the first iteration of the open course. 


;&lt;big&gt;Budget&lt;/big&gt;
*Teacher - $50 per hour - 60hrs additional to normal teaching and preparation = $3 000 - see notes below.
*Librarian - $50 per hour - 20hrs = $1 000.
*Educational developer - $50 per hour - 60hrs = $3  000.
*Treatment and script writer - $100 per hour - 20hrs = $2 000.
*Director and production manager - $50 per hour - 40hrs = $2 000.
*Camera, sound and editor - $50 per hour - 100hrs = $5 000.
*Graphic designer and social media developer - $100 per hour - 50hrs = $5 000.
*Researcher - $50 per hour - 40hrs = $2 000.
*Research evaluation costs - $500.
*Catering - $500.
*Materials - $500.
*Contingency - $1 000.
*'''Total = $25 500.'''

'''Disclaimer:''' the hours and the costs in the budget are an approximation and will vary. This is not necessarily a model of production for open education supported by Otago Polytechnic. However, in an endeavor to produce high quality and marketable showcase courses this approach is probably necessary. 

'''Notes:''' the time for the teacher is reliant on the amount of time spent on reviewing resources found by the librarian, and materials produced by the team.  The more time a teacher spends on the development of his or her skills and capability in accessing and managing digital information, and learning to use technologies and strategies for an open education model, the less reliant he or she will be on others in the future.

=Reasons to use popular social media=

There are a number of reasons for using popular social media sites. Exposure to a wider audience is guaranteed, and a well-packaged course can be used, not only to market an individual or an organisation, but also to attract both formal students who enroll, and informal participants who may enroll at a later date.  For example, Harvard Law has twice presented open courses well packaged around popular social media. Firstly, in 2008, with their [http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/cyberone/category/blog/ Law in the Court of Public Opinion] - where they used Blip.tv, Second Life, a Wiki and a Blog to run the course for formal and informal enrollments simultaneously. Secondly, in 2010, with [http://www.justiceharvard.org/ Justice] - a course heavily reliant on Youtube to present a TV-like series around the subject. 

In comparison, leading open educational initiatives like MIT Open Courseware, Utah State University and Johns Hopkins University use their own web spaces for educational media although it is available freely online.  This approach undoubtedly misses a large majority of people using the Internet for informal learning, as they browse through more popular channels for information such as Youtube and Wikipedia. Closer to home is the [http://www.youtube.com/unsw University of New South Wales] on Youtube, where it features some of its better lectures. 

None of these examples, however, are sophisticated in their use of social media, nor do any of them go beyond mere marketing, such as linking the media to actual teaching and assessment, and opportunities for formal and informal learning in an open environment.
Many authors speak of cautions around using social media for marketing; for example, Andreas Kaplan states, in ''[http://www.michaelhaenlein.eu/Publications/Kaplan,%20Andreas%20-%20Users%20of%20the%20world,%20unite.pdf Users of the world, unite]'' &quot;Choosing the right medium for any given purpose depends on the target group to be reached and the message to be communicated.&quot;

=A better approach to social media=

There are many benefits for open educational practitioners in packaging and publishing quality material and learning experiences across popular social media channels. It is an excellent way for them to show case their work, and the work of the organisation, while raising their individual profile globally.   One way to do this packaging and distribution is to record 'lectures' (in the broader understanding of the term - including panel discussions, interviews and mini documentaries) on a range of topics, and link them to supporting study material, and assessment schedules. When 'lectures' are produced for authenticity, and are short and engaging, they are useful to people studying the subject for interest as well as for certification. Videos of 'lectures' can be loaded to Youtube, both on the lecturer's channel and on the institution's channel and playlist, with copies spread across other video sites such as Blip.tv, and backed up on the National Archive or library website. Youtube becomes the focal point for the video material.

As well as producing a video series, each course uses a Wiki page (e.g., WikiEducator or Wikiversity) and lists the schedule of topics.  It is necessary to ensure that all readings and resources have copyright release for use on Wikiversity, or are at least openly available online. The Wiki page also includes instructions for the assignments and the assessment criteria. If a textbook is used in the course, the textbook, if possible, could be added to Wikibooks, with a print version available under normal royalty arrangements. This work is ideally  done in the spirit of collaboration, with the institution positioning itself as one of potentially many providers of teaching and assessment services that compliment the Wiki study materials. Once complete, a link to these pages can be placed on all related Wikipedia articles, and Youtube videos, and other prominent websites.

Each course needs a website where all the resources are gathered and compiled in one central place. Links to this website are included in the description text for all the videos and wiki pages. This website is primarily used for announcements and updates on the course and its development, as well as notes, examples and feedback on work submitted by people undertaking study in the course. A Blog is ideal for use as a course website, and simple to set up and maintain.

=Position assessment and certification services for new 'markets'=

[[File:FEMA - 32438 - Preliminary Damage Assessment meeting in Ohio for Public Assistance.jpg|thumb|400px]]
The courses that are packaged and published this way need to be designed in such a way to be useful both to people interested in learning, as well as people seeking assessment and certification services. In other words, the stated learning objectives, assignments and assessment criteria need to be aligned and robust enough for both self-directed (informal) learners using the open educational resources independently, as well as for learners who have enrolled (formal), and are seeking teaching and learning support services while they study.

Informal learners can simply engage with the materials, and where appropriate participate in the discussions and forums, and perhaps gain access to laboratories and equipment as a fee-for-service arrangement, and complete and submit assignments for assessment. Assessment and certification services can take place when a person enrolls in the course, which essentially takes place when the informal participant is confident of a completion. By making it possible to enroll on completion, there may be a  positive impact on performance indicators such as retention and completion rates which have an impact on funding for the course. Therefore, only those participants who are likely to complete are enrolling for assessment services, and 100% completion rates are possible.  It is also likely there will be very high satisfaction and continuation rates, not to mention more successful and motivated students engaging in fee paying services.

This open educational design aims to attract people already in full time work, and aiming to make career changes. For example, there may be parents seeking distant and self paced study options, or people in regional and remote areas reluctant or unable to relocate to a city for study. Potential participants may be experienced and/or self-directed learners seeking recognition for their knowledge and skills, or local and international people looking for less expensive study and certification options. As yet, most universities do very little in identifying and servicing this sort of demand.

As long as the developments compliment the needs of the enrolled students, development for open educational options will simply expose an organisation to possible new 'markets'. By engaging marketing resources and librarian support in improving media and resources used for teaching and learning, and ensuring the materials are publicly available using social media, not only is there an improvement to services for existing students, but new 'markets' are serviced as well.

=Train and support teaching staff=
As mentioned previously in the guidebook in [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Open_Education_Practices:_A_User_Guide_for_Organisations/Measuring_Open_Education Measuring Open Education], the return on investment if training and supporting teaching staff to use open educational practices is cost effective and well worth the effort.  The calculations associated with the return on investment are described in the section about [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Open_Education_Practices:_A_User_Guide_for_Organisations/Measuring_Open_Education#Gains.2C_savings_and_costs Gains, savings and costs].

Building capability and skills in using digital information effectively is essential if staff are to become open educational practitioners, and develop the dispositions required to participate actively and collaboratively in rapidly changing digital environments (Hegarty et al, 2010). For example, open content and mobile computing are expected to become mainstream by 2011, and electronic books are increasingly being used for education (Johnson, Levine, Smith &amp; Stone, 2010). &quot;Digital media literacy continues its rise in importance as a key skill in every discipline and profession&quot;, but there is still much work to be done in providing relevant professional development which will help to change belief patterns and practices to accommodate the trends in technologies for teaching and learning (Johnson et al, 2010, p. 5).

=Summary=
Therefore, organisational strategies for supporting open educational practices are key, not only for harnessing the marketing opportunities which open content presents, but also to help educational institutions to actively participate in the provision of learning which meets the demands of 21st Century workers. More and more people are needing to access education flexibly when they need it, and in ways which enable them to retain their jobs and lifestyles (Johnson et al, 2010). There is also a lot of pressure on educational organisations to cut costs, therefore, they are seeking cost-effective approaches to teaching and learning. The proposal offered here is one approach which can do this.  It is based on research involving staff practices, and includes the calculation of the return on investment for Otago Polytechnic when using open educational practices.

The '''Holden Astra''' is a [[compact car]] currently being manufactured by [[General Motors]] and sold through the [[Holden]] brand. The current Astra model is a [[badge engineering|rebadged]] [[Opel Astra]].

== First generation (1984–1989) ==
The 1984 '''Holden Astra LB''',  was a [[badge engineering|rebadged]] [[Nissan Pulsar]] (badged as the [[Nissan Cherry]] in [[Europe]]), built in [[Australia]] and sold only on the [[Australian]] market.

The Pulsars sold in Australia at that time were related to the [[Nissan Langley]], while the Astra had a Pulsar-like grille designed by Australian stylist [[Paul Beranger]] housing the [[Holden]] lion badge. These versions were known as the LB and LC.

All versions were powered by a 1.5-litre engine which was a [[Nissan]] design, locally manufactured, and were offered in two trim levels, the SL/X and the SL/E. 
Unlike its Nissan counterpart, the Astra was only offered as a five-door hatchback, with the three-door [[hatchback]], four-door [[sedan]] and five-door [[station wagon]] body styles omitted from the range due to fears they would overlap with Nissan's own [[Pulsar]] range. In a way this was similar to the [[Alfa Romeo Arna]] sold in [[Europe]],which was also released in the same year.

In 1986, the Astra was now known as the '''Holden Astra LC''' and there was no major mechanical changes, the car was [[facelift]]ed with no trim level change.

== Second generation (1987–1989) ==
[[Image:Astra SV1800.jpg‎|thumb|right|HSV Astra SV1800]]
The [[Nissan Pulsar|Pulsar]] was again used as the basis for the Astra. This model was now known as the '''Holden Astra LD'''.
It was sold in Australia (but not [[New Zealand]]) between 1987 and 1989. 

The new Astra was launched in July 1987, and was discontinued in June 1989.

==Bodystyles==
As with its predecessor, only a five-door hatchback and four-door sedan were available. A three-door hatchback version was never available, even though its [[Nissan Pulsar]] sister version had one, and there was no wagon version either (Nissan had two [[family car]] station wagons, a Pulsar wagon, and the [[Nissan Sunny|Nissan Sunny California]]).

===Engines and transmissions===
Engines available for the Astra LD included a 1.6 or 1.8 litre engine, both of which were their own [[in-house]] design, rather than Nissan. All had [[fuel injection]], and were badged 1.6i or 1.8i. They were known as the ''[[GM Family II engine|Family II]]'' series engines when used in the Australian-built Pulsars and Astras. 
{{quote|This was ironic considering that by now Holden had dropped the Pulsar-based Astra for the less-successful [[Toyota Corolla]]-derived [[Holden Nova|Nova]].|Trading Post Auto's/Auto Trader Australia}}
All Astra models had a disc/drum brake setup, whereas the equivalent Australian Pulsars had 4-wheel disc brakes as standard.

===Versions available===
There were three versions available: SL, SL/E and SL/X. 
SL trim level was the entry-level variant, and it had a 1.6-litre Family II engine, badged as 1.6i. This had 5-speed manual transmission only. This came as a five-door hatchback only.
SL/E trim level was slightly higher-specification than the SL variant, and was available with the 1.8i engine only. Both 5-speed manual and automatic transmissions were available.
SL/X trim level was the highest specification offered, and had both 1.6i and 1.8i engines available, and both transmissions were offered. This was equivalent to Nissan's GL specification offered on the related Pulsar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.redbookasiapacific.com/au/vehicle/vehicles.php?make=HOLD&amp;family=PSASTRA&amp;year=19880 |title=RedBook AU - Your site for New and Used Vehicle Prices - Holden Astra LD|publisher= REDBOOK.COM.AU| accessdate=2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response in the motoring press===
The car was considered to be better than its 1983-1987 forebear by the Australian edition of ''[[Auto Trader]]''. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www1.autotrader.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/familyTree?Readform&amp;make=Holden&amp;model=Astra | title = Used Car Safety Ratings 2007 | publisher = Trading Post Auto's | accessdate = 2007-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HSV variant===
[[Holden Special Vehicles]] also offered a version of the LD Astra marketed as the '''HSV Astra SV1800'''. The SV1800 was available as a sedan or a hatchback with the majority using the sedan bodystyle. Approximately 65 total cars were sold. Upgrades from a standard Astra to the Astra SV1800 were limited to cosmetic changes. Engine specifications for the standard Astra LD and the Astra SV1800 were identical.

===Associations with Nissan &amp; the [[Button Plan]] ===
In 1989, all associations with [[Nissan]] were severed and a new agreement between [[Toyota]] and [[Holden]] was formed instead. 
This agreement (part of the [[Button Plan]] created [[United Australian Automobile Industries]] (UAAI). 

== Third generation (1996–1998) ==
[[Image:Vauxhall-Astra-Mk3.jpg|220px|thumb|right|A 1991-1998 [[Vauxhall Astra]] 1.6i 16v CDX 5-door]]
After the [[Button Plan]] had ended, Holden opted to return to marketing rebadged [[General Motors]] vehicles. 
The third-generation Astra, which was known as the '''Holden Astra TR''' was designed by [[Opel]], another subsidiary of [[General Motors]] located in [[Germany]]. 

In 1995, Holden began selling the Astra again in the [[New Zealand]] market. This version of the Astra was named the Astra TR, and was imported from the [[United Kingdom]]. However, this was merely a rebadging of an existing Opel product: the [[Opel Astra]] had in fact been sold there since 1993.

In 1996, Holden then began selling the car in Australia. The Astra TR was Holden's version of the [[Opel Astra#Opel Astra F|Opel Astra F]]. 

Much like the rebadged versions from the 1980s, there was little difference between the Opel Astra F and the Holden Astra TR.

== Fourth generation (1998–2005) ==
[[Image:2000 Holden Astra.jpg|thumb|2000 Holden TS Astra CD]]

In 1998, the Astra was replaced again with a German-sourced version. Known as the '''Holden TS Astra''', it was equipped with either a 1.6, 1.8 or a 2.2 16V petrol engine and was offered in a City, CD, CDXi, the SXi and the SRi specifications. The SRi was three-door hatchback only, and the standard Astra was only available with a 1.6 litre 16-valve engine. The TS Astra was similar to the [[Chevrolet Astra]] of [[South America]], although the styling was slightly different. The curves of the original body were retained, though it was softer in design, and not as sharp as the South American counterpart. 

The TS Astra model change followed that of the [[Opel Astra#Astra G|Opel Astra G]] range, including the sedan hatchback and convertible. However, the Coupé by [[Bertone]] was not offered with a Holden badge. The drivetrain was identical to other cars in in the Astra lineup, and as such, was not a bona-fide sports car. Like the Astra A, the Astra B was available as a wagon in New Zealand, but not Australia. In 2003, a 2.0 litre Turbo engine became available. The standard Astra was only available with a 1.8 litre 16-valve engine, and lived on until 2005 as the '''Holden Astra Classic''', alongside the new model. The philosophy behind this was for Holden to remain competitive in the market until the cheaper [[Daewoo Lacetti|Viva]] model was introduced.

== Fifth generation (2004–present) ==
[[File:2006–2007 Holden AH Astra (MY07) CDTi 5-door hatchback 01.jpg|thumb|right|2004-2007 Holden AH Astra]]

The fifth generation '''Holden AH Astra''' was now based on the [[Opel Astra#Astra H|Opel Astra H]]. This five-door hatchback was sold in [[Australia]] from December 2004, selling alongside the [[Poland|Polish]]-built Astra G, which carried &quot;Astra Classic&quot; badges. However, the Astra Classic was dropped in late 2005, and replaced by the new '''Holden Viva''', a rebadged [[Daewoo Lacetti]]. It continues in [[Poland]] as the Opel Astra Classic.

In August 2005, the Astra Wagon was released in Australia, but not in New Zealand where the [[Holden Viva]] wagon had replaced it. 

Diesel variants of the Astra were released in June 2006, which was a first for the Astra in [[Australasia]]. Two versions were offered: a six-speed [[manual transmission|manual]] option with a {{Auto kW|110|0}} 1.9 litre CDTi engine, and a six-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]] model with an {{Auto kW|88|0}} version of the same engine. In January 2007, Holden released the Astra SRi and Twintop. Both come with a 2.2 litre petrol engine producing {{Auto kW|110|0}}, available with the six-speed manual or four-speed automatic. The SRi is available in hatch and coupe bodystyles.

The current line-up consists of: CD, CDX, CDTi, SRi and SRi Turbo and the VXR.
CDXi was dropped after the arrival of the CDTi, which is similar to the CDXi physically but is higher-specced inside.

In mid-2007 the Astra line-up received a facelift including tweaked front grille and lights on all models, and a power upgrade with the 1.8 litre petrol engines from {{Auto kW|92|0}} to {{Auto kW|103|0}}, meaning a power increase of 11%. The engines available in the SRi, SRi Turbo and CDTi remain unchanged.

== Safety ==
In Australia, both the 1996-98 Holden Astra TR and the 1998-04 Holden Astra TS were assessed in the 2006 Used Car Safety Ratings as providing &quot;better than average&quot; protection for their occupants in the event of a crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/2007/pdf/Car_Safety_Ratings07.pdf | title = Used Car Safety Ratings 2007 | publisher = [[Monash University]] | accessdate = 2007-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AH models come with front and side impact airbags as standard inclusions.

From mid-way through 2006, the MY06.5 revision was released which includes head-protecting curtain airbags as standard equipment for tbe CDX variants.

The SRi and CDTi variants have standard [[Electronic Stability Control|ESP]] (Electronic Safety Program - a type of stability control).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Noob question: I followed this tutorial word-for-word but at the end the lights (on the vertices) are pointed strange ways. Is there something I should do to the sun before I click the Icosphere and hit '''CTRL'''+'''PKEY''' (i.e. positioning or rotation)? I'm going to try to use a lamp and see if that works at all. Update: Facepalm. I went through the tutorial again and found that I messed up last time. Let this be a warning to everyone: '''DON'T''' rotate the sun.

Noob comment: Perhaps you could clarify the phrase &quot;Global Illumination&quot; at the start of this page. I was expecting an explanation on how to fake true global illumination (ie radiosity), not just a constant light source.
-The Author, well, would you like me to call it faked genuine GI :)? If you want the features you're talking about, you would need to use http://yafaray.org/

Noob question: Where the tutorial instructs us to add the lamp, should that lamp be at the center of the sphere?</text>

Originally created by Writer68 with the edit summary &quot;* This is the original text of my NLP Practitioner manual which I am donating to Wikibooks. I have not edited it from the original except for removing the publisher details. NLP...&quot;.  on 30 June 2009. On 2 August 2010 same editor tagged it for speedy deletion with &quot;Copyrighted material must be removed&quot; as the edit summary. I have now tagged it as a potential copyvio. It does not really fit the speedy criteria. It may be a copyvio despite the original editor's &quot;release&quot; in the edit summary. I'm fairly happy this should be deleted but always feel it is a bit of a grey area so prefer to have a consensus. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 19:24, 5 August 2010 (UTC)

:Copyright violation of what?  &quot;Avoid copyright paranoia&quot; and all.  The closest thing I can find is this book at [http://books.google.com/books?id=1jBa5RVGjnEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google books], but it doesn't quite match up.  The user also asked for [[Creative Problem Solving]] to be deleted a bit back, and since they were the only significant contributor, I complied. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 21:50, 5 August 2010 (UTC)
::Yes, I looked and couldn't find an online source that suggested this was a copyvio. What I meant was I had tagged it as a copyvio as that seemed to be what Writer68 was trying to do by tagging for deletion with the comment about removing copyrighted material. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:12, 5 August 2010 (UTC)
:::However, it was the author himself/herself that tagged it as copyvio, so perhaps this can be deleted as an author request? [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 06:39, 6 August 2010 (UTC)
::::It is problematic to accept the request in those terms. I think the best option is to clearly indicate a verifiable link/reference (or at least to a low degree of uncertainty) of violation, that is the function and requirements of the copyvio tag, otherwise it needs to contact [[wikimedia:Designated agent]] to request a pull-down from Wikimedia.
::::If the copyvio tag or the talk page does not provide valid info about the claim, the tag should be removed from the work.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:42, 6 August 2010 (UTC)
:They claim the book is not available online, and is a manual produced (and they copyright owned by) the Society of NLP. Someone might contact that Society to confirm this. &amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;&lt;code style=&quot;color:#4B0082; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|mike]]@[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|en.wb]]:&amp;#126;$&amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt; 14:53, 11 August 2010 (UTC)
::'''Delete''': As NLP is just pseudoscience, I don't think we should try too hard to keep this book. Just my opinion! [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 19:01, 11 August 2010 (UTC)

:::We do have manuals, including the very popular [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]] and we do cover commercial software (hence the need for non-free use uploads).

:[[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete'''  After looking at some of other books in [[Subject:Web applications]] and looking on the site a bit more I feel this book violates [[WB:HOST]], as the site seems to be using us to provide a wiki for their own service. 13:34, 14 July 2010 (UTC) &lt;small&gt;—The preceding comment was added by [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|contribs]]) .&lt;/small&gt;
:Wait, I forgot the whole thing about OR. This also does not belong to WV because it's not educational. I'd say '''delete'''. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 14:35, 14 July 2010 (UTC)

::It is a bit different from [[WB:HOST]], we at Wikibooks are not only about educational content (that this manages to be) but also about free and reusable content. The use given to the content elsewhere shouldn't be of relevance to us if it complies to this two points. We can even say that if all comercial ventures released their manuals as a Wikibook and pointed to our project our situation regarding contributions, users and visibility would be dramatically changed.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:10, 14 July 2010 (UTC)
:::If it isn't [[WB:HOST]], then it's [[WB:OR]]; in fact, I think it exists in a sort of [[w:Quantum superposition|superposition of states]] between violating one [[w:Inclusive or|or]] the other of those.  It is apparently meant to be the primary documentation, which means that there is no external authority that can be consulted for verification, even in principle.  It seems to be, in essence, ''inherently'' a single-author work, with no potential for substantive wiki collaboration.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 17:39, 14 July 2010 (UTC)
::::I think I understand your point regarding &quot;primary source&quot; but that problem is not unique to this work, it all depends on how strict we are, consider for instance the [[MagicJack]] work ([[User talk:Az2008|I had a discussion with the contributor about NPOV]]).
::::I think the creator is promoting wiki collaboration as the original product itself points users here. From my reading of the present [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks?]] I don't see an objection (but understand that some effort is being put into establishing it more clearly, in the [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks/Unstable|unstable branch]] and even in the [[Wikibooks:Original research]] draft proposal), but in this case I think that it doesn't falls under research but direct description of something, I haven't examined it deeply but restricting the &quot;primary source&quot; in that way would also cover other works and even subjects in a similar way.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 22:23, 14 July 2010 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Mathematics]] ==
Hi, I noticed your working on the [[Calculus]] book, and I thought you might be interested to know about the mathematics wikiproject I have been trying to revive.  Basically it is a place to discuss various math specific issues that may come up (such as, why doesn't this TeX code work? etc.), or as well as a place to discuss any content related issues that may arise (how could we make these books work together better, how do I make a nice graphic for this page, etc.)   It is still a bit of a fledgling project at the moment, but it still might be handy to have on your radar. [[User:Thenub314|&lt;span style=&quot;color: #CC2200 ;&quot;&gt;Thenub314&lt;/span&gt;]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|&lt;span style=&quot;color: #CC2200 ;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]) 02:33, 19 August 2010 (UTC)

== Please participate ==
Hope you wouldn't mind participating on the &quot;vote&quot; to restore the [[Wikibooks:Administrators#Becoming_a_CheckUser|CheckUser (CU) function]] (mostly used to fight vandalism) to the Wikibooks project, a &lt;u&gt;minimum of 25 expressions of support is required&lt;/u&gt; to grant the flag to administrator Thenub314 (this will also enable admin Adrignola to get the function active again, since there is a minimum requirement of 2 active Wikibookians with the flag). In case you do agree to participate, your vote needs to be added to [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_permissions#Thenub314.C2.A0.28talk.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0email.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0contribs.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0logs.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0rights.29_.28CheckUser.29|administrator Thenub314 request for permission]].

I'm trying to contribute to a maths book too, among other things: [[Geometry for Elementary School]]. I'm in form one (and will be in form two in September), so I think it's what the Americans call 'middle school'. Anyways, I was wondering if you could help contribute to the book, which covers very simple mathematics. Thanks!

==L'Hopital's Rule==

Occasionally, one comes across a limit which results in &lt;math&gt;\frac{0}{0}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\frac{\infty}{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;, which are called indeterminate limits.  However, it is still possible to solve these in many cases due to L'Hôpital's rule. This rule also is vital in explaining how a number of other limits can be derived.

{{Calculus/Def
|title= Definition: Indeterminate Limit
|text=
If &lt;math&gt;\frac{f(c)}{g(c)}&lt;/math&gt; exists, where &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c}f(c)=\lim_{x \to c}g(c)=0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c}f(c)=\lim_{x \to c}g(c)=\infty&lt;/math&gt;, the limit &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be indeterminate.
}}

All of the following expressions are indeterminate forms.

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{0}{0}, \frac{\pm \infin}{\pm \infin}, \infty - \infty, 0 \cdot \infin, 0^0, \infty^0, 1^\infin \ &lt;/math&gt;

These expressions are called ''indeterminate'' because you cannot determine their exact value in the indeterminate form.  Depending on the situation, each indeterminate form could evaluate to a variety of values.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;

===Theorem===

If &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \ &lt;/math&gt; is indeterminate of type 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{0}{0}&lt;/math&gt; or 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{\pm \infty}{\pm \infty}&lt;/math&gt;,

then &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} &lt;/math&gt;

In other words, if the limit of the function is indeterminate, the limit equals the derivative of the top over the derivative of the bottom.  If ''that'' is indeterminate, L'Hôpital's rule can be used again until the limit isn't &lt;math&gt;\frac{0}{0}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\frac{\infty}{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Note:'''

&lt;math&gt; x \ &lt;/math&gt; can approach a finite value ''c'', &lt;math&gt; \infin &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; -\infin &lt;/math&gt;.


&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Proof of the 0/0 case===
Suppose that for real functions &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}f(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}g(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;  and that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}&lt;/math&gt;  exists. Thus &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;g'(x)&lt;/math&gt;  exist in an interval &lt;math&gt;(c-\delta,c+\delta)&lt;/math&gt;  around &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; , but maybe not at &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;  itself. This implies that both &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;  are differentiable (and thus continuous) everywhere in &lt;math&gt;(c-\delta,c+\delta)&lt;/math&gt;  except perhaps at &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, for any &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;  in &lt;math&gt;(c-\delta,c+\delta)&lt;/math&gt; , in any interval &lt;math&gt;[c,x]&lt;/math&gt;  or &lt;math&gt;[x,c]&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;  are continuous and differentiable, with the possible exception of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; . Define&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;F(x)=\left\{\begin{matrix}f(x),&amp;\mbox{if }x\ne c\\ \lim_{x\to c}f(x),&amp;\mbox{if }x=c\end{matrix}\right.&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;G(x)=\left\{\begin{matrix}g(x),&amp;\mbox{if }x\ne c\\ \lim_{x\to c}g(x),&amp;\mbox{if }x=c\end{matrix}\right.&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
Note that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\lim_{x\to c}\frac{F(x)}{G(x)}&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}=\lim_{x\to c}\frac{F'(x)}{G'(x)}&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;F(x)&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;G(x)&lt;/math&gt;  are continuous in any interval &lt;math&gt;[c,x]&lt;/math&gt;  or &lt;math&gt;[x,c]&lt;/math&gt;  and differentiable in any interval &lt;math&gt;(c,x)&lt;/math&gt;  or &lt;math&gt;(x,c)&lt;/math&gt;  when &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;  is in &lt;math&gt;(c-\delta,c+\delta)&lt;/math&gt;.  Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem tells us that &lt;math&gt;\frac{F(x)-F(c)}{G(x)-G(c)}=\frac{F'(\xi)}{G'(\xi)}&lt;/math&gt;  for some &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;  in &lt;math&gt;(c,x)&lt;/math&gt;  (if &lt;math&gt;x&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; ) or &lt;math&gt;(x,c)&lt;/math&gt;  (if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;c&lt;/math&gt; ). Since &lt;math&gt;F(c)=G(c)=0&lt;/math&gt; , we have &lt;math&gt;\frac{F(x)}{G(x)}=\frac{F'(\xi)}{G'(\xi)}&lt;/math&gt;  for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;  in &lt;math&gt;(c-\delta,c+\delta)&lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}\frac{F'(\xi)}{G'(\xi)}&lt;/math&gt;  is the same limit as &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}\frac{F'(x)}{G'(x)}&lt;/math&gt;  since both &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;  are being squeezed to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; . So taking the limit as &lt;math&gt;x\to c&lt;/math&gt;  of the last equation gives &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}\frac{F(x)}{G(x)}=\lim_{x\to c}\frac{F'(x)}{G'(x)}&lt;/math&gt;  which is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\lim_{x\to c}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
===Example 1===
Find &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0}\frac{\sin x}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

Since plugging in 0 for x results in &lt;math&gt;\frac{0}{0}&lt;/math&gt;, use L'Hôpital's rule to take the derivative of the top and bottom, giving:

&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0}\frac{\cos x}{1}&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging in 0 for x gives 1 here.

===Example 2===
Find &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0}x \cot x&lt;/math&gt;

First, you need to rewrite the function into an indeterminate limit fraction:

&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0}\frac{x}{\tan x}&lt;/math&gt;

Now it's indeterminate.  Take the derivative of the top and bottom:

&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0}\frac{1}{\sec^{2} x}&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging in 0 for x once again gives one.

===Example 3===
Find &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{4x+22}{5x+9}&lt;/math&gt;

This time, plugging in &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; for x gives you &lt;math&gt;\frac{\infty}{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;.  You know the drill:

&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{4}{5}&lt;/math&gt;

This time, though, there is no x term left!  &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{5}&lt;/math&gt; is the answer.

===Example 4===

Sometimes, forms exist where it is not intuitively obvious how to solve them. One might think the value &lt;math&gt; 1^\infin = 1 .&lt;/math&gt; However, as was noted in the definition of an indeterminate form, this isn't possible to evaluate using the rules learned before now, and we need to use L'Hôpital's rule to solve.

Find &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to \infin} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{x} \right) ^ x &lt;/math&gt;

Plugging the value of ''x'' into the limit yields

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to \infin} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{x} \right) ^ x = 1^\infin &lt;/math&gt; (indeterminate form).

Let &lt;math&gt; k = \lim_{x \to \infin} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{x} \right) ^ x = 1^\infin &lt;/math&gt;

:{|
|&lt;math&gt; \ln k \, &lt;/math&gt;
|=
|&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to \infin} \ln \left( 1 + \frac{1}{x} \right) ^ x &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|=
|&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to \infin} x \ln \left( 1 + \frac{1}{x} \right) &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|=
|&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to \infin} \frac{\ln \left( 1 + \frac{1}{x} \right)}{\frac{1}{x}} = \frac{\ln 1}{\frac{1}{x}} = \frac{0}{0}&lt;/math&gt; (indeterminate form)
|-
|
|}

We now apply L'Hôpital's rule by taking the derivative of the top and bottom with respect to ''x''.

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} \left[ \ln \left( 1 + \frac{1}{x} \right) \right] = \frac{x}{x+1} \cdot \frac{-1}{x^2} = \frac{-1}{x(x+1)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{-1}{x^2} &lt;/math&gt;

Returning to the expression above

:{|
|&lt;math&gt; \ln k \ &lt;/math&gt;
|=
|&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to \infin} \frac{-(-x^2)}{x(x+1)} &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|=
|&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to \infin} \frac{x}{x+1} = \frac{\infin}{\infin} &lt;/math&gt; (indeterminate form)
|-
|
|}

We apply L'Hôpital's rule once again

:&lt;math&gt; \ln k = \lim_{x \to \infin} \frac{1}{1} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore

:&lt;math&gt; k = e \ &lt;/math&gt;

And

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to \infin} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{x} \right) ^x = e \ne 1 &lt;/math&gt;

Careful: this does not prove that &lt;math&gt; 1^\infin = e \ &lt;/math&gt; because

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to \infin} \left( 1 + \frac{2}{x} \right) ^x = 1^\infin \ne e&lt;/math&gt;

This tutorial is about using guide images to place vertices in their proper places in 3D space.  The second tutorial is on how to take good reference pictures.  This tutorial assumes that you have completed all previous tutorials.

This tutorial describes the use of the ''background image'' feature of Blender to assist in creating models of 3D objects. The background image provides a reference for the dimensions of the object, similar to the way the floor plan and elevation views of a house provide dimension information for the actual house. Guide images are not rendered, and may be removed after the model is completed, or they may be retained as part of the internal documentation of the model. Background images are not generally useful for other &quot;image&quot; purposes such as materials, textures, and actual background images in a scene, just as a floor plan is not actually visible after a house is constructed. 

== Background: orthographic projection ==
[[File:first angle projecting.png|right|300px|orthographic projections in six directions]]
'''[[w:Multiview orthographic projection|orthographic projection]]''' is a technique used by architects and engineers to describe a three-dimensional object by the use of several two-dimensional images, or &quot;projections.&quot; In architecture, the projection as seen from above is called the &quot;plan view&quot; or &quot;floor plan,&quot; the projection as seen from the front is called the &quot;front elevation,&quot; and the projection as seen from the right side is called the &quot;right elevation.&quot; Orthographic projections are intended to assist builders in creating an actual 3D object. 

A Blender user also wants to create a 3D object, in this case a model. Blender provides a way to use a set of one or more orthographic projections as a guide for object creation. Because the images are conceptually &quot;behind&quot; the object from the appropriate point of view, Blender calls these 2D images ''background images''.

Each background image is located &quot;at infinity&quot; in an orthographic view, and there may be one image in each direction: back, front, top, bottom, left, and right. we can use one or more background images to assist our modeling effort.

For example, to model a house, we can put the &quot;floor plan&quot; on the bottom, and build the house above it. We put the front elevation image on the back background, and build the house in front of it. We put the right elevation image on the left background, and build the house to the right of it. The background images can be diagrams such as floor plans, or they can be photographs of an object taken from sufficiently far away to provide undistorted dimensional information.

Reasonably enough, an orthographic projection is only useful in Blender when in orthographic mode. Blender enforces this to prevent you from making mistakes: the orthographic image is only displayed in the background when you are in the orthographic view mode.

== Making a Simple Pyramid ==
[[File:BlenderMakePyramid.png|right|300px]]
First we are going to create a pyramid the easy way.  Then we are going to show how to use different viewpoints and images as a guide to place vertices correctly in 3D space.

Get rid of the default cube. Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|SPACE}} and select Add→Mesh→Cone. Set the number of vertices to 4, and unselect Cap End. Click OK. There’s your pyramid.


'''Note:''' Do not render this looking up from the bottom, as it will appear invisible, as the interior faces of models  are ignored by most rendering engines.




{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.69}}
[[File:Add cone.png|right|100px|Blender screenshot of ADD CONE function]]
In later versions (not sure when it changed) {{B3D:N2P/Do|SPACE}} brings up a vastly longer menu.  The way to ADD something is {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|A}} then choose MESH &gt; CONE.  Then press {{B3D:N2P/Do|T}} to open the tool panel and in the bottom part you will find &quot;Vertices&quot;, set to 4, and &quot;Base Fill Type&quot; set to NOTHING.


=== Save the top vertex for later steps ===
Enter Edit mode ({{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}}). First, unselect all the vertices by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|AKEY}}.  Next, select the bottom four vertices of the pyramid and delete them with {{B3D:N2P/Do|DEL}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|XKEY}}.  The only vertex left will be the vertex which makes the tip of the pyramid.  This will be used later.

{{Clear}}

== Using the guide images ==
Now that we have the pyramid the easy way, let's learn how to use guide images as references to build models.  


=== Window Layout ===
[[File:Blender3d view name setting location.jpg|right|300px]]
To make things easier, open [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/User Preferences Windows|a user preferences window]] and in the &quot;View &amp; Controls&quot; sub-menu, turn on the &quot;View Name&quot; option. The window names will be used for reference inside the rest of this tutorial.

Split the Main 3D view window in to 4 windows. 
:'''Reminder''': to split windows, move the mouse to the border of the view, when the cursor transforms into arrow, right-click and choose &quot;Split Area&quot;. (Explained in the guide: [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Blender Windowing System#Splitting Windows|Noob to Pro/Blender Windowing System]].)
&lt;br /&gt;
Change the point of view in each window so that they end up like this:
:{| border=1 width=&quot;30%&quot; 
|- align=center
| '''NUM1''' || '''NUM7'''
|- align=center
| '''NUM3''' || '''NUM0'''
|}

And if you click on View, you can see that these windows are respectively:
:{| border=1 width=&quot;30%&quot; 
|- align=center
| ''Front'' || ''Top''
|- align=center

By knowing which view you are looking at you may find that you quickly get the idea of what you are doing and can proceed somewhat intuitively in this section on your own without following all of the step by step instructions.

=== Guide images ===
Now, we need some images. These come from a source outside of blender. For this tutorial, we need a floor plan of our pyramid, a front elevation view, and a side elevation view. The floor plan of our pyramid is a square, and the front elevation view is a triangle, as is the side elevation. We will cheat and use the same source image for both the front and side elevation. We can make a picture of a white square and of a white triangle in the GIMP, Paint :) , or some other image editor. or we can find appropriate images somewhere.

==== Method 1 download and use ====
[[File:trianglexemplar.png|frame|Save the triangle with a black background]]
Download the black and white triangle image  on the right of the screen and use that. This image is, minus the checker pattern at the border, 198 x 198. (click it once to get the larger version, right click on the larger one, and save)

{{Clear}}

==== Method 2 roll your own ====
[[File:squaretriangle.png|frame|The square and triangle relationship]]

'''Noob note''' Make sure that the ''drawing'' of the square is ''square'' and not just rectangular. Make the triangle the same width and height as the square. Make sure the apex of the triangle is directly above the midpoint of its baseline. 

===== Specific instructions for Photoshop =====
Make a square selection of &quot;n by n&quot; size, remember the value of &quot;n&quot;. Fill it with white color and save. To create a triangle of needed properties make a rectangular selection of same (n by n) size, on a new layer, click '''RMB''' on your document, choose &quot;Transform selection&quot; option in the pop-up menu. Once you are in &quot;Transform selection&quot; mode, right-click the blank image again. This time the pop-up menu would be different. Choose &quot;Perspective&quot; from it, and with '''LMB''' drag one of the two top vertices toward the other. Once the vertices meet (in the top-center of the image), exit the transformation mode, and fill the resulting triangular selection with white.

Save the files to a place that is easy to access. Blender only supports the TGA, PNG, and JPG image formats.

===== Specific instructions for Gimp =====
Turn on the grid (View-&gt;Show Grid, View-&gt;Snap to Grid), use the rectangle select with a fixed aspect ratio of 1:1 (in the tool options panel) to select a square that you can flood fill. For the triangle, use the node tool to draw a triangular path, convert to selection (Select-&gt;From Path) and fill it. Or you could just use Inkscape...

Save the files to a place that is easy to access. Blender only supports the TGA, PNG, and JPG image formats.

=== Background Images ===
[[File:Importing_Image.jpg|right|300px]]
Load the white square (the floor plan) into the '''top (NUM7)''' window by going to the 3D view window and pressing ''View'' → ''Background image'' → (click on the icon of a file). Find your file and click &quot;select image&quot;. Since you are placing the background while looking at the view from the top, the background is placed infinitely far away at the bottom of the model, which is where we want it.


-''I have a more recent version of blender, and this method does not work. when I hit &quot;view&quot;. Instead, press &quot;View&quot; → &quot;View Properties.&quot; In the Properties menu that now appears check the Background Image checkbox and select an image to use by expanding the Background Images submenu and pressing &quot;Add Image.&quot;


[[File:Blender 2.6 Background images.png|right|300px]]
-''I have Blender 2.6, and &quot;View Properties&quot; doesn't appear, instead, on the right there's a sidebar (Usually hidden, you can clic on the + symbol to view it or hit (NKEY)). You only have to find &quot;background image&quot; and tick on it, you will see below a button to choose an image, and there's also another one, called &quot;Axis&quot;, were you can select were the image should be seen (It should say: All views).


Load the white triangle (the front elevation view) into the '''front (NUM1)''' view window: this places it infinitely far &quot;behind&quot; the model. Similarly, load the right elevation (coincidentally, the same triangle image in this special case) from the right side view '''side (right or NUM3)''' window, to place it infinitely far to the left.

If necessary, zoom out so that you can see the whole background image in each view. 

Now you have now placed your guide images for making your pyramid.

'''Note:''' for each view, if you can not see the picture, switch to Ortho view by hitting NUM5  You won't see it in top view till you do this. Furthermore, the entire idea of using guide images is based on using the orthographic projection, because in the orthographic projection, points on the same line normal to the viewing plane appear at the same point on the view.

{{clear}}

=== Side One ===
[[File:1st_vertex.jpg|right|400px]]
The vertex that is left will be the topmost point of the pyramid.  Use the '''GKEY''' to move the vertex around.  To get it in the right spot, line it up at the top most point in the '''front (NUM1)''' and '''side (right or NUM3)''' windows.  If you look in the '''top (NUM7)''' window the vertex should appear to be in the center.  Make sure to keep the vertex highlighted for the next step.

'''Note:''' If you deleted all of your mesh objects in Object Mode (including the remaining vertex), then you'll be stuck in Object Mode. You can however, add a new mesh object as a base, or an empty mesh via a python script (''Add'' → ''Mesh'' → ''Empty Mesh'') [Blender 2.49]. Once an empty mesh object has been created, select it (right click on it or '''AKEY'''), and then change to the Edit Mode. Now you can begin to create individual vertices with '''CTRL + LMB'''.

'''Note:''' it might be helpful at some point to zoom in and use the X,Y and Z movement restriction)  


{{Clear}}

[[File:1st_line.jpg|right|400px]]

Now, we are going to place more vertices in the scene.  Since we want to have the new vertices connected to the first one, we will make sure the first vertex is selected and hold down '''CTRL''' and click '''LMB''' to create a new one.  

In the '''side (right or NUM3)''' window, place a vertex on the lower left edge of the triangle by holding '''CTRL''' and clicking there.  This should create a line between your 2 points.  If needed, use '''GKEY''' to line it up in that window and also at the lower right point in the '''top (NUM7)''' window.

'''Noob Note:''' if you wind up in the middle of square (top view) then move your new vertex around with '''GKEY''' till it's in the right place in the front, side, and top views

{{Clear}}


[[File:1st_face.jpg|right|400px]]
Next, with only one of the vertices selected, in the '''front (NUM1)''' window place a vertex on the lower left edge of the triangle using the same method.  Line it up in that window and at the lower left point in the '''top (NUM7)''' window.

Now, select your 3 vertices (use '''AKEY''') in the '''front (NUM1)''' window and press the '''FKEY'''.  You should see a triangle appear.

{{Clear}}

=== Side Two ===
Press '''AKEY''' to deselect all vertices and select the vertex at the top of the pyramid again.  Repeat the process from Side One to make the next side.  Place a vertex in each of the other corners of the square using '''CTRL''' and '''LMB'''.  Line them up in two different views with the corners of the triangle and square.  Make sure only the top vertex and the two new vertices are selected and press '''FKEY'''.  This will fill in a face opposite of the first face in the pyramid.

[[File:sidetwo.jpg]]

=== Sides Three and Four ===
To fill in the other two sides, select the top vertex and the two corner vertices on a side where there is no face yet.  Again, use '''FKEY''' to fill in a face.  Repeat this for the last side to have all four sides created.

=== Bottom ===
[[File:Finished%21.jpg|right|selecting all 4 corners]]
In the '''top (NUM7)''' window, select all four corners and make a face.  You should have a solid pyramid! Now, select all 4 faces, hit '''XKEY''', and choose &quot;faces&quot;.{{Clr}}

[[File:Vedhmi.jpg|thumb|right|250px]]
'''Puran Poli''' or '''Vedhmi''' is a Sweet version of stuffed [[Cookbook:Chapati|chapati]] from the Gujarat in the Indian subcontinent. It is mainly stuffed with [[Cookbook:Pigeon Pea|toor dal]] but some people uses [[Cookbook:Chickpea|chana dal]] also.

==Ingredients==
*1/2&amp;nbsp;kg maida
*1/2&amp;nbsp;kg toor dal
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]] powder
*1 tsp ghee
*1/2&amp;nbsp;kg [[Cookbook:Jaggery|jaggery]]
*100 ml oil
* Salt to taste.

 
==Procedure==
#Wash and boil the toor dal with water and 1/2 tsp salt till it becomes soft.
#Cool slightly and strain the dal using a strainer.
#Add cardamom powder and Jaggery and grind to make fine paste. If the paste is sticky, keep it on fire to dry up completely. This is known as &quot;puran&quot;. 
#Knead 1/2&amp;nbsp;kg maida with water and 1/2 tsp salt. Do not make it hard. 
#Add oil and knead the maida again till oil gets absorbed. 
#Prepare equal number of balls from maida and puran. 
#Roll out maida balls to make small un-cooked chapati.
#Stuff these uncooked chapati with &quot;Puran&quot; ball. 
#Roll them again into stuffed chapati just like stuffed paratha. It is called &quot;Poli&quot;.
#Heat a griddle and roast each &quot;Poli&quot;. 
#Apply ghee on both sides when done.

Vedhmi or Puran Poli is now ready to serve.

: The lower section is a rectangular frame with piano key-like projections at right and a serial number reading down. Inside the frame is the mailer's identification and/or the meter number. 
:  Meter numbers all have “A” prefix. Meters known are A1, A3-11, A15-16, A18-19, A23, A25-27, A30, and A32.

'''NOTES''':
* In July 1923 Bafra, Anker and Furtwängler merged into a new company called Francotyp which produced meters under that name starting in 1924.
* Proofs similar to Type A3C exist from before the merger when the manufacturer was still identified as Anker. The stamp differs from A3C by having meter number &quot;C1&quot; below the mailer's identification. The stamp (shown at right) was never used on actual mail in this format.

In early 1923 Erich Komusin prepared a range of postage meters for testing. These were the first multi-value (MV) meters, i.e. they could print any postage value from 0001 to 9999. These machines were not officially sanctioned or approved by the German postal authorities and so are considered essays. However during the test period, which ran from January to at least October 1923, some franked mail, probably with the cooperation of the Hamburg postmaster, was posted by Komusin's manufacturer Guhl &amp; Co. to themselves. At least two mailed covers are known to survive. The stamp from one of the mailed covers is shown at right and is postmarked 15 January 1923. The other was mailed on 10 September 1923. The stamps are versions '''B''' and '''J''' respectively. Other versions may also have been used unofficially on actual mail.

The stamps are similar to Type A4 with octagonal die inscribed “DEUTSCHES REICH” at top but instead of parallel lines they have a currency indicator at the bottom. The meter number is either below the frank or vertical at right, and the (proposed?) mailer's identity is at left with a six-digit impression counter number reading down at far left. Instead of a mailer's identification sub-variety '''B''' has wavy lines at both left and right and may have been a continuous design.

The value of a proof is perhaps $250-300. The value of one of the mailed covers is uncertain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{history of Hong Kong|about=123}}
The first thing you will see when you walk into the Hong Kong Museum of History is a few old rocks. They look neat, sure, but they are not our focus here. This book is about the history of Hong Kong, from the earliest time that Hong Kong ape-people were known to exist – which is about 4000BC. Those people wore made houses, tools and even the odd earring.

When does the book end? Um, no. It ''never'' ends. The moment you began reading the first word of this page is already 'history'. This book attempts to cover every last moment of history that is noteworthy enough. If the current Chief Executive suddenly survives an assassination attempt, yes, we ''will'' include it here, although maybe not as fast as our sister projects, ''Wikinews'' and ''Wikipedia'', do.

Yet, this book, at the same time, aims to be as brief as possible. This is because if we allow this book to grow, and grow, and grow, eventually it will be so big that even a supercomputer cannot load its print version.

Before we embark on our journey to explore (briefly) the history of this city, let us make sure we know what this book is about, its scope and, most importantly, how to contribute to it.

== The wiki ==
First, it must be noted that this book is hosted on ''Wikibooks'', a collection of non-fiction books, mostly textbooks, that is written by the community. For the convenience of those who are reading this in a printed copy, the URL of this book is at &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/History_of_Hong_Kong&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. ''Wikibooks'' consists of two terms: ''wiki'', and ''books''. The latter, as we have seen just now, means that it is a collection of books. But what about the former?

A wiki is a website that allows anyone to add, remove or edit its contents. Such includes the famous ''Wikipedia'', which is our sister project as well as the largest wiki in the Internet, so large that it is sometimes mistaken for the soul wiki. As the 'sum of all human knowledge', Wikipedia can work as a reference tool for the readers. For this reason, readers are advised to look up Wikipedia while reading this book, and this book will also provide links to Wikipedia for further information where necessary.

Since this is a wiki, it means that you can contribute to it. A common guideline in wikis is that users must be bold. That means if you find a fault with the book, you should correct it yourself, rather than contacting the 'authors' and asking them to do it for you. In fact, you can become an 'author' yourself, simply by clicking on the 'edit' tab on top of this page and making a constructive edit to it. For those who are unfamiliar with wikis, try it now. If you are reading this offline, go online to the URL on provided earlier, and click on 'Introduction'. On the left-hand side of 'The wiki', there is a button which reads, [&lt;font color = &quot;blue&quot;&gt;edit&lt;/font&gt;]. Click on it, and edit this section.
&lt;!-- Add something below this line.

Add something above this line.--&gt;

That's it. You have edited this page. It's that easy.

Before you get too excited though, remember that you are also bound by a set of restrictions, or guidelines, while editing. Mind you, this book, like any other part of the ''Wikibooks'' project, is '''not a bureaucracy'''. You are always welcome to contribute to the book without adhering to the guidelines so long as you think it will improve the book. This is not to say that your fellow contributors will not find it unconstructive and undo your edit!

== Guidelines ==
First off, all contents of this book follow the requirements stated at [[WB:PAG|this page]]. (For those reading it offline, the URL is at &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Remember to observe those rules at all times. However, such rules are subject to change at any time. If you feel that a rule is not constructive to the project, you may ask for it to be modified in our [[WB:RR|reading room]] (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Reading room&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

In addition to the ''Wikibooks'' general rules, there are several other guidelines that should be observed where possible. Such guidelines are limited to this book only and may not apply to other books.

=== Content guidelines ===
All content added to the ''History of Hong Kong'' must be verifiable. That means it has to be published in reliable sources before. If it is something you discovered, then chances are it is not suitable for this book, because that constitutes ''original research''. Instead, publish your discovery on some reliable source first. Then you may add it here, although this is still discouraged as you have a conflict of interest.

In order to prove that you did not breach the above guideline, we ask that you provide a reference for every fact you add. Sources that we do not, in general, accept include:
#Internet TV channels or radio stations without a reputation for accuracy;
#Primary sources;
#Sources published by the person or organisation in question, as it is likely biased (government sources generally do NOT count);
#Gossip magazines.

A '''primary source''' is a source that is the actual thing we are trying to study. For example, if we want to study the Qin Dynasty, the institutions set by Qin Shihuangdi is a primary source. The book written by Sima Qian during the Han Dynasty, ''Records of the Grand Historian'' or ''Shiji'', is a '''secondary source''', which is encouraged. Multiple sources are encouraged in order to ensure a neutral point of view.

Another point to note while contributing to this book is that what you add must be notable.Ask yourself, before adding a fact: will anyone who wants to start their studies on the history of Hong Kong and not explore the trivial, no matter how interesting, bother to read it? If the answer is no, then it probably won't be suitable for this book. If in doubt, try to drop a note at the page's talk page, which is accessible by clicking on the 'discussion' tab on the very top of the page. Or, boldly add it. If an experienced contributor thinks it is not acceptable, he or she will undo that edit and put a note on your user talk page. (If you are reading this as an ebook, you can find your user talk page by clicking [[Special:MyTalk|here]].)

Exercises are encouraged. You can add an exercise at the bottom of any page. First, click on the 'edit this page' tab on top of the page. Next, add the following code right above the line which reads &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{BookCat}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;quiz display=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{Question 1&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;|type=&quot;[]&quot;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;+ Choice 1 (correct choice)&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;||&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Explanation for Choice 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;- Choice 2&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;||&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;Explanation for Choice 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;- Choice 3&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;||&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;Explanation for Choice 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;- Choice 4&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;||&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;Explanation for Choice 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/quiz&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Which produces:

{{hiddenh2|Exercise}}
&lt;quiz display=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
{Question 1
|type=&quot;[]&quot;}
+ Choice 1 (correct choice)
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Explanation for Choice 1&lt;/span&gt;
- Choice 2
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;Explanation for Choice 2&lt;/span&gt;
- Choice 3
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;Explanation for Choice 3&lt;/span&gt;
- Choice 4
||&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;Explanation for Choice 4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/quiz&gt;


An extra piece of advice before we go on. Write more on recent events than on ancient ones. This is the way most books are formatted, after all.

=== Style guidelines ===
Note that these guidelines only reflect common practice, which may shift over time.

Endashes (like this: —) should be used instead of hyphens (like this: -) when used to add information. When citing dates, format the date as follows: {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}. When in doubt, consult Wikipedia's general [[w:WP:MOS|manual of style]], although some Wikipedia-specific guidelines may not be suitable for this book. Use common sense and don't be afraid to make mistakes; they will be corrected soon enough.

Important keywords, persons, events, etc., must be in boldface (such as '''Chris Patten''', the '''Opium War''' and '''Legislative Council''') and must be included in [[../Index|the index]]. Guidelines on the index will be provided on that page. If you come across a word that is Chinese (such as ''Dai Pai Dong'') or a word that may be difficult for the general audience, then the word must be in italics and added to [[../Glossary|the glossary]]. A word can be both boldface and italics, and added to both the glossary and the index.

Footnotes are appended to the end of each chapter, under the 'notes' section. They are added to the end of each phrase or sentence within &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags. Put the code &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{reflist}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the 'notes' section for it to show. They should be avoided where the use of round or square brackets will not affect the flow of the passage. Reign-names should be in footnotes. Ref groups should be avoided.

{{Wikipedia|Page for further information}}
Avoid inline citations where necessary, as may create unnecessary trouble for those who are unfamiliar with it. Instead, list out all the references in[[../Bibliography| the Bibliography]]. All references are to be cited using the citation templates. The most commonly used ones are {{tl|cite news}}, {{tl|cite web}} and {{tl|cite book}}. External links or further reading lists not used as references should be avoided where possible. However, links to Wikipedia for further information is encouraged and can be added with the following code: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Wikipedia|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''&lt;nowiki&gt;Page for further information&lt;/nowiki&gt;''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This produces the box on the right.

All pages of this book are to be included in [[:Category:History of Hong Kong|our category]], which can be done by adding {{tl|BookCat}} at the end of each page.

As a general rule, add the Chinese translation of words that are included in the index, although sometimes words do not need to be translated (e.g. Cantonese, whose meaning the reader probably knows already.)

Before writing, it is advised that if you are unfamiliar with MediaWiki, take the [[w:Wikipedia:Tutorial|Wikipedia tutorial]] on Wiki markup in order to learn code that will help you format your writing. Remember to be bold nonetheless; mistakes will be corrected at the blink of an eye!

Please use the most common romanisation. For instance, Tsim Sha Tsui should be used instead of Tsimshatsui. Where no English source exists or can be found about a proper noun, you can either romanise it in pinyin, jyutping or other means. For example, if someone's called 陳小明, and there's someone called 陳大文 and 王小明, whose romanisations are Chan Tai Man and Wong Siu Ming, you can conclude that 陳小明's romanisation is Chan Siu Ming). If you cannot find such 'equivalents', see where he's from - if he's from the city, you can call him Chan Siu Ming; if he's from the mainland before the age of pinyin but after the Chinese Revolution, you can use Wade-Giles; if he's from the mainland before the Revolution or after pinyin was invented, you can use pinyin.

=== Consensus ===
If another editor disagrees with an edit you make, try not to revert it back unless it is blatantly unproductive, such as vandalism, bias, or spam. Instead, leave a note at the page's talk page and also inform the user on his or her user talk page. That way, you can discuss and reach a compromise. If you and the other editor have a dispute you would like to solve, you can seek mediation at our [[WB:PROJECTS|projects reading room]].

Remember that although collaboration is needed, boldness should not be overlooked. If you think something is wrong, just correct it yourself. If that change is really big, you may optionally leave a message on the discussion page explaining the change. Remember to sign your posts with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;) at the end which produces your signature at the GMT time when it was posted.

If you feel that content guideline on this page is faulty, feel free to leave a note on the main talk page of this book at [[Talk:History of Hong Kong]]. If there is no reasonable opposition within 7 days, then you can change it yourself. If it is a style issue that you have noticed the book is no longer adhering to, simply remove it yourself. If another editor disagrees with you, however, he or she ''may'' change it back.

=== Using this book ===
The most obvious way of using this book is reading it! Online or printed, you are free to read it anytime. But what if you think it's cool and want to print it out for your friends? You are most free to do so, although it is encouraged that you download and print the PDF version, since the print version doesn't look as good and takes long to load. Both versions are currently unavailable, though.

Can you use it for commercial purposes? Yes, you can! This book is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike Unported Licence, or CC-BY-SA for short. That means you can distribute and modify it in any way you want as long as you attribute the book to ''Wikibooks'' and share it under the same licence, CC-BY-SA.

== Definitions ==
Defining the scope of a book is very important. If you go about writing a book without a clear direction, you will end up heading in all directions, and the book will become a collection of miscellaneous facts, a hundred-thousand-whys kind of book. In order to define the scope of a book, we have to first define its title.

The title of this book, as you should know by now, is ''History of Hong Kong''. What is history? History is the past. Even what happened a moment ago is history, because it is the past. Everything from the big bang, right up until this moment, we call history. But it is impossible to start recording history from the beginning of the universe, right? That's how the second part of the title comes in handy. We are writing about the history of Hong Kong, which couldn't have existed during the Big Bang. The definition of Hong Kong is the piece of land that the British colonists took away from China due to the Opium Wars. This includes '''Hong Kong Island''', '''Kowloon Peninsula''' and the '''New Territories''', including the outlying islands.

Now that we've narrowed it down both in time and location, we need to narrow it further. After all, Hong Kong was made from bits of land from that giant piece of land that started off at the beginning, when Earth was born. No way do we know of history then, for humanity was yet to exist. Therefore, we shall narrow down our topic further: the human history, not the natural history, of Hong Kong.

Now, what aspects of Hong Kong history shall we focus on? Look in any good bookshop in Hong Kong and you'll probably be surprised at the number of books on the shelves about the declared monuments, traditional culture and clan histories of Hong Kong. These are part of Hong Kong's history, but as they're already covered by a number of other sources, let's not put too much effort into those. Instead, let's focus on actual events that happened in Hong Kong. Now, every history book should have more information on recent than prehistoric events, since that's how sources work – ever seen a book about world history that says more about the Battle of Mingtiao than the Second World War? – so we won't be rebellious and go with the tradition.

[[File:Hestia tapestry.jpg|thumb|The Hestia tapestry.]]
Aha! There we are. The topic is still broad, but at least we can manage to write a book on it. So how will we arrange this book? History is often compared to tapestry, a kind of art in which threads are woven together and produce a fine picture. The threads are woven together in a very complicated manner, and it is often difficult to find how exactly the manage to stick together. Therefore, it will be very difficult to cover every thread in history, yet we can try to weave together the main threads, and look at it at a distance in order to perceive the big picture. This is also the reason why it is impossible to arrange the book in chronological order: because events cross so much.

== And now... ==
You have read through the introduction of this book. This means you already know quite a bit about what this book is about. So, read on for a brief overview of Hong Kong's history...

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section defines the style rules that should be applied throughout the [[Abstract Algebra]] wikibook.

== Purpose ==
This is intended as a University-level textbook for students of mathematics. Readers are therefore expected to be familiar with math fundamentals, and with the material in the [[Algebra]] and [[Linear Algebra]] wikibooks.

== Language ==
The style of the language should be that of an ordinary math textbook: clear and precise but without talking down to the reader. Personal comments should be avoided.

The book should use standard American English spelling throughout.

== Structure ==
Each page should read like a section of a paper textbook, with external links to futher reading where appropriate.(?)

== Chapter and section titles ==
For top-level chapter titles, all words should be capitalised apart from articles and prepositions (e.g. &quot;Equivalence Relations and Congruence Classes&quot;). Sub-headings within a page should only have the first letter of the heading capitalised.

== Page length restrictions ==
There are no additional page length restrictions imposed by this style guide, but do follow the global Wikibooks convention of limiting page lengths at 35k (?)

== Templates ==
With the exception of unimportant comments, each paragraph of text should be preceeded with a &quot;type declaration&quot;. Commen types are ''Definition'', ''Theorem'', ''Lemma'', ''Example'', ''Note'' and ''Remark''. A proof should be preceeded with the word &quot;''Proof''&quot; in italics and a semicolon, and ended with a black square: {{Unicode|∎}} . Code: &lt;pre&gt;{{Unicode|∎}}&lt;/pre&gt;

The same counter should be used for all types of paragraphs. Example:

'''Definition 1:''' ...


'''Theorem 2:''' ...

''Proof'': ... {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Remark 3:''' ...

etc...

== Links ==
Don't link outside the book (except in the introduction to the book as a whole, which can link to other books that are prerequisites).

== Navigation ==
There are no navigation templates.

== Images ==
All images should be in Wikimedia commons. Since the vast majority of images will be diagrams to illustrate a point in the surrounding text, thumbnails will probably not be appropriate.

== Categories ==
All book chapters belong under the single category [[:Category:Abstract Algebra|Abstract Algebra]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">I began adding a local manual of style, since given the level of activity on this book I think we should be able to get some of the pages reviewed as 'good' quality, which requires compliance with a local manual of style. I'm intending to go through and set out the requirements in the manual of style based on what we're already doing in the majority of the book, but if anyone has any particular opinions on this I'm very open to suggestions. My aim was to capture what the existing contributors are thinking, not to enforce my own ideas on this. --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|talk]]) 14:47, 19 August 2010 (UTC)

== Relation to [[Abstract Algebra/Groups/Guideline for Editors|Guideline for Editors]]? ==

On [[User:Xerol/Cleanup|orphan patrol]] I came across [[Abstract Algebra/Groups/Guideline for Editors|this page]] which seems to be someone else's attempt at a MoS. The page orphaned (nothing currently links to it) so if that page no longer represents the desired Manual of Style for this book it should probably be deleted. Normally I would post it for speedy deletion but as this page exists I wanted to give the contributors here a chance to weigh in. [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] ([[User talk:Xerol|talk]]) 02:38, 19 November 2010 (UTC)

== Linking outside the book ==

The current guideline discourages linking outside the book. However, I think this should be allowed when suggesting further reading on topics which shouldn't/cannot be directly included due to space, irrelevance to the rest of the book, etc. Any thoughts on this?

{{{text|}}}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;
==Usage==

A simple template for presenting important definitions in the [[Physics with Calculus]] textbook.

It takes two named parameters:

;text
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Physics/Def | text=My definition.}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

;title
:''Optional.'' The title is displayed at the top of the box in bold.
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Physics/Def | title=Theorem | text=My definition.}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The parameters are named because [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Template#Restrictions_on_parameters_and_parameter_values unnamed parameters can't have &quot;=&quot; signs] without some finagling by users of the template.

This is based off of the similar template for the Calculus textbook.

Hope you wouldn't mind participating on the &quot;vote&quot; to restore the [[Wikibooks:Administrators#Becoming_a_CheckUser|CheckUser (CU) function]] (mostly used to fight vandalism) to the Wikibooks project, a &lt;u&gt;minimum of 25 expressions of support is required&lt;/u&gt; to grant the flag to administrator Thenub314 (this will also enable admin Adrignola to get the function active again, since there is a minimum requirement of 2 active Wikibookians with the flag). In case you do agree to participate, your vote needs to be added to [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_permissions#Thenub314.C2.A0.28talk.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0email.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0contribs.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0logs.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0rights.29_.28CheckUser.29|administrator Thenub314 request for permission]]. Thanks.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:46, 19 August 2010 (UTC)

:I actually considered doing so when I visited that page earlier, but since it's only been 4 days yet since the request was made, I thought the community would be able to reach that number with votes from people who know his work better. But given the overwhelming support he's received so far, I have no problems in placing my trust in him. Cheers, [[User:Waldir|Waldir]] ([[User talk:Waldir|talk]]) 17:19, 19 August 2010 (UTC)

::Thanks. The special circumstance here is that it is necessary to reach the minimum number of support and we seem to suffer from not having a community that is active outside of their own projects or beyond their individual requirements.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:33, 19 August 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[21:31]	Xycaleth: i finally understand those blend funcs now :D
[21:31]	Didz: same
[21:31]	BlasTech: alphaGen identity
[21:31]	Yzmo: I still dont..
[21:31]	Didz: try alphaGen const 1.0
[21:31]	Yzmo: Write a guide Xycaleth?
[21:31]	BlasTech: Hmm, maybe. :D
[21:32]	Xycaleth: i can try explaining it here if you want
[21:32]	Yzmo: That'd be great too :)
[21:32]	Xycaleth: the first one is the source function, second is the destination function
[21:32]	Xycaleth: and you have an equation like...
[21:32]	Xycaleth: final_color = source_color * source_func + dest_color * dest_func
[21:32]	Didz sets mode +m
[21:32]	Didz: colour*
[21:32]	ChanServ sets mode -m
[21:32]	Xycaleth: o.0
[21:33]	Xycaleth: you muppet
[21:33]	Xycaleth: anyhow
[21:33]	BlasTech: Same for me. I've actually explained GL_DST_COLOR GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA very thoroughly in the shaders of the latest effects. ;)
[21:33]	Didz sets mode +m
[21:33]	Didz: colour*
[21:33]	ChanServ sets mode -m
[21:33]	Didz: oops
[21:33]	Didz: i'll turn that off
[21:33]	Xycaleth: lol
[21:33]	Didz: done
[21:33]	Xycaleth: so source colour is what is already on the screen
[21:33]	Yzmo: Okay
[21:33]	Didz: other way around
[21:33]	Xycaleth: eh..probably
[21:33]	BlasTech: Actually I am working on realistic water. :D
[21:33]	Xycaleth: destination colour is what is already on the screen
[21:34]	Didz: destination is what is already on the screen
[21:34]	BlasTech: Photosourced. :)
[21:34]	Didz: nice
[21:34]	Xycaleth: source colour is what you're going to be adding on to the screen with some sort of blended thing
[21:34]	Xycaleth: if you have a destination function of GL_ONE, then the red/green/blue components of the destination function are multiplied by 1
[21:35]	Yzmo: aka nothing happens?
[21:35]	BlasTech: Det kommer att vara StorsjÃ¶vatten i JKG. :P
[21:35]	Xycaleth: yus
[21:35]	Xycaleth: then, lets say i set the source function to be GL_ZERO
[21:35]	Xycaleth: so the source colours are multiplied by 0
[21:35]	Yzmo: Jag bor I skåne BlasTech, har ingen aning hur storsjövatten ser ut
[21:35]	BlasTech: Ã„sch. :P
[21:35]	Xycaleth: and you just end up with the destination colours
[21:36]	Xycaleth: everything make sense so far? :D
[21:36]	Yzmo: okay.. But isnt x0 black?
[21:36]	Xycaleth: ya
[21:36]	Xycaleth: but you do src_color * src_func + dest_color * dest_func
[21:36]	Yzmo: right, +
[21:37]	Xycaleth: so, lets say you do something more interesting
[21:37]	Xycaleth: like...destination function of it's alpha channel (GL_DST_ALPHA &lt;-- does it even exist? o_O)
[21:37]	BlasTech: Still not working. :( BTW, how to make the shader not affected by fog? o.o
[21:38]	Xycaleth: no idea o.o
[21:38]	Didz: i forgot
[21:38]	Xycaleth: and then we have source function as (1 - it's own alpha channel)
[21:38]	Didz: yes xyc, it exists afaik
[21:38]	Xycaleth: which would be, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA
[21:38]	Xycaleth: in the end you have something like...
[21:39]	Xycaleth: final_color = src_color * src_alpha + dest_color * (1 - dest_alpha)
[21:39]	Yzmo: ah
[21:39]	Xycaleth: which blends it in some way (i don't know what :D)</text>

      <comment>/* Escape velocity */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Basic Equation==

To establish a basic equation for the gravitational potential energy of a small object above a planet, let us assume that the height displacement, h, is small compared to the radius of the planet involved.  We shall also assume that the potential energy (PE) is 0 at the surface of the planet.  From this, we get:

{{Physics/Def
|title = Definition: Basic Gravitational Potential Energy Equation
|text=
Since energy is force times distance, the potential energy is force times the height distance:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
PE &amp; = F_gh \\
   &amp; = mgh\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where PE is the potential energy, F&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; is the gravitational force, g is the acceleration due to gravity, h is the height difference between the start and finish, and m is the mass of the object being moved.
}}

Since gravity is a conservative force, the potential energy gain or loss is independent of the path taken to get there.

==The Real Equation==

Sometimes, the above equation isn't enough.  Though it is a convenient shortcut when h is much smaller than the planet's radius, there exists an equation which is accurate regardless of the height involved or the change of the acceleration due to gravity.

Suppose an object moves, starting at a distance r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; from the center of a planet and moving to a further distance r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the center of the planet.  The work done by the gravitational force is:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
W_g &amp; = \frac{GMm}{r_2} - \frac{GMm}{r_1}\\
    &amp; = GMm\left(\frac{1}{r_2}-\frac{1}{r_1}\right)\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since potential energy is the opposite of work,


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Delta PE_g &amp; = -W_g \\
            &amp; = -GMm\left(\frac{1}{r_2}-\frac{1}{r_1}\right)\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The change in potential energy can also be written as the potential energy at the start minus the potential energy at the finish.

&lt;math&gt;
PE_2-PE_1 = -GMm\left(\frac{1}{r_2}-\frac{1}{r_1}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

The only possible universal reference point for gravitational potential energy is at infinity.  In other words:


&lt;math&gt;\lim_{r_2 \to \infty}PE_2=0&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the equation simplifies a bit, since 1 over infinity is 0:

{{Physics/Def
|title=Definition: The True Equation for Gravitational Potential Energy
|text=
&lt;math&gt;PE = - \frac{GMm}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is universal, regardless of how long or short the distance is.  However, it is still often more convenient to use the simpler equation, as it requires neither the distance from the object to the core of the planet involved nor the mass of the planet involved.
}}

==Another proof==

Because the gravitational force changes over the displacement in the example above, the work done by this force is a definite integral:

&lt;math&gt;dW = \vec Fdx \Rightarrow W = \int_{r_1}^{r_2}\vec Fdx&lt;/math&gt;

Since the inward gravitational force is the opposite direction of the displacement, we get:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\vec Fdr &amp; = -Fdr \\
         &amp; = -\frac{GMm}{r^2}dr \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Putting that into the original equation:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
W &amp; = \int_{r_2}^{r_1}\vec Fdr \\
  &amp; = \int_{r_2}^{r_1}-\frac{GMm}{r^2}dr \\
  &amp; = GMm\int_{r_2}^{r_1}-\frac{1}{r^2}dr \\
  &amp; = GMm \left [\frac{1}{r} \right ]_{r_2}^{r_1} \\
  &amp; = -GMm\left(\frac{1}{r_2}-\frac{1}{r_1}\right) \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Recognize that last step?  (If not, scroll up slightly)  This leads back to the true equation for Gravitational Potential Energy.

==Escape velocity==

To get an object permanently far away from the Earth, we want the final gravitational potential energy to become zero.  However, to find its minimum launch speed, we want the objects speed when the gravitational potential energy becomes zero to also be zero.  This means that the final kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy should both be zero.  Due to Conservation of Energy:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
KE_0+PE_0 &amp; = KE+PE \\
\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{GM_Em}{r_E} &amp; = 0 + 0 \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Isolating v:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{2}mv^2 &amp; =\frac{GM_Em}{r_E} \\
           mv^2 &amp; =\frac{2GM_Em}{r_E} \\
            v^2 &amp; =\frac{2GM_E}{r_E} \\
              v &amp; =\sqrt{\frac{2GM_E}{r_E}} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

And that's the formula for escape velocity.  Plugging in values for G, M&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;, and r&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
v &amp; = \sqrt{\frac{2(6.67*10^{-11})(5.98*10^{24})}{6.37*10^6}} \\
  &amp; = 1.12*10^4\frac{m}{s} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Index ==

I'll give anyone willing to reorganise the index a barnstar. Here's what's needed to be done.

#Find a word in boldface.
#Search for the word at [[Special:Search/(word) prefix:History of Hong Kong/]].
#Among the results, pick the one that appears earliest in the book. If that one is not bold, make it that way and de-bold the original boldface word.
#List the results at [[History of Hong Kong/Index]]. The template {{tl|index chapter}} was supposed to make this easier, but apparently it's only complicating matters. (Darn it - the template syntax was so complex it took a while to create.)
#Repeat until everything is covered.

They always say that Hong Kong used to be a little town, with farmers and fishermen in every street. That was long, long ago. But what happened before that? Surely those prehistoric Hong Kong people can't do nothing? They would die of boredom, can't they?

Archaeologists have dug up quite a few artefacts to prove that they didn't do nothing. Traces of Neolithic culture have been spotted in many an archaeological site. Tools and other things made from stone and clay are tell-tale signs that they're the people didn't just exist thousands of years ago, but made tools and stuff also. Historians mostly agree that the history of Hong Kong dates back to at least 4000 BC, which is around the beginning of the Metal Age for the rest of the world, but still pretty neolithic for Hong Kong.

== Some terms ==
=== Prehistoric and historic ===
The '''prehistoric times''' refers to the age with no written record, and can only be studied through archaeology (which is hard) or stories passed down from generations (which are unreliable). The '''historic times''' refers to the age after that, with written record. The prehistoric times ended at different times in different places. For Hong Kong, it's around 221–206 BC. The following diagram compares the starting-times of prehistoric times in different places:

[[File:Historic beginning timeline.svg|center|600px]]

The famous Sumerians were the first to cross the historic finishing line. That's what makes Mesopotamia so famous. The managed to invent writing before anyone else did. The second were the Egyptians, the third the Dravidians. It's only legend that Chanjie invented writing during the Yellow Emperor's reign, and the first known oracle script was from the Shang Dynasty, so we say that the Shangs started the prehistoric times of China. Hong Kong was yet to be part of China then, however.

After '''Qin Shihuangdi''' decided to conquer the other lords, he decided he needed more land (like '''Alexander the Great''' and '''Julius Caesar'''). Besides, some of the barbarians of the north had started to disturb the Han people during the Warring States period, so Qin Shihuangdi tried to ward them (the Beidis, since that's what they called the barbarians of the north) off. And he decided he wanted to invade the land of the Nanmans (barbarians of the south) as well. As it turns out, those people are called the Yue people, and he took over Hong Kong while invading Yue lands. As he spread his writing to the South, Hong Kong started its prehistoric times.

=== Stone and Metal Ages ===
The '''Stone''' and '''Metal Ages''', despite the apparent connexions, is not really the same thing as historic/prehistoric, or the dynasties. The Metal Age is simply a time when metals were used in tools rather than stones. This is because metals a stronger and more malleable, amongst other things. The part of the Metal Age when people used bronze is called the ''Bronze Age''; the part when they used copper is the ''Copper Age''; the part when they used iron is the ''Iron Age''.

The Stone Age is divided into three ages: the '''Old Stone Age''' or the '''Paleolithic''', the '''Middle Stone Age''' or the '''Mesolithic''', and the '''New Stone Age''' or the '''Neolithic'''. People built very simple huts and made very simple tools in the Old Stone Age. In the Middle Stone Age, they started living near rivers and fished. In the New Stone Age they starting growing crops and raising livestock and lived in villages with barter systems.

{{wikipedia|Prehistoric Hong Kong}}
You probably know all that already, so when was Hong Kong's Stone Ages? Most agree that there were people living in Hong Kong during the New Stone Age in 4000 BC.

The Metal Age of Hong Kong took place since 1500 BC, around the time of the '''Shang Dynasty''' of China, the one founded by '''Tang of Shang'''. Read on to find out more...

==The original inhabitants of the metropolis==
{{wikipedia|Yao people|Che people|Yue people}}
Two peoples, the Yaos and the Yues, inhabited prehistoric Hong Kong. Both peoples are sinilised in Hong Kong.

The Yao people were originally from Wuling, Hunan, what is now called Changde. Two branches of the Yao people inhabited Guangdong. As Hong Kong is geographically located in Guangdong, the Yao people should have inhabited there, although there is no way of confirming that. There are records of a Yao riot in Lantau Island in the early Southern Song Dynasty, though, which is proof that the Yao had been in Hong Kong.

The Che people were a branch of the Yao people, and inhabited Guangdong. A lot of places in the New Territories have the character 'Che' in their names, such as Ping Che, Wo Che, etc., which means the Che people may have lived there. The stepped terraces they built are called Che fields.

The Yue or Baiyue people also inhabited Hong Kong. Note that names like Yue, Yueman or Baiyue are only collective names. They are not a unified people. The Yue people liked naming places with the character 'tung', meaning 'cave', and many places in Hong Kong end with 'tung'. Some rock carvings in Hong Kong see [[/Stone Age|the Stone Age chapter]] for more on carvings) are of what look like birds, which were worshipped be the Yues.

== The world ==
The rest of the world hadn't been idle while Hong Kong developed its Stone Ages. Here's what happened 4000 BC–200 BC...
*4000 BC: Yangshao people in China are still neolithic. The Sumerians start to get civilised.
*3200 BC: Minos conquers Lower Egypt and unifies Egypt
*3000 BC: Sumerians invent writing, Minoans and Dravidians start to get civilised too.
*2686 BC: The Old Kingdom of Egypt starts
*2040 BC: The Middle Kingdom of Egypt starts
*1500 BC: The Indus Valley civilisation declines
*1450 BC: Mycenians conquer Minoans
*1100 BC: Dorians conquer Mycenians
*800 BC: City-states emerge in Greece
*750 BC: Start of the Spring and Autumn Period of China.
*475 BC: Start of the Warring States Period of China.
*456 BC: Western Roman Empire falls
*323 BC: Alexander died

The Pentium 4 is an out of order processor (http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~patt/10s.382N/handouts/Pentium4.pdf) which might not be the best example of superpipeline, as the architecture as a whole is way more complex than just a deep pipeline.

==Usage==
This template is used as a summary of relevant factual data about a historical event, defined as lasting under one year. It is intended for use in history related pages as the primary infobox and is not intended for use as a summary of a section.

&lt;pre&gt;{{infobox historical event
  |event          = (Event_Name)
  |image          = (Image_Name)
  |size           = (Image size in pixels - default is 220px)
  |alt            = (Alt text for image)
  |caption        = (Image_Caption)
  |time           = (Video thumbnail frame - see below)
  |aka            = (Also known as)
  |participants   = (Participants)
  |location       = (Location)
  |date           = (Date) - use {{Start date|YYYY|MM|DD}} where applicable.
  |result         = (Result)
  |url            = (Website)
}}&lt;/pre&gt;

The alt text is for users who cannot see the image.

For dates, use {{tl|start date}} where applicable, but see that template's documentation for caveats if before 1583.

Thumb_Time supports a parameter for video files if a video is used as the infobox image. Entering a value of &lt;code&gt;{{!}}time = 200&lt;/code&gt; for example will choose the frame at 200 seconds (3 minutes 20 seconds) of video play time as the initial still image displayed, playing the video will start from the beginning regardless of the frame chosen.

&lt;big&gt;'''Vaginal Cancer Overview'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Epidemiology==
*Majority of vaginal neoplasms are metastatic; typically by direct extension (vulva/cervix), lymphatics, or hematogenous spread. 
*According to FIGO staging, if the tumor involves vulva or the cervical os, it is classified as arising from that structure, even if it is centered in vagina 
*Only 10-20% are primary vaginal tumors, and account for ~2% of gynecologic malignancies
*Age: 
**75% in patients &gt;50
**60% in patients &gt;70
*Location PMID 5162136 (1971):
**58% tumors occur on posterior wall
**51% tumors occur in upper 1/3 of vagina
*Approximately 60% have had prior hysterectomy for variety of reasons


==Anatomy==
'''Vaginal Anatomy''' 
*Introitus - vaginal opening
*Hymen - thin tissue membrane concealing vaginal canal. Formed by connection of the urogenital sinus epithelium invaginating inward, with the mullerian ducts descending from above
*Fornices - invaginations between walls of vagina and cervix
*Pouch of Douglas - retrouterine pouch separating vagina from rectum
*Average length 7.5 cm
*Vaginal wall
**Stratified squamous epithelium
**Muscularis layer
**Adventitia

'''Lymphatic drainage of vagina'''
*Complex
*Upper 2/3 of vagina - pelvic nodes (obturator, internal/external iliac)
*Lower 1/3 of vagina - inguinal and pelvic nodes
*5-20% present with clinically positive nodes


*'''Torino, Italy; 2002''' PMID 12210022 -- &quot;Rationale and definition of the lateral extension of the inguinal lymphadenectomy for vulvar cancer derived from an embryological and anatomical study.&quot; (Micheletti L, J Surg Oncol. 2002 Sep;81(1):19-24.)
**Embryological and anatomic study to determine lateral extension of groin lymphadenectomy in vulvar cancer. 3 human fetuses, 1 patient dissected
**Outcome: Most lateral superficial inguinal lymph node does not rise above medial margin of the sartorius muscle, nor far lateral to where superficial circumflex iliac vessels cross the inguinal ligament
**Conclusion: Lateral surgical landmark established

==Risk Factors==
*Approximately 2/3 are HPV-related
*HSV, trichomonas, number of sexual partners &gt;5
*Long term pessary use, smoking, immunosuppression, pelvic radiation
*Maternal use of diethylstilbestrol (DES) during first 4 months ''in utero''

==Associated with prior cervical carcinoma==
*'''U. Michigan, 1982''' - PMID 7095583 (No abstract) [http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/23906/1/0000149.pdf PDF] -- &quot;Neoplasms of the vagina following cervical carcinoma.&quot; (Choo YC, Gynecol Oncol. 1982 Aug;14(1):125-32.)


==Prevention &amp; Screening==
*Insufficient evidence for women s/p TAH
*Pap smear for high-risk populations; continue into older years


==Presentation==
*Abnormal vaginal bleeding in 50-75%, discharge, pruritus
*Dysuria, pelvic pain in more advanced disease


==Work-Up==
*Speculum examination, rotate to observe posterior wall
*Vaginal palpation, bimanual pelvic, rectovaginal for staging
*Evaluate vulva and cervical os for disease - biopsy suspicious lesions
*Evaluate for mets with CXR, CBC, LFTs and alk phos
*Biopsy suspicious inginal nodes
*Stage II or greater consider cystoscopy and/or sigmoidoscopy
*Consider MRI - superior to CT for evaluation of soft tissue extension (though neither may be used in clinical staging)
**Consider dynamic contrast MRI


*'''Manchester; 2007''' (UK)(1996-2005) PMID 17467392 -- &quot;Magnetic resonance imaging of primary vaginal carcinoma.&quot; (Taylor MB, Clin Radiol. 2007 Jun;62(6):549-55.)
**Retrospective. 25 patients with MRI examination. Isointense to muscle on T1, hyperintense on T2
**Outcome: 88% extension beyond vagina, 56% Stage III/IV
**Conclusion: MRI identified &gt;95% tumors, radiological staging correlated with outcome, and provided treatment planning information


==Histology==
*Squamous cell carcinoma (80-90%), primarily in older patients, invade locally with mets to lung and liver
*Melanoma (3-5%), second most common cancer in vagina
*Clear cell carcinoma, particularly in young women with DES exposure ''in utero'' (FDA advised against DES use in 1971 - thus incidence has dropped dramatically)
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Rhabdomyosarcoma|Rhabdomyosarcoma]] (botryoid type) most common in children
*Verrucous carcinoma (rare) - tend to recur locally and rarely metastasize thus surgical approaches may be appropriate PMID 635607


==Prognostic Factors==
*Clinical stage most important
*Adenocarcinoma and non-epithelial tumors (melanoma, sarcoma) worse than squamous cell

&lt;big&gt;'''Vaginal Cancer Treatment'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Overview==
*Primary radiotherapy is considered treatment of choice in most localized vaginal cancer.
**Favorable tumor control 
**Primary radiotherapy consists of external beam radiotherapy +/- brachytherapy boost
**EBRT is typically AP/PA 40-45 Gy, with Brachytherapy boost to 50-80 Gy depending on stage. Inferior border is typically 4cm below most caudad extent of disease (localized with platinum marker). Medial inguinofemoral LN included with distal 1/3 vagina lesions
**Brachytherapy alone may be considered for &lt;2cm, well differentiated lesion, &lt;0.5cm thick
**Radiation typically contraindicated in verrucous carcinoma.
*Primary chemo-RT has been reported by couple institutions, with tolerable toxicity and good control
*Surgical management would include radical hysterectomy, partial vaginectomy, and bilateral lymphadenectomy.
**Surgery worsens functional outcome as compared to radiation.
*5-year survival:

==Primary Radiotherapy==
*'''Indiana University; 2009''' PMID 19509572 -- &quot;Indiana University experience in the management of vaginal cancer.&quot; (Sinha B, Int J Gynecol Cancer. 2009 May;19(4):686-93.)
**Retrospective. 45 patients, treated with RT alone (n=30), chemo-RT (n=9), and surgery + RT (n=6). Median tumor dose 73 Gy. Median F/U 5.8 years
**Outcome: 5-year PFS 77%, OS 71%. 5-year OS by stage: I 92%, II 82%, III/IVA 20%. Only stage predicted for outcome
**Conclusion: Early stage vaginal cancer can be managed with RT; stage III and IV have poor outcome

*'''Munster, Germany; 2009''' (1968-2005) PMID 19330296 -- &quot;Long-term results of radiotherapy in primary carcinoma of the vagina.&quot; (Hegemann S, Strahlenther Onkol. 2009 Mar;185(3):184-9. Epub 2009 Mar 28.)
**Retrospective. 41 patients , treated with RT alone. Pelvic dose 50 Gy, involved inguinal dose 60 Gy, intravaginal BT in 63% to 40 Gy LDR or 42/6 HDR. Stage I 17%, Stage II 32%, Stage III 32%, Stage IV 19%
**Outcome: OS 1-year 85%, 5-years 41%, 10-years 27%. CR in 51%, PR 41%. 
**Toxicity: Acute G3+ 24%, late G3 7% (1 rectovaginal fistula, 1 epithelial necrosis, 1 radiation colitis)
**Conclusion: Definitive RT is the treatment of choice, with reasonable toxicity

**193 patients treated w/ definitive RT.  In general, EBRT 40-45 Gy in 20-25 fx, followed by brachytherapy to deliver a total (including EBRT) 75-80 Gy. 
**Outcome: 85% DSS at 5 yrs for stage I, 78% DSS for stage II, 58% DSS for stage III-IV.  Control in pelvis at 5 yrs - 86% for stage I, 84% for stage II, 71% for stage III-IV.
**Predominant mode of failure was locoregional (68% for stage I-II, 83% stage III-IV); 82% DSS if &lt;4cm, 60% if &gt;4cm.
**Conclusion: Excellent outcome with RT alone; however, therapy must be individualized

***Retrospective. 86 patients. Stage 0-II treated with intravaginal HDR alone (30%), Stage II-IV HDR + EBRT (65%), palliative EBRT in 5%
***Outcome: 5-year OS: Stage 0 83%, Stage I 41%, Stage II 43%, Stage III 37%, Stage IV 0%; DFS 100%, 77%, 50%, 23%, 0%. 
***Toxicity: bladder/rectum &lt;2%, vagina up to 6%
***Conclusion: HDR well tolerated, and effective

***Retrospective. 190 patients, 80 patients with HDR +/- EBRT compared with historical group of 110 LDR +/- EBRT
***Outcome: No difference in OS, local and distant recurrences
***Conclusion: HDR at least similar in outcome, with better delivery

*'''MSKCC Brachytherapy; 1992''' PMID 1429100 -- &quot;The importance of brachytherapy technique in the management of primary carcinoma of the vagina.&quot; (Stock RG, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1992;24(4):747-53.)
**Retrospective. 49 patients treated w/ definitive RT.  Brachy techniques included intracavitary (HDR vag cylinder, LDR T&amp;O, LDR vag cylinder) and interstitial.
**Outcome: 5-year OS Stage I 44%, Stage II 48%, Stage III 40%, Stage IV 0%. Improved OS with additional brachytherapy (50% vs. 9%, SS)
**For stage II and III, trend to improved OS w/ use of interstitial implant (80% vs 45% DFS for stage II, 75% vs 44% DFS for stage III)

**'''1999''' (1953-1991) PMID 10219792 -- &quot;Factors affecting long-term outcome of irradiation in carcinoma of the vagina.&quot; (Perez CA, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1999 Apr 1;44(1):37-45.)
***212 pts (192 invasive, 20 in situ) treated w/ definitive RT. 
***10-yr DFS 94% for Stage 0, 80% for Stage I, 55% for Stage IIA, 35% for Stage IIB, 38% for Stage III, 0% for Stage IV. Distant metastasis 13% Stage I, 30% IIA, 52% IIB, 50% III, and 47% IV. 
***Conclusion: &quot;Radiation therapy is an effective treatment for patients with vaginal carcinoma, particularly Stage I. More effective irradiation techniques, including optimization of dose distribution combining external irradiation and interstitial brachytherapy in tumors beyond Stage I, are necessary to enhance locoregional tumor control. The high incidence of distant metastases emphasizes the need for earlier diagnosis and effective systemic cytotoxic agents to improve survival in these patients.&quot;

***Retrospective. 165 patients treated w/ definitive RT. Stage I generally treated w/ brachy alone (intracavitary or interstitial) w/ 86% local control in pelvis.
***Outcome: 10 yr OS 75% for stage I, 55% for IIA, 43% for IIB, 32% for III.

==Chemo-RT==

**Retrospective. 6 patients (Stage II 2, Stage III 1, Stage IVA 3). Pelvic EBRT 50 Gy, then 2 patients vaginal BT, 4 EBRT boost, total dose 60-66 Gy. Concurrent cisplatin 20 mg/m2 x5d Q3W
**Outcome: 1/2 Stage II patients died of disease at 2 years, 1/1 Stage III patients local failure at 1 year, remaining 4 patients disease-free 1.5-4.5 years later
**Toxicity: 1 vesico-vaginal fistula; no G3-5 toxicity
**Conclusion: Chemo-RT effective and should be considered in high-risk disease

*'''Ontario; 2007''' (1999-2004) PMID 17512130 -- &quot;Primary vaginal cancer treated with concurrent chemoradiation using cis-platinum.&quot; (Samant R, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Nov 1;69(3):746-50.)
**Retrospective. 12 patients, 50% Stage II, 33% Stage III, 17% Stage IVA. Treated with concurrent weekly cisplatin 40mg/m2 + RT (EBRT 45/25 + interstitial/intracavitary BT 30 Gy)
**Outcome: 5-year OS 66%, PFS 75%, LRC 92%
**Conclusion: Concurrent cisplatin+RT feasible, excellent control

*'''UC Davis; 2004''' (1986-1996) PMID 14764038 -- &quot;Chemoradiation for primary invasive squamous carcinoma of the vagina.&quot; (Dalrymple JL, Int J Gynecol Cancer. 2004 Jan-Feb;14(1):110-7.)

**Outcome: OS 65% at median 8.3 years
**Conclusion: Concurrent chemo-RT effective

*'''Princess Margaret; 1995''' (1974-1989) PMID 7705681 -- &quot;Carcinoma of the vagina--experience at the Princess Margaret Hospital (1974-1989).&quot; (Kirkbride P, Gynecol Oncol. 1995 Mar;56(3):435-43.)
**Retrospective. 153 patients, 128 RT, 26 concurrent chemo
**Outcome: 5-year DSS Stage 0 100%, Stage I/II 77%, Stage III/IV 56%
**Toxicity: severe late complication 6%
**Conclusion: RT effective, dose &gt;=70 Gy recommended

==Sequellae of Radiation Therapy==
*Early: External beam radiation to the vagina causes extreme pain and moist desquamation to the entire genital/perineal area.
*Late: Vaginal stenosis/fibrosis (vaginal dilators recommended to minimize), cystitits, proctitis, rectovaginal or vesicovaginal fistula

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

=== Usage ===
This template behaves like {{tl|lang}}, but additionally inserts the &lt;code&gt;dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&lt;/code&gt; parameter in the span, and adds the [[w:Left-to-right mark|&amp;amp;lrm;]] character at the end of the span.

'''Note''' that this is not required for normal insertion of a string in a [[w:Writing_system#Directionality|left-to-right script]]. If you don't know what you are doing, use {{tl|lang}}.

For example, to produce strings in Arabic or Hebrew script, simply use:
&lt;pre&gt;
* The romanization of &quot;{{lang|ar|اللغة العربية}}&quot; is &quot;{{transl|ar|ISO|''al-luġah al-‘arabiyyah''}}&quot;.
* The romanization of &quot;{{lang|he|עברית}}&quot; is &quot;{{transl|he|ISO|''‘Ivrit''}}&quot;.
* {{lang|kk|Қазақ тілі}} ({{lang|kk|قازاق ڌﻳل}})
&lt;/pre&gt;

which yields
* The romanization of &quot;{{lang|ar|اللغة العربية}}&quot; is &quot;{{transl|ar|ISO|''al-luġah al-‘arabiyyah''}}&quot;.
* The romanization of &quot;{{lang|he|עברית}}&quot; is &quot;{{transl|he|ISO|''‘Ivrit''}}&quot;.
* {{lang|kk|Қазақ тілі}} ({{lang|kk|قازاق ڌﻳل}})

Inline use of the  &lt;code&gt;dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&lt;/code&gt; parameter will be restricted to very rare cases, such as use of Arabic letters as symbols in mathematical formulas, or several levels of nested ltr-within-rtl-within-ltr.

Further note that
:''For the 'direction' property to affect reordering in inline-level elements, the 'unicode-bidi' property's value must be 'embed' or 'override'.''[http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#direction]
and that the point of the  &lt;code&gt;dir&lt;/code&gt; parameter is proper line-breaking behavior: if a linebreak separates {{lang|ar|اللغة العربية}}, it should be &quot;{{lang|ar| العربية}}&quot;, not &quot;{{lang|ar|اللغة }}&quot; that is taken to the next line.

==Usage==
Paste the code for the relevant office and then add the [[#Personal data|personal data]] to the bottom. There are no required fields and some fields will not appear when others are in use. For instructions on how to implement multiple terms, see [[Template:Infobox officeholder/example#Multiple terms|this page]].

The parameter {{para|order}} is used in conjunction with {{para|office}} to state that the officeholder is the ''n''th holder of the office, for example &quot;2nd President of Mauritius&quot;. If {{para|order}} is not specified, the value of {{para|office}} can be [[Help:Editing#Wikilinks|wikilinked]] in the usual way, for example, &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Ministry of Defence (Singapore)|Minister for Defence]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. However, if {{para|order}} is specified together with {{para|office}}, the value of {{para|office}} is automatically linked to a Wikipedia article of the same name, whether such an article exists or not. Wikilinking cannot be used to redirect the link elsewhere, but a piped link can be created like this: &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Ministry of Defence (Singapore){{!}}Minister for Defence&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; (note that the double square brackets have been omitted).

When both a start and an end term are given, you can instead specify the complete term using using the parameters {{para|term}}, {{para|terms2}}, etc. This can be helpful with complicated terms that cannot be given as simple starting or ending dates, or if you prefer something other than the default term separator (an en dash, with spaces around it if the start or end is not a simple integer date).

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
This template encapsulates the {{tag|references |single}} tag to show the list of references defined by {{tag|ref}} tags,  with some formatting. It reduces the font size and has options for columns and groups. References can be defined within the body of the article or within the reference list.

The {{tag|ref}} and {{tag|references |single}} tags are part of the [[mw:Extension:Cite/Cite.php|Cite.php]] MediaWiki extension.

{{tl|Reflist}} may be used with {{tl|Refbegin}} and {{tl|Refend}} to format different styles of references.

== Usage ==

;Using only footnote-style references
&lt;pre&gt;
== Content ==
Lorem ipsum.&lt;ref&gt;Source name, access date, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.&lt;ref&gt;Source name, access date, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

== References ==
{{Reflist}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

;Using only bibliographical style references
&lt;pre&gt;
== Content ==
Lorem ipsum.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

== References ==
{{refbegin}}
* reference 1
* reference 2
{{refend}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

;Using both footnote-style and bibliography-style references
&lt;pre&gt;
== Content ==
Lorem ipsum.&lt;ref&gt;Source name, access date, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.&lt;ref&gt;Source name, access date, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorem ipsum.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

== References ==
{{Reflist}}

{{Refbegin}}
* reference 1
* reference 2
{{Refend}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Font size ==
The font size should reduce to 90% for most browsers. Note that there is no consensus that a small font size should always be used for references; when normal-sized font is more appropriate on a page, use {{tag|references |single}} instead.

== Columns ==
Columns are currently supported only by [[w:Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]]-based browsers (such as [[Mozilla Firefox]]). See [[#Browser support for columns|below]] for more information.

Using {{tlx|Reflist|2}} will create a two-column reference list, and {{tlx|Reflist|3}} will create a three-column list.  Three-column lists may be inaccessible to users with smaller/laptop monitors and should be avoided.

Using {{tlx|Reflist|30em}} will allow the browser to automatically choose the number of columns based on the width of the web browser.  Choose a column width that is appropriate for the average width of the references on the page.

== Multiple uses ==

If {{tl|Reflist}} is used multiple times without a parameter, each instance will include all of the previously defined references. To force the parser to close previous references, each use of {{tl|Reflist}} must be forced as a new instance by the use of any parameter. Even an undefined parameter such as {{tlx|Reflist|close&amp;#61;1}} will force the references to close.

== Grouped references ==
The footnotes system supports the separation of references into groups. This allows groups for explanatory notes, table references and the like.

The general format for the reference tag would be:

:{{tag|ref group&amp;#61;''&quot;groupname&quot;''|open}}

And for the reflist:
:{{tlx|Reflist|group&amp;#61;''&quot;groupname&quot;''}}

:Where ''groupname'' would be a group identifier such as &quot;note&quot;, &quot;nb&quot; or &quot;label&quot;.

== List-defined references ==
References may be defined within {{tl|reflist}} using {{para|refs}} and invoked within the content. There are new error messages associated with this update, documented at [[Help:Editing#References]]. As usual, groups can be used. Defined references must be used within the body; unused references will show an error message.

=== Example ===

&lt;pre&gt;
This is reference 1.&lt;ref name=&quot;refname1&quot; group=&quot;groupname&quot;/&gt;
This is reference 2.&lt;ref name=&quot;refname2&quot; group=&quot;groupname&quot;/&gt;
This is reference 3.&lt;ref name=&quot;refname3&quot; group=&quot;groupname&quot;/&gt;

{{Reflist|group=&quot;groupname&quot;|refs=
&lt;ref name=&quot;refname1&quot; group=&quot;groupname&quot;&gt;content1&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=&quot;refname2&quot; group=&quot;groupname&quot;&gt;content2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=&quot;refname3&quot; group=&quot;groupname&quot;&gt;content3&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Result ===

This is reference 1.&lt;ref name=&quot;refname1&quot; group=&quot;groupname&quot;/&gt;
This is reference 2.&lt;ref name=&quot;refname2&quot; group=&quot;groupname&quot;/&gt;
This is reference 3.&lt;ref name=&quot;refname3&quot; group=&quot;groupname&quot;/&gt;

{{Reflist|group=&quot;groupname&quot;|refs=
&lt;ref name=&quot;refname1&quot;&gt;content1&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=&quot;refname2&quot;&gt;content2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=&quot;refname3&quot;&gt;content3&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

== Technical details ==

=== Browser support for columns ===

Multiple columns are generated by using [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS3]], which is still in development; thus only browsers that properly support the multi-column property will show multiple columns with {{tl|Reflist}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;stuffandnonsense&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;w3org1&quot; /&gt;

; Supports columns
These browsers support CSS3 columns:
* [[w:Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]]-based browsers such as [[Mozilla Firefox]]; earlier versions had a bug that created broken links in multiple columns
* [[w:WebKit|WebKit]]-based browsers such as [[w:Safari (web browser)|Safari]] and [[w:Google Chrome|Google Chrome]]; Webkit versions earlier than 533 have a link positioning bug; Safari 5.x (7533.17) and Chrome 5.0 or higher resolve this issue

; No column support
These browsers do not support CSS3 columns:
* Microsoft [[w:Trident (layout engine)|Trident]]-based browsers including [[Internet Explorer]] through version 9 Beta&lt;ref name=msdn /&gt;
* [[w:Opera (web browser)|Opera]] through version 10

=== Supporting CSS ===
{{tl|Reflist}} uses a CSS rule in [[MediaWiki:Common.css/References.css]] to set the font size:

* &lt;code&gt;div.references { font-size: 90%; }&lt;/code&gt;

One of the the following classes is assigned by the template when either column count or column width is set:

* &lt;code&gt;.references-column-count&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.references-column-count-''n''&lt;/code&gt; (where &lt;code&gt;''n''&lt;/code&gt; is the numer of columns)
* &lt;code&gt;.references-column-width&lt;/code&gt;

The following CSS properties are utilized using the {{tl|column-count}} and {{tl|column-width}} templates:

* &lt;code&gt;column-count&lt;/code&gt; CSS3 standard
* &lt;code&gt;column-width&lt;/code&gt; CSS3 standard
* &lt;code&gt;-moz-column-count&lt;/code&gt; Mozilla CSS extension
* &lt;code&gt;-moz-column-width&lt;/code&gt; Mozilla CSS extension
* &lt;code&gt;-webkit-column-count&lt;/code&gt; Webkit CSS extension
* &lt;code&gt;-webkit-column-width&lt;/code&gt; Webkit CSS extension

=== Customizing the view ===
By editing your CSS, the personal appearance of the reference list can be customized. From [[Special:Preferences|Preferences]], select the Appearance tab, then on the selected skin select Custom CSS. After editing and saving, follow the instructions at the top of the page to purge.

;Font size
The font size defaults to 90% of the standard size. To change it, add:

&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;div.references { font-size: 90%; }&lt;/source&gt;

Change 90% to the desired size.

;Columns
To disable columns, add:

&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
.references-column-count, .references-column-width {
    column-count: 1 !important;
    column-width: auto !important;
    -moz-column-count: 1 !important;
    -moz-column-width: auto !important;
    -webkit-column-count: 1 !important;
    -webkit-column-width: auto !important;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Similarly, to force all reference lists to a number of columns, change the number.

;Column dividers
To add dividers (rules) between columns, add:

&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
.references-column-count, .references-column-width {
    column-rule: 1px solid #aaa;
    -moz-column-rule: 1px solid #aaa;
    -webkit-column-rule: 1px solid #aaa;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

You can alter the appearance of the dividers by changing the values.

=== Collapsing and scrolling ===
There have been a number of requests to add functionality for a collapsible or scrolling reference list. These requests have not been fulfilled to due to issues with readability, accessibility, and printing.

The links between the inline cite and the reference list do not work when the reference list is enclosed in a collapsed box.

'''{{tl|refbegin}}''' and its complementary closing template '''{{tl|refend}}''' are used to apply any of several optional styles or presentational choices for [[w:bibliography|bibliographies]] or reference lists&amp;mdash;that is, lists of fully-specified references / sources / works cited, alpha-sorted by author/contributor) that appear in books.

These bibliographies or reference lists frequently appear in dedicated sections within an article, variously titled &lt;tt&gt;==&amp;nbsp;References&amp;nbsp;==&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;==&amp;nbsp;Works cited&amp;nbsp;==&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;==&amp;nbsp;Bibliography&amp;nbsp;==&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;==&amp;nbsp;Further reading&amp;nbsp;==&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;==&amp;nbsp;Published works&amp;nbsp;==&lt;/tt&gt;, and so on. 

Wikibooks referencing or citation systems that use bibliography-style reference lists include: 'shortened' footnotes, parenthetical referencing, and 'general' referencing. The 'full' footnote and embedded citations referencing systems do not use those lists, although books using these latter two systems may also contain &quot;Further reading&quot; or other sections containing bibliography-style listings, that {{tl|refbegin}} formatting could be applied to.

The formatting options provided by this template are:
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+refbegin template options/parameters
!Option!!How to get it||Notes
|-
|'''font size reduction'''||&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{refbegin}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;||no parameters needed, default will reduce to 90% of standard browser text size
|-
|'''display list in multiple columns'''||&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{refbegin|n}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;||where '''''n''''' determines the number of columns, or width of columns based on the browser's screen width
|-
|'''apply hanging indent'''||&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{refbegin|indent=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;||will apply hanging indent if an individual reference wraps over more than one line in the browser's display window
|-
|}
Each use of {{tl|refbegin}} whether with or without parameters, needs an accompanying {{tl|refend}} closing template to 'turn off' the formatting; refend does not need any parameters.

Font size reduction is always applied. Either one, the other, or both of multi-columns and hanging indent may be applied as well (though see specifics and caveats on browser differences in relevant sections, below).

== Usage ==
With all (optional) parameters shown:
&lt;pre&gt;
==References==
{{ refbegin |n |indent= |indentsize= }} 
* list of bibliography/references entries..
...

{{refend}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Placement===
The {{tl|refbegin}} is placed immediately below the header of the bibliography/references section its formatting will be applied to. The closing {{tl|refend}} template is placed within the same section, at the end of the bibliography/references list content.

When used, each occurrence of {{tl|refbegin}} should always be paired with a corresponding closing {{tl|refend}} template:
&lt;pre&gt;
==References==
{{refbegin}}
*1st entry in the bibliography/references list.. 
*2nd entry in the bibliography/references list.. 
...
*last entry in the bibliography/references list.. 

{{refend}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The formatting provided by {{tl|refbegin}} is &quot;turned on&quot; at the location where the template is placed, and is applied to ''all'' text after and below it, until it is &quot;turned off&quot; by a closing {{tl|refend}} template (or &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; tag). Failing to provide a closing {{tl|refend}} may produce unwanted effects in other sections that may appear below the 'References', 'Bibliography' etc section, such as 'External links' sections that are usually placed at or near the article's end.

===Option 1: Text size (default behavior)===
The default usage (without parameters) applies a style that reduces the text size of the bibliographies/reference list entries. This can be useful to make a long bibliography/list of references display more compactly, and it also mimics the formatting style applied to footnotes by the {{tl|reflist}} template. 

The {{tl|reflist}} formats footnotes—any text in the article body that is placed between {{tag|ref}} tags—that are auto-generated by the [[w:Wikipedia:Cite.php|cite.php]] extension, called by {{tl|reflist}}. In the case of articles using the 'shortened' footnotes referencing system, these footnotes will typically contain an abbreviated citation such as &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2002, p.123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; that corresponds with an entry in the bibliography/references list section (other text such as discursive notes may appear as well). 

The font size should reduce to 90% for most browsers, but may appear to show at 100% for Internet Explorer and possibly other browsers. Reflist uses one CSS entry in [[MediaWiki:Common.css/References.css]] to set the font size:
* &lt;code&gt;div.references { font-size: 90%; }&lt;/code&gt;

Editors may override this setting by placing entries in their personal CSS.

If the 'full' footnotes referencing system is used (i.e. there is no separate bibliography/references list, all cites/references are defined in {{tag|ref}} tags), then use {{tl|reflist}} alone:
&lt;pre&gt;
== References ==
{{reflist}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If there is a bibliography/references list but no footnoted citations (eg in general references or parenthetical referencing systems) then use {{tl|refbegin}} and {{tl|refend}} like so:

&lt;pre&gt;
== References ==
{{refbegin}}
* general reference 1
* general reference 2
{{refend}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If there are footnoted citations and a separate bibliography/references list, then place {{tl|reflist}} to generate the footnotes in one section (immediately above the bibliography/references list), and use {{tl|refbegin}} in the latter section:

&lt;pre&gt;
== Notes ==
{{reflist}} &lt;!--this will auto-generate the numbered list of footnotes/cites --&gt; 

== References ==
{{refbegin}}
* bibliography entry / reference 1
* bibliography entry / reference 2
* etc
{{refend}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Option 2: Multiple columns ===
If an integer ''n'' is supplied as the first parameter, the template will display the bibliography/references list in n columns. This may be useful for compact display for a lengthy list, and matches also the optional capability of {{tl|reflist}} to display output in multiple columns. Thus, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{refbegin|2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; will display the list in two columns. If no integer parameter is specified, the default is a single column. Note, it will rarely be useful or practical to display bibliography/references list entries in more than two columns.

If a value with a unit is supplied as the first parameter, ie. &lt;tt&gt;30em&lt;/tt&gt;, the template will display the bibliography/references list in columns with a minimum width of that value, allowing the browser to determin the optimal number of columns. Using &lt;nowiki&gt;{{refbegin|20em}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; for instance is usefull for short citations.

==== Browser support ====
Multiple columns are generated by using [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS3]], which is still in development; thus only browsers that properly support the multi-column property will show multiple columns.
* [[Mozilla Firefox]] and other [[w:Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]]-based browsers and [[w:Safari (web browser)|Safari]], [[w:Google Chrome|Google Chrome]] and other [[w:WebKit|WebKit]] support multiple columns, but may create [[w:Widows and orphans|widows]]
* [[Internet Explorer]] through version 9 beta does not support columns
* [[w:Opera (web browser)|Opera]] through version 10.63 does not support columns

=== Option 3: Hanging indentation ===
A [[w:hanging indentation|hanging indentation]] may be applied to bibliographies/reference lists by using the {{para|indent}} parameter. This option can be useful in long bibliographies/reference lists and in particular when individual entries in the list are long, ie they wrap over more than one line in the browser display window. Applying a hanging indent to the list makes it much easier to distinguish the keywords (ie normally the authors' names) in the bibliography and makes the stand out from preceding and succeeding lines of text. Hanging indents in bibliographies also form part of several widely used citation style implementations, such as APA, MLA, and Chicago.

In order for indents to display properly, do not use bullet markers ('''*'''); you must use indent markers (''':''') instead.

To use, set &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{refbegin|indent=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This Emerging Instructional Technology book is the product of the students in the Emerging Instructional Technology course taught at the [http://www.uni.edu University of Northern Iowa] in Fall of 2007.  The Emerging Instructional Technologies was offered as an &quot;experimental course&quot; because this was the first semester that it was offered. 

These topics were selected by teams and they created learning environments to introduce the rest of the class to the topic and its educational opportunities.  Each team used a teaching method that incorporated its technology as well as providing an on-going learning process that began before the students attended on their assigned night and continued until after that evening as they completed and submitted their assignments. 

Finally, each group compiled their research and experiences into research-based chapters for this book.  You will notice that we have standardized the formats for each of the chapters.  We have them divided into the ''Introduction and Background, Definitions, Ethics, Instructional Use, Conclusions and Recommendations, Examples/Case Studies, and References''.

We would be interested in your feedback about our first venture into wikibooks.  You can email me at zeitz{{@}}uni.edu.

* Angle of Difference Between Voltage and Current
In RL series circuit, only L is the component that depends on frequency . There is no difference between voltage and current on R . There is an angle difference between voltage and current by 90 degree . When connect R and L in series , there is a difference in angle between voltage and current from 0 to 90 degree which can be expressed as a mathematic formula below
: &lt;math&gt;Tan \theta = \omega \frac{L}{R} = 2 \pi f  \frac{L}{R} = 2 \pi \frac{1}{t}  \frac{L}{R} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = Tan \theta \frac{R}{L}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{1}{2\pi} Tan \theta \frac{R}{L}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t = 2\pi \frac{1}{Tan \theta} \frac{L}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

* In Summary
RL series circuit has a first order differential equation of current 


Which has one real root of the form
:&lt;math&gt;I(t) = Ae^\frac{t}{T}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;A = e^c&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}f(t) + \frac{1}{T} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
Which has solution in the form
: &lt;math&gt;f(t) = A e^\frac{-t}{T}&lt;/math&gt;

* LC will generate Oscillation of Standing Sin Wave of frequency
: &lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;

* RLC will act as Resonant Tuned Selected Bandpass Filter
: &lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}} at I = \frac{V}{R}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\delta \omega = \omega_2 - \omega_1 at I = \frac{V}{2R} &lt;/math&gt;

{{intricate template}}
{{info|This template should be used only when needed. There is no need to add this template to every talk page. Do not create a talk page just to add this template.}}

This [[Wikibooks:Templates|template]] is a signpost. It is intended to be used on particularly active [[WB:DISCUSS|talk pages]] that attract commentary from inexperienced editors, and/or high levels of debate from everyone. It provides:

* A short introduction and appropriate links for newcomers.
* A reminder of policy to experienced Wikipedians.
* A list of links to the current talk page's archives.
* An optional archive search box.

=== Usage ===
&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow: auto&quot;&gt;{{talk header}}&lt;/pre&gt;

To add this template to a talk page, just edit the talk page, and put {{tl|talk header}} at the top of the page (above existing conversations).

Talk pages that attract frequent or perpetual debate, articles often subject controversy, and/or recent-and-highly-visible topics are usually appropriate for this template. Calm talk pages do not need this template.

This template should not be added to otherwise empty talk pages.  That changes the &quot;discussion&quot; tab at the top of the page from a &quot;red link&quot; into a &quot;blue link&quot;, which may mislead people into thinking there is discussion.

=== Parameters ===
Full syntax:

&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow: auto&quot;&gt;{{talk header|noarchive=no|search=yes|txtpol=no|wp=no|disclaimer=no|bottom=no|shortcut1|shortcut2|shortcut3|shortcut4|shortcut5}}&lt;/pre&gt;

*Up to five shortcuts can be added to the template, as [[Help:Template#Templates with unnamed parameters|unnamed parameters]].  For example, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{talk header|WB:SHOR|WB:TCUT}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. They will display similar to the {{tlx|shortcut}} template, but within the talk header message box.
*A search bar can be displayed to allow editors to search the archives of a talk page by using the parameter &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|search=yes&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. For example: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{talk header|search=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. To deactivate the search feature, simply do not add the field.
*For use on WikiProject talk pages, the parameter &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|wp=yes&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; can be included to add &quot;and anything related to its purposes and tasks.&quot; to the top line of the banner.
*When used on a talk page that has archives, links to those archives will be displayed automatically within this template. To switch this off, use the parameter &lt;code&gt;|noarchive=yes&lt;/code&gt;. For example: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{talk header|noarchive=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. ''In order for automatic archive links to be displayed, archives must be [[WB:ARCHIVE|named in the standard way]]. A link to the archive index is also displayed, if it is named &quot;/Archive index&quot;. If no archives exist for the current talk page, or if archives exist but possess non-standard names, no archive links will be displayed.''
*On user talk pages, &lt;code&gt;|disclaimer=yes&lt;/code&gt; adds an additional banner which identifies the page as being originally from Wikibooks (and modifies the width to suit), matching the style of {{tl|userpage}}.
*Additional policy content can be added to talk headers on user talk pages by adding &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|txtpol=yes&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
*To add an additional instructions to &quot;please place new discussions at the bottom of the talk page&quot;, use &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|bottom=yes&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Hiding the template ===
If you would prefer not to see this template on any talk page, you can hide it from your view. You'll need to have an account to do this.

# Edit your [[Special:MyPage/skin.css|user style]] page.
# Add a line: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;#talkheader {display:none;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
# Save the change.
# Bypass your cache.

=== Appearances variations ===
Be aware that this template will appear differently in different [[Help:Pages#Namespaces|namespaces]]. In particular, in the main namespace, there is an additional box of &quot;Textbook policies&quot;. That box does not appear when this template is used in any other namespace (including the template namespace) but may be optionally added with the &lt;code&gt;|txtpol=yes&lt;/code&gt; parameter. Here is what the template looks like with the &quot;Textbook policies&quot; box:

{{talk header|txtpol=yes}}

=== Template editing notes ===
Please [[Template talk:Talk header|discuss]] ''before'' making changes to this template. Unannounced action tends to lead to a flurry of editing. Differences in personal taste have lead to &quot;perpetual tweaking&quot; in the past.

By design, this template appears differently depending on which [[Help:Pages#Namespaces|namespace]] it is used in. One should remain conscious of how this will impact your changes. In particular, the number of columns can vary, affecting text width for line wrapping.

== Biographical Information ==

:Beverly Cleary was born Beverly Atlee Bunn on April 12, 1916 in McMinnville, Oregon. She grew up on a farm in Yamhill, which was a town so small that it didn’t even have a library. Cleary’s mother arranged for books from the state library to be sent to Yamhill and stored in a makeshift library above a bank. In this setting, Cleary learned to love books and reading. Her school’s librarian once suggested that she write books for children when she grew up. Because of this suggestion, Cleary did eventually write the children’s books that she had wanted to read as a child, books that she couldn’t find on her own bookshelves.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beverlycleary.com/about.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

:In 1934, Beverly Cleary moved to California to attend college. While in school, she worked as a substitute librarian, and eventually became a full-time librarian. She was able to connect with the children who would come into the library because they, like herself as a child, weren’t able to find books that they could relate to; they couldn’t find books about kids like themselves. This is when Cleary decided to begin her writing career. She married Clarence T. Cleary in 1940; they are the parents of twins. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/contributor/beverly-cleary&lt;/ref&gt;

:Children have fallen in love with Cleary's famous characters such as Henry Huggins, Ellen Tebbits, Beezus and Ramona, and Ralph S. Mouse for decades. Cleary has written more than thirty books and won several awards. “Drop Everything And Read Day” (DEAR) is celebrated on her birthday, April 12.


== Awards and Honors ==
:Cleary has won over thirty awards and honors, including the following:

:1975 Laura Ingalls Wilder Award
:1978 Newbery Honor Book, Ramona and Her Father
:1980 Regina Medal
:1982 Newbery Honor Book, Ramona Quimby, Age 8
:1984 Newbery Medal, Dear Mr. Henshaw
:1985 Everychild Award


== Books of Interest ==

'''&lt;u&gt;Henry Huggins&lt;/u&gt;''' 
:This book was Cleary's first and was written in 1950. It tells the story of a boy named Henry Huggins who believes that his life is boring and that he never experiences anything exciting. Things change for Henry when he finds a dog, names him Ribsy, and decides to keep him. And so begins Henry's new, exciting life! This book is an important part of Cleary's collection because it was written in response to a letter from a child wanting to find books about &quot;kids like us.&quot; Henry Huggins reappeared in later Cleary books. Readers are able to connect to the &quot;realness&quot; of Henry's character and delight in his new life with Ribsy.

'''&lt;u&gt;Ellen Tebbits&lt;/u&gt;''' 
:This is the story of a young girl named Ellen who is embarrassed by a secret that she has...until she meets Austine and finds out that she has the same secret! They quickly become great friends and spend all of their time together. The girls both realize how much easier the world is when someone is there for support. Then Ellen does something to make Austine stop talking to her. This is a story of friendship, growing up, and finding your way. The story is realistic, believable, and relatable for all readers. 

'''&lt;u&gt;The Mouse and the Motorcycle&lt;/u&gt;'''
:Ralph S. Mouse lives in a run-down hotel in California. He has a comfortable life, but what he really desires is a life of danger, speed, and excitement. One day a boy named Keith leaves a toy motorcycle out, which, of course, Ralph attempts to drive. He ends up falling with the motorcycle into a garbage can. Keith finds Ralph and the motorcycle in the garbage and the two become friends. Keith shows Ralph how to start and use the motorcycle, and Ralph ends up having his life of excitement...until he loses the motorcycle. Keith is upset with him and stops trusting him. When Keith becomes sick, Ralph is the one to help him, and their friendship is rekindled. This book was eventually adapted into a movie in 1986.

'''&lt;u&gt;Dear Mr. Henshaw&lt;/u&gt;'''
:&lt;u&gt;Dear Mr. Henshaw&lt;/u&gt; was written in 1983 and was awarded the Newbery Award in 1984. This book is written as a series of diary entries and letters between the main character, a boy named Leigh, and Mr. Henshaw, Leigh's favorite author. Boyd Henshaw has been Leigh's favorite author since second grade. Now that he's in sixth grade and the new kid at school, he continues his letter-writing to the author for a school assignment. When Mr. Henshaw responds, Leigh is reluctant to reply. As Leigh's responses to Mr. Henshaw are shown, the reader learns of the trials and tribulations of this sixth grader's life. The reader learns that Leigh is struggling with his parents' divorce, being the new kid at school, and bullies. Leigh's letters and diary entries are therapeutic to him and help him realize that he has to learn to accept certain situations in his life. This story covers many aspects of everyday life that children of all ages can relate to: loneliness, school issues, and problems at home to name a few.

'''&lt;u&gt;Socks&lt;/u&gt;'''
:&lt;u&gt;Socks&lt;/u&gt; is a fun book written from the perspective of a tabby cat. Socks is a happy cat that lives with the Brickers, a young couple who has always given him everything he needs. However, when new baby Charles joins the family, Socks begins to feel as if he's been forgotten. He is gradually given less and less attention and even ends up living in the garage for a while! While trying to find his place in this new family, Socks gets into trouble more than once. The Brickers eventually realize that they have been neglecting Socks since they brought Charles home. As Charles grows, Socks comes to the conclusion that Charles is his friend, not his enemy, and eventually finds his place in the family. This book includes several drawings throughout that help illustrate the plot. The story contains realistic, easy-to-follow conversations and interactions between the Brickers and Socks. 

'''&lt;u&gt;Ramona's World&lt;/u&gt;'''
:This book is the last in the &quot;Ramona&quot; series and was also the last book published by Beverly Cleary. The famous Cleary character Ramona is now in fourth grade and is sure that it will be the best year of her life so far. Ramona loves her new teacher and even has a new best friend, Daisy. However, Ramona soon learns that fourth grade isn't so great; her teacher wants her to be a better speller, a task that does not come easily to Ramona. Ramona also struggles with her older sister, Beezus, who is now in high school, as well as with her baby sister, Roberta. Like many other children, Ramona wants to be given more responsibilities, such as babysitting her little sister or cat-sitting for Daisy. Ramona is still at odds with her nemesis, Susan, although they eventually come to understand each other better. As in many of the other &quot;Ramona&quot; books, Ramona comes to realize that she's doing a good job of growing up.


== Writing Patterns and Style ==
:Cleary has been known to say that she wrote her books to simply entertain her readers; she wasn't trying to teach anyone a lesson. Cleary's books are easy for children to relate to because they often deal with realistic, everyday situations that children come across during the course of their own lives. Her books cover topics such as new siblings, moving, friendships, etc. Cleary's books have universal appeal and are still captivating readers more than sixty years after the first book was published.

:Cleary's books often contain realistic dialogue and recurring characters. For example, Ramona appears in at least eight different books. Readers are able to form relationships with these characters and follow them as they grow and develop. Cleary's books are often illustrated with black and white sketch-styled pictures that are used to build on and represent the plot. Alan Tiegreen was the illustrator for several of her books.

== Closure ==
Closure is a property that is defined for a set of numbers and an operation.  This [[w:Closure_(mathematics)| Wikipedia article]] gives a description of the closure property with examples from various areas in math.  As an Algebra student being aware of the closure property can help you solve a problem.  For instance a problem might state &quot;The sum of two whole numbers is 24.&quot;  With practice you will be able to see that the possible set of numbers will be either all odd (e.g. (1,23),(3,21), ... etc.) or all even (e.g. (2,22), (4,20), ... etc.).  The problem might not explicitly state the idea of whole numbers.  It might state that two sides of a square sum to 24. If you remember working a problem like this before you know that the sides of a square need to be equal and you divide by two.  The author of the problem might want to be trickier and say that two sides of an equilateral triangle sum to 24 and then ask for the perimeter of the triangle.  In this case you might want to write the equation &lt;math&gt;3x = p&lt;/math&gt; for the perimeter of an equilateral triangle. This might make it easier for you to see that again you just need to divide 24 by 2 to find the length of one side and plug it into the equation.

You should check this page regularly, and put it on [[Special:Watchlist|your watchlist]].

Feel free to email me, or leave messages at [[User_talk:TDang|my talk page]] if you are unclear on anything.

== October 14 ==
Reminder: As stated [[User:TDang/Econ452Assignments#October_2|below]], ''please remember to login when editing''. If you aren't logged in, I may well not be able to identify your contribution as your own, and this will impact your grade.

== October 13 ==
There now are reviews up from your classmates [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Review_.231|here]] and reviews from me [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#TDang_reviews|here]]. Look over the reviews and try to use them to extend and improve your project.

I've added a few new sections to look over.
* [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Some_references|a references section]] gives some suggestions from me for places you can look for more information about various topics. I've looked over these references to different degrees, it's up to you to filter them for usefulness. I wil likely add more as time goes on. You should also feel free to add references here, with enough explanation that a classmate can get an idea about the topic.
* I've put [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Adding_Citations|instructions for adding citations]]. You can see how the reference appears like a footnote-link in the text, and then in the [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#References|References]] section at the bottom of the page. Give this a try soon for your material, and ask me for help if it's not working. For the final version of the project  material should be well-referenced, using this citation method.
* I have started a [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Style_guide|Style guide]] with standards which all parts of the book should follow. I'll add things as they come up, and you should feel free to add suggestions as well.

== October 6 ==
For Thursday, October 8, I want you to review another group's contribution to the Wikibook so far. A description of the review goals, plus what you should review is at the [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Review_.231|main project talk page]]. Put your review there.

This is an individual-level assignment, your other group members will mostly be reviewing different sections.

== October 2 ==
On Tuesday, October 6, I will assign each student to do a review of another group's work to date. Between now and Tuesday, that means you should try to have entered enough material and sensible-enough material that a classmate can do a meaningful review.

On Thursday, October 8, the review will be due.

Please remember to log in when editing. There are (at least) two reasons for this. The first reason is that I'm going to review your individual contributions to the project by looking at the automatically-generated &quot;contributions&quot; list. (For example, see my contributions [[Special:Contributions/TDang|here]].) If you're not logged in, then I'm likely to miss your contribution.

A second reason is that you're likely to want to use your [[Special:Watchlist]], which you can only do if you're logged in. BTW, I find it most useful to look at the watchlist with a long history. You can do that by clicking on the &quot;'''all'''&quot; option on the watchlist each time you use it. You can have a long history every time you use the watchlists by editing your [[Special:Preferences|preferences]]. Go to &quot;'''Watchlist'''&quot;, set the &quot;Days to show in watchlist&quot; to 7, and then make sure to click the &quot;'''Save'''&quot; button at the bottom.

== September 15 ==

Time to start writing. If you are stumped, and don't know what you want to start writing about, email me. I can assign you a topic area.

For Thursday, September 17, I want ''each person'' to write something--along the lines of a large paragraph or two. This is the barest beginnings of getting started. The writings should be serious, but don't need to be polished, that can come later. If you are able to do more, that might be a good idea because...

For Tuesday, September 22, I want a serious beginning on your group's Wikibook contribution. I estimate that a serious beginning might be approximately 2500 words. Again, this doesn't need to be polished yet. It should show that you have a target and are headed toward the target. Different group members may contribute in different amounts, but every group member should contribute directly.

== September 14 ==
This is a refresher on what you should have already done on the Wikibook.

* You should have read my introductions: [[User:TDang/Getting started|Getting started]] and [[User:TDang/Class editing|Class editing]].
* You should have created an account here.
* You should have read standard Wikibook introduction documents, on the rules, and the technical aspects of editing.
* You should have added yourself at the [[User:TDang/Classlist|classlist]]
* You should have participated in the discussion on what form we would like the Wikibook to take.
* Describe your project plan: You should have entered a description of your plan for your group's part of the Wikibook. This plan should be detailed enough that you know how to get started, and that I have an idea what to expect. You should also have identified the group you are working with. I'll need each member of your group to (at minimum) &quot;sign off&quot; that they are, in fact, a member of the group, and that they agree with the described project plan.
** You should have entered a [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Task_.2F_topic_selection_.28tentative.29|tentative]] description of your project plans and the group you will work with.
** You should have entered a [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Task_.2F_topic_selection_.28for_real.29|final (more or less)]] description of your project plans and the group you will work with.
** ''Note that the &quot;final&quot; description is required regardless of your tentative description or what you told me during class.''

=== Note on pseudonyms ===
I recommended you create your account using a pseudonym. The reason for this is that everything you do here is publicly viewable by everyone on the internet. It seems wise to be careful about embarrassing yourself, and guard your real identity. If this isn't important to you, and you would rather use your real identity (as I am doing), you certainly may do so.

However, if you are mentioning another classmate, and they are using a pseudonym, you '''must''' respect their anonymity by referring to them only by their username, not their real-life name.

=== Note on technical aspects of editing ===
Given that you should have done the above, I am going to assume that you have a basic understanding of technical aspects of Wikibook editing, so that technical difficulties shouldn't slow you down on any future assignments. If there are still technical issues which are a problem, I encourage you to do test editing. You may ask me for technical help during my office hours, or post questions for more advanced users here.</text>

The purpose of this exercise is to get you to practice using your mathematical intuition.  Examples will be given showing which answers are false.  The questions that are marked True require us to define our terms.  Because all of these sets of numbers have infinite members we would have to use a recursive definition.  Creating an argument with a recursive definition requires a proficiency with mathematical language that you'll be ready for after reading this book.

Possible ideas for WB contributions

==Topics==
This is a partial list of areas which could be covered in the book. Many of these areas are quite large, and could be partially covered as a complete project. There are certainly other possible areas not (yet) included here.

===General===
* network externalities
* two-sided platforms 
* network structure
* piracy - ''(someone is planning to do this)''
* standards (HTML, Flash, etc.)
* compatibility
* open-source (software and other)
* intellectual property
* network neutrality
* innovation
* collaborative filtering
* globalization
* computer-aided-manufacturing (3D printing)
* virtual workspace
* Electronic delivery of content
* Overlapping of digital and realspace
* non-digital information goods (pharmaceuticals?)
* information technology back-end (inventory, relationship management...)
* legal and anti-trust
* business-to-business
* how to market high quality
* DRM (digital rights management)
* HTML5 (will this change business, or is it purely technical?)
* search engine optimization

===Specific industries===
* computer games (single-player)
* computer games (multiplayer)
* Online game economies
* social networking
* News (newspapers, etc.)
* e-Books
* music
* movies

===Specific companies/products===
Mostly, I don't think it's wise to focus on specific companies, unless as a case study for more general principles. However, certain aspects of the information/internet economy are so concentrated in a few companies that it could be worthwhile to look at these dominant companies or products.

==Ways to contribute==
The most concrete way to contribute to the book is by covering some topic area well, and linking it conceptually with the rest of the book. However, there are other ways that you could contribute. Likely it would make sense to assign these to a member of your group, but it may be possible for an entire group to focus on something.

For instance:
* graphics
* case studies
* proof-reading, editing
* formatting

If you have (or want to research) technical knowledge about how something works, and the impact of that technology on the economics of doing business, that could be a valuable contribution.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before you start your magazine there is a few things you have to consider
== Your medium ==
This is important. A magazine is not the best medium in every case; it is useful for a (bi-)weekly or monthly publication on a certain topic (science, politics, fashion). It is not often used as a shorter than monthly publication, it has a certain size restriction and it is expected to have only one copy. An Alternatives is newspapers, they are usually printed daily or weekly, have no size restrictions and has no topic restrictions. Another alternative is a news letter, these are good because they can easily be sent as an email or in print, the topic can be anything, although it is primarily used by certain organization to give news about themselves

Please create Alphabet pages in the Wikijunior: namespace. For example, to create vegetable alphabet, you should go to [[Wikijunior:Vegetable Alphabet]] rather than [[Vegetable alphabet]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==QoS Default Class==

I'm using Tomato 1.28 on a WRT54GL. The Default class does not behave as a catch all for connections that don't match any of the rules. I assigned the default class to be &quot;Class D&quot; (and nothing else to that class). I'm seeing anywhere between 2 to 6 connections in Class D.  There is no reason why they should be in class D. The connections are through the WAN. And I have a catch-all rule which assigns all TCP and UDP connections on all ports (1 - 65535) into the Lowest class.

Some connections that apparently match this Lowest rule end up Unclassified. I can buy that; maybe they have traffic in the incoming direction only, and the explanation is that purely internal or incoming-only connections are unclassified for QoS. Fine.

But why there are Class D connections is a complete mystery. Also it's a mystery why these are all for a particular client IP within my network.

The only thing different about that IP is that I have a Layer 7 rule set up for that IP for Skype-to-Skype traffic. But that rule is tied to the Highest class, not Class D. Moreover, the Class D connections are usually Bittorrent. Nothing to do with Skype. 

Another machine is running BT also, but the router does not report any Class D connections for that client. All of that machine's BT connections are either Unclassified or Lowest, as you would expect.

The QoS in Tomato is definitely quirky.

== USB Printing has a bad link ==

The first link for setting Tomato up for USB printing leads to a non-existent web address. It is time for me to pack it in for the evening, and I don't have the time to run the reference down, assuming it still exists.

== Violation of licensing ==

You '''cannot''' copy and paste content from Wikipedia, including templates.  You '''must''' request imports at [[WB:RFI]] or your copy-pastes will be deleted as copyright violations.  Thank you for your cooperation. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 17:51, 31 August 2010 (UTC)

:I believe that the copied templates have now been handled.  Given that there are over a thousand of them in the relevant series, I think it would be far easier to simply use the flag image directly from Commons for the countries you are discussing.  Doing so will save a great deal of trouble. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 20:48, 31 August 2010 (UTC)

== Messier Index ==

What is your take on [[Messier Index]]? Should it be as big as it is with all the references? Or should we pare it down so it is like a handbook? [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 15:51, 24 July 2010 (UTC)

: My take is [[WB:NOTPAPER|Wikibooks is not paper]]. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:59, 24 July 2010 (UTC)

::But, still, it is too big to be feasibly useful. It could take a rewriting. Any other thoughts? [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 20:22, 24 July 2010 (UTC)

::: Wikibooks has bigger books than the Messier Index. How does the size make the work unfeasible? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:32, 24 July 2010 (UTC)
:::: The problem is that it is too junky for a short-and-to-the-point quick-reference guide. [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 21:57, 24 July 2010 (UTC)
:::Format and structure is secondary to usability. Content is King, if a rewriting will remove content then you shouldn't do it. 
:::I have attempted to provide other organizational avenues to one of the books I'm continuing to, and it has lead to huge problems, there are different problems with &quot;Wikibooks are not paper&quot; and &quot;Wikibooks is not paper&quot; (the implications are different). I think that a Wikibook should be granted the chance to aspire to be paper. (Not objecting to multimedia content here, only the right of choice regarding format, structure and usability).  
:::What are you inclined to change ? Why not initiate a discussion on the book's talk first, since the people you should attempt to reach are the work's readers (place a note on the book's TOC).
:::One thing that as a user I can comment is that the primary page is too extensive in content, and the cover image on top should be relegated to another location, a monolithic version with a print option would be my favorite improvement on the work.
:::As an editor I prefer a monolithic view of the project I'm working on. For editors not having a complete view on the book structure is extremely problematic, most editors keep to specific areas of interest and mostly this is reduced to a few pages of a book. I do think that most readers act in the same way, most will never look to the complete work.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:40, 24 July 2010 (UTC)
::::Thanks for the suggestion. [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 21:57, 24 July 2010 (UTC)

:In order to plan out how to make this a strong Wikibook, a question that needs to be answered clearly is: why should this be on Wikibooks instead of Wikipedia?  (I'm serious &amp;mdash; it's not a [[wikt:rhetorical question|rhetorical&amp;nbsp;question]].)  It feels kind of like a macropedia, and macropedias ''per se'' are not in-scope for Wikibooks (except on Wikijunior).  Greatly compounding that, the pages of this book are severely in need of dewikification (even the Introduction needs dewikifying).  Right now, it feels like an adjunct of Wikipedia, and to be a proper Wikibook it has to not be that.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 22:17, 24 July 2010 (UTC)

::Well, since it is a cobbling together of a hundred pages that I had brought in from Wikipedia as a result of a request for import, this is not surprising to me.  So the answer is that unless any modification is made, they were/are on Wikipedia.  And that 300 page import requester hasn't been back either.  &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:29, 24 July 2010 (UTC)

:::Pi Zero, that is what I was wanting, someone else's opinion on it, many thanks, also to Panic. Adrignola, &lt;s&gt;I am &quot;the 300 page import requester that hasn't been back yet&quot;.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s&gt;The reason I haven't requested it is because this one isn't done yet.&lt;/s&gt; The reason it isn't done yet is because it is too junky for a short-and-to-the-point quick-reference guide. [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 22:47, 24 July 2010 (UTC)

:Should we remove all external links in all the pages? What do you all think? [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 22:47, 24 July 2010 (UTC)

::The point raised by Pi zero is pertinent and extremely relevant to any alteration, even if it is a bit uncomfortable for me since I know the effort you have put into the work. I'm not big in astronomy so my opinion of the work in terms of being a teaching material is not relevant, but there are other improvements that can be added. What is the index? How was it created? What is it's purpose/function? Defining a scope would probably address some of the concerns about viewing it simply as a Macropedia.
::In regards to external links and in special to Wikipedia my opinion is that they should be preserved if possible, maintainable and useful (I find them more useful as links than as side notes telling me that the info is on Wikipedia). In my contributions I try to make the text as easier to fallow as possible and if the information isn't already covered in the book or on Wikibooks I will often point to the relevant Wikipedia article. I will often change old Wikipedia references to the point where the content on the book has evolved to covered the item (but some items will always remain outside of the scope of the book).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:55, 24 July 2010 (UTC)

::Arlen, you are the 100 page import requester.  [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_import/2010#w:Category:Spectroscopy|This person]] is the 300 page import requester. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 00:10, 25 July 2010 (UTC)

:::Oops, I think I misunderstood you. I was thinking about importing the Herschel Catalog, which is 400 pages, once this one is done, and do the same to that one. I just figured you were meaning that as I had talked about it before. [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 00:21, 25 July 2010 (UTC)

=== Second Discussion ===
What do you think would be more useful?

#A short-and-to-the-point quick-reference guide.
#A Wikipedia book.

I think the first. [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 20:15, 31 July 2010 (UTC)

:Messier Index and anything you get done with after importing in the future should not look like something one would see at [[w:Wikipedia:Books|Wikipedia:Books]]. Ideally, a reader wouldn't be able to tell that the book had many different imports used to bootstrap its material.  The pages should transition nicely in educating on a subject. After all, Wikipedia already has 1,000+ such &quot;books&quot; already. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 00:10, 1 August 2010 (UTC)

== and the only contributor is Joe Bloggs ==

I feel that the 'and the only contributor is Joe Bloggs' part should be cut out from admins' deletion summaries; they seem to serve little purpose and in some way sounds like it's criticising the person who was the only contributor. Also, it often produces something like: Spam, vandalism or nonsense: content was 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...' and the only contributor was [[Special:Contri. That looks a bit ugly. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 08:33, 26 July 2010 (UTC)

:Yeah. I think it is part of the script. It also annoys me a little since at times it is incorrect. It should state something like &quot;request for speedy deletion was valid&quot; or just &quot;per speedy deletion request&quot; (since the rest can be implied), it would be cool if the requester name could be stated...   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 10:20, 26 July 2010 (UTC)

::That portion of the comment is essential if we state that a page was requested to be deleted by the only significant contributor.  It provides the ability to audit in some way what is being done and contact the person if wishing to appeal to them to leave the content intact.  Leaving a portion of the page in the deletion summary also provides a snapshot of the content for verification that it matches the deletion reason.  If the requester is different than the previous contributor, then you won't see that last portion.  So it will never be incorrect on that.  In some cases, however, it may not be relevant to the deletion reason. I prefer more information to less.  Far be it for me to start dictating to others whether or not they use the clean deletion summary gadget or whether they should be required to censor information about a deletion. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:09, 26 July 2010 (UTC)

:::Can it be corrected to &quot;and last contributor was ...&quot; ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:01, 31 July 2010 (UTC)

::::That would not be correct.  The &quot;only contributor...&quot; only appears if there has been a '''single''' contributor to the page as it is being deleted.  Anyone else and that's not even added to the pre-filled deletion summary.  An admin could manually note who tagged a page for speedy deletion though. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 00:05, 1 August 2010 (UTC)

:::::I think I've seen pages that I've tagged for deletion that I wasn't the only contributor (hence my reference in the above posts to &quot;at times it is incorrect&quot;). I'll wait until I noticed it again as to point to an example.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:51, 1 August 2010 (UTC)

::::::Perhaps you moved that page to another page and tagged it for deletion? [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 01:00, 1 August 2010 (UTC)

:::::::Ha I see, you may probably be right. If I perform a move I'm left as the creator of the original page location (even if I'm in reality the creator of the destination location), my confusion was that some times I don't move pages on merges but request the history merge and the closing comment &quot;seems&quot; inconsistent.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:50, 1 August 2010 (UTC)
== [[Choosing High Quality Children's Literature]] ==

Anyone else thinks it looks like a macropedia? [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 07:20, 1 August 2010 (UTC)

== [[:Category:Wikijunior Policy]] ==

Most pages of this category are not policies. However, they all have one thing in common: '''they are obsolete'''. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 07:21, 1 August 2010 (UTC)

:From my (no doubt imperfect) understanding of the history, most of them are policy or in its close penumbra, or were in their day.  [[Wikijunior:All Books]] has sort of migrated out of the penumbra since the new title policy lapsed.  I could see moving it out to the parent category, I suppose.

:That would leave, as far as I can figure, ''one'' page here that is current rather than historical.  Historical pages should be categorized, too.  If there were several current pages scattered in a welter of historical ones, I could see separating the historical ones into a subcategory; but if there's only one current one, a simpler solution might be to give that one page a whitespace sort key so it appears at the top of the list, where it's sure to be noticed.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 12:54, 1 August 2010 (UTC)

== [[Change Issues in Curriculum and Instruction/Other Issues Worth Investigation]] ==

:To my ear, the current &quot;worth investigation&quot; does not sound right.  Non-idiomatic.  Phrasings that flow naturally for me are &quot;worth investigating&quot; and &quot;worthy of investigation&quot;.  &quot;Worth investigating&quot; is simpler.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 12:58, 1 August 2010 (UTC)

== Wikijunior in the news ==

Examiner.com has an [http://www.examiner.com/examiner/x-58002-Wiki-Edits-Examiner~y2010m8d3-Wikijunior-took-the-money-but-no-books-printed article] discussing the grant the Beck Foundation provided for the [[Wikijunior]] project and whether the money was well spent.  The author is Gregory Kohs, better known as [[User:Thekohser|Thekohser]], a longtime critic of Wikimedia Foundation practices. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:12, 4 August 2010 (UTC)

:The article has several errors (some Adrignola have already addressed IIRC in another user's talk), but I also see it as having valid criticism to how stuff works and an outright failing by WMF (if the facts are correct). On a side note I do think that the way [[User:Thekohser|Thekohser]] was blocked on this project is problematic (I'm not aware nor did I fallow actions outside of Wikibooks), and probably lead to an unnecessary escalation and actions that damage Wikijunior and its volunteers reputation. We do need critical thinking in the projects.

I could use some help with this as it is my first wikibook and I'm not sure if I'm doing it correctly. You can see what I've got so far [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A_Supplement_to_the_Texas_US_History_Textbook here].
:Hi. Please be aware that Wikibooks must have a neutral point of view (NPOV) and no original research (OR). Please avoid these in the making of this book. Also, please note that it is possible to link to the book directly. Rather than [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A_Supplement_to_the_Texas_US_History_Textbook like this], you can do it [[A Supplement to the Texas US History Textbook|like this]]. The code is &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[The page you want the text to link to|the text you want to display]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

::Just to be clear, when I write &quot;The Texas textbooks will not be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV)&quot; I am referring to the standard textbooks that Texas public schools are required to use, not the wikibook supplement. The supplement should be written from a NPOV, indeed that will be its main feature! I am not sure what wikibooks counts as NPOV and what is not. For example, I am not sure if the statement I have written describing the project currently counts as NPOV. For right now I would like to leave it as is as a useful way of describing the project to collaborators. With time I expect it will be rewritten to better reflect the project as it develops. Thank you for showing me now to use direct links.--Thomas Gokey 10:54, 10 August 2010 (UTC)
:::I see. But in fact, I didn't read that part. :) Violating our NPOV and OR policies are common mistakes that new users make, so I thought I'd warn you first.

== Wikibreak ==

When school starts I'd like to use the Wikibreak enforcer to stop me from logging in to Wikipedia and Wikibooks. Wikipedia has [[w:Wikipedia:WikiProject User scripts/Scripts/WikiBreak Enforcer|this neat script]]. Does it work on Wikibooks too?

== But I don't ''like'' the new look ==

It looks like wikibooks will switch to vector in the near future. If we get community consensus, is it possible to beg the developers to switch back to Monobook by default? [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 04:04, 13 August 2010 (UTC)
#If WB kept monobook it would be the ''only'' Wikimedia project using monobook. Not a good idea.
#There are an unexpectedly large amount of people who really like vector. I doubt you'd be able to get consensus for it even if it was just about how many editors &quot;like&quot; monobook over vector.
#Vector is (I suspect) mostly for the benefit of people who aren't really familiar with wikis, rather than for the benefit of regular editors. 
:Basically, many editors don't like the new skin because we're not used to it, and it is possible for individual editors to switch back. It really doesn't make sense for Wikibooks to keep monobook. Changes are annoying, but people get used to it. If somehow Wikibooks did have actual consensus for changing back after all the usual bureaucracy lags went through and the community had already been using vector for a few weeks, WB could probably switch back to monobook (this is just me guessing, I don't actually know this for a fact). Does anyone actually think this would be best for the project? I ''highly'' doubt it. My suggestion is to just drop the subject and go along with the change, however annoying it may be. Arguments about which things people &quot;like&quot; waste huge amounts of time and are generally completely unproductive. --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|talk]]) 07:52, 13 August 2010 (UTC)
== Incorrect URL ==

The link to a PDF file at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Non-Programmer%27s_Tutorial_for_Python_2.6 takes me to &quot;Commons:upload&quot;. The link for &quot;printable version&quot; opens a long HTML file, which is what I would have expected.

Yes - the issue is clicking the &quot;A PDF version is available.&quot; link on the right side of the screen.  This prompts the &quot;Commons:upload&quot; link, rather than downloading the PDF file.

:That PDF was moved to Commons and I believe the version of the page for logged-out users was not refreshed.

I intend to develop an illustrated alphabet textbook for little people - along the lines of 'A is for....' etc. - I'm particularly interested in trying to make the print version look as wonderful as possible, and have half an idea to be able to produce quite a few of these books focused on different interests (city / country / wildlife / people etc. etc.) - I'm very new around here, so didn't want to just rush in, and have tried to read up on guidelines, policies - if no-one objects, I'll create a starting point for my idea, and get going - join in if you think it sounds fun :-) - I'd like to finish my first one before the end of the month...... cheers, [[User:Privatemusings|Privatemusings]] ([[User talk:Privatemusings|talk]]) 02:06, 16 August 2010 (UTC)

I want it to become a featured book. :)  Thanks [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 15:27, 24 August 2010 (UTC)
== POVs in Cookbooks ==

Cookbooks always contain POVs like 'tasty', 'delicious', etc, including featured ones. Should they all be removed? [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 06:13, 25 August 2010 (UTC)

: A cookbook often describes what something tastes like, what the texture feels like, what the smell is like, and what to look for in order to understand when a stage of a recipe is complete or ready. Wikibooks' NPOV policy already allows books to include a limited amount of POVs. I think the Cookbook is a good example of where some limited POVs is needed in order to teach. Use of words like &quot;tasty&quot; and &quot;delicious&quot; may already be an attempt to be neutral, but do so at the cost of failing to be usefully descriptive. More descriptive words that help people learn what to expect are less likely to be neutral. I think if people tried to be any more neutral, the Cookbook would end up stating the obvious like &quot;Salt tastes salty&quot; (oh really?), and would still fail to provide useful descriptions that can be used to learn what to expect when tasting, testing the texture, when smelling a recipe, and what the product should look like. I think in those instances accuracy over neutrality is preferable. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 10:12, 25 August 2010 (UTC)

:This is why it is problematic hosting subprojects under existing projects.

:A cookbook isn't a textbook at all... The cookbook as a whole should, in my opinion, be structured as a guide to cooking, with the recipes as examples to practice the techniques. In other words &quot;Cookbook&quot; should be &quot;Guide to Cooking and Cooking Techniques&quot;. To a large degree it has this structure - with technique, equipment and ingredient pages - but the emphasis is always on adding more recipes, not more techniques, and the recipes don't link to the instructional content properly. A few overarching pages could be added that provided a narrative to guide the reader through the techniques and recipes in a structured way. I've often fancied giving this a go, but it's a big job and I'd want consensus on this being a better way of doing it. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 12:29, 25 August 2010 (UTC)
== Problem with external link ==

[http://ryanlai.t35.com/stuff/otherstuff/WB1.swf If you click on this text, it brings you to a 404 page]. If you click on 'go' in your browser without changing the URL, you can get straight to the t interactive quiz. Why is that?

:That's pretty weird.  I would guess it has something to do with the way the page is handled at the hosting site.  Maybe they have bad code that checks the referrer.  As an experiment, I pasted the link into a web page on my laptop using this html:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;a href=http://ryanlai.t35.com/stuff/otherstuff/WB1.swf&gt;T35&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
:That also produced a 404. I think it's a problem on their end.  Looking at the source html in that page shows that the 404 error is indeed encoded in some of the css.  I don't know css well enough to try to decipher it though. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 11:10, 27 August 2010 (UTC)

::This testing proves that the host is blocking requests to media files with an external site doing the referring.  Note that there are no problems visiting http://ryanlai.t35.com from a link, viewing the file from any page on the site using it, or as you tried above, visiting it directly with no site referring.

== Two questions ==

Hello folks!
I am sorry to disturb you, but I have only two questions. The first: can we place here books or texts written in Scots. The second question: I have a translation from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam (I see there are here many delightful English translations of it), in Scots. Can I propose it to this wiki?
Friendly,
--[[User:El Translatore|El Translatore]] ([[User talk:El Translatore|talk]]) 16:00, 28 August 2010 (UTC)

:This is an English language project.  Unless you plan to include text written in Scots in a book teaching the language, then the answer to the first question is no.  Feel free to post previously-published public domain books and texts written in Scots at the appropriate Wikisource project, however.  A for the &quot;Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam&quot;, keep in mind that we are not Wikisource and you cannot just paste in source documents and leave them.  Any posting of that sort would need to be accompanied by annotations to instruct the reader on its meaning.  See [[Wikibooks:Annotated texts]]. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 16:42, 28 August 2010 (UTC)
== Chinese Wikibooks ==

This is not important or anything, but the Chinese Wikibooks community is currently discussing to change its project name from Wikitextbooks to Wikibookhouse, to change things about namespaces and pseudo-namespaces and bookshelves, as well as its adminship discussion process. Feel free to drop by and share your thoughts. Thanks [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 06:40, 31 August 2010 (UTC)

:Shouldn't the Chinese Wikibooks still be ''Wikibooks''?  I take it this stems from the effort to represent &quot;Wikibooks&quot; in Chinese characters. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 11:58, 31 August 2010 (UTC)

::&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;chuckle* please let me explain. The Chinese Wikibooks is currently called Wikitextbooks (維基教科書), which is not so good because it's five characters long and does not represent the scope of the project accurately. So an admin suggested Wikibookhouse (維基書屋), which sounds nice and does not limit the scope to textbooks. If it is just Wikibooks, then it would be 維基書, which sounds like there's a book entitled Wikibook as there are no plurals in Chinese.

== On collapsing ==

The collapsing templates on Wikibooks does not work on IE8 at all. However, Wikipedia's collapsing works perfectly. I think Wikibooks should learn from Wikipedia and make drop-boxes that work on IE8. I am completely ignorant about the technical stuff involved. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 06:48, 31 August 2010 (UTC)

:The collapse code is maintained by [[User:Darklama|Darklama]].  It was made before Wikipedia made theirs and it also has the opposite default state from Wikipedia's.  Now we have many templates using the local code and no way to truly know of all the instances where the CSS class is used even if we wanted to change it out.  The class used here is the exact same one used at Wikipedia, so we can't leave it in place and add the classes used at Wikipedia either.  They work for me in IE8, however.  If you are making one from scratch, you need to be aware that the default state is collapsed when using &lt;tt&gt;class=&quot;collapsible&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; and that it expands only when using &lt;tt&gt;class=&quot;collapsible selected&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;.  This differs from Wikipedia, where &lt;tt&gt;class=&quot;collapsible&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; has a default state of expanded and &lt;tt&gt;class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; yields a collapsed state. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:07, 31 August 2010 (UTC)

::I just cleared the cache on the RFD page, and it seems that the collapsing is working again. However, the hide/show button isn't working too well. I clicked on the show button on the GlobalTwitcher.com nomination multiple times, and it didn't work at all. Then I tried the mass page creation nomination, which worke d right away. I clicked the GlobalTwitcher.com nomination again, and it still didn't work. This is probably IE's fault and not MW's, though.

:::I checked it out and can confirm the behavior you report.  That is another collapsing template variation.  The code I mentioned above is for tables.  The {{tl|closed}} template is using a div with the deprecated &lt;tt&gt;class=&quot;NavFrame&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; (though that runs counter to those who prefer divs to tables for formatting/layout).  Quite confusing, certainly, with two classes used in two different situations to produce the same effect, with that effect in either situation not what you'd expect coming from Wikipedia.  I notice that a change was recently made to the hide/show link that may have fixed it for tables but broke it on divs.  The div variation is also broken for Firefox, so we can't blame it on IE. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:30, 31 August 2010 (UTC)

I undid my last change since it seemed to have break things rather than fixed IE8.

== Assume good faith ==

I propose merging [[WB:AGF]] with [[WB:Be civil]]. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 10:36, 1 August 2010 (UTC)

:Can't, first you have to make WB:AGF an accepted policy. You can however merge WB:AGF and WB:Be civil in a WB:Be civil unstable branch.
:You can expect great opposition from me in making the WB:AGF a policy, read that proposal talk page to understand my position on the subject.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 11:34, 1 August 2010 (UTC)

::Whoa, Panic. That's a real [[w:WP:TLDR]] discussion. (And you've been opposing that for nearly four years! Really, that's quite impressive.) Anyway, back here. Why I am proposing merging AGF with CIVIL is because I know AGF is too minor a point to survive as an individual guideline in a small wiki such as Wikibooks. &lt;small&gt;See also an essay I recently wrote up at [[meta:Assume good faith]]. It's not the most well written essay in the world but, what the heck. :)&lt;/small&gt; I don't know if you know, but at Wikipedia AGF is probably one of the most cited Wikipedia behavioral guidelines, perhaps even more than [[w:WP:CIVIL]]. Adrignola has once reminded another user to assume good faith too. And, we even have a template about agf: {{tl|please agf}}. You see Panic, if everything were common sense, then we should probably delete [[WB:BITE]] and [[WB:BOLD]] and [[WB:NPA]] and quite a lot of other guidelines.

:::I'm going to repeat myself here, but so you understand the distinction it comes to how it is enforcible (the distinction between policies and guidelines and what makes them necessary). As you can see on the last comment of the talk page I'm not opposed to make it a guideline (even if I don't see it as extremely useful, as you say most of us do assume good faith, but we also are honest enough to understand the possibility that not everyone has good intentions, so making this a policy is indeed problematic, we can even say cynical).

::::Argh! A very dumb mistake indeed. I meant to say, the lack of AGF POLICY doesn't quite affect Wikibooks.

:::::[[WB:BITE]] (guideline), [[WB:BOLD]] (guideline), [[WB:NPA]] (policy), [[WB:CIVIL]] (policy).  [[WB:AGF]] is a draft.  Panic is right that merging to the unstable branch is the only option.  Merging a draft, or even a policy/guideline into a policy/guideline then makes the result a draft, as the changes have to be approved by the community.  Wikibooks is larger than Wikinews and Wikiversity.  I see nothing wrong with having clear distinction between ideas.  [[WB:AGF]] deals with how you feel ''others'' are behaving.  [[WB:CIVIL]] deal with how ''you'' are behaving.  As for [[WB:AGF]] not being an official guideline; keep in mind that some may be de facto guidelines.  I've not seen any drafts promoted to official guidelines/policies during my time here.

::A problem is that too often people don't move a book correctly.  Say we combined your ideas and gave reviewers (no way I'd support autoconfirmed) the ability to move subpages and suppress redirects.  You'd get less experienced people moving books, not creating the new book category, not null editing every page to put it in the new category, and suppressing redirects without first checking that all links are relative (breaking countless links and inter-book links) or leaving redirects and not having the ability to delete them soon afterwards as an administrator when links are corrected.  Just as an import is more than an import, a move is more than a move.  Moving subpages has the potential to leave up to 500 pages at a time in need of checking for double redirects and incoming links that need to be corrected.  Moving that many pages at a time also corresponds with an administrator's ability to suppress their edits from recent changes. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:54, 17 August 2010 (UTC)

== Cite button ==

On Wikipedia, for both the monobook and vector toolbars, there is a cite button which will help users cite sources with {{tl|cite book}}, {{tl|cite news}}, {{tl|cite web}} etc. This can be enabled in the preferences. I'd love to see such a feature on Wikibooks as well. Does anyone else agree with me? And how can we request this?

:To get some standardization, I had updated the documentation for those templates and imported some that were missing.  {{tl|Refbegin}} and {{tl|Refend}} are also now available for bibliographies, with {{tl|Reflist}} there for footnotes.

::@DL: Yes, but it's still nice to have a cite button, isn't it?
::@Adrignola: Um, I don't think simple templates like Reflist need a button, but cite web, cite book, cite news etc have a lot of parameters, so it's good to have them automated by a cite button. I only want a button that can standardise the ''formats'' of books - whether books should list refs at the end of books, or at the end of each module as inline citations, is the book contributors' choice.

:::I see it as a controversial issue that has a good probability to cause unnecessary disruption and confusion (we are not Wikipedia but even experienced users often forget that).

::: Where to place citations is just one choice that makes up the style that books can decide. The format of citations can also vary and is another choice that makes up the style that books can decide. A cite button here would either favor one format over another or would need to be able to know which format a book uses in order to use the correct format for each book. I think you won't be able to get any consensus that Wikibooks should have a standardized format for citations in all books and what the format must be, let alone that a button should be added. A button that favored one citation format over another would promote and facilitate the practice and adoption of one citation format over another. I believe promoting and facilitating the adoption of one practice over another is something that Wikibooks has tried to avoid doing without community consensus that one practice should be favored over another. I think a citation button shouldn't be added unless the Wikibooks community is willing to adopt a practice of using a specific citation format for all books. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 05:38, 21 August 2010 (UTC)

::::Darklama, I fully accept that it is impossible to reach a consensus on how to standardise citation formats. I won't mind if there's a cite button for the Havard format as well, even though AFAIK they haven't made one yet. It is just that I want a button for the cite web, cite book templates etc, which I can use if I wish. It would be ideal if we had a button for each citation format, but I don't think the developers have time to do that, so the only button we can use now is for the most popular format, which is cite web, cite book, cite news etc. At WP, although the templates are encouraged, they are not compulsory. Why are they encouraged? Because they are more popular than the other formats. That's why we can choose whether to use it or not. BTW, if this doesn't pass (and it probably won't), is there a script I can put into my monobook.js or monobook.css to use it? Thanks [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 08:36, 21 August 2010 (UTC)

::::I do not agree with Panic and Darklama above.  A button will not make citations a requirement.  Technical measures are not a replacement and do not supersede policy or guidelines.  The only variation in citation templates is between the Harvard citation templates and the Cite templates.  All the Cite templates call [[Template:Citation]] and so follow the same pattern.  If you want your own style, you're free to not use the button or existing templates and simply use {{tl|Reflist}} and/or {{tl|Refbegin}}/{{tl|Refend}} for ''formatting''.  Making it easier to produce citations is not a problem and I'm not going to complain if we find that books become better sourced! &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:12, 21 August 2010 (UTC)

::::: Books are much larger than a single article. I think the use of bibliographies to cite sources is no surprise because using inline citations like Wikipedia would require a lot more work. I'm not sure what else you could mean by &quot;become better sourced&quot;. There are [[w:Citation#Citation styles|citation styles]] unique to practically every subject. Just because there are currently only citation templates for 2 styles don't mean it couldn't grow to be over 100. Wikipedia has over [[w:Category:Citation templates|100 templates]] just for one citation style. If this is really about making citations easier to produce, I think some sort of Citation Gadget where you could pick a style from a drop menu and fill in some fields with info and the gadget would generate the citation for you would be better. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:38, 21 August 2010 (UTC)
== Book page top header ==

Currently the top header of every book page is set up like this:
{{hiddenh1|Book name/Page name}}
&lt;div id=&quot;siteSub&quot;&gt;From Wikibooks, the open-content textbooks collection&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;bodyContent&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;contentSub&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;subpages&quot;&gt;&amp;lt; [[Book name]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
I think this is probably not the best setup. The top header should probably only display the page name, and the tagline and book link should probably be merged into one line, indicating that the page is part of whatever book as well as part of Wikibooks. Thoughts? --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|talk]]) 00:25, 18 August 2010 (UTC)

Or the whole thing could be done with JavaScript... --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|talk]]) 01:03, 18 August 2010 (UTC)


The name of the page isn't standalone information, like the name of a Wikipedia article.  The title of the book is an important part of identifying the page.  The proposed alternative design would bury the lead, so to speak, making the book title much less prominent, harder to extract, and less closely connected to the rest of the page name (and harder to reconnect, because the book title comes ''after'' the rest of the page name); and it would increase the complexity of the administrative text at the top of the page.

It can, occasionally, get hard to read the page name in the current format when it has multiple fields that each have several words.  For example:
{{hiddenh1|A-level Applied Science/Energy Transfer Systems/Circulatory and Respiratory Systems}}
Whether that's readable may actually depend on how wide your browsing window is; my ancient screen isn't wide enough to put it all on one line.  So, at least for my screen width, and ''in this case'', it might be better if there were a linebreak, and maybe some indentation, after each slash.  Maybe something like this:
{{hiddenh1|A-level Applied Science/&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ensp;Energy Transfer Systems/&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ensp;Circulatory and Respiratory Systems}}
I'm somewhat dubious of this for most books, though, as it makes things take up a lot more vertical space, and may be needless in cases where it would all fit on one line (which depends on screen/window size) and the fields are short.  To explore that question, here's another page that I looked at when trying to find a long complex page name; &amp;mdash; from the same book, no less.
{{hiddenh1|A-level Applied Science/Colour Chemistry/Paint/Solvents}}
It's unclear to me that this really needs to be broken onto multiple lines.  A more extreme case is

{{hiddenh1|Conlang/Intermediate/History/Common sound changes}}
versus
{{hiddenh1|Conlang/&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ensp;Intermediate/&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ensp;History/&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ensp;Common sound changes}}
Admittedly, I do find it easier to read the multi-line version.  The question is whether that advantage is worth the disadvantage in vertical space lost.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 13:27, 18 August 2010 (UTC)
:I am extremely confused as to why the slash was kept in every one of your examples. I don't know whether the header should just show the book title, or just show the page title, or show the book title with the page title as a subheader or vice versa, or if the header should be removed entirely, or whatever, but keeping the BOOKNAME/PAGENAME looks ridiculous. --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|talk]]) 22:47, 23 August 2010 (UTC)

I use to use a javascript that did something like:

{{hiddenh6|[[Conlang]] &gt; [[Conlang/Intermediate|Intermediate]] &gt; [[Conlang/Intermediate/History|History]]}}
Combining the page title with the navigation and hiding the tag line. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:59, 18 August 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Checklist for installation problems ==
=== introduction ===

If you followed the installation-instructions and the results are not as expected, this could have a number of reasons. A large number. Before you post a mail to the OpenClinica-mailinglist, saying &quot;my installation did not work: why not?&quot; it is good to check the list of points below. It helps a lot if you can narrow down the problem, for example to &quot;the creation of the Postgres-db was not succesfull&quot;.

=== check that you have the correct version of OpenClinica ===
The [https://community.openclinica.com/project/openclinica Download OpenClinica page] offers several different versions of OpenClinica.  If you are just starting off, you will most likely want the latest stable version that looks like OpenClinica-n.n.n (the regular OpenClinica release), rather than OpenClinica-ws-n.n.n (the web services release) or OpenClinica-ws-caBIG-n.n.n (web services with caBIG).

=== check the versions of the software you are running ===
Compare the versions of the software you are running to the requirements listed in the requirements section of the [https://community.openclinica.com/project/openclinica Download OpenClinica page].  Sometimes the latest versions of software (Tomcat or Postgres) are not compatible with the latest version of OpenClinica (e.g. OpenClinica 3.1.4.x isn't compatible with Tomcat 7+ or Postgres 9.0+).

==== non-obvious effects of using non-supported versions ====
Even though your installation appears to be running OK, there can be some bugs that are related to using a non-supported version that aren't apparent until after you've built your first study.

For example with OpenClinica 3.1.4 and 3.1.3.1 (and presumably earlier versions), using Tomcat 6.0.36 instead of the recommended 6.0.32 results the display of an inactive 'Begin New Thread' link in the discrepancy notes pop-up window, both on Linux and Windows systems ([https://mailman.openclinica.com/pipermail/users/2013-August/008634.html see this mail list thread]). This bug prevents more than one discrepancy note being (easily) added to each item in the study, and therefore prevents more than one edit being saved for an item on a CRF that was marked complete, where 'Forced Reason for Change During Administrative Data Entry' is active for the study.

=== check Tomcat is running OK ===

To check this, open a web browser, such as Firefox or Internet Explorer. Type the address of the server you installed  Tomcat on, followed by the portnumber you specified. If you took all defaults this is port 8080. You can use ip-address or the name, so http://www.myserver.org:8080 or http://[ip-address]:8080.

If you installed Tomcat on your local machine, use http://localhost:8080

You should now see a page of the Apache Software Foundation saying &quot;If you're seeing this page via a web browser, it means you've setup Tomcat successfully. Congratulations!&quot;

If you don't see such a page, check your Tomcat log files, you may see an error about Tomcat not being able to allocate memory.  You can either reduce the amount Tomcat is trying to allocate (e.g. reduce the Maximum memory pool value on Windows), or increase the amount available.

=== check Tomcat recognizes OpenClinica ===

To check if Tomcat recognizes OpenClinica correctly, you can use the Tomcat manager-page. But before you can access this page, you must add a user with the tomcat-manager-role to the file tomcat-users.xml This file is located under the Tomcat-directory structure in conf/tomcat-users.xml 
Add two lines to it: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;role rolename=&quot;manager&quot;/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;user username=&quot;tomcat&quot; password=&quot;s3cret&quot; roles=&quot;manager&quot;/&gt;

Shutdown and startup Tomcat. Go to the default page, described above, http://www.myserver.org:8080 or localhost:8080
If you are on the first page of Tomcat, click on the link in the lefthand corner labeled &quot;Tomcat Manager&quot;. In the page that opens, you see a list of all applications. In this list you should see an entry for &quot;OpenClinica 3.0&quot;

=== check OpenClinica is running ===

In the Tomcat Web Application Manager, described above, go to the line with &quot;OpenClinica&quot; and check the third column &quot;Running&quot;: this should be &quot;true&quot;. If it is &quot;false&quot;, click &quot;Start&quot; in the fourth column. If this is the first time for OpenClinica to run, give it time! Tomcat has to go through the archive file, the war, and deploy it. On a slow machine this can take 10 minutes or more.
If the status of OpenClinica is True/Running, then click on the link if the left column to get the OpenClinica login-screen.

=== check Postgres is running ===

For Linux type &quot;ps -u postgres&quot; and if there is output, you're OK.
For Windows, goto Configuration-System-Services and look for PostgreSQL and then check the status.

=== check user clinica and database openclinica exist in Postgres ===

Open psql. Type &quot;\du&quot;. You get a listing of all users and (super)user &quot;clinica&quot; should be on it.
Next type &quot;\l&quot; This will give a list of all databases and one of them should be &quot;openclinica&quot;, owner &quot;clinica&quot;, encoding &quot;UTF8&quot;

=== check your datainfo.properties ===
This is the obvious one: check every line you changed and/or commented out!

=== Writing a mail to the OpenClinica community ===
After you've gone through the above list and you know better what to ask, sum up the specifications of your system and the versions of: 
# Operating System 
# Tomcat 
# Postgres/Oracle
# OpenClinica 
# everything else you think is important

Then shutdown Tomcat. Go to your log file directory and delete all files. Now startup Tomcat, wait until the error happens again. Shutdown Tomcat. Zip all the log files. As a last step: add datainfo.properties (webapps\OpenClinica\WEB-INF\classes) to the zip-file.  You may need to remove any senstivie information from this file, such as database username and password.

Now you are ready to write a mail to the mailing list, with your installation-problem, your specifications, the things you checked and the zip with the log files.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Bamidbar / In the Wilderness   Numbers 1:1 to 4:20
1 Samuel 20: 18-42;   Luke 2:1-52;  1 Corinthians 12:12-31

Bamidbar/Numbers details many of the encounters that the Ancient Israelites had in their wilderness experience and various statutes and decrees that the Lord gives them as they begin to form a more cohesive national identity and prepare themselves to take the Promised Land.   As you read these first four chapters of the book of Numbers, you get a sense that the Holy One is intimately involved with all the details of just how He wants His people to function as they leave the bondage of Egypt and head toward the Land of Promise through this deserted area. 

Numbers/Bamidbar 1:1-4
Yahweh spoke to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai, in the Tent of Meeting, on the first of the second, in the second year after their exodus from the land of Egypt, saying: Take a census of the entire assembly of the Children of Yisrael according to their families, according to their fathers’ household, by number of the names, every male according to their head count, from twenty years of age and up – everyone who goes out to the legion in Yisrael-you shall count them according to their legions, you and Aaron.  And with you shall be one man from each tribe; a man who is a leader of his father’s household. 


&lt;u&gt;The Census&lt;/u&gt;

This Torah portion, Bamidbar,&quot;In the Wilderness,” begins the Book of Numbers, commonly called so because the first few chapters record the census of the tribes of Israel, with the exception of the priestly tribe of Levi.  It is here where we discover conclusively that the tribe of Levi has been chosen for unique status among the tribes. This was to be a census done of the Israelites for a specific accounting of those able to go out to war as soldiers. This is, without a doubt, a necessity so the leaders of Israel can evaluate the competency and power of their forces.

As the numbers of fighting men were counted there was no doubt some hesitancy and concern, if not discouragement, on behalf of the leaders of Israel. They knew God was leading them in the near future to conquer the Promised Land and had probably heard rumors about the enemies that awaited them.  Forming them into an organised unit transformed them from a band of runaway slaves into a cohesive functioning unit for divine service.

The Body of Believers is a spiritual army which has the purpose of advancing the Kingdom of Heaven. It is an offensive organism which cannot invade the enemy’s territory without the enemy resisting. Do you view yourself as a spiritual warrior? We must be advancing against the enemy’s strongholds (the world, flesh and the devil) wherever and whenever possible both individually and corporately.  We should not be discouraged by the smallness of numbers as compared to the enemy, but remember “greater is He that is in us than he that is in the world”  (1 John 4:4)

And also let us remember the promises of His provision and our eternal reward, as well as the great cloud of witnesses of those who have gone before us that are watching our performance and dependant upon us to finish the course.so they also may enter into their inheritance.  Most of all, remember He who endured to the end and conquered every assailing force that we might be victorious. He dwells in the midst of us just as He did in the wilderness Tabernacle. The Israelites actually stood round about the Tabernacle and guarded His Presence in their midst.  In the same way we are to guard this treasure which we have in this earthly vessel, that it is not overpowered by the forces from without.

In Luke 14:26-34 in parable form, Yeshua tells us to take account of our resources personally to assess our strength to withstand the enemy.  This assessment is based on whether the enemy has grounds in our life or whether we have taken up our cross and forsaken all to follow Him. Engagement in warfare must be based on an appropriate strategy.

The war in which we are engaged is against the powers of darkness which war against our soul, either directly or indirectly to cause us to lose the battle against him and his device against us.   The weapons of our warfare are not natural - that is, we do not fight this battle in our own resources of will-power, greater effort etc. but we tale the spiritual weapons assigned for this purpose.   2 Corinthians 10:4;  Ephesians 6:10-20

Our warfare then is against the fleshly lusts within us over which our enemy can exercise dominion (James 4: 1-),  which lusts “war against our souls” (1 Peter 2:11).   For this reason, Paul said that he kept his body (his fleshly appetites) under control.   “I discipline my body and bring it into subjection”   (1 Corinthians 9:27)
“You therefore my son, be strong in the grace that is in Messiah Yeshua.  .. .. ..   You therefore must endure hardness as a good soldier of Yeshua the Messiah.  No one engaged in warfare entangles himself in the affairs of this life that he may please him who enlisted him as a soldier.”    2 Timothy 2: 1- 4
Discipline over our life is essential in order to be counted as a ‘man of war’ in His army going out to conquer the land.

&lt;u&gt;The Levites&lt;/u&gt;

Yahweh distinguished the tribe of Levi for a special position of service because of their faithfulness to Yahweh at the golden calf incident. Yahweh honors those who serve him. For their zeal in defending Israel from idolatry they were given charge over the Tabernacle and its treasures. Though they were thusly honored, they were the least tribe in that they were not given a land inheritance, and thus did not have the means to become wealthy. Furthermore, they were pressed into Yahweh’s ministerial service with little recompense. This is the price one has to pay to be close to the holy things of Yahweh and to be high up in his service (Matt. 23:11).  Are we willing to walk this difficult path, if called to do so?  Are we willing to lose our life for Yahweh’s sake? (Matt. 10:39)

Yahweh demanded the best years (ages 30-50) of the Levites to be employed as servants in the Tabernacle. Are we giving Yahweh the best of your life, or are we giving him the leftovers? Are we pursuing our own interests now and planning to serve him in the waning years of our lives?  

Have we taken into consideration how these type of choices will effect our heavenly rewards?

&lt;u&gt;The Calling of the Ministry&lt;/u&gt;

The census of the very Levitical families is taken after the men solicited for the army and the various responsibilities assigned to individuals. The Holy One is extremely interested in the details of life. He has a role for each of us to play as we seek to honor, worship and praise Him. This is especially true of those among the children of God who have been called into His kingdom at this hour.
The Apostle Paul was describing to the Corinthians the importance of each priestly member of the assembly.
‘But just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is Messiah. For by one Spirit we were all immersed into one body, whether Yehudim (Jews) or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all given to drink of one Spirit. For also the body is not one member, but many.&quot;

In this passage to the Believers at Corinth, the Apostle Paul relates the need for the Body of the Messiah to be composed of a variety of people with all sorts of unique gifting.  Just like the different tribes had their functions and positions and the different Levite families had their specific duties, so does the living ‘called out ones’ have their individual gifts and responsibilities. As you read through this passage, you are reminded that due to the unique nature of the body, we are to give those who have less ability greater honor.  In so doing, Paul is using body parts in an analogous way to communicate the imperative to give even the hidden organs honor.  Even though we do not see the vital organs that are hidden beneath the surface of the skin, without them, we would not be able to live. (1 Corinthians 12:22-27).  So also we need to appreciate that those whose function we do not see, are still vital to the Body.

We ought to think in terms of the whole Body and its welfare without losing sight of the individual.  As each person gives of himself and his talents for the kingdom, the rest of the Body prospers and the one who gives partakes of the overall blessing.  The individual ought to seek the good of the corporate congregation, and the corporate congregation ought to seek the good of the individual.  Thereby all are blessed and provided for.   (Ephesians 4:16; 1 Cor. 12:12-26)
A good leader seeks the welfare of all those who are under him and not certain personalities or giftings in his people.

&lt;u&gt;The Tribal Elders&lt;/u&gt;

The names of the twelve men who would &quot;stand with&quot; Moshe (Moses, meaning &quot;drawn out&quot;) has spiritual significance for us today.  To be called a son of someone indicates you have their traits, or character. The tribe indicates the overall nature of a person and the area of their giftings.  These were men that were the 'head' of their tribes, men of character, men of responsibility, capable of caring for the 'flock'  (Matthew 24:45-47).

Numbers 1:16 These were the renowned of the congregation, princes of the tribes of their fathers, heads of thousands in Israel.  Notice that these were captains of thousands, not common people.  Each was fulfilling the place of responsibility as a general in the army of Yahweh.   Rashi, the Medieval Jewish Torah commentator, notes that the sons of Aaron are called Moses’ offspring, showing that when we teach Torah to someone we become their spiritual father.  The more we pour of ourselves into someone else the more we will be replenished from above. 


&lt;u&gt;The Twelve Tribes Insignia&lt;/u&gt;

Reuben’s banner was red and its insignia was that of a duda’im (mandrakes), a type of the flowers he brought to his mother   (Genesis 30:14-15). 

Simeon’s banner was green with an embroidered representation of the City of Schechem. 

Levi’s banner was white, black, and red with an Urim and Thummim (Exodus 28:30)

Judah’s banner was a jade blue with a lion.  Judah was the leader of the twelve tribes and was positioned toward the east, the direction from which the light of the world.  It was a position of honor in the four formations, as Judah led by example. 

Issachar’s banner was blue-black with a sun and moon.  Issachar was famous for its scholars who calculated the orbits of the heavenly bodies to fix the calendar (I Chronicles12:32).   Issachar was positioned behind Judah, as they are considered the tribe becoming the judges who would make all legal decisions in Torah.  

Zebulon’s banner was white with a ship and mainly pursued business ( considered the tribe of wealth) and supported the people of Yissachar in their work. 

Dan’s banner color was sapphire with a eagle. 

Gad’s banner was gray with a battalion of soldiers.  

Naftali’s banner was pale red with a doe. 

Asher’s banner was the color of flaming olive oil with an olive tree. 

Joseph’s tribes were jet black with Ephraim’s banner having an ox, and Manesseh’s a re’em (Deuteronomy 33:17). 
Benjamin’s banner was a mixture of all the other colors of the twelve tribes with a wolf as its insignia (Genesis 49:27). 


&lt;u&gt;The Banners of the Lead Tribes&lt;/u&gt;

Each tribe had its own distinctiveness characterized by its own unique banner which was the colour of its stone in the breastplate of the High Priest.   The Israelites travelled in the wilderness in four groups, each group consisting of three tribes, and each with its own banner which comprised the colours of each of the three tribes.  The entire system of banners was set up through Yaakov (Jacob) according to Rabbinic tradition.  When Yaakov asked to be buried in Eretz Yisrael he taught his children the marching formation for carrying his coffin according to their prophetic roles in the kingdom which became their future marching formation.    Each son that Yaakov addressed in second person was to be a leader of a camp. “Revuen, YOU are my firstborn”, “Yehuda, YOU your brothers will acknowledge”, “Dan... YOUR salvation”, “Yosef... the God of YOUR father... blesses YOU”.  The ensignia on each banner was according to the prophetic emblem given them in Genesis 49 by Yaakov.  Yahweh encourages pageantry as well as (cultural) uniqueness among his children.   We do not all have to be carbon copies of one another to be members of the Body of Messiah.  Some of us are hands, feet, noses, mouths, etc.  (1 Corinthians 12)  If each know their placement there can be order and unity in the Body. 

On the EAST we have Judah, Issachar and Zebulun
On the SOUTH we have Reuben, Simeon and Gad
On the WEST we have Ephraim , Benjamin and Mannaseh
On the NORTH we have Dan Naphtali and Asher

With regard to the placement of the tribes around the Tabernacle The Stone Edition Chumash comments: God patterned the formations of Yisrael after that of His own Heavenly Throne of Glory: The Throne is in the center and is surrounded by four animals, as it were.  On earth, the Tabernacle represents the Throne, surrounded by the four formations.  Judah, as the leader of the tribes, was assigned to the east, the direction from which light comes to the world.  With him were Issachar, the tribe of Torah, and Zebulun, the tribe of wealth and the others north, south and west of the Tabernacle. (p.  733).   The banners of the four major encampments corresponded to the four ‘faces’ of the mystical chariot mentioned in the beginning of Ezekiel. These four ‘faces’ are fundamental Divine attributes. Thus each encampment related to a particular Divine attribute.  
Notice Revelation 4:7 where the four heavenly creatures around Yahweh’s throne are described to be like: a lion, a calf, a man and an eagle.  This corresponds to the four lead tribes and their corresponding banners which have the same spiritual significance. 


&lt;u&gt;The Tribes in Formation&lt;/u&gt;

Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, The Children of Yisrael shall encamp, each man by his banner according to the insignias of their fathers’ household, at a distance surrounding the Tent of Meeting shall they encamp. Bamidbar 2:1-2

At a distance of no more than two thousand cubits from the Tent of Meeting, the Israelites set camp. If it had been any further, the people would have been forbidden to walk to the Tent of Meeting on Sabbath to pray and listen to the teachings of Torah. 

Each man camped according to the insignias of his father’s household.   Each of the four tribal formations had a distinct identifiable colored banner.   In addition, each of the individual tribes had its own flag with insignia that identified its own unique characteristic.   Each individual tribe’s flag was the same color as that of its stone worn on the High Priest’s (Kohen Gadol’s) breastplate. 

The formations of Yisrael were patterned after the Heavenly Throne of Glory:   The Throne, represented here on earth by Yahweh’ Ark of the Covenant, was to be centrally located and surrounded by the four formations of tribes. The sanctuary being in the center represented the fact that Yahweh is the center of His people.  He is at the center of holiness and is the source of life, blessing, and empowerment.  “Every individual was located in relation to the Ark and the Tabernacle. The Tabernacle was the first thing one saw on leaving home and the first thing one looked for on returning home. Gradually, this physical centrality must have led to the Ark’s gaining a central place in the Israelite soul” (Etz Chayim, New York: The Jewish Publication Society, 2001, p. 774). Like our ancestors, each of us sees God from a slightly different perspective, depending upon where we are encamped in life, but God remains the focal point, our anchor and compass in bad times and good.  To picture the magnificence of Yahweh’ Glory as the tribes of Israel were arrayed to move forward with the Tent of Meeting centered between them, Ezekiel 10:9-11 says, 
“And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was as the color of a beryl stone.  And as for their appearances they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.  When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place where the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went. ”

In the middle of the Yisraelite encampment were the Levites and the sanctuary. Surrounding this center were the 12 Tribes. The image of the Yisraelite camp is like a wheel with many spokes all leading to one hub. The tribes had a specific order and method of movement.  Everyone “knowing their place” fostered harmony among the people.  Each tribe was placed to face the Tabernacle as the centre, the focus of their existence so that none would focus on their tribal identity to the exclusion of the other tribes and their function around the tabernacle.  They were to develop their individual abilities for the service of the heavenly vision before them.   The Tribal positions being around the Tabernacle kept it at the very center of the camp. (See The Torah: A Modern Commentary, edited by W. Gunther Plaut, New York: UAHC Press, 1981, p. 1,027.) As the focus of the people’s attention, the Ark and the Tabernacle were powerful symbols of God’s Presence. 

If you diagram out on paper the arrangement of the tribal camps around the Tabernacle by their numbers on the north, south, east and west the shape formed is a ‘cross’  with the Tabernacle in the center.  Notice the cross within the cross - Yeshua is the One within that forms the pattern for our gathering together unto Him and the pattern for our life which is structured around Him.
Yahweh’s glorious presence (anointing) is a shadow-picture of Yeshua hanging on the cross and was found at the very center of the Tabernacle. This needs to be the focal point of everything in our lives as well

Yahweh is intimately concerned about the actual placement of the different tribes around the tabernacle or tent of meeting.  Since He knew that this temporary dwelling was going to be on the road for some time, He conveyed the details about how the sons of Yisrael can move with Him in their midst, in an orderly martial led array.  Just contemplating nearly three million souls moving through the desert with order, according to tribal identification.


&lt;u&gt;The Established Order&lt;/u&gt; 

When being transported the Ark of the Covenant was covered with a tachash skin which, according to rabbinic tradition was an unusually beautiful color of turquoise blue made from the hide of a now extinct animal.    According to Stone Edition Chumash, this striking color of blue invited one to keep Yahweh’s Torah-commandments by clothing them in physical beauty thus showing that obedience to them would be enjoyable (p.  745). 

Can we honestly say that obeying Yahweh, keeping his commands, is inviting and enjoyable, or is it a burden?  If the latter then you need to examine your heart before Yahweh and check your motives for obeying him.  In 1 John 5:1-3 we read:  “Whosoever believes that Yeshua is the Messiah is born of God: and every one that loves him that begat loves him also that is begotten of him.  By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep His commandments.  For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments: and His commandments are not grievous [burdensome, severe, cruel, heavy]. “

The Apostle John clearly states that obedience to Torah is centered on love — a love relationship between man and his Creator.  John, in his Gospel, records Yeshua, the Living Torah-Word of Elohim, saying, If you love me, keep my Torah-commandments (John 14:15). 

The cherubim form a position at the gate of Eden and upon the cover of the Ark of the Covenant and their reference in the book of Revelations appear to provide a defense and protection from attack or encroachment.   Cherubim were evidently connected with vindicating the Holiness of Yahweh as violated by sin, while seraphim, upon which the mercy seat rested, dealt with the uncleanness in the people of Yahweh.   But the cherubim moved with the four wheels, the formations of the tribes of Yisrael.   The wheels, which were the Children of Yisrael set in array as they camped and moved through the wilderness resembled a wheel; but their appearance was also as that of a beryl stone.   A beryl stone is blue-green in appearance, turquoise, and with the Children of Yisrael numbering so many as they moved and camped in the Wilderness, they appeared as a sea. 

There was an order of holiness.  The regular tribes were at the outside and kept at “some distance” (Numbers 2:2).  The rabbis says this was one mile.  Later when the Israelites marched behind the ark the distance was 2,000 cubits (3,000 feet or about 1 kilometer).  The Levites and Priests were closer.   The greatest honor was on the east side, where the gates into the Tabernacle faced.  Moses, Aaron, and the priests camped on this side. 

Yahweh is an God of order, not confusion.  Each member of the Body of Yeshua has a position, responsibility and a role to play in the proper and orderly functioning of the “camp”.  What is your role in the Body of Messiah? Are you functioning in your gifting and calling? How are we serving and how are we helping to advance Yahweh’s kingdom is something to consider? (Read Rom.  12:5-8 and 1 Corinthians 12). 

Are you a spectator or a participating member in the Body of Believers? 

With disobedience comes a withdrawal of His Presence.  The Glory of Yahweh is pictured as departing in stages in Ezekiel 10th chapter.  With Judah’s final deportation into the land of Babylon, Yahweh’ Glory departs from the Tabernacle.  But as we begin to reassembled ourselves today as the twelve tribes of Yisrael, Yahweh’ Glory shall return with great power and Glory through His Son Messiah Yeshua.  There will be an order of holiness also in the Messianic Age.  Our treasure in heaven may very well have something to do with this.  All the sheep of Yisrael need to come into order and fulfill their function in the kingdom.

The official DVD-Video specifications are only available to those willing to sign non-disclosure agreements and pay hefty licence fees; nevertheless, a lot of dedicated people have managed to reverse-engineer nearly all of the format, to the point where it has become possible to create Free Software authoring tools like [http://dvdauthor.sourceforge.net/ DVDAuthor] and playback tools like [http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/groups/dvd/ Ogle] and [http://www.videolan.org/ VLC].

==Target Audience==
This book is aimed at a technical audience; anybody working on software for authoring or playing DVD-Video, or otherwise messing about with DVD-Video, who needs to have a detailed understanding of the data layout.

==Terminology==
The terminology and abbreviations used follow what seems to be standard when talking about DVD-Video. Thus, a “chapter” is referred to as a “Part of Title” and abbreviated “PTT” (though it is explained that this happens to mean a “chapter”). There are also various data structure field names that seem to be standard.

      <comment>/* Subpictures */ widescreen considerations moved to subpictures detail page</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is about the specific use of DVD discs to hold DVD-Video content. Information on the lower-level structure of a DVD disc can be found [[w:DVD|elsewhere]]; here we will concentrate only on the directory- and file-level structures necessary for DVD-Video.

The ''titles'' (content) on a DVD-Video disc are stored in [[w:MPEG|MPEG]] format. In addition to this, a disc will typically have one or more ''menu'' screens with ''buttons'' marked on them, linked to each other and to the titles. You can navigate around the buttons in a menu by using the up, down, left and right arrow buttons on your player remote, and ''select'' a menu button by pressing the button marked “OK” or “Enter” on the remote, normally located in the middle of the arrow buttons.

There will usually be a “main menu” which automatically comes up when you put the disc in the player (after initial company logos, copyright warnings and other guff that the distributors insist on inflicting on us), and that you can return to with the “Top Menu” button on the remote. Other remote buttons labelled “Menu”, “Subtitle”, “Audio”, “Angle” or “Chapter” may bring up other special menus, depending on the disc.

==Disc Structure Versus Title Structure==
One thing that will strike you about the DVD-Video data structures is that they tend to offer a variety of ways of doing what amounts to the same thing. For example, how menus and titles are grouped on disc is one thing, whereas how they appear to the user (linked to each other by the buttons in the menus) can be very different.

==Subpictures==
DVD-Video also allows for subtitles. These are called ''subpictures'', because they are represented, not as text, but as bitmaps overlaid on the video. They can thus represent arbitrary fonts, languages, writing systems etc. And they don’t even have to be text. However they are stored as two bits per pixel, thus allowing for only four different colours (transparent areas where the video shows through also count as a colour).

Subpictures are also used to implement highlighting of buttons in menus. In this situation, their display is normally “forced” (i.e. unconditional), so the user doesn’t have to turn them on. In fact it doesn’t make sense for the user ''not'' to see the buttons on the menus.

==Interaction Commands==
Menu buttons can do more than just bring up a title or another menu; there is a whole ''virtual machine language'' that is understood by an interpreter built into the DVD player, that can implement quite complicated interactive behaviours.

==Evil Stuff==
===Region Coding===
Commercial DVD-Video discs are commonly ''region-coded'', while the consumer players are ''region-locked'' to only play discs coded with the same region. For example, North America is Region 1, Europe is Region 2, etc. This was to allow the distributors to release discs first into their most important markets, while taking their time over making them available elsewhere, without the worry that somebody might ship the discs to the latter markets and bypass the “official” distributors in the process.

Nevertheless, region-unlocked players are commonly available in many parts of the world, and in some places it is actually ''illegal'' to prevent customers from unlocking their players.

===Copy Protection===
Commercial DVD-Video discs are commonly encrypted with the ''Content-Scrambling System'' (CSS). The idea was that makers of player hardware and software would only be given access to the encryption keys if they signed an agreement to ensure that the decrypted video could not be easily recorded or copied by other devices or software.

Unfortunately, the CSS encryption was badly designed, and many people who did not sign such agreements were soon able to break it. Regretfully there are still legal restrictions in some jurisdictions on the distribution of CSS-decryption software, but all the good Free Software DVD-Video players are able to use the decryption library once you find it and install it (wink, wink).

CSS-encrypted discs have a special area containing decryption keys, which is only accessible via a special handshake between the DVD drive and the player software, details of which are not publicly known. Writable DVD blanks that ordinary consumers can buy do not have provision for this special area (and in any case off-the-shelf DVD writers cannot write it). So at this time Free Software cannot create such discs.

===Prohibited User Operations===
Remember I mentioned above the stuff that commonly starts playing on commercial discs as soon as you put them in the player? What makes them doubly annoying is that you often cannot skip or fast-forward over them.

This is done by specifying that certain “user operations” (skip, fast-forward, pause/still etc) are ''prohibited'' over certain areas of the disc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Summary of Specification Limits=
The following limits are imposed by the DVD-Video spec.

Each title can have one video stream, up to 8 audio streams, and up to 32 subpicture streams.

There can be no more than 99 titlesets, no more than 99 menus in the VMG or a titleset, and no more than 99 titles in a titleset.

Each title may be made up of up to 999 PGCs. Each PGC may consist of up to 255 programs. The pre- and post-sections of a PGC put together can contain no more than 128 VM instructions.

Since there is only one VOB file (&lt;tt&gt;VIDEO_TS.VOB&lt;/tt&gt;) in the VMG, the total amount of video in the VMG menus must fit into 1073709056 bytes (524272 sectors of 2kiB each). In each titleset, all the menu video must fit in the first VOB (&lt;tt&gt;VTS_&lt;/tt&gt;''nn''&lt;tt&gt;_0.VOB&lt;/tt&gt;), so is limited to the same amount.

Up to 9 different angles are allowed for multi-angle.

There can be up to 36 buttons on-screen at once for narrowscreen footage, but only 12 at once for widescreen, because of the need to provide up to 3 different versions of the subpicture stream, one for use on widescreen TVs and the other two on narrowscreen.

      <comment>/* Physical Layout */ correct ordering: .BUP comes after all .VOB files</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">If you look at a DVD-Video disc on a PC, you will see a common directory structure: at the top level, a directory called &lt;tt&gt;VIDEO_TS&lt;/tt&gt;, and probably also one called &lt;tt&gt;AUDIO_TS&lt;/tt&gt;. The latter will have nothing in it; it is part of the structure of DVD-Audio discs, which never seemed to become very popular, details of which are not publicly-known.

Inside the &lt;tt&gt;VIDEO_TS&lt;/tt&gt; directory, you will see a bunch of files with names ending in &lt;tt&gt;.IFO&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;.BUP&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;.VOB&lt;/tt&gt;. The (typically large) &lt;tt&gt;.VOB&lt;/tt&gt; files contain the actual MPEG-format content, while the (much smaller) &lt;tt&gt;.IFO&lt;/tt&gt; (“info”) files contain information about the menu and title structure. The &lt;tt&gt;.BUP&lt;/tt&gt; (“backup”) files are copies of the corresponding &lt;tt&gt;.IFO&lt;/tt&gt; files with the same name, meant to be kept on a physically separate area of the disc, to provide some robustness in the event of physical damage.

Menus and titles in DVD-Video are grouped into ''domains''. There can be one or more ''titleset domains'' (VTS), and there will also always be a ''video manager'' (VMG) domain. Differences between the two:
* Titlesets can contain both menus and titles, while the VMG can only contain menus.
* VM jump commands in the VMG can directly address menus and titles in any titleset, while those in titlesets can only address menus and titles within the same titleset or the VMG.

The VMG is kept in the files &lt;TT&gt;VIDEO_TS.IFO&lt;/TT&gt;/&lt;TT&gt;BUP&lt;/TT&gt;/&lt;TT&gt;VOB&lt;/TT&gt;, while titleset ''nn'' (''nn'' &amp;#x220a; 01 .. 99) is kept in the files &lt;TT&gt;VTS_&lt;/TT&gt;''nn''&lt;TT&gt;_&lt;/TT&gt;''m''&lt;TT&gt;.IFO&lt;/TT&gt;/&lt;TT&gt;BUP&lt;/TT&gt;/&lt;TT&gt;VOB&lt;/TT&gt;. The ''m'' part of the name is used to break up long titles to keep each VOB file from becoming too large (it is always 0 for the IFO and BUP files, and for the VOB file containing the menus, if any). If the VMG has no menus or titles, then the file &lt;TT&gt;VIDEO_TS.VOB&lt;/TT&gt; will be absent.

===Example===
Example listing of the contents of the &lt;TT&gt;VIDEO_TS&lt;/TT&gt; directory:
&lt;PRE&gt;
-rw-r--r-- 1 ldo users      30720 Feb 21  2010 VIDEO_TS.BUP
-rw-r--r-- 1 ldo users      30720 Feb 21  2010 VIDEO_TS.IFO
-rw-r--r-- 1 ldo users     366592 Feb 21  2010 VIDEO_TS.VOB
-rw-r--r-- 1 ldo users      18432 Feb 21  2010 VTS_01_0.BUP
-rw-r--r-- 1 ldo users      18432 Feb 21  2010 VTS_01_0.IFO
-rw-r--r-- 1 ldo users     366592 Feb 21  2010 VTS_01_0.VOB
-rw-r--r-- 1 ldo users     366592 Feb 21  2010 VTS_01_1.VOB
-rw-r--r-- 1 ldo users      92160 Feb 21  2010 VTS_02_0.BUP
-rw-r--r-- 1 ldo users      92160 Feb 21  2010 VTS_02_0.IFO
-rw-r--r-- 1 ldo users  477292544 Feb 21  2010 VTS_02_0.VOB
-rw-r--r-- 1 ldo users 1073553408 Feb 21  2010 VTS_02_1.VOB
-rw-r--r-- 1 ldo users   71847936 Feb 21  2010 VTS_02_2.VOB
&lt;/PRE&gt;

Here you can see the VMG and two titlesets (&lt;TT&gt;VTS_01_&lt;/TT&gt;''x''&lt;TT&gt;.&lt;/TT&gt;''xxx'' and &lt;TT&gt;VTS_02_&lt;/TT&gt;''x''&lt;TT&gt;.&lt;/TT&gt;''xxx''). Each titleset has some menu footage (&lt;TT&gt;VTS_&lt;/TT&gt;''nn''&lt;TT&gt;_0.VOB&lt;/TT&gt;), while the title footage in the second titleset is too big for one VOB file, so it is split into two.

== Physical Layout ==

Notwithstanding that a DVD has a full filesystem on it, there are still constraints on how files are located in the physical sectors on the disc. This allows players to be simpleminded and be able to play discs without having to decode fully-arbitrary filesystem structures.

First of all, all files must be contiguous. (This is guaranteed by the ISO9660 filesystem.)

Next, their contents must appear in a specific order, with files belonging to the same domain together: VIDEO_TS.''xxx'' first, then (where present) VTS_01_0.IFO, VTS_01_''n''.VOB, VTS_01_0.BUP, VTS_02_0.IFO, VTS_02_''n''.VOB, VTS_02_0.BUP ... etc with the ''n'' in ascending order. Thus within each domain, the files are ordered thus: first the .IFO, then all the .VOB ones, then the .BUP.

It should be clear from this that the contents of the VIDEO_TS.IFO file will be the physically earliest file data on the disc.

Also, even though there may be multiple VOB files in a titleset, their contents will be physically contiguous and in sequence on the disc. That way, the player can simply determine where the first sector of the first VOB file in a titleset is located, and find the rest of the movie from there, without further reference to the filesystem.

(Ordering information taken from the [http://www.cdrkit.org/ cdrkit] source code, source file &lt;TT&gt;genisoimage/udf.c&lt;/TT&gt;)

== Can a .VOB File Be Played on Its Own? ==

The question is often asked: can the .VOB files be simply copied out of a DVD-Video disc and played on their own? The answer is “mostly yes”.

A .VOB file is an MPEG file with some additional information. The video is in MPEG format, while the audio might be in MPEG-standard or DVD-Video-specific format. Most video players these days should be able to cope with these just fine.

But there is additional information that doesn’t make sense when the .VOB file is taken on its own out of the containing DVD-Video structure: the menus and other interaction features won’t work, and the colour information for the subtitles comes from the IFO file, so these cannot be displayed in the right colours. But they should still be legible if the player assigns some reasonable default colours (or lets the user choose them). Also the identification of which audio track and/or subtitle track to choose for which language comes from the IFO file, so the player will have to let the user try them all to choose a suitable one.

So, in short, if you just want to treat the .VOB file as an MPEG file and ignore the DVD-Video-specific features, it should mostly work.

      <comment>Changed 'is' to 'are' for plural subject</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">MPEG (Motion Picture Experts Group) is the name of a family of format specifications for digital video. DVD-Video is primarily based around MPEG-2, though it also allows MPEG-1 video. This book will not go into all the details of MPEG; it will cover just enough to make sense of how it is used in DVD-Video.

==Streams==
Information in an MPEG file is divided up into ''streams'': the video images form one stream, while the audio soundtrack is kept in another stream. DVD-Video allows for multiple audio streams, which can be used for example for soundtracks in different languages (only one audio stream may be playing at one time). Each stream is identified by a number, of which different ranges are allotted to different stream types. MPEG also allows for two ''private streams'', the format of which is not further defined in MPEG; DVD-Video uses these for various purposes:
* additional audio formats not defined by MPEG (AC-3, DTS, LPCM) (private stream 1)
* subpictures (private stream 1)
* menu buttons, time-display information (''Presentation Control Information'' (PCI), private stream 2)
* navigation information for trick-play and multi-angle modes (''Data Search Information'' (DSI), private stream 2)

==Video Formats==
DVD-Video discs come in two main flavours, corresponding to the main formats used around the world for analog video: NTSC and PAL. NTSC was the first colour TV system, developed in the USA, and used in North America, Japan and a few other places. PAL was a later German development, used in Europe and much of the rest of the world. (There is also a French-developed broadcast format called SECAM, but the format for recorded media is identical to PAL.)

In the NTSC format, each video frame is 720*480 pixels, displayed at a rate of 29.97 frames per second. In the PAL format, each frame is 720*576 pixels, and the display rate is 25fps. Frames may be displayed at an ''aspect ratio'' of 4:3 for narrowscreen footage, or 16:9 for widescreen footage. Note that there is no difference in the numbers of pixels per frame for narrowscreen versus widescreen; the image is simply stretched out for widescreen (this is called ''anamorphic'' widescreen).

The allowed resolutions in DVD-Video are
* for NTSC: 720*480, 704*480, 352*480 or 352*240
* for PAL: 720*576, 704*576, 352*576 or 352*288

==Interlacing==
Unfortunately, DVD-Video has to carry over the ''interlacing'' feature from broadcast TV. That means each video frame is split into two ''fields'', one consisting of the odd-numbered scan lines, the other containing the even-numbered ones, which are displayed one after the other.

==Packets and Headers==
The contents of each stream are divided into ''packets'', which are ''multiplexed''—a packet for one stream is followed by that for another stream which is to be presented at close to the same time—to allow a player to read and decode the file sequentially. You will come across the term ''Packetized Elementary Stream'' (PES) for this representation. In particular, each packet begins with a ''header'' containing an identifying code indicating the type of packet, followed by a two-byte field indicating the length of the packet contents.

There are also additional “headers”, with different identifying codes, used to specify various additional information:
* a ''system header'' gives information about the number of streams in the movie file. There needs to be at least one of these, at the start of the file.
* a ''PACK header'' gives information about the data rate needed to decode the movie file, as well as giving a high-precision clock reference (in units of a 27MHz clock). The presence of one of these indicates the start of a “PACK”, which basically consists of the header plus all following PES packets until the next PACK header. DVD-Video requires that each pack be 2048 bytes in size.

==GOP, I-Frame, B-Frame, P-Frame==
Most video codecs rely heavily on interframe as well as intraframe compression to reduce data sizes. An ''I-Frame'' is a frame of video compressed by itself, without looking at other frames. The encoding scheme used is similar to JPEG compression. However, subsequent frames are quite likely to look similar (think of the common case of something or someone moving against a still background); therefore, instead of compressing them on their own as additional I-Frames, it makes sense to encode them as ''P-Frames'' which are differences from the preceding ''reference'' frame (which can be an I-Frame or a P-Frame) or as ''B-Frames'' which are differences from both preceding and following I- or P-frames.

The drawback with this is, if you try to start playback from some arbitrary point that is not at the beginning of the file, the player has to seek backwards until it hits an I-frame before it can start sensibly decoding the video. Thus, using fewer I-frames improves compression, at the expense of quick random access into the video stream. The DVD-Video specification requires at least one I-frame every 36 fields for NTSC or every 30 fields for PAL (i.e. at least every 0.6 seconds).

The sequence of frames starting from an I-frame until the last frame before the next I-frame (in other words, containing all the frames depending in some way on the starting I-frame) is called a ''Group of Pictures'' (GOP).

==VOBU, Cell, Program, PGC==
As previously mentioned, DVD-Video expects to see a PACK header every 2048 bytes. The contents of the first pack must be a PCI and a DSI packet; this is called a “NAV PACK”. Following this will be other PACKs containing video, audio or subpicture stream packets as appropriate, in no particular order, but the NAV information must be first, and the video packets should contain one or more complete GOPs. The NAV and following packs (up to the next NAV PACK) make up a ''Video Object Unit'' (VOBU), and is the smallest unit that the decoder can work with. The duration of a VOBU must be from 0.4 to 1.0 seconds.

DVD-Video defines additional levels of grouping beyond this; one or more VOBUs make up a ''cell''; one or more cells make up a ''program'', and one or more programs make up a ''program chain'' (PGC). Particular programs can each be identified in the file structure as a ''Part of Title'' (PTT), otherwise known to ordinary people as a ''chapter''. An actual title on the disc can correspond to a single PGC, or sometimes to multiple PGCs.

Additional significance of the groupings is as follows:
* a cell is the smallest unit that can be targeted by a jump.
* a cell can have a single VM instruction attached to be executed when the cell finishes playing.
* skipping with the Next/Prev buttons on the player remote is done in units of programs, not necessarily chapters.
* only PTTs (chapters) can be the target of a jump from outside the containing PGC; jumps to cells and (non-chapter) programs can only happen from within the containing PGC.
* a PGC can have a sequence of VM commands to be executed prior to playing, and another to be executed at the end. The PGC also defines the 16-entry colour table from which subpictures within the PGC can choose 4 at a time to display.

There is a special “first-play” PGC (FPC) in the VMG which is automatically entered when the disc is put into the player; this has no MPEG data, but it is the commands here that are responsible for jumping to the initial menu (if any), playing all the preamble sequences etc.

==Menus vs Titles==
''Menus'' and ''titles'' are very similar; both are PGCs, and both can have interactive buttons. However, only titles can have chapters, and only titles can be split across multiple VOB files (which imposes a maximum length on the duration of a menu). Also, only titles can have multiple audio and subpicture tracks for different languages, because a menu is already part of a language-specific menu group.

==Special Menus==
Certain menus can be marked as ''entries'' that can be directly invoked via dedicated buttons on the player remote.

In the VMG, one menu can be marked as the ''title'' entry, which means it can be brought up by the “Top Menu” button on the remote.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Parashah Nasso (take, elevate)   Numbers 4:21-7:89

In this connection, we learn of the census and responsibilities of the rest of the tribe of Levi (4:21-49). This is followed by five topics that are all connected, in one way or another, with the Mishkan and the divisions of the tribes:
1. Sending out the unclean from the camp (5:1-4).
2. Laws of theft, which can involve sacrifices and the transfer of property to the Kohanim (5:5-10).
3. The Sotah (wayward wife, suspected of adultery) (5:11-31).
4. The Nazir (6:1-21).
5. The blessings of the Kohanim (6:22-27).


&lt;u&gt;The Unclean&lt;/u&gt;

Anyone who was unclean according to the Torah was to be sent outside of the camp because them remaining in it would  defile the camp as He dwelt in the midst of it.   Later we know that Yahweh removed His presence from the midst of the camp and would only meet with Moses at the Tent of Meeting which was set up outside the camp.  While the Tabernacle remained in the center of the camp Yahweh Himself no longer came into the midst of the camp because of the sin of Israel.

This takes on importance when we connect the stories of what the Rabbis said happened after the death and resurrection of Yeshua back in the first century - how the Shechinah or Presence of God or His Glory departed from the Temple after this time and did not come into the Holy of Holies anymore on the Day of Atonement.  The tradition tells us that when the High Priest would go into the Holy of Holies after this time, the cloud no longer appeared which meant the Glory of God no longer came into the Temple.  Also in the past, if the sins of Israel were forgiven the red cloth which was tied to the Azazel goat turned white.   It was related that after this time the red cloth no longer turned white.   God had removed Himself from the midst of the people  because of their sin.   His Presence will also withdraw from our lives if we indulge in sin.

The passage also goes on to address any unfaithfulness against Yahweh which needs to be confessed and the appropriate restitution made.   It is a mitzvah of the Torah to confess our sins and repent from them. When we sin, we are not to remain in the sin, nor are we to passively accept the fact that we are sinners.  We must humble ourselves to confess the sin and then turn away from it.  It is a positive commandment, to confess one’s sins and repent from them.  Even the smallest sin should be confessed. Confession should be made privately, but audibly, directly to Yahweh.  King David says, “I acknowledged my sin to You, and my iniquity I did not hide; I said, ‘I will confess my transgressions to Yahweh; and You forgave the guilt of my sin.&quot;    Psalm 32:5 John the beloved disciple says, “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”  1 John 1:9


&lt;u&gt;The Wayward Woman&lt;/u&gt;

The Sotah is a woman who has strayed from the norms of community behavior and has not acted with discretion in that she has been in circumstances that arouse suspicion and there are no witnesses that can prove guilt or innocence.   If she protests her innocence against the suspicion of her husband, then, as long as both she and her husband consent, her innocence or guilt is tested with the ceremony of the “bitter waters”.  The local court listens to the accusations, and then sends two judges to chaperone the husband and wife on their way to the Sanhedrin. All along the way, and again in court, the wife is told that if she will admit her sin, she will be divorced and that she need not go through the ordeal. If she continues to argue her innocence, then the Priest/Kohen administers the oath as in Ch.5:19-21.  The whole passage then is written on parchment. The Kohen removes her headcovering and pours water from the basin into an earthenware vessel, adds dust from the floor of the Temple and then dissolves the ink writing of the parchment which has Yahweh's Name written thereon, into the mixture. The woman is then made to drink the mixture, which proves her innocence, if she is unharmed, or guilt, if the curse comes true.   If she is innocent the blessing follows in her bearing offspring, but if guilty she would fall down dead.  If she confessed, she would be divorced and not receive the death penalty because there were no witnesses which was necessary by law to execute the death penalty for adultery. Some Rabbis say that this was seldom carried out to the full, as if the woman was guilty she would confess beforehand.

The purpose was to protect the wife's innocence against unreasonable suspicions or else to prove her guilty by ordeal.  The ceremony of the Sotah removes the cause for suspicion and protects her from the extremes of jealousy, which in many societies often leads to violence and in some cases, murder.  Thus it provided a way for the husband to deal with his jealousy.  Were it not for the commandment of the Sotah, the impulse for jealousy would go unchecked.  Yahweh compensates the innocent woman for her humiliation with blessing.  
The Targum Johnathan says “her brightness will shine forth, and she will find affection before her husband, and become the mother of a son.” 

When Yahweh joins husband and wife, they share the same “basar”, that is “flesh”.  Yahweh preserves the holy union of two individuals made one.  The ordinary term for marriage is “kiddushin” and denotes sanctification.  It is so called because the husband sanctifies (i.e.sets apart) his wife from the whole world like an object which is dedicated to the Sanctuary. It implies the strictest chastity in both parties  

In John  8:3-11, the Torah teachers and the Pharisees of the day brought in a woman caught in the &quot;act of adultery&quot; yet no witnesses came forward and the man by law should also have been brought.  The purpose was to trap Him and bring charges against Him.   It seems that her sin was a foregone conclusion as far as Yeshua was concerned, but her accusers were not following the law in not bringing the man involved, and none of them when challenged were without sin themselves.

Here Yeshua the Living Word, protected this woman against the injustices of those involved, telling her to go and sin no more.
Sometimes in life, the actual sin of adultery may not have been committed. Yeshua spoke of committing adultery in your hearts by looking upon another lustfully.  This is often an instance of coveting what is your neighbour's also. (5:11-31  -  Matthew 5:28 )

We all sin in some way and cause offence against our Heavenly Father and fellow man.  When we are convicted of our sin or it is brought to our attention by someone else, how quick are we to repent, seek forgiveness and make restitution, when necessary?  Husbands, do you repent to your wives. Wives do you repent to your husbands? James 5:16 says to, &quot;Confess your faults to one another...&quot; then indicates that because we fail to do so our physical healing may be impeded.


&lt;u&gt;The Nazarite Vow&lt;/u&gt;  Ch. 5:1-21 

The word Nazirite comes from the Hebrew word nazir, rhzb, and means “dedicated” or “consecrated.” Accordingly, it seems to be a vow one may voluntarily take in order to temporarily dedicate himself either to do a special task for the Lord or to consecrate his life in a special manner for spiritual things. In order to accomplish this dedication, the Nazirite was required to observe three things:
# total abstinence from grapes or all grape products,
# refrain from cutting his hair during the time of the vow,
# avoid coming near to a corpse.

Any breach of these stipulations nullified the period of consecration and a new beginning had to take place.   Ordinarily, it is a vow entered into voluntarily.
The hair is a symbol of the vital power at its full natural development; and the free growth of the hair on the head represented the dedication of the man with all his strength and powers to the service of God.   There have been several recorded occasions in Biblical times that women undertook a Nazarite vow.  See Numbers 30: 3 - 16

It is Yahweh's purpose at this time, to set His people apart from the world and its affairs, calling us out and purifying us for His purposes.  What is of significance is that the one who took the vow, brought his offering after the period of consecration and not during it.   At the conclusion of the period of nezirut, the Nazir brought a series of offerings--a male lamb as an &quot;ascending offering,&quot; an ewe lamb as a &quot;sin offering,&quot; and a ram as a &quot;peace offering&quot;. The Nazir's hair, which had grown freely throughout the nezirut, is now completely shorn and burned in the fire beneath the peace offering.

The fact that the instructions for those taking a Nazarite vow immediately follow those regarding an adulterous woman underscores the fact that to lead a chaste life one must not do anything that would stimulate the evil inclination (carnal nature) and incite it to sin (such as adultery). The evil imaginations of the heart are easily aroused and the consumption of wine can lead to sin. A Nazarite avoided wine for this reason in order to facilitate the leading of a chaste, kadosh (set apart) life. What carnal indulgences do we permit in our lives which war against our spirit man and weaken us morally so that we are more susceptible to fall into temptation and sin?  In 1 Corinthians 15:33 we read, &quot;Evil company corrupts good habits.&quot; 

Though not under a Nazarite vow, we must nonetheless lead chaste, set apart/kadosh and pure lives abstaining from that which contaminates, corrupts and brings spiritual death. Abstain from all appearances of evil (1 Thes. 5:22) and the fleshly lusts that war against our souls (1 Peter 2:11). 


&lt;u&gt;The Aaronic or Priestly Blessings of 6:22-27&lt;/u&gt;

And God spoke to Moses, saying:  Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying: Thus shall you bless the children of Israel; say to them:   “Yahweh bless you and keep you. Yahweh make His face shine upon you, and give you grace. Yahweh lift up His face to you and give you peace.&quot;

The blessing, according to ancient Rabbinic tradition, was to be pronounced only by the Kohain Gadol, the High Priest, who are the descendants of Aaron.   In the preparatory prayer, prayed by the priest before pronouncing the blessing, he blesses Yahweh and commits himself to this office with the holiness of Aaron, and to fulfill this act in love. 


The Aaronic Blessing can be subdivided into three sections:

(a) The First Blessing: May Yahweh bless you and safe guard you.   He is the God who Keeps us.   The rabbis take this to refer to the material and physical blessings that Torah obedience brings as enumerated in Deuteronomy 28:1-14. This includes good health, wealth, divine protection and victory over enemies. Yahweh's blessing and his safeguarding of those blessings from those who would kill, steal and destroy them go hand-in-hand. The rabbis teach that &quot;the best way for someone to preserve his wealth is to use it for charity and good deeds. That assures him of God's continued blessing&quot; (ibid. p. 763).

(b) The Second Blessing: May Yahweh illuminate His countenance for you and be gracious to you. He is the God of all grace.
The rabbis teach that this illumination refers to the light of the Torah and they cite Proverbs 6:23, &quot;For the commandment is a lamp and the Torah is a light.&quot; Compare this with what John said about Yeshua in John 1:1-14; 8:12; 9:5. Yahweh's grace involves his granting his people Torah knowledge, wisdom and understanding to utilize Torah properly and fully; to use the insights gained therefrom to comprehend his purposes (ibid. p. 763).

(c) The Third Blessing: May Yahweh lift his countenance and establish peace/shalom for you.   He is the God Who grants peace.
In Hebraic thought the idea of Yahweh's face or countenance shining toward his people is a metaphor of divine grace and favor. Contrariwise, when his face is turned against His people, this represents divine disapproval and shame upon his people. The rabbis note that peace is an essential component of the other blessings, for what good is physical blessings and spiritual insight if one's life is devoid of peace? What is the Jewish concept of peace? Balance. The absence of strife between the opposing forces in one's life. Sin disrupts this balance and causes strife and warfare as well as creating a barrier between Yahweh and his people (read what Rabbi Yeshua taught about this in Matthew 5:23-24). When such strife and barriers exist causing the negation of peace what are some things one must do to restore the peace. After all, Yeshua said, &quot;Blessed [Happy] are the peacemakers...&quot; Does peace just happen or is it necessary to exert effort to create it? Can there be peace where there is sin (Torahlessness)? Does it logically follow that the more our ways line up with the Torah of Yahweh, the more our ways are pleasing to him, the more peace we will experience in all our relationships?  Read Proverbs 16:7.

(d) The Bearers of His Name:  By invoking the blessing of Yahweh upon the people the priest was to &quot;put My name upon the children of Israel&quot;   Bearing His Name is synonymous with bearing His Presence which had been imparted by the blessing. 

The Targum Johnathan brings out the traditional understanding of this blessing, &quot;The Lord bless thee in all thy business, and keep thee from demons of the night, and things that cause terror, and from demons of the noon and of the morning, and from malignant spirits arid phantoms. The Lord make His face to shine upon thee, when occupied in the law (Torah), and reveal to thee its secrets, and be merciful unto thee. The Lord lift up His countenance upon thee in thy prayer, and grant thee peace in thy end. And they shall bestow the benediction of My Name upon the children of Israel, and I, by My Word, will bless them.&quot;


&lt;u&gt;A Meditation&lt;/u&gt;

“May Yahweh bless you and keep you.&quot;
Before you found the Messiah, God sought for you!  He sought to bless you, by bringing you into the fellowship of His beloved Son!  When the time was right, and your heart was tender, He lovingly reached out to you and saved you from the death-grip that sin had you in!  Once your tender heart accepted His covenant relationship, based on trusting faithfulness to His Only, Unique Son, His covenant love for you secured a place for you in His Kingdom to come!  You were His for the keeping!

“May Yahweh make his face shine on you and show you his favor.&quot;
The Torah teaches us the wonderful, yet mysterious truth that the “saving” Name of Yahweh is Yeshua!  The Mighty Name of Yeshua is the power of Salvation from the Father himself!  When His Salvation walked the earth in bodily form, we beheld His kâvod (glory), and it was full of Grace and Truth!  To attempt to look at the Eternal Yahweh was to invite instantaneous death!  To be sure, the Torah teaches us that no man has seen God and lived!  Yet, Yeshua informed us that to look upon His face is to behold the face of the Father!  The gracious expression of the Father favor was demonstrated most fully in his Son’s bloody sacrificial death, burial and miraculous resurrection!  Through the Father’s sacrifice of His Son, the Father’s face shines down upon us!  The idiom ‘to cause one’s face to shine upon’ another, means to be friendly toward another.  When God’s face is directed  this way, it means the removal of the enmity that sin causes and the outpouring of divine love and salvation. (Hertz op. cit. p.595)

“May Yahweh lift up his face toward you and give you peace&quot;
Yahweh lifting up His face toward us is an action that indicates His attention directed toward us to impart His peace.  The Hebrew word ‘to lift’, also carries the meaning of ‘to raise up, furnish, magnify, pardon’.  from the root of this Hebrew word comes the meaning of ‘rising wind’, ‘vapor’.  The magnificent Rising Wind which uplifts the Face of Yahweh and furnishes us with all the benefits of Yeshua’s salvation is the Ruach HaKodesh.  He is the lifter of our souls and His miracle-working indwelling power is the source of ushering in the genuine shalom that only comes from knowing the Messiah Yeshua in the pardon of our sins!

The Name of Yahweh is a strong tower, the righteous run into it, and they are saved.  Without the peace that passes understanding, nothing else matters.  And that peace is only available through the Prince of Peace.  So, how are we to bless our neighbors?  First, we must be cleansed of our own sin. Then, we must enter into the Presence of God, only with blood, and speak the Name above all names.  Then, sanctified by His Presence, by the holiness that is ours only in the Messiah, we must experience love for our neighbors.   The Rabbis teach that if the Priest has anything against one member of the congregation, he must be absent from this time of blessing.  We then, with purpose and respect for God and the office of priesthood  in which He has placed us, speak to God about the physical needs, the emotional needs, and the spiritual needs of our ‘neighbors’.   It is an awesome responsibility to bear the Name of Yahweh, to have His Name put upon us by our Great High Priest, Yeshua.

As we are a Royal Priesthood, we now occupy the position of those called to bless in His Name and we must follow His pattern.   The Rabbinical tradition is that before raising their hands to bless others, they pray: &quot;Blessed are You, O Yahweh our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with the holiness of Aaron and has commanded us to bless His people with love.”    

The power of blessing, the power of our words. The Bible teaches that words can heal, build up and encourage, or kill, tear down and curse, that the power of life and death is in the tongue. What kind of words come from your mouth _ especially to your spouse and children?  How often do we speak blessings over our children and spouses?   We should bless those who curse us also and not just those who are our friends.   How about those who cut you off in traffic and similar situations?  Yahweh sees!


&lt;u&gt;Dedication of the Sanctuary&lt;/u&gt;

The Torah now resumes its account (which it left off in the 10th chapter of Leviticus, back in the Parshah of Shemini) of the dedication of the Sanctuary on the 1st of Nissan, one year (less two weeks) after the Exodus.
And it came to pass on the day that Moses had finished setting up the Tabernacle, and had anointed and sanctified it, and all its vessels, and the altar and all its vessels...
The nessi’im of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, who were the princes of the tribes... approached; and they brought their offerings before God on behalf of each tribe.

The Torah then proceeds to itemize each tribe’s gift separately, although each nassi brought the very same 35 items as his offering.  After listing the twelve tribes’ offerings on the first twelve days of Nissan, the Torah summarizes:
This was the dedication of the altar, in the day when it was anointed, by the princes of Israel: twelve dishes of silver, twelve silver bowls, twelve spoons of gold... All the silver vessels weighed two thousand four hundred shekels... all the gold of the spoons was a hundred and twenty shekels.   All the oxen for the burnt offerings were twelve bullocks, the rams twelve, the yearling lambs twelve, with their meal offering. The kids of the goats for sin offerings twelve. And all the oxen for the sacrifice of the peace offerings were twenty four bullocks, the rams sixty, the he goats sixty, the yearling lambs sixty.

“And when Moses would go into the Tent of Meeting to speak with Him, then he heard the voice speaking to him from off the covering that was upon the Ark of Testimony, from between the two cherubim; and it spoke to him.&quot;
The Torah recounts each tribe’s gift separately, repeating the 35-item list twelve times in succession.

Even thought each one’s gift was the same, it was given the same recognition and the same importance. So it was with each tribe, they all had their function and purpose in the divine plan, much like the Body of Christ has  varying functions within it’s ministry.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Beha’alotecha – In Your Making Go Up  Numbers 8:1-12-16

As we look at this week’s Torah portion we are directed to the continuing saga of the children of Israel and some of the trials and tribulations of the sojourn through the wilderness wanderings.  Parshas B’Haloscha can be divided into two distinct parts. The first part discusses the daily lighting of the Menorah, the consecration of the Leviyim into the service of the Mishkan, and the laws of Pesach Shaynie (the second chance for bringing the Pascal Lamb). The second part returns to the organization, travels, and challenges of the Jews as they prepared to enter Eretz Yisroel. Rashi explains that the word “beha’alotecha” (literally “when you step up”) is used because there was a ma’aleh - step -   in front of the menorah on which the Kohen stood as he prepared the wicks and oil of the menorah.


&lt;u&gt;The Menorah&lt;/u&gt;

Yahweh spoke to Moshe, saying, “Speak to Aaron and say to him: When you kindle the lamps, toward the face of the Menorah shall the seven lamps cast light.” Aaron did so; toward the face of the Menorah he kindled its lamps, as Yahweh had commanded Moshe. This is the workmanship of the Menorah, hammered-out gold, from its base to its flower it is hammered out; according to the vision that Yahweh showed Moshe, so did he make the Menorah.

Yahweh’s instruction to Aaron to “raise light” in the lamps of the menorah in the Sanctuary, so that “the seven lamps should give light toward the face of the menorah.”     Bamidbar/Numbers 8:1-4

Moshe is given the design for the menorah that is to be placed in the Tent of Meeting.  This seven-branched candelabra is to be formed from a single ingot of gold and is to illuminate the Holy of Holies where the Ark of the Covenant is located. The menorah, however, was hammered out of a single piece of gold, originating as a single object and remaining a single object through the various stages of its construction to the finished product.

The instructions for the lighting of the Menorah are given here because the altar has just been dedicated in Numbers 7. With the dedication of the altar, the tabernacle worship has begun. The menorah will have to be lit the following morning and then every day thereafter.   The command and key word is to give light in “front” of the Menorah or ‘toward the face of the Menorah’. The rabbis teach that the three wicks on the right and the three on the left were all directed toward the Menorah’s central stem, thus concentrating light toward the center. The Menorah symbolized that Yahweh is the Source of all light (Artscroll Stone Edition Chumash, p. 775).   Thus the command is meant to specify that the six lights beside the central one should be arranged to shine the light in front of the Menorah, or in the direction of the table of the Bread of the Presence.

The menorah had seven branches, nine flowers, eleven knobs, and twenty-two cups, and according to the Gemara (Menachot 28b) it was eighteen tefachim (handbreadths) tall or three amot, approximately five feet.  It was one solid piece of beaten work of gold (Vs.4). . . and the flowers of beaten work—The Menorah was an amazing piece of art, beaten from a single piece of gold and not molded. The shape included almond blossoms as the cups holding the oil for each of the 7 lights.

It symbolizes an eternal light as well as the eternal vigilance of Yahweh towards His people.  Each of the three lamps on the left and the three lamps on the right were all directed towards the central stem of the lamp. If we pattern our lives in this manner of keeping our eyes on Yeshua, we will walk in His light of which He is a conduit from the Father ( we see God in the face of Yeshua 2 Cor.4:6; Heb.12: 2).  The central branch which is the Menorah, pointed straight up, toward Yahweh.  In Isaiah 11: 2, we have a picture of the central branch of the ‘Spirit of Yahweh’ from which the spirit of wisdom, understanding, counsel, might, knowledge and fear of Yahweh are manifested.   It is as if to say that the other six lights of the Menorah which also correspond to the six days of creation and the six millennia of history, are all just to “launch” us into the realm of God.  All manifestations of His presence, His power and His purposes are directed toward finding fulfillment in Him as the central focal point of our lives.

The central trunk is the true Menorah from which the six branches shoot.   The highest central lamp is called the “Shamasch”, that is, the “Servant”.  The Menorah represents our relationship to Yeshua the servant of Yahweh, of which we are the branches.

Yeshua said, “I am the vine and you are the branches?” (John 15:5)  He is the main branch that carries the life to the attached human branches of the Menorah.  Does the power of His resurrected life and anointing flow through you even as oil was in the Menorah and as sap flows through a tree to its branches?  Is Yeshua the center of all that we do and say and can we say as the Apostle Paul did, that “in him we live and move and have our being”  Acts 17:28
The Menorahs of the seven Messianic assemblies of Revelation 2 and 3 represent the same truth of their testimony of light as an assembly, shining from the oil/anointing of the Spirit flowing through them.  (Rev. 1:3, 20)

“In Him was life; and the life was the light of men,”  (John 1: 4).   Through His life we become a light.  We are to be a reflection of His glory, and though not the source of the light, we reflect His light to show the unsearchable riches and the glorious mystery which from the beginning of the world has been hidden away in Yeshua - that is Messiah in us - His Word embodied in us.  
The Menorah was a light to the world, and thus also represent God’s Torah.  Note that even a person who was not a priest could light the lamps of the Menorah,  to spread the light of His Presence which is seen through His Word enacted in our lives. 	  (Compare to Matthew 5:13-16)

The word ‘beha’alosecha’  is not the normal one used for “lighting” which is “Lhadlik.” The Torah used the word “B’Haloscha” which literally means to “lift or raise up,” rather than the literally correct word, B’Hadlikcha “when you light.”  For this reason the Rabbis say that Aharon is being instructed - “when you ignite the Menorah, make sure that it is a flame that can stand on its own, one that reaches Heavenward by itself. You may have to initiate the flame, but, after that, the flame must be able to rise independent of any further effort on your part.”   The Talmud states, “This teaches that the job of the Kohain Gadol when lighting the Menorah was to make sure that once lit each flame would stay lit and “rise up by itself.”  This speaks of raising up the other individual lights that can stand independently strong and brightly burning the ‘oil’.

The essence of good spiritual instruction is facilitating the person’s own desire to feel the presence of God, something that must be inspired, because it must be pursued with one’s life-force.  The ideal form of inspiration is the kind that we feel when we catch a glimpse of Yahweh’s master plan, and how we can contribute to its completion.   This was part of Aharon’s job to transmit this message to the rest of the nation, so that each and everyone could hook into that master plan, and feel a sense of destiny being attached to it. This would then result in a great desire to be a partner in that plan, bringing the person closer to Yahweh in the process, and closer to their own personal capacity of greatness and fulfillment.

Thus the Menorah symbolized each one’s unique ability to understand and serve God.  The High Priest was to inspire and teach others through both word and deed to accept their divinity and act accordingly.  The test of his success would be when each candle would “rise by itself”,  set alight by the illumination of His Spirit to serve Yahweh in his individual capacity.  Ultimately, it would be Aharon who would inspire and nurture that individual responsibility for divinity, until each one could rise up by itself.”   Yeshua now takes this responsibility to ignite our flame to burn and stand by itself.

“The soul of man is a candle of Yahweh” (Proverbs 20:27).  Every believer must also exercise his priesthood and see to it that his candle shines brightly and ensure that his brother’s candle also is lit.   The soul of your fellow is a ready lamp, filled with the purest oil and equipped with all that is required to convert its fuel into a blazing flame.  It only lacks the proximity of another lamp to ignite it.  If your own soul is alight, its contact with another’s soul will awaken its potential for light, so that it may illuminate its surroundings and kindle other souls, in turn.  Are we “raised up” in being a light in our service to Yahweh?    Yeshua instructed us to let our lights shine so that others will be enlightened by the flavour of the spiritual ‘food’ which we have to offer (i.ew. - the salt of our lives). (Matthew 5:13-16)

The priests stood before the menorah and we stand before the Menorah which is the golden light of the presence of Yahweh that comes through Yeshua from Yahweh.


&lt;u&gt;Purification and dedication of the Levites&lt;/u&gt;

Moshe then gathers all the people in front of the Sanctuary, where the tribe of Levi is initiated into the Temple service as assistants to the Kohanim (priests).   They then immerse in a pool of water, shave off all their hair, are sprinkled with the ashes of the Red Heifer, and bring offerings to God.   The shaving of the hair symbolises the removal of all of man’s glory, all of his natural pride and dignity, i.e. becoming completely stripped bare before the Almighty.  To bear His glory, ours must go.  

The people lay their hands upon the Levites, and Aaron the High Priest lifts  each of them up as an “uplifting before God”  For,  The Levites are given as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the Tent of Meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel...   “And after that, the Levites went in to do their service in the Tent of Meeting before Aaron and before his sons; as God had commanded Moshe...&quot;

The consecration of the Levites at this juncture fits perfectly. The Kohain Gadol’s job of inspiring and nurturing the nation needed help. The Levites were that help.  In this case the Levites were gifts to their superiors, the priests. The prince of the tribe of Levi was the Kohain Gadol (the High Priest); therefore, after Aharon had been given his symbolic job of preparing and lighting the Menorah the Levites were consecrated into their duty. Until now their function was to care and carry the Mishkan; however, upon crossing the Jordan their real job would begin. The Levites were to be the conscience of the nation.  Living among the people, teaching them, inspiring them, and representing the duality of free willed service to both God and man.

Specific instructions are given for the Levites who have been deemed the equivalent of the first born sons and dedicated to service unto the Almighty.  As we are all priests through the work of Messiah on the cross and our faith in the redemptive result of His sacrifice, we need to take hold of the fact that the Levites have no inheritance in the Land. They were set aside to serve Yahweh and the people of Israel.  This is the position which we have to assume of having no worldly inheritance, but that we are called to serve in His tabernacle with all our earthly needs provided for that purpose. 


&lt;u&gt;The Second Passover&lt;/u&gt;

Numbers 9:6-11 tells of a “second Passover” being added for those who were defiled by a dead body and could not keep the usual Feast because of unchangeable circumstances, and an ordinance was made for them of one month later “at the appointed time”.
In its appointed time [season]/moed. The word moed (Strong’s H#4150; TWOT 878b) primarily means an appointment, a fixed time or season, a festival, an assembly, the congregation, the place of meeting (- i.e. a meeting with Yahweh.)

This is a gracious allowance for the circumstances of life so that His people can keep this special appointment to meet with Him. There are exceptions for those who would want to keep Pesach but for what ever reason are unable to.  These exemptions were being ritually unclean and being caught travelling.  We know that failure to keep Pesach is to be cut off from your people or your heritage and consequently your loss of identity. Yeshua Himself faithfully kept Pesach, should we not emulate Him and do the same?   

In Numbers 9:14, God states that those Gentiles who associate themselves with Israel were to follow the same Torah ordinances as Israel did: “…you shall have one ordinance, for the stranger, and for him who was born in the land.”  Compare this to Ephesians 2:11-13, where Paul tells Gentiles who come to Yeshua that they were no longer to be strangers to the Torah ordinances of Israel as they were now one with them.  (Compare Yeshua’s comments at the beginning of His midrash on Torah observance in Matthew 5:17-21 to his concluding ones in Matthew 7:21-23.)

The word given to them the was that if they failed to keep Passover, they would be ‘cut off’ from among the people.  This was done literally then, but now it has a spiritual application and failure to keep the feasts causes us to be cut off in a spiritual measure from His life.

The term ‘cut off’ (expelled or killed - 9:13) is used in the Torah about 34 times and is usually referring to Israelites being cut off (expelled) from the camp of Israel for rebellion and disobedience against Yahweh’s commands.  This is a spiritual principle that applies to us today with regard to the assembly of believers.  Leaders are instructed to expel someone for disobedience and rebellion against Yahweh’s commandments? (See Rom. 16:17; Tit. 3:10; 2 Thes. 3:6; 2 Tim. 3:5; 1 Cor. 5:5; 11:27-30).


&lt;u&gt;The Silver Trumpets&lt;/u&gt;

It was at this point that the instructions for the two silver trumpets are given (and not the rams horn - the shofar)   “to summon the community, and to make journey the camps.&quot; which are to call the people to meeting, to war or to sound the alarm.   It was shaped similar to modern trumpets according to the description of Josephus and the sounds used were also similar to those still in use with the shofar. 

The long blast on the trumpet is called the tekiah, the short blast is called the teruah which is usually sounded as nine short staccato sounds.

The straight long blast (tekiah) is to be used to summon the people: if both trumpets are sounded, the entire people should gather before the entrance of the Sanctuary; one trumpet means that only the tribal heads were being summoned.

When the people break camp, the start of the journey is to be heralded with a series of short blasts (teruah). The first teruah signals the tribes camping to the east to begin moving; the next series of short blasts sets the southern camp in motion, and so on, according to the order instructed earlier (Numbers 2).   Trumpets are also to be sounded when going out to war, and when bringing the seasonal offerings in the Holy Temple.   The procedure for using trumpets to summons or signal the nation of Israel was an eternal decree (v. 8) (Stone Edition Chumash, p. 783).

The silver trumpets were taken by the Romans in AD 70 and have not been in use since.

The rabbis teach that the sounding of these silver trumpets is directly linked to Yom Teruah (Feast of Trumpets) which is symbolic of the return of Yeshua and the regathering of His people Israel. These two silver trumpets prophetically represent the two Houses of Israel being called to gather before His sanctuary (a call to holiness) for the final spiritual warfare of this age against the saints receiving their promised inheritance.


&lt;u&gt;The readiness of the Israelites to travel&lt;/u&gt;

After being encamped at Horeb at the foot of Mt. Sinai for more than a year (10:11-12), the Children of Israel begin their journey to the land of Canaan.  During the past year they were transformed from a rabble of former slaves into a fledgling nation: they heard Yahweh teach the Torah, they built the Mishkan and they organized their camp.  Now they are ready to establish the nation of Israel in the land promised to their forefathers.

Newlyweds (in this case, Yahweh and Israel) were to spend one year together (getting to know each other) before going to war (Deut. 24:5).  It was now time for Israel to go forward in their journey of taking the promised land from the enemy.  The wilderness journey is symbolic of the tribulation period - the silver trumpets of Yahweh will signal His prophetic people when to move forward and when to camp in formation on their journey to the Israel of the kingdom. There is a war to be waged in our spiritual journey to overcome the flesh and take hold of our inheritance.  There is a spiritual parallel to the conflicts which they went through in the wilderness before they reached the promised land to us overcoming in our individual lives.   

When the Mishkan was assembled, the cloud covered it.  In the evening until the morning, it appeared as if fire was over the Mishkan. The cloud covered it [by day], and there was the appearance of fire by night.  When the cloud rose from above the Mishkan, then the Children of Israel marched on; where the cloud stopped, the Children of Israel camped.  Thus at the command of Yahweh the Children of Israel traveled, and at the command of Yahweh they camped ... (9:15-18)   This text teaches us that Yahweh led his people with a command that was manifested by the cloud and by the prophet. Yahweh gave the command by moving the cloud and by Moshe who gave the order. This teaches us that we ought to follow Yahweh’s word that is given through His Spirit and through his prophets so that we do not fall behind and miss the move of Yahweh in this time. One who believes that he can serve Yahweh in the same way that people served Him in the past is mistaken. Since Yahweh is always moving, we must be willing to leave one place and go on with Him, instead of staying within established human structures, even though they may have been very useful during times past.

“Then it came about when the ark set out that Moshe said, ‘Rise up, O Yahweh! And let Your enemies be scattered, and let those who hate You flee before You. ' When it came to rest, he said, ‘Return, O Yahweh, to the myriad thousands of Israel”   Numbers 10:35-36

This was in essence a war cry.  It was the General shouting on behalf of the Commander-in-Chief to his enemies “here we come. you had better flee’.   When the ‘battle’ was finished the general was telling the Commander-in-Chief that because of his brilliantly orchestrated victory, His Presence could now rest in the camp.  

There was great joy in the camp when the glory cloud lifted, the priests hoisted the ark to their shoulders and it was time for the camp to go forth as led by Yahweh with His servants carrying the ark.
When they move forward it was in formation, with Judah in the lead, then Issachar and Zebulon (Praise and victory initiate the move supported by intercession [Issachar] and evangelism/taking the spoil [Zebulon]  with the other tribes behind in their order.   


&lt;u&gt;The Flesh Complains&lt;/u&gt;

The portion then turns to the almost incessant complaints of the sons of Israel and how the Holy One dealt with their insurrection and demands for food and the culinary comforts of Egypt.  In Egypt it rained very little and the country would rely on the Nile river for irrigation. When the water would rise and flow into the fields, it would contain fish, and when the water would subside, the fish remained on the ground. Thus the slaves who worked the fields for their masters would take home fish together with vegetables from the fields.   In spite of their slavery, food was plentiful.

The people complain, incurring the wrath of God, and a fire rages at &quot;the edge of the camp.&quot; The Aramaic targums cite that there &quot;were wicked men of the people, who, being discontent, devised and imagined evil before Yahweh&quot; and that there was idolatry in the camp of Dan that was related to this insurrection. (Targum Johnathan)   

The people again call out to Moshe, who prays for the fire to be quenched.   But soon they are complaining again.    &quot;And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting; and the children of Israel also wept again, and said: &quot;Who shall give us meat to eat?&quot;   &quot;We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt for nothing; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic. But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes...&quot;

This was the beginning of a long list of such incidents in Israel's wilderness journey.  Do we complain and murmur about something that bothers us going on within the assembly of Believers or otherwise when our needs are not met?
Yahweh provided their needs with a visitation of quail, driven there by a mighty wind.  Some, being unthankful and consumed with lust in their eating, were struck with a plague by Yahweh. 11:33 

The introduction of the quail for food and the response of Moshe to the judgment that is meted out upon the Israelites gives us a real sense of Moshe’s heart and love for the children of Israel.  At this point in the sojourn, Moshe is literally ready to offer his life for the needs of his fellow Israelites.  Then the Holy One interjects the methodology that He wants to help divide the leadership responsibilities among the seventy elders who are chosen for the continuation of the journey to the Promised Land. 

“The name of that place was called Kivrot-Hatta’avah, because there they buried the people who lusted.&quot;(HNV) - Kirvot-Hatta’avah means “the graves of lust”. Here it says that those who lusted were buried there. Lust is not the same thing as desire. Lust is something that cannot be satisfied, something animalistic and demonic, that is not based on natural needs. Lust is a twisted desire that demands without gratefulness, without humility, and without acknowledgment. 


&lt;u&gt;Seventy Elders&lt;/u&gt;

Yahweh instructed Moshe to gather seventy men from the elders of Israel upon whom He would place some of the spirit which was upon him, to help bear the burden of the people.  (Bamidbar/Numbers11:16-17). 

Seventy is a divine number of perfection and has some very profound implications - many ordinances are in seventies.  For example, according to the sages of Israel, seventy represents the number of primary nations. When Jacob went to Egypt, he took  seventy souls (Deut.10:22 - 11:1). It is the number of silver shekels the different tribal leaders offered up to Yahweh as the altar was being dedicated (Nu. 7),  There were seventy years of exile from the  Land of Israel.   Yeshua, He appointed seventy of His disciples to go to the nations to evangelise Luke 10:1-2).  There are the seventy biblically-ordained holy days of the year: 52 Sabbaths, seven days of Passover, eight days of Sukkot and Shemini Atzeret, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and Shavuot.

This is similar to, but not the same as, the time when earlier in the book of Exodus Moshe was challenged by his father-in-law Jethro to appoint the seventy judges to help distribute the burden of judging between the many disputes of the people.  In these appointments of the judges, just like as the commissioning of the leaders of Israel, Moshe is to choose men of the highest qualifications. Then we discover that after Moshe chooses men that he “knew,” that the Holy One then was able to pour out His Spirit upon them.   In an incredible display of the Holy One’s grace toward His people, He places His Spirit upon the seventy elders who had been selected for leadership.   (The instructions for elders and deacons in the new order are actually amplifications of these character traits.  Titus 1:5-9; 1 Tim. 3)

As a result, these men began to prophecy and make declarations to the others in the camp.  Apparently, as the account records, there were two men who were chosen to lead, but did not attend the initial outpouring of the Spirit upon the other sixty-eight.  All of a sudden within the camp, Eldad and Medad are found prophesying in the camp and Joshua comes and reports this activity to Moshe thinking that perhaps they were out of order. 

Moshe was delighted with the new administration.  In fact His comment that, “Would that all the Yahweh’s people were prophets, that Yahweh would put His Spirit upon them!” indicates that He was desiring all of Israel to be in a position to prophecy or speak the truth with clarity.   Moshe desired that all men would prophecy.  But he also wanted them all to be filled with the Holy Spirit, Who through them would do the prophesying.  This is available today as we submit our wills to His will.   As we seek to be led by the Spirit, we can let His words come forth from our inner most being and prophesy.  May this be the testimony for one and all!


&lt;u&gt;Evil Speaking&lt;/u&gt;

“And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moshe about the Kushite woman whom he had married... “   (12:1)

She was upset at Moshe’s actions which were based on Divine direction, that had him separate from an intimate matrimonial life. “(Miriam) said (to Aahron), ‘Was it only to Moshe that Yahweh spoke? Did He not speak to us, as well?&quot;(ibid v.3)  Evil speaking (Lashon Horah) is considered a terrible sin. The Torah has no less than 31 warnings concerning that crime, and it is incumbent upon believers to remember the story of Miriam as a daily reminder of the difficult test we face in our encounters and our oral reactions to them.   If we fail to avoid speaking lashon horah because of the pain that it inflicts upon our fellow believers,  then we should consider the pain we inflict upon our Father in Heaven when we talk ill of His children.  As long as we give in to gossip and slander we will grieve the Spirit/Ruach and will not advance spiritually. 
After harsh rebuke from the Almighty for the audacity to speak against her brother Moshe, the world’s greatest prophet and most humble man, Miriam was punished with leprosy. Her skin turned white as snow and was subjected to seven days of judgement. 

Prophetic people often allow a spirit of Jezebel (rebellion, personal ambition and usurpation of control) to rise up within them to usurp authority over those to whom Yahweh has given authority in the congregation of His people. Such people may use their prophetic giftings to try to direct the leadership through “words from the Lord.”  They will also attack leaders through accusation in areas unrelated to their ambitions. Miriam did this with Moshe by questioning his marriage, but her real ambition was to usurp control over Moshe.   (Targums Johnathan &amp; Jerusalem record that Moshe was married to a member of the royal household of Pharaoh.   Other Egyptian and historical records indicate that this was before he fled from Pharaoh and that she left with Israel at the time of the Exodus) 

Whatever, the issue is a criticism of Moshe elevating himself in his calling, above Mirium and Aaron, and a strong and powerful response by Yahweh for Mirium’s sin in rising up against against His anointed leadership.  

Speaking against Yahweh’s appointed leadership is never justified, even if there is reason for it, Yahweh Himself deals with His leaders.  The assembly’s commitment is to pray for them.  Mirium obviously lost the respect of the congregation as she was not mourned at her death as would have been usual for the anointed leadership and prophetic mantle she had carried previous to this incident.  Her death is only just mentioned for the record.  (Nu.20:1)

Now the only move seems to be 13...Ra7 but after 14 Nf3! Qxf6 15 Ne4 , Black's position seems to be collapsing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Shelach Lecha – Send Forth Yourself!  
Numbers/Bemidbar 13:1-15.41; Yehoshua 2:1-24;  Hebrews 3:1-4:16

This week the Torah portion continues to discuss some of the challenges that Israel has and will continue to have with leadership issues as the journey from Egypt to the Promised Land proceeds.  Having just witnessed in the previous portion the threat to his leadership coming from his sister Miriam and brother Aaron, Moshe is now placed in a position to continue encouraging the children of Israel to move forward on the journey toward the ultimate goal of securing the land promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.  It is at this point that the portion begins with the infamous incidents concerning the adventures of the twelve spies who were chosen to scout out the land and return with a report about the prospects for the invasion.  

“Send out for yourself men so that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I am going to give to the sons of Israel; you shall send a man from each of their fathers’ tribes, every one a leader among them”  (Bamidbar/Numbers 13:2). 

This section of the Torah dealing with sending the spies to the land of Canaan is just after the section of Miriam’s speaking evil (lashon hara) about Moshe. The spies comments about the land also came into the category of ‘lashan hara’ (evil speech) for they spoke against Yahweh Himself.  They denigrated His character, His wisdom and love for them in sending them into this situation.

Yahweh had declared the Land of Canaan (Promised Land) to be good, the people were unable to take his word at face value, but they felt the need to “confirm” Yahweh’s word by sending up “spies” to verify the accuracy of his word.  Scripture labels the Children of Yisrael as a faithless, hard-hearted and unbelieving generation causing the anger of Yahweh to burn against them. Their attitude prevented them from entering the Promised Land  (Heb. 4:1-7).

As Yahweh had already proclaimed that the Israelites would take the land, there was no real need for “spies” to be sent – yet He allows this, using the phrase, “Send for YOURSELF,” as if distancing Himself from this command. This phrase indicate Yahweh’s disappointment with them in seeking to operate according to their own understanding and their own methods.

Yahweh did not choose the 12 spies, the people did; hence, the name of the parashah, “Send for yourselves” When people choose their own leaders the failure rate is high, in this case 10 of 12 leaders were faithless. The word “nasi” for leader derives from the root word “nasa”, which means “raised” or “elevated.” Thus, the phrase “kal nasi bahem” means that the heart of each one elevated him to volunteer to participate - they were from leaders with fifty men under them.

Man-inspired, initiated efforts seldom produce lasting spiritual benefits.   Are you hearing the voice of the Ruach (Spirit) so that you know what your personal spiritual marching orders are.  We need to hear his voice and walk in faith based upon His Word.  Failure to do so makes us inconsistent in our walk and unable to inherit the promises. 


&lt;u&gt;Going Into the Land&lt;/u&gt;

In their journey, complaints and murmuring are commonplace.  In spite of the miraculous interventions resolving the water and diet issues, the children of Israel are constantly looking at the “half empty glass” rather than reveling in the “half full” one.  Human nature continues to drive the great majority of the people, as the instincts of survival and selfishness prevail. 

This is quite a dilemma for Moshe, who in his desire to fulfill the call upon his life, simply wants to obey the Holy One of Israel and guide the children of Israel to the prophesied return to Canaan.  So with the Promised Land on the horizon, the Holy One instructs Moshe to choose one leader from among each of the twelve tribes who will go into the Land and come back with a report to endorse the incursion.  God already promised the people he would give them the land: “I will send My terror ahead of you, and throw into confusion all the people among whom you come, and I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you. I will send hornets ahead of you so that they will drive out the Hivites, the Canaanites, and the Hittites before you.” (Exodus 23:27-28).  

When the twelve scouts entered the land they came to the brook of Eshcol, and cut down a branch with one cluster of grapes which was so large that they needed to bear it between two upon a rod and they also took of the pomegranates, and of the figs and they returned from searching of the land after forty days.  And they came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the Children of Yisrael, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh and brought back word to them and showed them the fruit of the land and they told them,  “We came unto the land where you sent us, and surely it flows with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it. Nevertheless, the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.”   (first mentioned in Gen. 6: 4 - the product of the ‘fallen ones’)

The report of the spies which resulted from their 40 day inspection of the land was negative, as only two of the twelve chosen leaders actually returned with a good report.  The other ten got hung up on the often-used word that is heard frequently by leaders when they are attempting to direct a group.  That word is the preposition “but” or “nevertheless. “
“Thus they said, ‘We went in to the land where you sent us; and it certainly does flow with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.  Nevertheless,the people who live in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large; and moreover,we saw the descendants of Anak there.  Amalek is living in the land of the Negev and the Hittites and the Jebusites and the Amorites are living in the hill country, and the Canaanites are living by the sea and by the side of the Jordan”  (Bamidbar/Numbers13:27-29). 

The commentators in the Stone Edition Chumash say regarding their assessment that “It is a land which devours its inhabitants”13:32, “Such misinterpretations are typical of people who choose not to have faith. Invariably they interpret events in a way that will conform to their own notions” (p. 803).  Having faith in Yahweh is a conscious choice that one has to make.  Faith does not come automatically.  Fear, doubt and unbelief do, however, and is part of the fallen nature or evil inclination that all men possess.  Is this not what Paul is referring to in Romans 8:1 when he speaks of the “law of sin and death”?  It is to be contrasted with the “law of the Spirit of life in Messiah Yeshua” through whom we are more than conquerors (Rom. 8:37).  First John 5:4 says, “For whatever is born of Elohim overcomes the world: and this is the victory that overcomes the world, even our faith [i.e. Yeshua, the Author and Finisher of our faith, the One who gives us the gift of faith, the One in whom we have faith and on whose words and promises believers stand firm and secure as a house built on a Rock].”  Fear of death is the mother of all fears and is what plagued the disbelieving Israelites. 

The spies, who were leaders from each of the twelve tribes, were not overtaken by giants in the land, neither were they devoured by the land after forty days within it.  What they permitted to enter into their hearts was fear and a lack of faith.  Not enough faith to believe that Yahweh has weapons of mass destruction at His disposal.  The ten with the evil report sized up the giants they saw, and in effect said that our God is too small.  They chose to stand with insurrection rather than bend their knees in obeisance to Yahweh.  If we would just yield to His way and not our own ways, what great deeds He could perform in our lives. 

When the ten come back with the bad report, immediately the infection of doubt and disbelief permeates the camp in spite of the fact that the evidence of the fruit which they bring back, testifies to the goodness of the land and the truth of Yahweh’s word.  Insurrection is on the rise as the people murmur, complain and ask for a leader to take them back to Egypt.  The men of faith, Caleb and Joshua, attempted to encourage the people, but the power of unbelief prevailed over them. Caleb had difficulty restraining them from their rebellion when giving his report. For this Yahweh rebuked them (Ch.14:11-12), and Moshe had to intercede for them in verses 13 to 20.  It is at this point that Moshe and Aaron give all leaders a second example of how a leader should react when confronted by his followers.  Their mutiny causes Moshe and now even his brother Aaron fall on their faces in prayer and supplication to the Most High.  There is no other place to turn but to the mercy of God. 

After the sin of believing the report of the 10 spies, the people are told they will not enter the land. Following this, some of them decided to “repent.”  They rebelled against Moses and Aaron (Numbers 14:1-10); and afterward despite the dire warning from Yahweh, the people remorsefully feel that it is their duty to correct their wrongs, and foolishly attempt to instead take the land by force. They are met with disaster and disappointment in the rash attack against the Amalekites and Canaanites which was repulsed from Kadesh (Numbers 14:40-45) causing them to be attacked and killed. True humility is required in seeking God’s will in true repentance, a change from following one’s own direction to true obedience whatever the cost.

The night that the people chose to follow their false report was the Ninth of Av., the same day as they worshipped the Golden Calf and it was then that He predicted that they would be scattered among the nations.   Psalm 106:24-27 cites the ominous prediction and its far-reaching effects that continue to the present day.  This began a cycle from which they have reaped up till the present time.  Many national tragedies occurred on this date and it has become a day of national mourning ( Zechariah 8:19).   This date, the 9th Av, falling in July/August, was also the date of the destruction of the first and second temples.  In 1492, the Jews were expelled from Spain on this date. War I also broke out on the Ninth of Av. World War II (with the Holocaust) was very much a continuation of the First World War.    Galatians 6:7-10

Through identification with Yeshua’s death, burial and resurrection at baptism (Romans 6:3-6) we too (through Yeshua) can be victorious over the sting of death and the grave which is the death sentence upon all Torah lawbreaking mortals. Read 1 Corinthians 15:47-58.   

Today there is a generation who are being called to enter the &quot;promised land&quot; by faith and are being given a vision of the good land and its blessings.  Will we rise up and declare that we are well able to overcome the giants of the forces of darkness and make our calling and election sure or shall we fail the test and fall in the wilderness.   There must be a purging of the flesh, a remnant who will overcome and be presented before the presence of His glory without spot or blemish or any such fleshly thing.


&lt;u&gt;The Assessment of the Land&lt;/u&gt;

When searching out the land, they went from the wilderness of Zin to the northernmost regions surveying the whole extent of the land.   Eschol the small wadi from where they took the grapes seems to be identified as Burj Haskeh today, about two miles north of Hebron.  The mission was begun in the days “of first-ripe grapes” which would be mid to late July.   They returned on 9th Av.

The fruit of the land which they brought back with them from a more accurate rendering of the Hebrew,  reads: “And they cut from there one pruning with [lit. “and”] a cluster of grapes, and they carried [it / them] on a pole between the two — with [lit. “and from”] the pomegranates and figs.”  Keeping these fruits on their branches to extend their freshness, adds a new dimension. When we consider two men loading up a pole with a pruning having a remarkably large cluster of grapes plus prunings with pomegranates and prunings with figs then we have a pole laden with fruit that would understandably have to be carried by two men. 

The (root) verb shoresh (tur) used here, means to reconnoiter, explore and investigate (13.2, 17).  
This was the commission they had been given  -   to investigate  
1. What the land was  -  
2. Whether the people in it were few or many, strong or weak   -  
3. Whether the land is good or bad  -   
4.  If the town were open or fortified   -   
5. If the soil was rich or poor and -  
6. Samples of its produce.  An extensive survey was to be undertaken.   


This fact-finding mission took in two aspects, and they were  -  

1.  The nature of the land itself and the 

2.  Prospects of military conquest
The land was undeniably good, but it needed faith to conquer it from the usurping enemies.   It was given to them, but they had to take possession of it to make it their own.  This parallels our spiritual inheritance, there are obstacles and spiritual enemies to overcome if we would take the land.   We also need to enter into the inheritance given to us and make it a reality in our lives.

In verse 22 it reads in the original ‘he’ went up through the south (the Negev) and came to Hebron.  This is understood to refer to Caleb who went this far (Sotah 34b; Rashi; Rashbam).  His heart was obviously toward the patriarchs and what had been promised them.  He believed Yahweh’s Word.
The Chumash tells us that Caleb was the son of Chetzron mentioned in 1 Chronicles 2:9 (Yerushalmi, Yevamoth 10:7), and was thus a great-grandson of Judah (cf. Genesis 46:12; Numbers 13:30, 14:6, etc).  He was 40 years old at the time (Joshua 14:6,7).  He was the step-brother of Othniel son of Kenaz (Joshua 15:17; Sotah 11b).  Caleb married Miriam and was the father of Hur (Chur  -1 Chronicles 2:19,20; Targum ad loc; Sifri).  He also married Bithia, the daughter of Pharaoh who raised Moshe (Megillah 13a, from 1 Chronicles 4:18 - also see 1 Chronicles 2:42-50, 4:15).

The Amalekites lived in the Negev.  the Hittites of that era lived near Hebron.  The Jebusites lived near Jerusalem.  The Amorites were somewhat nomadic but centred around the area of Syria.  The Canaanites lived in the lowland regions of the country.


&lt;u&gt;The Nature of the Land&lt;/u&gt;

In this Torah portion the land of Israel is referred to as a land flowing with milk and honey (14:8). This term appears in about twenty additional places in the Bible and in the words of the prophets.  Almost always the term refers to the Land of Israel, except for one occasion, when the followers of Korach use it to refer to Egypt (Nu.16:13). The term is used to emphasize the wealth of produce of the land, but the exact nature of the ‘honey’ mentioned in it needs further examination.

From the Bible we know that ancient peoples commonly collected bees honey from their hives, which were often among rocks (Nu.32:13) or among the trees in the forest (1 Samuel 14:25-27). Sometimes bees even found hiding places in the carcasses of animals, such as in the story of Samson (Judges 14:8).  The hot climate in Israel often melted the honeycombs and caused the sweet fluid to flow over the ground, a phenomenon which can be described as a land flowing with milk and honey.

However, according to most researchers this verse refers to the sweet nectar which drips from fruit such as grapes, carobs, figs or dates. Therefore, for example, the date is mentioned among the seven species that the land of Israel is blessed with, in the following language: a land of wheat and barley, grape and fig and pomegranate; a land of olive oil and honey (Nu. 8:8). If the fruit is not harvested in time, its juices begin to drip out, thereby enabling the land to be seen as flowing with honey.  A description of the future in the words of the prophet Joel (4:18),  And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains will drip with nectar and the hills will flow with milk, teaches that prophet probably understood the previous phrase flowing with milk and honey as deal with the nectar of fruits.  The land is precious to Yahweh.  See Deuteronomy 11:12 


&lt;u&gt;The Issue of Obedience&lt;/u&gt;

Israel tested Yahweh ten times and refused to heed His voice.  According to the rabbis these ten times were: Exodus 14:11; 15:24; 16:3; 16:20; 16:27; 17:2; 32:4; Numbers 11:1; 11:4; and here (believing the spies’ evil report).   In each of these incidents Israel “tested” Yahweh and preferred to walk in doubt and unbelief rather than trust His word. 

These are examples for us to learn from that we do not follow in their ways.  (1 Corinthians 10:11)
“Don’t delude yourselves: no one makes a fool of God! A person reaps what he sows. Those who keep sowing in the field of their old nature, in order to meet its demands, will eventually reap ruin; but those who keep sowing in the field of the Spirit will reap from the Spirit everlasting life. So let us not grow weary of doing what is good; for if we don’t give up, we will in due time reap the harvest. Therefore, as the opportunity arises, let us do what is good to everyone, and especially to the family of those who are trustingly faithful.”   Galatians 6: 7-10

Today, as the Holy One is raising up godly, Torah obedient followers of the Messiah, He is challenging each and every one of us to exemplify faith and willingness to submit our wills to the will of the Father.  He is training us to crucify our flesh in order for the guiding power of the Holy Spirit to operate effectively through each and everyone of us.  As we learn to be led by the Spirit and to walk by the Spirit, we find that the “buts” become fewer and fewer as we submit our wills to His.  If we have a heart to obey out of love for our Father, fear will be overcome, for there is no fear in love (1 John 4:18)   We only fear when we do not trust Him.   But, if we unite ourselves with His purposes, then we are one with Him in spirit and He can fill us with His presence which will make us bold and courageous.   Withdrawing in fear concerning standing for His values and principles comes down to unbelief in Him (Hebrews 3:12-14).  This is not to say that we understand all that the Father is requiring of us as we walk out our various calls.  But we do know that He has a desire to use each one of His children in the unique circumstances where they are placed.  His basic principles do not change.  He has indicated that as we are faithful in the little things like learning to serve others, or in Moshe’s case, learning to serve sheep and then the nation of Israel, He is faithful to give us even greater things to serve.
 
“He who is faithful in the least, is faithful also in much; and he who in the least is unrighteous, is also unrighteous in much; If therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will entrust the true riches to you? And if you have not been faithful in that which is another’s, who will give you that which is your own?” (Luke 16:10-12). 

Two types of sin are delineated in 15:27-31: the sin of ignorance and the sin of presumption (i.e., willful sinning, or literally, “sinning with a high hand”).  For the first sin there is an offering or atonement. For the second sin, the penalty is death as illustrated by the example of the Sabbath-breaker in verses 32-36.  It is interesting to note that breaking the Sabbath is the example used to illustrate the second sin.  This reveals Yahweh’s high regard for Shabbat.  No one could be judged unless they were first warned of their sin by two or three witnesses, and had disregarded the warning.


&lt;u&gt;The Gracious Provisions
&lt;/u&gt;
At this time Yahweh tells Moshe to teach them two commandments intended for their uplifting.

1. Wine libations (1-16).
The wine libation is poured out and not drunk.  Paul compared his own life to a wine libation poured out over the altar on two different occasions. He first did so in his early letter to the Philippians; the other instance is in one of his last letters, 2 Timothy.

Yeshua Himself, on taking the cup of His last seder meal, says, “This cup which is poured out for you is the new covenant in My blood.” (Luke 22:20)  In Mark He says His blood is “poured out for many,” (Mark 14:24) and in Matthew He adds that it is poured out “for forgiveness of sins.” (Matthew 26:28).  His blood which was poured out on the ground like water and like a drink offering upon the altar.  It was not a waste.  It was about one quart in volume.

2. Challah (17-21).
“Challah” is the separation of a portion of dough, which is then given as an offering to Yahweh and as a gift to the Priests.   Each day then they were to take from their bread, the staple of life and make an offering to Him.

This provision is carried over in the new covenant as the ordinance of communion (bread and wine).   Through this we draw near unto God and partake of His life in Yeshua the Messiah.   By coming with an offering and entering into covenant relationship and communion their spiritual life was sustained.   
The basics of this mitzvah for the Challah (traditional ‘communion’ bread) are as follows: If one makes a batch of dough from one of the five grains (wheat, barley, rye, oats, spelt) that is equal to the omer of manna each person received in the desert (2 quarts - one day’s worth of food - 43.2 eggs in volume), then he must separate a small portion (Challah).  The remainder of the then dough becomes fit for use, and the separated Challah is given to the Kohen.  Like other forms of offerings (Terumah), the Torah does not set any minimum size for the Challah.  If one forgets to “take Challah” from the dough, it must be taken from the baked bread.   (Bamidbar 15:17-21)
This is the traditional bread that is used today every Shabbat.

The Jerusalem Talmud (Challah 2:1) says, that when Yehoshua led the people into the land they discovered flour abandoned by the fleeing Canaanites, and then combined some with water to make a dough.   “And they ate of the produce of the land on the day after Pesach, matzot and parched grain, on that same day” (Yehoshua 5:11).

This scripture section ends with a further provision in the form of the tzitzits, which were to serve as a continual reminder of His commandments.  These were provisions to keep them on the path of life.
In 15:37-41 Yahweh commands them to wear tzitzit (tassels - Tzitzith in Hebrew). Also see Deuteronomy 22:12. 

The tzitzith-tassels consist of four strings doubled over so that eight strings appear to hang from each corner (Menachoth 39b). There is also an area where a single string is wound around the other seven, consisting of one-third of the tassel (Menachoth 39a). This must be held in place by a knot (Yevamoth 4a, b). The custom is that there be five knots and four areas of winding on each tzitzith-tassel (Targum Yonathan). The prevailing custom is that these wound areas have respectively 7, 8, 11 and 13 windings and amount to 613 altogether which is the collective amount of all the commandments in scripture.

== make a prymaid==
with versions 2.46 of Blender and later, you just have to select merge at center after the merge vertices step to create a pyramid, the last 3 steps aren't needed.

you can do this easier by making the top vertices closer to each other (SKEY)
and then use Remove Double (in editing buttons/Mesh tools tab)

== Noob needs context. ==

As a total Noob just reading the whole book from front to back, I was completely lost when I reached this tutorial. I now think that the &quot;guide image&quot; approach is an advanced technique that uses the &quot;background image&quot; feature in a novel way. (This is really neat, by the way.) However, this is the very first place I found in the whole book that mentions background images.

I feel that the concept of background images and their normal use needed to be explained before we tell users how to use them in an unorthodox manner, and I have done so. However, I'm a Noob, so my change needs to be reviewed. -[[User:Arch dude|Arch dude]] ([[User talk:Arch dude|talk]]) 08:57, 8 December 2010 (UTC)</text>

The factory pattern is a design pattern used to promote encapsulation of data representation.
; Problem : We want to decide at run time what object is to be created based on some configuration or application parameter. When we write the code we do not know what class should be instantiated.  
; Solution : Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses. It's primary purpose is to provide a way for users to retrieve an instance with a known compile-time type, but whose runtime type may actually be different. In other words, a factory method that is supposed to return an instance of the class ''Foo'' may return an instance of the class ''Foo'', or it may return an instance of the class ''Bar'', so long as ''Bar'' inherits from ''Foo''. The reason for this is that it strengthens the boundary between implementor and client, hiding the true representation of the data (see Abstraction Barrier) from the user, thereby allowing the implementor to change this representation at anytime without affecting the client, as long as the client facing interface doesn't change.
== Basic Implementation of the Factory Pattern ==
The general template for implementing the factory pattern is to provide a primary user facing class with static methods which the user can use to get instances with that type. Constructors are then made private/protected from the user, forcing them to use the static factory methods to get objects. The following [[Java]] code shows a very simple implementation of the factory pattern for type ''Foo''.
&lt;source lang=&quot;java5&quot;&gt;
public class Foo {
  // Static factory method
  public static Foo getInstance() {
    // Inside this class, we have access to private methods
    return new Foo();
  }
  // Guarded constructor, only accessible from within this class, since it's marked private
  private Foo() {
    // Typical initialization code goes here
  }
} // End class Foo
&lt;/source&gt;
With this code, it would be impossible for a client of the code to use the '''new''' operator to get an instance of the class, as is traditionally done:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java5&quot;&gt;
// Client code
Foo f = new Foo(); // Won't Work!
&lt;/source&gt;
because the constructor is marked ''private''. Instead, the client would have to use the factory method:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java5&quot;&gt;
// Client code
Foo f = Foo.getInstance(); // Works!
&lt;/source&gt;
It should be noted that even within a programming language community, there is no general consensus as to the naming convention of a factory method. Some suggest naming the method with the name of the class, similar to a normal constructor, but starting with a lowercase. Others say that this is confusing, and suggest using an accessor type syntax, like the ''getInstance'' style used above, though others complain that this may incorrectly imply a singleton implementation. Likewise, some offer ''newInstance'', but this is criticized as being misleading in certain situations where a strictly ''new'' instance may not actually be returned (once again, refer to the singleton pattern). As such, we will not attempt to follow any particularly rigid standard here, we will simply try to use a name that makes the most sense for our current purposes.
== Factory Pattern Implementation of the Alphabet ==
That's great, you know how to implement a real simple factory pattern, but what good did it do you? Users are asking for something that fits into type ''Foo'', and they're getting an instance of the class ''Foo'', how is that different from just calling the constructor? Well it's not, except that you're putting another function call on the stack (which is a bad thing). But that's only for the above case. We'll now discuss a more useful use of the factory pattern.
Consider a simple type called ''Letter'', representing a letter in the alphabet, which has the following client facing interface (i.e., public instance methods):
&lt;source lang=&quot;java5&quot;&gt;
char toCharacter();
boolean isVowel();
boolean isConsonant();
&lt;/source&gt;
We could implement this easily enough without using the factory method, which might start out something like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java5&quot;&gt;
public class Letter {
  private char fTheLetter;
  public Letter(char aTheLetter) {
    fTheLetter = aTheLetter;
  }
  public char toCharacter() {
    return fTheLetter;
  }
  public boolean isVowel() {
    //TODO: we haven't implemented this yet
    return true;
  }
  public boolean isConsonant() {
    // TODO: we haven't implemented this yet
    return false;
  }
} // End class Letter
&lt;/source&gt;
Fairly simple, but notice we haven't implemented the last two methods yet. We can still do it pretty easily. The first might look like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java5&quot;&gt;
  public boolean isVowel() {
    return
      fTheLetter == 'a' ||
      fTheLetter == 'e' ||
      fTheLetter == 'i' ||
      fTheLetter == 'o' ||
      fTheLetter == 'u' ||
      fTheLetter == 'A' ||
      fTheLetter == 'E' ||
      fTheLetter == 'I' ||
      fTheLetter == 'O' ||
      fTheLetter == 'U';
  }
&lt;/source&gt;
Now that's not ''too'' bad, but we still need to do ''isConsonant''. Fortunately, we at least know in this case that if it's a vowel, it's not a consonant, and vice versa, so our last method could simply be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java5&quot;&gt;
  public boolean isConsonant() {
    return !this.isVowel();
  }
&lt;/source&gt;
So what's the problem here? Basically, every time you call either of these methods, your program has to do all that checking. Granted, this isn't a real heavy burden for the Java Runtime Environment, but you can imagine a much more complex, much more time consuming operation. Wouldn't it be great if we could avoid doing this every time we call the method? Let's say, for instance, we could do it once when we create the object, and then not have to do it again. Well sure, we can do that. Here's an implementation that'll do that for us, and we still don't have to use the factory method:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java5&quot;&gt;
public class Letter {
  private char fTheLetter;
  private boolean fIsVowel;
  public Letter(char aTheLetter) {
    fTheLetter = aTheLetter;
    fIsVowel = fTheLetter == 'a' ||
      fTheLetter == 'e' ||
      fTheLetter == 'i' ||
      fTheLetter == 'o' ||
      fTheLetter == 'u' ||
      fTheLetter == 'A' ||
      fTheLetter == 'E' ||
      fTheLetter == 'I' ||
      fTheLetter == 'O' ||
      fTheLetter == 'U';
  }
  public char toCharacter() {
    return fTheLetter;
  }
  public boolean isVowel() {
    return fIsVowel;
  }
  public boolean isConsonant() {
    return !fIsVowel;
  }
} // End class Letter
&lt;/source&gt;
Notice how we moved the lengthy operation into the constructor, and stored the result. OK, so now we're all fine and dandy, no? Sure, but let's say you came up with a new idea, a different implementation: you want to split this type into two classes, one class to handle the vowels, and one to handle the consonants. Great, they can both be subclasses of the ''Letter'' class, and the user will never know the difference, right? Wrong. How is the client supposed to get at these new classes? They've got code that works perfectly well for them by calling ''new Letter('a')'' and ''new Letter('Z')''. Now you're going to make them go through all their code and change these to ''new Vowel('a')'' and ''new Consonant('Z')''? They probably won't be too happy with that. If only you could get new instances of both classes from one method! Well you can, just use a static method in the ''Letter'' class, it'll do the same one-time checking as the constructor did, and will return an appropriate instance of the right class. And what do you know, it's a factory method! But that still doesn't do your client much good, they still need to go through and change all the ''new Letter()''s into ''Letter.getLetter()''.
Well, sad to say, it's too late to help them at all, unless you just give up your new implementation. But that illustrates the reason for using the factory method right off the bat. One of the key components of good object oriented programming is that you never know exactly where your code will go in the future. By making good use of the abstraction barrier and using encapsulation-friendly programming patterns, such as the factory pattern, you can better prepare yourself&amp;mdash;and your client&amp;mdash;for future changes to the specific implementation. In particular, it allows you to use a &quot;big hammer&quot; kind of approach to get something done in a perhaps-less-than-ideal but rapid manner in order to meet deadlines or move ahead with testing,. You can then go back later and refine the implementation&amp;mdash;the data representation and algorithms&amp;mdash;to be faster, smaller, or what-have-you, and as long as you maintained the abstraction barrier between implementor and client and properly encapsulated your implementation, then you can change it without requiring the client to change any of their code.
Well now that I'm sure you're a raving advocate for the factory method, let's take a look at how we would implement it for our ''Letter'' type:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java5&quot;&gt;
public abstract class Letter {
 
// Factory Method
 public static Letter getLetter(char aTheLetter) {
 // Like before, we do a one time check to see what kind of
 // letter we are dealing with. Only this time, instead of setting
 // a property to track it, we actually have a different class for each
 // of the two letter types.
 if (
 aTheLetter == 'a' ||
 aTheLetter == 'e' ||
 aTheLetter == 'i' ||
 aTheLetter == 'o' ||
 aTheLetter == 'u' ||
 aTheLetter == 'A' ||
 aTheLetter == 'E' ||
 aTheLetter == 'I' ||
 aTheLetter == 'O' ||
 aTheLetter == 'U'
 ) {
   return new Vowel(aTheLetter);
 } else {
   return new Consonant(aTheLetter);
 }
 }
 
 
// User facing interface
// We make these methods abstract, thereby requiring all subclasses
// (actually, just all concrete subclasses, that is, non-abstract)
// to implement the methods.
 public abstract boolean isVowel();
 
 public abstract boolean isConsonant();
 
 public abstract char getChar();
 
 
 // Now we define the two concrete classes for this type,
 // the ones that actually implement the type.
 private static class Vowel extends Letter {
 private char iTheLetter;
 
 // Constructor
 Vowel(char aTheLetter) {
 this.iTheLetter = aTheLetter;
 }
 
 // Nice easy implementation of this method!
 public boolean isVowel() {
 return true;
 }
 
 // This one, too!
 public boolean isConsonant() {
 return false;
 }
 public char getLetter(){
   return iTheLetter;
 }
 } // End local class Vowel
 private static class Consonant extends Letter {
 private char iTheLetter;
 
 // Constructor
 Consonant(char aTheLetter) {
   this.iTheLetter = aTheLetter;
 }
 
 public boolean isVowel() {
   return false;
 }
 
 public boolean isConsonant(){
   return true;
 }
 public char getLetter(){
   return iTheLetter;
 }
 } // End local class Consonant
 
} // End toplevel class Letter
&lt;/source&gt;
Several things to note here.
* First, you'll notice the top level class ''Letter'' is abstract. This is fine because you'll notice that it doesn't actually do anything except define the interface and provide a top level container for the two other classes. However, it's also ''important'' (not just OK) to make this abstract because we don't want people trying to instantiate the ''Letter'' class directly. Of course we could solve this problem by making a private constructor, but making the class abstract instead is cleaner, and makes it more obvious that the ''Letter'' class is not '''meant''' to be instantiated. It also, as mentioned, allows us to define the user facing interface that the work horse classes need to implement.
* The two nested classes we created are called '''local''' classes, which is basically the same as an '''inner''' class except that local classes are static, and inner classes are not. They have to be static so that our static factory method can create them. If they were non static (i.e., dynamic) then they could only be accessed through an instance of the ''Letter'' class, which we can never have because ''Letter'' is abstract. Also note that (in Java, anyway) the fields for inner and local classes typically use the &quot;i&quot; (for inner) prefix, as opposed to the &quot;f&quot; (for field) prefix used by top level classes. This is simply a naming convention used by many Java programmers and doesn't actually effect the program.
* The two nested classes that implement the ''Letter'' data type do not actually have to be local/inner. They could just have easily been top level classes that extend the abstract ''Letter'' class. However, this is contrary to the point of the factory pattern, which is encapsulation. Top level classes can't be private in Java, because that doesn't make any sense (what are they private to?) and the whole point is that no client has to (or should, really) know how the type is implemented. Making these classes top level allows clients to potentially stumble across them, and worse yet, instantiate them, by-passing the factory pattern all together.
* Lastly, this is not very good code. There's a lot of ways we can make it better to really illustrate the power of the factory pattern. I'll discuss these refactorings briefly, and then show another, more polished, version of the above code which includes a lot of them.
=== Refactoring the Factory Pattern ===
Notice that both of the local classes do the same thing in a few places. This is redundant code which is not only more work to write, but it's also highly discouraged in object oriented programming (partially '''because''' it takes more work to write, but mostly because it's harder to maintain and prone to errors, e.g., you find a bug in the code and change it in one spot, but forget to in another.) Below is a list of redundancies in the above code:
* The field ''iTheLetter''
* The method ''getLetter()''
* The constructor of each inner class does the same thing.
In addition, as we discovered above, the isVowel() and isConsonant() just happen to always return the opposite of each other for a given instance. However, since this is something of a peculiarity for this particular example, we won't worry about it. The lesson you would learn from us doing that will already be covered in the refactoring of the ''getLetter()'' method.
OK, so we have redundant code in two classes. If you're familiar with abstracting processes, then this is probably a familiar scenario to you. Often, having redundant code in two different classes makes them prime candidates for abstraction, meaning that a new abstract class is created to implement the redundant code, and the two classes simply extend this new abstract class instead of implementing the redundant code. Well what do you know? We already have an abstract super class that our redundant classes have in common. All we have to do is make the super class implement the redundant code, and the other classes will automatically inherit this implementation, as long as we don't override it.
So that works fine for the ''getLetter()'' method, we can move both the method and the ''iTheLetter'' field up to the abstract parent class. But what about the constructors? Well our constructor takes an argument, so we won't automatically inherit it, that's just the way java works. But we can use the '''super''' keyword to automatically delegate to the super classes constructor. In other words, we'll implement the constructor in the super class, since that's where the field is anyway, and the other two classes will delegate to this method in their own constructors. For our example, this doesn't save much work, we're replacing a one line assignment with a one line call to '''super()''', but in theory, there could be hundred of lines of code in the constructors, and moving it up could be a great help.
At this point, you might be a little worried about putting a constructor in the ''Letter'' class. Didn't I already say not to do that? I thought we didn't want people trying to instantiate ''Letter'' directly? Don't worry, the class is still abstract. Even if there's a concrete constructor, Java won't let you instantiate an abstract class, because it's abstract, it could have method that are accessible but undefined, and it wouldn't know what to do if such a method was invoked. So putting the constructor in is fine.
After making the above refactorings, our code now looks like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java5&quot;&gt;
public abstract class Letter {
 
// Factory Method
 public static Letter getLetter(char aTheLetter){
 if (
 aTheLetter == 'a' ||
 aTheLetter == 'e' ||
 aTheLetter == 'i' ||
 aTheLetter == 'o' ||
 aTheLetter == 'u' ||
 aTheLetter == 'A' ||
 aTheLetter == 'E' ||
 aTheLetter == 'I' ||
 aTheLetter == 'O' ||
 aTheLetter == 'U'
 ) {
   return new Vowel(aTheLetter);
 } else {
   return new Consonant(aTheLetter);
 }
 }
 
 
 // Our new abstracted field. We'll make it protected so that subclasses can see it,
 // and we rename it from &quot;i&quot; to &quot;f&quot;, following our naming convention.
 protected char fTheLetter;
 
 
 // Our new constructor. It can't actually be used to instantiate an instance
 // of Letter, but our sub classes can invoke it with super
 protected Letter(char aTheLetter) {
 this.fTheLetter = aTheLetter;
 }
 
 // The new method we're abstracting up to remove redundant code in the sub classes
 public char getChar() {
 return this.fTheLetter;
 }
 // Same old abstract methods that define part of our client facing interface
 public abstract boolean isVowel();
 
 public abstract boolean isConsonant();
 
 
 
 // The local subclasses with the redundant code moved up.
 
 private static class Vowel extends Letter {
 
 // Constructor delegates to the super constructor
 Vowel(char aTheLetter) {
   super(aTheLetter);
 }
 
 // Still need to implement the abstract methods
 public boolean isVowel()  {
   return true;
 }
 
 public boolean isConsonant(){
   return false;
 }
 } // End local class Vowel
 
 
 private static class Consonant extends Letter {
 
 Consonant(char aTheLetter){
   super(aTheLetter);
 }
 
 public boolean isVowel(){
   return false;
 }
 
 public boolean isConsonant(){
   return true;
 }
 } // End local class Consonant
 
} // End toplevel class Letter
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that we made our abstracted field protected. This isn't strictly necessary in this case, we could have left it private, because the subclasses don't actually need to access it at all. In general, ''I'' prefer to make things protected instead of private, since, as I mentioned, you can never really be sure where a project will go in the future, and you may not want to restrict future implementors (including yourself) unnecessarily. However, many people prefer to default to private and only use protected when they know it's necessary. A major reason for this is the rather peculiar and somewhat unexpected meaning of '''protected''' in Java, which allows not only subclasses, but ''anything'' in the same package to access it. This is a bit of a digression, but I think it's a fairly important debate that a good Java programmer should be aware of.
== The Factory Pattern and Parametric Polymorphism ==
The version of the Java Virtual Machine 5.0 has introduced something called Parametric Polymorphism, which goes by many other names in other languages, including &quot;generic typing&quot; in C++. In order to really understand the rest of this section, you should read that section first. But basically, this means that you can introduce additional parameters into a class--parameters which are set at instantiation--that define the types of certain elements in the class, for instance fields or method return values. This is a very powerful tool which allows programmers to avoid a lot of those nasty '''instanceof'''s and narrowing castes. However, the implementation of this device in the JVM does not promote the use of the Factory pattern, and in the two do not play well together. This is because Java does not allow methods to be parameterized the way types are, so you cannot dynamically parameterize an instance through a method, only through use of the '''new''' operator. As an example, imagine a type ''Foo'' which is parameterized with a single type which we'll call ''T''. In java we would write this class like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java5&quot;&gt;
class Foo&lt;T&gt; {
} // End class Foo
&lt;/source&gt;
Now we can have instances of ''Foo'' parameterized by all sorts of types, for instance:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java5&quot;&gt;
Foo&lt;String&gt; fooOverString = new Foo&lt;String&gt;();
Foo&lt;Integer&gt; fooOverInteger = new Foo&lt;Integer&gt;();
&lt;/source&gt;
But let's say we want to use the factory pattern for ''Foo''. How do we do that? You could create a different factory method for each type you want to parameterize over, for instance:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java5&quot;&gt;
class Foo&lt;T&gt; {
  static Foo&lt;String&gt; getFooOverString() {
    return new Foo&lt;String&gt;();
  }
  static Foo&lt;Integer&gt; getFooOverInteger() {
    return new Foo&lt;Integer&gt;();
  }
} // End class Foo
&lt;/source&gt;
But what about something like the ''ArrayList'' class (in the java.util package)? In the java standard libraries released with 5.0, ArrayList is parameterized to define the type of the object stored in it. We certainly don't want to restrict what kinds of types it can be parameterized with by having to write a factory method for each type. This is often the case with parameterized types: you don't know what types users will want to parameterize with, and you don't want to restrict them, so the factory pattern won't work for that.
You are allowed to instantiate a parameterized type in a generic form, meaning you don't specify the parameter at all, you just instantiate it the way you would have before 5.0. But that forces you to give up the parameterization.
This is how you do it with generics:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java5&quot;&gt;
class Foo&lt;T&gt; {
  public static &lt;E&gt; Foo&lt;E&gt; getFoo() {
    return new Foo&lt;E&gt;();
  }
} // End class Foo
&lt;/source&gt;
== Examples ==
In Java, a class that implements &lt;code&gt;java.sql.Connection&lt;/code&gt; is a factory of statements. By calling the &lt;code&gt;createStatement()&lt;/code&gt; method, you create a statement for which you only know the interface. The factory chooses the right instance class for you.
== Cost ==
This pattern is not so expensive when it is implemented at the right time. It can be more expensive if you have to refactor an existing code.
=== Creation ===
Its implementation is easy and there is no additional cost (it is not more expensive than an implementation without this pattern).
=== Maintenance ===
There is no additional cost nor additional constraint.
=== Removal ===
This pattern can be easily removed as automatic refactoring operations can easily remove its existence.
== Advises ==
* Put the ''factory'' term in the name of the factory class to indicate the use of the pattern to the other developers.
== Implementation ==

&lt;/source&gt;
As in Perl, Common Lisp and other dynamic languages, factories of the above sort aren't really necessary, since classes are first-class objects and can be passed around directly, leading to this more natural version:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#
# Pizza
#
class Pizza(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self._price = None
    def get_price(self):
        return self._price
class HamAndMushroomPizza(Pizza):
    def __init__(self):
        self._price = 8.5
class DeluxePizza(Pizza):
    def __init__(self):
        self._price = 10.5
class HawaiianPizza(Pizza):
    def __init__(self):
        self._price = 11.5
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for pizza_class in (HamAndMushroomPizza, DeluxePizza, HawaiianPizza):
        print 'Price of {0} is {1}'.format(pizza_class.__name__, pizza_class().get_price())
&lt;/source&gt;
Note in the above that the classes themselves are simply used as values, which &lt;tt&gt;pizza_class&lt;/tt&gt; iterates over.  The class gets created simply by treating it as a function.  In this case, if &lt;tt&gt;pizza_class&lt;/tt&gt; holds a class, then &lt;tt&gt;pizza_class()&lt;/tt&gt; creates a new object of that class.
Another way of writing the final clause, which sticks more closely to the original example and uses strings instead of class objects, is as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{history of Hong Kong|stone=123}}
Everything has to have a beginning, including humanity. So far, the earliest confirmed date with ancient people in Hong Kong was around 4000BC. The lifestyles of those people were classified as neolithic: building houses by the sea and all that. Stone tools are not the only artefacts discovered: pottery, human skeletons and fossils, and many other things have been discovered.

Rock carvings are found in many places of Hong Kong. Most believe that they were used for religious rituals. The people of neolithic Hong Kong belonged to a group of people in South China who produced pottery with geometric patterns. Hong Kong, along with '''Qujiang''', are the two major archaeological sites.

== Rock carvings ==
[[File:Big Wave Bay Rock Carving 1.jpg|150px|thumb|right|The Big Wave Bay rock carving]]
Prehistoric Hong Kong people loved carving pictures on rocks. These '''rock carvings''' are probably for religious rituals that are carried out before the stone age people went fishing. The rock carvings have been spotted in numerous coastal regions including '''Cheung Chau''', '''Tung Lung Island''', '''Po Toi Island''' and '''Big Wave Bay'''.

Many of these rock carvivings are '''declared monuments''' of Hong Kong. A declared monument a place that is of historic value and is thus protected by the law. Monuments 1, 2, 5, 6, 14 and 16 are the rock carvings. For a complete list of them, please see [[w:Declared monuments|Wikipedia's list of declared monuments]].

== Geometric patterns ==
'''Pearl River (Chu Kong/Zhu Jiang)''' is a river that flows in South China. Hong Kong is located in the '''Pearl River (Chu Kong/Zhu Jiang) Delta'''. In the prehistoric times, Pearl River (Chu Kong/Zhu Jiang) is hot and wet, and filled with forests and swamps. This hot, humid, and swampy place is where a culture began. The culture, known is Chinese as 幾何印紋圖文化 (lit. 'imprint of geometric patterns culture'), covers the area of South China, including Kwong Tung (Guangdong) and Kwong Sai (Guangxi).

The culture was part of the '''Bak Yueh (Baiyue) culture''', which are ancient Cantonese people. Hong Kong being part of this culture, the pottery unearthed contains a distinctive specialty which is present in most of the pottery of this culture: geometric patterns, hence the name.

The pottery is mostly grey, brown and red. Some of the pottery was done by coiling (more about the technique on [[w:Coil#In_Ceramics_.28Fine_Arts.29|Wikipedia]]). Moulds with geometric patterns were also made to press on the pottery. Such geometric patterns include waves, rhombi and kui-dragon patterns.&lt;!--No idea what that means--&gt;

== [[../Introduction|Introduction]] ==
*Properties of matter
** Matter must have mass
** Matter must take up space

== [[../Matter|Matter]] ==
*Different kinds of matter
**Solids' shapes cannot be altered, and nor can its volume
**Liquids' shapes can be altered, but not its volume
**Gases' shapes can be altered, and so can its volume
*Change of states
**Solid → Liquid: Melting
***Happens at a fixed temperature
**Liquid → Solid: Freezing
***Happens at a fixed temperature
**Gas → Liquid: Condensation
***Does not happen at a fixed temperature
**Liquid → Gas: Boiling
***Happens at a fixed temperature
***Evaporation does not happen at a fixed temperature

==[[../Particle theory|Particle theory]] ==
* Matter is made of particles;
* Particles are infinitesimal, and current scientific instruments cannot see them;
* Different kinds of particles have different sizes;
* There must be gaps between particles
* Particles are always in motion.

==[[../Diffusion|Diffusion]]==
*A common phenomenon observed in particle movement
*Particles always go to a place of lower density

==[[../Brownian motion|Brownian motion]]==
*When particles collide, they move in random directions
*Observed in smoke cells
*Discovered by Robert Brown
**In 1827
**While observing pollen grains

==[[../Particle model|Particle model]]==
*A model that mimics the movement of particles
*Can explain:
**The three states of matter
**Gas pressure
**Density
**Thermal expansion and contraction
*Heat makes particles move more vigorously

==[[../Three states of matter|Three states of matter]]==
*Solid
**Particles cannot move freely
**Particles only vibrate in fixed positions
**Particles take on a fixed shape
*Liquid
**Particles do not take on a fixed shape; their shape depends on that of their container
**Particles have a fixed volume
**Particles can slide over one another
**Particles do not move as freely as those in gas
*Gas
**Particles move freely in all directions
**The shape and volume depend on that of the container

==[[../Gas pressure|Gas pressure]]==
*Refers to the pressure exerted on a surface by gas
*Measured
**in Pascals, or 'Pa'
**With a Bourdon gauge or pressure sensor
*Appears in air, in which case it's called air or atmospheric pressure
*Vacuum
**Absence of air
**Magdeburg hemispheres
***Two hollow hemispheres form an empty sphere
***The hemispheres cannot be separated
***The air pressure on the outside greatly exceeds that of the inside

==[[../Float or sink?|Density]]==
*&lt;math&gt;\text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}}&lt;/math&gt;
*If an object is submerged in a liquid or gas, it:
**Floats if its density is less than that of the liquid or gas
**Sinks if its density is more than that of the liquid or gas
*Density of water = 1
*Hot-air balloons
**There is an engine in the balloon
**As the engine is heated, the particles inside the balloon move more and are therefore further apart
**As density of the air inside the balloon deceases, it floats.
*Ships
**The overall density of ships are under that of the water because there is a lot of air inside
*Submarines
**Whether it is submerged or surfaced depends on the ballast tank
**When the ballast tank is filled with seawater, it sinks
**When the water is pumped out, it surfaces

==[[../Expand or contract?|Thermal expansion and contraction]]==
*Particles move more vigorously when heated, and are further apart as a result
*This makes the object larger, or expands
*When they are cooled, the particles move less vigorously and are closer together
*The object is made smaller, or contracts
*Bimetallic strips
**Made of two metal strips composed of different metals
**The metals do not expand to the same extent
**The strip bends when heated as a result
**Used in
***Thermostats
****The connection is cut off when an appliance is too hot
****The bimetallic strip in the appliance expands and therefore no longer completes the circuit
***Fire alarm
****The circuit is closed when the fire alarm is too hot
****This makes the alarm ring because the built-in bimetallic strip completes the circuit

      <text xml:space="preserve">In every language, profiling is the first crucial step of performance optimization. Otherwise, it is difficult to understand correctly what is the cause of bad performance, even for many experienced programmers. In addition, in Haskell, space leaks are a frequent source of problems with laziness. This means that learning to use profiling is important.

Currently, we just link to external references on the subject.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Trans-Neptunian objects, as their name suggests, are objects in the solar system that are farther from the Sun than the outermost planet, Neptune.  The most famous of these, and the first discovered, is Pluto.  Any trans-Neptunian dwarf planet is called a plutoid.  Pluto is in the Kuiper belt of objects that begins immediately beyond the orbit of Neptune.  Overlapping and beyond the Kuiper belt is the scattered disc, and far beyond the Kuiper belt is the Oort cloud. The Kuiper Belt is the source of short-period comets, and the Oort Cloud is the source of long-period comets.

== Intro ==
I'm Renyu. I'm a senior at University of Arizona. I'm majoring in Econ and I have a minor in Sports Management. 

I just started my [[Wikibooks]] on August 25th, 2010. This page is required by my &quot;Information economics and the [[Internet]]&quot; class and the textbook for this class is [[Strategy for Information Markets]]. My plan is to graduate in May, 2011.

== Interests ==
I'm a big fan of soccer. My favorite team is AC Milan.
Also, I'm a die-hard Arizona Wildcats fan.

== Sandbox ==
I have a [[User:Renyuc/Sandbox|sandbox]] for test edits.</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Occult Breast Primary'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Guidelines==
*NCCN Guideline (v2.2010)
**Mammogram and axillary ultrasound
**Chest/abdomen/pelvic CT
**Breast MRI:
***If MRI+, then follow stage-appropriate pathway
***If MRI-, T0N1
****Mastectomy + ANLD
****ALND + WBRT +/- nodal irradiation
****Chemotherapy as per N1 guidelines
***If MRI-, T0N2-3, then neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by mastectomy + ALND as per locally advanced guideline (presumably including PMRT)


==Overview==
*Rare presentation (&lt;1%)
*Breast MRI may be positive in as many as 60-70% of mammogram/ultrasound negative patients
**There is limited information on outcomes of patients who are MRI-
*Omiting local therapy (mastectomy or RT) results in poor outcomes, with local failure &gt;70% and significantly worse OS
*Local therapy with mastectomy or ALND + RT appears equivalent
*5-year LRR ranges between 10% and 58% in retrospective studies

==Breast MRI==
*'''Orbis Medical Centre, The Netherlands; 2010''' PMID 19822403 -- &quot;Breast MRI in clinically and mammographically occult breast cancer presenting with an axillary metastasis: a systematic review.&quot; (de Bresser J, Eur J Surg Oncol. 2010 Feb;36(2):114-9. Epub 2009 Oct 12.)
**Systematic review. 8 retrospective studies. 
**Outcome: Breast MRI can detect otherwise occult cancer in &gt;2/3 patients; high sensitivity but low specificity. In 80% of such patients, lesions can again be found with U/S for biopsy
**Conclusion: Breast MRI can result in additional detection of otherwise occult lesions. Because of low specificity, lesions should be histologically confirmed


==Breast Conservation Therapy==
*'''SEER/MD Anderson; 2010''' (1983-2006) PMID 20564117 -- &quot;Population-based analysis of occult primary breast cancer with axillary lymph node metastasis.&quot; (Walker GV, Cancer. 2010 Jun 8. [Epub ahead of print])
**SEER analysis, 750 patients with T0 N+ M0 disease (incidence 0.1%). ALND 80%, mastectomy 37%, RT 45%, neither mastectomy/RT 29%. Observation only 12%. Majority of patients pre-MRI era. Median F/U 4 years
**Outcome: 4-year OS 73%, CSS 83%. 10-year OS if BCT/Mastectomy 65% vs ALND only 58% vs observation 47% (SS). If ALND, no difference in 10-year OS between mastectomy 63% and BCT 76% (NS). MVA predictors for poor CSS: ER-, &amp;ge; 10 LN+, &lt;10 LN resected. Over time, increasing use of BCT and decreasing use of mastectomy.
**Conclusion: Need locoregional therapy; BCT with ALND and RT appears to provide equivalent outcomes to mastectomy</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Makemake, formally designated (136472) Makemake, was discovered in Mar 31 2005 by M.E. Brown, C.A. Trujillo, and D.Rabinowitz at [[w:Palomar Observatory|Palomar Observatory]]. It is the third largest known dwarf planet (after Eris and Pluto) and is the second largest known object in the Kuiper belt (after Pluto). 

{{NOTE|Makemake is the mythological creator deity of [[w:Easter Island|Easter Island]] and god of fertility in the mythos of the [[w:Rapanui|Rapanui]], the island's native people. The name was chosen in part to preserve the object's connection with the fact as it was discovered a few days past Easter. As having a Polynesian origin, the name is pronounced MAH-kay MAH-kay.}}

==Orbit==
Makemake averages 45.79 AU from the Sun, with an orbital eccentricity of 0.16.  Its orbit is tilted 28.96° from that of Earth.  Makemake takes 309.88 Earth-years to orbit the Sun.

==Rotation==
Makemake rotates about its axis once every 7.77 hours.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sedna is a planetoid that is currently classified as being in the scattered disc of objects that overlaps and extends beyond the Kuiper belt, although some astronomers believe it may actually be part of the Oort cloud.  It is not yet known whether Sedna has been made spherical by its own gravity; if this is eventually determined to be the case, it will be classified as a dwarf planet.

==Orbit==
Sedna has a highly elongated orbit, with an orbital eccentricity of 0.85.  Its distance from the Sun ranges from 76.36 AU at perihelion to 960.78 AU at aphelion, with an average of 518.57 AU. Its orbit is tilted 11.93° relative to Earth's.  It takes Sedna 11,809 Earth-years to revolve once around the Sun.

==Rotation==
Sedna's rotational period is the subject of substantial uncertainty, but may be about 10 hours.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Haumea (pronounced how-MAY-uh) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, making it a plutoid.  It is one-third as massive as Pluto.  It is very probably shaped as an ellipsoid despite having collapsed under its own gravity into an equilibrium shape (a requirement for a dwarf planet); the non-spherical shape is due to the unknown but extremely rapid rate of rotation.  An estimate of its dimensions is 1960 × 1518 × 996 kilometers.

==Orbit==

Haumea orbits the Sun with an average distance of 43.13 AU and an orbital eccentricity of 0.20.  Its plane of revolution is inclined by 28.22° to that of Earth.  Haumea's orbital period is 283.28 years.

A '''Zeppelin bend''' is an all purpose [[Knots/Bend knots|bend knot]]: it is a secure, easily tied, and jam-proof way to connect two ropes. Though its simplicity and security may be matched by other bends, it is unique in the ease with which it is untied, even after heavy loading.  It is also referred to as a &quot;Rosendahl bend&quot;, both names stemming from its use to moor airships (''[[wikt:Zeppelin|Zeppelin]]'' being a type of airship, and [[w:Charles Rosendahl|Charles Rosendahl]] being the airship captain who popularized this bend by insisting it be used to moor his craft).  Despite being praised by some sources as &quot;the perfect bend knot&quot;, the knot is not very well-known; [[w:Clifford Ashley|Clifford Ashley]], author of ''[[w:The Ashley Book of Knots|The Ashley Book of Knots]]'', was apparently unaware of this bend.

==Tying==

* Overlay one loop on the other, such that the working end of each rope faces &quot;outwards&quot; or away from the other hitch
* Pull either loose end once around the loop in the other rope, and then through the &quot;tunnel&quot; created by the two hitches
* Repeat with the other loose end
* Pull on all four rope parts to tighten the knot.
* To untie, pull simultaneously on the two turns that go round the standing parts.

When [[transplanting]] [[tree]]s or [[shrub]]s from one location to another, digging the plant in preparation for moving it is typically the most challenging part of the job.

Anyone who grows trees and shrubs is likely at times to wish to move them. Transplanting involves digging the tree or shrub, moving it to its new location, and then replanting it.  The most difficult of these steps, and the one which requires the most know-how, is digging.  This article discusses digging up trees and shrubs to about 10&amp;nbsp;cm (4”) in trunk diameter.

For small plants – up to a trunk diameter of 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm (1”) or so – digging can be done with an ordinary garden [[spade]].  It is important to do it right, but the work is not difficult and the odds of success are very good.  For trees or shrubs with a trunk diameter over 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm (1”) in diameter, and up to as much as about 10&amp;nbsp;cm (4”) in diameter, there are good options available which make it possible for even the home gardener to transplant successfully.  Note, however, that size and weight of the required root ball, and the work involved in transplanting, increases rapidly as the trunk diameter increases.  Moving trees with trunks over about 10&amp;nbsp;cm (4”) in diameter is likely to require heavy equipment and specialized expertise.  The cost of transplanting increases rapidly as the size of the tree increases, although there is almost no limit to the size of trees which can be transplanted successfully if one is willing to pay the price.

== Steps in digging ==

Digging a tree or shrub in preparation for transplanting involves several steps.  Various digging techniques can be employed, but no matter what approach is used, these steps must be attended to.  The information covered here includes just the bare essentials.  There are many factors which should be taken into account if one is to realize the best possible results.  These considerations include the species of plant being moved and its condition, the soil conditions, climate, season of the year, and accessibility of the site.  

# Selecting the tree or shrub to transplant, and determining the size of the root ball to be dug.  An approximate rule of thumb is to use a root ball 20 times the diameter of the trunk (as measured just above the basal flare) for trunks up to 1.3&amp;nbsp;cm (½”) in diameter, 18 times the diameter of the trunk for 1.3-2.5cm (½-1”) diameter trunks, 16 times the trunk diameter for trunks 2.5-3.8&amp;nbsp;cm (1-1½”) in diameter, 14 times the trunk diameter for trunks 3.8-6.4cm (1½-2½”) in diameter, and 12 times the trunk diameter for trunks 6.4 to 10&amp;nbsp;cm (2½” to 4”) in diameter.  For most trees and shrubs, the root ball depth should be about 20&amp;nbsp;cm (8”) for a 30&amp;nbsp;cm (12”) diameter root ball, ranging up to about 45&amp;nbsp;cm (18”) for a 120&amp;nbsp;cm (48”) diameter root ball.
# Cutting the root ball free from the surrounding soil so that it can be moved.  This can be done in various ways.  For small root balls (up to about 30–35&amp;nbsp;cm (12-14”) in diameter), an ordinary spade may be used to carefully slice the root ball free from the surrounding soil.  The best spade for this purpose should be sturdily constructed, with a long, narrow blade cut square across at the tip.  Such spades are sold commercially as “nursery spades”.  Also available are the less sturdy  “drain spades” - these have long, narrow blades which are usually rounded at the tip.  Whatever type of spade is used, it is helpful to keep the cutting edge quite sharp.  Keeping the blade clean and smooth helps also.  Coating the blade with silicone lubricant or a similar product can help.Use the spade to dig a circle around the tree at a slight 15 deg. slanting inward angle. After you complete the circle, cut away some of the soil outside the circle and angle the spade into the bottom center of the rootball to cut any tap root at the bottom of the ball. If it's small ball tie a string (twine or a small strap around the top outside edge of the ball to keep the soil of the ball compact and tight. Use the spade to lever the tree out of the hole. If it's a larger ball over 16&quot; you will need a tractor boom, a forklift or a lifting tripod in order to lift the tree out of the hole using either straps pulled under the ball or forks underneath the ball. A 32&quot; ball will weigh 300-500&amp;nbsp;lbs. depending on density of soil and moisture content. Years ago before the 1950s all trees were dug by hand. Years ago in order to move larger trees, the nursery men barerooted the tree while it was dormant to lessen the weight they had to move. Starting in the 1950s with Vermeer in the US and Optimal in Europe, modern hydraulic truck and loader mounted spades began to be used on a larger scale. Currently modern nurseries use machine tree spades to dig more than 90% of the trees grown today as they dig a uniform ball in lesss than a minute and automatically lift it out of the ground and place it into a burlap &quot;sock&quot; or &quot;pocket&quot; that holds the dirt inside of a metal wire basket that is tied and twisted into a tight package ready for shipping.
This stabilizes the root ball to help ensure that it stays intact during the transplanting process and is usually done B&amp;B style (ball and burlap) or in a &quot;WB&quot; wire basket.
# Lifting the root ball out of the ground so that it may be transported to its new location may take either a strong back, a ball buggy or dolly or a machine like a loader or a forklift.

Depending on the digging method used, steps 3 and 4 may be reversed.

A fast handdigger can dig 20-20 16&quot; root balls an hour or better. A machine spade can do 30-45 an hour. The bigger the ball the more time it takes to handle the tree properly. 

There are several related new tree moving/growing techniques worth mentioning:

Dr. Bonnie Appleton Phd has been experimenting at Virginia Tech's Hampton Roads Virginia Research Station with a method that   water washes the soil from the roots thus barerooting trees at any time of the year in order to examine and prune the roots for defects, (a major problem caused by the improper planting of young trees) then she washes the soil back around the roots with water to create a mud backfill whick locks the tree into the ground and eliminates air pockets in the soil. This also supplies the tree with a large influx of moisture to quickly grow new feeder roots.

Ren Heard of Lake Tree Farms in Virginia and Kentucky, uses a similar pressure washing technique combined with growing the recently dug tree in custom made baskets made of wood snow or sand fencing with more closely spaced pickets (organic pots) that air root prune the tree, eliminating circling roots (a major problem of pot growing) and allowing the tree to be replanted at anytime of the year with no transplant shock. This method is called Organic potting.

== Considerations ==

When transplanting any plant, preserving a significant fraction of the root system is necessary to maximize the chances of successfully re-establishing the plant in its new location. The practice of [[root pruning]] in preparation for transplanting can help concentrate the root system into a more confined area, thereby increasing the fraction of the root system that can be preserved.

In the case of trees and shrubs, the weight of a large root ball, and secondarily the weight of the tree itself, contribute significantly to the effort required to dig and move the plant.

== Digging equipment ==

Trees and shrubs of all sizes may be dug up using simple [[shovel]]s.

Conventional [[Engineering vehicle|earth moving equipment]] such as [[backhoe]]s and [[Loader (equipment)|front loaders]] are also used.

Some nurseries use ''tree spades'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Ian McKiel, Erin McManus and Mary McDonald, students, University of Minnesota Department of Horticultural Sciences | year = 2006 | url = http://www.sustland.umn.edu/implement/treespade.htm | title = Moving and Transplanting Trees with a Tree Spade | accessdate = 2006-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which are specialized powered equipment dedicated to digging up trees and shrubs.

A specialized tool for cutting roots may also be used, possibly in conjunction with a [[leverage]]-based manual system for lifting the root ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://tripplebrookfarm.com/tds/introTDS.html | title = Tripple Brook Farm Tree Digging System| accessdate = 2006-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of extremely large trees, these have at times been moved by equipment designed for moving missiles.

      <comment>/* Discrete Uniform Distribution */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">===Discrete Uniform Distribution===
The discrete uniform distribution (not to be confused with the [[Statistics/Distributions/Uniform|continuous uniform distribution]]) is where the probability of equally spaced possible values is equal. Mathematically this means that the probability density function is identical for a finite set of evenly spaced points. An example of would be rolling a fair 6-sided die. In this case there are six, equally like probabilities.

One common normalization is to restrict the possible values to be integers and the spacing between possibilities to be 1. In this setup, the only two parameters of the function are the minimum value (''a''), the maximum value (''b''). (Some even normalize it more, setting ''a=1''.) Let ''n=b-a+1'' be the number of possibilities. The probability density function is then

&lt;math&gt;
f\colon\{a,a+1,\ldots,b-1,b\}\to\R
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
f\left(x\right)=\frac{1}{n}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Mean====

Let &lt;math&gt;S=\{a,a+1,\ldots,b-1,b\}&lt;/math&gt;. The mean (notated as &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X]&lt;/math&gt;) can then be derived as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \sum_{x\in S} x f(x)=\sum^{n-1}_{i=0}\left(\frac{1}{n}(a+i)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X]= {1 \over n}\left( \sum^{n-1}_{i=0} a + \sum^{n-1}_{i=0} i\right)&lt;/math&gt;
Remember that in &lt;math&gt;\sum^{m}_{i=0}i = (m^2 + m)/2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X]= {1 \over n}\left( na + {(n-1)^2+(n-1) \over 2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X]= {2na + n^2-2n+1+n-1 \over 2n}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X]= {2a + n-1 \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X]= {a + b \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;

====Variance====

The variance (&lt;math&gt;E[(X-EX)^2]&lt;/math&gt;) can be derived:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = \operatorname{E}[(X-\operatorname{E}[X])^2] = \sum_{x\in S}f(x)(x-E[X])^2 = \sum^{n-1}_{i=0}\left(\frac{1}{n}\left((a+i)-{a + b \over 2}\right)^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = {1 \over n} \sum^{n-1}_{i=0} \left({a+ 2i - b \over 2}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = {1 \over 4n} \sum^{n-1}_{i=0} (a^2+ 4ai-2ab+4i^2-4ib + b^2)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = {1 \over 4n} \left[\sum^{n-1}_{i=0} (a^2-2ab + b^2)+ \sum^{n-1}_{i=0} (4ai-4ib)+\sum^{n-1}_{i=0}4i^2\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = {1 \over 4n} \left[n(a^2-ab + b^2)+ 4(a-b)\sum^{n-1}_{i=0} i+4\sum^{n-1}_{i=0}i^2\right]&lt;/math&gt;
Remember that in &lt;math&gt;\sum^{m}_{i=0}i^2 = m(m+1)(2m+1)/6&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = {1 \over 4n} \left[n(b-a)^2+ 4(a-b)[(n-1)n/2]+4[(n-1)n(2n-1)/6]\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = {1 \over 4n} \left[n(n-1)^2- 2(n-1)(n-1)n+2(n-1)n(2n-1)/3\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = {1 \over 4} \left[-(n-1)^2+2(n-1)(2n-1)/3\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = {1 \over 12} \left[-3(n-1)^2+2(n-1)(2n-1)\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = {1 \over 12} \left[-3(n^2-2n+1)+2(2n^2-3n+1)\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = {n^2-1 \over 12}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Gender in Loglan ===

In many natural languages when referring to a person you also have to refer to the person's gender. For example, in English, if you refer to a man you use &quot;he&quot; and for a woman you use &quot;she&quot;. The words &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot; automatically tells you the person's gender. Loglan, however, does not specify gender like in English. Instead, Loglan maintains gender neutrality.

=== First Letter ===

Loglan has a number of ways to refer to a person. One way involves using the first letter of the person's name.

==== Examples ====

* John helps people. He works as a doctor. -  la djan helba lo pernu. i la ''D'' kicmu

* Mary has arrived. She's in the red car over there. - la Maris godzi le hijra. i la ''M'' nenri le redro tcaro va ti

=== He, She, it ===

Loglan has no specifi words for &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot; or &quot;it&quot;. Instead it has variables ''da'', ''de'', ''di'', ''do'', and ''du'', which takes the place of the person or item in the order they appear in a conversation or sentence. So, you can use ''da'' to refer to the first person or item mentioned and  ''de'' for the second person or item as you would use &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot; or &quot;&quot;it&quot;. 

==== Examples ====

* John helps people. He works as a doctor. -  la djan helba lo pernu. i ''da'' kicmu

* Mary has arrived. She's in the red car over there. - la Maris godzi le hijra. i ''de'' nenri le redro tcaro va ti

      <text xml:space="preserve">this could be improved a bit (I am not hundred procent sure, so I am not going to do it). f' is not excact: derivate respect to what? I would say x, but there is also y (and also both can be functions of e.g. time). EDIT: I read it again, there is a notation difference: f is a function of x AND in other part function of x and y? what does this mean?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bears''' are large animals that like to eat honey and scratch with their claws on trees.

Bears come in lots of colors, including: black, brown and cinnamon. Only black bears are currently found in the western part of the United States. Black bears vary greatly in size and weight. Adult bears vary in weight from 125 to 450 pounds or more and male bears are usually larger than females of the same age. When on all four legs, black bears measure about three feet high at the shoulders and when upright on their hind legs, they may approach five to six feet tall. Black bears are known to live up to 20 years of age in the wild. They are very agile, are good swimmers, climb trees very well, and can run at speeds of up to 35 mph.
 
;When humans and bears meet...

Most conflict between humans and black bears arise as the result of human supplied foods. Things that attract bears are human food, human garbage, and pets. Some ways to keep a bear from attacking are: Keep your camp clean, never leave human food, garbage or pet food around or unsecured, don't cook in your camp or in sleeping area, leave all scented things away from sleeping areas and from bears, remove all scented clothes or articles before going to sleep. 

;If you meet a bear you should...

Remain calm, don't run, slowly back away. Make lots of noise. Stand up straight, don't kneel or bend, wave everything possible. Don't try to corner the bear. Back away from cubs, never go near them, or stand between a bear and it's cub.

;Bear behavior

Bears are curious, intelligent and potentially dangerous animals, but undue fear of bears can endanger both bears and people. Many bears are killed each year by people who are afraid of them. Respecting bears and learning proper behavior in their territory will help so that if you encounter a bear, neither of you will suffer needlessly from the experience. Most bears tend to avoid people. In most cases, if you give a bear the opportunity to do the right thing, it will.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lynx are part of the cat family. They hunt deer moose and other herbivores. Lynxes are carnivorous and will attack anything. If hungry they will eat human food including humans in all other cases lynx will avoid contact with humans excerpt when threatened by them to hurt or take their young kits away from them. contact with uncontained or untamed lynx isn't highly recommended especially for younger people who don't have experience with wild cats or something as highly dangerous as the lynx.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__

The 2003 invasion of Iraq (March 20 – May 1, 2003), was the start of the conflict known as the Iraq War or Operation Iraqi Freedom in which a combined force of troops from the United States, alongside the United Kingdom, and smaller contingents from Australia and Poland invaded Iraq and toppled the regime of [[../Saddam Hussein/]] in 21 days of major combat operations. This phase (March–April 2003) consisted of a conventionally fought war which concluded with the fall of Baghdad that marked the beginning of the second phase, the Iraq War which would last until August 31, 2010, and was followed by Operation New Dawn. This was considered a continuation of the Gulf War of 1991, prior to which Saddam Hussein had invaded Kuwait, and after defeat by Coalition Forces had agreed to surrender and/or destroy several types of weapons, including SCUD missiles and weapons of mass destruction (WMD).

Since the Persian Gulf War 1991 the US and Britain had been keeping a tight rein on Saddam Hussein, waging an undeclared conflict against Iraq for twelve years. U.S. President Bill Clinton had maintained sanctions and ordered air strikes in the &quot;Iraqi no-fly zones&quot; Operation Desert Fox, in the hope that Saddam would be overthrown by political enemies inside Iraq and had signed into law H.R. 4655, the Iraq Liberation Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c105:H.R.4655.ENR: Iraq Liberation Act of 1998] The Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt; which appropriated funds to Iraqi opposition groups.Four countries participated with troops during the initial invasion phase, which lasted from March 20 to May 1, 2003. These were the United States (248,000), United Kingdom (45,000), Australia (2,000), and Poland (194). 36 other countries were involved in its aftermath.  In preparation for the invasion, 100,000 US troops were assembled in Kuwait by February 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/02/18/sprj.irq.deployment/index.html|title=U.S. has 100,000 troops in Kuwait | work=CNN | date=February 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States supplied the vast majority of the invading forces, but also received support from Kurdish irregulars in Iraqi Kurdistan.

According to U.S. President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, the reasons for the invasion were &quot;to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, to end Saddam Hussein's alleged support for terrorism, and to free the Iraqi people.&quot; According to Blair, the trigger was Iraq's failure to take a &quot;final opportunity&quot; to disarm itself of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons that US and British officials called an immediate and intolerable threat to world peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/01/20030131-23.html |title=President Bush Meets with Prime Minister Blair |publisher=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov |date=2003-01-31 |accessdate=2009-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some remnants of pre-1991 production were found after the end of the war, US government spokespeople confirmed that these were not the weapons for which the US went to war{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}. There also have been claims that the war was waged in order to take oil from Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ahJS35XsmXGg&amp;refer=top_world_news-redirectoldpage &quot;U.S., U.K. Waged War on Iraq Because of Oil, Blair Adviser Says&quot;] Bloomberg.com, May 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,200499,00.html &quot;Report: Hundreds of WMDs Found in Iraq&quot;], FOXNews.com, June 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/projects/pdf/Iraq_WMD_Declassified.pdf Fax and report], June 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the Central Intelligence Agency released a report saying that no weapons of mass destruction had been found in Iraq.&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7634313/ |title=CIA’s final report: No WMD found in Iraq - Conflict in Iraq - MSNBC.com |publisher=Msnbc.msn.com |date=April 25, 2005 |accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was increasingly strong pressure among American policy influencers, from the mid-1990s on, that regime change in Iraq was important to the overall goals of American foreign policy. In a January 2003 CBS poll 64% of US nationals had approved of military action against Iraq, however 63% wanted Bush to find a diplomatic solution rather than go to war, and 62% believed the threat of terrorism directed against the US would increase due to war.&lt;ref name = &quot;CBSnews-20030124&quot;&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/01/23/opinion/polls/main537739.shtml &quot;Poll: Talk First, Fight Later&quot;]. ''CBS.com'', Jan. 24, 2003. Retrieved on April 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion of Iraq was strongly opposed by some traditional US allies, including the governments of France, Germany, New Zealand, and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pastel.diplomatie.gouv.fr/editorial/actual/ael2/bulletin.gb.asp?liste=20030211.gb.html Joint Declaration by Russia, Germany and France on Iraq] France Diplomatie February 10, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/751538 NZ praised for 'steering clear of Iraq war] The Dominion Post December 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Julian |last=Beltrame |title= Canada to Stay out of Iraq War|publisher=Maclean's |date= March 31, 2003|accessdate=19 January 2009 |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=M1ARTM0012457 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their leaders argued that there was no evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and that invading the country was not justified in the context of UNMOVIC's February 12, 2003 report. On February 15, 2003, a month before the invasion, there were worldwide protests against the Iraq war, including a rally of three million people in Rome, which is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest ever anti-war rally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guinness&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invasion was preceded by an air strike on the Presidential Palace in Baghdad on March 19, 2003. The following day coalition forces launched an incursion into Basra Province from their massing point near the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. While commandos launched an amphibious assault from the Persian Gulf to secure Basra and the surrounding petroleum fields, the main invasion army moved into southern Iraq, occupying the region and engaging in the Battle of Nasiriyah on March 23. Massive air strikes across the country and against Iraqi command and control threw the defending army into chaos and prevented an effective resistance. 

On March 26 the 173rd Airborne Brigade was airdropped near the northern city of Kirkuk where they joined forces with Kurdish rebels and fought several actions against the Iraqi army to secure the northern part of the country.

The main body of coalition forces continued their drive into the heart of Iraq and met with little resistance. Most of the Iraqi military was quickly defeated and Baghdad was occupied on April 9. Other operations occurred against pockets of the Iraqi army including the capture and occupation of Kirkuk on April 10, and the attack and capture of Tikrit on April 15. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and the central leadership went into hiding as the coalition forces completed the occupation of the country. On May 1 an end of major combat operations was declared, ending the invasion period and beginning the military occupation period.

==Criticisms==
Opponents of military intervention in Iraq have attacked the decision to invade Iraq along a number of lines, including calling into question the evidence used to justify the war, arguing for continued diplomacy, challenging the war’s legality, suggesting that the U.S. had other more pressing security priorities, (that is, Afghanistan and North Korea) and predicting that the war would destabilize the Middle East region.
The breadth and depth of the criticism was particularly notable in comparison with the first Gulf War, which met with considerably less domestic and international opposition, although the geopolitical situation had evolved since the last decade.  Others criticize the war in Iraq, actually invoking the word &quot;terrorism&quot; in an attempt to parallel the perceived violences in the US (9/11) to what Iraqis experienced daily during 2003 and thereafter.  Particular to many criticisms is the perceived colonial impetus to erase certain histories while imposing others, perhaps best demonstrated by the US led coalition's destruction of every mural and statue of Saddam Hussein to the October 2003 installation of the new dinar, erasing the face of Saddam Hussein and putting on the new currency Abū ʿAlī al-Ḥasan ibn al-Ḥasan ibn al-Haytham, 10th century mathematician and scientist.&lt;ref&gt;Vigo, Julian. &quot;Discourses of Modernity &amp; the New: Performing Colonization from Morocco to Iraq&quot; in Rethinking Modernity.

While you're thinking about replacing text with {{tl|BookCat}}, it would also be useful to replace any instances of class=&quot;prettytable&quot; with class=&quot;wikitable&quot; so that we can phase it out here like Wikipedia has.  Also, while this is something that might need to be discussed in the reading room, all the uses of class=&quot;collapsible&quot; are using historical JavaScript that has the opposite behavior of collapsible tables at Wikipedia.  If they could be changed to use a different class name with old JavaScript adjusted to match and then new JavaScript imported from Wikipedia for the old class name with the behavior that those coming from Wikipedia expect, that might be something to look into if there are no objections. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 19:48, 11 November 2010 (UTC)

The '''Thief knot'''  resembles the [[Knots/Binding knots/Reef knot|reef knot]] except that the free, or working, ends are on opposite sides.  It is said that sailors would secure their belongings in a ditty bag using the thief knot, often with the ends hidden.  If another sailor went through the bag, the odds were high the thief would tie the bag back using the more common reef knot, revealing the tampering, hence the name.  It is difficult to tie by mistake, unlike the [[Knots/Binding knots/Granny knot|granny knot]]. The thief knot is much less secure than the already insecure reef knot. It unties itself if the lines are pulled when the same action would seize a reef knot.

Saddam Hussein Abd al-Majid al-Tikriti (Arabic: {{lang|ar|صدام حسين التكريتي}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Ṣaddām Ḥusayn ʿAbd al-Majīd al-Tikrītī}}''&lt;!--

&lt;ref name=&quot;ref1&quot;&gt;''Saddam'' is his personal name, and means ''the stubborn one'' or ''he who confronts'' in Arabic (in Iraq also a term for a car's bumper). ''Hussein'' (sometimes also transliterated as '''''Hussayn''''' or '''''Hussain''''') is not a surname in the Western sense but a [[patronymic]], his father's given personal name; ''Abid al-Majid'' his grandfather's; ''al-Tikriti'' means he was born and raised in (or near) Tikrit. He was commonly referred to as ''Saddam Hussein'', or ''Saddam'' for short. The observation that referring to the deposed Iraqi president as only ''Saddam'' is derogatory or inappropriate may be based on the assumption that Hussein is a family name: thus, the ''New York Times'' refers to him as &quot;Mr. Hussein&quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/02/international/middleeast/02IRAQ.html?8br], while Encyclopædia Britannica uses just ''Saddam'' [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?eu=42559]. A full discussion can be found [http://www.cbc.ca/news/indepth/words/saddam_hussein.html] (Blair Shewchuk, CBC News Online).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;; 28 April 1937&lt;ref name=&quot;ref2&quot;&gt;Under his government, this date was his official date of birth. His real date of birth was never recorded, but it is believed to be a date between 1935 and 1939. From Con Coughlin, ''Saddam The Secret Life'' Pan Books, 2003 (ISBN 0-330-39310-3).&lt;/ref&gt; – 30 December 2006)&lt;ref&gt;executed by hanging after being convicted of crimes against humanity following [[trial of Saddam Hussein|his trial and conviction]]&lt;/ref&gt; was the President of Iraq from 16 July 1979 until 9 April 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usgovinfo.about.com/library/weekly/aasaddambio.htm Official State Biography of Saddam Hussein&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/baghdad_04-09-03.html Online NewsHour Update: Coalition Says Iraqi Regime Has Lost Control of Baghdad - 9 April 2003&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A leading member of the revolutionary [[../Ba'ath Party/]], which espoused secular pan-Arabism, economic modernization, and Arab socialism, Saddam played a key role in the 1968 coup that brought the party to long-term power.

As vice president under the ailing General Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, and at a time when many groups were considered capable of overthrowing the government, Saddam created security forces through which he tightly controlled conflict between the government and the armed forces. In the early 1970s, Saddam spearheaded Iraq's nationalization of the Western-owned Iraq Petroleum Company, which had long held a monopoly on the country's oil. Through the 1970s, Saddam cemented his authority over the apparatuses of government as Iraq's economy grew at a rapid pace.&lt;ref&gt;See PBS Frontline (2003), &quot;The survival of Saddam: secrets of his life and leadership: interview with Saïd K. Aburish&quot; at [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/saddam/interviews/aburish2.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

As president, Saddam maintained power during the Iran–Iraq War of 1980 through 1988, and throughout the Persian Gulf War of 1991. During these conflicts, Saddam suppressed several movements, particularly Shi'a and Kurdish movements seeking to overthrow the government or gain independence, respectively. Whereas some Arabs venerated him for his aggressive stance against foreign intervention and for his support for the Palestinians,&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, 16 October 2000 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/974987.stm]&lt;/ref&gt; other Arabs and Western leaders vilified him as the force behind both a deadly attack on northern Iraq in 1988 and, two years later, an [[../Invasion of Kuwait/|invasion of Kuwait]] to the south.

By 2003, the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush perceived that Saddam remained sufficiently relevant and dangerous to be overthrown. In March of that year, [[../2003 Invasion/|the U.S. and its allies invaded Iraq]], eventually deposing Saddam. Captured by U.S. forces on 13 December 2003, Saddam was brought to trial under the Iraqi interim government set up by U.S.-led forces. On 5 November 2006, he was convicted of charges related to the 1982 killing of 148 Iraqi Shi'ites convicted of planning an assassination attempt against him, and was sentenced to death by hanging. Saddam was executed on 30 December 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCexecution&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6218485.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Saddam Hussein executed in Iraq |date=2006-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of his death, Saddam had become a prolific author.&lt;ref name=Theodolou&gt;Theodolou, Michael.

==Incarceration and trial==
===Capture and incarceration===
[[file:saddamcapture.jpg|right|120px|Saddam Hussein captured &amp; shaven]]

In April 2003, Saddam's whereabouts remained in question during the weeks following the fall of Baghdad and the conclusion of the major fighting of the war. Various sightings of Saddam were reported in the weeks following the war but none was authenticated. At various times Saddam released audio tapes promoting popular resistance to the U.S.-led occupation.

Saddam was placed at the top of the U.S. list of &quot;most-wanted Iraqis&quot;. In July 2003, his sons Uday and Qusay and 14-year-old grandson Mustapha were killed in a three-hour&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,,1004168,00.html |title = Dead: the sons of Saddam | accessdate = 2008-07-16 | work = The Guardian |date = 23 July 2003 |author = Julian Borger and Gary Younge | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; gunfight with U.S. forces.

On 14 December 2003, U.S. administrator in Iraq L. Paul Bremer announced that Saddam Hussein had been captured at a farmhouse in ad-Dawr near Tikrit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/12/14/sprj.irq.saddam.operation/ |title =  Saddam 'caught like a rat' in a hole |accessdate = 2008-07-16 | date=14 December 2003 | work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bremer presented video footage of Saddam in custody.

Saddam was shown with a full beard and hair longer than his familiar appearance. He was described by U.S. officials as being in good health. Bremer reported plans to put Saddam on trial, but claimed that the details of such a trial had not yet been determined. Iraqis and Americans who spoke with Saddam after his capture generally reported that he remained self-assured, describing himself as a &quot;firm but just leader.&quot;

According to U.S. military sources, following his capture by U.S. forces on 13 December Saddam was transported to a U.S. base near Tikrit, and later taken to the U.S. base near Baghdad. The day after his capture he was reportedly visited by longtime opponents such as Ahmed Chalabi.

British tabloid newspaper ''The Sun'' posted a picture of Saddam wearing white briefs on the front cover of a newspaper. Other photographs inside the paper show Saddam washing his trousers, shuffling, and sleeping. The United States Government stated that it considers the release of the pictures a violation of the Geneva Convention, and that it would investigate the photographs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4565505.stm Saddam underwear photo angers US] BBC May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/05/20/saddam.photos/|publisher=CNN|title=Pentagon vows to probe Saddam photos|date=2005-05-21|accessdate=2007-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During this period Hussein was interrogated by FBI agent George Piro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Pelley | first = Scott | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Interrogator Shares Saddam's Confessions | work = | publisher = CBS News | date = 2008-01-27 | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/01/24/60minutes/main3749494.shtml| doi = | accessdate = 2008-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The guards at the Baghdad detention facility called their prisoner &quot;Vic,&quot; and let him plant a little garden near his cell. The nickname and the garden are among the details about the former Iraqi leader that emerged during a 27 March 2008 tour of prison of the Baghdad cell where Saddam slept, bathed, and kept a journal in the final days before his execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/03/27/hussein.journal/index.html |title = Tour of prison reveals the last days of Saddam Hussein - CNN.com |accessdate = 2008-07-16 | date=27 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial===

[[Image:Saddam Hussein at trial, July 2004-edit1.JPEG|thumb|120px|left|Saddam speaking at a pre-trial hearing]]
On 30 June 2004, Saddam Hussein, held in custody by U.S. forces at the U.S. base &quot;Camp Cropper&quot;, along with 11 other senior Baathist leaders, were handed over legally (though not physically) to the interim Iraqi government to stand trial for crimes against humanity and other offences.

A few weeks later, he was charged by the Iraqi Special Tribunal with crimes committed against residents of Dujail in 1982, following a failed assassination attempt against him. Specific charges included the murder of 148 people, torture of women and children and the illegal arrest of 399 others.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRW1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| last =  | first =  | date = 19 November 2006 | title = Judging Dujail | work = Human Rights Watch | url = http://www.hrw.org/en/node/11112/section/1 | accessdate = 14 December 2009 }}&lt;br /&gt;393 members of the pro Iranian Dawa Party (a banned organisation) were arrested as suspects of which 148, including ten children, confessed to taking part in the plot. It is believed more than 40 suspects died during interrogation or while in detention. Those arrested who were found not guilty were either exiled if relatives of the convicted or released and returned to Dujail. Only 96 of the 148 condemned were actually executed, two of the condemned were accidentally released while a third was mistakenly transferred to another prison and survived. The 96 executed included four men mistakenly executed after having been found not guilty and ordered released. The ten children were originally believed to have been among the 96 executed, but they had in fact been imprisoned near the city of Samawah.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Saddam-Formally-Charged-23683.shtml | title=Saddam Formally Charged | publisher=Softpedia | author= | date=2006-05-15 | accessdate=2007-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the many challenges of the trial were:
*Saddam and his lawyers' contesting the court's authority and maintaining that he was still the President of Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,187923,00.html |title=Judge Closes Trial During Saddam Testimony |publisher=Fox News |date=2006-03-15 |accessdate=2006-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The assassinations and attempts on the lives of several of Saddam's lawyers.
*The replacement of the chief presiding judge, midway through the trial.

On 5 November 2006, Saddam Hussein was found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to death by hanging. Saddam's half brother, Barzan Ibrahim, and Awad Hamed al-Bandar, head of Iraq's Revolutionary Court in 1982, were convicted of similar charges. The verdict and sentencing were both appealed but subsequently affirmed by Iraq's Supreme Court of Appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/26/AR2006122600297_pf.html | title=Iraq court upholds Saddam death sentence | publisher=Reuters | date=2006-12-26 | accessdate=2008-11-12 | author=Mariam Karouny and Ibon Villelabeitia }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 December 2006, Saddam was hanged.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCexecution&quot;/&gt;

==Execution==

Saddam was hanged on the first day of Eid ul-Adha, 30 December 2006, despite his wish to be shot (which he felt would be more dignified).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://web.archive.org/web/20071011232542/http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30000-1228824,00.html | title = &quot;I Want a Firing Squad&quot;, Web | author = Sky News | date =  5 November 2006 | accessdate = 2007-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The execution was carried out at Camp Justice]], an Iraqi army base in  Kadhimiya, a neighborhood of northeast Baghdad.

The execution was videotaped on a mobile phone and his captors could be heard insulting Saddam. The video was leaked to electronic media and posted on the Internet within hours, becoming the subject of global controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://web.archive.org/web/20080205073754/http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/20070102/saddam-web-tv.htm | title = Saddam Execution Images Shown on TV, Web | author = Bauder, David | work = International Business Times |date=2007-01-02 | accessdate = 2006-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later claimed by the head guard at the tomb where his body remains that Saddam's body was stabbed six times after the execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/iraq/article5058550.ece| title = Saddam Hussein's body was stabbed in the back, says guard | author = Haynes, Deborah | work = The Times |date=2008-11-01 | accessdate = 2008-11-01 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long before the execution, Saddam's lawyers released his last letter. The following includes several excerpts:

{{quote|To the great nation, to the people of our country, and humanity,

Many of you have known the writer of this letter to be faithful, honest, caring for others, wise, of sound judgment, just, decisive, careful with the wealth of the people and the state ... and that his heart is big enough to embrace all without discrimination.

You have known your brother and leader very well and he never bowed to the despots and, in accordance with the wishes of those who loved him, remained a sword and a banner.

This is how you want your brother, son or leader to be ... and those who will lead you (in the future) should have the same qualifications.

Here, I offer my soul to God as a sacrifice, and if He wants, He will send it to heaven with the martyrs, or, He will postpone that ... so let us be patient and depend on Him against the unjust nations.

Remember that God has enabled you to become an example of love, forgiveness and brotherly coexistence ... I call on you not to hate because hate does not leave a space for a person to be fair and it makes you blind and closes all doors of thinking and keeps away one from balanced thinking and making the right choice.

I also call on you not to hate the peoples of the other countries that attacked us and differentiate between the decision-makers and peoples. Anyone who repents - whether in Iraq or abroad - you must forgive him.

You should know that among the aggressors, there are people who support your struggle against the invaders, and some of them volunteered for the legal defence of prisoners, including Saddam
Hussein ... some of these people wept profusely when they said goodbye to me.

Dear faithful people, I say goodbye to you, but I will be with the merciful God who helps those who take refuge in him and who will never disappoint any faithful, honest believer ... God is Great ... God is great ... Long live our nation ... Long live our great struggling people ... Long live Iraq, long live Iraq ... Long live Palestine ... Long live jihad and the mujahedeen.

Saddam Hussein
President and Commander in Chief of the Iraqi Mujahed Armed Forces

Additional clarification note:

I have written this letter because the lawyers told me that the so-called criminal court—established and named by the invaders—will allow the so-called defendants the chance for a last word. But that court and its chief judge did not give us the chance to say a word, and issued its verdict without explanation and read out the sentence—dictated by the invaders—without presenting the evidence. I wanted the people to know this.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hussein's last letter&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,20990518-5001021,00.html | title=Saddam's final words | publisher=The Daily Telegraph | date=2006-12-30 | accessdate=2008-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|Letter by Saddam Hussein}}

A second unofficial video, apparently showing Saddam's body on a trolley, emerged several days later. It sparked speculation that the execution was carried out incorrectly as Saddam Hussein had a gaping hole in his neck.&lt;ref name=&quot;newvideo&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/09/AR2007010900258.html | title = New Video of Saddam's Corpse on Internet | author = Qassum Abdul-Zahra | work = [[Associated Press]] |date= 2007-01-09 | accessdate = 2006-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saddam was buried at his birthplace of Al-Awja in Tikrit, Iraq, 3&amp;nbsp;km (2&amp;nbsp;mi) from his sons Uday and Qusay Hussein, on 31 December 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;burial&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11669236/ | title=Tribal chief: Saddam buried in native village | publisher=[[Reuters]] | date=2006-12-30 | accessdate=2006-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==No Yeast, some thoughts.==
Hello. I recently tried this recipe. They were very tasty, however did not taste much like traditional cinnamon rolls/buns. More like a randon cinnamon pastry. I think this is because normally there is yeast. I feel like maybe people tend to trust wiki Cookbook to be where to look to find the most standard recipe for what they are wanting. Maybe this is an issue? 

Regardless, a couple other things I noticed about the recipe I thought I would share, in case the author might want to make revisions, 15-20 minutes did not seem near long enough (and no I never opened the door to let heat escape until the 15 mins). I feel like there was one other thing but I forget now so I guess it wasn't that much an issue. [[User:Eddie mars|Eddie mars]] ([[User talk:Eddie mars|talk]]) 21:47, 26 August 2010 (UTC)

This recipe seems to be for American cinnamon swirls, and not Scandinavian cinnamon buns.
Cinnamon buns are indeed made with yeast, and not baking soda.  They're buns, not danish.  Cinnamon buns are also rarely covered with icing like American pastry frequently is, but often sprinkled with nib or pearl sugar (Sweden, &quot;kanelbulle&quot;) or castor sugar (Norway, &quot;skillingsbolle&quot;).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Korach – (Bald)  Numbers 16:1 – 18:32
I Samuel 11:14-12:22;  II Timothy 2:8-21; 3:1-4:5;  II John 1-13
    
Rebellions continue to plague Moshe. A great mutiny is instigated by its principal spokesman, Korach, who heads a group of malcontents and convinces them to rise up against Moshe and question his leadership.

“Korach the son of Yitzhar, the son of Kehat, the son of Levi,” incites a rebellion against Moshe. He is joined by Dathan and Aviram, and On, the son of Peleth, all of the tribe of Reuben.  Also participating are 250 “leaders of the community, those regularly summoned to assembly, men of renown.”  (Numbers 16: 1)

They challenged the authority of Moshe. In the words of the Jerusalem Talmud, Korach declared, “The Torah was not given by God, Moshe is not a prophet, and Aahron is not the high priest.” (j.Sanhedrin 50a)   

Korach and his rebels had begun to question the legitimacy of Moshe’ prophetic office.  Moshe claimed He heard directly from Yahweh, but who was to say that it was so? How were they to know he was really sent from God?  


&lt;u&gt;The Background of the Rebellion&lt;/u&gt;

Korach... the son of Yitzhar, the son of Kehat, the son of Levi (16:1) was motivated by a sense of injustice, pride and jealousy. Korach’s chief complaint against Moshe was that of nepotism.  He believed Moshe hand picked his brother for the job of High priest.  Korach was the son of Izhar, the brother of Amram, who was the father of Moshe and Aaron, which makes Korach a cousin to Moshe and Aaron.

Cousin Korach along with Dathan and Abiram who were placed next to them in the camp arrangements, in addition to 250 other princes of the assembly of Yisrael, charged Moshe and Aaron with usurping privileges and offices which rightly belonged to others.  Influenced by jealousy, because of the high honors and privileges of the priesthood, Korach and those who were Levites among him complained that they are confined to an inferior service in the tabernacle.  

It is very clear from this passage that Korach did not wish to serve the people but to lead them.  Those who desire to lead must desire to serve and the driving desire is what shows us the heart of those who believe they should be leading.  On the surface it might seem like he was questioning if God really chose Moshe and Aahron to lead the people because all of Israel were holy before God. As was the problem with the scribes and Pharisees that Yeshua dealt with, was with the heart intent that was wrong.  Moshe never wanted to lead Israel. In fact he tried to persuade Yahweh that He had made a mistake in choosing him, but that was probably why God wanted Moshe because he did not want to be a leader, he had a servant-heart.

Their accusation was, “It is too much for you!” in Hebrew, “rav lachem”. “You have taken positions that are much too high.” “You are setting yourselves up over the congregation.” “You are going against the principles of democracy.” They thought that Moshe had given special privileges to his family members and those closest to him.

Anyone can perform a service, but it is the one whose life is submitted before the altar in the presence of Yahweh who is the anointed one chosen to speak on His behalf. In presumption, would-be ‘leaders’ such as Korach set aside the fact that Yahweh chooses His anointed leaders.  He chose Moshe to be the vessel through whom He spoke on Mt. Sinai in the thick cloud so that all could hear.   (Exodus 19:9)  Yet although his chosen-ness was obvious, these men - leaders themselves (16: 2), contest Moshe’ position.

He was moved to it by the fact that Elitzafan, the son of his father’s brother, was appointed prince over his family; as it says (Numbers 3:30), “And the prince of the fathers house of the families of the Kehatites was Elitzafan the son of Uzziel.” Korach argued: My father was one of four brothers; as it says (Exodus 4:18), “And the sons of Kehat: Amram, and Yitzhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel.” As for Amram the firstborn, his son Aahron attained to greatness and Moshe to royalty. Who then should rightly take the next office? Is it not the next in line? Yet Moshe appointed the son of Uzziel!  

Korach’s rebellion erupts against the background of them being told that their generation will not enter the Land of Israel. Korach’s co-conspirators, Dathan and Aviram, play on the people’s sense of despair. 
They were placed next to Korach and his company on the south side of the camp.  (Numbers 3:29) They therefore had opportunity to talk together with him and to murmur against the leadership and conspire together in their rebellion.
 
According to the “Legends of the Jews” by Louis Ginzberg (1873-1953), which is a comprehensive compilation of background details to Biblical stories, Korach approached Moshe with the intent of ridiculing his decrees and validating a claim that he was not chosen to the leadership.   He did this by challenging the recent instructions which Moshe had given of making fringes on the garments and regarding the mezuzah (scriptures placed on the doorposts), with questions directed to make it appear that they were man-made and inconsistent with something that Yahweh would expect of the people.  According to Korach, Moses and Aaron the priest invented all the commandments in order to make the lives of the people hard and to exploit them by taking the many gifts that are due to the priests and the Levites. 

This incitement of everyone getting their own direction and making their own choices of how to implement the divine instructions is the essence of rebellion.   Yahweh had chosen Moshe as the vessel through whom to give His explicit instructions for all the issues of life for His people.  To change those things is to rebel against God Himself, which was how Moshe interpreted it. Moshe therefore did not attempt to answer the challenge, but referred it to back to Yahweh Himself to answer the challenge

Yeshua said, “The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.” (John 10:11)
The rebellion of Korach led an uprising which constituted a complete split in the assembly, and so it had to be dealt with in a decisive manner.   The evil tongue, (lashon harah),  releases destructive forces and an angel of destruction is given legal right to act when we complain. Let us keep from complaining, so that the Destroyer will not harm us!


&lt;u&gt;God-Ordained Leadership&lt;/u&gt;

There is, a tendency of the masses to follow articulate charismatic-type leaders who play to the crowd.  Korach was just such a type leader. But it should be noted here that Korach was a type of Cain or Balaam and it is an admonition to prevent presumptuous and self-seeking teachers.  The name Korach means bald and suggests a lack of a normal or usual covering of the Holy Spirit.  Korach gathers followers unto Himself not for the greater good of His people of Yisrael, but for himself.  His desire, influenced by jealousy, was to become chieftain.   Numbers 16:3   However, his pride led him to lose everything.

Pride and ambition can easily give way to slander and rebellion.  Korach starts by accusing Moshe and demanding equal rights with him.   He took his spirit of discontent, separated himself with others who had a similar grudge against authority and started an uprising.  It showed that he had no fear of Yahweh, the Author of divine instruction and law who had instituted His divine order.   Moshe said it was a direct rebellion against Yahweh Himself.   “For which cause both you and all your company are gathered together against Yahweh... “ (Numbers 16:11  See Stone Chumash, notes on v. 11, p. 823)

Yeshua said in Matthew 5:3, “Blessed are the poor in spirit [contrite]: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven,” and in Matthew 20:27, “And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant.” How easy it is to become displeased with those who Yahweh has chosen to be leaders and to fall into the sin (spirit) of Korach. Yahweh curses those who use their mouths to try to destroy godly leadership.  Read Jude 1-25 (especially verses 10-13).
Notice a progression (or downward spiral) of actions on the part of Korach and his rebels (16:1-3 ): they separated themselves from fellowship, rose up against Moshe, gathered together others of like mind and falsely accused leadership of wrong doings. This is the world’s formula for political (humanistic) power and advancement and is the opposite of how to advance in Yahweh’s kingdom where the way down is the way up (the way of laying one’s life down in service (Matt. 20:27; 23:10).  Rebels tend to separate themselves from fellowship, seek out other like-minded rebels and then rise up in defiance and accusation against godly leadership. Again, this leads to political power. The way of spiritual power is laid out in Acts 2:42-47 where the followers of Yeshua continued steadfastly in the apostles’ doctrine, in fellowship, breaking bread together, in prayer and sharing their goods with one another. The result was spiritual power and anointing. This can only happen as people forsake not the assembling of themselves together (Heb. 10:25) and function within the Body of Yeshua submitted one to another.


&lt;u&gt;Fire and Earth&lt;/u&gt;

When it becomes clear that Korach and the 250 “men of renown” are aspiring for the Kehunah (priesthood) themselves, Moshe challenges them to offer ketoret (incense) to God--the most sacred of the Divine services in the Sanctuary, permitted only to a priest, and only under special circumstances.  Aahron, whose appointment as Kohen Gadol (High Priest) they are contesting, will also offer the ketoret. “and God will show who is His, and who is holy... and whom He has chosen will He bring near to Him.”

Korach and the 250 men accept the challenge.   Moshe, in great temperance in the situation, gives them time to consider what they are doing, but, overtaken in their deception they come to the challenge the next morning. “And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense on them, and stood in the door of the Tent of Meeting with Moshe and Aahron.” The people having wrongfully listened to their contentions, are stirred in fleshly sympathy to Korach’s rebellion, and gather en masse at the entrance to the Sanctuary.  Rabbi Hertz makes the point that Moshe defence of Aahron caused some to turn back from Korach, as 
seen by his descendants in 1 Chronicles 6:22 who lead in singing in the assembly.  Some Psalms also are by the ‘Sons of Korach’

Yahweh’s anger is aroused. He says to Moshe and Aahron: “Separate yourselves from among this congregation, and I will consume them in a moment!”  They fell upon their faces and pleaded that the entire assembly would not suffer for the sin of one man.
 
Dathan and Aviram had already refused Moshe’ summons; now Moshe goes to them, in an effort to quell the mutiny.  But they remain defiant.   The moment of truth arrives - “Hereby you shall know that God has sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of my own mind.  If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then God has not sent me. But if God creates a new creation, and the earth opens her mouth, and swallows them up, with all that appertain to them, and they go down alive into abyss; then you shall understand that these men have provoked God.” 

And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground split beneath them and all the assembly that were round about them fled at their cry for fear that the earth swallow them up also.  
The Targum Johnathan says that they screamed from the deep “Righteous is Yahweh, and His judgment is truth, and the words of His servant Moshe are truth; but we are wicked who have rebelled against him:”  As for the contenders for the priesthood, “there came out a fire from God, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered the ketoret.”   (16:28-33)


&lt;u&gt;The Continuing Rebellion&lt;/u&gt;

One would think that upon witnessing all this powerful phenomena that they would have repented and have walked closely with Yahweh after that.   But instead they continue on in their rebellion and bring defiant charges against Yahweh Himself for having judged them. How deeply the rebellion of one man had stirred the flesh of the whole assembly.

The next day, the people again massed upon Moshe and Aahron. “You have caused the deaths of the people of God!” they accuse them.  They had not learned from the example the day before and rebellion is still in their hearts because they still were blaming Moshe and not acknowledging Yahweh’s sovereignty over them.  With all the miraculous signs, they were still reacting in the flesh, so again He has to judge those in rebellion against Him, for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft.   1 Samuel 15:23

Yahweh ‘s anger is again aroused, and a plague breaks out among the people. “Take a censer,” cries Moshe to Aahron, “and put fire in it from off the altar, and put on ketoret/incense, and take it quickly to the congregation, and make atonement for them; for wrath is gone out from Yahweh...”   And Aahron took as Moshe commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague had begun among the people...   And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed but not before 14, 700 of the community have been slain.   In their rebellion they had rejected Yahweh just as Korach had done.

The censers which had been used by Korach and his associate rebels were made into a brass plate attached to the altar as a memorial to the assembly of their sin.  It was forever a reminder of the judgement exercised against ministering in fleshly motivation and zeal for personal glory.   We are to in honour prefer one another, and to minister according to divine calling. If we are motivated by the flesh as were Korach, Abiram and Dathan, then we shall be also as “sounding brass and tinkling cymbals”  soundings of the flesh of unholy priests in His Tabernacle,  that will incur His judgement.  1 Corinthians 12: 1


&lt;u&gt;The Blossoming Staff&lt;/u&gt;

Yahweh instructs Moshe to conduct yet another “test” to prove Aahron’s chosen-ness as the Kohen Gadol (High Priest).  Each one of the twelve tribal heads should place their staff in the Sanctuary; Aahron, as the head of the tribe of Levi, will place his staff as well.  Each should write his name on his staff. “And it shall come to pass that the man’s staff, whom I shall choose, shall blossom; and I will put to rest the murmuring of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.”  (17: -15)

And Moshe placed the rods before Yahweh in the Tent of the Testimony and the staff of Aahron for the house of Levi blossomed, producing budding fruit, and bore ripe almonds.   The Aramaic Targum Onkelos says, “ the rod of Aharon of the house of Levi had germinated, and produced branches, and had blossomed, and ripened almonds”.   This was a miracle that superseded natural laws of operation that a dead branch should germinate, produce branches and go through the fruit-producing stages in one night. 

What a miracle and a powerful sign!   It was that which brought the people to the realisation that they were in error and had been under judgement from the Almighty.  Moshe then brought out all the rods from before Yahweh to them, and they looked, and took every leader his staff. ahweh then instructs that Aahron’s staff should be returned and placed there as a memorial and testimony for future generations of His choice and ordination of Aahron and his sons to the priesthood for the whole tribe of Levi. In the records of the Rabbis (Yoma 52b), there is recorded the the Ark was hidden in the time of Josiah together with the bottle which contained the manna, and Aahron’s rod.


&lt;u&gt;The Priesthood&lt;/u&gt;

And the children of Israel spoke to Moshe, saying: “Because of the people’s reaction, Yahweh reiterates that it is the Kohanim, assisted by the Levites, who bear the responsibility of serving in proximity to the Divine, where the slightest digression has most drastic consequences. All “strangers” (those not anointed and chosen to ministry) are warned to keep their distance.   The text goes on to repeat and reaffirm the duties and the ordinances of the priesthood.

The Levites and the Kohanim will receive no portion in the Land when it is divided among the tribes and families of Israel. The people, in whose stead the Kohanim and Levites serve in the Sanctuary, are to support them with the ordained mattanot kehunah, “gifts to the priesthood.” A number of these 24 “gifts” are enumerated in the closing chapter of Korach:

The Talmud mentions twenty-four offerings, which the Israelites set apart for the priests (Chulín 133b). Ten of them were eaten by the priests in the courts of the temple, four in Yerushalayim, and ten in any city within the land of Israel.

Offerings that were consumed in the temple area:
1.      Parts of cattle that was offered as a sin offering.
2.      Parts of a bird that was offered as a sin offering.
3.      Guilt offerings.
4.      Pending guilt offerings.
5.      Parts of the congregational peace offerings during Shavuot, see Leviticus 23:19.
6.      The remains of the oil that was used to cleanse a leper, see Leviticus 14:10ff.
7.      The two bread loafs that were offered during Shavuot, see Leviticus 23:17.
8.      The show bread, see Exodus 25:30; Leviticus 24:5-9.
9.      The remains of the meal offerings.
10.  The remains of the omer-offering, see Leviticus 23:10.


Offerings consumed in Yerushalayim:
11.  The remains of the firstborn of male cattle that is kasher and has been offered on the altar.
12.  The first fruit (bikurim).
13.  Parts of the offering of thanksgiving and the goat of the Nazarite, Leviticus 7:11-14; Numbers 6:19.
14.  The skin from the offerings, see Leviticus 7:8.


Offerings consumed in any city within Eretz Israel:
15.  The consecrated part of the harvest (trumah).
16.  The tithe of the Levites (which was given to the priests out of the tithes that they received).
17.  The cake that was taken out of the dough (challah).
18.  The first wool from the shearing of the sheep.
19.  The breast, jaws, and stomach of every animal that had been worked (even though it was not an offering animal).
20.  The ransom money of a firstborn son (pidyon ha-ben), see Numbers 18:15-16.
21.  The ransom money of a firstborn donkey, see Exodus 13:13.
22.  A field that was dedicated to HaShem and had not been redeemed within the appointed time, Leviticus 27:16-21.
23.  A field of priestly possession that had been dedicated as “cherem”, see Numbers 18:14.
24.  Resources that were stolen from a convert and returned by the thief after he had died without an heir, see Numbers 5:7-8.


&lt;u&gt;The Judgement&lt;/u&gt;

Moshe, who was the meekest of men, held his peace and first went to Yahweh to seek wisdom and direction as to know how to respond.   Yahweh commands the people to separate themselves from the rebels in 16:20-21.  Does this not recall a warning in Revelation 18:4 where Yahweh urges his people to separate themselves from Babylon (a rebellious, Antichrist system) so as not to be a partaker of her sins and plagues?  See also 2 Corinthians 5:17.  
Even after Yahweh’s tremendous display of powerful judgment against the rebels (16:41) the people still continued in their complaining. Man is very arrogant and right in his own eyes and will defend himself even to the death.  How many times do we face Yahweh’s judgment in our lives (perhaps health issues, financial troubles, broken relationships, legal problems, etc.) but still refuse to repent and change our attitude toward others and our Heavenly Father?  How long will we refuse to obey the laws of Yahweh?   How long will we insist on doing things our way, instead of Yahweh’s way?  The choice is ours: obey Yahweh and be blessed, disobey and suffer the long and short-term consequences.

In Ch.16:35 we see an example of Yahweh’s judgment. These 250 men were the wrong men (they were not priests) offering the right fire (from the altar) up to Yahweh.  He has his prescribed method of how men are to approach him.  Leaders carry greater responsibility to not lead the people astray and will come under greater judgment if they do.

Moshe was a true intercessor or intermediary between Yahweh and the people, a picture of Yeshua who is our advocate (legal representative) before Yahweh. Yahweh wanted to destroy the people for their unending rebellion and murmuring yet Moshe and Aaron interceded on their behalf and many lives were saved.  Yahweh had to take strong disciplinary actions against Yisrael to root out humanistic/democratic rebelliousness. The fear of Yahweh is finally reestablished in 17:12-13, though Yisrael never really demonstrates heartfelt repentance. They changed their attitude to save their skin from a furious Almighty One!
The rebellion of Korach ended with devastating results.  Korach and his followers were swallowed up by the earth, and the 250 who offered incense were consumed by fire.  Those Yisraelites who continued to complain that Moshe and Aharon were responsible for the deaths of holy people were stricken with a plague, and more than 14,000 died.
As further proof of Aaron’s greatness and confirmation that he is Yahweh’s choice, from all the princes’ staffs, Yahweh makes Aharon’s staff bloom and produce almonds miraculously.  This demonstrated that that his ministry was anointed of Yahweh.  The rod represented his authority and its budding represented the fruitfulness of his ministry and that He chose Aharon himself to perform all the services in the Mishkan.   The fruit of a person’s ministry is always the test of their anointing.


&lt;u&gt;Warning Against Rebellion&lt;/u&gt;

The Book of Jude is a warning against rebellion and moral perversion.   This whole book is about how men rebel against divine authority and turn from the common salvation (Yeshua) and the faith once delivered to the saints (v. 3), go on a downward path of moral and spiritual decay so that the grace of God is turned into lasciviousness (unrestrained moral looseness) (verses. 7-8).  These moral and spiritual perverts and apostates don’t want anyone to be their “Lord” and to tell them what to do. They are so full of lust and perversion that they will deny God before they will reign in and repent of their evil. This is the state of our society religiously and culturally today!   The Rebellion of Korach is a prophetic warning to end-times believers.  Jude 11

#Cain = humanism (my way, not Yahweh’s way); 
#Balaam = greed; 
#Korach = rebellion and lust for power

Also, just like Korach and his associates, such people are overtaken with such arrogance that they go on in their own way completely blinded to the truth and unrepentant in their ways.  This can be seen when Moshe, in his wisdom and temperance, gave them time to reconsider the proposed test of their claim to priesthood and its consequences.   They continued on in the course of their folly and as a result, incurred the judgement of Yahweh. 


&lt;u&gt;The Spirit of Antichrist&lt;/u&gt;

The rabbis note that Korach and his malcontent followers had come under the power of resentment which grew and festered until open rebellion broke out.  Korach was a fellow Levite and cousin of Aaron who was “overlooked” for the priesthood and were relegated to merely assistants to the priests.  He was also a firstborn of his household (Exod. 6:21) and when the Tabernacle sacrificial service was inaugurated Aaron’s sons replaced the firstborn Yisraelites in offering sacrifices.  Furthermore, Dathan, Abiram and On were of the tribe of Reuben, the first born child of Jacob.  These men had their own grudge since Reuben had lost his birthright as the firstborn son to the sons of Joseph.  Resentment leads to bitterness, which leads to separation and to uprising, which genders accusation, leading to outright rebellion against Yahweh-ordained authority.  This usurpation of authority led to judgment and death.  This is the path Lucifer took in his rebellion against Yahweh God.  Lucifer Was the Original Rebel.

Isaiah 14:12-14, “How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation [i.e., Mt. Moria. His presence is now there in the Dome of the Rock!], in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.&quot;
Notice all the “I wills...” Satan the original rebel is the originator of humanism the exaltation of man over Yahweh.    The earth swallows Korach and company (Num. 16:32) even as Satan, the originator of the rebellion, will be cast into the bottomless pit.


&lt;u&gt;The Tithe 18:21&lt;/u&gt; 

Yahweh sanctifies and elevates the ministry of the Levites (18:1-7) and the ministry of the Aaronic priesthood (18:8-20) by defining each one’s offering and the tithe which goes to the Levites (18:21-32).     The Children of Yisrael were to pay a a tenth of their income to support the Levites (who ministered to them and taught them Yahweh’s Torah).  Although a different order of priesthood is now in place, the tithe is still for the support of those who minister to the people.  In 1 Timothy 5:17 -18 we read, “Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine. For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward.” 
Just as those who served in the temple ate of the tithes, offering-gifts, and offerings, those who serve by preaching and teaching in the Messiah’s assembly have the right to live by the tithes and offerings.

* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.

== esoteric templates ==

You mentioned that you have been working on esoteric templates lately. Would you be interesting to helping to improve [[Help:Advanced templates]]? I recently scrapped what was there and started fresh. What was there was largely outdated, unmaintained and very hard to follow. I think having multiple eyes working on it could help to make understanding esoteric templates much easier for the average person. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:09, 28 January 2009 (UTC)

:For what little my input might be worth (and what little time I actually have to devote to yet another part of wikibooks on any given week), I'm certainly willing to try to be helpful.  (My fatuous remark over at template_talk:wikipedia was, inasmuch as it served any useful purpose, a way of saying that I'm currently unlikely to forget to flush the cache when testing a template.)

:What is meant to be happening?  There seem to be three pages still with content, all with merge tags &amp;mdash; and BTW each merge tag unfortunately links to the talk page of ''that page'', so that even the two that are proposed to merge with each other wouldn't have their merges discussed in a single place.  To my mind, all the merge tags would ideally link to a single section of a single talk page.  I've also been reviewing [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion/Help:A quick guide to templates]], but that too has the familiar feeling of walking into the middle of a complicated conversation...  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 12:50, 28 January 2009 (UTC)

:: For what its worth, I was actually thinking of FlaggedRevs' caching for stable revisions which might of effected the use of a template on some page when I made the remark about revision cache in my edit summary to {{tlx|wikipedia}}.
:: Besides the proposals to delete some help pages and some discussion that has happened on [[Help talk:Contents]] there isn't really anything going on discussion-wise that I know of. I think some goals are to improve the help pages to make them current and useful for new users and contributors of Wikibooks, and to use a consistent style for pages along the way. So far this seems to have taken on the form of rewriting completely or large portions of help pages, trying to keep explanations simple, and trying to use diagrams, tables, examples, etc. that are self-explanatory.
:: I think the merge templates use to link to the same discussion page, I'm not sure what's happened, I guess I'll look into it. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:45, 28 January 2009 (UTC)

I've noticed that on your [[Conlang]] pages, your navigation links are not working. Not being familiar with the &quot;esoteric&quot; templates you created, I couldn't say whether it's your list of pages or the template that is the problem. However, I thought I'd point it out. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:05, 18 June 2009 (UTC)

: Adding the category markup to Conlang/Navlist broke the navboxes, and the noincludes I added later didn't fix it because they weren't noinclusive enough.  The immediate problem is fixed now; thanks.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 19:00, 18 June 2009 (UTC)

== Noincludes around BookCat ==

I don't think you need them. It should evaluate properly when the template it's put in is transcluded onto a book's page. The additional benefit is that helps categorize any new pages that are created with the book template used in them. Correct me if I've missed an instance where this isn't desirable, though. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:53, 24 June 2009 (UTC)

: Depends on where the template will be used.  For example, if a template is used inside a link, extra markup in the expansion will disable the link (which is what happened when category markup was added to [[Conlang/Navlist]]).  If a template is used on a talk page, there shouldn't be a call to BookCat in the expansion, because BookCat will file the talk page in&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:Talk:My Book&lt;/tt&gt;}}.  (If there's a simple way to detect talk spaces, we could modify BookCat to suppress output when called from those.)  The dicier the template, the more cautious I'd be inclined to be about it.  Some of the techniques being used in [[False Friends of the Slavist]] are fairly dicey.  I'm downright paranoid about Navlist.

: That said, you're right, there should be at least a few of those False Friends of the Slavist templates that don't need the noincludes; the sheer mind-numbing repetition of all those&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Template:FFWhatever&lt;/tt&gt;}}'s has had me just cutting and pasting the same generic markup onto ''everything''.  I'll think about which FF templates are safe to de-noinclude.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 22:40, 24 June 2009 (UTC)

::I've changed the code so that only Wikijunior and the main namespace get the standard BookCat code, with the Template: and Category: namespaces still getting their custom code. No worries about any of the namespaces that aren't specifically defined in {{tlx|BookCat}} anymore. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:26, 24 June 2009 (UTC)

::: There's also the&amp;nbsp; &lt;tt&gt;Cookbook:&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; namespace (I'd forgotten about that myself).  I think I'd recommend listing excluded cases rather than listing included ones.  To exclude talk spaces, how about this:  Wrap the old version of BookCat markup &amp;mdash; the one with just three cases, Template Category and #default &amp;mdash; in a conditional that compares FULLPAGENAME to TALKPAGENAME, and does nothing if they're the same.
:::: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#ifeq:{{FULLPAGENAME}}|{{TALKPAGENAME}}|| ... }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
::: Another specific exception might be made, I suppose, for&amp;nbsp; &lt;tt&gt;Subject:&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; space.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 00:48, 25 June 2009 (UTC)

:::: I don't know why it would be used in any of those namespaces, but I suppose it can't hurt. [[Image:Yes_check.svg|15px| ]] '''Done''' -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:01, 25 June 2009 (UTC)

== [[Wikijunior:Languages/Portuguese]] ==
I've reworded, corrected and extended the information. See if you agree with the changes. I also attempted to transfer to the content the notion that people were not directly forced to learn Portuguese and that no coordination of efforts was made to promote the language (or is still being made at least in level equal to other languages like English, French or even Spanish).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:12, 25 January 2010 (UTC)

One thing that is still missing is the [[w:Flag of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (it isn't on Wikimedia Commons) and [[w:Reforms of Portuguese orthography]] that to my understanding is now rectified (the Wikipedia article doesn't reflect that).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:23, 25 January 2010 (UTC)

Made also a small change to the description of colonization on the [[Wikijunior:Languages/French]] page. The later English colonization was not as peaceful, even in the long run, but it was too harsh a wording, used in part what was added to the Portuguese page and made a distinction to North America.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:33, 25 January 2010 (UTC)

== [[Template:Conworld/Sub-book]] ==

How did my change mess up formatting?  It's a box floating to the side and I checked several of the pages using it and didn't see any problems.  Can you point me to a page it messed up? -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:20, 23 April 2010 (UTC)

:I observed a couple of anomalies whose specific common cause, if they have one, is unclear.  (Keep in mind &amp;mdash; this occasionally matters &amp;mdash; that I'm viewing these pages with Javascript turned off, which is the way I almost always operate.)  [[Conhistory]] ended up with text overlapping with the colored border of the box, but I might not have noticed that if I hadn't gone looking; what I immediately checked was [[Conlang]] (of course), and it had wrecked the layout there.  Instead of some text on the left, the flag image in the middle, and a stack of two notices on the right (with their blue borders effectively blending into one), it came out as a clutter of three boxes of miscellaneous height and style strung out horizontally all the way across the top of the page.  Besides which, the ambox had smaller text &amp;mdash; if I hadn't found problems on another transcluding page I'd probably have customized Conlang to use mbox-side directly.

:What was the motive for switching to ambox?  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:35, 23 April 2010 (UTC)

::I noticed you put comments on the talk page of the template.  I've responded there with explanations for possible formatting errors and the motivation for the change. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:44, 23 April 2010 (UTC)

== What is Wikibooks ==
Just a small point regarding the last change.  The bit &quot;...such as proposing theories and solutions...&quot; is problematic since solution based on established theories and practices are good content. I know the difficulty of coming to a consistent text, but that section is becoming too verbose and redundant on the affirmations it makes without providing any good clarification. In that regard I think the examples of unwanted content should be moved to the back of the section and &quot;solutions&quot; (the word) be removed (I can't come up with a good substitute that would make it less objectionable, unless extending the text even further to provide the distinction, the text already points to &quot;If you have done primary research on a topic, publish your results in normal peer-reviewed journals, or elsewhere on the web,&quot;). I will tweak that last bit.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:11, 31 May 2010 (UTC)

See if you agree or see any problem...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:26, 31 May 2010 (UTC)

Seemingly the use of &quot;seem&quot;, seems problematic. I seem to, in a seemly manner, avoid it most of the time. The word and its relatives. But seemingly it is still very popular, if badly used most of the time. Do you know if the subject is well covered on the [[Subject:English language]] ? Can you point me to a good location. Most google searches I made on the subject point to extremely convoluted or unreliable discussions. Thanks.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:19, 1 June 2010 (UTC)

:There's nothing special about the verb ''to seem''.  The third person plural is &quot;seem&quot; (as in &quot;they seem&quot;), while the third person singular is &quot;seems&quot; (as in &quot;it seems&quot;).  &quot;Some bugs&quot; is a third person plural subject, so it takes the third person plural form of the verb.

:The wince-worthily bad grammar of &quot;There seems to be some bugs&quot; is the sort of thing that one can often forgive in ''spoken'' English, on the grounds that the speaker started out by speaking the first part of the sentence, and didn't plan out the end of the sentence until they'd already committed to the first part &amp;mdash; so that the singular verb was already &quot;out of their mouth&quot; (or at least, on its way down the neural pipeline thereto) before the plural subject had been chosen.  &quot;There seems to be...&quot;, and only after having already said that, &quot;some bugs&quot;.  There is no such excuse when writing, though.  (Much of the electronic text on the Internet is, in effect, transcribed speech rather than &quot;writing&quot; in the traditional sense of &quot;formal writing&quot;.  The key difference is that traditional writing is composed by an iterative process that is able to apprehend the whole, and thus avoid this sort of lag-based subject&amp;ndash;verb disagreement.)

:In the hope of simply ''avoiding'' the immediate practical problem, I've proposed a rephrasing of the sentence that doesn't use the verb ''to seem''.  I'm only guessing that your difficulty (and, apparently, Thenub's) is tied to that verb.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 12:07, 1 June 2010 (UTC)

==Grammar==
Hi, I am not quite sure how, but I seemed to have been editing an old version when I changed your sentence at [[:Category:Pages where template include size is exceeded‎]] with the explanation &quot;grammar&quot;. My face is even more red when I realized the version I put up wasn't quite correct.  As the british say, &quot;Good show&quot;.

:This is, I think, the second time I've heard of an incident on Wikibooks in which it seemed that somehow an old version was edited.

{{tl|shortcut}} adds an anchor to the page at the location it's specified at, using the shortcut value specified. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:16, 13 June 2010 (UTC)

:Yes, I noticed that, and experimented with it.  However, it doesn't go to the top of the section, but awkwardly to a point slightly further down on the page, just below the top of the shortcut box (like [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks#WB:SOURCE|this]]).  I was trying it out because it allows for more robust redirects and because it allows shortcuts that use # (like&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;WB:WIW#OR&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp; and so on); but it's got a nasty side-effect.  When you edit a section with an anchor in its title, the anchor markup is included in the default edit summary.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 16:45, 13 June 2010 (UTC)

== A new maintenance template? ==

It seems to be an organizational weakness of the way we have things set up that {{nowrap|[[Template:Rfd|the template provided]]}} for proposing discussion of a page deletion has built into it the assumption that the discussion will be here [at RFD].  The process of discussing a page deletion within the book community is implied by the fact that consensus at the book is {{nowrap|[[WB:Deletion policy#Speedy deletions|speedy-deletion criterion 4]]}}, but the template structurally discourages it.  We ought to have things set up to encourage trying local discussion first before coming here.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 14:43, 30 June 2010 (UTC)

: I think {{nowrap|{{tlx|rfd}}}} is fine as is and serves its purpose well, but I think you do have a point about the need to have a way to alert book contributors that there is a discussion on the talk page about whether to delete a page. How about a new maintenance template like {{nowrap|{{tlx|qr del}}}} to match up with some of the other query templates available? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:14, 30 June 2010 (UTC)

:: What I envision seems somewhat different from a {{tl|qr-em}} (or a Wikipedia [[w:template:prod|prod]]).  A query/prod is primarily oriented toward the outcome of no local discussion, in which case it escalates to a speedy-deletion request.  Here, I think the preferred outcome is local discussion, which is more like, say, {{tl|mergeto}}.  (And of course escalation if it happens is to an RFD rather than a SPEEDY.)  Of course, {{tl|mergeto}} may sit around for months or years without anything coming of it &amp;mdash; but it isn't actually ''necessary'' that that not happen here, either; it's just that if there isn't any local response at all after a reasonable time, it's okay (not necessary, but okay) to escalate to an RFD.

:: BTW, is there a standard length of time to wait, after proposing a structural reorganization of a book, before assuming that the book is abandoned and adopting it?  (I'm sure I've heard this advice given a few times, but I don't remember it clearly.)  That would seem to be much the same sort of situation as locally proposing a page deletion and then waiting before escalating to an RFD.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 19:32, 30 June 2010 (UTC)

:::It occurs to me that a straightforward name for it might be {{tl|local rfd}}.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 19:42, 30 June 2010 (UTC)

::::I've seen it stated that a book is abandoned if noone responds in a week. That's on the short side, certainly.  On the other hand, I've seen one person come running the same day after being gone for months because the page was on their watchlist and they had it set to email them on changes.  That's another argument for such a template, in that another person like that wouldn't come back after a sabbatical to find their book nominated for deletion with the clock ticking to improve it before consensus turns against them. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 19:47, 30 June 2010 (UTC)

::: I'm not tied up on a specific template name. I don't see query templates as moving towards a specific outcome though. FWIW Query templates are intended as a middle road where what happens next depends on whether discussion surfaces or not.

&lt;small&gt;(I know this is a public page but would like that if Pi zero doesn't object, that the dialog would run without any intervention from other parties, this should be considered a private dialog between me and Pi zero, other user may create another thread for any intervention or comment)&lt;/small&gt;
#We have discussed your situation and it was found that we don't have any motive to block you locally, in fact it has been determined by the normal decision process that the block should not stand as there is no consensus to support it.
#The only voice objecting to restore you to the normal was by Mike but based in unsubstantiated allegations that you are globally banned.
#Mike has unilaterally and without backing from the community reblocked you (in violation of the local policy) in a reversal of the action by Adrignola in behalf of the community.
#At present you are in fact in limbo, you shouldn't consider yourself blocked or banned by the Wikibooks community but without an admin willing to act there is nothing more we can do.
#This situation you find yourself is not new and is based on the fact that no one is obliged to act, it is comprehensible that Adrignola has excused himself to continue to act further on the subject.

I think these are the only facts I presented, as a reply to the user request for &quot;'''summarize for me about where we stand on this process, and what is the pathway ahead for us?'''&quot;. I understand that you don't agree with how I see the situation and would like to understand 
in what we diverge.

I will again state how I see each point and why, it will be a bit of a repetition but since you didn't participate from the beginning it may help us to find a common ground.

1 - I'm particularly referring to the more general exposition to the community of the situation that I initiated in 8 August 2010 (not the start of the discussion and analysis of the problem, that was started with the block of the user in his talkpage) resulting in changes that in 10 August 2010 permitted the user to finally formalize a request for unblock, leading me to initiate a countdown of 3 days since the situation was pending resolution as of 5 May 2010 and the block was yet to be validated per request of the steward. In 13 August 2010 and without any opposition besides the harassment made by Mike, Adrignola under normal practices and with the express support of several other Wikibookians acted to restore normality to the situation, since Mike never provided any validity for his argumentation in 13 August 2010 we had a consensus of no support for the blocking the user.

2 - No validation to the claims were presented, in fact I personally talked to the steward that originated the first block and examined the other project as to verify the claims Mike made, no validity was found. This is also corroborated by other Wikibookians posts, Mike is the only one defending that position on Wikibooks (That &quot;Thekohser is banned from all WMF projects.&quot;).

3 - By contradicting the action of Adrignola at 13 August 2010 Mike acted unilaterally and in contravention to all other statements made, all against the continuation of the situation (at this point and due to the visibility of the discussion it must be considered that the will of the community was not respected), by the claims and retorts made by Mike there can be no contest to the fact that Mike's action is a violation of the administrators policy and the expressed will of the community.

4 - Since the user has never been blocked locally by a local admin except by Mike (3x IIRC and if we count the sock puppet), we never got a consensus about blocking the user or a violation of our rules that permitted the block to be performed. The user status is pending administrative action to resets the user to normal.

5 - I don't see what you can dispute on this one.

These are the facts, do you disagree or reasonably see how they can be interpreted in another way ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:15, 27 August 2010 (UTC)

=== Some thoughts ===

In order to try to sort out the relations between our views, I'm going to first describe some of my positions, and then comment on your items one at a time.  The two lists don't line up one-to-one, which is why I'm keeping them separate.

* Mike.lifeguard is a Wikibooks admin who happens to be (just recently) a Steward.  Mike's admin actions on Wikibooks are therefore not necessarily outside interference.
:* In this particular case, I don't think the local effect of Mike's global action constitutes outside interference, either.  (I'm not interested, for this comment anyway, in whether or not it's legitimate as a global action.)  The only way IMO it could be seen as outside interference would be if Mike actually thought, when doing it, that its local effect on Wikibooks would not be in the best interests of Wikibooks.  It seems clear that Mike considered the local effect of that global action to be in the best interests of Wikibooks; therefore, I do not consider it outside interference. If we were to count on external evidences the fact that the user was recently restored to freedom on Wikiversity would have then have also an impact.
:::P01 --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:55, 30 August 2010 (UTC)

* Blocking is ultimately a matter of judgment by admins.  The Wikibooks policy even says that, although it's not as explicit as it might be about the corollary &amp;mdash; that the rest of the blocking policy is ''guidance''.  We choose admins that we trust to use the tools ''only'' in the best interests of Wikibooks, and then instead of just turning them loose, we give them general guidance on what is going to be acceptable or unacceptable to us.  Such guidance can't be followed properly without exercising common sense, which is one of the reasons we have sapient admins.  I like the way the Wikinews blocking policy makes both of these key points right up front (which is a very Wikinewsie thing to do &amp;mdash; comparatively, the Wikipedia policy buries the lead):
::&quot;In certain circumstances it may be necessary for an admin to block a user or IP address in the best interests of the site.  It is up to admins to use their discretion to decide when to block, and how long for, however for guidance: ...&quot;
::It goes on to talk about when blocking is appropriate and when it isn't; but it's already been made very clear, up front, that that's guidance.  The Wikibooks policy has the same nature, but doesn't do as good a job of clarifying how the parts fit together.
:::P02 --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:55, 30 August 2010 (UTC)

* When the Wikibooks blocking policy talks about circumstances under which blocking would be an abuse of the tools, it excepts users demonstrably disruptive to the community.  Again, that's guidance subject to common sense.  It doesn't say what constitutes demonstration (nor should it).  What constitutes demonstration ''on Wikibooks'' is already a matter that requires judgment; and judgment is also called for when considering evidence beyond actions taken on this project.  It's possible for evidence outside the project to be irrelevant, and possible for it to be relevant; common sense applies.
:P03 --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:55, 30 August 2010 (UTC)

* A community discussion on unblocking a user is just that: a community discussion.  It's a valuable way for the community to evolve its thinking about the issues involved, and for admins to tap into that thinking.  It's ''not'' binding on anyone, per se.
:P04 --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:55, 30 August 2010 (UTC)

* Assumption of good faith, as a principle, doesn't ''necessarily'' apply to someone who has demonstrated lack of good faith in the past.
:P05 --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:55, 30 August 2010 (UTC)

Now, about your points.

1 - I see a couple of difficulties with this statement.
:* As far as I can see, there is no normal process for deciding whether a block should stand (such decisions are not a normal situation); the discussion that there was, was on the short side (which matters only in proportion to how high a quality of consensus one wants out of the discussion &amp;mdash; but for such a serious matter one would presumably aspire to a high quality); and even if there ''were'' a normal process for deciding whether a block should stand, one of the questions to be decided in this case would be whether the default, in the absence of consensus, should be to keep the block or remove it.  So if the consensus is on shaky ground, then the judgment of what to do in the absence of consensus would also seem to be on shaky ground.
:* Whatever level of agreement there was when the process was &quot;completed&quot;, there is less than that now; so, simply saying that the decision was made is an incomplete depiction of the situation.
:P06 --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:55, 30 August 2010 (UTC)

2 - In a moment of sanity, I decided not to go back and actually check all of Mike's comments in the discussion, to see if the existence of a global ban was the sole basis of Mike's objections there &amp;mdash; but then the moment passed, and I went back and checked.  The global ban was not the sole basis of Mike's objections.
:P07 --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:55, 30 August 2010 (UTC)

3 - I disagree that Mike's action was in violation of local policy.  (Many of my positions and comments above contribute to this.)
:P08  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:55, 30 August 2010 (UTC)

4 - This one is patently false.  Thekohser is in fact blocked, by Mike, who is a Wikibooks admin.  &quot;The Wikibooks community&quot; doesn't block users; that is done by admins, such as the local admin who did it in this case.
:P09 --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:55, 30 August 2010 (UTC)

5 - The phrasing of this seems to be based &amp;mdash;but implicitly, so that it's hard to be sure&amp;mdash; on the premise that the block is invalid.  That's not the case.

(I'd write some sort of summary at the bottom, here, but I actually ran off the end of my allocated time block... a while ago, as you might have guessed from the way my later comments got shorter.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 04:42, 30 August 2010 (UTC)

:I will probably mess this up a bit since it would require a lot of copy-paste to contextualize my comments. Feel free to reshape it as you like, if it confuses you (I personally don't like people inserting text inside my posts).
:Some of the issues we are discussing goes outside of the established rules we have, but we can address them by our own view points based in acknowledging that both of us have the best interests of the project and the morality and rationality behind the events.

:'''P01''' - That is a contradiction and oversimplification. A contradiction because he basis his actions on outside events (by his own admission), even if I agree with you that he acted locally as an admin.
:Would you sanction an admin &lt;u&gt;unilaterally&lt;/u&gt; blocking a registered user here because the user was blocked at Wikipedia ? (We don't do that, even unregistered users have a special treatment and are given special considerations, you can read more on previous discussions about open proxys) Or even more problematic case, would you accept to block a user that was condemned in court, lets say for rape or murder ?
:I know that the subject is problematic but it relates to the motivation behind the action, the relation about the blocked user actions and the &quot;danger&quot; to our project and a need to establish a limit of our scope, as also the freedom that admins have to exert personal judgments. In fact it is clear that Mike stretched that freedom, beyond the acceptable, by consecutively ignoring stated objections and refusing to provide any sort of validation. 
:And a oversimplification because the user was not initially blocked by Mike as an admin but by a Steward, with a statement that clearly indicates that the community should validate the situation. If the first was not sufficient, this second fact makes it clear that it was a situation brought to our project from the outside...  

:'''P02''' - No, the administrative policy is not a guideline it is a policy, it must be enforced (policies tend to be also more carefully written we shouldn't expect them to intentional give great latitude to interpretation). Admins are free to block but are required to validate their actions by our rules and be rational not violating the BeBold policy, if they expect opposition then they should initiate a discussion. The administrative policy clearly states conditions that a admin shall not block. The user does not fill any of the present conditions therefore it shouldn't be locally blocked by an admin.
:Mike's actions have clearly not been on the best interest of Wikibooks that was made evident not simply by ignoring the direct objections to his actions (as required by BeBold), but by the discussion that took place to validate the steward block, in that discussion he was the only opposing voice, his attempt to &quot;abort&quot; the process was clear, that is demonstrated by his participation on that discussion, that is why I refereed to it as harassment, it shouldn't be acceptable for an admin to act in that way at least without demonstratively provide evidence about his allegations, as was required. 
:Sadly we don't have a block policy (aside from the expectations about how admins should act), in any case in the discussion about the validity of the steward block it was clearly established that the user did not present any danger to the project, that in fact he has been a productive Wikibookian. Having the user blocked clearly is prejudicial to Wikibooks not only by the potential of the user but as the message it gives to the other Wikibookians and because it would just be the path of less resistance and lower conflict, if in fact the user misbehaved or WMF decided to block it the subject would be closed.

:'''P03''' - I agree with you in general terms with this view. But not in this particular event, there was a clear opposition to the actions and the community clearly (from the beginning of the block) established that the user was not dangerous, this is corroborated by evidence and no evidence to the contrary was presented, even the alleged issues outside of Wikibooks that people brought forward did not validate any preemptive action. In fact we should by default avoid preemptive actions in our project as any damage can be easily reverted.  

:'''P04''' - In general terms this view is problematic, and we already had a problem with it in regards to my own account. We don't have a block policy but even if I regard that special consideration should be given to the acting admin (the one that blocked), by the normal law about reversions and the precedence of consensual decision (communal or not) any action not previously validated by a consensus decision shall be undone until a consensus is archived by an effort to reach a compromise, if it fails to materialize then the action is not consensual, with all the regards to situations of block (like the recent block attempt made to the editfilters). As I have stated that law is the basis of the BeBold and the way we validate any issue, for instance it was made clear in regards to the restitution of the Check User tool. That is the only viable way to address conflicts and prevent prevarications. 
 
:'''P05''' - Assuming good faith is a highly problematic premise (that is the reason that the text is a draft), it is a good starting point to any relations on Wikis but it can quickly be seen as unrealistic and it an extremely fuzzy notion, good faith toward what? In fact I expect that several Wikibookia  don't see Mike's actions as in good faith, especially toward the project, clearly not toward that user, as he clearly didn't act impartially and I don't have any expectations that thinks that I have any expectation in his good faith, I made that clearly so when I've gone out of my way to make it clearly stated when I voted against his position as a steward.
:I had however until now an expectation that he would defend our project's best interest, but these recent actions clearly demonstrates that he doesn't. It was repeatedly requested that he closed the issue himself by backing up his actions or by fixing them himself. A clear headed admin would have excused himself from acting more on the issue after the first objections regarding silencing the user on his own talk page.

:'''P06''' - The discussion was running long before I made the issue public to the community (as there was no expectation that people should be aware, besides the administration, that should review the logs, especially the block logs regarding registered users), if you are raising the issue of time I already cleared that point and the way normalization of a contested action should occur. Blocks or unblocks are not specifically stated as a community decision, there is no requirement regarding how publicly announced they should be (I would support making alterations to our draft in regards to make unblock request more visible), the fact is that I established a running process for the discussion an no objection was presented to it and all the arguments made outside of that discussion where considered at least by me (in fact besides Mike no one objected to it in the 7 subsequent days).
:We normally have a 7 days timeframe, but that is only based on practicality, that may vary from situation to situation, and the time may be counted differently being the norm from the last post, barring stated rules that is the normal expectation Wikibookians have), after that time a decision is considered made (for instance in the VfD or Promotion discussions we explicitly close the discussions), in this case the issue is less problematic as we only needed to prove the lack of consensus (I already covered the reasons on another point). So I can clearly state that there is no consensus in the community for the block of the user, this is an established fact.

:'''P07''' This is not extremely relevant as Mike failed to contradict the factually established good intentions of the user, that are even supported by the still unaddressed request for unblock (that was pending the steward request for the community to validate the block). We don't have even to assume good faith. This has to deal with the sequence of the actions is the unblock request addressable if the block is not valid ? If the block is valid then how do we address the unblock as clearly we don't have consensus for the block... 

:'''P08''' I'm not invested on establishing this point. I do disagree with you since by his participation and logged actions he clearly is imposing a personal and objected upon position to the community (he isn't working for the community, and it is at least debatable that he has our community best interests in mind). I know that numbers do not count but it wouldn't be sane not to notice that he acted against the stated objections of other Wikibookians, without a basis on local rules, even violating at least one, he then did escalate the issue by reverting a fellow admin and in general has been a cause of disruption (as is stated on the policy, and by several non productive allegations made during the discussions, or even by his lack of participation in issues that he is at least responsible for). It would be fruitless to act like him and request a pull down of his tools, it would indeed be extremely ironic if someone acted like him and without discussion removed his tools, or even blocked him, locally the ground for that action is stronger than those used to block the user.

:'''P09''' You are contradicting something you said above, admins act for the community, not for themselves. Any action can be objected to and the community can be called to validated anything on Wikibooks. Admins are mere Wikibookians on administrative functions, enforcement power belong to all Wikibookians, the special distinction is that admins are granted the tools to exert some of those functions but for the benefit of the community. They aren't sole representatives of the community or even a special cast of enlightened Wikibookians, it is even dangerous if they coordinate actions and establish restricted interpretations of our rules outside of the community view, participation and control.      

:'''P10''' The block is invalid, as I defended in the above points, it doesn't have the consensual support of the community (if you still disagree then you should address the user request for unblock and close it). In any case the logical step-aside by Adrignola clearly indicates that he has put the good of the project above his personal judgments as to avoid direct and open conflict, he already made his position clear. This contrasts in the way that Mike has acted, in regards to the good of the project. I made several appeals for him to consider the value of pursuing his personal antagonistically position against the blocked user. The present situation is clearly not on the best interest of the project, as I stated, the user will probably be in limbo until someone decides to put things right.   

:I would respect a clear declaration by the WMF to block the user and I'm indeed aware that Pathoschild (the blocking steward) has yet to reply to my last query, in any case I defend that we shouldn't put our spoon in other peoples soup, they should resolve their own problems.

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#if:{{#titleparts:{{{1|{{FULLPAGENAME}}}}}||2}}|{{#titleparts:{{{1|{{FULLPAGENAME}}}}}||2}}|{{{1|{{FULLPAGENAME}}}}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Hi!

I seen that you are assessing Linear Algebra and have contributed to it. It's quite good! Thank you for your contributions!

Yet, I think that I have spotted two flaws that I'd like to draw your attention to. I've posted them on the discussion pages:

[[Talk:Linear_Algebra/Strings]], [[Talk:Linear Algebra/General = Particular + Homogeneous]] and [[Talk:Linear Algebra/Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors]].

I'd be very grateful if you could take a look at my short remarks. [[User:Wisapi|Wisapi]] ([[User talk:Wisapi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wisapi|contribs]]) 19:27, 3 August 2011 (UTC)

== Continuing...  ==
The idea is that if you use continuing there is the implication that a previous state of opposition has to exist (more or less the issue of using remain, it implies that something previous was present). The use of lingering is more versatile in this instance (it implicates delay, since a straw poll wouldn't not occur if all positions were understood, a position of objection not stated or understood can correctly be considered delayed on its expression).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 17:01, 7 September 2011 (UTC)
: I see the same difficulty with &quot;lingering&quot; as you describe with &quot;continuing&quot; and &quot;remaining&quot;, plus to me &quot;lingering&quot; suggests dubious legitimacy.

: Would &quot;unresolved&quot; work better?
:: A call for consensus is made and any unresolved opposition may be measured with a [[w:Straw poll|straw poll]] to determine the degree of consensus.

::Seems to work.

== WCI 2011 Proposal :Accelerating Wikibooks. Help Needed! ==

Hello!

I will be delivering a Talk at the Wikimedia Conference India 2011 on the topic of &quot;Accelerating Wikibooks&quot;.

Over the next few days, I aim to make the proposal more and more wholesome and relevant. I'd like to discuss with you about the proposal and hope you can recommend me a few names on Wikibooks with whom I can discuss this.

I'd be very happy if you could discuss the proposal at [[User:Thewinster/Accelerating_Wikibooks]]

--[[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] ([[User talk:Thewinster|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thewinster|contribs]]) 08:05, 26 September 2011 (UTC)
=== Summary of the proposal ===

This is not a summary of the final talk, only a tentative guideline.

* Create Roadmaps for a book
* Define Learning Outcomes
* Annotate and Discuss new content available from around the web.
* Minor tweaks and fixes which concentrate on crowdsourcing.
* Identifying Small Contribution that advance a book and designing good UIs and triggers according to B.J. Fogg's Behavior Change Model, 8 Step Design Process. The paper can be found here at [http://www.bjfogg.com/design_files/page8_1.pdf Persuasive Design : Eight Step Process by B. J. Fogg]

==Random Wikinews Question==
I just read somewhere the project forked?  What happend? --[[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 23:35, 10 November 2011 (UTC)

: Heh.  More than you wanted to know, I'm sure. :-)

: There's long been a political division at Wikinews over our review standards.  It looks like a sharp division until you look closely at it, and things get really complicated.  It's all mixed up, for example, with the Wikipedian AGF issue.  Anyway, the most discontented Wikinewsies drifted away or resigned, one gathers they found common cause with some who'd resented being told they had to learn to contribute, and finally a couple of ring-leaders created this fork.  Didn't copy our article archive (over eighteen thousand articles), but did copy templates and gadgets and such.

: They contacted individual Wikinewsies off-project and persuaded most of our active reviewers to join the fork.  I'd always said, if one tried to have two different &quot;tiers&quot; of review the upper tier (full publication with push to Google News) would starve because everyone's time would be consumed by trying to fix the lower quality stuff coming through.  Most of the Wikinewsies who left didn't retire from Wikinews, and very occasionally one of them will come by and help out just a bit with the odd administrative task &amp;mdash; but they clearly don't have ''time'' to do anything significant on Wikinews, even if they'd hoped to work both projects.

: And then, of course, it got worse.  One of our remaining actives suffered a bad head injury, and another of our remaining actives resigned from all wmf projects on the grounds that wmf had abandoned their neutrality policy by endorsing Italian Wikipedia's shutdown.  Both of them are at the other project now.  We had two new folks we were training up, but after some training with us they left to work on the other project (and one of them is now turning out to be a major-league troll and sockpuppeteer; go figure).

: There's inevitably some tension, but not actual animosity, between the projects (I'd say, at least on the Wikinews side), and mostly we're on okay terms with Wikinewsies who went over, though we don't hear from most of them much.  We're getting along, and keeping up morale.  We keep the porch light on, our standards up, and review articles that come along (which includes articles from a class of journalism students who've been assigned to learn to write for us as training!).  But certainly things are a lot slower atm at en.wn.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 01:02, 11 November 2011 (UTC)

== AGF ==
I do not support the text being passed as a policy but as a general rule it has been applied and worth defending. The reason why it is at times important to remember people is that even if [[n:Wikinews:Never assume]] is general in life and when dealing with what in not fully comprehended, there is something that we at times forget here on this project we are all volunteers and most come here with a positive intention...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 08:14, 2 April 2012 (UTC)
: But, 'we are all (well, most of us) volunteers and most come here with a positive intention' is itself not an assumption but a deduction, based on our knowledge and experience.  And it only gives us probabilistic information about any individual.

: Volunteer projects thrive on idealism.  The moment when I was actually hooked on Wikipedia was when I read AGF.  I thought, 'wow, the idea of building an encyclopedia based on assuming everyone means well is ''insane''; these people are ''idealists'' &amp;mdash; count me in!'.  It took me about a year on Wikipedia before I reached the deeper understanding that AGF doesn't mean what it says; that's roughly when I discovered [[w:WP:ZEN]].  And then it took me about another year before I felt I grokked what it actually does mean, at its best.  And since then I've spent about three years trying to understand its effect on the dynamics of Wikipedia.  Although idealism ''is'' important to a volunteer wiki, frankly Wikipedia could have gotten that from some other principle.  When I got to Wikinews, after acclimating to Wikipedia's AGF, I thought, 'wow, the idea of building a wiki without AGF is insane' (as I say, by then I'd been thoroughly brainwashed into AGF); 'these people are ''idealists''; count me in!'  I then started on a similar learning curve about 'never assume' on Wikinews as I had about AGF on Wikipedia, only without an existing expression of the principle.  'Never assume' has been best practice on Wikinews practically forever, and we (and I) were struggling to articulate it since about two years ago, but we didn't actually get it written down until about three months ago.  And that is an expression of it tailored to Wikinews; how to generalize it for other sisters, such as Wikibooks, or Wikipedia, is a further challenge that I could imagine taking additional years.

: The bottom line on AGF, for me, goes something like this:  It's misleading because it doesn't mean what it says;&amp;nbsp; what it actually says to do is something that shouldn't be done;&amp;nbsp; and once the user understands what it really means to have people do, doing that too is bad practice (between what it says should be done, and what it means should be done, I believe it's been largely responsible for the long slow deterioration of the atmosphere on Wikipedia)&amp;nbsp; ''and'' the discrepancy &amp;mdash;between what it says and what it means&amp;mdash; teaches people the intellectually dishonest practice of saying one thing while meaning another.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 13:09, 2 April 2012 (UTC)

::I agree with all your analysis, just not that we should let the AGF message pass as idealism. I see no reason for it in a system that relies of consensus (strict consensus if applied correctly), that because of that is conservative in nature (slow changing, if the right of block is respected). In such a system any attempt to subvert AGF becomes impossible. I admit that what you call idealism was part of what attracted my to Wikibooks and fully agree with your analysis that each Wikimedia project is distinct, especially in its political/coordination aspect.
::I actively avoid contributing anything to Wikipedia, at best I use the talk pages to raise points (I may correct some spelling on the articles) and that is it. I confess that Wikinews never attracted me as a reader, or a writer, in fact it is the Wikimedia project that I see as less useful. The first time I became aware of it I was expecting at least a good coverage of what is going on in the Wikimedia's projects but that doesn't even seem to be on the radar...   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 22:00, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

== Resume ==
Sorry about that, sometimes shared commonalities on the languages slips in. Not that it is incorrect, in fact because one word or expression is rare or outdated it does not prevent anyone from bringing it up into use (nor should it, my view is that it enriches the language), on the other side creating new words is indeed more problematic, but shares the same core issue, the lack of common understanding. I have more issues personally with weasel words, PC correctness and erosion of meanings for creating ambiguous understanding about the intentions of what is being stated that spending some effort finding a common ground to understand or remember a words meaning. Kudos for you for understanding what I meant, I was extremely tired when I wrote it, it was not my intention to be obtuse. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 02:50, 6 April 2012 (UTC)

== 7 days conclusion ==
7 days calls to conclusion or for determining consensus have been and are common practice and in accordance with [[Wikibooks:Decision making]].&lt;br&gt;
Multiple examples are abundant, for instance [[Wikibooks talk:Blocking guideline]] and others (it even was a consideration on Mike's discussion regarding global blocking of users).&lt;br&gt;
I personally take offense on how you turned my use of a normal practice as an attempt to bypass or hear your opinion. I also find it disingenuous that you claim that &quot;Wait, didn't I say something earlier about assuming my position was unchanged until-and-unless I retracted it? Wouldn't that mean that the opposition you wanted within seven days already existed at the start of the seven days?&quot; when a request for restatement of opposition is clearly indicated.&lt;br&gt;
More I do sincerely do not believe your claim that you hadn't noticed the statements in a timely fashion, due to the amount of editing I performed on the page and it being put in clear evidence underlined and bold lettering. I had the intention of reminding you to participate but you have been making posts on the same page. So please at least assume that I had no intention to &quot;hide&quot; it from you o4r anyone else, and I will assume that you were indeed blind to what I was doing...

:Some miscellaneous thoughts:
:* Panic, I'm not without sympathy for your plight.  You're aware, I know, that you tend to be verbose; you've remarked on it recently, I believe.  I do suspect you're not conscious of how much of a problem your style can be.  The verbosity of your posts tends to make it difficult to read them, not only because of the length but because it can be difficult to pick out the key points.  There's also more to it than that.  Just as one of '''my''' weaknesses is spending unseen hours revising a comment before posting &amp;mdash;not an exaggeration, in fact some of my shortest posts have taken the most time to write&amp;mdash; you tend to post and then revise, resulting in a large number of edits for a single comment, and leaving the comment unstable when first posted (or even, occasionally, a few days later).  Consequently, to be honest, further edits on your part to a previous post don't tend to attract my attention to the post; rather, I tend to stay away from the post when first submitted out of an awareness it won't be stable, which makes it unfortunately easy to forget to check it later for the stable version.
:* I tend to systematically hedge when talking about others' intentions, because such intentions are largely unknowable by others (as well as sometimes unknown by the person doing the intending), and most often don't ''need'' to be known for the point at hand, anyway.  The one word, I think, in my comment that ''might'', conceivably, be taken as suggesting intent on your part was the word &quot;strategy&quot; &amp;mdash; and even there, I didn't say what I was describing '''was''' your strategy, I said it '''seemed''' to be.  If I'd spent a number of additional hours trying to compose that post, I might have come up with something better (or I might have invested the extra time &amp;mdash;that I didn't have to invest anyway&amp;mdash; without getting anything for it).
:* The point I was trying to make was relevant to the actual thread; it wasn't some private issue to be settled &quot;off line&quot; on user talk pages.  (Indeed, the last time I recall you wanting to take something to user talk pages with me, the net result was that I ended up not having any input into an important discussion on which I had strong opinions that consequently did not get heard. Note, illustrative of one of my previous points, that I'm saying exactly nothing about your intent, which is irrelevant; I'm saying this was the '''consequence''' of the way the weaknesses of my discussion style and the weaknesses of your discussion style interacted).  This is likely related to a difference between my perception and your perception of the nature of the thread, which brings me to my next point.
:* I do not see the seven-days-without-objection principle as applicable to this situation; indeed, it seems far, far too bureaucratic for the informal discussion taking place, and informal discussion is far preferable whenever possible.  (The principle that &quot;voting is evil&quot; can also be generalized, in spirit, to discourage excessive rigidity of form.)  I'll try to comment on that point at the reading room thread &amp;mdash; but, as a short comment seems called for there, even this long and rambling comment here has taken me over an hour to write, and I do have other demands on my time, I don't know how long it will take me to do so.

:::Being verbose may be an issue but was something that I've learned that I must do to be understood, especially when people rarely  read more than the last post on a conversation. This is what I've learned from my time in the project, I do try to be concise.
:::What I disagree is the format and mood you imparted on the reply and in its inaccuracies. If I scold someone I do it in private since if done in public it has other implications.
:::The point you did try to makes was about the format of my actions, open criticism surrounded by some minor veiled innuendos. It was not about your position or mine, it was an abortion of the ongoing process. It could as well been done directly with me.
:::I recognise that you may dislike the time limit but the format is permissive to a request for extension, it is better than leaving a discussion open to an inconclusive and end being automatic archived. If there is something that needs to be formal is discussion proposal, so I strongly disagree with you there. Rigidity has noting to do with the concept of voting, any formal process, especially of decision to be valid and fair has to be established before it starts. The informal part was what the discussion we had before I called for consensus.
:::The problems of not being clear is reflect by how you claimed that my previous summarization was a declaration of consensus.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 18:51, 30 April 2012 (UTC)

:::: Being verbose does not, in itself, impart clarity.  I'm quite willing to believe you've had experiences in the past in which you said less and were misunderstood, but saying more and being misunderstood is also quite possible.  Long statements can easily become very opaque; and while some short statements are unclear, the very clearest statements are short.

:::: I can't tell whether you are ascribing inaccuracies to yourself, or to me.  I tentatively hypothesize that you're claiming my comment had minor veiled innuendos in it, which is false as I understand the word ''[[wikt:innuendo|innuendo]]''; I was not attempting to hint at or veil anything, but rather to be open and honest about my concerns.

:::: Your approach to the discussion was high-handed in the extreme.  I've noticed you have a tendency toward that, which you should watch out for.

:::: On each of the two occasions, as I recall, you claimed afterward not to have made claims about the existence of consensus.  This appears to me to be blatantly false; supposing (as I would prefer to suppose) that neither of us is being disingenuous, this rather strongly reinforces my remarks about failures of clarity (and I'm unsure whether I'm agreeing with you or disagreeing with you on that point).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 21:49, 30 April 2012 (UTC)

::::: I'm also stating that I'm not agreeing or disagreeing with you. I only do not accept that you can extrapolate your own observations (even if I take them as valid for you, and a consideration for future discussions) to a general felling in the community.
::::: &quot;Your strategy here seems to be to flood the thread with words until everyone is sick of the thread and boycotts it, and then claim that what you want has &quot;consensus&quot;.&quot;
::::: It is not your place to speak in behalf of everyone and if you have more information that is not publicly accessible to support the assumption that  &quot;everyone is sick&quot; or &quot;boycotts&quot; discussion because of my verbosity or opacity, I would like to read it so I can better address any flaws. I never claim consensus unless there is at least a clear statement on non objection. I do not support the view of a need for expressed support, this is not always possible or even required to validate well defined decision processes. That requirement generates group-think and statements of support not contributive to the discussions but in political support of participants, this is clearly observable.
::::: Since I had previous refuted it, the phrase &quot;Seems like you may even have twice presented a biased &quot;summary&quot; of what had come before and then claimed consensus (I haven't got the stomach to go back to check exactly how it went down before).&quot; is a compounded misrepresentation of facts that had been corrected by myself. It would be acceptable that you invoked confusion of misunderstanding on your part, but clearly there was no basis to affirm that after my correction, I had made such claims.
::::: &quot;I hadn't even noticed the &quot;unless there is opposition within seven days&quot; clause you'd unilaterally imposed, until just now.&quot;, as we talked before this is if not only a veiled accusation of me attempting to steam-roll the decision, is a grave misinterpretation of something that is normal practice with overtones of declaring me as being acting with bad intentions.
::::: &quot;On each of the two occasions, as I recall, you claimed afterward not to have made claims about the existence of consensus.  This appears to me to be blatantly false&quot; This again includes a veiled accusation that I am at best surreptitious in my actions and a liar at worst. What I said was &quot;It seems that there is a consensus&quot; the key word is &lt;u&gt;seems&lt;/u&gt; and that I clearly indicate that it was intended to &quot;help reformulate the proposal&quot;. This clearly shows that you are in the wrong on your assertion of my actions and that I've been since then attempting to assure you that I had no intention to close the process with a false claim on consensus in favour of my view.
::::: Do you disagree or can prove that I'm being deceptive in attempting that you acknowledge and even retract claims that clearly, even if non intentional, attack my good name and reputation ? That is all I'm after here.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 22:31, 30 April 2012 (UTC)

Thanks, [[User:Liam987|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#808000;border:1px solid;background:#0055A4;text-shadow:0 5px 8px #850000&quot;&gt;'''Liam987'''&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;small style=&quot;font-family:Serif;&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Liam987|Talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 11:52, 25 May 2012 (UTC)
: I did wonder about the sandbox.  The questions raised are
:# who is expected to ''use'' the sandbox; if it'll be used by people who've been around long enough to have been autopromoted to reviewer, it'd seem there can't be any downside to stable-default; and
:# who is expected to ''see'' the sandbox; if it really won't be seen by the young target audience of Wikijunior, there's clearly no need for stable-default.
: A halfway measure is to simply de-sight all the revisions of the page, which should probably be done anyway.
: I had a vague thought that a potential content page named for Wikijunior ought to be default-stable just to avoid possible future confusion (keeping the bookkeeping simple).
: Meanwhile, I'll take a look at the css.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 12:02, 25 May 2012 (UTC)

== Not Spam ==

Hello, I saw you reverting my edits on the notion of them being spam. I would like to know why it is considered spam considering it is a wiki intended for conlanging and offering resources for it. [[User:TheZelos|TheZelos]] ([[User talk:TheZelos|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TheZelos|contribs]]) 10:25, 5 June 2012 (UTC)
: Skipping incidental issues &amp;mdash;and being brutally honest&amp;mdash; the bottom line was that the target of the link screamed &quot;[[wikt:tourist trap|tourist trap]]&quot; &amp;mdash; very '''loud''' advertising that, from its volume alone, represents the commercial gaming industry.  The list of links doesn't contain links with that level of commercialism.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 14:12, 5 June 2012 (UTC)
::I fail to see how those pages comes across as it, but could you check the [http://conlang.wikkii.com/wiki/Category:Guides Link] here and see for yourself that it is no tourist trap or anything, it is just a wiki intended to be a source for information about conlanging. I would appriciate if you could atleast look =) [[User:TheZelos|TheZelos]] ([[User talk:TheZelos|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TheZelos|contribs]]) 06:53, 6 June 2012 (UTC)

:::Is it possible that you thought I hadn't followed the link that you'd added?  In any case, since you ask I've looked over the set of guide pages you now recommend to my attention.

:::Here's how it looked from my perspective; and then I'll have a suggestion for a possible way forward.  The list of &quot;Other resources&quot; on the Conlang wikibook is very spare; it starts, naturally, with those closest to home and works its way cautiously outward &amp;mdash; first, other wikibooks (only one, atm); then, links to sister projects (only atm, and not a very good one, so I should really upgrade that part); then a couple of exceptionally high-quality non-wmf pages (with, at most, conservative commercial information directly relating to the content of the site), to which I can think of at least two others of similar quality that should probably be added; and finally a sublist of fairly commercially-conservative pages of a more specialized class.  Even things like ZBB are not listed atm.  There are, from what I've observed out there, a number of wikis related to conlanging, driven (from what I gather) by commercial advertising and therefore understandably always hungry for ways to rake in more traffic, but none, to be honest, seeming to have anything particularly exceptional about them to make them ''especially'' worthy of inclusion, and I believe most are more developed than the one you added.  And the one you added, at least, has loud commercial-gaming ads splashed across the top of each page that do not appear to have anything really to do with conlanging.  And your natural inclination was to add this link &amp;mdash;''twice''&amp;mdash; to the ''top'' of the list of other resources.

:::If I might suggest a possible course of action.  There are, as I said, a number of wiki/bulletin board/etc. sites out there, and it might be useful to begin collecting ''on the book's main '''talk''' page'' a list of such things; once we have several of them, we might start a subpage of the book to contain the list, to be linked to from the &quot;Other resources&quot; section visible on the main page of the book.  This would allow an outlet for inclusion of such things &amp;mdash;which are not, after all, wholly irrelevant to the subject&amp;mdash; without giving them the excessive emphasis of placing their individual listings on the same level as the wikibook's table of contents.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 10:46, 6 June 2012 (UTC)
::::Very well, I understand and it sounds reasonable. Thank you for your time. [[User:TheZelos|TheZelos]] ([[User talk:TheZelos|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TheZelos|contribs]]) 11:05, 6 June 2012 (UTC)

== thank you for the welcome and other stuff ==

are my wikibooks appropraite? --[[User:Hexkc245|Hexkc245]] ([[User talk:Hexkc245|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Hexkc245|contribs]]) 01:22, 2 December 2012 (UTC)

: Well, there isn't much to them, yet.  A book is a large thing, made up of a number of pages.  You should have a notion, when you start a book, of what its approach to its subject will be, and probably about what its table of contents will look like.  I'm not sure [[John Cena]] has the potential to be developed into a book.  (A whole book about this one person?)  A book about Germany seems quite possible, but you should think about what kind of stuff you want in it, etc.  And a book about Portland, Maine may be more challenging, but again, it seems possible if you work out how you want to approach the subject.

: Take a look at our book '''[[Using Wikibooks]]'''.  It's both an example of a complete book, and has a section about creating a new book.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 01:32, 2 December 2012 (UTC)

== Help on the Geometry Book ==

Regarding your edits, it would be helpful to add a navigation panel, but I don't wanna start an edit war. So could we reach a consensus on this? (And by the way, I'm also studying off of this, so...)[[User:FlashingYoshi|FlashingYoshi]] ([[User talk:FlashingYoshi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/FlashingYoshi|contribs]]) 00:01, 6 December 2012 (UTC)
EDIT: Also, thanks for welcoming, but I'm from Wikipedia, so...

: Hm.  I hadn't thought the thing I'd seen there was going to be useful.  How to do navigation templates is something of a puzzle; I'm not sure there's any one way of doing it that really works well from all points of view.  Perhaps look around some, see some styles, and judge what you'd like most?  You could even ask for suggestions at the reading room.  I tried something I was hoping would work well on '''[[Conlang]]''', but that too has weaknesses, and I always meant to further improve the tools for it but was distracted by other things.

: (I'm not exactly sure what being from Wikipedia has to do with being welcomed; but, as may be.&amp;nbsp;:-)&amp;nbsp; --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 00:06, 6 December 2012 (UTC)

:: It's just that Í edit on many different projects, so I'm kinda getting tired of being welcomed at every single project. Regarding your suggestion, I might just do a simple &quot;Back&quot; button. But the page has a Print version, so how can I keep the TOC and &lt;==Front/Back==&gt; buttons off of the printed? I'm trying the Acoustics book method, but still keeping the TOC for now on the pages that contain them. [[User:FlashingYoshi|FlashingYoshi]] ([[User talk:FlashingYoshi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/FlashingYoshi|contribs]]) 00:14, 6 December 2012 (UTC)

::: Not to put too fine a point on it, every project is different from all the others.  One of the functions of those welcome messages is to give contributors a guide to what about that sister is different.  If you aren't reading the welcome messages, you're missing stuff.  Myself, I've never gotten past contributing to three sisters because I found that it was so much work to learn enough about each new project, so as to do justice to it when contributing, that once I'd learned three of them I just couldn't afford the effort to learn a fourth.

::: If by &quot;print version&quot; of a book, you mean a page called &quot;''bookname''/Print&amp;nbsp;version&quot; that transcludes all the pages of the book, you can configure a navigation template to suppress itself when transcluded onto a page that ends with &quot;Print&amp;nbsp;version&quot;.  You'd put a condition around the whole content of the template, something like this (writing this off the cuff):
:::: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{#ifeq:{{SUBPAGENAME}}|Print version|| ... content when not the print version ... }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

*If our relationship with this supplier had been discontinued, we would have had difficulty achieving our goals.
*It would have been difficult for us to replace this supplier.
*We were quite dependent on this supplier.
*We did not have a good alternative to this supplier.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:UVa Rotunda.jpg|thumb|196px|right|The Rotunda at The University of Virginia]]

''Lentis: The Social Interface of Technology'' is a guidebook to the realm where technological phenomena and social phenomena intersect.  If we think of technology and society as circular domains that overlap, the common domain they share is a lens in shape.  Hence the short title of the book, ''Lentis,'' which is Latin for &quot;of [or about] the lens.&quot;  If the title (with its association with lenses) also suggests means of viewing, of examining, of magnifying, and of discovering, so much the better.  The lens-shaped realm is called the &quot;social interface of technology.&quot;

The chief authors of ''Lentis'' are students at the [http://www.seas.virginia.edu/ University of Virginia's School of Engineering and Applied Science]: &quot;STS [[http://www.sts.virginia.edu/ Science, Technology and Society]] and Engineering Practice.&quot;  As a wikibook, ''Lentis'' will accept contributions from authors and editors all over the world, but the student authors will take particular responsibility to produce a complete, well documented, well written and useful book.  Until December 16, 2013, would-be contributors who are not students in the class are asked to edit sparingly—but are also invited to comment freely on discussion pages, where their suggestions and advice will be welcomed and appreciated.

''Lentis'' is intended to serve a general purpose and a specific purpose.  The general purpose is to present to interested readers worldwide illuminating cases with practical lessons for those who navigate the dangerous channels of the social interface of technology.  The book begins with the premise that success in technological and social endeavors often depends upon the skillful negotiation of sociotechnical factors, where technological techniques alone, or social techniques alone, are insufficient.  A second premise is that case studies offer generalizable lessons that can guide people who work where technology and society overlap.  They are, in effect, &quot;true fables&quot; that offer &quot;morals&quot; of practical value in diverse endeavors.

More specifically, ''Lentis'' is a book written by and for [[w:Engineers|engineers]].  Here the premise is that engineers by definition are problem solvers whose work ultimately serves non-engineers, and who must therefore inevitably venture into the social interface of technology, where these non-engineers dwell.  Too often, engineers have had to leave this territory to managers, policy makers, clients and others who lack the technical expertise for success in this zone.  If engineers can develop the social expertise they need at the social interface of technology, they can lead there.

If &quot;those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,&quot; then those who recover the past can best lead us out of it.  The history of technology has no shortage of cases of technological innovations that succeeded until they met the social interface, where social phenomena interact with technological phenomena in surprising ways.  This book will be a success if it helps engineers anticipate these effects.

Most of the chapters in ''Lentis'' are examinations of cases.  The authors will attempt to derive practical lessons from these cases; the most valuable lessons will be generalizable.  If a lesson is generalizable, it is applicable in cases and situations that may be far removed in time, space or engineering field.  A case from American transportation engineering in the 1990s, for example, may have lessons useful to biomedical engineers in 2014.  The authors have endeavored to find such lessons in the cases they investigated.  Because social theories are also useful navigational aids in the social interface of technology, some chapters examine such theories.  The authors have sought not only to explain such theories, but to show how they can be of practical value.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== FTDI  driver installation for microcontroller board ==


'''Intro'''

The USB interface between the robot’s PC or laptop an the microcontroller board has sometimes been difficult to get working correctly.  Recently,  FTDI (ftdichip.com), the manufacturer of the USB chip installed on the USB module on the microcontroller board, has come out with a new driver installation method using a simple setup.exe program.  

I’ve tried this program on Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7 (32 and 64 bit versions) with success, so I’m going to use that method below.  If it ever fails to install properly, let me know and we’ll try the good old problematic installation methods.


'''Prerequisites'''

The only  hardware required is  the DLP-USB245M module installed on the microcontroller board,  the USB cable, and the PC or laptop with USB ports (1.0 or 2.0)

We are using the latest version of the driver  from the chip manufacturer.  See ftdichip.com/FTDrivers.htm  Note that there are two types of driver interfaces available.  A Virtual Com Port (VCP) which appears to the PC software exactly like a com port but without baudrate limitations.  And a direct driver (D2XX) which the PC interfaces with through a DLL.  The NavAndControl.exe software in the Leaf PC uses the D2XX interface.

So, step 1 is to get the latest driver.  You will find on page ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm that they have a single driver, called the “Combined Driver Model” which supports both the VCP interface and the DLL.  This driver is currently (as of 8/28/10) version 2.08.02 which is available as a zip file or as a setup exe.  We’ll be using the setup.exe

This driver installation supports Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7 in both 32 and 64 bit versions.  As far as I know,  this driver (or previous versions) has been installed in Windows XP and Vista 32 bit versions and in Windows 7 in 32 and 64bit versions.
Installation varies slightly between Windows versions, so sections are provided below for each version.


'''Windows XP  or Vista'''

	The following was tested on a newly installed version of XP (32 bit) with SP3 installed and on a machine running Vista with SP2.  I found no instructions for using this setup, so I did it as follows:

	Don’t plug in the USB cable yet (to avoid potential automatic installation of an incorrect driver.)

	Download the Setup.exe  referred to above from http://ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm
I always Save rather than Run so I have a copy for later use.  Save it anywhere you want to keep it.
Note, it downloads as “CDM20802_Setup.exe”.

	Run the file by double clicking on it.
	A console window comes up saying “32 bit OS detected”  and automatically installs and closes.  This usually takes just a couple seconds.  (Once I had it hang up in the install phase.  I closed the window and restarted the program and it completed normally.)

	Plug in the USB cable (the microcontroller board does not need to be powered since the DLP-USB module is powered from the USB cable.  However, the module must be plugged onto the microcontroller board since there are connections that have to be made.)

	The “Found New Hardware” popup appeared.  After a minute or so, it changed to “your new hardware is installed and ready to use” (or “your new device…”).

	If it doesn’t say your new hardware is installed and ready to use, go to '''Troubleshooting Driver''' below.

	Otherwise, continue to '''Testing Interface''' below.


'''Windows 7'''  (32 and 64 bit versions)

	First time the microcontroller board was connected to the Windows 7 machine,  the “Installing Device Driver Software” window came up followed quickly by  “Device Driver software installed successfully”

Drivers show up in Device manager as USB Serial Port in Ports, and as USB Serial Converter in Universal Serial Bus Controllers.

	The  Driver is:  FTDI  Version  2.8.2.0 which is the latest version as of 8/28/10

	I can’t say for sure whether the drivers are preinstalled in Windows 7 or they were downloaded automatically from the internet.  

	If the above doesn’t work on your machine, I assume you can download the setup.exe version of this driver and install as described above for XP.  If you don’t have internet access, you can download setup.exe on any computer with access and copy it to your robot computer.

	If it doesn’t say your new hardware is installed and ready to use, go to '''Troubleshooting Driver''' below.

	Otherwise, continue to '''Testing Interface''' below.

''Hmmm, before attempting the following test using NavAndControl, be aware that I just tried running NavAndControl on my Windows 7 machine and it wouldn’t start.  I’m SURE I had it working before.  However,  the LeafUSBtest.exe program referred to elsewhere for troubleshooting did run successfully on both the 32 and 64 bit machines, so the USB interface is working.''
		


'''Testing Interface'''

	At this point, the drivers are installed you should be able to test the interface by installing the Leaf runtime version of code into the microcontroller (if not already done) and run NavAndControl.exe from the Leaf folder as described in the software installation instructions.

	Make sure the microcontroller  Run/Prog switch is in the Run position and the microcontroller board is powered.  Press the reset button on the microcontroller Adapt  board.

	You will initially see a red annunciator window in the upper left corner of the NavAndControl window which says “Micro Inactive”.  The Window should turn amber within a few seconds and say “Micro Active” if everything is working.  Otherwise it will remain red.  If red, continue with the troubleshooting tips below.  It is possible, but unlikely, that the annunciator will turn green after a while  and say “Micro Ready”.  This would mean that the yaw rate gyro is all set up and calibrated.   The “Micro active” state is adequate for all basic operation.

	So, if you got Micro Active or Ready,  you have successfully installed the drivers.  If not, continue with Troubleshooting Interface below.


'''Troubleshooting Driver:'''

	Try another USB cable.

There are driver installation instructions available at http://ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/InstallGuides.htm  in case my instructions don’t work.  These guides have directions for installing as well as troubleshooting instructions.

If you don’t have any luck with these, ask for help on the mail list.

	You can do further verification that the driver is correct with the following:

	You can verify that both the VCP and D2XX interfaces are installed by going to device manager and checking that USB Serial port COM4 is listed in PORTS and USB Serial converter is listed in Universal Serial Bus Controllers

	If you want to be sure that the two references above are your microcontroller module (and not something else you have installed that looks similar), you can either disconnect the cable and see that both references disappear; or you can double click each reference in device manager, look at the “Details” tab and see that the device is VID 0403  &amp; PID 6001 which is the identication of this specific module chip.

	Another check you can make that the laptop is talking to the USB module properly is to download a small utility program called “Microsoft usbview.exe” from  http://ftdichip.com/Support/Utilities.htm

Run this program and you should see an entry called “USB serial converter”.  Double click this entry and you will see a list of parameters for this device which should include that it is a DLP-USB245M.  


'''Troubleshooting Interface:'''

	If the interface does not appear to be working with NavAndControl,  you can run a simpler test to just verify the usb interface.  There is a test program called “LeafUSBtest.exe” located on the website under software utilities and/or on the mail list files section..
You just attach the USB cable from the PC to the microcontroller AND apply power to the micro. I'm assuming that the usual runtime software is installed on the micro and the micro is set to run when power is applied. 
Then run the program from any location. It puts up a simple console window which will do two things. 
It enumerates the USB devices on your PC that have interface chips manufactured by FTDI (ftdichip.com). This should include the chip on the USB module which you have plugged into the microcontroller board as well as any others, for example, you may have some in common USB serial converter cables. So, it gives you the number of such chips found, and the descriptions of those chips. It is looking for a chip whose description is &quot;DLP-USB245M&quot; (which most people have) or &quot;D2XX Recover PID for XP&quot; which is an old version but some people may still have it. 
Having found the correct chip it will initialize it and return and error code of zero (printed on the screen).  If successful. It then transmits all the numbers from 1 to 256 down to the micro which echos them back to the screen. This proves the 8 bit parallel interface to the microcontroller is all working in both directions. It will then report success or failure. 


	There are several pins that must be wired together on the microcontroller board.  To check the connection of the USB module to the microcontroller board,  verify that the USB module has 5 vdc on pins 3, 10, 11 and 12.  This test must be done with the USB cable installed and the laptop powered up.  If not, check your soldering of those pins on the micro board and/or verify continuity between all those pins with an ohmmeter.  These pins are sufficient to install the driver, but there are additional pins required to transfer data which the LeafUSBtest.exe program can verify.  These pins alone should allow the LeafUSBtest program to at least talk to the USB module even if it can’t send microcontroller data back and forth.


If you install using the Setup.exe, it will automatically move FTD2xx.dll to  the Windows/system32 folder. Verify that it is there.  It should have a date the same as the setup.exe file (7/12/2010 for ver 2.08.02)



Notes:

	The USB module on the microcontroller board is the DLP-USB245M which is available from digikey.com as their part number 813-1019-ND.

	The cable is a standard USB cable with a type A connector on one end and a B on the other.

	Any PC USB port should work.  (but it never hurts to try another if one doesn’t work)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Characteristic features of PostgreSQL ==
* You can define your own types. Just as with tables, types consist of a collection of named attributes so you could define an &quot;employee&quot; type consisting of a text name, an integer employee number and a decimal salary. Unlike tables, you also define input and output functions so that values of your new type can be read and written. It makes sense to ensure that the input function can interpret the values as represented by the output function so that your application can read its own handwriting, but that is not a formal requirement.
* Inheritance is supported. Suppose you have a table of employees, none of whom currently earn commission. You want to add data about sales representatives to your table, and they will need a commission column. If you add a commission column to your existing employees table, it will always contain NULL in almost every row. Alternatively, you could create a new table just for the sales representatives. It inherits all the columns from the employees table and adds a commission column. PostgreSQL keeps track of the inheritance so you can query all employees (including sales reps), just the standard employees, or just the reps.
* You can extend it with new functions (including aggregates) and operators. In fact this is essential if you want to support any new types you create beyond simply inputting, storing and retrieving them. User-defined functions are also required if you create your own indexing scheme, another possible consequence of creating new data types.

== History of PostgreSQL ==
* Originated from the Ingres project.
* Post-Ingres project was an attempt to improve the type system.

== Installing ==
=== Installing from packages ===

=== Installing from source ===

== Starting and stopping ==
&lt;pre&gt;
$ /etc/init.d/postgresql start
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Creating a user ==
The following command creates a new user with superuser privileges:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ createuser -U postgres -s &lt;some username&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Creating a new user is a database operation, so it can only be done by an existing database user. You need to specify which database user to use (otherwise it will default to using a database user with the same name as your current UNIX user, which is unlikely to be correct). Default installs typically have a user called &lt;tt&gt;postgres&lt;/tt&gt; that can be used for this.

To set a password for the newly created user, log in to the database using an account with superuser privileges, and issue the command:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
ALTER USER &lt;username&gt; WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'secret';
&lt;/source&gt;

== Explanation of Derivation ==

The section &quot;arranged by culture&quot; on the Wikipedia page [[w:List_of_numeral_system_topics | List of numeral system topics]] gives a feel for the different counting systems different cultures have come up with.  A little practice doing calculations with other ancient number systems like the [[w:Roman_numerals | Roman numerals]] will show the advantages of [[w:Arabic_numbers | Hindu-Arabic numerals]].  Mathematics before the introduction of Hindu-Arabic numerals and our notation for variables was expressed very differently.  Much of the history of math is the story of extending existing notations or creating new notations to express mathematical ideas.  The history section on the Wikipedia page [[w:Quadratic_equation#History |Quadratic equations]] shows that methods like the one described below were known as early as 2,000 BC, and were still being published in journals as let as 1896.  

The method for completing the square started with a geometric representation, but is even more powerful for transforming equations symbolically.  With practice you will find it easy to use for solving and graphing quadratic functions, but it is also necessary for transforming equations in later mathematics classes you will take.  


[[Image:Completing_the_square_307.PNG|left|Completing The Square]] 
:In this drawing we've divided area a into unit squares that are .  The &lt;math&gt;x^2 &lt;/math&gt; term groups these units into the largest square possible while the &lt;math&gt;{b}x&lt;/math&gt; term represents the remaining units to get to a.  For instance if a=40 then x=6 and b=4/6 or if a=44 then x=6 and b= 8/6.



:Divide the term in front of the ''x'' in half. 


:And create two strips on the side of your square.


Multiply this back out to convince yourself that this works.

4. Therefore the ''completed square'' form of the quadratic is:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{y}{a} + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = \left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + \frac{c}{a} &lt;/math&gt; or, multiplying through by a,

== Example ==

The best way to learn to complete a square is through an example. Suppose you want to solve the following equation for x.

{|
| 2x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 24x + 23 = 0 || Does not factor easily, so we complete the square.
|-
|x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 12x + 23/2 = 0 || Make coefficient of x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; a 1, by dividing all terms by 2.
|-
|x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 12x = - 23/2 || Add – 23/2 to both sides.    
|-
|x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 12x + 36 = - 23/2 + 36 || Take half of 12 (coefficient of x), and square it. Add to both sides.
|-
|(x + 6)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 49/2 || Factor. Now we can take square roots to easily solve this form of the equation.
|-
| √(x + 6)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = √49/√2 || Take the  square root.
|-
|x + 6 =  7/√2 || Simplify. 
|-
|x = -6 + (7√2)/2 || Rationalize the denominator.
|}

== Derivation ==

The purpose of &quot;completing the square&quot; is to either factor a prime quadratic equation or to more easily graph a parabola. The procedure to follow is as follows for a quadratic equation &lt;math&gt; y = ax^2+bx+c &lt;/math&gt;:

1. Divide everything by ''a'', so that the number in front of &lt;math&gt; x^2 &lt;/math&gt; is a perfect square (1):
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{y}{a} = x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{c}{a} &lt;/math&gt;

2. Now we want to focus on the term in front of the ''x''. Add the quantity &lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 &lt;/math&gt; to both sides:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{y}{a} + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x +\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + \frac{c}{a} &lt;/math&gt;

3. Now notice that on the right, the first three terms factor into a perfect square:
:&lt;math&gt; x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x +\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = \left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Multiply this back out to convince yourself that this works.

4. Therefore the ''completed square'' form of the quadratic is:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{y}{a} + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = \left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + \frac{c}{a} &lt;/math&gt; or, multiplying through by a,

&lt;math&gt; y = a\left(x+\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + c - \frac{b^2}{4a} &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">;Syntax:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
    typeid( object );
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;'''typeid'''&lt;/code&gt; operator, used to determine the class of an object at runtime. It returns a reference to a &lt;code&gt;std::type_info&lt;/code&gt; object, which exists until the end of the program, that describes the &quot;object&quot;. If the &quot;object&quot; is a dereferenced null pointer, then the operation will throw a &lt;code&gt;std::bad_typeid&lt;/code&gt; exception.

Objects of class &lt;code&gt;std::bad_typeid&lt;/code&gt; are derived from &lt;code&gt;std::exception&lt;/code&gt;, and thrown by &lt;code&gt;'''typeid'''&lt;/code&gt; and others.

{{NOTE|The C++98 standard requires that header file ''&lt;typeinfo&gt;'' to be included before operator &lt;code&gt;'''typeid'''&lt;/code&gt; is used within a compilation unit. Otherwise, the program is considered ill-formed.}}

The use of &lt;code&gt;typeid&lt;/code&gt; is often preferred over {{C++ Programming/kw|dynamic_cast}}&lt;code&gt;&lt;''class_type''&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in situations where just the class information is needed, because &lt;code&gt;typeid&lt;/code&gt;, applied on a type or non de-referenced value is a [[w:Constant time|constant-time]] procedure, whereas {{C++ Programming/kw|dynamic_cast}} must traverse the class derivation lattice of its argument at runtime. However, you should never rely on the exact content, like for example returned by &lt;code&gt;std::type_info::name()&lt;/code&gt;, as this is implementation specific with respect to the compile.

It is generally only useful to use &lt;code&gt;'''typeid'''&lt;/code&gt; on the dereference of a pointer or reference (i.e. &lt;code&gt;typeid(*ptr)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;typeid(ref)&lt;/code&gt;) to an object of polymorphic class type (a class with at least one [[C++ Programming/Classes#Virtual member functions|virtual member function]]). This is because these are the only expressions that are associated with run-time type information. The type of any other expression is statically known at compile time.

;Example
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;typeinfo&gt;  //for 'typeid' to work

class Person {
public:
   // ... Person members ...
   virtual ~Person() {}
};

class Employee : public Person {
   // ... Employee members ...
};

int main () {
   Person person;
   Employee employee;
   Person *ptr = &amp;employee;
   // The string returned by typeid::name is implementation-defined
   std::cout &lt;&lt; typeid(person).name() &lt;&lt; std::endl;   // Person (statically known at compile-time)
   std::cout &lt;&lt; typeid(employee).name() &lt;&lt; std::endl; // Employee (statically known at compile-time)
   std::cout &lt;&lt; typeid(ptr).name() &lt;&lt; std::endl;      // Person * (statically known at compile-time)
   std::cout &lt;&lt; typeid(*ptr).name() &lt;&lt; std::endl;     // Employee (looked up dynamically at run-time
                                                      //           because it is the dereference of a
                                                      //           pointer to a polymorphic class)
}

&lt;/source&gt;
Output (exact output varies by system):

&lt;code&gt;
 Person
 Employee
 Person*
 Employee
&lt;/code&gt;

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you have questions, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(This is not an automated message, I'll be watching during a time for any reply you make to it...)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:43, 29 August 2010 (UTC)

== [[Wikistution]] ==

Please put this at [[v:|Wikiversity]] instead.  It is not a textbook in line with [[WB:WIW|our scope]].  Wikiversity allows class projects of that sort where experiments are performed.  We do not allow [[WB:OR|original research]].  &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 16:43, 15 October 2010 (UTC)

Hi Adrignola - I think my use of the word &quot;experiment&quot; in my introductory section was misleading, and I'm afraid this wikibook won't fit in well with wikiversity.  I don't want to move it there only to have editors ask me to move it to wikibooks.  It is not a class or instructional project (though students and classes are welcome to use it).  This wikibook is not original research; no one is looking for new facts, findings or interpretations.  It is experimental only in the very loose sense in which collaborative anonymous worldwide editing is inherently experimental.  I chose it for wikibooks because it's not for a class and it's in line with the &quot;annotated texts&quot; that wikibooks invites.  Unlike most annotated texts, in this case editors ''can'' change the original text itself. This makes it unusual as an annotated text, but I'd like to ask for some room for this innovation under the principle laid down under &quot;Annotated Texts&quot; that &quot;There are no absolute rules for texts of this kind [ie annotated texts] and any reasonable decision by the contributor(s) should be respected.&quot;  Thank you!  [[User:Norton|Norton]] ([[User talk:Norton|talk]]) 17:42, 15 October 2010 (UTC)

:I will confer with a user here who heavily participates here and at Wikiversity to see what he thinks of the project.  One thing that still concerns me is that it may conflict with point # 1 [[Wikibooks:WIW#Wikibooks_is_not_a_mirror_or_a_text_repository|in this section]], that &quot;Wikibooks does not allow original fiction or literature&quot;.  &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 17:21, 15 October 2010 (UTC)

:Thank you, Adrignola! (And I can assure you that this wikibook is in no sense fiction or literature.)  [[User:Norton|Norton]] ([[User talk:Norton|talk]]) 17:42, 15 October 2010 (UTC)

Wikiversity has [[v:Great Repeal Bill|Great Repeal Bill]] which was started by two Members of British Parliament and has had some media coverage. Its an experiment in which the general public collaborate to help rewrite British law with the aim that those two Members of British Parliament hope to present the proposed changes to the full Parliament for adoption as law. I realize that isn't quiet what you are doing, but I think its a good example of the type of things Wikiversity allows which aren't exactly &quot;for a class&quot; or an &quot;instruction project&quot;. Books at Wikibooks are intended to be useful by teachers and students in a class, but can also be useful for self-learning. Wikiversity compliments Wikibooks by providing a place for other works that might be useful in a class, but aren't strictly so either. I invite you to open discussion at [[v:Wikiversity:Colloquium|Colloquium]] to obtain feedback, if you still have doubts on whether your experimental constitution would be welcome at Wikiversity.

While there are no rules on ''how to'' annotate texts, I believe the intentions is to only include annotations of works which have been previously published and might be discussed in a literary class, such as the works of Shakespeare. In this sense Wikibooks' scope overlaps with Wikisource. Wikisource includes previously published works which are in the public domain or have been released under a license compatible with CC-BY-SA, and annotations of those works. If you wanted to just annotate the American Constitution this would be a different conversation. I have seen occasions at Wikibooks where there was potential to push the envelope by including works that might bind Wikibooks' inclusion policies some before, but I doubt this would be considered acceptable at Wikibooks if presented for discussion in the reading room, or others would suggest moving to Wikiversity as well if nominated for deletion. Wikiversity itself is considered an experiment in using wiki technology for collaborative learning, which I believe to be more in line with what you want to do than what Wikibooks is meant for. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:00, 15 October 2010 (UTC)

:Darklama, I appreciate your advice very much; thank you for taking the time.  I do want the best fit for this project.  I may take you up on your suggestion to put this to discussion at the colloquium, because as a person interested in selecting the most appropriate venue for this project, I reviewed the scopes for Wikiversity and for Wikibooks; it seemed pretty clear from them that a non-instructional text not associated with a class project or an educational mission is a stretch for Wikiversity.  I don't want to move there if editors there tell me it's not in their scope.  On the other hand a source text with no class- or school-related purpose, inviting annotations (and in this case editing as well) seems to be a better fit at Wikibooks, given the quite inclusive guidelines for annotated texts (&quot;There are no absolute rules for texts of this kind [ie annotated texts] and any reasonable decision by the contributor(s) should be respected.&quot;)  It seems to me that the guidelines, especially under &quot;Annotated Texts,&quot; would need some rewriting if wikibooks is to avoid more projects such as this one.  Other Wikibookians' thoughts may help.  Thanks, — [[User:Norton|Norton]] ([[User talk:Norton|talk]]) 23:26, 15 October 2010 (UTC)

:: If you are suggesting that this work is not educational that would actually put it outside the scope of all Wikimedia projects. However I believe your experiment is educational, just more suited within Wikiversity's scope than Wikibooks' scope. What you want to do doesn't seem like a stretch of Wikiversity's scope to me. I believe your project would be considered an unreasonable use of Wikibooks though. Additionally annotations are notes made while reading information in a book. No existing book is being referred to since you are encouraging people to write there own constitution, which means it is not an annotation and those guidelines do not apply. However writing your own constitution is a learning opportunity and encouraging other people to participate in that learning makes it within Wikiversity's scope, while not within Wikibooks' scope. Your work encourages people to engage in learning while contributing to the work which is good for Wikiversity, but not good for Wikibooks because that involves engaging in the process of developing new and original ideas when Wikibooks is about educating people in what is already known. It is up to the Wikibooks community to decide whether the guidelines on Annotated Texts is in need of a rewrite, or when a work is reasonably an annotated text. Since the guidelines on annotated text is a somewhat young and hasn't presented much issues for Wikibooks yet there hasn't been much need to clarify, this may or may not present a reason to clarify. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 03:36, 16 October 2010 (UTC)

::: I agree it is educational, like presumably all wikibooks, and did not mean to suggest otherwise, but it's not associated with any particular educational mission, class, or school-related purpose; Wikiversity invites &quot;teachers, students, and researchers to join us in creating open educational resources and collaborative learning communities.&quot;  This is what makes me fear going through the same process at Wikiversity if this is moved there.  I see no suggestion in Wikiversity's scope that they accept an existing document (though of course they might), but an explicit statement to that effect in Wikibooks' scope.  The fact that this existing text can also be edited seemed to me to put it at the intersection of Wikibooks' categories of 1) existing texts and 2) editable new material associated with a subject field.  Since the original text is never lost, the line between annotation and editing is difficult to draw.  The new material on Wikistution I conceived as critique and commentary on the existing material, not as &quot;new and original ideas.&quot;  Yes, very clearly it's up to the Wikibooks community to decide whether the Annotated Text guidelines need a rewrite; for now the guidelines suggest existing texts for annotation are welcome under very broad parameters; indeed the wording seems to encourage some innovation.  But I fear I'm giving the wrong impression here.  I ''absolutely'' do not have ''any'' wish at all to try to push Wikistution here if it doesn't belong here.  I will happily agree to a move to Wikiversity if it is indeed appear to be Wikibookians' consensus that this book does not belong here, and Wikiversitians' consensus that the book does belong there.  For this reason I hope another Wikibookian or two will comment, and meanwhile I'll seek advice at Wikiversity.  - [[User:Norton|Norton]] ([[User talk:Norton|talk]]) 09:04, 16 October 2010 (UTC)

:::: Wikiversity doesn't restrict itself to any sort of traditional meaning of teacher, student, or researcher. A teacher is anyone that wishes to teach. A student is anyone that wishes to learn. A researcher is anyone that wishes to research. People may participate at Wikiversity in any number of roles. See [[v:Wikiversity:Who are Wikiversity participants?|Wikiversity:Who are Wikiversity participants?]]. Yes some innovation is encouraged in annotating texts. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]] is presumably an example of that. For Wikistution to work at Wikibooks, the United States Constitution would need to be preserved as a static text with only notes added, removed, edited and changed. I believe the most that would be considered reasonable would be to update the wording of the United States Constitution using modern English language, but that would need to preserve and be a reasonable proximity of the original meaning. In the notes you could refer to changes to parts of the US Constitutions that other people have suggested and published in some form, but all in all you would not be able to propose changes you would like to see to the US Constitution yourself unless you do that at Wikiversity. You can even provide an analysis of the US Constitution in the notes, but they need to reflect published sources, unless you do that at Wikiversity. If anyone questions the validity of an analysis or suggested change it would need to be removed unless a published source can be found. I hope you get the drift of where the line in general is. This could even be a cross-wiki collaboration project with parts done at Wikibooks and parts done at Wikiversity depending on what is wanted. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 10:21, 16 October 2010 (UTC)

::::: I'm certainly persuaded that Wikistution might be be best suited to Wikiversity, and without repeating myself I'll add that under the written scope of Wikibooks, Wikistution might be best suited to Wikibooks.  I have your position on this, Darklama, which I appreciate.  I am now seeking advice at Wikiversity, and I hope to get the view of another Wikibookian or two.  My only goal is to find the best place for Wikistution.  - [[User:Norton|Norton]] ([[User talk:Norton|talk]]) 13:02, 16 October 2010 (UTC)

:::::: My intent isn't to persuade you, rather to provide you with information so you can find the wiki best suited for what you want to do. In that regard our goal is the same. I'm most likely the user Adrignola said he would confer with, since he left me a message about this on my talk page and hasn't contributing to this discussion since than. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:55, 16 October 2010 (UTC)

::::::: I thought you wanted to do more than inform me of your interpretation of Wikibooks' written scope, but also to persuade me that it is the more valid interpretation.  And I'm open minded and prepared to be persuaded.  Since Wikibooks' annotated texts guideline is, as you said, &quot;young&quot; and still evolving, its precise limits are unclear (as the guideline notes), despite its general call to defer to good-faith contributors on such judgments.  I think at this point we need another Wikibookian's interpretation.  Meanwhile, several hours ago I posted an inquiry on Wikiversity's colloquium about the suitability of Wikistution for Wikiversity.  If the consensus here is that Wikistution is ill suited to Wikibooks, and the consensus at Wikiversity is that it is well suited to Wikiversity, I'll be entirely in favor of a move to Wikiversity.  So far there have been no comments at Wikiversity, and no other Wikibookians' views (besides ours and Adrignola's) have been presented here.  So I suggest we suspend this matter for a few days, or until we have some more suggestions.  I'm sure this will reach a conclusion satisfactory to us all, since we all agree that we all want the best place for Wikistution.  - [[User:Norton|Norton]] ([[User talk:Norton|talk]]) 16:26, 16 October 2010 (UTC)

:::::::: I wanted to give you some perspective both from Wikibooks side of things and the Wikiversity side of things, so you could make an informed decision of where you want to go from here. I generally assume that I have no ability to persuade anyone to do anything, and try to focus on being informative instead. I also assume that most people don't need to be persuaded, but rather just need information. Your interpretation could easily be just as valid as any other interpretation. I usually try to avoid making judgments, and prefer to ask questions instead when I can think of any. For me this has just been about giving you another perspective in addition to Adrignola's so that you got more to work with and can better decide what to do next. It is the individual wiki communities that decide what is valid or not, I'm just one voice. Adrignola apparently thought my input was worth something, but I wouldn't assume that you would feel the same because you don't know me and the worth of anyone's input varies. That was probably more than what was necessary to understand my personal philosophy. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:09, 16 October 2010 (UTC)

::::::::: Thank you, Darklama.  In the spirit you suggest, I'm gathering information.  I do think your input is valuable, and you've helped me appreciate the breadth of Wikiversity's scope, for which I am indebted to you.  When I have sufficient information for a decision, or when a community consensus becomes more evident, I'll take the appropriate course.  I remain entirely open to a move to Wikiversity, if and when such a move appears to be in the best interests of both communities.  So far you have been my best source of information.  I'll give it a little more time so that I can get a somewhat clearer sense of the two communities' views.  Appreciatively, - [[User:Norton|Norton]] ([[User talk:Norton|talk]]) 20:54, 16 October 2010 (UTC)

Darklama was indeed the person whose input I desired.  I've solicited additional input in the [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Projects#Wikistution|projects reading room]].  You should monitor that page in case anyone responds there rather than here. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 16:55, 16 October 2010 (UTC)

== [[Professionalism]] ==

101 students?  I'm glad you're able to manage them all.  I'm especially glad that you like Wikibooks as a platform so much that you're starting a second book here with a class.  If Wikibooks can help you and your students learn, achieve goals, and produce a product that you can be proud of, I'm all for it.  We recently redid our help pages at [[Help:Contents]], so if any of your students are new to wiki formatting and editing, that'd be a good place to direct them to.  Let me know if there are any questions, concerns, or problems. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 02:43, 4 March 2011 (UTC)
:Thank you for your words of welcome, Adrignola.  (And to be honest, I don't know if I ''can'' manage 101 students!)  Since day one of my use of Wikibooks, your help has been generous and indispensable.  Yes, I do like Wikibooks as a platform, a fact which I attribute to 1) my students (whose feedback about their experience has been emphatically positive) and 2) to helpful Wikibookians (above all you).  I'm glad to know of the revised help page, to which I will refer the authors (though most of them are veterans from our first wikibook together last fall).  I appreciate your invitation to consult you. [[User:Norton|Norton]] ([[User talk:Norton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Norton|contribs]]) 16:14, 4 March 2011 (UTC)

==Ownership==
You cannot revert changes because &quot;this is a class assignment and the three main authors have to retain control over the content for now.&quot;. You, and no other editor, has &quot;control over the content&quot; as this is against Wikibooks policy. If you revert edits for this reason you may be blocked. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 00:28, 4 December 2011 (UTC)

I understand the predicament but unless the information is invalid or disputable please do not remove it. I have intentionally (because I understood the spirit of the contributions) avoided being more proactive over the content, that would not be the case if it wasn't a class project. This was already stated in my reply in [[Talk:Lentis/Mass Collaboration]]. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 02:59, 4 December 2011 (UTC)

:Hello Panic. I'm grateful to you for what you've had to offer and I hope you'll continue. I hope Wikibooks policy is not at issue, as I'm not telling you not to edit until this Thursday, I'm just asking you, as a request. This Wikibook would not exist but for these students' efforts, and so if the book has any value to Wikibooks, then the many fine editors who contribute to Wikibooks may find it worth their while to voluntarily limit content editing to formatting and corrections for four days. Such flexibility should pay off many times over, by encouraging instructors who create wikibooks to stay here. I think I and most instructors will never ask (and I do mean ''ask'') for more than modest accommodations, such as limited postponements of content edits. With such accommodations, I and other instructors will be encouraged to contribute further to Wikibooks, to the benefit of everyone; without them we may feel have to look elsewhere. I chose Wikibooks 15 months ago because it welcomes class assignments and its helpful editors have so far been very willing to make accommodations to instructors' needs. In that spirit, would you be willing to hold off on further editing of Lentis chapters for 4-5 days? And would you mind if I deleted a couple of your latest edits--those the students ask me to delete? I'd be grateful. Thank you. [[User:Norton|Norton]] ([[User talk:Norton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Norton|contribs]]) 13:39, 4 December 2011 (UTC)

::Not a problem, but I ask the consideration that any removed meaningful content be restored if in the meantime it is not addressed but active editors. I also think that these pages would benefit from the use of a template that explains and limits in time the &quot;voluntarily restriction&quot; of outside editing, pointing to the relevant talk as a way address issues and permit the logging of any reversal. This would permit not only for other editors to understand the situation but provide the acknowledging of valid &quot;pending&quot; contributions (and a easy way for anyone to restore them later), it would also permit addressing other edits that may not be valid.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 20:22, 4 December 2011 (UTC)

:::Thank you, Panic! Your consideration is much appreciated. Your suggestions are very reasonable and I'll try to act on them. On the main page of Lentis, I wrote &quot;Until December 14, 2011, would-be contributors who are not students in the class are asked to edit sparingly—but are also invited to comment freely on discussion pages, where their suggestions and advice will be welcomed and appreciated.&quot; Obviously many editors would miss this request, and a template would be much harder to miss--I'll use one in the future (I need to figure out how to do it first), with an invitation to log edits on the talk page for later consideration. Thanks for these suggestions. [[User:Norton|Norton]] ([[User talk:Norton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Norton|contribs]]) 23:47, 4 December 2011 (UTC)

::::Of course if in the future you wish to prevent all outside (of the class project) edits you could just use your own userspace and place a notice on the top of the page stating that it is a class project (for people doing administration not block the edits that wouldn't be done by the owner), this somehow defeats the purpose of collaborative editing but would grantee editorial control. These pages could be later moved into the proper place (and would in any case by default of licensing be open for reutilization of content if they failed to be moved by the class project).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 00:11, 5 December 2011 (UTC)</text>

== Modeling a simple spaceship using Blender 2.49b ==
'''This is a simple tutorial on how to build a simple spaceship using blender 2.49b.''' One of the best things about blender is the adaptability that can be accessed through its user interface. This tutorial will give you a look at some of the included blender scripts. If you would like to make your own, however, you can refer to the scripting chapter of this wiki book. So now, I guess we can get started.

'''Step 1:''' First, open blender. You should get the default blender scene with the cube in the center. If you don't, try resetting your blender settings. Select the box in the center of the screen.

'''Step 2:''' Now we're going to shape the box into any shape we want. For now, we are going to shape it into a sort of triangle. If you want to use it as a box, that's fine, but I suggest following this tutorial using it as a sort-of triangle. To be able to modify it, in the lower buttons area (with stuff like Modifiers, Shapes, Multires, Mesh, and Link and Materials) you should see a drop-down menu that is currently on Object Mode. Change that to Edit Mode or hit the '''tab''' button. Now you will be able to modify different aspects of your box.

'''Step 3:''' With your box selected, hit Ctrl+Tab, and choose Faces. This allows you to modify the different faces. Faces are basically the different sides of your object, Edges are the edges of your object, and Vertices are points on your object where edges connect.

'''Step 4:''' Now, on your box, right click on one of the sides to select that side. If you want, first take a look around the box and then choose a side, but don't select the bottom or top face. To rotate around the box, hit the 8, 2, 4 or 6 button on your number pad, the one to the right of the arrow keys usually. Those buttons allow you to rotate around your objects and change your view. After you select the face you want, then rotate so that the face is facing towards you and looks like a square, and so that the grid around it looks like a flat horizontal line.

'''Step 5:''' There should be three arrows converging in the center of your face (or in the center of your box), and either the red or the green one should now be in the center of your face, and the other should be going off to the left or right, with the blue arrow going straight up or straight down. Use the 4 or 6 number pad button to rotate your view so you can see whichever arrow was in the center of your face, and left click mouse button on it, and hold the left click button, and drag the arrow around. Drag it until you have a rectangle.

http://i238.photobucket.com/albums/ff55/bryguy336/box.png

'''Step 6:''' Now to resize that face. With that face still selected, hit the S key, and move the mouse around. This should enable you to change the size of the face, and once you click, it should stop resizing and stay at that size. Experiment and get the hang of it, and then resize it so that it is an itsy bitsy teeny tiny box, and your rectangle more like a triangle. Congratulations! You have just made your first shape/object

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Chapter I: Settlement====

''Our interest in Chard [The Collins of Chard] revolves around its relationship with Tatworth Village - its sub-manor… a mere three miles down the road,… the distance walked by the population every Sunday - to attend it is nearest Church. The Devon Record’s Office of 1554, mentions Thatteworth as the land granted to William Petre… and goes on to describe it as: ‘the manor and park of Tatworthy’. Interestingly, in the early 1300s, the first warrant holder of the estate was a certain Adam Thatteworhe.''

This estate was typical of the period - for the most part engaged in farming and weaving… remaining in the Petre family for almost two hundred and fifty years, until 1790… the first hundred years being ‘The first age of England’s Renaissance’, The hamlet remained roughly the same size, just a collection of cottages, only increasing in size much later -  when the lace mills of Chard required labour, and then, later still, when Sparks &amp; Co., were manufacturing net at Holyrood Mill, in Perry Street, Tatworth. 
 
It is difficult to see the effects made by the battles and disturbances on Chard and it’s sub-manor during the Civil War. Land was taken away from some, divided by others, and sold on by widows and the bereaved. This part of England – the West Country, was a Parliamentary stronghold although naturally the high aristocracy sided with the king. What one can say is that things were never the same again, when the dust had died down… even though some of the holdings returned to their former owners, the population had been unsettled, and it took many years for the effects to be absorbed.

The workers of the land – the poor, were housed in cottages still owned by absentee landlords and by The Petre Estate. The destitute taken care of by The Church and local charities. All concerns provided by the Old Poor Law. Many of the poor were exempt from the Hearth Tax whilst receiving relief from charities. Couples preparing for marriage still had to seek permission from the rector of St Mary’s, Chard [Tatworth’s Parish Church] who in turn felt obliged to contacted Baron Petre, the main landowner. If the couple was likely to be homeless, they had to delay marriage, sometimes for years. The manor court could have undesirable couples shipped abroad to the colonies - as vagrants.  

The Settlement Law of 1662 required all persons to have a settled [home] parish. This had enormous implications where people lived and the pressure the lord of the manor exerted. Anyone moving from that parish to another could be sent back within a forty-day period. This time scale was later relaxed if the parish of settlement accepted the newcomer. A hundred and thirty years later the decision of settlement relied upon ‘when the person was chargeable’ - to the poor rates of the parish. Most poor families continued to be housed in family units. As a rural economy, the fluctuations in the market and the advent of bad harvests had a great impact on the society.

The many problems of housing the rural poor were obvious well before the Restoration, but the Settlement Laws of 1662, defined the people’s rights more acutely. The poor could be pushed out altogether and never fully established to form the necessary ‘right’ of Settlement. Poor families could be housed by taking over disused accommodation [squatting], take over a portion of an existing property, building on somebody else’s large garden, or a property could be sub-divided. Small freeholders could build their own or re-site an existing timber framed house. Tatworth was just a scattering of simple cottages built on marginal land alongside existing tracks. New dwellings that were built erected further from the centre on outlying parts of the settlement where community control was less strict... Once erected the squatter became accepted and later gained legal rights.

Many new builds were randomly placed to take full measure of the profit from corner plots, unused ground and land unfit for cultivation. Manorial lords profited by allowing new cottages on manorial waste in return for fines and quit rents. Over time these new incomers demanded their so-called rights to the common waste… if these rights were given then the cottage occupiers gained settlement as of right. The lord and his bailiff recognised that some of these newcomers did not have relatives or persons who could vouch for them and there were those who could not pay the rent in advance. It was therefore in the interests of the lord to see that work was provided even if it were work on the estate to repair roads, hedges, ditches and banks. In the next county Devon a survey records 21 percent of the poor were occupying church houses and that over half of the parishes housed the poor.

Ever since the Religious Houses were established part of their inheritance was looking after the poor by providing church and poor houses. These then became a valuable parish resource, which allowed flexibility to a slowly changing society. The birth rate in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries increased the separation of rural families, particularly those from small farms and smallholdings… slowly the poor migrated away from the land to the town and the new factories. The parish officials recognised that the cottagers and farm labourers were totally dependant on their wage especially as the wasteland grew scarce and their gardens shrunk. Self sufficiency for the poor was essential… there were two Elizabethan Statutes that insisted on a certain size of land that should go with the dwelling, and another accepted that squatters could build their own homes or that homes could be constructed by landlords for rent… these were The 1558/9 Acts. The housing of the poor has always been a problem, the responsibility ended up being a parish matter with the help of charities. This became what is now called local authority housing. In the latter end of the seventeenth century, there was a proliferation of habitation orders authorising the erection of cottages for the poor - the provision of rented accommodation.

The problems of the poor are always wrapped up with their relationship with the land - any pressure exerted on their ability to grow food, feed animals and provide a dwelling immediately have a knock on effect. The Enclosure Act was one such event that affected the poor more than anyone else. The object of ‘enclosure’ was to link manorial strips, and common-land ‘waste’, into economic areas - which could be easily contained; stocked, manured, drained and worked… this was obviously beneficial if the object was economic efficiency. Cooperative fairness, reasonableness, and for all the public’s good, it was certainly not. This Act worked in favour of the landowners both large and small. It enabled the less well off and the bereaved to be bought out over a long period.

The almshouse built on the ‘Lands of the Blessed Mary’ in 1471 on the north side of the High Street, Chard,  was renovated by the Corporation in 1647… built to house the community’s destitute and paupers. The Borough of Chard provided this group of terraced cottages. Thirteen years later The ‘Settlement and Removal’ Acts of the 1660s was designed to keep out anyone who was likely to be a burden on the rates. The Act tied men to their own parish for the next two centuries. Every parish had to list those who lived within the bounds. There were interminable arguments about the parish boundaries and those who were within and those without. Parish Officers did not have to make this list if they did not want to in fact it only affect any person who rented for under £10 per year and who was likely to be chargeable to their parish or to his parish of settlement – had come to inhabit. In the end, possession of a freehold or copyhold became a means of acquiring a settlement in the parish. Anyone applying for settlement had to live in it for forty days if he had a freehold or copyhold, rent for £10 per annum, serve in the parish office or pay taxes levied in the parish. In the end, it all became quite silly and the whole thing fizzled out mainly because no one could be bothered to go into all the various permutations. As long as people paid their taxes they could live in regulated accommodation [with planning permission] listed at the council offices.

In 1663 Richard Harvey who established a bequest, to the Borough of Chard, obtained premises. These properties were fitted out as a ‘Hospital’. All accomplished by 1698… included a farm for fresh produce and other lands called Chard Farm in Meldreth, Cambridgeshire. The second half of the eighteenth century saw the foundations laid for the country’s industrialization and the first agricultural revolution – a time of commercial activity organized to take note of the market place – concerning profit in a consumer society. Nearly fifty per-cent of the nation’s income was generated by agriculture. Enclosure was the destruction, leading to the disappearance, of an independent peasantry – the theft of ‘the people’s common rights’ affecting their fields, meadows and pastures. Enclosure led to evictions and oppression for the very poor, inarticulate, disabled and single parents over the centuries.

Towards the end of the eighteenth century, the result of enclosure became more apparent. The largest landowners who employed a land agent and farm manager were advantaged being able to increase their employer’s holdings… similarly, the farmer who owned more than fifty acres. The farsighted tenant farmers also increased their farm size by purchasing land for themselves. It was the small farmers with a large family who found themselves disadvantaged; they could not produce enough or buy new implements - to make the land profitable in bad times, as agriculture moved from subsistence to a commercial one.

The most substantial house in the parish is Parrocks Lodge built in the Regency neo-classical style at the time of George II, in 1801. Soon after it was built, John Deane moved in with his wife. Fifty years later the property was sold to Major John Churchill Landon. The Landon has had eleven children, which not only stimulated much energy to the hamlet and local aristocracy, although none married, keeping the family fortune well attended. The Langdon family stayed there for a hundred years eventually selling the place to the North family who took over a dilapidated estate.

Two paths, Parrocks Lane and Church Path [Chard Road], bisected the Tatworth Middle Field [one of the recorded open field systems]. In the centre lay William Drake’s Bean Land on Woodcock Gate, below which Parrocks House, Farmyard and Parkland sits. The present day Lodge and associated farm buildings are sited here. Over the parkland, boundary, and wall, were limekilns and pits owned by the original owners John Deane. When he died his partner Benjamin Coles took over the business and house.
Carboniferous Limestone is dry at the surface, and sends out springs at the base; its local soil is thin. It was discovered that by spreading crushed limestone onto arable soil improves texture and fertility. Lime is used in the building trade - for making mortar, lime-putty, daub and lime wash, and in the leather industry - for soaking animal skins - to remove hair. When baked in a kiln lime produces a caustic solid of calcium, and some magnesium, oxide. 

In the early to middle 1800s in Tatworth a large part of the male population worked on the land as farm workers – in times of need these worker turned their hand to all the other parts of the industry – hedging, ditching, horsemen, shepherds, stockmen, and foresters... the list is endless. There was a class division between these workers of the land and the tenant farmer, or smallholder. From a social point of view there was also a difference between the farm labourer who lived in Tatworth and a farmer who lived outside the parish – they were not considered part of the community. The business of farming is about working the land, which conferred a ridged social hierarchy. The people in the village knew who their gentry were, and who owned the land... They lived under, and worked within, their employer’s shadow.

Up to the time of The Great Exhibition in 1851, Tatworth had been considered a hamlet, this was prior to the chapel being built, about the same time the Langdon’s of Pattocks Lodge arrived in the now new village… to present an east and south window to the new chapel. Tatworth was raised to the status of ‘village’ when the chapel was built – and then higher still when the school was built twenty years later. Tatworth that year covered an area of 1552 acres and had a population of 852.

As with the rest of the country Tatworth went through many high and low employment cycles – these naturally conformed to average prosperity figures… National and civil wars, plagues and common ailments, clothing fashions and availability of natural resources, all contributed to population growth, economic and social wellbeing, and individual and group feel good factors. The Enclosure Act had a particular effect on rural life especially for the workers and those who lived off the land and forests. Before 1875, ‘High Farming’, was a term used to declare agricultural prosperity. It was at this time that rural emigration reached its peak. It is from that time that many hamlets and villages lost their viability – became deserted – the few who remained moved away.

At the turn of the century, the schoolchildren who knew each other viewed those from another district as suspect. There was a strong kinship between Tatworth villagers past and present, for as my mother explained, ‘what did they know or care how we lived and loved’. The happenings on the continent also influenced to a lesser or higher degree how manufacturing flourished, particularly those towns and villages within easy reach of the coast and trade routes. However, with all those influencing factors the two greatest disasters were the two world wars… the former, by loss of fathers and sons, the latter, the change wrought on the countryside and landowners – the breaking up of estates... this occurred during and just after: The Depression, The First World War, and later, by Government Legislation – Death Duties. Each changed Tatworth, radically.

Our story now moves on to the main characters. There was nothing outstanding about them as individuals. They were born in Chard, went to the church school, were formally introduced, as was the custom, courted, stocked their 'bottom drawer' and married. They set up house in Tatworth to be near the lace mill where Harry was to find work as a machine mechanic. When Harry and Rosa Collins took up residence in Rosalie Cottage, in 1891, Ivy Beviss moved in next door. This was a convenient arrangement for she was able to help-out when Rosa was confined the following year… and thereafter the family grew. As each year went by there was another mouth to feed. Ivy’s assistance became vital to the smooth running of the Collins’ household. There was never a lot of money in the household - things were tight. Clothing the children was always a problem. Either the eldest children’s clothes could not always be handed down because the next in line was not of the same sex, or they were still needed. To meet the problem there was a system of loans of necessary items from the 'lying-in' charity. These essential clothing items, including sheets and pillows, were kept by ‘lady-members, of the church for just such an instance, however, you had to apply for them and you had to be of good repute. Having to make this application put people off. Buying what was necessary at ‘the white elephant stall’ was judged a more acceptable way of coming by the needed item.

Harry Collins was a tall man, with regular features: a sloping forehead, fiery eyebrows and military moustache. Thinning grey-black hair swept back, gave him the looks of a firm schoolmaster, which his height reinforced. He was always dressed in black… a collar-less, thin striped-shirt under an open waistcoat… held together by his watch chain. His boots, which he was never seen without, were made of highly polished soft black leather. His weather beaten countenance friendly and warm. The wrinkled forehead suggested much thought and his eyes, with their canopy of shaggy-brows, gave a penetrating gaze to us small children. His voice and manner was gruff – a product of many years of smoking strong tobacco in his cob pipe.

Rosa was a good foot shorter than her husband, but not lacking in will, or authority… her grey hair always tightly twisted onto of her head was tightly pinned. She controlled and led the house and its occupants - never challenge, and played a ‘close’ hand at whist. I do not remember her without a pinny and her sleeves rolled up. Rosa’s voice was high pitched and brittle… using an even stronger local patois than her husband’s was. Rosa had been raised to follow Christian principles. As a child, she attended Chard Church three times on a Sunday as well as attending the Sunday School. 

Rosalie Cottage had been built a few years before Harry rented the house for his new bride. It had been built as an add-on to the original two story semi-detached cottages - built at an earlier age. There were two rooms on the ground floor: the larger  being the living room containing the cooking range, and the other, the parlour. Off a small hallway... stairs gave access to three bedrooms - off a tiny landing. Outside, a lean-to extension housed a workshop, kitchen and scullery. The lean-to greenhouse, used the extension as a back wall.

The house was accessed from Perry Street by a bow topped wooden gate set in a flint side wall, capped by large upright stones… beyond which… a brick path lead to the front door. The knapped-flint and brick cottages, nestle in their neat gardens, behind the garden wall, which runs around three sides of the plot… To the rear, the ground sloped up the hill and to the front runs St Margarets Lane. These three terraced cottages, were set upon a spot where the open down falls away to lush meadows, that lies in a combe, sheltering from the prevailing west wind.

The greater part of Tatworth had thatched roofed, timber-framed houses with lime washed walls over cob, [a mixture of soil, clay, straw and lime]… with tiny inserted windows. A cob wall was built up slowly… packed down, between boards or hurdles… each layer allowed to dry before the next built up before the boards removed – when the cob hardened. This was, in many circumstances, the method by which the enlargements of ancient hovels were built- randomly along the track… usually of two bedrooms that had to cater for the large families of the period. By building on additional dwelling space was provided… windows enlarged and roof spaces developed. None had main services until the water was piped to the village in the late thirties. Farm labourers were paid thirty shillings a week, and a carter with two horses to look after, received thirty-eight shillings.

1927 was a year of, continual rain. It was unceasing. The hay turned black from delayed raking in, trying to judge when it could be picked up. Even with hay drier, it was difficult. The farmers waited until October and still there were few days of continual sun. The year before prices had been bad and the farmers account was low. Now the poor harvest compounded to make the position worse. There was a great deal of unemployment and a movement away from the land into the towns and cities turned into a stream. 

The pride of the home was the new wireless, with its fretted front panel, glowing valves, waveband squeak and trailing aerial – powered by accumulator charged up at the local garage. The announcers, pedantically annunciating The King’s English, and the style of music, that of Edward German or Albert Ketelby. Like the rest of society, the programs were refined, precise and structured. As children we still played with our ‘cat’s whisker’ and headphones, using a saucepan to improve the sound.

The main meetinghouse open to all was the Poppe Inn. Before 1927, it was named The County Inn, or Hotel. Initially, in 1564, it was a cottage called Culverhays owned by John Bowdyche. It had a straw thatched roof with chamfered first floor beams, [a mark of quality], and an inglenook fireplace. My grandad and his sons frequented its low beamed interior most nights, for at least a couple of hours. In the clubroom, they played skittles, dominoes or shove-halfpenny whilst drinking cider. Most of the men of the village joined them for at least one night of the week. The pub, with cider at 2d a pint, provided a venue for the working men to meet – to discuss their jobs, the weather and all those other things which control their lives. The women and children were banned in the taproom and even in the saloon bar; it was very unusual to find a woman. The pub was the preserves of men. Women for the most part met each other whilst passing the gate – to gossip over the garden wall – invite neighbours in for a cup of tea – to read the tealeaves. There was sewing parties and mother’s meetings. In the main women did not meet up in an organized fashion at a particular venue.

The men were social, using the pub to remove themselves from the sounds of children and the insistent wife, who always needed help. The pub kept them in touch with the latest gossip and created a sense of kindred spirit… where the topic of conversation was the state of their kitchen garden, the troublesome weather and the success or failure of the weekend football or cricket match. It was a matter of great concern how well the village was doing in both these games and even though not everyone played all were most keen to hear that their village was represented successfully. At some point in the evening someone would start singing some well known folk song which would be accompanied by others joining in with comb-and-paper, penny whistle, and on a good night, a piano player. On a dark and windy night, when the fire was blazing well, you could here the jollity going on down the street, as the door opened to let in yet another caroller… bathed in a stream of warm light… to cries of hallo!

1931 was another bad year for rain fell all through the summer. It was wet throughout which was depressing enough without the national economy being under considerable strain. The Lord Chancellor ordered o compulsory wage reduction on all salary and wage earners. For a fifty-hour week, the labourers earned three pounds. Grandma tried to make up the shortfall by selling some eggs.

The police house in the village was not looked on as somewhere out of bounds but one of refuge and help. There was no serious crime only petty poaching, chicken steeling, pub brawls and the occasional robbery. There was just one policeman who walked and rode on his bike to check the roads, shops and houses. It was a matter of long hours of tedious work making sure that each day all of the area covered at least once. He had to check that the public house closed on time and that there was no bad behaviour and noise - created by the last ones to leave. Every year the constable paid a visit to the school to talk to the children about not stealing or harming animals. It was a matter of showing his face and getting to know the children personally. The same applied to the sports field where he always strolled round to show support and interest. It was expected that he should put in an appearance at church at least once on Sundays. The village policeman found it was in his interest to meet as many village people as possible – to see then at work and in their home environment. It made his job easier to be on friendly terms especially with the leaders of the community.

Most of the workers in the village, if not directly associate with the land, had an interest in rural matters. Even those men working at the mill or dairy had relations who were agricultural labourers or knew someone connected with farm animals. It was a rural landscape and that would never change. To a man, they were all poorly paid even those who had authority or a skill had little more than their unskilled counterparts. There is a certain binding of spirits when the majority are in the same boat – scraping a living. Their houses were mostly badly built, cold, damp and rotting. To keep them clean and dry was an uphill battle fought by the women. Gradually this picture changed, until the First World War bought the improvements to a sudden end. Then the   deterioration, which had been the position up to and during Victoria’s reign, continued.

Not long after WWI - during the thirties, the country's factories received more orders to rearm. This stimulated the economy allowing jobs and wages to increase. These affluent times allowed workers new rights - allowed more consideration. As their wages increased so did their horizons especially those who valued education… The population increased during the age of plenty. For towns and villages that had no local factory or business the young adults drifted away… there were only a few who were content to work in large houses or estates, the rest had to look elsewhere. The technical advances made to agricultural machines, created a knock-on affect... benefiting allied engineering component manufacturers; those who devised machine tools for mass production… There was a general interest in all matters technical. Every part of society felt the change - wished to take part in the ‘new society’.

This disruption to the old order and the mobility of the young, particularly those using the facilities presented by the new railway companies, allowed a migration away from the country. The young factory staff, construction workers, ship builders and domestic servants provided a stimulus to marriage and home building…, which in turn, caused an increase in the birth rate. At the beginning of the nineteenth century there were only fifteen towns with more than twenty thousand inhabitants… by the middle, there were sixty-three. At the turn of the century eighty per-cent of the population lived in urban districts with ten or more thousand. In the first quarter of the twentieth century only ten per-cent of the population owned their own home. By the late thirties, it was twenty-five per cent. These population statistics amply demonstrate the necessity to produce more housing and more food. These needs were felt in Tatworth.

      <comment>Improvements needed in folded dipole.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In particular the &quot;folded dipole&quot;, a recent interest of mine, shows a line with a 1/2 on one side and a 1/2 on another side of the top half of this picture.  This is wrong.     The top half is 1/2 wave length, and the bottom half is 1/2 wave length.  for a total of 1 wavelength (or lambda).  

No impedance formula, or typical impedance number is given for any antenna.   A typical Z value for a folded dipole is 300 ohms.   

There is no mention of J-pole,  Slim jim or cubical antennas are in this section. 

No link to phasing harness calculations, though you mention the topic in passing.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is in response to the article posted in September of 2008 on Traveling Kids.  It was a thesis for a Sociology Thesis in a Masters Degree Program.  The article is misinforming, subjective and inaccurate on many points.

It is vital that I comment on this very subjective and inaccurate article.  I know many young people who are part of this rapidly growing sub culture known as &quot;Traveling Kids.&quot;  They are not deviant.  They are not criminal.  They are not drug users.  Of course, like any sub culture, you will find a cross section of many behavioral types.  This includes the GOOD as well as the bad.  This article/thesis is grossly one sided, not based on factual information and misrepresents the movement.

Because these kids do NOT want recognition and have gone off the radar, it is more difficult to get an accurate description of their actions, philosophies and motives.  They &quot;like&quot; it that way.  It is not sinister and they are not an underground &quot;mob&quot;.  In addition, since this is a relatively new movement, there are fewer people who have retired from that lifestyle who are available to comment and shed light on the movement.

It is understandable to me as to why these kids have chosen this path.  First of all, with the downturn (crash) of the economy, going to college and staying in college is more challenging and literally impossible for those without parents who foot the bill.  This is because student loans are capped well before the necessary expenses are met.  Also, Pell Grants are fewer and of lesser amounts and work-study programs parcel out the work to many, making the amount earned peanuts.  I know of many young people, including some of my own offspring, who have faced this unimaginable situation.  The older one had an easier time obtaining funding for the first two years of music conservatory, and then halfway through his undergraduate work, funding was obsolete and cut off from him (and many others across the country). The financial aid advisor simply stated that he had &quot;maxed out his student loans.&quot;  What?  He was only halfway through the program and he had some scholarships?  I discovered that this was a national crisis that affected the majority of students.  He was a Dean's List student, and with his scholarships, and the meager amount of money that he had to work with (student loan)...there was not enough money for living expenses or books. (Few options for employment).  He literally blazed his way through it and did not leave his path, but he suffered greatly.  He experienced poverty in every sense of the word.  So, he can be categorized as someone who refused to give up, he was driven and actually one-step away from eating from the dumpster.  

How fair is that? (Sociology Student). Is the possibility of obtaining higher education in the United States is now tailored ONLY for the rich? Yes. Many students couch surf and DUMPSTER DIVE and share books in order to continue attending college alongside of their WEALTHY COUNTERPARTS.  Are they getting a fair crack at their education?  No.  The deck is stacked.  Under these circumstances, the constant worry about paying rent, getting food and EVEN BUYING TEXTBOOKS claims their energy and focus, leading to dropping out or getting lower grades.

Another of my children started college a few years later, and was faced with these impossible financial barriers from the first day.  She did not have one or two years of college under her belt to lean on or as a foundation when the lack of funding became in issue.  It was nearly impossible from the start.  

I know of another young many who recently completed his second year as a very successful student at Berklee School of Music, and he is now working every angle to find a way to continue to get student loans.  His resources have been &quot;capped.&quot;  I told him of some of the private loans available so that he does not have to quit.  These private/personal loans are much higher than student loans, government loans and Pell Grants! When these students finally graduate with an undergrad degree, they will owe enough money for a small house in today's market.  If they go to graduate school, they will have borrowed enough money (with interest) for a bigger house.

I see this all of the time.  KIDS WITHOUT OPTIONS.

And then there is the JOB MARKET!  Do I have to go there?  I will try to make it short.  Zero jobs.  The jobs available are chopped up into part time jobs so that the employer will not have to provide benefits.  Everyone from the student, the young non-student, the older population of unemployed and underemployed, college grads unable to find jobs in their fields....ALL COMPETING FOR THE FEW JOBS OUT THERE.  This environment enables employers to under pay employees and abuse their power of authority because if &quot;you don't like it, there are 100 people who are willing to do it for less...whatever &quot;it&quot; is.&quot;

The other option is THE MILITARY.  How convenient. With recruiters hanging around, dangling debit cards and promised bank accounts and free education, who wouldn't jump on it?  War is the alternative.  Really?  Not everyone is a warmonger, but sometimes-desperate measures call for desperate actions. The Traveling Kids choose not to participate in the &quot;Military Industrial Complex.&quot;  I have family in this war; I support our troops; it is the integrity of the leaders, the corporations and war itself that is in question.

With little or no options for youth in today's society; horrific corruption, loss of fragile eco systems, extinctions resulting in local and global devastation amidst the longest war in our country's history, why would anyone question the emergence of a growing sub culture of kids (young adults) who opt to remove themselves from the madness, travel and enjoy their lives without the twisted rules of a rapidly crumbling society slapping them around?

There is a code amongst these kids. (Most of them are educated with some college; some actually graduated).  They DO NOT STEAL OR PANHANDLE.  They do something for their money, such as busk (play music), sell handmade jewelry, knit hats, and juggle.  Many follow the harvests and planting seasons as migrant workers.  They stick together and are not much different from those (hobos) who travelled during the challenging eras of the Dust Bowl and Great Depression.  These are tough times.

There are many cities, counties and states on board – aware of this growing sub culture – that offer resources.  The &quot;kids&quot; know of these centers, which have become hubs around the country offering showers, food and a place to stay the night.  Many &quot;kids&quot; have friends across the country and open their homes to people passing through.  Traveling kids are easy to spot by their oversized framed backpacks.

I was appalled when I read this article.  In order to understand the true nature of this sub culture, you must be part of it.  To somewhat understand it, you must have contacts, family, friends – someone who you know well and who will take the time out to explain it in detail.  These kids are not slouches, nor do they expect to get something for nothing.  They do not consider themselves &quot;homeless&quot;; they refer to themselves as &quot;houseless&quot;.  They choose NOT TO BE A PART of this warped out society at this time, since many of them have run out of options.

There are a few different types of &quot;Traveling Kids&quot; that I know of.  
Old Timie kids who are modeled after Woody Guthrie, many play the banjo, accordion, spoons, etc.  
Crunchy Hippie Types, the ones you will see with dreds and carrying guitars and selling their beadwork.
Bicyclers; they ride their bikes all over the country.
Of course, there are many other &quot;types&quot; if we were to categorize them.  They are a microcosm of their generation on foot or bicycling around the country.  Are they better or worse than the &quot;kid&quot; who sits around mooching off Mom and Dad?  I find the fact that they are NOT freeloading, a higher form of character.

So, the bashing in this thesis is off the mark, subjective and narrow-minded.  I needed to write this, because I do not want the general population to get the wrong idea when they see these kids en route to their next organic farm harvest.  They are not homeless beggars; they are not criminals; they are not druggies.  No more than anyone else. Most of them are gutsy, resourceful and open to change and evolving.  

With such sparse information available, I was quite troubled that this is what people get when they Google &quot;Traveling Kids&quot;.

I am betting that you received an &quot;A&quot; on your thesis, because there is no point of reference.  I hope that more people respond to this one sided article.[[Link title]]

The '''buntline hitch''' is a knot used for attaching a rope to an object. It is formed by looping the rope (or other tying material) around an object, then making a [[Knots/Hitch knots/Clove hitch|clove hitch]] around the rope's [[Knots/Parts of the knot|standing part]], taking care to tie the two [[wikt:half hitch|half-hitches]] that compose of the clove hitch in the direction of the object, rather than away from it. Secure and easily tied, the buntline hitch will jam when subjected to extreme loads. Given the knot's propensity to jam, it is often made in slipped form.
== History ==
[[Image:Buntline-hitch-ABOK-1711.jpg|thumb|Untightened buntline hitch]]
Simple and effective, the buntline hitch dates to the age of sail, where it was used to secure [[w:Clewlines and buntlines|buntlines]] to the [[wikt:foot|foot]] of the sails&lt;ref name=&quot;histsci&quot;&gt;J.C. Turner and P. van de Griend (ed.), ''The History and Science of Knots'' (Singapore: World Scientific, 1996), 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tossguide&quot;&gt;Brion Toss, ''Chapman's Nautical Guides: Knots'' (New York: Hearst Marine Books, 1990), 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ashley225&quot;&gt;Clifford W. Ashley, ''[[w:The Ashley Book of Knots|The Ashley Book of Knots]]'' (New York: Doubleday, 1944), 310.&lt;/ref&gt;  on square-rigged ships. That the buntline hitch was the preferred knot speaks to its security and reliability.&lt;ref name=&quot;tossguide&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;budcomp&quot;&gt;Geoffrey Budworth, ''The Complete Book of Knots'' (London: Octopus, 1997), 51.&lt;/ref&gt;  Once set, repeated jerking and slatting tend to tighten it further rather than loosening it.&lt;ref name=&quot;pawpock&quot;&gt;Des Pawson, ''Pocket Guide to Knots &amp; Splices'' (Edison, NJ: Chartwell Books, Inc., 2002), 133.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its compact size allowed the foot of the sail to be drawn up as closely as possible to the buntline [[w:deadeye|deadeye]]s on top of the [[w:Yard (sailing)|yard]].

It has gained in popularity in recent years due to its performance in slippery modern synthetic lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;tossguide&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pawpock&quot;/&gt;

=== Security ===
While the buntline hitch is considered a very secure knot the turns of the clove hitch must progress ''towards'' the object, otherwise the much less secure [[Knots/Hitch knots/Two half hitches|two half-hitches]] will result.  Although not generally required, a [[Knots/Parts of the knot|round turn]] can first be made around the object causing the buntline hitch to be even less prone to slipping.&lt;ref name=&quot;ashley309&quot;&gt;Ashley, 309.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
[[Image:Slipped-buntline-hitch-ABOK-1712.jpg|thumb|Untightened slipped buntline hitch]]
The buntline hitch is useful for attaching lines to rings, eyes, posts, rods, and railings where a compact and secure knot is required.  The non-slipped form is appropriate for moderate loads or where the knot will not need to be untied often.&lt;ref name=&quot;tossrigg&quot;&gt;Brion Toss, ''The Complete Rigger's Apprentice'' (Camden: International Marine, 1998), 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  If heavily loaded it can be difficult or impossible to untie without the aid of a [[w:marlinspike|marlinspike]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tossguide&quot;/&gt;

The slipped form is more versatile and convenient when a secure temporary hitch is needed.  For example, the slipped buntline hitch is an excellent choice to fasten a line to one side of a vehicle's luggage rack, with a [[Knots/Binding knots/Trucker's hitch|trucker's hitch]] being used on the other side to tension the line over a load placed between them.

The buntline hitch is the same knot as the [[w:four-in-hand knot|four-in-hand knot]] used for neckties.&lt;ref name=&quot;pawpock&quot;/&gt;  When it is made in flat material in the manner used to fasten a necktie, the working end is brought more parallel to the standing part during tightening than generally seen when made in cylindrical cordage for load-bearing purposes.

== Tying ==
[[Image:Buntline-diagram.png|left]]&lt;br style=&quot;clear:left;&quot; /&gt;

The buntline hitch is simply a [[Knots/Hitch knots/Clove hitch|clove hitch]] tied around the standing part, with the turns of the clove hitch progressing towards the object.

=== Slipped variation ===
[[Image:Slipped-buntline-hitch.png|left]]&lt;br style=&quot;clear:left;&quot; /&gt;

The slipped variation is made by passing a [[Knots/Parts of the knot|bight]] through on the final step instead of the end.  To release, pull the bight back through knot by tugging firmly on the free end.

[[File:Blender259BeachBall.png|thumb|right|The finished render.]]
In this module, you'll create a beach ball with two alternating colours.  Along the way, you'll learn how to apply multiple materials to a single object.

Many real-life objects have parts which are different colours, or are even made of different materials. One way to model such objects is to make each part a separate Blender object. However, Blender also allows you to assign different materials to parts of a single object.
{{clear}}
== Set the Scene ==

Begin by opening Blender and removing the default cube. Then select the lamp and change its type from 'Point' to 'Hemi' in the Light settings in the properties window (object data button), this has the advantage of it giving more light.
&lt;br /&gt;
[[Image:Blender-2.6_change_light_type.PNG|thumb|right|The options for changing lamp type in the properties window]]

Now create a mesh for the beach ball:
# With the 3D View window active, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|A}}) and choose ''Add &amp;rarr; Mesh &amp;rarr; UV Sphere''.
# Set the controls under &quot;Add UV Sphere&quot; at the bottom of the left panel to 8 segments and 4 rings.
#: The initial result will be crude, but meshes with fewer vertices are easier to edit.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

To make the mesh rounder and more organic, go to the modifiers context in the properties window (wrench icon) and add a Subdivision Surface modifier. Set the values in the 'View' and 'Render' settings to '''2'''. And to get rid of that blocky look, go to the Tool shelf and set the shading to ''Smooth''.

The ball is now round, but a bit prolate.  To make it more spherical, scale it by about 1.1 along the X and Y axes. To select the X-Y plane, you select ′''not'' '''Z'''′, by using the key combination {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|Z}}. The complete sequence is, then, {{B3D:N2P/Do|S}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|Z}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|1.1}}.

{{clear}}

== Colorize Time ==

Now you're ready to begin adding colors to the object:
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Tab}} to put Blender into Edit mode.
# Select the &quot;Materials&quot; button [[File:Materials_button.png]] and press New
#: Several additional panels should appear in the Properties window.
# In the &quot;Material&quot; panel, set the Diffuse colour to one of your two chosen stripe colours, say, yellow.
#: At this point, the entire ball is yellow.

[[File:Blender259BeachBall_Yellow.png]]

In the &quot;Materials&quot; panel click the &quot;+&quot; button (indicated by the red box in the picture, below) near the top of the panel and to the right of the existing material list. This will create a new blank slot in the materials list.  A &quot;+New&quot; button will appear (indicated by the blue box, in the picture below).  

[[File:Blender259ObjectAddSecondMaterial.png]]

Click the +New button and a new material will appear in the materials list. Ensure it is selected in the list of materials and change the Diffuse color to the second color of your choice (the images in this tutorial use blue). Nothing will happen to the beach ball, yet.

All the vertices should still be selected from before; hit {{B3D:N2P/Do|A}} to deselect them. Switch to front view with {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}}, and to &quot;Face Select&quot; mode with {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Tab}} then {{B3D:N2P/Do|F}}. To avoid accidents, make sure you have &quot;Limit selection to visible&quot; enabled. Now select a column of four faces that will make up one stripe of the beachball (using {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|RMB}}):

[[File:Blender259BeachBall_Selected.png]]

In the &quot;Material&quot; property window, highlight the second chosen material (&quot;Material.002&quot;) in the materials list and click the &quot;Assign&quot; button.

Now rotate the view (e.g. {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM6}}) so you can skip past a yellow stripe adjacent to the blue stripe, and select the second column that will become a blue stripe. Work your way around the ball to do this two more times. (Remember we made the sphere with 8 segments; four of these are the yellow stripes, and four are the blue). Now you see why I chose to make the sphere with only 4 rings: more rings would have meant more faces in each stripe, and more clicking to select them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Parashah Chukat (regulation)  Numbers 19:1-22:1 

The title “Chukat” comes from the word which is used for a Divine ordinance that has no “rational” explanation. 

Within the category of Chukim (plural) are two levels; 
1) those decrees that could in principle be understood by human intelligence, but details of which are beyond comprehension, and 
2) those which are entirely beyond the scope of human understanding. The law of the Red Heifer belongs to the second category. 

Even Solomon, who possessed great wisdom, said that the only part of God’s Torah that he could not explain were the commands concerning the red heifer.  This weeks portion deals with the ashes of the red heifer, which are significant to us when we refer to ritual cleansing. It is very important to remember that to be unclean is not necessarily to be in sin. 

Many commandments are open to human understanding as they are explainable for social or moral reasons, as opposed to the Chukim which require us to obey without necessarily understanding the reasons for them.


&lt;u&gt;The Ashes of the Red Heifer&lt;/u&gt;

One generation has passed and another has grown up in freedom, prepared to enter the Land of Israel. The leaders of the older generation, too, are departing: first Miriam (Bamidbar 20:1), and then Aharon pass away in the same year. The instruction for this ritual is given before the passing of Mirium and Aharon. 

Most of the sacrifices of Israel were bullocks.  Logically, it is more desirable to sacrifice bullocks than heifers because heifers are used for producing offspring and for milk, so offering them for sacrifices is very sacrificial.  In this case, the female is offered, spotless and choice.

The ashes of the red heifer were used to purify the unclean, particularly those who had come into contact with a dead body. They could not come into the tabernacle without first being sprinkled with a solution of water and the ashes of the red heifer.   Even so, they were considered unclean until evening.   From the ashes of this heifer the purification water was made and kept in the homes of the priests throughout the whole land of Israel. That way, those who had been in contact with a dead body would be able to purify themselves for seven days according to the commandment. Only small amounts of ashes were needed for large amounts of water. Thus the ashes from the sacrifice of one heifer lasted for many years.
The Torah says that a crimson thread which tied together the cedar wood and the hyssop, were thrown into the fire with the burning flesh and the resulting ashes Yahweh used to cleanse those who were unclean.  Notice that the priest who supervised the process was ritually impure and could not enter the camp or city until he had immersed himself and his clothing in water.
One of the fundamental requirements is that the heifer had to be completely red.  The prophet has explained that sin is described as red;   “though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow” (Isaiah 1,18)

Throughout the history of Israel up to 70 AD, the ashes of nine red heifers were prepared, and the tradition is that the tenth one will be prepared when Mashiach comes.  When Yahweh conveyed to Moshe the statute of the red heifer, it is understood that the ashes from the original were to be mixed in with the next, so that there is always a continuance from the original red heifer which Moshe prepared.   It has been recorded that nine heifers altogether have been slaughtered over Israel’s history (Mishnah Parah 3:5).  Now, to continue this ordinance, a red heifer must be found and the remaining ashes from the previous temple era must be brought out from where they have been preserved to once  again make the “waters of purification” for the defilement of death.  
Literally it is called the “waters of menstruation” .  This is because, just as the menstrual flow of blood cleanses away the death of a potential life, so these waters (red as the likeness of blood and representing blood) cleanse a person from the contamination of death.

The Jews are at a loss to explain the significance of this ritual.  The red cow is a ritual that makes sense only when Yeshua the Messiah is added to the picture. 

Here are some clues linking the Red Cow to Yeshua; the color red, the burning of the cow, the cow’s spotless purity, she had never born a yoke, the heifer was slain outside the camp.  Additionally, hyssop, cedar wood tied with scarlet wool were thrown into the fire.  Each was symbolic of something.

* Red is the color of the stain of sin (Isa. 1:18, “though your sins be as scarlet...red like crimson.”). Red is also the color of the tzaaras skin infection dealt with in Leviticus 13:19,24,42-43. 
Red is also the color of clay earth out of which Yahweh formed the first man naming him Adam (Strong’s H#119/120) which means ruddy, red, bloody or rosy in color.  Red is also the color of the Second Adam, Yeshua the Messiah who was literally red covered in his own sacrificial blood while hanging on the cross.

* Burning the cow represents the death and suffering of Messiah on the cross.  More care was exercised in choosing a spotless cow than in any other sacrifice.  This spotless purity represents Messiah Yeshua the perfect sacrifice.  

* The red cow had born no yoke. Similarly, Messiah was neither under the yoke of sin nor was beholden to or under bondage to any human, institution, government, religious system or anything else of an earthly nature.

* The heifer was slain outside of the camp.  During the first and second temple eras the red heifer was slain on the Mount of Olives by the priests. The Mount of Olives was located off the Temple Mount and outside the walls of the city of Jerusalem (see The Pentateuch/Numbers, p. .329, by Rabbi Samson Hirsch).  Messiah Yeshua was sacrificed outside of the city gates of Jerusalem (Heb. 13:12) and very possible, contrary to Christian tradition, on the Mount of Olives from which the front of the temple and the veil was clearly visible from the place of crucifixion (Matt. 27:51, 54; Mark 15:38-39).

* The heifer was totally burnt. Messiah suffered in body, soul and spirit (Isa. 53) to atone for man’s sin.  Into the burnt offering fire went three things (See Stone Edition Chumash, commentary on Lev. 14:3, p. 621)

*cedar wood = haughtiness and loftiness of sinner in rebellion against God.  This points to the cross, which was made of wood.

* hyssop = to gain atonement the cedar one must bow in humility like a blade of hyssop. Hyssop was used to put the blood of the Pesach Lamb on the doorposts as well as to put the sour wine to Yeshua’s lips while on the cross. It is a medicinal plant known for its cleansing properties (Ps.51:7)

*scarlet = the stain of sin (Isa 1:18); the priests made red with dye from a snail or insect _ a lowly creature symbolizing the penitent’s new-found humility. This is one of the colors of royalty and prosperity (Proverbs 31:21, Daniel 5:7, Rev 17:4). 	It is the color Matthew describes as that of the robe the Roman soldiers put on Yeshua on Passover (Matt 27:28).

We also see these three used together, the cedar wood, the hyssop and the scarlet, in Leviticus 14 for cleansing.
Paradoxically, the preparation of the red heifer renders each person involved unclean. The priest who oversees the slaughter and the burning is rendered unclean. The man who ignites the fire is rendered unclean. The man who gathers the ashes together is rendered unclean. We learn in Numbers 19:21 that the one who sprinkles the water is also rendered unclean only until evening,  unlike those unclean from actual contact with death who were unclean for seven days. This is one of the great paradoxes of Torah. So too, in order to cleanse us, the Master became unclean.  In order to liberate us from death, He died. Yeshua took the curse upon Himself. He became death for us, so that we might be freed from death.  Just as those administering purification from death, are rendered unclean, so too Yeshua was made unclean, even taking on the contaminating impurity of spiritual death itself, in order to cleanse us from sin and death.

The writer of the book of Hebrews specifically mentions in Hebrews 9:13-14 the ashes of the red heifer. What is more, he attributes efficacy to them as regards cleansing the flesh. The passage compares the blood of Messiah to the ashes of the red heifer.  If the ashes of the red heifer work on the outside (the flesh), how much more so does the blood of Messiah work on the inside cleansing (the conscience) from sin.   In the case of Yeshua, his shed blood plays a central part in our cleansing. Were it not for the blood, which was freely spilled, we would forever be in a state of spiritual tamei!  Thanks be unto God, His blood was poured out for us to cleanse us from all defilement of death, both natural and spiritual!


&lt;u&gt;Immersion for Cleansing&lt;/u&gt;

“Then the clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day; and on the seventh day he shall purify him from uncleanness, and he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and shall be clean by evening.” 	(Numbers 19:19)

The Torah says that touching a corpse makes a person ritually unclean. To be cleansed, a person needed to be sprinkled with ashes from the red heifer. After completing the seven-day purification process by sprinklings with ashes of the red heifer, the defiled person was to immerse himself in water and then he was pronounced clean. 

In traditional Jewish practice, a corpse is prepared for burial by a special ritual washing of the body. To be among those who care for the dead in this manner is considered a high honor in Judaism. The early believers practiced the customary washing of the body. For example, when Tabitha died, Acts 9:37 says the community of believers washed her body. The ritual washing of the body is an expression of faith in the resurrection of the dead.  It is a preparation for resurrection.

Those who conduct the ritual washing, however, necessarily contract corpse contamination. Though the ashes of the red heifer would not have been applied to people living outside the land of Israel, the believers in Corinth would still have undergone the prescribed immersion in a mikvah (immersion bath). The same practice of immersing after washing the dead persists in the Jewish community today. Therefore, Paul asks rhetorically, “If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptized for them?” (1 Cor. 15:29)   In other words, if the dead are not raised, why practice the ritual washing of the body?   The dead will be raised, and the rituals of cleansing from corpse contamination testify to that coming resurrection. In that day, we will be cleansed from the ritual impurity of our dying, mortal bodies. We will be raised imperishable and pure like our righteous Messiah.

“A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up outside of the camp in a clean place; and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Yisra’el for a water for impurity: it is a sin-offering.” (19:9 HNV) - The ashes from the red heifer was split up into three parts, one part was placed on the Mount of Olives, another was placed in the area called “chel” and which surrounded the court of the temple, and one part was divided up between the twenty-four groups of priests that served at the temple. According to Mishnah,[Mishnah  Parah 3:1] the part that was on the Mount of Olives was used to consecrate the High Priests who was to prepare more red heifers. The ashes that were kept in the chel were meant for future generations, which this verse speaks about. The part of the ashes that was out in the land among the priests served to cleanse those of the children of Israel who lived in the other cities.


&lt;u&gt;Moshe Strikes the Rock&lt;/u&gt;    Numbers 20

The Aramaic Targums and oral tradition record that when Miriam died, the ‘well’ of water which had been with them as a source of supply for the 38 years, dried up.  Miriam was a Tzaddik, (a righteous person) and they had this blessing because of her prayer.  This is Israel’s last year in the wilderness, thirty eight years since they were told they could not enter into the land.  There are no records of the events in those years until we come to this time.   All of the first generation were deceased except for Moshe, Aharon, Caleb and Yehoshua and those of the tribe of Levi who were not represented in searching out the land and who therefore were not participants in the sin of the nation.   In Yehoshua 14: 1; 17: 4; 19:51; 21: 1, Eleazar, the new high priest, is mentioned as assisting Yehoshua in distributing the inheritance to the tribes after entering the land.  Aharon and Mirium die in the same year.

This situation seems similar to the past in the previous generation, of the people complaining against Moshe and Aharon. The rod which Moshe is commanded to take is the one which was before Yahweh - the one placed in front of the Ark in the Holy Place.  This was the anointed Branch which had been placed in the Holy Place as a sign of Aaron’s ordination by Yahweh. It was to be a sign to any future group that rebelled against the leadership of Aharon and Moshe.  (It was later used for the ordination of kings)  And so, with this uprising Moshe is instructed to go take the symbolic rod and go out to the people.  He rebuked them for their rebellion and struck the rock instead of speaking only to the Rock which would have glorified the power of Yahweh.

Here Moshe just at the end of the long journey and many years of faithful shepherding of Yahweh’s people amidst many trials with them, acts in a manner that causes him to not be allowed to enter the promised land.  We tend to overlook that Moshe and Aaron were held equally responsible for this action.  The area where Moshe is reported to strike the rock is a very hot and hostile part of the country.  In front of lots of thirsty people the pressure mounted and in a moment of anger and indecision, anger welled up inside Moshe and he struck the rock in disobedience instead of what he was instructed to do and speak to it in His Name. 

This incident at the Rock was one of Moshe acting in the flesh.  He had been instructed to take the anointed rod from before His Presence and speak to the Rock in His name, and not be involved in the issuing forth of the water as he had been on the previous occasion by striking the rock.  Yahweh wanted to be sanctified in the sight of the people for them to see His power demonstrated without an intermediary at the invoking of His name.  Imagine the impact when an inanimate object such as a rock responded to a command.  It would have brought the people to a higher esteem of Yahweh.  It was His answer to the people’s focus being on Moshe and Aaron and not looking beyond them to Him as their source of all things.   

There is no record of this new generation having seen the power of Yahweh at work.  The provision of manna had become commonplace as was His  Presence in their midst in the Cloud, they needed a fresh revelation of His manifest power.  And, whereas the people had looked to Moshe and he had been established in their sight as one who had the power to perform miracles, whom He had chosen to be His representative, He wanted this new generation that was to enter the land to go to a higher level of faith and look to Him directly.  Moshe failed to move out of the way and move into the new realm of faith, as he said, “must we bring water for you out of this rock” (20:13).  And so, both Moshe and Aaron are judged and not able to take the people into the land.  Moshe’s anger with the people caused him to rebel against the command which he was given.  It constituted a disqualification from leadership.  His disobedience, outburst of anger, and harsh words were prevented him entrance into his inheritance.

In Psalm 106:32-33, it is written,  “They angered him also at the waters of Merivah, so that Moshe was troubled for their sakes; because they were rebellious against his spirit, he spoke rashly with his lips.”

Moshe and Aharon, the leaders of the nation appointed by Yahweh, act out of their own mindset and react against the people’s rebellion. Yahweh allows the water to flow from the rock after it is struck the second time.  He doesn’t allow the people to suffer more than they could handle because of the disobedience of the leaders.  Yet, along with His mercy, we see a reminder of His requirements of responsibility especially where chosen leaders are involved.  Moshe was in a high visibility position.  The greater the calling the greater the responsibility.  Moshe, after his error, was not written off by Yahweh.  He continued to fulfill his calling but was denied the blessing, their entry into the Promised Land. 

Moshe broke prophecy by striking the rock. Yeshua is the rock from which Israel drank.   When he spoke to the Samaritan woman, He identified Himself as this  “Yeshua answered her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that said to you, Give me to drink; you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”  (John 4:10).


&lt;u&gt;Moshe negotiates with the Edomites&lt;/u&gt;

Their journey now take them into close proximity to some territorial enemies of theirs. In an act of cordiality and humility, Moshe offers to pass through the land of the Edomites without disturbing what belonged to Edom.  He even uses the identification marker of brother highlighting the well known fact that Edom was a descendant of Esav, the brother of Yaakov whom the Israelites were descendants of.  But despite his gentle pleadings in 20:14-21, Edom refused to allow passage, and instead turned a closed door to the wandering descendants of Yaakov.  The King of Edom was not too sure that he would be able to get rid of nearly three million people if he let them into his territory. Edom even issued a threat of the sword upon any that would cross into his land.  This incident will be remembered for ages to come.  Yahweh was not pleased with Edom and his prophets record Yahweh’s heart on the matter later for the people to read and understand. For now, Israel had no choice but to comply with Edom, and go around the long way.

In chapter 21, we read of their involvement with the king of the Emori.  Again, the same invitation is offered to them as with the Edomites, but this time Sichon, king of the Emori takes to the offence and attacks Israel.  Yahweh intervenes and Israel defeats the Emori all the way up to the borders of the people of Amon.  Following this successful campaign, Yahweh instructs Moshe to muster a small army and go against Og the king of Bashan as well.  Moshe does, and Yahweh causes a great victory there as well, with their complete destruction.
The promises of Yahweh did not come without a struggle. The Promised Land was not just handed over to the people. Rather, to secure what was theirs by covenant right, the people would have to go through the struggle to gain possession of it. 

This portions mentions many of the names of the places that the Israelites passed by or sojourned at during their time in the wilderness. Some of the places mentioned in the portion are known to us today and others are lost. Some of those that are known to us today and can be found on a modern map of Israel are; Kadesh Barnea, on the Western border of Israel with Sinai; Ovot or Ir Ovot (the city of Ovot), in the Arava on the road from the Dead Sea to Eilat; The Jordan River, Israel’s Eastern border with Jordan; The Bashan is what is known today as the Golan Heights, the strategic piece of land bordering with Syria and the city of Jericho, still in the same place that it was all those many years ago!


&lt;u&gt;The Bronze Serpent&lt;/u&gt;

As the people went around Edom (land of the descendants of Esau, Yaakov’s brother), they began to complain against Moshe and Yahweh in about the manna and the water. 

In the Gospels and Epistles, Yeshua is compared to the manna and the water. God sent “fiery serpents” to afflict the people.  He then gave Moshe the instruction of placing a “serpent” on a stick for people to look upon in order to escape the punishment.  Yeshua directly compares His coming to earth and being “lifted up”,  to the actions of Moshe lifting up the saraph/serpent on the stick (John 3:14).  

When God first gives Moshe this instruction (21:8), the term found in the Hebrew text (translated “serpent”) is Saraph, a type of angel.  The serpent in the garden represented the one who once was Lucifer, the covering cherub in the Holy Place in heaven itself - the arch angel. 

Moshe makes a physical representation of the Saraph in the form of a copper serpent.  The word for serpent (nachash), is spelled Nun-Chet-Shin. The word for copper comes from the same three-letter root and is spelled Nun-Chet-Shin-Tav.  In Hebraic studies an important point is made that the gematria (numerical value) of Mashiach (Messiah) and nachash (serpent) are both 358.  When words have the same numerical value they are related in essence, even if diametrically opposed on the surface.  In this sense, the yetzer hara (evil inclination) that came with the fall of Adam (linked to the serpent) will be transformed by the Messiah into a force which does good.   He was lifted up as the identification of all that the serpent caused and became sin for us.  Now, all who look to Him as the source of their salvation from the penalty of their sin, will be saved.

The serpent on the bronze pole is another prophetic picture of the redemptive work of Yeshua.   The bronze pole symbolises judgement.   The fiery serpents were a righteous judgment that Yahweh brought upon Israel for murmuring and unbelief.  Israel had “sharpened their tongues like a serpent” (Psalm 140:3) and “their throat [was] an open sepulcher; with their tongues have...used deceit; the poison of asps [was] under their lips” (Rom. 3:13). All this was directed at Yahweh and Moshe. They reaped what they had sown.  He loosed fiery serpents upon the Israelites to bite and sting to death the unbelieving murmurers.  

How often do we lash out with our tongues to kill, steal and destroy, to sow discord among brethren (which Yahweh hates and calls an abomination Prov. 6:16-19). The mouths of the unrighteous are an open tomb spewing out death and destruction (Rom. 3:13; Prov. 18:21). Many times it is the little comments, the innuendos, the sharp vocal tones, the little sarcasms, the cryptic comments, the criticisms and complaints in passing that do the most damage to others and grieve the Holy Spirit in our lives and in our assemblies.  Pray that you would be so full of the love of the Spirit that no evil word would come from your mouth, only that which is life to others.

The rabbis teach that Israel was punished with serpents because they acted in the manner of the serpent that deceived Adam and Eve, for they spoke malicious slander against the manna.  Both incidents involved food, a great area of weakness and one to which humans are subject to temptation 

Parallels between the bronze serpent and Yeshua:
* Both the serpent and Messiah were lifted up on a pole.
* Israel was to look up to the brass serpent; sinners are to look up to Messiah to be saved.
* Yahweh provided salvation from the sting of death from no other source but the serpent.
* Look at bronze serpent and live; look at Messiah and live.

Both the serpent and the cross are merely symbols of Yahweh’s grace and mercy. They simply point one to Yahweh in heaven who heals those who believe him and have faith in him.   Similarly, there is salvation in no other name but in Yeshua  (Acts 4:12).

The devil is the great red dragon/serpent (Rev. 12:3) whose venom inflames men’s sinful passions through his fiery darts aimed at humans (Eph. 6:16).  Fiery serpent is the Hebrew word saraph the plural of which is seraphim which is a type of an angelic, flaming spirit (Heb. 1:7). Though physical snakes bit the Israelites, this is nevertheless a picture of Satan, the fallen angelic being who is now the serpent and enemy of both Yahweh and man. Israel went though all these things for our examples (1 Cor. 10:1-12).  How they reacted to various situations is literally a mirror held up for our benefit for us to see ourselves as we really are so that we will not repeat their mistakes. We owe them a debt of gratitude, for we are able to gain spiritually at their expense.

The children of Israel kept the brass serpent for approximately seven hundred years when King Hezekiah finally destroyed it because the people were misusing it. This text teaches us that something positive that was given by the Eternal in order to bless the people, can become an idolatrous cult and a curse. In the same way the death of the Messiah, and even the cross, has become a cultic object that is worshipped through songs, incense, lighting of candles, etc.. Things which have been used to draw us close to Yahweh God can become an idolatrous object in themselves.
Some interesting or additional information: - the bronze snake that Moshe was instructed to make is the symbol used today by many medical institutions and practices.


&lt;u&gt;Aahron’s Passing&lt;/u&gt;

Aharon is to ascend Mount Hor dressed in the special garments of the Kohen Gadol. The transfer of these clothes to his older son Eleazar will constitute the transmission of the office of High Priest. Then Aharon will surrender his soul blissfully to Yahweh.

Aharon died, as he lived, totally devoted to serving Yahweh: and they ascended Mount Hor before the eyes of the entire assembly. And Moshe stripped Aharon of his garments and dressed Eleazar his son in them, and Aharon died there on top of the mountain, and Moshe and Eleazar descended from the mountain. (Bamidbar 20:27-28)
Aharon’s duties as Kohen Gadol were not complete until he fulfilled the transfer of his office to Eleazar. The same is true of every form of service to Yahweh. It is not enough that we serve Him, we are duty-bound to ensure that the next generation will do so, as well, just like Aharon.

Many people have asked why it is that we mourn for first seven days and then to a total of thirty days.  In the portion we have all the answers.  For the first seven days, besides the fact that the bereaved are having to deal with a lot of pain, they are also unclean if they came into contact with the deceased or if the death was in the home.  In the times of old, most people passed away at home or were killed in battle.  Traditionally the family prepared the deceased for burial. The first seven days (shiva) is the time when friends and family rally to meet the needs of the bereaved. They are not expected to cook or clean or perform any regular daily tasks.  The mourning is for a total of thirty days (20:29), this is for an additional 23 days after the initial seven.  Jewish men do not shave for this period and this helps to be an outward sign to others to be sensitive to their condition.  Sack cloth and ashes are no longer used but the corner of a garment is torn to mark the start of the time of mourning


&lt;u&gt;The Process of Overcoming&lt;/u&gt; — from sin to victory and salvation

While going through the wilderness of life if we have an attitude of gratitude instead of one of complaining, murmuring, doubt, fear and unbelief in the word and promises of Yahweh we will be more likely to understand his purposes, instructions, his heart and his plans for our lives.  One can waste one’s energy on murmuring and never grow up spiritually, or one can determine to hear Yahweh and to commune with him in the wilderness of life and seek spiritual enrichment out of that wilderness and view it as our training ground for entering the Promised Land instead of the negative attitudes which accomplish nothing except leading to death.

While crossing the wilderness Yahweh’s people must fight and overcome the enemy – i.e., that which would keep us from fulfilling our God-ordained destiny to possess the land and inheritance He has given us.  First comes the fighting and in overcoming, the victories.

Yahweh makes rivers to flow out of seemingly dry and barren situations.  We, too, are called to come to the rivers of salvation, the river of life and to become a river of life to all those with whom we come into contact (John 7:37-39).

      <text xml:space="preserve">For any triangle with angles A, B, and C, and corresponding opposite side lengths ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', the Law of Tangents states that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a-b}{a+b} = \frac{\tan[\frac{1}{2}(A-B)]}{\tan[\frac{1}{2}(A+B)]}.&lt;/math&gt;

Corresponding identities also hold in terms of ''b'', ''c'', B, and C and in terms of ''c'', ''a'', C, and A.

==When to use it==

This formula is nothing like as important as the Law of Sines or the Law of Cosines, which is why we have put it and its proof in the reference section.  This formula may be found in your formula book.  We're including it and the proof of it 'for completeness'.

Its main use, as far as we are concerned, is that to prove it is a good piece of practice in algebra with trig.

==Proof==
From the sine theorem,

:&lt;math&gt;{\sin A \over a} = {\sin B \over b}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a-b}{a+b} = \frac{\sin A - \sin B}{\sin A + \sin B}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;= \frac{2 \cos [{1 \over 2}(A+B)] \sin [{1 \over 2}(A-B)]}{2 \sin [{1 \over 2}(A+B)] \cos [{1 \over 2}(A-B)]} = \frac{\tan[\frac{1}{2}(A-B)]}{\tan[\frac{1}{2}(A+B)]}.&lt;/math&gt;


We're going to get you to spell out the details of each step in the above:

{{ExerciseRobox|title=Exercise: First Step - everything in terms of sin}}
Let's introduce a constant &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle k&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;k = {a \over \sin A} = {b \over \sin B}&lt;/math&gt;

Now express &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle b&lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle k, \sin A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin B&lt;/math&gt;.  Use these expressions for &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle b&lt;/math&gt; to remove &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle b&lt;/math&gt; entirely from &lt;math&gt;\frac{a-b}{a+b}&lt;/math&gt;.  

Finish by cancelling the &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle k&lt;/math&gt;'s.

{{Robox/Close}}

{{ExerciseRobox|title=Exercise: Second Step - Sums to Products}}
Use the sum to products formula for the second step, or express A and B as 

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle A = \frac{1}{2} (A+B) + \frac{1}{2} (A-B)&lt;/math&gt;

and 

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle B = \frac{1}{2} (A+B) - \frac{1}{2} (A-B)&lt;/math&gt;

and use sine addition formula to transform the numerator and denominator into products.  It might look a bit scary at first, but do it right and you'll see that lots of terms cancel out.  This step, using the sine addition formula, is actually practice in the derivation of the sum to products formula. 

{{Robox/Close}}

{{ExerciseRobox|title=Exercise: Third Step - Factor into tans}}

In the penultimate expression (i.e. the last but one expression), look for terms like:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x&lt;/math&gt; the same expression.  These can be replaced by &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \tan x&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x&lt;/math&gt; is that expression.  

Remember that if &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \frac{a}{b} = \tan \theta &lt;/math&gt; then it follows that  &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \frac{b}{a} = \frac{1}{\tan \theta} &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Chapter II:  Church and Home====

In close proximity to each other there were six religious houses, in and around Tatworth - five were non-conformist chapels, and all were built roughly within a generation of each other... demonstrating the nonconformist conscience of the population. In the first half of the nineteenth century, there were four lace mills in Chard and one in South Chard. All were busy producing lace [bobbin net] - using new technologies... the town was expanding. The generous act of Lord Poulett - donating land, enabled St Johns Church to be built - it was the last one; it is interesting to speculate how many others would have been built if that had been first? There is little doubt that the surrounding villages to Chard were enlarged rural hamlets, and their inhabitants were poor - closely allied to the land. The hardships of their lives – low wages and large families, ensured they would stay so. Children were brought up to adhere to ridged moral values, extolled every Sunday in all the religious houses. They were Christian, if not always, chapelgoers. Politically, the majority were radicals [extreme Liberals] – chartists and non-conformists - protestant dissenters, who did not accept the views of the Established Church.

Even if the Collins family were not frequent visitors to chapel or church, they accepted the accepted doctrine taught – about duty and honour. The older generation spoke about ‘one’s place’ in the order of things. The gentry were offered as examples of ‘the right way to do things’ – manners, habits, language and decorum. The Socialist Party, and Trades Union, were coming into being. The class structure clear in the country but confused in town. In the large houses and estates, snobbery ruled the different jobs.
  
These beliefs and manners approximately cover Queen Victoria’s reign. The industrialization of Britain - had an enormous effect on its citizens, particularly the country folk. Once begun its progress had a knock-on effect, prompting great scientific advances in almost every field. These created massive building projects. Young people left the land to seek work in towns and cities, which demanded the building of houses, and workplaces. As with all expanding societies, there were at the bottom an enormous number of poor, sick and handicapped people. The impetus of the expansion declined about the time of the second Boer War – about the turn of the nineteenth century.

As in all villages or towns, you were either church or chapel; and usually the parents dictated this choice - if the parents did not attend one or other of them then their children might attend one of the Sunday schools. Anyone who did not attend any religious institution was considered beyond the pale. The church and chapel goers did not mix socially with each other... their congregations, fetes, days out, celebrations, and high days and holidays, were spent apart. Both services had their own procedures – equally strict. Each religious sect was regulated outside the village or town by their institutions – with their books, hymnals, collect for the day, and flags, assiduously collected by their participants. Those who were Church of England had to face the journey to St Mary’s of Chard - to attend church. It had been a sore point for many years. Here they were the worshipers of the national religion having to put up with having to go all the way to Chard, or else go to a non-conformist chapel.

In 1827 a meeting had been arrange in the vestry to iron out the problem of too little seating. The unanimous conclusion was to have built a gallery. However, although this built it still did not meet the needs of the Tatworth parishioners. A further meeting found support for a mission chapel to be built, to accommodate all the Anglicans. The lord of the manor, Earl Poulett, contributed a quarter of an acre of land, and all the necessary stone, for the proposed structure, plus fifty pounds. The Langdon family of Parrocks Lodge presented the east and south windows, both to honour his own family. The building was designed by Mr Pinch of Bath in the Early English style and cost £1,400, and the builder, Davis of Langport - created the building of local stone.

The foundation stone was laid in June, the year of grace for The Great Exhibition, in 1851. The building was finished the following September, to be consecrated by the bishop of Jamaica, who stood in for the bishop of the Diocese who was ill. At the ceremony, the congregation witnessed the chapel’s first baptism. Just over eighty years later I too was baptised there only by then the chapel had become a church, and fully furnished. The start of the consecration began when the bishop and accompanying clergy, the village's' principle inhabitants, formed up in procession... to march to Manor Farm... leading all the assembled signatories. It was a grand occasion as they all filed into the church there to be met by the assembled congregation - turning in their pews to welcome the notables in. Some of the congregation could not be accommodated - the crowd was so enormous the overflow formed an aisle outside the great west door. After the service the bishop and those in the procession returned to Manor farm to be served with liberal refreshments.
  
In 1860 John Payne , the lace mill proprietor, presented an organ to the new church. By Order of the Church Council, in 1866, a new ecclesiastical district was formed which created Tatworth a Parish, now consisting of 1552 acres, and a population of 852 souls. The mother church of Chard retained the right to nominate each new vicar who in 1851 was that vicar’s son, Henry Bell Thompson who had been curate-in-charge of the mission chapel. In 1890, the church was called to attend to the funeral of the king of the gypsies, which was to become an annual service of remembrance - always well attended. The vicar's first job was to gather about him his church committee and start the Sunday school; depending on his authority, he controlled the type of service… in conjunction with the organist, or choirmaster.

The Vicar, tried to make the morning service as popular as possible - to draw in new adherents, but jobs in the home and farm prevented a large gathering. The local gentry did attend matins, which may explain why there were so few workers.  However, communion, for the confirmed, was straight after matins or morning service. Occasionally there would be an afternoon service if there was a christening or Mother’s Day service. If those were not laid on Evensong was at 6pm. The church was lit by oil lamps, which gave the interior a warm glow even on the coldest night. The flickering candles on the altar made a focusing point for the congregation. After the service, the congregation stepped out of the church into the blackness of the night with the cheery glow behind them. There was no traffic to worry about so the various families could make their own way home all walking in different directions calling out their ‘goodnights’. There was no fear that anything dangerous likely to happen – it never did. Everyone hurried home to get out of the cold.

Towards the end of the expansionist period there was an immediate increase in family size, which created a population explosion. Churches and chapels benefited - their congregations increased. This religious fervour continued right up to the First World War. The horrors of that campaign were felt all over Britain, and certainly by the county battalions. When the war was over there were fewer men left, and for those that were, many had lost their faith. The many single parents that were available to go to church were trying to bring up a family - lacked time and energy. The numbers attending church or chapel never returned to pre-war levels.
 
Families usually sat in the same pew. The congregation entered the church to kneel down to say their prayers for forgiveness - for any wrongdoing, before the service began. The collect for the day, or the weeks psalm, gone over in one’s mind… and no one spoke. The service was known by heart as were the hymns… the sermon, always long and boring… the collection, a period of coughing and movement. It was forever the same… the Langdon’s windows reflecting the spluttering candlelight and the decorated altar the only piece of colour. Fortunately, the heating managed by the sexton took the chill off the inside or it would have been most uncomfortable.In the summer, it was usual for families to visit each other in rotation after the evening meal, which, on a Sunday - was the main roast of the week. The older folk would ‘sit out front’ and converse with passers by. A special service was said for ‘The Churching for Women’. After having a baby women would go to the church and the vicar would read the service, which would cleanse her – release her from sin.

At about the age of twelve children were confirmed, after which they could attend communion services. For several weeks the candidates would attend classes one evening a week. They had to memorise and recite the Ten Commandments, The Creed, The Catechism, The Lord’s Prayer and various other psalms and collects depending on the vicar in charge. At the ceremony, the girls had to wear long white dresses, white shoes and veils. Boys wore their best school uniform. Each awarded a prayer book or hymnal. Modesty was considered an essential part of life. Sex was never referred to, parts of the body not discussed, child birth a total mystery, and was'nt climax something to do with a car or fire pump? Menstruation, even to women, a necessary evil, that nobody could quite explain, masturbation made you blind, and the Marquis d’Sade - all you could expect from a foreigner.

The picture commonly painted by artists of a ‘rural idyll’ shows a quaint timber framed cottage, with unruly thatch, chickens running about, children playing with a kitten and mother sitting on a stool outside the front porch with her lace pillow. The colours were clean; the light bright and there was not a scar to be seen. It was a picture of bucolic calm - gracing many greeting cards. However, it was not like that at all. Most cottages were either converted hovels, rows of terraced factory homes or estate houses. They were not owned by the inhabitant but rented. Mains water was piped to the village in the thirties and electricity some years later... and main sewers, some time after that. All had deficiencies relating to construction, few had any damp course, most were damp, and many leaked. The community existed by ‘following dear old dad’ - there was little place for individual action or free thought… for, 'what is good enough for me is good enough for you'. The dress code, hairstyle, meals,
habits and pastimes, ‘as they had always been’ – predictable; anyone who deviated was not accepted – considered a bit of a cad.

Was it any wonder that there were many undernourished and sickly children. Large families, little money coming in, and damp, draughty, unsanitary homes... were bound to lead to colds and influenza. Chilblains in the winter sun-stoke in the summer and little understanding about personal hygiene, all contributed to a poor physique. No one understood about the need for balanced meals and clean water. There were no inoculations or advertised health warnings. Hospitals, if visited, had to be paid for. If the family had previously paid into a penny a week health club or hospital scheme, then it was free. It was common for young children to have chicken pox, measles and whooping cough, and cases of diphtheria, and scarlet fever, were rare. TB and glandular fever feared, whilst rickets and blindness not unheard of.

Rosa Collins had a number of stillborn children that needed to be baptized before burial. It was not unusual for pregnant girls to commit suicide rather than face the disgrace of being a single mother. Divorce was unheard of, not that many wished they could. The main reason for women not wanting a divorce was that the courts found in favour of the man - they retained custody, the home and all the possessions. For men it was the shame and the cost. The main reason for discontent was the husband’s drinking, leading to physical assault. What made life at Rosalie Cottage so different was Rosa’s ridged rules of behaviour - which she demanded from her children. The were few crisis, life was structured along tried and tested paths. It may have been boring for nothing upset the ordered existence, but it was most certainly predictable – calm and ordered.
 
The society as a whole, prior to the turn of the nineteen-fifties, was disciplined. The majority lived by the law, the property owner and the employer. Over all would be the rules set out in the bible. Shame, honour, duty and integrity were qualities set out by parents, by example; the school – usually by motto, and church or chapel - by sermon. As most other people followed the same dictum, the qualities were reinforced.

All men wore a hat or cap summer or winter, it was the mark of a freeman - considered an essential part of daily dress. Women too put on a hat or bonnet when going out, wore gloves and did not think of attending church or chapel without wearing stockings. Men doffed their hats: when meeting a woman in the street, for prayers, Armistice Day parade, the National Anthem or when a funeral cortege passed by… A death in the village was accorded closed windows, drawn curtains and black armbands. My father insisted that my brother and I should raise our caps to neighbours, their friends and elderly relatives. This ended very quickly when we copied our friends and stopped wearing caps… but even then, we had to touch our forelocks. Eventually, even this mark of respect died out during the early part of the war… it was then that society changed - to be less formal.
 
It was an ordered society where anything out of the ordinary feared. This was never more so than for the handicapped that were treated as odd, sometimes ridiculed and certainly not considered. Many at the turn of the century confined to the workhouse or mental institution. For caring parents of such children it was extremely difficult, for the state provided no help.
The majority who went out to work understood that no attendance meant no pay and even if one attended - if for some reason work could not be done, payment would be stopped. Rain would only stop work if the animal could not produce. Thankfully there was always maintenance in the barn or outhouse to tide one over and if necessary using the flail to produce chicken feed. In times when no money came in a loan could be arranged from the tally man or produce bought ‘on tick’. Everyone used cash even the employer who paid weekly. It was considered a disgrace to be in debt and ‘saving up’ was the order of the day. Most homes had a number of tins where money was put for each article of expense – so much for the paraffin, the weekly shopping, the butcher, and baker; the coalman and the rent. There was a good deal of swapping between the tins!

Individuals were extremely independent, especially my grandfather who would not accept charity in any guise. There were no social services or welfare relief other than an amount for the insurance man who called weekly... there was nothing for a rainy day. Anyone too old or feeble ended up in the workhouse, if the family could not look after them. Workhouse inmates were expected to do some work in the cookhouse, laundry, or garden. If too infirm, put into a special sickroom where the fittest fed the others. Because travelling was difficult, the inmates rarely had visitors, which made life that of a prisoner. Chard had the nearest workhouse which was divided into casual and residential sections - casual for vagrants, usually ex-soldiers – some shell-shocked, who moved from place to place, chopping wood before moving on. Residential inmates, were long-term, some children reared by the workhouse, other orphans, some pregnant – who had been thrown out of their home. The workhouse children were found work when they came of age others apprenticed or joined the services. The workhouse was provided with money from the rates, by donation or by benefaction. Life was hard not just, not because money was short, but by intent. It was considered that to earn ones keep was essential and that the harder life was the faster inmates made progress to leave – to make room for others.
During the depression – between The General Strike and rearmament for the Second World War - in the early thirties, large numbers of unemployed and displaced men roamed the countryside looking for work. They often slept in barns or outhouses and begged house to house. They were not abusive but filled with sorrow that they had nowhere to go.

In the early twentieth century most men smoked – it was considered unmanly not to; the whole action of: buying, unwrapping, lighting-up, holding, expelling, stubbing out and conversing, was part of society – even part of the social graces. In some cases, buying tobacco considered more important than buying food. Cigarettes and tobacco was issued to the services, they were used as barter, often as contraband or as a bribe. The smell was considered sexy, masculine, homely and calming. Children collected cigarette cards and mounted them in books provided by the tobacco companies. They swapped them, stole them, collected the stubs, and made them. No male wishing to ingratiate himself - enter into a group - start a conversation, or feel at ease, shunned the use of his cigarette case. It was part of life - promoted, advertised, issued, and welcomed.

The village folk were lucky, not only did they have a lace mill employing, in good times, a hundred workers, but a thriving butter factory - with room for twenty. It had a railway terminus with ancillary sidings and sheds, and a corn mill at Forton providing animal feed. There were shops, in Tatworth and South Chard, and at least two main employers of any number of agricultural workers. All these businesses required servicing with a wide range of skilled workers plying their crafts and trades. They, in turn, employed trained helpers, fellow workers, and apprentices. This was indeed a thriving community each person relying upon the other in their work and in the home. Amongst these were the local masons, carpenters, thatcher, and decorators. The carters, farm implement makers and smiths all combining to turn out carts, wagons, and buggies. The miller was relied on to turn the corn into flour, and the brick, tile, and pipe maker, to provide the local building materials… some of his work lined the kiln for baking the lime and making more bricks. Many of these men turned their hand to other trades to affect a smooth flow of work throughout the seasons.

All these workers relied upon the work of a horse – mostly for pulling carts of farm implements, about their daily lives. They had been brought up with a knowledge and respect for its work and loyalty… for they knew they relied upon its power attending to its wellbeing. The local farrier and smiths were there to look village horses in sickness and in health correcting faults by applying the correct shoes. There were specialist smiths for shoeing, hammering out bent tools, sharpening tines, and making cranked handles for wells, gates, railings, and ornamental flower baskets. Ties for builders, chisels, and mending buckets… such a variety of work it was sometimes hard to fit in making the hooped tyres for the wheelwright. The engineering shop down by the station sidings performed a service to the lace mill whilst providing smaller more specialised items for all the other trades.

In general, whilst the village worker received sufficient in his wage packet to pay his rent and provide food he was content. As soon as his wellbeing was disturbed by famine, pestilence or war he became questioning and unhappy. If he heard about others whether in the next village to nearest town, receiving more he became dissatisfied… this was particularly so of the young.
For much of Queen Victoria’s reign the country was comparatively stable. What applied – to normal behaviour, habit, custom, and pastime at the start of her reign, continued until the end. The effects of enclosure, bad harvests, the coming of the canals, steam, and the railways all had some effect on countryside life but it was a filtered change - slow to take full effect. What brought about massive change quickly was The First World War and its aftermath, a period she was not to see. Things would never be the same again in Merrie England!

Harry Collins was lucky in his choice of home. Others had to go to the village pump or collect rainwater. Rosalie Cottage had an abundant supply of clean sparkling water that never dried up even in the hottest summer. The new family had their first child Foster Fred a year after they moved in, in 1892. Thereafter they were blessed by the birth of fourteen more children, two being twins, over the next twenty-four years. Eight eventually married and six died whilst still young. Their cottage was of later build than their neighbour’s thatched homes, with a tiled roof, occupying a triangle of land between stream and road ringed on two sides by a low wall. The remaining side held an eight-foot high grassy bank peppered with an abundance of meadow flowers and fern, which when young has bright green fronds. At its foot runs a deep but narrow, gravel-bottomed, fast flowing brook - fed by numerous springs. This also drains the water running off Storridge Hill – the highest point around, and Monkham Down. Close to the cottage, the brook’s edge was lined with large stone blocks which prevented the water overflowing when in flood. Just over the small lane at the bottom of the garden, [St Margarets Lane], was Mr Jaco Parriss’ flint sided, tile-roofed cottage.

The brook, called ‘Water Lake,’ was not a lake at all but a slow stream which provided clear, sparkling water... alive with shoals of minnows. Lower down, watercress beds kept the water clear and fresh. This brook doubled as a convenient refrigerator for milk and butter in the summer... its waters irrigated the kitchen garden, filled the chicken’s bowls and flushed the privies. These rushing waters were slowed, lower down its course, by widening out to give space for untamed horseradish, brooklime, marsh marigold and crowsfoot. Its waters and wetland harvest explains why the cottage might have been built there in the first place.

While our family were on holiday we boys, up early - when excitement refused to allow us to linger in a warm bed, were out in the garden drawn by the temptations of the stream. The early morning sun’s rays caused the rounded pebbles laying at the stream's bottom to shimmer… its crystal clear water appeared like cut-glass, so sharp the shapes. The water, corralled by the edging stones on one side and the bank on the other, passes the backs of the cottages to enter a large pipe - that takes the water under the road bridge, and onwards towards Axminster. This convenient water had another use; carts for farm and home use had wooden wheels, even though having iron tyres fitted. One of the purposes for village ponds was to keep the wooden wheels from becoming too dry and shrinking.
 
By turning left out of the front gate, you could follow the course of the stream under the bridge – a ford when the road flooded. The fording place at the foot of the rise in Perry Street was wide and a water splash for the passage of carts. Above, the stone arched bridge, its parapets polished by the sleeves of countless travellers - carries the road that grandfather and his two sons took each evening… that led to the Poppe Inn. The water flows out of the pipe and swirls about creating a spreading pool - before the water - penned in once again, conforms to the line of the bank to continue its chuckling way towards the coombe.

Milk was always in plentiful supply; Harry worked at the Wiltshire United Dairies, butter factory, as did his son Hector They  had ‘an arrangement’ with the dairy to provide them with butter. Anything extra that could not be afforded came from relatives who worked on the land or neighbours whose gardens produce a surplus. The dairy farm milked its own cows; filling the sterilized milk churns with fresh milk, to be delivered to each house in the village. The gaily-painted horse-drawn milk float – a two-wheeled cart open at the back with a step, for the driver holding the reins. It held a number of churns; the largest had a tap from which the white coated milkman, in formal peaked cap, filled the offered jug. When delivering to the door he carried the milk in a bucket, which he ladled out in pint or half pint measures. The horse knew the route and each house on the round… the milkman walking behind…

The farm worker’s lunch consisted of cheddar cheese and a large slice of bread and pickled onions - to be eaten in the field being worked on, or in the barn, first putting the nosebag on his horse… The milkman, usually in two-pound wedges, also delivered the cheese. The food was mainly homegrown and seasonal coming from Grandad’s kitchen garden. The diet never changed from one year to the next. It was fine when picked early in the season but proved to be hard tack later on when the beans old and stringy. What wasn’t eaten went into the chicken bucket; they did not seem to mind! Potatoes were the staple fare hardly ever mashed or roasted and not often cut up. They were plonked onto your plate with a knob of butter and liberally sprinkled with a tapped, knife-full, of salt. The rhubarb bed provided a continuous supple - like the potatoes, fine eaten in the season  but hard, course and stingy, later on. Soon after the main crop of rhubarb, came the red and black currants or his prize gooseberries that seemed to last and last... to make gooseberry pie, tart, fool, pudding and jam. New french green beans, runners, peas and sugar pea.

The mushrooms from the field over the bank, the blackberries from the straggly hedge by the bridge and the wild apple up the lane next to the stile. Each year they gave their crop for us children to pick and grandma to cook. Whatever we brought home went into the pot. It was never wasted.It was a regular meal, to have roast chicken, one of the flock, taken from the bottom of the garden. It hung outside the backdoor ready to be plucked. No one could strip a bird quite like grandma who had it done in a trice. When cooked my brother and I claimed a leg each and as a special treat the parsons nose.

The shelves in the lean-to kitchen were packed with kilner jars. Either empty ready for filling or bearing their contents like a chemists shop. Most would bare blanched plum, greengage or damson. The bead-fringed muslin lay over the sugar jar above the curly treacly-coloured flypaper swaying in the breeze from the open door... bearing testimony to their worth. I close my eyes… imagine myself pressing the catch to the garden gate, and start to walk up the brick path… Then, smelling the box hedge, step into the hall greeted by yet another smell - now what is it… damp wood - slightly musty, could be old clothes? I go on… into the living room, now it’s stronger, like a bonfire - of burnt wood and ash, with a hint of lamp-oil and tobacco…

There was no time to linger – to stand and stare. Grandma would not let you stand idle. There were the eggs to collect, the chickens to feed and the washing to put out. 'Have you cleaned your-shoes-put-your-pencils-away-hung-up-your-jacket-made-your-bed-and-emptied-the-pail…', all said in a high-pitched cackle, with waved pointed finger like an orchestra conductor. There was no argument or discussion it was best to seek out grandpa in the shed and helps chop the wood...!

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Sphinx was a creature that had the body of a winged lion, and the face of a woman. She terrorized the city of Thebes like this: she would ask anybody traveling on the road to Thebes a riddle. If they answered it, she would let them go. However, if they didn't say the right answer, she would kill them. This continued for a long time, until one day, a stranger by the name of Oedipus encountered the Sphinx on the way to Thebes. The sphinx asked him this riddle:
''What creature goes on four feet in the morning, two at noonday, and three in the evening?''

Oedipus correctly answered ''man'', and the sphinx killed herself.

''(The answer to the riddle is man, since a man crawls on four feet when he is very young [morning], walks on two feet in the middle of his life [noonday], and walks with the help of a cane [the 'third leg'] near the end of his life [evening])

The hypergeometric distribution describes the number of successes in a sequence of ''n'' draws without replacement from a population of ''N'' that contained ''m'' total successes.

It's  probability mass function is:
:&lt;math&gt;f(k) = {{{m \choose k} {{N-m} \choose {n-k}}}\over {N \choose n}}\text{ for all }x \in[0,n]&lt;/math&gt;
Technically the support for the function is only where ''x∈[max(0, n+m-N), min(m, n)]''. In situations where this range is not ''[0,n]'', ''f(x)=0'' since for ''k&gt;0'', &lt;math&gt;{0\choose k}=0&lt;/math&gt;.

====Probability Density Function====
We first check to see that ''f(x)'' is a valid pmf. This requires that it is non-negative everywhere and that it's total sum is equal to 1. The first condition is obvious. For the second condition we will start with [[w:Vandermonde's identity|Vandermonde's identity]]
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{x=0}^n{a \choose x}{b \choose n-x}={a+b \choose n}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{x=0}^n{{a \choose x}{b \choose n-x} \over {a+b \choose n}}=1&lt;/math&gt;
We now see that if ''a=m'' and ''b=N-m'' that the condition is satisfied.

====Mean====
We derive the mean as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \sum^n_{x=0} x \cdot f(x;n,m,N)  = \sum^n_{x=0} x \cdot {{{m \choose x} {{N-m} \choose {n-x}}}\over {N \choose n}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = 0\cdot {{{m \choose 0} {{N-m} \choose {n-0}}}\over {N \choose n}}+\sum^n_{x=1} x \cdot {{{m \choose x} {{N-m} \choose {n-x}}}\over {N \choose n}}&lt;/math&gt;
We use the identity &lt;math&gt; \binom{a}{b} = \frac{a}{b} \binom{a-1}{b-1}&lt;/math&gt; in the denominator.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = 0+\sum^n_{x=1} x \cdot {{{m \choose x} {{N-m} \choose {n-x}}}\over {{N \over n}{{N-1} \choose {n-1}}}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = {n \over N}\sum^n_{x=1} x \cdot {{{m \choose x} {{N-m} \choose {n-x}}}\over {{N-1} \choose {n-1}}}&lt;/math&gt;
Next we use the identity &lt;math&gt;b \binom{a}{b} = a \binom{a-1}{b-1}&lt;/math&gt; in the first binomial of the numerator.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = {n \over N}\sum^n_{x=1} {m {{m-1 \choose x-1} {{N-m} \choose {n-x}}}\over {{N-1} \choose {n-1}}}&lt;/math&gt;
Next, for the variables inside the sum we define corresponding prime variables that are one less. So {{nowrap|''N′&amp;#61;N−1''}}, {{nowrap|''m′&amp;#61;m−1''}}, {{nowrap|''x′&amp;#61;x−1''}}, {{nowrap|''n′&amp;#61;n-1''}}.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = {m n \over N}\sum^{n'}_{x'=0} {{{m' \choose x '} {{N'-m'} \choose {n'-x'}}}\over {{N'} \choose {n'}}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = {m n \over N}\sum^{n'}_{x'=0} f(x';n',m',N')&lt;/math&gt;
Now we see that the sum is the total sum over a Hypergeometric pmf with modified parameters. This is equal to 1. Therefore
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = {n m\over N}&lt;/math&gt;


====Variance====
We first determine E(''X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'').
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = \sum_{x=0}^n f(x;n,m,N) \cdot x^2 = \sum_{x=0}^n {{{m \choose x} {{N-m} \choose {n-x}}}\over {N \choose n}} \cdot x^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = {{{m \choose 0} {{N-m} \choose {n-0}}}\over {N \choose n}} \cdot 0^2+\sum_{x=1}^n {{{m \choose x} {{N-m} \choose {n-x}}}\over {N \choose n}} \cdot x^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = 0+\sum_{x=1}^n {{m {m-1 \choose x-1} {{N-m} \choose {n-x}}}\over {{N \over n}{{N-1} \choose {n-1}}}} \cdot x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = {mn \over N} \sum_{x=1}^n {{{m-1 \choose x-1} {{N-m} \choose {n-x}}}\over {{{N-1} \choose {n-1}}}} \cdot x&lt;/math&gt;
We use the same variable substitution as when deriving the mean.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = {mn \over N} \sum_{x'=0}^{n'} {{{m' \choose x'} {{N'-m'} \choose {n'-x'}}}\over {{{N'} \choose {n'}}}} (x'+1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = {mn \over N} \left[\sum_{x'=0}^{n'} {{{m' \choose x'} {{N'-m'} \choose {n'-x'}}}\over {{{N'} \choose {n'}}}} x'+\sum_{x'=0}^{n'} {{{m' \choose x'} {{N'-m'} \choose {n'-x'}}}\over {{{N'} \choose {n'}}}}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
The first sum is the expected value of a hypergeometric random variable with parameteres (n',m',N'). The second sum is the total sum that random variable's pmf.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = {mn \over N} \left[{n'm' \over N'}+1\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = {mn \over N} \left[{(n-1)(m-1) \over (N-1)}+1\right]={mn \over N} \left[{{(n-1)(m-1) +(N-1)}\over (N-1)}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
We then solve for the variance
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = \operatorname{E}[X^2]-(\operatorname{E}[X])^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = {mn \over N} \left[{{(n-1)(m-1) +(N-1)}\over (N-1)}\right]-\left({mn \over N}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = {Nmn \over N^2} \left[{{(n-1)(m-1) +(N-1)}\over (N-1)}\right]-{(N-1)(mn)^2 \over (N-1)N^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = {nm(N-n)(N-m)\over N^2(N-1)}&lt;/math&gt;

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

If you have questions, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Balak  (Destroyer)  Numbers22:2-25:9)
Micah 5:6-6:8;  2Peter 2:1-22

This parasha contains the famous story of the talking she ass as well as some of the most beautiful poetry in the Tanach, which was the blessing over Israel which came through the prophet Balaam. 


&lt;u&gt;The Historical Setting&lt;/u&gt;

Balak was a militaristic ruler, living and interacting with other militaristic rulers in a society that was essentially devoid of what we understand to be moral values.  In his world, a mighty nation simply ran from one victory to the next, and would not stop unless beaten back.  No nation emerging from a successful campaign against Sichon and Og as Israel did, would lay down its weapons when facing Moab and so Balak was afraid, because he could not comprehend the idea of a nation that would refuse to wage war merely because Yahweh told them to stop and had ordered them to live in peace and not attack another nation when it was clearly within their power to do so.  Balak saw Israel’s victory over Sichon and Og, and he worried. 

Balak (waster) was the son of Zippor (little bird) king of Moab.  He reported back to his father that Israel had grown very great since coming out of Mitz-ra-yim (Egypt), so Zippor sent an ambassadors to Balaam whom Josephus tells us lived by Euphrates, and was the greatest of the prophets at that time (Josephus Book 4 Chapter 6).   He was from Pethor, a city located on the Northern Euphrates/Tigress Rivers area called Mesopotamia. (Stone Chumash, p. 857).  Thus Balaam was a Babylonian. 

The king offered Balaam a great reward to curse Israel.  Balak, fearing his demise at the hands of the Israelites, calls upon Balaam who has a reputation as a man with prophetic gifting and power with his predictions, and invites him to come and curse the people of Israel. Yahweh instructed Balaam not to go with them. 

But the enticement of honour and riches causes Balaam to seek permission from Yahweh to go with the delegation that Balak sends to him. He has enough fear of Yahweh God to know He cannot speak other than what Yahweh gives him to speak and to not go without His seeking the liberty to do so.
“And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, “If the men come to call you, rise and go with them, but only the word that I speak to you - that you shall do.”  Numbers 22:20

Balaam, in his blindness of heart, invoked the wrath of Yahweh in seeking to go and join Balak against His perfect will. Yahweh sends an angel to arrest him in the way and block his progress. 

The Angel of Yahweh. The term Angel/Messenger of Yahweh used here shows this “Messenger” to be equivalent to Yahweh himself (see Gen. 31:11,13; Exod. 3:2,14; Jud. 6:12-24).   

The donkey, upon which Balaam is riding is the only one seeing the angel with his sword drawn and proceeds to turn off the path, squash Balaam’s foot and lie down, in this process incurring many a beating from Balaam.  After a discourse with the angel, Balaam is allowed to continue with the instruction that he is only to say what he is given to say.

Yahweh actually humbles this famous, renowned “prophet” of the nations and “prophet” to kings by speaking to him through his ass. This “prophet/seer” could not even see the angel until He opened his eyes.  Yahweh is always in control and he let Balaam know it in a most curious, humbling and demonstrative way.Yahweh makes a mockery of Balaam’s claims in front of the Moabite delegation when the lowly she-donkey is able to discern the presence of the Messenger of Yahweh and Balaam is not. 
Notice how Balaam‘s words regarding himself do not acknowledge his dependence upon God.
“The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor, and the oracle of the man whose eye is opened, The oracle of him who hears the words of God, and knows the knowledge of the Most High, who sees the vision of the Almighty, falling down, yet having his eyes uncovered.   “   (Nu.24:3-4)

Scripture seems to indicate that Balaam had some knowledge of the truth of Yahweh (2 Peter 2:15).    Balaam calls Yahweh “Most High” and “the Almighty”. He had great respect for Yahweh, but he had no faith, fear or love of him to obey him.   (23:15-25)   

Balaam claimed to hear the voice of Yahweh, yet his claims and the reality of the facts were two different things.   2 Peter 2:15 indicates that Balaam had some knowledge of truth, but turned away from it loving instead the “wages of unrighteousness.”

Josephus never supposes Balaam to be an idolater, nor to seek idolatrous enchantments, or to prophesy falsely, but to be no other than an ill-disposed prophet of the true God.  He views it that Yahweh only permitted Balaam to go along with the ambassadors, in case they came and called him, or positively insisted on his going along with them: whereas Balaam seems out of impatience to have risen up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and rather to have called them, than stayed and waited for their calling him, so zealous does he seem to have been for his reward of divination, his wages of unrighteousness.

Also, Balaam is really desirous of pleasing Balak, even though he renders token obedience to please Yahweh, recognising that He is the source of all power (23:36).  At heart Balaam is a man-pleaser, not one who pleases Yahweh.  Yeshua castigated the religious hypocrites of his day for the same thing (John 12:43).  Do we care more what men think when it comes to obeying the truth of Yahweh, or do we often take the easy way out, the path of least resistance which pleases the flesh and those around us?  

The wickedness, foolishness and arrogance of Balaam, to think Yahweh would give him a curse against Israel, Yahweh’s own people. Yahweh who made the ass to speak, pried out of a stubborn ass of a man, words contrary to the man’s heart’s desires making him to speak a prophetic word in accordance with the divine will.  Numbers 23:1 

But the moral of the story is that Yahweh is sovereign over the affairs of men regardless of men’s machinations. Yahweh cannot be manipulated or bent to men’s selfish ambitions. In the end man will be humbled and Yahweh will be exalted as was the case with Balaam, the arrogant and esteemed international “prophet”. He was made to look like a fool through a talking donkey and all this in front of the accompanying delegation of Moabite leaders. 

It was evident to all that Balaam was but a pawn in the hands of Yahweh, and that if Yahweh could make a brute beast speak, then he was certainly capable of making a mortal man say what he wanted him to say.  How often do we attempt to bend His will to fit our own, and how often do we have our own carnal and selfish agendas and then attempt to convince ourselves and others that it is the will of Yahweh?  Some people go through life on this basis and never succeeding in anything since they have never learned to distinguish between their will and that of the Almighty. 


&lt;u&gt;The Prophetic Declaration&lt;/u&gt;

Balaam tried to find some iniquity, some perversion in Israel which would give him legal grounds to curse Israel, but could find none (23:21).  Remember, a curse causeless shall not land (Prov. 26:2). 
It is only after several failed attempts that he finally realizes that Yahweh will not allow Israel to be cursed.  
Even a wicked, greedy, scheming sorcerer/“false prophet” had enough spiritual savvy to know that he could only speak when and what Yahweh willed (1 Corinthians 12:11).  

Eventually, he turns quite sarcastic towards his patron, Balak, King of Moav, and then provides him with one more “free,” unsolicited prophecy (Bamidbar 24:14-24). In this last speech, Balaam is finally free from his internal struggle and his attempts to satisfy Balak’s desire to pronounce a curse. Balaam is at long last able to see things in a wider perspective.  He soars in prophetic genius. With prophetic insight, he is able to envisage the people of Israel as they are meant to be.  He transcends the narrow vision of Israel in the desert, his new perception leading him to an appreciation of the true destiny of Israel.
We find that the words of Balaam which were intended as a curse, in the end were high praise for the nation.  They not only made it into the Torah for all time but also into the daily liturgy, “How goodly are your tents oh Yaakov, your dwelling place Yisrael...” (Numbers 24:5- 9)  as a blessing on the people of Israel. The blessing closes with the verses, “Blessed be all who bless you! Cursed be all who curse you!” 


&lt;u&gt;Balaam’s Prophecy&lt;/u&gt;

The place where Balaam went to offer sacrifices was called the “heights of Baal”.  He offered seven sacrifices on seven altars on a mountain high place used for Baal worship from where he could see the edge of Israel.  Numbers 23:4 – 

In the Aramaic Targums it is recorded that when Balaam went to one of the high places with the intent of cursing, he was so overcome with the sight of Israel’s encampment and the presence of Yahweh upon them, that the anointing came upon him and he declared,  “The Word of the Lord is with them, and the trumpet of their glorious King protects them” (Targum Jerusalem XXIII)

He took up his discourse and said, “The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor, and the oracle of the man whose eye is opened, The oracle of him who hears the words of God, and knows the knowledge of the Most High, who sees the vision of the Almighty, falling down, yet having his eyes uncovered.   “I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near; a star shall come forth from Jacob, a scepter shall rise from Israel, and shall crush through the forehead of Moab, and tear down all the sons of Sheth.   
“Edom shall be a possession, Seir, its enemies, also will be a possession, while Israel performs valiantly.    “One from Jacob shall have dominion, and will destroy the remnant from the city.  
“And he looked at Amalek and took up his discourse and said, “Amalek was the first of the nations, but his end shall be destruction.  “ And he looked at the Kenite, and took up his discourse and said, “Your dwelling place is enduring, and your nest is set in the cliff.    
“Nevertheless Kain will be consumed; how long will Asshur keep you captive?”  Then he took up his discourse and said, “Alas, who can live except God has ordained it?  Nu 24:15-23

In verse 17 we see the promise of the Messiah who shall be King of Israel coming forth from Jacob or Israel who will defeat the enemies of Israel.   This is a Messianic passage - this verse mirrors the blessing spoken by Jacob, as he lay dying on his bed, over his son Judah.  “The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet, until Shiloh comes, and to him shall be the obedience of the peoples.    Genesis 49:10   (Shiloh Means  ‘he whose it is,’  as such it is a Messianic title)

The wording used in verse 17 is almost the same when compared to Genesis 49:10. The main difference is in Genesis 49:10 we see the term Shiloh used and in verse 17 the term star is used. Some definitions, particularly the Strong’s, give a meaning of Messiah to the term star as it is used in this passage. In these prophecies of Balaam and Israel’s own prophet Micah we see Israel’s final triumph against her enemies.

“Then the remnant of Jacob will be among many peoples like dew from Yahweh, like showers on vegetation which do not wait for man or delay for the sons of men.   The remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, among many peoples like a lion among the beasts of the forest, like a young lion among flocks of sheep, which, if he passes through, tramples down and tears,and there 
is none to rescue.  “  Micah 5:7-8

The Prophet Micah gives us the hope of Israel.  The hope of Israel is the remnant to be kept for the day when Yeshua returns.   To keep the remnant of Israel safe Yahweh had to protect them from Satan.   He did so through a simple yet effective way.   He needed to punish Israel for their sins and at the same time He wanted to keep them safe from the evil Satan intended for them.   So He scattered them throughout the nations of the earth mixing them into the peoples around them.  

They are among the nations of the earth in all four corners of the earth.   He hid them in plain sight.   While punishing them on the one hand He protected them with the other.   Ephraim was seeded among the nations in a way different from Judah.   Judah was seeded in plain sight while Ephraim was planted deeper.   Now Ephraim is growing and coming into view but he needs Judah to help him find his way back.  Judah holds the scepter and the staff while Ephraim has the promise of the firstborn.   

Both hold a key role in the final restoration of the kingdom,  the firstborn of the firstborn sonship and the sceptre of the King.   

He prophesied about four periods of time:
*In the wilderness   23:7-10
*Their conquest of the land  23: 18-24
*Their greatness after the conquest  24: 3-9
*End of days  24:17-24

Rashi comments that the star represents a king and the sceptre is the power to overcome opposition and bring everything under subjection.  Balaam gets a peek into the future for Israel, he gets a vision of the Messiah of Israel in the form of a star with the scepter of power literally coming forth from Jacob and, perhaps the heavenly realm, and coming and crushing the very forehead of Moab.  This is a prophetic picture of the return of Yeshua when He will come forth from his temporary earthly absence at the right hand of the Father, to execute judgment upon the nations of the earth and the establishment of the Messianic kingdom.
Balaam prophesied that Israel would bring Moab under its control and all of Seth - that includes the rest of the world, as all are descendant of Seth.  His prophecy is profound an d far reaching in spite of the fact that he, himself, was a vessel unto dishonour.   The Septuagint identifies Agag (24: 7 -generic name for Kings of Amalek) with Gog of Ezek.38: 2.


&lt;u&gt;Balaam’s Treachery&lt;/u&gt;

Balaam’s hatred of Israel and greed overpowered his better judgment and although he had to admit that he could not curse the people of God, he devised another way to please Balak and fulfill the commission he had given him..  
Balaam saw the anointing and the presence of Yahweh upon Israel he realised that his power of divination to bring a curse would be useless and that another method would be necessary to succeed in his mission.  (Targum Johnathan XXIV)   

The Targum Onkelos  XXIV says  “And Balaam saw that it was appointed before Yahweh to bless Israel; and he went not as at those former times to inquire by divinations, but set his face towards the calf that the sons of Israel had made in the wilderness. (i.e. he set his mind toward the downfall of the Israelites with the idolatry of the golden calf) And B’laam lifted up his eyes, and beheld Israel dwelling by his tribes; and the Spirit of prophecy rested upon him from before Yahweh”  

The Torah tells us that Balaam went to go home afterward, but in Talmud, Sanhedrin 106a, the rabbis tell us that Balaam found a way to bring curses on Israel and counseled Balak to seduce the Israelite men into debauchery.   On his return from offering the sacrifices, when the spirit of prophecy had lifted from him, his evil heart directed him to regain the monetary favour that he had lost through not cursing Israel, and he gave Balak the counsel he needed to rob them of their strength and power with Yahweh from his knowledge of the incident with the golden calf at Sinai.  Balaam reasoned (rightly) that if they worshipped another god, they would be cut off from their source of strength and power in Yahweh God (Targum Onkelos XXIV). 

In the Targum of Johnathan we are led to understand that Balaam was encouraged in his mission to bring a curse upon Israel when he discerned that the tribe of Dan who took up the rear of the camp and was inclined to idolatry, therefore was not completely under the covering of the Cloud (Targum Johnathan XXIII),  thus leaving themselves open to the enemy.

The Gemara (Sanhedrin 106a) also says that Balaam advised Balak  “The God of these people hates immorality” and presented him with a plan to entice the Jewish people to commit harlotry with the women and with their god Peor, so that Yahweh would be angry and punish them. The episode related in the Torah about the relationship between the Jewish people and the daughters of Moav was a result of B’laam’s advice.  ( although scripture is brief on the details, Josephus, Philo and other writings give them)

The Aramaic Targums, Josephus, Philo and the Legends of the Jews all give the same account of the counsel he gave for the Moabite women to entice the men with appeals to their kindred link back to Abraham and the supposed intent of friendly relationships because of their common heritage.  They then invited them into their dwellings to eat their food and seduced them into worshipping their god Peor which involved nakedness and sexual relationships.   The men were led innocently into the initial deception and were overcome with this strategy of appeal to their lusts, and after eating their unclean food and drinking wine, they became inflamed with passion for these women.   Blinded to their motives, they succumbed to worship Peor and incurred Yahweh’s wrath and judgement.

Because of their open sin, Yahweh had them hung, at evening.  Even after this severe punishment, one of the men of Israel openly repeated this sin in the same way. Phinehas (mouth of the serpent) son of Eleazar (God is my help) ran the rebellious man through with a spear and saved Israel from the wrath of Yahweh.
“And, behold, a man of the sons of Israel came and brought to his brethren a Midianitha, before Mosheh and all the congregation of the children of Israel; and, behold, they were weeping at the door of the tabernacle. And Phinehas bar Elazar bar Aharon, the high priest, saw, and arose from among the assembly, and took a lance” and he thrust them through and by so doing, the plague that came upon them because of their sin, was stopped.   (Jerusalem Targum)


&lt;u&gt;The Downfall of Israel&lt;/u&gt;

Sexual immorality is the downfall of many who consider themselves to be strong and righteous. The enemy knows the weaknesses of the flesh and will do what he can to capitalize on them for our destruction.  Romans 13:14 says, “But put ye on the Master Yeshua Messiah, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.” What doors of immorality have you kept open in your life to gratify the immoral cravings of the flesh?  What spiritual stronghold exists in your life that the enemy can use to keep you under his thumb and from walking in joy and freedom in the will of God?  It is time to cry out to Yahweh for help and deliverance and to repent.

The women of Moab enticed the congregation with their hospitality, and their food and drink.  These inflamed the men with carnal passions which when aroused, before they would agree to satisfy their lust, they would take out of their robes the images of their god Peor and insist they worship them first.  In so doing they broke covenant with Yahweh and incurred His wrath.

The Midianites who were in league with Moab, on the other hand attempted to seduce the leaders of Israel, even Moshe himself unsuccessfully, but they did succeed with Zimri, the leader of the tribe of Simeon. Moshe and the elders were brought to tears in desperation knowing that there was no stopping them in their rebellion.  

Phineas the son of the new High priest rose up in righteous indignation at the flagrant sin of Zimri bringing the Midianite woman before Moshe and went and slew them in the act of their depravity.  This stopped the plague. Phineas, the priest, took a stand for righteousness and was commended for it.  We need to be priests of such character that we will put our lives and reputation on the line standing for righteousness against the forces of evil. (25:7)  Yahweh commands false prophets to be put to death (Deut. 13:5), and indeed, we read of Balaam’s death at the hands of the Israelites in Numbers 31:8.  Yahweh used Balaam to instruct Israel in His righteousness  (Mic. 6:5). Yahweh can use anyone, even a secular “prophet” or one’s enemy, to speak His words. Yahweh is sovereign, all-powerful and always in control of everything.

We lose our spiritual standing with Yahweh when we bow down to the gods of this world and the lusts of our flesh, even though it may be in the more subtle form of the goods and pleasures of this life and in the acquiring of them.

Balaam is the model of spiritual pride. He presumes to have God figured out. He supposes that He has a corner on truth and revelation. The story of Balaam is further evidence that it is possible to be utterly self-deceived about one’s relationship with God.  Balaam is like the patron saint of spiritual pride.  The Torah tells us that our ultimate goals must not be material wealth, glory or honor - and certainly not ill-gotten gain.  Rather, we are to put aside our own desires, and submit our will to God in order to better pursue our spiritual destiny.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I don't get the idea of a relationship.  You said it would have more than one answer in the answer set and and don't see how x-x or x*x can have more than one answer.

Yes, I agree, these are wrong. All eight should be functions as defined above (and below, where g(x) = x^2 is referred to as a function despite being called a &quot;relation&quot; here).</text>

:{{comment}} s/he has only done one edit; perhaps s/he's just bored. Can s/he be given another chance? [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 10:43, 11 August 2010 (UTC)
:[[Image:X mark.svg|15px| ]] '''Not done'''.  Please don't ask for a block for single edits.  Instead, please install the Twinkle warning gadget in [[Special:Preferences]] and give the person a warning, as I just have.  This allows for an attempt to encourage constructive contributions before smacking down on the block button. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:15, 11 August 2010 (UTC)
::The edit was clearly bad intentioned. Boredom isn't a justification to allow people not only to intentionally deface our work but to make it harder for us to detect it. To me that action was worth a block how long or what other solutions to apply is up for the administration to decide (I don't mind them being as benevolent as they like, I like that they have the time to be so). I don't make a fuzz in most ambiguous non-productive edits, even if repeated. This isn't one of those cases. Practice also demonstrates that unregistered users rarely interact with requests made to them, so any other measure will be at best palliative.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 12:37, 11 August 2010 (UTC)
:::IMO, making a bad-faith edit, no matter of what nature does not justify a block as long as the edit is not excessively ill-intentioned (eg. a user tries to blacken a certain person's name through Wikibooks). The purpose of blocking someone is because that someone's edits are posing a threat to Wikibooks. When a bored person vandalises in order to get attention, this does not mean he is some evil vandal who wants to destroy the project. We cannot confirm that he is persistent until he vandalises again after a warning.

::::I would share your opinion regarding registered users. I think registered users can be reasoned if they participate in a dialog, even demonstrated vandals (I have spent time in such actions before).
::::You are inferring that boredom is a valid reason to permit for people to take objectionable actions, I can't share this vision. They can with less efforts spend the time reading and fixing our works, this individual did make an effort to hide the vandalization. It shows not only bad intention but deception.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 13:34, 11 August 2010 (UTC)
:::::I cannot identify any element of deception in the edit. Please try to think like a silly child. Do you think a silly child deems it 'deceptive' to, say, modify his older brother's school essay a little bit? No, that's a practical joke. Clowning around is not deception.

::::::You are making assumptions, I read it differently. This is why blocking is mostly a judgment call even more since we don't have a block policy. I'm all for second chances and leniency and note that I not pushing for a block, I respect the decision of [[User:Adrignola]], that may require in a later date to followup on the decision by spending time and making an effort to educate the user and/or correct future edits. If it was I the one making the final decision I would perform minimum block and put the burden of any clarification on the user. I do think that treatment of unregistered user and registered ones should be a bit different, the latter have demonstrated a minimum of commitment to the project by performing the registration, note also that unregistered users are excluded from some processes by valid reasons (I've looked on the block policy draft and think that this should also be included there).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 15:20, 11 August 2010 (UTC)

== Insufficient permissions ==

I am one of the editors of the [[Radiation Oncology]] wikibooks. We have a page on [[Radiation Oncology/Vagina|vaginal cancer]]), which I want to split up into subpages (ala other cancers such as [[Radiation Oncology/Cervix|cervical cancer]].
What I envision is:
[[Radiation Oncology/Vagina/Staging|Staging]],
[[Radiation Oncology/Vagina/Overview|Overview]],
[[Radiation Oncology/Vagina/Treatment|Treatment]]
However, I get the &quot;Insufficient permissions&quot; block: &quot;The account or page name you have selected is inappropriate on English Wikibooks.&quot; Would one of the administrators be able to create these pages for me? It seems once the page is created (e.g. the original [[Radiation Oncology/Vagina|vaginal cancer]] page), I can then edit it fine. I believe the use of the medical term in this context is appropriate.

Please perform the unblock of Wikibookian Thekohser as expressed in the community discussion process at [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/General#Mike.27s_last_block_of_Thekohser|last block of Thekohser]]. A consensual decision since the two standing objections have no valid argumentation as they failed to provide any substantiation for their position (as requested).    --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:23, 21 August 2010 (UTC)

::My liking or not is not the point, if I did act solely on my own view point I would have brought the subject faster to the community attention, as I'm sure you remember, I objected to your interference as soon as you silenced the user on his talk page. I didn't act on my liking as you did, and my moderation in dealing with the situation demonstrates more tact that yours. In fact I had hopped by now that you realized what you have done here. Our community shouldn't be instrumentalized to pursue and realize private decisions. I think we have proven that you did not act within the community consensus and did actively violate our policies. Policies that every Wikibookians is required to enforce. I do however encourage you to pursue a resolution on the proper forums and execute the community decisions...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 22:47, 23 August 2010 (UTC)

::: As I hinted at in the Reading Room, I am personally unwilling to take action without a fresh discussion. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 13:36, 24 August 2010 (UTC)

::::What can rehashing the issue again alter to the fact that Mike has continuously violated our rules, the normal decision process, as he subverted the first steward's block, without consulting the community (as the steward required), the BeBold as he reverted Adrignola unblock (even after the community clearly indicated support for the unblock) and ultimately any reinforcement of the first block of the steward or new block on this user by a Wikibookian (that was why I asked in what function Mike was acting) is a clear violation of the [[Wikibooks:Administrators]] policy &quot;'''Administrators are expected to follow applicable policies concerning blocking users and IP addresses. &quot;Infinite&quot; blocks should not be employed unless specifically warranted. Legitimate users should not be blocked unless they are demonstrably disruptive to the community. If an admin blocks a legitimate user for no good reason that is a major disruption and a violation of this policy'''&quot;, the text is clear and cover this specific instance when it dictates that the target must be ''demonstrably disruptive to the community'' in fact by this policy Mike has been a cause of major disruption to the community himself, this started to become clear when he continues to intentionally make incorrect accusations or affirmations like above, about the user being &quot;banned on all WMF wikis&quot;, or starting shenanigans like the issue with the CU flags.
::::Can you envision any possible discussion that can be used to validate those issues, do you disagree with any of the points we have already brought forward and I resumed above, do you still defend that Wikibooks should replace meta in analyzing and censure users across projects ? Do you see the Wikibooks community as aware or interested about the antics people engage in elsewhere ? (there is precedence in my affirmation that we don't, an obvious reasons why we shouldn't, I will gladly discuss that point if you wish).
::::In fact not acting on the issue will undermine any legitimacy any admin has on implementing our rules.
::::The issue here is not the blocked user but the process, that he will be unblocked is guaranteed, unless we get a clear indication from WMF, delaying it will just make it take more time and permit the issue to fester on...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 15:58, 24 August 2010 (UTC)
::::: For what it is worth, when I read the above policy's you quote, I see no explicit violation. It is a very grey area in my opinion.  The question of whether or not a user should be globally locked user's account should be detached and unblocked is not clear. It is a resonable point of view that the global lock of a user is a does specifically warrent a local block, whether or not we agree with it.    
::::: I don't see any violation of be BeBold policy. Nothing says you can revert another users edit if you disagree with it, and Mike's reblock could be viewed in the same spirit.
::::: I don't personally feel wikibooks should replace meta.  In fact when push came to shove I am against detaching and unblocking, even in cases when I disagree with their methods.  One of the purposes of meta is to block cross wiki vandals globally, and I don't like second guessing them.  But I am sure I am more or less alone in this opinion.
::::: I can't speak on what the community feels about antics elsewhere.  Personally I do care, if the activities elsewhere are sever enough, and I am content to let meta handle the actual decision, as that is part of their scope.
::::: So the question might be why would I ever want a further discussion?  The answer is that I was not part of that dicussion, and I hope I might bring something new, or at least express my opinion.  
::::: Additionally I am not entirely content with the process that decided concensus for an unblock.  Did it really begin on the 9th and end on the 13th? We usually give at least 7 days from the last comment before we close an RfD.  This entire conversation took less seems to have take less than a week.  Did the community really have enough to to think about it and throw their their two cents in? I would not think so, but I am biased because it escaped my radar entirely. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 17:58, 24 August 2010 (UTC)

::::::The issue has been around since the first discussion I linked to on the other page, the one you were originally familiar with.  There's been plenty of time to think about it.  This isn't an RFD, it is a block that prevents someone from actively participating.  Blocks have been undone in shorter time than was taken in deciding to undo that block.  Let's examine the order of events.  1) Global lock by Pathoschild.  2) Removal of global lock by Pathoschild and local block implemented instead to allow communities to decide.  3) Readdition of global lock by Mike and a disabling of talk page editing.  4) Talk page editing enabled by Adrignola.  5) After a snowballing of comments supporting unblock with the last person to block (Mike) the only objector, Adrignola unblocks.  5) Mike then ''reblocks'' with comment &quot;banned&quot; and disables talk page access once again.  Check the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3AThekohser&amp;year=&amp;month=-1&amp;tagfilter= block log].  Be bold is a guideline and doesn't condone controversial actions and doesn't ever justify wheel warring.  The original block was as &quot;requested by Jimbo&quot; [http://en.wikiversity.org/?diff=54814] yet this was shown later to not be an office decision in the initial local block by Pathoschild: '''global lock changed to local block to let local community change it'''.  If the user is &quot;globally banned&quot; it's only because ''Mike reimplemented the global lock'' and now he's using that action performed by himself to justify the block here.  What was his reason for the global lock?  &quot;[http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=globalauth&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3AThekohser%40global&amp;year=&amp;month=-1&amp;tagfilter= per discussion].  As I said on the other page, stop with the back-channel discussions.  I want to see that discussion or it's '''invalid''' and has no bearing on local proceedings.  &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 18:50, 24 August 2010 (UTC)

:::::::It has been defended in past situations and I think it is on the draft of the block policy that a block should be first reconsidered by the one that executed it in the first place, I think that this is a reasonable request and would prevent situations as seen in the past and BeBold actions like Mike's attempt to prevent the user to request an unblock. I've been rereading what was said and I would like a clarification (as I don't know how to see when a SUL account has been locked and am not sure of the implications). Looking at the original account of  Thekohser I see several requests for unblock at the time I presumed that since they weren't signed that it was interference from others but after the recent discussions and by the claim made on the last request for unblock I get that all requests did come from the user and because of the SUL lock he even able to log in and not being yet blocked by Mike to edit his talkpage couldn't do so. Is this right ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:34, 24 August 2010 (UTC)  

::::::::It has been discovered that a globally locked user is able to log in and view their watchlist.  Only one request was placed on the talk page for unblock by the user, once the user was able to edit his talk page.  The previous requests were made by other users.  To determine if an account is globally locked, view the user's contributions page, scroll to the bottom, and click the SUL link.  If they are locked, it will say &quot;yes&quot; next to the &quot;locked&quot; line at the top of the page. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:59, 24 August 2010 (UTC)

:::::::::Ho. I thought that the SUL lock was the reason since in his last request for unblock he stated &quot;''Unblock request - 3rd attempt (from own User account)''&quot;. I was lead to understand that all requests did came from him and thought that the SUL lock was the reason he didn't properly sign the previous ones. By your reply I still don't understand. A user under a global lock can requests an unblock ? If not it clearly indicates that a global lock shouldn't target registered users as it would prevent a request for unblock even if the text states &quot;'''Global blocks should be placed with the lowest expiry possible, while still remaining effective. All global blocks should have an expiry.'''&quot;. I know that we locally can't do much about it and that the present situation is not normal (but it is a sufficient reason to include something in our future block policy) to help users and admins understand the situation created by a global lock as even Mike a steward himself demonstrated confusion about the process.
:::::::::One other issue is in regards to the backchannels, this isn't the first time people fail to comprehend the problem and danger of establishing outside of the community a &quot;small&quot; consensus that leads to the illusion that a given situation has been agreed upon and promotes intransigence based on mutual support. I don't think there is much that can be done to prevent the situation or think that the practice can be controlled, but it clearly has been demonstrated that it is a real problem, the best way to act on that regard is to publicly call participants to reason and publicly repudiate the practice, especially in dealing with situations that access to the discussion isn't public. Such communications also have a high probability of being impartial and promoted by one of the side involved in a dispute, records can't be guaranteed and verifiable. Wikibookians should avoid participating in such activities to address points of contention and in these cases even personal communications on those issues should be taken with a grain of salt. I don't think creating a guideline would be required but these facts should be often restated as to combat [[w:Groupthink|groupthink]]. If anyone has an opinion make it known to all, referenced to you and verifiable by all.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:13, 25 August 2010 (UTC)   

::::::&lt;small&gt;(edit conflict&lt;s&gt;, I haven't read the above post by Adrignola&lt;/s&gt;)&lt;/small&gt;
::::::Aah, but that is why I have gone to the effort of making clear to separate the issues on the previous discussions and to provide a clear order on how the issues should be analyzed (since they are a sequence of interconnected actions, one depending on the other, or even an accumulation of errors, that is how I see it).
::::::&quot;'''I see no explicit violation. It is a very grey area in my opinion.'''&quot;, how so? &quot;'''Legitimate users should not be blocked unless they are demonstrably disruptive to the community.'''&quot;, the user is registered and has complied to our local rules, he has made edits (contributed content) and never engaged in any disruptive activity ipso facto (by that very fact) he is locally &quot;unblockable&quot; as we don't have reasons to justify it.
::::::&quot;'''The question of whether or not a user should be globally locked user's account should be detached and unblocked is not clear.'''&quot;. The issue of &quot;global lock&quot; is outside of our control, the steward that acted to change the global lock into a local block, made it clear that it is up to us to block the user, the detachment and unblock has been validated by a community discussion that at the time it was going to be implemented was interfered by Mike, without any justification in a personal and unilateral decision as a Wikibook's admin (a violation of the proper use of the tools), the right solution, and in line with our guidelines was to respect the community decision (he had the chance to participate and was clearly aware of it). In fact Adrignola didn't require the backing of the community since we aren't bound by the &quot;global lock&quot; (you can't point me to any text that guides the process of detachment, except to the part that says that local admins can do it) it is an external decision processes, we can't accept any process that has a local impact but excludes the participation of our community, except a ruling by the WMF.
::::::&quot;'''Nothing says you can revert another users edit if you disagree with it, and Mike's reblock could be viewed in the same spirit.'''&quot; no it couldn't, because the community had already demonstrated that the user was wrongly blocked (we didn't perform any unblock action we were acting on the request of the Steward to validate locally his block), in fact Mike actions to alter the first block were the one covered by the BeBold but after the user requested the unblock of the sock puppet and then of the primary account, the process is guided by the normal decision process (as it constitutes a direct opposition to Mike's actions), after a comment by Mike and in light of the situation of no support for the block and a clear indication that Mike was abusing the tools, Adrignola performed a correction to the situation, correction that Mike unilaterally blocked not by a reversion (since the new situation is not the same as per the first block) but by performing again a new distinct block as the user is again prevented to writing on his talk page.
::::::&quot;'''I don't personally feel wikibooks should replace meta. In fact when push came to shove I am against detaching and unblocking, even in cases when I disagree with their methods. One of the purposes of meta is to block cross wiki vandals globally, and I don't like second guessing them. But I am sure I am more or less alone in this opinion.'''&quot; I don't think you are alone I do share the same vision and must of the people that discussed the situation seem to agree the global lock was abused, we even looked on the tool's history and past functions, it clearly wasn't created to be used like this. But again debating this should be done at meta.
::::::&quot;'''...I was not part of that dicussion, and I hope I might bring something new, or at least express my opinion.'''&quot;, &quot;'''I am not entirely content with the process that decided concensus for an unblock'''&quot;, &quot;'''This entire conversation took less seems to have take less than a week.'''&quot;. No one has yet prevented you to express your opinion or failed to provide you with a reply even if I still don't see the previous opinion about the users presumed actions as having an impact on the local processes. I see move validity on the points you are now raising (that have not yet been addressed), even if I don't see how they can be interpreted in any other way. You also made a mistake, you point to the events as an action to unblock the user, that is incorrect, since no local decision process validated the block in the first place there is no need for a process to unblock (much like the CU tools of Adrignola or if Mike decides to restore his own CU tools), what we have analyzed so far was if the first block had community support (it didn't) and if Mike's interference was correct (it wasn't). By these facts the only person that has been damaged by the situation is the user that remains blocked, as he hasn't been determined a danger to our project there was no reason to make his ordeal longer. You are again free to disagree with my option but it was clearly stated on the beginning post.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:42, 24 August 2010 (UTC)

:::::::I'm uncomfortably aware of having lost track of various points raised that, taken individually, I would have liked to reply to had I had time.  Here, though, are a few miscellaneous comments that come to mind.
:::::::* I agree with Thenub's suggestion that the unblock &quot;consensus&quot; process should have been longer.  Serious business warrants serious deliberation that should not be rushed.  Coincidentally, the days during which it happened were in a window of time when I couldn't get involved &amp;mdash; which only matters here in that it illustrates one reason ''why'' serious deliberations shouldn't be rushed.  I construe the situation as attempting to establish the will of the local community so that if/when some admin then chose to unblock they would have the weight of a local consensus behind them; and the discussion was not long enough to do that.
:::::::* The policy says that administrators should use their judgment.  It says that malicious users should be blocked, and when describing users that should not be blocked it specifically excludes users that are &quot;demonstrably disruptive to the community&quot;.  Quite independent of whether the word &quot;community&quot; should be construed in its narrowest possible sense in the context of this particular passage, the passage also does not pick nits about what sort of demonstration may be considered (nor should it; over-specificity would only create loopholes, to the detriment of... the community).  Apparently, what sort of demonstration is needed is also a judgment call.  Speaking of judgment and sorts of demonstration,
:::::::* an earlier remark by Adrignola referred to assessing Thekohser based on some other projects not liking him.  That was not the basis of my assessment.  Being disliked was never what I primary studied; I was more interested in what Thekohser had done and said.  If I'm inclined to give the benefit of the doubt to another Wikibooks admin's judgment that Thekohser is malicious and demonstrably disruptive to the community, it's not just because that judgment is shared by others elsewhere.

::::::::Are you aware of the time the user had been &quot;improperly&quot; blocked (since the Pathoschild correction clearly indicated that the solution needed clarification) and that the user created a sock puppet to contribute to the project. Did you noticed the first block action by Mike on the logs ? The situation has been under discussion long ago before I brought it to the general forum in 8 August 2010. Unblocking the user wouldn't be a &quot;serious business&quot; as there is no expectation he would perform any damage, in fact it would be proper to have started the process with the full participation of the user.
::::::::We are talking about a Wikibooks policy that guides Wikibooks administrators on Wikibooks blocks I think that interpreting community in any &quot;global&quot; way is unrealistic, even more if you take in the rest of the text.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:28, 25 August 2010 (UTC)
:::::::::You ''say'' that Pathoschild's actions were a &quot;correction&quot; when in fact they were a mistake. Thekohser '''is''' banned from all WMF projects. I don't know how to make that clearer. &amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;&lt;code style=&quot;color:#4B0082; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|mike]]@[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|en.wb]]:&amp;#126;$&amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt; 01:52, 25 August 2010 (UTC)

::::::::::&lt;s&gt;It would be proper for Pathoschild to correct his position on the subject or you as a fellow steward to remove the local block and restore the global lock, removing the burden of the decision from the local community. The user shouldn't be locally blocked that was already made clear.
::::::::::I also take the chance to point out that the text describing the global lock/block has several contradictions to the recent use given to it, in particular the time limitation. 
::::::::::Is Thekohser banned from Wikiversity ? The last information we got was that he had been unblocked there.
::::::::::Can you finally point out the location of the discussion that validated that &quot;global ban&quot; and the stipulation the makes us bound to that decision?
::::::::::Clearing those issues would indeed and as was already stated close the issue. Please use the thread below for the reply, that thread is covering the general process not the regularization of the local block.&lt;/s&gt;  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:16, 25 August 2010 (UTC)

:::::::::::By our own examination and by the reply I got from Pathoschild,  Thekohser  is not banned from all WMF wikis and the global lock tool was abused. Continuing to make the allegations to the contrary is not only misleading it is disruptive, if you don't have a declaration to the contrary by the WMF explicitly stating that Wikibooks must comply with that decision you should respect our community will and stop the disruption.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 15:28, 25 August 2010 (UTC)

:In context, it seems likely to me to have been intended as an exclamation of enlightenment, for which IMHO a more natural choice of letter sequence would have been &quot;Aah&quot; (or &quot;Aha&quot;, in a pinch).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 00:51, 25 August 2010 (UTC)
::Thanks, Aah seems right...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:55, 25 August 2010 (UTC)

:Fixed, my understanding is that Haa doesn't indicate laughter (and I can't believe you took that as my intention, especially in the context of this discussion). Ha, ah or Hah can mean laughter but not only that. I could have used Ha! but didn't, that  interjection I believe is a contemptuous reaction, and demonstrates disdain. It was an expression of &quot;You see, I had already thought about that point&quot;, it really was an error of translation nothing more.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:53, 25 August 2010 (UTC)   

=== An arbitrary break ===
Unless I'm not getting something:
# Drini/Magister Mathematicae locks Thekohser's global account 
# Pathoschild unlocked it and converted the lock into local blocks
# This meant that we could decide whether or not to ban Thekohser
# Mike.lifeguard relocks the global account &quot;per discussion&quot; (and doesn't link to the &quot;discussion&quot;)

:As we don't have a specific block policy all the rules we have for the action require that the user be locally disruptive. Since the original transformation to a local block was not a local decision by consensus we already took the steps to validate the block locally as per the request and contact made near Pathoschild (no consensus or if we discard the opposition of Mike as the argument is based on actions outside of our scope of intervention, a consensus not to validate the block).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:53, 25 August 2010 (UTC)

:This is indeed my impression of events.  It's a more concise version of what I wrote above.  What's happened between steps three and four is not clear. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 02:08, 25 August 2010 (UTC)

:Per [[meta:User_talk:Pathoschild#Unblock_proceedings_at_Wikibooks|Pathoschild  reply at the meta]], I got a clarification that the conversion of the global lock in a local ban was discussed and it was based in the realization that the use of a global lock as a tool to exert a global ban was not consensual.
:So the first error seems to be the Drini/Magister Mathematicae locks on Thekohser's global account as an action that failed to obtain consensus.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 15:12, 25 August 2010 (UTC)

My idea is that the IP is shared and the person that is doing the &quot;strange&quot; edits is aware of it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:41, 28 August 2010 (UTC)
:Yes, I concur - looks like a shared IP with a vandal hiding amongst more constructive contributors. The IP is registered to Indiana Department of Education and looking at the global contributions I see a typical school editing pattern (i.e., generally poor quality with many &quot;humorous&quot; edits).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Watering==
With limited space in a bonsai pot, regular attention is needed to ensure the tree is correctly watered. Sun, heat and wind exposure can dry bonsai trees to the point of drought in a short period of time. While some species can handle periods of relative dryness, others require near-constant moisture. Watering too frequently, or allowing the soil to remain soggy, promotes fungal infections and root rot. Free draining soil is used to prevent waterlogging. Deciduous trees are more at risk of dehydration and will wilt as the soil dries out. Evergreen trees, which tend to cope with dry conditions better, do not display signs of the problem until after damage has occurred.

==Repotting ==
[[File:Uprooted bonsai.jpg|thumb|upright|An uprooted bonsai, ready for repotting]]

Bonsai are repotted and root-pruned at intervals dictated by the vigour and age of each tree. In the case of deciduous trees, this is done as the tree is leaving its dormant period, generally around springtime. Bonsai are often repotted while in development, and less often as they become more mature.  This prevents them from becoming pot-bound and encourages the growth of new feeder roots, allowing the tree to absorb moisture more efficiently.

Specimens meant to be developed into bonsai are often placed in &quot;growing boxes&quot;, which have a much larger volume of soil per plant than a bonsai pot does. These large boxes allow the roots to grow freely, increasing the vigor of the tree and helping the trunk and branches grow thicker. After using a grow box, the tree may be replanted in a more compact  &quot;training box&quot; that helps to create a smaller, denser root mass which can be more easily moved into a final presentation pot.

==Tools==
[[File:Bonsai tools.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Set of bonsai tools (&lt;small&gt;left to right&lt;/small&gt;): leaf trimmer; rake with spatula; root hook; coir brush; concave cutter; knob cutter; wire cutter; small, medium and large shears]]

Special tools are available for the maintenance of bonsai. The most common tool is the concave cutter (5th from left in picture), a tool designed to prune flush, without leaving a stub. Other tools include branch bending jacks, wire pliers and shears of different proportions for performing detail and rough shaping.

==Soil and fertilization==
[[File:Akadama dry and wet.JPG|right|thumb|''Akadama'' soil]]

Bonsai soil is usually a loose, fast-draining mix of components,&lt;ref name=&quot;Soil&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norfolkbonsai.co.uk/default.asp?Display=39&amp;Title=Its-All-In-The-Soil |title=It's All In The Soil by Mike Smith, published in '&amp;#39;Norfolk Bonsai'&amp;#39; (Spring 2007) by Norfolk Bonsai Association |publisher=Norfolkbonsai.co.uk |date= |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070930023408/http://www.norfolkbonsai.co.uk/default.asp?Display=39&amp;Title=Its-All-In-The-Soil| archivedate = 2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; often a base mixture of coarse sand or gravel, fired clay pellets, or expanded shale combined with an organic component such as peat or bark. The inorganic components provide mechanical support for bonsai roots, and—in the case of fired clay materials—also serve to retain moisture. The organic components retain moisture and may release small amounts of nutrients as they decay.

In Japan, bonsai soil mixes based on volcanic clays are common. The volcanic clay has been fired at some point in time to create porous, water-retaining pellets. Varieties such as ''akadama'', or &quot;red ball&quot; soil, and kanuma, a type of yellow pumice used for azaleas and other calcifuges, are used by many bonsai growers. Similar fired clay soil components are extracted or manufactured in other countries around the world, and other soil components like diatomaceous earth can fill a similar purpose in bonsai cultivation.

Opinions about fertilizers and fertilization techniques vary widely among practitioners. Some promote the use of organic fertilizers to augment an essentially inorganic soil mix, while others will use chemical fertilizers freely. Many follow the general rule of little and often, where a dilute fertilizer solution or a small amount of dry fertilizer are applied relatively frequently during the tree's growing season.  The flushing effect of regular watering moves unmetabolized fertilizer out of the soil, preventing the potentially toxic build-up of fertilizer ingredients.

==Location and overwintering==
Bonsai are sometimes marketed or promoted as house plants, but few of the traditional bonsai species can thrive or even survive inside a typical house. The best guideline to identifying a suitable location for a bonsai is its native hardiness. If the bonsai grower can closely replicate the full year's temperatures, relative humidity, and sunlight, the bonsai should do well. In practice, this means that trees from a hardiness zone closely matching the grower's location will generally be the easiest to grow outdoors, and others will require more work or will not be viable at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;indoor_bonsai&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author= Pike, Dave | title=Indoor Bonsai | publisher=The Crowood Press | year= 1989 | isbn=9-781852-232542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outdoors===
Most bonsai species are outdoor trees and shrubs by nature, and they require temperature, humidity, and sunlight conditions approximating their native climate year round. The skill of the gardener can help plants from outside the local hardiness zone to survive and even thrive, but doing so takes careful watering, shielding of selected bonsai from excessive sunlight or wind, and possibly protection from winter conditions (e.g., through the use of cold boxes or winter greenhouses).

Common bonsai species (particularly those from the Japanese tradition) are temperate climate trees from hardiness zones 7 to 9, and require moderate temperatures, moderate humidity, and full sun in summer with a dormancy period in winter that may need be near freezing. They do not thrive indoors, where the light is generally too dim, and humidity often too low, for them to grow properly. Only in the dormant period can they safely be brought indoors, and even then the plants require cold temperatures, reduced watering, and lighting that approximates the number of hours the sun is visible. Raising the temperature or providing more hours of light than available from natural daylight can cause the bonsai to break dormancy, which often weakens or kills it.

===Indoors===
Tropical and Mediterranean species typically require consistent temperatures close to room temperature, and with correct lighting and humidity many species can be kept indoors all year. Those from cooler climates may benefit from a winter dormancy period, but temperatures need not be dropped as far as for the temperate climate plants and a north-facing windowsill or open window may provide the right conditions for a few winter months.&lt;ref name=&quot;bonsai_in_your_home&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author= Lesniewicz, Paul | title=Bonsai in Your Home | publisher=Sterling Publishing Company | year= 1996 | isbn=0-8069-0781-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pinchas-Phineas (Dark-skinned)  Numbers 25:10-30:1

The name of this week’s Torah portion directs us back to the final verses of Balak where in the opening verses of Bamidbar/Numbers 25, Pinchas is introduced in one of the most dramatic events recorded in the Torah.  Balaam has just made four consecutive prophecies over the children of Israel that all turned out to be blessings rather than Balak’s desired curses.  The last prophecy as chapter 24 concludes has a specific reference to the Messiah of Israel and the ultimate destruction of the nations who seek to destroy Israel. But for his own gain he gave the advice which was to be the downfall of Israel to lead them into harlotry with the women of Moab.

According to the narrative account (Numbers 25), while Israel was encamped in Shittim, the men of Israel engaged in immorality with the women of Moab.  This activity was linked to the idolatrous worship of Baal of Peor.  As a result God brought a plague on Israel in which 24,000 died.  The sin of Baal-Peor has to do with vile sexual rites

Parashat Pinchas, found in Numbers 25:10–30:1, begins with the story of how God commended Pinchas, the grandson of Aaron, for slaying an Israelite man for engaging in idolatrous fertility rites with a Moabite woman. Pinchas was exonerated for this killing because he was trying to safeguard the holiness of God and the holiness of God’s people. 


&lt;u&gt;The Ordination of Phineas to High Priest&lt;/u&gt;

Pinchas (Phineas) was a younger man who was being groomed to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather and father.  He was zealous for the things of Yahweh and had undoubtedly heard or perhaps even seen as a young child the dramatic execution of his uncles Nadab and Abihu when they offered up strange fire at the altar some thirty-nine years earlier.  He had observed his great uncle Moshe and his grandfather Aaron handle their responsibilities for years.  Now that his father was the High Priest, he was watching with great anticipation how the duties of the High Priest were conducted, because one day he would be given that great responsibility.  He was a man of the new generation that had risen up that was zealous for Yahweh and his truth.

Israel was in the process of being punished for their sin and Yahweh told Moshe to execute this judgement by taking the chiefs of the people, who had led the way into the sin of idolatry and participating in Moabite temple prostitution, and hang their dead bodies on display to all of Israel as a warning.  As Moshe and other leaders were carrying out this gruesome task, one chief had the audacity to flaunt his intentions of consummating a union (thereby assimilating) with the daughter of a Midianite chief in open view.  Pinchas took a spear and ran them both through with one thrust and in doing so committed an act of zeal for the glory of God.  As a result of this zealous act that brought an abrupt end to the debauchery, Pinchas was rewarded with a covenant of peace for himself and all of his future generations.   “Pinchas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned away My wrath from the sons of Israel in that he was jealous with My jealousy among them, so that I did not destroy the sons of Israel in My jealousy.  Therefore say, ‘Behold, I give him My covenant of peace; and it shall be for him and his descendants after him, a covenant of a perpetual priesthood,because he was jealous for his God and made atonement for the sons of Israel'”  Numbers 25:11-13). 

The Targum of Johnathan gives an enlightening account of this saying,   “Behold, I decree to him My covenant of peace, and will make him an angel of the covenant, that he may ever live, to announce the Redemption at the end of the days. ........behold, I will make him to possess the high priesthood; and because he took the lance with his arm, and struck the Midianitess in her body, and prayed with his mouth for the people of the house of Israel,”

In this act of zeal, Pinchas took no account of his own life in regard for personal consequences in killing these two people.  He could have been judged for premeditated murder and lost his own life as a result of his actions or else have been subject to acts of revenge by members of the tribe of Simeon.  However, for honouring Him, Yahweh Himself honoured Pinchas.  The Jerusalem Talmud records that the elders at the time did not approve of Pinchas actions and for that reason Yahweh vindicated him.

Years later we read other examples of men who were inspired by the Holy Spirit to do the will of the Father regardless of the consequences.  Men like Elijah, John the Immerser and the apostle Paul all come to mind as men who were totally sold out in their belief in the word of God and the instructions of the Holy One to His people Israel. 

Yahweh’s principle has always been to remove sin out of the midst of His people.   Sin corrupts the community of the righteous and therefore the wrongdoer(s) must be removed.  Sin, like leaven, in whatever form it comes, contaminates the whole group.   For this reason Paul warns the believers to beware of any root of bitterness amongst them which is spread by the tongue, drawing others into the same defilement of attitude and practice -  See Hebrews 12:14-17; 1 Corinthians 5: 6-8, 13.   Paul’s instruction was to put out from among themselves the wicked person.   To Israel as a nation living under Yahweh’s laws, the instruction was to put them out from this life as judgement upon them for their sin and so cleanse the community.   See Numbers 25: 5


&lt;u&gt;The Spoil and the Inheritance&lt;/u&gt;

Following the commendation of Pinchas, Yahweh spoke to Moshe and told him to go and “harass” the Midianites because of what they did to them.  The Aramaic Targums bring out strongly that it was a punishment for their act of harassing them without provocation.  “And Yahweh spake with Moshe, saying: Punish the Midianites and slay them, for they afflict you with their snares, with which they ensnare you; as by the occasion of Pheor, and by that of Kosbe, daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day of the pestilence in the matter of Pheor”.   (Targum Onkelos XXV)
Josephus says that they made a complete slaughter of the Midianites taking much spoil.  (Josephus Book 4 Chapter 7:1)  

The Midianites had joined the Moabites in the treachery against Israel being sister nations.
They kept the virgin women alive of the Midianites and after the necessary procedures of purification and separation were allowed to marry them and divide the spoils of war.
It was such a miraculous victory that not one man was lost in the war.  (31:48-49)  Ramban says that usually no one was lost in their wars in Moshe’s time when they were in right standing with Yahweh. (Munk op. cit. p.381)
As a result they came with a thanksgiving offering to Yahweh in the next parasha. (v.50)

In accordance with this a census is taken of all the men of war and which will establish the division of the Promised Land.


&lt;u&gt;The Census&lt;/u&gt;

Moshe is commanded to take of the remaining sons of Israel, and to deal with the case of families who do not have male heirs (Zelophehad)  The last census was taken 38 years previously at Mt. Sinai to assess them after having come out of the land of Egypt.  Now before they go into the land another census is required before he hands them over from being under his care to the care and leadership of Yehoshua.  An assessment was required for their future military projects in the land as well as for the distribution of the tribes and their inheritance in the land.  

Rashi suggests that there were two reasons for taking a census at this point.   Firstly, it is like a shepherd accounting for his sheep after the wolf has been through his flock and checking them over.  Also, the first census was when Israel was first handed over to his leadership at Sinai and now, at the termination of his ministry, before he hands them over to their new leader, he again counts them and surveys their passage through the trials and testings of the wilderness. (Rashi S.S.&amp; R edition p. 271)

This census showed that several tribes had lost entire divisions since the time that passed between the entrance of Israel into Egypt, and their entrance into the promised land.  Among the tribes that had perished were such as had already lost their lives in Egypt, those, namely, who had died during the days of darkness before the exodus because they were such sinners that they did not want to leave Egypt.  But heaviest of all were the losses in the tribes of Benjamin and of Simeon, for in the battle between the Levites and the other tribes after Aaron’s death, when the latter, for fear of the Canaanites, wanted to return to Egypt, the Benjamites lost no less than seven divisions.  All of the twenty-four thousand men that died from the plague at Shittim in regard to the sin with the Midianites, belonged, however, to the tribe of Simeon which, at the end of the march through the desert, had dwindled down to less than half its number.  The tribe of Dan, on the other hand, had turned out to be very fruitful, for whereas at the entrance of Egypt it had consisted of only one division, it later exceeded in number all the other tribes, excepting the tribe of Judah.   

“These are the families of the Shim’oni, twenty-two thousand two hundred.&quot;(26:14 HNV) - In Numbers 1:23, it is written,  “those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Shim’on, were fifty-nine thousand three hundred.” When we compare these two texts, we see that the tribe of Shimon had lost 37,100 men since the first census. It was seriously damaged by the plague, because its leader had made a breach through the sin with Kozbi, the Midyanite woman. 


&lt;u&gt;Moshe Gathered to his People&lt;/u&gt;

According to Yahweh’s decree, Moshe is not to enter the promised land and so at the fulfilment of the forty years, Yahweh tells him that his time has come and that he is to go up the mountain and die there.  
Most Jewish literature  records that Moshe was ascribed special favours from Yahweh on the day of his passing which is recorded as being the  seventh day of Adar, thirty days before the nation entered the promised land.  (thirty days would have been observed as a time of mourning for him)  It is believed that being prepared for the day of his passing, he set in order the scrolls he had written and the Torah, together with psalms he had written for each of the eleven tribes (Simeon excluded) which were later included with the rest of the psalms of the other patriarchs (Adam, Melchizedek and Abraham) with those of David and Solomon.

Mount Abarim, which he was told to ascend is one of the peaks of Mount Nebo.   Both Aaron and Moshe are taken from the people in the mountain heights not far from each other (27:12) just before entry into the land.  

Before he departs he prays for their spiritual welfare and for another to shepherd them.  “Let Yahweh, the God of the spirit of all flesh set a man over the congregation who may go out and go in before them, who may lead them out and bring them in, that all the children of Israel may not be like sheep that have no shepherd.”  (27:15-17)
Moshe does not make his own request of the one to follow him but leaves the choice to Yahweh.


&lt;u&gt;Appointment of Yehoshua as Leader&lt;/u&gt;

Moshe came before Yahweh and asked Him to appoint someone to lead Israel after his death.  His concern is that he does not want the congregation of Israel to become like sheep without a shepherd because Moshe knows that without a strong, God fearing, Spirit filled individual to lead Israel they will become like sheep who will wander this way and that with no idea of where they are going.   

When a shepherd takes his sheep to pasture, the sheep run ahead and he walks behind them with a stick.  He does this to keep the herd together and so that if they are attacked, it will be easier for him to flee and save his own life. Thus, a herd of sheep in the pasture can appear to lack a shepherd.  Moshe prayed to Yahweh to appoint a leader for the people, who would not walk behind them and keep a low profile, but one who would take the initiative and give direction, a leader, in short, who would always be a trailblazer for the people to follow.  The expression of “going out before them and coming in before them” is an idiomatic expression for being amongst the people as one of them, able to talk to them and give them leadership.

Moshe does not make any request for the succession of leadership, even though he has trained Yehoshua for that purpose, but submits the final choice to Yahweh for confirmation and approval.  Yahweh instructs Moshe to appoint Yehoshua his successor and to invest him ceremoniously with leadership: “And you shall put your honor/majesty upon him that all the congregation of Israel may listen. “  And so he does in the sight of all Israel.

Yehoshua was a man who had their respect, whose values they knew and who had faithfully stood alongside Moshe for the whole period during the wilderness.  He had lived before them and had thoroughly shown himself to them as steadfast and trustworthy to the commission and one of the three that remained who came out of Egypt,  the others being Moshe himself and Caleb.

Then Moshe spoke to Yahweh, saying,  “May Yahweh, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation,  who will go out and come in before them, and who will lead them out and bring them in, so that the congregation of Yahweh will not be like sheep which have no shepherd. “  So Yahweh said to Moshe,&quot;Take Yehoshua (Joshua) the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit,and lay your hand on him;  and have him stand before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation,and commission him in their sight.   “You shall put some of your authority on him, in order that all the congregation of the sons of Israel may obey him.   “Moreover, he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before Yahweh.  At his command they shall go out and at his command they shall come in, both he and the sons of Israel with him, even all the congregation. “  

Moshe did just as Yahweh commanded him; and he took Yehoshua and set him before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation.  23 Then he laid his hands on him and commissioned him, just as Yahweh had spoken through Moshe.   Numbers 27:15-23

Whereas Moshe had met “face to face” with Yahweh is His Presence, Yehoshua was to go through the ministry of the priesthood which would assume it full operation in the leadership of the nation in hearing from Yahweh.
And so, Moshe did as he was instructed and inaugurated Yehoshua into the leadership of the nation.


&lt;u&gt;The Appointed Times&lt;/u&gt;

Numbers 28–29: Yahweh warns Israel, “You shall be careful to present My offering…at their appointed times.” (28:2) Numbers 28–29 is an ancient priestly calendar, a detailed list of the prescribed Temple sacrifices for each festival day. The verses refer to the Sabbath day and the biblical festivals as moadim, i.e. appointed times.  They are Yahweh’s appointed times for meeting with man. They are also appointed times for sacrifice.  The sacrifices are to be performed in the temple and so today they cannot be performed, but we are still obligated to keep the appointed times.

The word translated as “careful” in Numbers 28:2 is the Hebrew verb shamar, the same word typically translated as “observe.” For example, the famous passage that says “the sons of Israel shall observe the Sabbath, to celebrate the Sabbath,” translates the same verb as “observe.” Thus we learn in this passage that we are to be scrupulously careful to keep the appointed times at the appointed times.   If we can make the appointment whenever it is convenient for us, then it is really not God’s appointed time.   They are to be kept at their ‘appointed times’.

The rest of this Parashah contains a summary of the sacrifices that all the people must present at the appointed times:

28:3-8::Daily, morning and evening
28:9-10::Weekly, each Shabbat
28:11-15::Monthly, each Rosh Chodesh
28:16-25::Annually, at Pesach and Chag HaMatzot
28:26-31::Annually, at Bikurim, Shavuot
29:1-6::Annually, at Yom Teruah
29:7-11::Annually, at Yom HaKippurim
29:12-34::Annually, at Sukkot
29:35-38::Annually, at Shemini Atzeret

In 28:1-8 the daily prayers and their offerings are listed.  The Chumash says the a quarter of a hin of oil and wine is approx. equivalent to one quart and a tenth of an ephah about two quarts of wheatmeal.

The times when the daily offerings were presented in the temple, together with incense, were the times when the people came to pray and these are still the times to come before the Eternal in prayer.
See Luke 1:10,   “The whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.&quot;
We see Daniel followed this practice even when exiled from the land when no sacrifices were being offered.  (Ch. 6:10)

“Offering by fire” - is repeated three times.  Yahweh is emphasizing the necessity of presenting the offerings with fire.  Our dedication must be accompanied by a heart that is on fire in order to be a pleasing aroma to Him.  (28:3, 6, 8 )

The same thing applies with the drink offering. The wine was not to be burned up on the fire. Therefore there was a canal on the side of the altar where the wine was poured before the Eternal as a drink offering.  However, the wine had to be “burning”, i.e. fermented. The Torah commands that the drink be strong, intoxicating, in Hebrew “shechar”, (Strong H7941 she^ka^r, shay-kawr’, From H7937; an intoxicant, that is, intensely alcoholic liquor: - strong drink, + drunkard, strong wine.)   see verse 7. 

Wine has gone through a fermenting process and is more “burning” than grape juice.  This is necessary in order for it to be pleasing as a drink offering.  Here we find the same principle as with the offering by fire.  There must be fire in our hearts when we pray in order for our prayer to be pleasing before Yahweh God.  This teaches us that prayer without kavanah, a clear intention, is useless and will not ascend to heaven as a pleasing aroma.  Let us come before Yahweh with burning, passionate prayers!

One who gave an animal to be sacrificed in the temple had to be present while it was slaughtered. However, when the sacrifices for the whole people of Israel were presented, all the people could not be present. Therefore, groups of Israelites who could represent all the people were appointed, and they were present during the sacrifices. Just as there were twenty-four groups of priests and Levites who took turns in the ministry, there were twenty-four groups of Israelites, both of the inhabitants of Jerusalem and of all the other cities in the land, who took turns to come into the temple and be present during the offerings that were given for the whole people.

When Yeshua came He taught them to come back to the course that had begun at Mount Sinai.  He wanted them to return to Torah as Yahweh had given it to Moshe and Moshe had given it to the people.  Yeshua wanted Israel to turn back to Him as their first love and then to Torah.  This is what Moshe desired when he asked God to appoint a leader who could lead the people after him.  This has always been at the heart of God’s desire.  His desire could not be fulfilled through the men Israel chose but it would come to pass through His anointed heir, His Son, Yeshua.  He would be the Shepherd who will finally lead Israel in unity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mattot

The word ‘Mattot’ means “staff”.  A staff is inactive, inert and incapable of changing and bringing forth new life.  It symbolises the authority of Yahweh - in Moshe’s hand it opened the sea, gave victory over the Amalekites, brought water from the Rock.

The Parashah concerns three things primarily: 
*Vows (Num 30), 
*War with Midian (Num 31), and 
*the Tribes who settled in the Trans-Jordan (Num 32).  

These episodes revolve around two elements: the responsibilities of the tribal chiefs, and the importance of keeping one’s promise. It is for this reason that the Torah introduces this section with the laws of vows, which are first addressed to the tribal chiefs  


&lt;u&gt;The Question of Vows&lt;/u&gt;

Moshe begins the Mattot portion with a short and  concise teaching about vows and oaths for males and how Israel is to handle the potential problem that develops when young girls and women make vows that have not been approved by their spiritual covering.  A vow/neder is literally a pledge to do something.  It places upon oneself or others or upon objects of one’s choice, a status equivalent to that of a commandment of the Torah (AS Stone Edition Chumash, p. 900).   One’s word is one’s bond.  A neder is so strong that a person violating it could suffer the court-imposed penalty of lashes according to the Chumash. 

The Holy One of Israel is not a man that he should lie (Num. 23:19).  If we are to be set-apart/kadosh as he is kadosh (1 Pet. 1:16; Heb. 12:14; 1 Pet. 2:9) we must be people of our word not only in large matters, but in the smallest of matters, too.   We need to be careful not to be too casual with our words and make commitments without the serious intention of fulfilling our obligations. Yahweh is very clear when He instructs us on how to behave when we make a vow or we formally obligate ourselves to someone else.  He is not to break his word and is to do all he said he would do.  Liars will have no part in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:8).   

We as believers can take covenant too lightly. We rely on redemption and atonement too easily and forget our obligations to those we have entered into covenant with. Covenant, ‘brit’ in Hebrew, implies the spilling of blood in the act of the consummation of the covenant.  Covenant is also forever. I do not think that it is by chance or grammatical coincidence that the start of this portion is addressed to men.   In this section we see that Yahweh establishes order in the family structure. The man, as the head of the family, holds veto power over promises made by those under him in his family.  That is because the husband and/or father holds responsibility for promises made by those in his family (Numbers 30:15)   Men as the priests and heads of the home and family unit are responsible, by virtue of the covenant they have with their wives, for the success and failure of that relationship.

Every marriage, covenant, wedding or union is witnessed by Yahweh in heaven. Two people cannot have a relationship in the physical without Yahweh being witness to it. The Brit Chadashah is clear on how men and women need to relate to one another. (Eph.5:22-33)  We are to love each other as He has loved us.  If husbands are to have their wives submit to them and to the leadership they are to exercise, they are to love them as Messiah loves the kehilah (congregation) of believers. If men are to expect their wives to be subject to them, as they are to Yahweh, they need to fulfill their responsibilities as husbands and these include giving themselves up (denying themselves in whatever way Yahweh may lead) that they may be holy.  A husband is to cleanse his wife by washing them with the Word!  

We too are to love our wives as we love our own bodies, this in a way of self respect and nourishment and not in self worship.  In this way, when the two become one flesh, the covenant will be upheld.  If any other practice is at hand, the covenant will not stand and we as husbands will have to answer to Yahweh.

For men it is a straightforward commitment to keep one’s word  -  If you make a vow, fulfill it.  The situation for females is different.  They can make a vow and have it undone by their father or their husband.  If the husband or father hears of the vow, he can either affirm it or cancel it as he sees fit.  If he does not negate it at the time she first told him, then it stands and can’t be annulled.  This ruling does not limit or “put down” women as much as it protects them from the consequences of bad judgment.  

Look at verse 15  -  the man bears a consequence to his responsibility if he makes a vow null and void after he has heard it,  he will bear the consequent guilt. Scriptures like these have been used to show that men are “in charge” and that women can’t even make a decision for themselves.  Perhaps the better lesson here is to realize that men will bear the guilt if we get in the way of wives’ righteous plans.  

Chapter 30 is devoted to addressing these issues and for those who are today trying to claim the equality of the sexes, for Israel at least, there are some very specific instructions on how to deal with misspoken vows and oaths that usher forth from the daughters and wives of Israelite men.  Interestingly, if you read these verses, then you will be able to understand some of the words that the Apostle Paul wrote concerning the role of women in the assemblies of the set apart people of the Holy One of Israel.  For those men who are blessed with godly, women, these words can be misconstrued.  But for those of us who are learning Torah, interpreting what Paul was saying seems to make a lot more sense.  We know from further revelation, from Paul in particular, that the women are supposed to concentrate on teaching the other women and younger women of the assembly.   

Some women have difficulty with these words and the interpretation of them, especially if they are the spiritual leaders of their respective households.   Without getting into the details, suffice it to say that when Moshe was writing his words in this parenthetical statement in chapter 30, he was reflecting the norm of the society in which he lived.  The men of ancient Israel were the heads of their homes.  They were in charge of the responsibilities that came with headship.  

Paul enjoins married men to “love your wives and do not be embittered against them.” (Colossians 3:19)  The Bible never commands husbands to “make your wives submit to you.”  
The mitzvah (command) of submitting to one’s husband belongs solely to the woman.  It is the wife’s mitzvah, not the husband’s.  A husband need not fret that his wife is not submissive to him. That is her responsibility before Yahweh, not his.  (Ephesians 5:22–23)  His responsibility is to ensure that he loves her and fulfill his responsibilities to her as Yeshua does to His Body of believers.   If he does that it should be a joy for a woman to submit to him.   

The biblical husband is to nourish and cherish his wife. One cannot cherish a person and at the same time bully and force her into submission. Messiah-like headship is defined as servant-hood. Lording it over another person is something that the Master ascribes to the ways of the pagans. (Matthew 20:25–28)
The scriptures do not give a man license to force his wife to obey him.  Instead, he is to love her and treat her as “a fellow heir of the grace of life.”  She is his partner, not his servant.  Peter says that a brutish, authoritarian man who does not show his wife the dignity of being his “fellow heir” and live with her “in an understanding way” is not worthy of even having his prayers answered. (1 Peter 3:7)  After all, he does not listen to his wife’s entreaties, so why should Yahweh listen to his?

In Titus Paul encourages the young married women to “to love their husbands, to love their children, to be sensible, pure, workers at home, kind, being subject to their own husbands, so that the word of God will not be dishonored.” (Titus 2:4–5) Shimon Peter also instructs married women that they are to “be submissive to your own husbands,” (1 Peter 3:1) even if they are unbelievers. The biblical position on family order is unanimous.  The husband is the head and he bears the responsibility for that.

This portion of scripture teaches us the principle of authority and submission:
*A man is under the authority of the leaders, 30:1-2.
*A young woman is under her father’s authority, 30:3-5.
*An adult unmarried woman is under her father’s authority concerning the annulling of promises, 30:3-5.
*A betrothed woman is under her husband’s authority, 30:6-8.
*A widow or a divorced woman does not have any direct authority over her that can annul her promises. However, she is under the authority of the leaders, just as the men are, 30:9, compare with verses 1-2.
*A married woman is under her husband’s authority, 30:10-15.


&lt;u&gt;East of the Jordan&lt;/u&gt;  Bamidbar/Numbers32:1-7

“‘Now the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad had an exceedingly large number of livestock.  So when they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead, that it was indeed a place suitable for livestock, the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben came and spoke to Moshe and to Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the congregation, saying, Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon,Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and Beon, the land which Yahweh conquered before the congregation of Israel, is a land for livestock, and your servants have livestock. '  They said, ‘If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants as a possession; do not take us across the Jordan. ' But Moshe said to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben, ‘Shall your brothers go to war while you yourselves sit here? Now why are you discouraging the sons of Israel from crossing over into the land which Yahweh has given them?'” 

When Reuben and Gad saw this fine, fertile land outside of the land that had been promised to all Israel, they wanted to stop and take it for their inheritance.  Moshe was angry at them at first but later agreed, provided they would help their brothers take the Promised Land.  Moshe suspected them of choosing the comfortable easy way in desiring what the whole army had already conquered.  He is also concerned that it will discourage the others from crossing over into the land Yahweh had given them.  They had already conquered the cities of this region. Yet the other tribes had war ahead with the Canaanites.  Moshe did not want these tribes to fail to do their part in that war.

What does this represent or mean for us today?  All too often, when Believers are going about their lives, they get to a point where they are comfortable where they are and they want to stop and take their inheritance.  Or, they are satisfied with the perceived “spiritual rewards” that they are receiving and they are not willing to go further in their faith.  Reuben and Gad did not really want to go “the extra mile” and wanted to take as an inheritance land that Yahweh had not promised them. Reuben and Gad did not really want to go and help their Israelite brothers, but eventually had to when Yahweh said that the land would only be theirs if they did so.  
A prime example of “staying put” includes those who do not wish to obey the Torah.  There are people who are “comfortable” in their walk of faith, and they do not want to make any changes.  They are unwilling to admit that they might be wrong with how they practice their faith.  Such individuals often have, whether they realize it or not, a stagnant faith that is not growing.  They are often not maturing and moving forward.  


&lt;u&gt;Moshe’s Passing&lt;/u&gt;

Yahweh informed Moshe to prepare himself to leave this life and he gathered the congregation together at a place which bore the named “Abila” near the Jordan,  according to the Book of Jasher,  and there he counselled them and exhorted them and gave them the laws and constitutions of government and social ethics written in a book.  He also instructed them to build a temple after they had defeated their enemies and the land was in peace.   It was at this time that he foretold the destiny of each tribe in the latter days and gave to each of them his blessing.  They were greatly distressed at the thought of losing him and his oversight that had been over them through the many trials and difficulties of the journey, and he was comforted at their appreciation of him.   Taking leave of them he went up the mount Abarim which is over against Jericho together with the leaders and the elders, and left them.  As he ascended up into the mount a cloud descended and removed him from their sight.  (Jasher Chapter 8)

The nation mourned him for thirty days and then under Joshua’s leadership went forward to conquer the land.

The blessings Moshe prophesied over the Tribes: 

Joseph for his commitment to the will of God and also because as king of Egypt he treated his brothers with high honors although they had thrust him from their midst.   For that reason he said “so shall little Joseph’s sons be yoked into service by the empires; as the unicorn with his horns pushes away all other animals, so, too, shall Joseph’s sons rule the nations, even to the ends of the earth.”

Zebulun was the tribe that before all the other tribes devoted itself to commerce and providing for the nation, and in this way acted as the agent between Israel and the other nations, and so he said, ‘Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out’ on commercial enterprises; at thy instance shall many nations pray upon the sacred mountain of the Temple and offer their sacrifices.”; One other blessing of Zebulun was that it would always be victorious in battle. 

Issachar, closely bound up with Zebulon, was blessed by its distinction in the “tents of learning.” For Issachar was “the tribe of scholars and of judges,” wherefore Moshe blessed them, saying that in “the future time,” Israel’s great house of instruction as well as the great Sanhedrin would be located in this tribe;  

Gad, dwelling on the boundary of the land of Israel, received the benediction that in “the future time” it would be as strong in battle as it had been at the first conquest of Palestine, and would hereafter stand at the head of Israel on their return to the Holy Land, as it had done on their first entrance into the land;  
Dan, who like Gad had his territory on the boundary of the land, was also blessed with strength and might, that he might ward off the attacks of Israel’s enemies;     

Naphtali’s blessing read: “O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, and full with the blessing of the Lord: possess thou the west and the south.” ..  ..  But Naphtali was blessed not with material blessings only, but also with spiritual; for it was the great house of instruction at Tiberias to which Moshe alluded when he said of Naphtali, “he is ‘full with the blessings of the Lord.'”;  

Asher was called the favorite of his brethren, for it was this tribe that in the years of release provided nourishment for all Israel, as its soil was so productive that what grew of its own accord sufficed to sustain all ..  ..  “The treasures of all lands shall flow to thee, for the nations shall give thee gold and silver for thine oil.”  He blessed Asher moreover with many sons, and with daughters that preserved the charms of youth in their old age.

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Chapter III: Village Life around Rosalie Cottage====

Tatworth village shared shopping facilities with South Chard and Chard Junction:[If you look upon a map you will see Tatworth,Forton and Chard Junction have equal standing; In lesser form Perry Street and South Chard, come within their orbit - to the south. All these places, and indeed others, were just a few cottages strung out along the road or track, and are today within the Borough of Chard]. For provisions these all came within the sphere of Stoneham’s Store - that provided all the needs of the villages, including the newspapers. The fresh fish man came to the village on Fridays - catering for all - especially the strictly religious, Bradford’s warehouse, near the station, sold all sorts of farm implements and an assortment of ironmongery, whilst Fowlers animal feed, provided the chicken’s with their corn. By turning right, out of the garden gate to Rosalie Cottage… pass the Village School on the left, you eventually arrive at Lacombe’s Store  [ It was Ken Larcombe, the saw sharpener, who married mum’s younger sister Ivy]. The store - close by the Baptist Chapel, provided my brother and me, with our sweets –  at a penny a bag… which by, taking it in turn to choose the days’ selection, prevented arguments lasting all the way home. The gobstoppers and stickjaws came from large colourful glass jars, placed on numerous shelves around the walls... the better sweets, costing tuppence… weighed-out… on antique brass scales, and proffered in cone shaped paper bags…, set the scene for another day's series of adventure.

Turning left however, takes you over the bridge and up the road - which leads to ‘Crossways’ – a name given to the meeting of several roads forming a five pointed star.  In the centre of the road, an imposing fir tree, similar to that planted in the churchyard, to commemorate Queen Victoria’s Jubilee 1887. The doctor’s house rested on one corner… a large imposing house, which was named after the place. The most frequented hospital was the local cottage hospital where doctors, reluctant to send their poor patients - saved them their hospital fee. The cottage hospital set broken bones, attend to all minor operations and dispensed potions and cure-alls. The Post Office and Wellington’s Stores supported two further corners of the star… whilst on another; an orchard enticed us lads to scrump apples. Two farms, both with their own dairy, supplied the dairy produce to the village. Board &amp; Son, the butcher, slaughtered their own pigs, delivering by Hackney - pony, and smart high dogcart… took orders twice a week and three times closer to Christmas. The baker baked their own bread, which they too delivered by cart. Shopping for larger household items: clothing, materials, furniture and kitchen utensils meant a trip into Chard by horse and carriage, later there was a bus service, which allowed smaller items to be carried too. 

What motor cars there were in 1935 all had an interior of upholstered leather with carpeted floors; plaited silken hand straps, plated ashtrays and polished wood dashboards…? Many built with an open top, able to be covered with an erectable hood, with mica windows, called an open-top tourer. Although they had starter motors the battery was often too low on amps to turn over the engine, especially in cold, wet weather… thankfully all were provided with a starter-handles - tied up with a strap. When starting from cold the choke [butterfly valve in the carburettor used to stop the flow of air] had to be pulled out. Frequently this tended to return to the open position so had to be held out. This proved to be almost impossible if you were on your own and had to turn the engine over by hand… it was then a question of who could turn over the starting handle and race round the car before the choke went back. The battery was kept on the running board as was petrol can and a spare wheel. When travelling up a steep hill it was important not to stall the engine when changing gear for the hand brake was not strong enough to stop the car from rolling back. A block of wood in the back was kept handy for such occasions. As there were frequent, fogs the windscreen was kept fully open to see the road ahead. This meant for a very cold journey.

The roads and lanes were ditched regularly to drain the fields... many having their own spring and watercourse - to carry away the water to brook… stream and river. Most of the vehicles passing over the bridge travelled at the pace of the horse and cart. In the meadows, further down-stream – towards the Combs’s – where the sheep graze as they will in the hollows on the hill-side, the spring waters irrigate withy and osier-beds - the produce of pollard willow trees that provided the village with materials for green and brown – with or without bark: wands, switches, rods, poles and staves.

The edges of the bank are not clearly defined, the verdant growth of rich tufted grass soften the edges and provide a haven for the dragonfly. Here and there, is stunted and broken willow leaning over the water trailing their slender arms that causes the water to divert and reform? Rushes grow in clumps, which give colour, and diversity separates the decayed branches from weed and lily. The chaffinches and sparrows abound for they perch in their dozens chattering away giving a sharper top register to the drone of bee and click of the cricket. The ducks dabbled… to suddenly plunge tails-up to feed from the weed… or stood, on one leg, to appear asleep… made soporific by the sun.  
 
Although the willow provided the villager with osier and withy the fields and roadside hedges contributed most for hedging stakes, fence poles and hurdles. The rich crowns of chestnut, hazel, ash and willow in the lanes tell of past harvests by itinerant Gypsies, bodgers, basket makers and woodworkers… whilst the stick maker eyes the furze, debating its worth. Each piece of woodland known locally for its special use. Birch twigs as strainers, split Beech for tent and clothes pegs, and hewn for chair seats; Larch for ladder poles, Oak for staves, Ash for hurdles, Hazel for wattle, Ash and Elm for wheels; all these were known - where they grown and how accessible.   Further away - behind the hills and valleys, the fallow deer graze, their young calling to their mothers… sounding like the cry of gulls… their fathers - the stags, round up their hinds, burping and grunting like pigs!

Over the bank, that bordered the stream… and into the field - abundant with wild flowers, the damp tufted grass wetted our knees and soaked our socks and shoes. There grazed the bull - its nose ring green and wet… guarding the tea-plate sized mushrooms … that rewarded the brave early birds...!During our summer holidays, my brother and I would go mushrooming with either Aunts Ivy or Florence [Florence was grandmother’s sister married to Uncle Wilfred in 1945… the same year Ivy married Ken Larcombe] Ivy and Ken lived over the road in White Cottage, next to the school… their daughter was tragically killed in a cycling accident, when a teenager.Back at the cottage mother would be helping grandma with the preparations for breakfast. The results of our gatherings were taken from the trug to be eaten. 

Cottages in 1935, had no cookers, as we know them today, fridges, washing machines, lights or electric heaters. There was no indoor sanitation, main drains, bathrooms or toilets; no tissue paper, gas or telephones, few cars… no aeroplanes, no plastic materials: building blocks, composition wood, and no masonry drills. You had your dwelling but no services. The water was from the well or brook, heating was by oil, lighting by candle, and transportation by horse.

Later in the day: mother would take us gleaning - corn for the hens; picking damsons, greengages, blackberries, and apples from the hedgerows - for grandma to cook for dinner; then later on in the year cob nuts were collected to be dried ready for cracking at Christmas. We always had a slice of bread and butter with the pudding instead of custard or cream. In some instances, the tart was eaten before the main course to dull appetites.

The garden, corralled within the four-foot, knapped flint wall – that flanked the road… gave space for three plots - one for each of the cottages. All held neatly grown vegetables, and flowers for the house… the varieties always are the same: larkspur, pinks, sweet-williams, wallflowers, hollyhocks, London pride and lilies. It was the wife’s preservers to look after and plant the flowers for cutting. 

The cottage gardens, at the turn of the twentieth century - in all country villages, did not boast a lawn, for the inhabitants had to make maximum use of the ground they had. Mowers were after all too expensive and considered a luxury. Perhaps there may have been a patch of grass, cut by a scythe or grass-hook that graced below the washing line, a play area for the children - where mother parked the pram, with the sleeping child… The kitchen garden plots, for this was really what they were, became very fertile, through much labour over many years, plus: an annual dressing of swept chimney soot, a frequent scattering of road and field manure, and applications of well-composted kitchen and garden waste… the result being ‘finely textured and black’.

Many of the village cottagers were farm labourers earning perhaps £1.50 per week. It was almost impossible to maintain a family on such a low sum. That is why these gardens had to be productive. Their narrow cinder paths flanked by brick or tile. The man of the house worked the productive side of the garden, it was his job to see that a further crop was possible - by ensuring correct composting followed on after each harvested crop. Most of the villagers were in competition with each other to see whose plot was the most productive… this did not prevent seeds being exchanged or given away and cuttings passed on. Digging and sowing went on late into the evening making use of every moment…

In unison, the runner beans canes were formed ‘in line’, the onion sets proudly flew their flags of browning leaves and the earthed-up potatoes - perched on top of pin-neat banked rows, again, marching in serried ranks, just behind bushes of red and black current, gooseberry and wired raspberry canes. All these dietary delights were hemmed in, by a neatly cut, eighteen inches high box hedge. Even today, I cannot pass box without that scent reminding me of granddad’s garden - a picture of neatness and colour… Although the family had very little money, the garden landscape and ordered existence, declared continuity, rustic comfort and bucolic charm.

The possession and upkeep of a good vegetable plot - that produced vegetables all the year round, made good economic sense… that it will also form a creative pastime, an essential part of rural life. Necessary digging and planting regulated every month of the year – Seeds had to be ordered and the ground prepared. Every part of the country, county and town had its own special produce - those things that grow best. You have only to look around at neighbouring plots and hedgerow to see what flourished. It is far better to ask established gardeners what fruits best, and when to plant out. Eventually you too will be an expert - on your particular plot. Do not forget, the greenhouse and cold frame are necessary adjuncts to any vegetable garden… for it saves money, labour and time to prepare your own seedlings… At the end of each growing cycle, a selection of each vegetable should be set aside - to provide seeds for the following year… cutting, dividing and layering would also multiply your stock. This sound advice was followed and advocated by my granddad… one of his daily topics of conversation; the only other, was a comment on the weather that, whatever the barometer declared, ‘Was detrimental to good health and sound crops…’

Looking out of the front door - to the right, just behind the privy, lies a small orchard - bearing desert apple, pear and plum… each contributing their own delicate blossoms in late spring – before the bulk of the flowers display their blooms – each to their part in the flowering season. Up against the garden wall, hidden by the trees, the compost rots… those parts the chickens fail to peck… The garden provides vegetables and fruit for the whole year… augmented by the fruits of the hedge.

Chicken runs take up the bottom of each plot, fenced off with wire, to keep the fox at bay - the nesting boxes built-up to form a backdrop to each garden end backing onto the stone boundary wall, which separated the street and side lane, from the garden. Most people in the country kept chickens. Special containers were kept in the kitchen, or just outside, for the hen food. They were fed twice a day once with corn and once with all the meal leftovers. The grit, to keep the yolks and shells strong, was to be found by the hens from the ground. The eggs were collected in a bucket from the straw filled nesting boxes each morning. Fresh straw lined the boxes to keep the eggs from breaking and to give the hens a nesting bed. Most popular breeds were White Leghorns and Rhode Island Reds. A cock bird was in charge of the flock otherwise the eggs would not be fertile. All the other cocks would be penned up and fattened for eating. Sharing the chicken run was a duck. It made no difference to the chickens who continued to cluck and scratch around in their dust holes. The duck, which happened to fly down one day and liked what he saw, waddled about seemingly unaffected by a different breed. He washed in the chicken’s water bowl and ate the same meal. Eventually, I am sure, he thought he was a chicken… stayed there for as long as I can remember. 

Rosalie Cottage had the largest share of the garden for it was the end cottage and the boundary wall circled around the line of privies – one for each property – all faced south. Each privy had a wide, scrubbed, wooden seat on top of the box, with the closet running to a cesspit. The latched, ledged and braced, door was short at the top and bottom to aid ventilation and the interior walls were lime washed. Strung on string were neatly torn leaves of newspaper - to act as toilet paper. High up in the corners were large cobwebs that were home to, what seemed to my childish imagination, enormous hairy spiders. Bricks had been laid on compacted bare earth, which, over the years moss had grown in the joints, made the floor soft to walk on. A bucket was kept handy to pour down the hole - each user had to fill the bucket from the stream for the next person. In the winter, a hurricane lamp was kept by the backdoor for lighting the way. Outside the privy grew an elder to help keep the flies away… a sprig of elder was also used for horses, for the same reason, and kept under the horses’ bridle. Country sanitary arrangements included at that time using pail-closets, ash-boxes, ashbins, midden-privies and wet and dry middens. It was not until the 1950s that all these simple arrangements began to be replaced with flushed closets.

The lichen and moss pointed brick path from the front-gate continues right round the house, past the wide, solid front door and the espalier trained pear-tree, to a door in a lean-to workshop and wood-store. On the other side of which, separated by a wall, is the kitchen. In the lean-to was to be found all the necessary garden tools, baskets, bicycles, stacks of firewood and in pride of place my granddad’s military helmet. The shed held Harry’s grandfather Phillip’s shoe mending, iron-trees, embedded in large tree stumps… and still used, and the winter fruit store with boxes of newspaper wrapped apples.

In the autumn, the outhouse was cleaned and the pickling jars washed and sterilised. Eggs, put-down in Isinglass, walnuts hodded, dried and stored, apples and pears wrapped in newspaper, root-vegetables stacked and covered with straw and beans placed in salt. Herbs dried, soft fruit made into jam, tomatoes pickled and plums made into chutney. Attached, to the side of the lean-to, was the greenhouse, which displayed a line of dried out tomato plants and my grandfather's rocking chair. Cobwebs abounded in every corner displaying numerous skeletons of flies. I do not think the potted tomato plants were meant to be particularly productive…the greenhouse was my grandfather’s funk hole – to get away from the family – it was either this or ‘the club’. The water butt stood outside the greenhouse and quite often, this water was used to rinse hair after washing because it was so soft.

The kitchen 'out back’ was accessed from the parlour with its own backdoor, [with tiny single pane window], leading to the garden and the brook. Hung on a hook is a dull green length of seaweed - to tell the weather. Of no more than eight feet by seven, with a sloping roof and brick floor, the kitchen catered for many; at its back room provided for the clothes washing copper boiler raised up on a brick plinth.The cooking was done on individual paraffin burners - any baking or roasting then the parlour range was used. The butler sink had a wooden draining board and the waste ran to a cesspit. The rest of the room was taken up by hanging pots and pans arraigned around the walls. It was all rather primitive but the cooked results, although simple fare - eaten with relish.

The Sunday joint would yield a bowl of dripping to use on toast or bread, instead of butter, chunks were put round the next joint to be cooked, or used for pastry or dumplings. Dripping was never wasted. As there were no refrigerators, food had to cooked almost at once and in hot weather the milk boiled. There was no farm collection of milk in the twenties and no pasteurising so it was literally from cow to customer transported in a churn from the dairy and ladled out… bottled milk was available, but by ladle was cheaper. 

Boxes of Sunlight soap kept on a shelf together with bluebags and starch; black-lead with brushes for the range and a whitening stone for the front door step. From this shelf hung the cooking utensils - the blackened frying pans and battered saucepans… there, too, hung the battered, steep sided pan that held simmering milk, the skimmed surface curds, removed - to make the clotted cream.
All the preserves were homemade using the fruit and vegetables from the garden. The meat from the butcher; the milk delivered straight from the dairy, as was the butter and the cheese. During the war granny, mixed margarine and butter together with wooden butter knives… shaping the patted result into a roll. This was to save money and eek out the ration coupons.

In one corner of the outhouse was a round boiler, on which, large wash pans or coppers were heated once a week to do the washing; extra soiled washing soaked overnight, and scrubbed, before putting into the boiler… to be pummelled with the dolly. After boiling the clothes taken out of the pan with a wooden spoon and put into a bucket of rinsing water… After the first rinse the clothes wrung out and rinsed again, and perhaps, even for a third time with a cube or little cotton bag of Ricketts blue dye dissolved in it - to whiten the washing. Back into the mangle for a final pressing then hung to dry. The washing line, stretched from the house corner to the nearest corner of the privy. It was a belief that a bluebag held against a wasp or bee sting would take any pain. The coloured articles went through the same process using a cooler water temperature.  The mangle with its large wooden rollers was kept next to the greenhouse door. When the clothes were dry, they were collected from the washing line sorted and ironed on a stout linen cloth, laid on the living room table. There was a selection of flat irons for different purposes, in the main though; it was a favourite pair that was placed on the hinged plate over the fire. These were used alternately. Gophering irons for rounded pleats went out of use in the twenties although still used to curl hair. The irons were left on the hearth to cool before being put back into the scullery.  

For my grandad’s stiffly starched collars - used for best, the ironed result kept in a special round box kept on the top of his wardrobe. These collars were attached to the shirt by a small stud. There were no shirts with collars attached before the 1930s. Thereafter, the ‘soft-collar’ became available for casual wear but still needing a collar stud front and back. It was during the Second World War that attached collars came into being - normal dress for men, shortly afterwards, a permanent fashion.   

For washing-up the crockery, an enamel bowl was used in the butler sink… soda, sprinkled into the water, helped dissipate any grease, there being no washing powder or liquid soap… perhaps a block of soap was pared down to help the process. All housework was done in strict routine. One of the weekly events was to sharpen and clean the knives. The knife blades were made of polished steel, not stainless, and had to be cleaned with emery cloth… if this was neglected the blades would rust. The range then treated with black-lead and the fender and fire irons cleaned - with wire wool. Brass doorknobs, fingerplates and lamp bowls cleaned weekly, so too the windows and pictures. Paraffin lamps filled daily - using a funnel, wicks trimmed, and the glass chimneys’ washed. Although workers homes were poorly decorated and furnished, great pride was attached to cleanliness and neatness, no home was smarter than my grandmother’s!  

The imposing panelled front door was painted leaf-green, which set-off the brightly shone brass knob. Opening inwards - to the right, the door lay open, propped open with a large cast iron dog… Linger awhile… take a last glance at the flower beds on either side of the front door and there, beyond the large stone door step, neatly laid as a border, a small box-hedge. In the beds are sweet williams and marigolds, in February, snowdrops and crocus. Now… smell the air, it is filled with the unforgettable smell of box… the sweet william just distinguishable…, in the distance the ticking clock invites you in.

Before you do so, you observe… a small hallway, off which - on either side, further doors. The one on the right leads to the parlour, behind the open front door, and to the left the living room. Straight ahead, leading upwards ranged the stairs, narrow and devoid of covering. They are scrubbed white, with stained brown edges. Stepping inside a couple of paces, you mount the stairs, clasping tight to the banister… taking good care not to make too much noise on the uncarpeted boards. At the top, a small landing gives you access to three bedrooms… all with sash windows looking out onto the front garden. All the bedrooms have brass bedsteads and knitted bed covers - in colourful squares. The mattresses were similar to the palliases I used when camping with the Boys Brigade – but stuffed with feathers not straw, which, as always, dipped in the middle… Over all, an eiderdown, made the coldest nights snug and warm. Each room had a washstand - bearing a large china bowl, jug and soap-dish - ranged on the top shelf.  At either side, hang two pink towels on rails. On a lower shelf, two chamber pots – handles, pointed to the side, this completes the arrangement… The chamber pots, plus the water from the bowl, were emptied into a slop pail, hiding its contents beneath a wooden lid. This was done every morning by my grandmother - who cast their contents into the drain outside the back door. A small rug, with indiscriminate floral pattern, lay at the side of each bed. The wood floors - stained and polished, in keeping with popular fashion, were complimented by the small rose-printed wallpaper and painted skirting. The rooms were simplicity itself, in keeping with the rest of the house and inhabitants. 

When the evening games were over there was a general movement around the table, as things were cleared away. The next day’s breakfast was prepared and the fire set-up - to draw gently during the night. Both my uncles and grandfather arrived home from the Poppe Inn, and were enjoying their last smoke outside... you could hear them outside discussing who won the last game.

The following day our family would be off to see Mother’s Sister Dora who lived in Bridport with husband and daughter Sheila. At Easter, time wild daffodils grew in profusion along the overgrown lanes. Later the bluebells adorned the glades in the woods - carpeted with their sky blue colour. My mother’s passion for wild flowers which gave just as much delight as the flowers at home; she told us tales of her childhood picking the kingcups, cowslips, foxgloves and all the other delicate flowers so tiny buried within the tuffs of grass. The cliff top walks to the top of Thorncombe Beacon to see Lyme Bay revealed below. The Pilgrims Way and the ancient village of Stanton St Gabriel, remains just showing behind the headland. The cliff top grass was soft, springy, and full of downland flowers. The lark would soar up singing in the sky watching where you went. Dorset was so full of surprising churches and ancient sites, delightful villages where the broad accent rang out true - unashamedly deep and melodic. The stroll along the pebble-strewn beach all the time looking for traces of prehistoric monsters and footsteps of Neolithic man. At the end of the day a lovely tea on spotless white cloth and the best chine and then home back to grandma's… another magical part of our holiday.

We boys, cajoled to drink our hot milk faster, tried to see the faces in the fire, as we watched the last soldiers - the burning soot, gradually retreat up the fire back. Meanwhile, the candles, in their brass holders, were being lit and the stone hot water bottles filled – to be buttoned up in their felt jackets… All the rooms other than the parlour were lit with tallow candles. The butcher made up the tallow from strips of fat. Then, up the creaking stairs… guided by the candle’s flickering flame – caused by the guttering wax - we cast our own ghostly shadows on the walls. As a door slammed outside the wind whistled round the eaves… it was strange how suddenly the candle flame would almost go out as a hidden puff of wind blew! It needed no urging us to get into bed, as fast as we possibly could… to hide under the bedclothes. The overly soft mattress sagged in the middle rolled us into the middle, we turned away… the candle snuffed… the hurried prayer, joined by my mother:

''There are four corners to my bed,
There are four angels at its head,
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,
Bless the bed that I lay on.''

Mum’s footsteps faded away as she went downstairs - causing the stair treads to creak once more..., the footsteps gradually died away… the beds springs stilled, all was quiet…

Waking the next morning was heralded by cooing dove and crowing cockerel, my eyes focused on faded, flowered wallpaper, fluttering lace curtains..., and my ears detected the noise of grandma riddling the parlour fire. The poker dropped against the brass fender… it was time for getting up. It did not take us boys long to get down stairs… the stream beckoned attendance… we were never in mind to disappoint it… as we struggled into our still damp shoes... another day dawned!

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Chapter IV: Cottage contents and farming pursuits====

All country cottages had a constant fight against damp. Rosalie Cottage had no cellar nor a damp-proof course -the ground floor was on a level with the outside garden. Other than the lean-to, kitchen, and scullery, whose floors were of sandstone brick laid on compacted soil, the rest of the ground floor rooms had flagstones. These were quite uneven and in some places loose. These were scrubbed and remained damp even on the warmest of days. There were no floor coverings except before the fire and at the side of the beds. Because the banks of the stream was slightly higher than the floor level of the cottage, although several feet away, there was a permanent rising damp problem. Two cast-iron down pipes lead from the gutters to soakaways leading back from the house.

The parlour: leading off the tiny hall, was to the right of the front door. An eleven-foot square room furnished in an Edwardian style with lace and chintz. The curtains: masking the edges of the sash windows were partially pulled back leaving the room dark and intriguing. The carpet, somehow, never imprinted its colour nor design on my mind… hidden under many pieces of furniture of highly polished dark wood, which included a whatnot and other small tables draped with lace held in place by a highly glazed pot, holding a fern, and dried flowers. The walls hung with faded engraved prints of cattle and highland scenes framed in dark wood; a mirror framed in ornate gilt hung over the mantle piece. I do not remember the room ever being used…

The living room… onetime the kitchen and scullery, was to the left of the font door and hallway. It was a large imposing room running from the front of the house to the back. It held an enormously heavy oaken table - which could be extended, perched on thick turned legs planted firmly on the stone slab floor. Over the table was spread a green-baize, fringed, tablecloth, which almost touched the floor. Single chairs, with their turned back posts and stretchers, darkened by frequent applications of beeswax and polished by much use, were tucked under the table. Behind four chairs, a line of coat hooks screwed into the sidewall. From these hooks hung all the family’s jackets, coats and scarf’s, all hidden by a heavy green curtain, which hung, from a pole close to the ceiling, to the floor. There must have been a love for green by my grandmother, much of the soft furnishing were that colour. The large oil lamp, hung over the table, had its wick trimmed, bowl filled, and glass chimney cleaned every morning. It’s warm gentle light emitted a flickering glow in the evenings… whose beams, hardly touched the furthers extremes of the room; the spluttering wick drew a circle of soot on the ceiling  and perfumed the whole house with it’s familiar burnt oil smell. There was a small deep-set window in the front wall behind granddads chair, its curtains drawn back at the bottom. The ledge was always filled to overflowing with books and papers, which prevented the window ever opening… its intended task not given a chance, even on the brightest and warmist of days!

The low ceiling and exposed beams were covered in various artefacts from: an ancient sword, drying mint, horseshoes, mousetrap hanging from a hook, and resting on a wooden shelf the stub of a candle.
Dominating the room, the great fireplace takes up the whole of the centre of the sidewall. The brick chimneybreast - forming the bulk of the cottage structure, supports the floor and joists. The range, probably a Bodley of Exeter of more recent times, is built into the back of the fireplace - its iron flue and canopy leads up into the chimney. Bread had been made in it and meat baked, both giving the room a homely smell… Above all, a large, champhered, and smoke darkened beam, supports the breast - from which a short curtain hangs… to prevent smoke billowing out into the room.
Above this ancient beam is a bracketed mantle-shelf, which carries an ancient French clock… It ticks away the hours… Behind the clock, a walnut framed mirror hangs reflecting the green curtained opposite wall. The remainder of the shelf houses the household’s spare-change box, a couple of porcelain ornaments, granddads pipe and tobacco, fire lighting spills and a used candle in a brass holder. There on the shelf, prominent even to the casual observer, a special box marked, ‘For the burial club’, received its sixpence a week with a ritual nod of grandads head - in recognition that he had made another week... to continue the fund…!

Emitting a plume of steam… a large blackened kettle sits on a hinged, fretted iron-plate - over the fire…, hissing gently. The kettle was there all the year round, day and night… filled always to the top ready for immediate use -  for making tea or washing. Our meals were all cooked in a large iron pot suspended from a bar set into the chimney. Meat of all persuasions, puddings, and vegetables all put in together, the potatoes held within a string cloth prevented from mixing with the pudding. On special occasions, we had roasted meat. Grandma twisted a skein of wool to make what she called a twisting jack fixed to the mantle shelf. It was our job to see that it did not stop spinning. Occasionally grandma retwisted the jack to set it in motion again. Bacon the most common meat. The eggs came from the chickens at the bottom of the garden and milk from the farm at the crossroads. Logs, stacked on top of the side-ovens and either side of the hearth - dry off… a sweet pungent smell pervades the room…; a brass-studded bellows, hangs from a nail, and there, on the opposite side, the warming pan - its polish brass reflects the flickering fire. The objects have been there for years… lovingly polished and dusted… now having a right to their place. Numerous nails, some of enormous size, protrude from the fire surround… the family long since forgotten why they were put there. To the left side of the fireplace a shelf carries the ancient wireless worked from an accumulator, above, a bookshelf filled with novels of long past authors…
 
To the left of the fire, in front of the window, was a large rocking chair clothed in chequered knitted blanket and cushions of deep red…my grandfathers. To the right, ‘a smoker’s chair’ – an oak wooden carver with curved horizontal arms, turned vertical rails and curved back. Colourful knitting and needles tucked down beside the arm; the whole, softened by a crocheted multi-coloured seat cushion… declared reservation - for my grandmother.  The back wall was almost totally taken up by a welsh-dresser, behind which the shove halfpenny board was kept. Plates lodged upon the shelves and cups hung from brass hooks. Its solid construction and much used appearance gave it a status undeserved by its value… upon its broad shelf resided the salt and knife box.

A hearthrug, framed one side behind the fender, and much pitted with scorch marks, set the two chairs apart. No one, other than granddad or grandmother, ever sat on those chairs! It was quite impossible to read at night… the paraffin lamp, suspended from the ceiling, cast its wavering chequered light across the ceiling… its halo of light cast upon the table, leaving the outer extremities of the room in darkness.  All those present, except my grandfather - who sat staring into the fire smoking his pipe, played whist, dominoes or shove-halfpenny? Whatever the season the room was always dark and smelt of burnt wood and lamp oil… and depending on the time of day, smoke from grandfather’s pipe. His habits were as ordered as the clicking clock. Every movement, action and breath tried before and found fitting. Nothing disturbed the ritual through the day. The clump of his boots on the stairs - both morning and night, gave voice to the time of day. I only ever saw him with a collar and that was in my parents wedding photograph. He was undoubtedly the king of all he surveyed – outside the home, his rule was law, inside however, my grandmother ruled the roost. It was a standard held firm in most country homes… The living room had a comfortable feel - secure and warm, with the ever-lighted fire flickering in the hearth. The front door and the two ground floor inner doors panelled to the same design, six-foot high, three feet wide and at least two and a half inches thick, sporting large brass doorknobs. Like the house and the people within built to last.

In the morning, those awake hear the doves cooing to each other from the school roof… as the thin pale sun lights up the garden. The scent of lavender, box and honeysuckle begin to percolate the air whilst a spiral of smoke starts to trickle up into the sky. A blackbird sings and the cock crows… grandma rakes the fire and clatters the pots. All this heralds another day just like all the others… Prior to smokeless fuel, all chimneys had to be swept annually to prevent chimney fires. This was even more important if the house was thatched. Most villages had their own chimney sweep that included selling manure in slack periods. It was normal for the sweep to inquire if the soot were to be taken away or left - to spread on the garden to prevent slugs. As the annual visit coincided with the cottage spring clean - the most popular period, he was always fully booked up. All the ladies of the village saw to it that they had their slot well booked up ready for the annual spring-clean a time had been set by grandma for the last day in March – a Monday. The previous evening the fire was allowed to die out and the hearth cleaned, removing all the usual paraphernalia that littered the range and fireplace. My mother recited how she hated the sweep coming for it meant a lot of work cleaning and putting everything back in its proper place.

The sweep appeared early the next morning his cart announcing his prescience as it was trundled to a noisy clattered outside the gate. All the furniture had dustsheets draped over them and the most important sheet of all was arranged by the sweep before the fireplace. The round bristle broom was inserted and the process begun – as the sweep jerked the broom up and down gradually lengthening the handle as the upper reaches of the chimney was penetrated… At last, with a jerk, the passage of the brush became easy and the sweep rushed outside to check that the brush had reached the top and was sticking out of the chimney. It was then, as the brush lowered, that the main work was done. Gradually the brush lowered until with a thump, the range was covered with soot and the brush appeared. Now the remains of his labour were collected up in several bucket loads. The price for the job had included whether or not grandad was to receive the soot for the garden. Each bucket load was taken outside and several piles appeared on the vegetable plot to be scattered and dug in or retained to deter slugs. With a nod from grandma, the cleaning job done to her usual high standard and the sweep disappeared for another year. Now, the annual spring-cleaning could begin…
    
Rosalie Cottage, in company with all the other village houses, held its annual spring-clean. No family admitted that this celebration of the end of winter was not carried out. The rugs and carpets taken outside to be slung over the washing line to be beaten. Net and lace curtains washed and hung out… windows cleaned and woodwork painted. Floors polished and walls distempered. All the sweeping by broom and dustpan… the flagstone floors scrubbed on hands and knees. The feather beds hung out of the windows to air. All the work in the house was done in the mornings leaving the afternoons for preparing the evening meal, bottling, pickling, jam making, sewing, knitting, and socialising with neighbours and friends.

The Collins’ cottage stood next to the old ford, now bridged over. On a summer’s day, the parapet afforded a convenient leaning place for members of the community to gossip over – discussing questions of the day and those things that concern the village. It is quite narrow, only allowing the easy access of hay cart, and driven flock or herd. It was originally built to save wet feet in times of flood and allow the passage of packhorse and drovers cart… It is like many others - picturesque, with a single arch; the swift flowing water  opens out downstream - where the depth lessens, allowing the rounded pebbles to make the water chuckle and gurgle on its way to the reed bed lower down.  

The garden gate opened onto the lane linking The Crossway’s corner - past school and shop… over the B37767, to Crewkerne, and on to Chard Junction – the nearest railway station. The name ‘street’ has a Roman origin, for paved way, this one linked all the main features of the village making it a frequent meeting place for passers by. In the twenties… on to the thirties, cars were a rarity – if a car went by children rushed to see it disappear up the road. Other than these rare moments, there was no traffic noise. Villages similar to Tatworth were self-sufficient; there was no necessity to travel afar. Many workers had bicycles and the carrier ran his delivery. There were very few changes to the village structure… for the same families existed - from generations past; everyone knew everyone else… there was no need to write the full address on an envelope for the persons name and village was sufficient. The exodus from the village final began after the war, in the 1950s, when young folk leaving school looked beyond the village. The change was remarkable for not only its completeness but also its speed. Still, I must not hurry the time along, the change was fast enough. Back, we must return, into the thirties and forties, as the robin’s bright eyes peered over the nest – his head swivelled, registering neighbouring birds calling to each other… the chattering swallows, heard in the eaves.

Occasionally a clatter of hooves announced a herd of cattle or sheep being driven by, off to Chard market… The accurate passage of time was not recognised, for very few people had wristwatches and only the older men wore a fob watch. On Sundays, the church bells rang for each service. The churchgoers filed past the gate. When the single bell stopped ringing the late comers ran…  Past summer memories return… the chirping of the crickets, the buzz of the bees… and the cock’s crows, to the cackle of laying hens. 

In outlying districts, oxen would provide the main pulling power, horses in areas with lighter soil. Women and men would follow along to break up the clods. The only relaxation from the grind of every-day work is a trip to market for the family. The wives and daughters would be in their best dresses their husbands in cord, cap and tweed. The rat and rabbit catcher was still an occupation each dead animal paid by the tail. Hunting was a fashionable sport. Sheep grazed on light arable land like the Dorset Downs. The shepherd and his dog could still be seen standing guard over the flock. Repairing his pens, erecting hurdles, setting up his troughs and hayracks whilst living in his movable corrugated hut on wheels where he sleeps in a bunk warmed by a small cooking stove during lambing time Hand shearing, sometimes done by  a single shearer and at other times a gang… began in early spring. 

Chard market, which opened each week, was one of the main cattle and sheep sales for the area and covered a large site with hundreds of pens. The auctioneer could be heard calling out the prices whilst the sheep gave voice and the cattle bellowed. This weekly market was what the rural community looked forward to each week. It gave the chance to sell their produce, hear the latest news and to keep up with prices. Streets would be sealed off, completely flocks, and herds driven in to be placed into their stalls and pens. The occasions were take for the wives to visit the shops and buy the produce that could not be purchased at the village shop. There were many customs and festivals all eagerly looked forward to and if possible attended. Mumming plays, May Days with a carnival procession - following the hobbyhorse, raising the Maypole, Morris-dancing, the harvest customs, bonfire nights and wakes… wassailing, on twelfth night and the local hunt ‘meet’.

Every year there were flower shows, fairs, fetes and feasts. Showmen’s vans and carts displaying garish and colourful posters; merry-go-rounds, stalls, roll a half-penny, coconut shies, gingerbread and lolly-pops. The showman’s drum would beat and calls made to gather in the customer; bells would ring and the one-man-band starts up. The jumble sale gave the villagers the chance to acquire cast offs and the unfitting given a new lease of life. Chipped plates a-plenty and broken children’s toys; all were queued for long before the opening hour. The stall, which held the greatest attention, was the children’s clothes. There was little ‘bye-your-leave’ but an undignified scramble… jumpers and blouses held up to the child to assess the correct size. The Rector circled the heaving mass never ceasing to be amazed by the aggressive tactics of the mothers. He was still due his tithes - one tenth of the annual produce from each parish. Even though this was reduced in 1836, many refused to pay it. There was much unrest and many court orders were issued. Even at the turn of the century through to the end of the First World War, and shortly after, tithes were paid. His control and standing soon began to fall-off never to assume its previous privileged position.

The farm-worker who looked after the horses was on many farms also the ploughman. He rose early to tend his horses that had to be fed two hours before they started work. During this time of cleaning, feeding and watering the ploughman had his own breakfast. When all was ready, the horses were led out to the field previously marked out for ploughing and an aiming stick planted to give a guide for the first ‘up’ furrow. The second ‘down’ furrow leaned against the first, making a ridge -a centre-furrow. The ploughman only worked for one continuous hour giving the horses a rest before starting again.Ploughing was an autumn job always a rush to see who could start first after the harvest over and the old ricks broken up to be spread – to be ploughed in, along with stable scrapings and contents of the dung heap.

Even during the Second World War, those working the land continued to follow old customs and attitudes. The ploughman, who worked alone, and his fine team of horses would plough and harrow the field ready for the seed to be sown by drilling. He lurched all day long with one leg down the furrow and the other up turning the fire blackened stubble of the previous year… watching the lifted turf roll off the mouldboard -  to compost down the top surface. During their breaks the horses would be given their nosebags contained oats and chaff. Huge flocks of seagulls that came straight from the sea at Seaton and Lyme Regis always followed the ploughing horses. Most of the fields had their attendant rusting farm implements stored away in odd corners - the sprouting corn, weeds and brambles slowly hid them from sight until they formed part of the hedgerow.

The productive arable land was not so intensively managed in the early thirties. Later on, when Britain tried to be more self sufficient, every spare piece of land was used to produce food. It was known that lime and sulphuric acid wash out of the soil and should be replaced. Lime was the chief dressing, which then began to be used extensively - in the autumn.

When my mother was born, and for some years after, it would not have been strange to see oxen ploughing. Oxen had been used for farm work long before the horse in all corners of the world. Their working ability, after training, was the same although the ox stronger – could deal with land that is more difficult but they were slower. Their keepers took as much time over their appearance, with the tips of their horns capped in brass and bells beneath their necks.  A farmer would use an ox because they existed on courser food and were fast eaters, withstood worse weather, and after a couple of years could be fattened and sold at market. They were a cheaper option – needed no shoeing; horses were mainly for personal riding and carriage work. When fat beef cattle were preferred for slaughter the life of the ox became less secure… the advent of the tractor finished their working life completely and that of the ox-carter.

After ploughing in the stubble, manure spread, and yard waste added, the field was left for the frost to work, ready for harrowing in spring. The cereal varieties have changed over the years to ripen quicker and have shorter stalks. Although this is good for the farmer it is not so for wildlife. The poor unfortunate field mouse no longer builds its nest at the top of a swaying corn stalk… Some of the field were left in fallow for the next year and others planted with pink clover, vetch, yellow mustard or broad bean. These were used as animal fodder - whilst the livestock fertilized the ground as they fed… Swedes were grown as an animal crop… either dug up or fed to the cattle… or the sheep turned into a fenced section of the field - to graze… the shepherd daily moving the hurdles, until the whole field covered.

Later on, the flock would be moved into shelters, still using the hurdles and bales of straw to enclose an area for the ewes to have their lambs. Coupling up a horse to the shafts of a horse-drawn hut-on-wheels, the shepherd would tow the hut to a convenient spot close to the flock and out of the wind. The hut was necessary, for him to stay with his dog, day and night, to guard the flock and to administer to the needs of the ewes shortly to give birth. The shepherd’s hut contained a bed, chair and small stove to provide some heat and cook his meals… he would stay there until lambing was over.The shepherd’s son was thirteen, coming on fourteen, entrusted with looking after a flock of sheep on the common. He drove the sheep taking a number of different routes - to crop new grass along the way. The path bypassed sown crops and populated hamlets keeping off roads and highways. Taking in the lie of the land, the larks soaring overhead, the growing wheat, and frisking rabbits. Along the path that lead to stream and brook giving water to the hurdle flock as it passed. This was a treat, a change from turnips. In the past, forty years previously – at the turn of the century, there had been a recovery from the imported corn and lamb. Once again, the farmer who had survived the bad years started to receive the benefits of patience and perseverance. Not those things got back to pre 1870 but they were certainly better than the nineties. In the good old days the farmers planned a succession of crops for the sheep mainly vetches, clover and turnips. With the hurdle fold moved daily the shepherd rationed what food was available.

Lambing occurred in February and within the hurdles were bales of hay placed to afford shelter and food. Although it was a bad month for the uncertain weather, it did take regard of the coming spring and the new shoots of grass. The coming summer markets were the goal of the shepherd… his every working moment now directed to achieving the best fattening for the new lambs. Farmers who had the space built lambing pens in the barn but we are more concerned about the shepherd who did not have this luxury. Often you could see, as you passed along the lane, a corner of a field sheltered by high hedges – the lea protected from the prevailing winds. Close to the corner a rick, placed there since time immemorial for the same reason… It was to be the forth side to a pen using the meeting of two corner hedges and a set of hurdles, the third… Perfect for the job. As the lambs were born more individual coops constructed from bales and hurdles inside the main pen. This was no spur of the moment devise but one handed down through the centuries.

The shepherd’s life was an exacting one for about six weeks. His hut-on-wheels emitted smoke from the bent chimney from his tiny round stove. The morning fry-ups always with ample early morning mushrooms smelt fantastic as the sausages spat and sizzled. He tramped his rounds every few hours with his trusty dog, who’s post the at the foot of the steps leading to the shepherds hut, remained his domain. The bed, with the colourful crotched cover remained unmade... no need to be worried about being chastised for not being tidy. The small table and rickety chair, the only furniture, softened by a dusty print hanging askew and from projecting wooden pegs an assortment of aprons, straps and topcoats. For this period, he was the key worker receiving due deference from passers by and other farm workers who acknowledge his importance. His boss kept him supplied with bacon, sausage and bread, and topped up his jar of ginger beer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==float and double performance==

In C++, &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; is often more efficient than &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;.
With my computer (Intel Core2 Quad CPU Q6600 @ 2.4 GHz), the following code runs in about 17 seconds (exploiting only one core), if compiled by Microsoft C++ compiler version 15 for 32-bit 80x86 using the &quot;/Ox&quot; option:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int main() {
	typedef float number;
	const number limit = 60000;
	number a = 0;
	for (number i = 0; i &lt; limit; ++i) {
		for (number j = 0; j &lt; limit; ++j) {
			if (i == j) a += i;
		}
	}
	return a &gt; 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Replacing &quot;float&quot; with &quot;double&quot;, it runs in 7 seconds.
How can you explain it?

: I compiled your microbenchmark with gcc 4.5.1 using -O2 and got the following results on Intel Core2 Duo T7250 @ 2.0 Ghz:
: float 7.759s +- 0.02s
: double 7.797s +- 0.02s
: I am certain that in your case Microsoft C++ compiler uses non-optimal path for float. It probably performs the calculations in the FPU and rounds internal 80-bit precision data to 32-bit precision after each operation. If compiler used SSE2/3 it'd have almost the same performance in both cases.
: Also, I must note that this microbenchmark is not a real world scenario as its bottleneck is raw computational speed (all variables will almost certainly be in the registers), while most real world applications have their bottlenecks in memory bandwidth. Using twice as large data type uses twice as much of memory bandwidth, introduces many more cache misses and is twice as slow even to compute if using vectorized code (e.g. employing SSE2/3/4 capabilities). For example try to multiply two 2000x2000 matrices. You'd definitely get huge slow downs if using double.[[User:1exec1|1exec1]] ([[User talk:1exec1|talk]]) 14:06, 1 September 2010 (UTC)


:Again. One x86 or ARM floating point SIMD instruction can operate on twice as much floats than doubles (see [http://software.intel.com/sites/products/documentation/hpc/composerxe/en-us/cpp/win/index.htm#intref_cls this], the compiler intrinsics section]. Also [http://www.agner.org/optimize/optimizing_assembly.pdf this], p.111-112, ''Vector programming'', quote: ''It is advantageous to choose the smallest data size that fits the purpose in order to pack as many data as possible into one vector register.''). Even then, the throughput of instructions operating on doubles is a bit slower (see [http://www.agner.org/optimize/instruction_tables.pdf | here], e.g. &lt;tt&gt;mulps&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;mulpd&lt;/tt&gt;). This is how we arrive at the fact that doubles are 2 to 3 times slower. I'm not even talking about increased register pressure and lower cache performance, both of which are non-linear, that is, we are already guaranteed to have 2 times lower performance, but there's potential for much higher penalties.[[User:1exec1|1exec1]] ([[User talk:1exec1|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/1exec1|contribs]]) 23:06, 20 August 2011 (UTC)

== Grouping several arrays into a single array of structures ==
I have to strongly disagree with this advice. Any compiler worth it's salt will see that the initial code can be vectorised trivially, where as the proposed &quot;optimisation&quot; would make it impossible for the compiler to perform such an important optimisation. The reverse optimisation, array of struts to a struct of arrays is a very common performance optimisation taught all over the place, simply because the compiler can apply vectorisation. I would strongly suggest that this section be rewritten to recommend the reverse transformation.

I checked the performance of both solutions and actually found that you are right. I remembered that the architectures of 20 years ago behaved differently, but now it no more as I remembered. Therefore I removed this advice, and added an opposite advice at the last section of the last chapter.--[[User:Carlo.milanesi|Carlo.milanesi]] ([[User talk:Carlo.milanesi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Carlo.milanesi|contribs]]) 20:48, 27 April 2012 (UTC)

== Use of const after class function declaration ==
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int i = 0; // Non-class variable, given so const does not apply to the beginning of the function
class a {
	char variable;
	int somefunc() const {
		// use const only if somefunc() does not modify any of class variables
		return ++i;
	}
};

Does const after a function improve the speed, or is it just there as a safeguard against coders' errors?
&lt;/source&gt;

== The int and unsigned int types are, by definition, the most efficient ones on any platform. ==

Sorry, but that is wrong for small devices. Integer is at least 16 bit. On an 8 Bit CPU (micro controller) an integer is still 16 Bit width and needs more clocks than an 8 Bit operation. For example take a Atmega (AVR). It has a 8 Bit wide data width and has only the operations ADD (Adds two 8 Bit registers, 1 cycle), ADC (Adds two 8 bit registers and modifies the carry flag, 1 cycle) and ADIW (Adds an Immediate to 16 Bit, two cycles). So there is no one cycle operation for adding two 16 bit values. However this behaviour is true for most 8 bit processor.

: Don't forget to sign your comment.
: I agree that the book is overstating the case here. I'll have a quick go at qualifying the sentence, but I'm happy for someone else to refine it further. --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fishpi|contribs]]) 07:47, 5 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here is a good starting vocabulary list to learn.

This is the wordlist given at the start of Vere aŭ Fantazie, by Claude Piron. It is the 400 or so words that a beginner should know after completing a beginner’s textbook or course, such as Gerda Malaperis. Piron assumes that you will already know all these words before starting to read Vere aŭ Fantazie, his collection of tales for progressing beginners.

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Chapter V: Over the garden gate====
Within the time allotted for lambing, the first green tender points of new grass began to show. It was getting on for late April when it was time to move the ewes and their youngsters down to the meadows. Still the ground was penned to allow the new grass to have a chance to grow. Within two or three weeks, the whole field could be opened up. By May, there was an abundance of clover, vetches, pea, old dredge corn, and wild rye, to feast upon. Haymaking time was fast approaching…

The ploughman would quickly follow on after lambing, if not done previously, or with the harrow - to break-up furrows - to prepare the surface ready for sowing. Whereas the harrow only cuts up the top, the plough digs and moves the soil in a certain direction. The ploughman considers how to turn over the soil – to prepare it for the winter’s action, composting the previous year’s stubble and root systems whilst allowing air to circulate; all the time giving thought to proper surface drainage making sure ditches were kept clear - without causing erosion or a series of hollows. It was normal working practice to plough furrows along he contours of the land. There were only a few reversible mouldboards and these were not always successful… so ploughing ‘up’ and ‘down’ was done a certain distance apart – into ‘gathers’. These strip of ploughing kept the field in its original state consciously allowing the ploughshear to skate upon the surface, at the turn of each row. Finally, the whole field was circled anti or clockwise to set the direction of the soil needed. Ploughing was performed soon after the stooks had been removed to the rick, and the wastage burnt off.

It was almost a race to see which farm started work first… making sure all was ready for the first frosts to break the turf. Old ricks were broken down, and together with chaff, spread over the field to be ploughed in. The ploughed fields in autumn allow the winter’s weather to break down the clods, which together with the rains exposed the flints and stones… These were picked up and removed to the edge of the field by children - to swell the heaps of many generations of labour. Steam powered engines worked the land operated by contractors using sets of cultivating equipment … these became less used at the start of WWII. However, threshing and barn work still carried on with steam power as did road repairs using steamrollers.

At the beginning of the thirties, just after the General Strike ended, the agricultural community was in tatters. Generations of farm workers suddenly found themselves out of work – all their hard won skills unwanted. Many found work in factories, like the butter factory or lace mill. Some turned their hand to building, being somewhat allied to farm maintenance work. This increase in building work was to be seen and felt all over England, particularly along the railways lines, and towns. It was fortunate that the lace factory continued to produce net for curtaining. However, none of this happened without a great deal of anxiety and worry.

Boys left school aware of local customs and work habits. Within a short space of time, they absorbed a number of different skills - all to do with building and farm work. These skills they picked up watching their elders and listening to their conversation. The tractor driver knew a thing or two about machinery and its maintenance. The ploughman could repair a fence, weave a hurdle and dig a ditch and the dairyman could become a shepherd - if needs be! No different for their wives and girl friends - it was a matter of being versatile, for jobs were rare and times were hard. Not one of them does the same job… day in and day out… throughout the year. They may like to, but circumstance dictate they have to turn their hand to anything that needs doing.

At the start of the Second World War when the government were forced to make the country ‘as self sufficient as possible’ farming began a series of transformations. As much land as possible was quickly brought into cultivation - some neither economic nor practical. More tractors and harvesters brought into use to cope with difficult terrain, larger fields: lack of skilled ploughmen, insufficient casual and migrant labour, and conscription of The Women’s Land Army.
The country was at total war it was no good having too many scruples about maintaining parks and gardens or maintaining small fields and non-negotiable gateways. From the time when I was old, enough to take notice until well into the 1950s when rationing still in force, self-sufficiency was the governments aim. The farmer was as much fighting the war as the soldier; if not cooperative, he was forced to comply with The Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery’s strictures or removed from his land. It was a difficult time; the seasons dictated the speed of progress towards the government’s diktats… it was not many years before, that flails were used to thrash out the corn. 

In the winter of 1939 there was enormous activity on the land… two million extra acres were to be sown in preparation for war. There was not enough equipment including horses – only fifty-five thousand tractors were available, in all of Britain. Winter starts in mid November when the last leaves blown off the trees - by the harsh cold wind. It does not take long for the Technicolor picture of summer to fade and the cold hard reality of winter about to descend… The icy blasts harden the furrow’s ridge turned up by the plough’s mould-board as the field is prepared for the winter sowing of wheat. Over the hedge the field of Swedes were dug up for market, and the remainder placed in clamps, next to the potatoes and mangold-wurzels. The carrots and beetroots taken inside the barn and put into tubs of dried peat.

Soon the onetime rain-filled clods are frozen rock hard. The dry twigs - lifeless rumpled leaves, and remnants of half-eaten acorn, and chestnut, crackle underfoot. Everything covered in the rime of hoarfrost… the countryside, glistens in the sparkling winter sunlight. On the allotment garden it is the month of digging and planting, making sure the beds are ready for next years potatoes, broad beans, cabbages, and onions.  The occasional flurry of snow showers are chased hither and thither by the north wind. The last of the leaves drop at the beginning of December… the bare trees show their deformities to the windward side as the chilling wind dries up the last remaining moisture. Wheat sowing continues unabated as the last field are ploughed for oats. Whilst the hedgehog, dormice and bat hibernate, other animals lie still - conserving energy… Not all animals are retiring though… for the fox and weasel are on the prowl.

It is time for grandad to prune the fruit trees and take cuttings from the currants. There is little time for the birds to feed…  grandma puts out an enamel plate, on the grass, full of table scraps… it is not long before the plate is bare! The gorse on the common and the winter-toadstool in the wood, give the only colour to an otherwise grey scene. Pairs of hooting tawny owls begin their courtship feeding… not giving the foraging mouse and scurrying vole time to linger!
The wind begins to be noticeably colder – it is now bitterly cold with clear skies. Walking about close to the stream, the dead leaves were now frosted and sparkled in the morning light. The mistletoe in the lime trees looked like airy nests against the sky. The ditches are checked to ensure they are free and not blocked and the manure is taken to the remaining field that have so far escaped ploughing. Any good day is taken up spreading lime on fields for the brassicas.  

The edges of the stream freezes… it is only the swift flow of the water in the centre that keeps it free from ice. The snowstorm fulfils the promise of the dark, heavy clouds… the lanes and fields merge: it is truly, a bleak mid winter scene. The wind swirls the snow about creating banks against the hedges. It is just as well that the workers in the butter factory can walk to work - for trying to cycle is impossible! Some dried reeds disguised the fact that the young growth had started to show through the frost-covered ground, as a lonely bulrush nods its bedraggled head at the strength of the wind. It starts to rain and the light fades fast… The sheep begin to move towards the sheltered side of the field… A patch of dead flag iris cropped down by the sheep displays new growth - just visible under trampled leaves. A flock of lapwings fly overhead as a startled partridge races away.

Grandad spends his time in the greenhouse studying the seed catalogues the trays bearing the seed potatoes are under the shelf starting to sprout. Back in the cottage, the fire in the parlour range heats the room and casts a cheery glow. Outside hardly a sound disturbs the snow-bound village… The family gather round the fire comforted by the crackling, hissing sap, as it bubbles out of the burning wood; the occasional crack heralds another flying ember... the nearest target extinguishes the glowing missile whilst grandma serves out the next round of cooked chestnuts… passing them in turn round the ring of fire lit faces. They do not linger… the offered nut is far too hot – is tossed from hand to hand…
 
The snow gives way to slush and the banks of the stream overflow. The bridged, one time ford, holds back the flow… the water creates a pool that dissipates towards the reed bed. A weak sun and drying wind soon returns the fields to a furrowed brown. At last, time to break up the spade turned soil - in preparation for outside sowing. February is the month to sow parsnips – the first vegetable to begin the cycle all over again. It will not be long before the purple orchid graces the woodland glade, to be followed by the pansy and violet.

There was talk about a mole that had been busy in the garden making a series of mounds across the grass under the apple trees… it is just as well that the mole is not distracted in its digging by the sodden ground. The snowdrops are a pitiable sight, dipping and bending under the weight of water. The rain continues to fall… Will it ever be possible to be warm again, and to run barefooted over the grass?

As soon as the scattered primroses line the ditches, the bees begin to fly. Now, at last, spring is in the air - to last from March to the end of April. Throughout England in the thirties, and at other times - after tillage, farmers would sow their seed to coincide with their area’s weather and ground temperature - knowing that spring is a period of instability. It is time now to attend to fattening and breeding stock.

Therefore, it would be wrong to say that on the first day of spring the corn was cast… wheat was sown in February, oats in March and barley in April. What decided the issue would be how the suns rays had warmed the ground - the local meteorological forecast for future sun, and the access of machinery… not on the amount of rain or wind. The sown seed is then promoted into life by dampness and decaying plant acting as an insulator from the cold night air. Usually after the warmth of the March sun just as the blackthorn comes into bloom - plant growth is triggered - when the ground temperature is 43ºF. The early potatoes are planted and the summer carrots pricked out… early dwarf peas and summer spinach sown in succession. The onion sets are given their regimental rows, together with the shallots. There is so much to do that it is late before granddad settles down in front of the fire.

The buds on the oak tree noticeably green peeps out. At last, winter is over… Along Perry Street, the ivy leaves on the walls are bright and shiny and opposite the church, the Jubilee Tree outlined against the pale blue sky. There is talk about some snow; forecast for the afternoon… the news does not interest the cock blackbirds who watch their hens battle it out on the grass. The wind now is blowing quite hard a few drops of rain fall - shaken out of the trees… 
The rooks are repairing their nests. It is a time of great activity in the field, hedge and tree. The invaders migrating from abroad challenge competition between breeding birds for what food is available. The dawn chorus proclaims each individual’s territory, beginning well before sunrise. Now the swallows begin to arrive… just before the cuckoo’s call.

Down by he stream the willow’s twigs and branches show more colour and buds have started to form on the ash. At last, spring is beginning to show itself… the hawthorn buds are green and the pussy willow worth collecting. Those blackbirds have started rowing again as they chase each other, making such a racket. The work on the farm increases in intensity, the machinery shaken out and oiled. Before sowing can take place the farrows had to be levelled off and the clods reduced. Harrowing with drag harrows with iron teeth reduced the soil to a fine tilth. Rolling could be used alternately to further reduce the lumps of soil. It was always beneficial to cover sowed seed to prevent birds for destroying the field. Sowing was still partly done by hand but quickly died out in the early thirties except awkward corners and small fields. A good sower of seed could cover an acre field using just three pounds of seed.

Mechanical drilling was often done with two horses and would take an hour to cover an acre field. A trickle of grain fell down the funnel into the small furrow from the box. The roller followed the seed-drill, in many places drawn by horses.
Mangelworzels, spread over the next field by hand, or from the back of a horse drawn cart, this gave the sheep something to crunch on, particularly at lambing times; this fertilized the field, although the mangols were difficult to pull out of the frozen ground.

It was the schoolchildren’s job to scare away the rooks using battered pans and rattles. The high branches of the elms hold the rookery - the nests made out of twigs laced together hold firm against the swaying of their homes. They are there surviving the winter storms to be rethatched the following spring. The rook’s cries… filled the air. In the houses and cottages, the start of spring heralded Spring-cleaning. All the rag, wool hand-stitched loose rugs would be taken out of the house to be beaten. As the cottage door was left open on most days – not only to air the living room but allow the smoke filled atmosphere to clear, the rugs would be damp… having to be hung on the washing line to dry before house-work started.

In the garden, it is the month of almost continual weeding, transplanting and thinning out. The greenhouse is taken up with pots of this and that sprouting up… The sweet peas are taken out to be planted and summer cabbage given another row. We start having rhubarb tart for starters… 

The stream seems to know winter is over - that new life forming… It bubbles and chatters over the rounded stones on the streambed in celebration, sparkling brightly - in the morning sun. The catkins hang down from the hazel as a new growth of bramble entwines round the stem. At the base a patch of assorted primroses, some white, others pink, vie with the violets to brighten up the riverbank, mainly colourless in its winter coat… I wonder who is going to hear the first cuckoo… The cows from the farm start to enter the field… over the hedge there is a great deal of lowing. The milking is still done by hand in many areas - especially small farms, 100 million gallons a year was transported to London by rail in the thirties using special milk vans. Field crops were planted by hand every potato sown by gangs of local women and children all paid just four shillings a day, the same rate for stone gathering. However much the land around is finding new life the farming people still are challenged by the daily grind.

The swallow whirl overhead… they swoop round the eaves darting here and there just for the fun of it. If only they would be still – just for a moment. The reeds, once flattened and bedraggled, standing upright, resplendent in green. The hoverfly staggers by as he hurries home carrying his sacks of pollen. Now it is the turn of the wagtails to dart amongst the now active undergrowth wagging their tails vigorously on landing. There is no doubting the advent of summer, as the May buds start to open… All along the bank, the riversides bestiritself. The flash of orange-red and turquoise startles them as the kingfisher, showing off, dashes by… 

Early May sees the birth of summer… the weather makes a perceptible improvement. The trees spread their canopies giving shade… filtering the sunlight onto the ground. Now the insects start to home in on their particular source of food. The open countryside starts to change colour as each fruit starts to ripen. The birds start to quieten when the lazy days of summer herald school holidays and another harvest, about to be planned.

The splendid horse-chestnut tree in the next field now has bright green leaves and a few sticky buds are opening… it will not be long before the flowers open… At last, summer is just around the corner…, it has taken so long. All the winter rains and chill winds seem an age away. The hawthorn blossom is such a delicate thing but the most prolific flowing tree - which starts the race - for all the other blooms to follow. In the field, the first buttercups give voice to early summer suns. The cuckoo call seems to echo, bouncing off the trees in the wood.

Down by the stream the early summer sun warms up the cow-parsley the myriad small white flowers give off a scent that is slightly sour - hangs in the air. Close to the riverbank, the cow’s foot weed. It appears as if a larger version of the watercress, or giant clover; whose flower has to wait two or three days before its ball is fully open. Is it any wonder that it is such a favourite of the bee… who unfortunately has to be content with nectar from the comfrey? It is just as well that the bee is such an active insect – life would soon come to a halt without its labour. Little do that pair of tufted ducks care about such esoteric thoughts, they are far too busy - concerned about their nest and the batch of speckled eggs it contains… In the deeper stretches of the river a pair of swans continue their patrol - first this way and then that. No river scene is complete without their graceful presence. Dusk begins - soon after tea; the evening stroll requires the welcoming comfort of a coat. A turn up the road, over the bridge… a glance over the hedge shows the mist is beginning to raise… the reed bed is now a distant outline.

A second sowing of French beans is tackled first thing after breakfast on Saturday, quickly followed by the potatoes being earthed-up. The kitchen garden is now almost fully planted with neat orderly rows stretching across all the gardens. Nothing is left to chance for it is most important that the garden produce all that the family needs.

Tinkers still visited the villages in the thirties… and on into the early war years, their carts rattling over the stones… the men about to set up their braziers to heat the pots and pans. They would grind and sharpen the gardening tools, household scissors and kitchen knives. Their call of, ‘scissors to grind’, an oft-heard cry, as they spun the grindstone wheel. The tramps too made their way along Perry Street with their loads of clothing tied in bundles. It was not unusual to find one setting up his pot over a fire or making his lean-to tent. They never seemed to be thin… perhaps it was the amount of clothing they wore that fattened then out? They were in the main successful beggars, housewives giving them a crust or drink of milk to make them go away. For hamlets and outlying villages – away from the main highways, where the population was sparse the Tinkers and Hawkers took the place of small shopkeepers – they were an essential part of the countryside – a much relied on source of communication as well as suppliers of essential goods. 

Pedlars and Knife-grinders also had a place in rural life… they plied their trade too. In those days the Pedlar was called the Chapman and was very welcomed… he passed on news and gossip to outlandish places in a similar way to the Tinker carrying an amazing variety of goods in his carpetbag – pins, needles, vests, caps, girdles, laces, gloves, knives, glasses, tapes, dusters and much else besides. He sold clothes for babies, cleaning materials for the kitchen and floor. Lengths of material, aprons, ribbons, and thread, for the dressmakers, and wool for the knitters. All were very handy for those unable to get out - to the shops in town. The Pedlars had their rounds and were expected to provide the same produce summer and winter… for they were relied on… His round was passed on - from father to son - jealously guarded. No tradesman’s cart invaded his preserves… for in some instances, he worked conspiring with a local town’s, general store - which provided his merchandise. It has been known for Tinkers to set up shop within the village, and in time to be accepted and integrated into the running of the village co-operative. There was no other means of obtaining these articles for who else would travel on rutted tracks in all weathers and in all seasons. 

The proud gypsies, with their dogs, still wandered the lanes of England, most staying within their locality where they knew the habits of the workers and the farming community. Some stayed in town during the winter only travelling during the summer months to sell what they had traditionally made; others worked picking the summer crops.  The women sold wooden pegs, woven baskets and bunch of ‘lucky’ heather whilst the men picked the fruit, helped with the harvest and planted the seed. In winter, they sold scrap metal and made-up their stock. The traditional highly coloured bow-topped van, with its decorated sides and neat, stepped, glazed door - displaying gaily painted cans and boxes, all pulled by a single horse. Often there a convoy of gypsy caravans which passed by heading for an old familiar campsite? Underneath the cart, a cage was to be seen carrying a clutch of hens. The rabbit catching lurcher loped along ready at a call to find a rabbit for the pot. The families would all meet up at the same site to pick fruit or vegetables in season… re-establishing past friendships - cementing family links.

The Spanish onion seller on his bike operated from coast to hinterland. Having his own route cycled year after year, with his strings draped over every part of the bike so that it looked like a travelling stack on wheels. It is the time of year when the sky shows a saturated blue above the new, fresh foliage of the nearby elms. The sky’s colour, so intense that it creates a lightening vignette - halo, around the skyline branches. This distortion or adjacency is purely an action of poor eyesight not actual. It is unlikely for a human being not to be uplifted by natures allure. At last all the trees are in full foliage although still not fully formed and the sunlight reaches the ground below allowing under plantings to flourish.

Early summer mornings in June are heralded by the cocks crowing in all the chicken runs - at the bottom of the garden. This would be the start to one’s day, quickly followed by the dawn chorus and the chatter of swallows in the eaves. There being no traffic as such only the clip-clop of the milkman’s horse and cart, resplendent in its coloured paint outlining its panels… the open back, made it look like a chariot, swayed as the milkman descended to deliver the days supply. The welcoming chink of his bottles and clank of his churns was another reminder…

Along the roadside dense thickets of blackthorn covered in early morning dew, sharp smelling and alive with bees feasting off the white blossom. In the fields, the chirping grasshoppers fidgeted and the ever-buzzing insects flew about with a purposeful beat to their wings. Along the lane the mighty stag beetle worked his way over the rotting wood, his, was only a very short life, whilst the ants formed up one behind each other carrying their scrap of leaf, to who know where? No phones rang, no planes flew overhead and no dust was disturbed on the lanes. There was always plenty of time and the tranquil scene remained unspoilt even through the war years. Down stream, from the bridge, there are two workmen cutting the weeds and dragging it to the side of the bank. Quantities of weed escape the attention of the men and drift down river becoming entangled in the trailing willow branches. It is late afternoon and the warm light highlight the heads of the marsh orchid amongst the waist height reeds. The swans paddle by now accompanied by their young, little grey-brown bundles of downy feathers. It is getting late and the background hum of insect life quietens the evening strollers, as they start up the road towards the Poppe Inn. 

 The end of each day was announced by the screech of owls in the neighbouring trees, the local cats fighting for territory, and the bark of foxes in the copse. Pathetic crying… another victim would follow the occasional fluttering, scuffles and rustles... The countryside was not always sleeping!

Most villages were self-supporting in that they had a shop, a butchers and bakers. The fields and gardens provided the rest. Many folk had a bicycle - adequate for getting to work or shop - there was always the carrier to cart the extra purchases. Village life carried on with the help of small businesses - passed on from generation to generation. Because families were large most of the children, on leaving school, left home to take up employment in the nearest town, which was in this case Chard. At least one boy always followed the father’s occupation and one of the girls looked after the aging grandparents. Later on, the same daughter looked after the parents. Other girls within the family provided help in wealthier homes, close to the family home. Those children left at home after the parents had died usually took over the tenancy. Although it was difficult to travel about there was a lot of visiting of families, friends and relations, which closely bonded the community. Most of the village and local industry served the farmers - their farms and country estates. There was, throughout the year, a general working up towards harvesting time – getting all the machinery into working order.

It was not often that my grandma went shopping to Chard. The lack of money being the chief reason but distance and time made it a chore not an enjoyment. The children going to school, then to work, had to be looked after. Still, there were times when a visit had to be made, and more often than not, for clothing. Only working class mothers inhabited the shops. Nobody who wished to be thought of as middle class would be seen in such places. The workers manners, clothes and speech would embarrass the shop girls of high-class establishments. The formidable shop-walker, in black jacket and striped trousers - who’s job it was to provide security and to stop shop-lifting, would soon hover close to unfamiliar faces as soon as they came through the door enquiring if he could direct you…?

The shop windows would be dressed very conservatively. The plaster models and designer sets represented daily scenes, most of the produce was kept in glass fronted drawers or cupboards – not in a position where the customer able to handle the goods. The shop assistant would be told the item to be assessed and they would have to fetch it and point out its suitability. If the article was large then the shop’s carrier called to either see the client to the door or to take the item out and place it in the dogcart or carriage. It was possible to take the item on approval. Then the carrier would take the clients name, address, and list the goods taken. No deposit was required and the client departed.

Tills or cash registers were not on the counters. The cashier sat in a glass sided cubicle at the back of the shop. The shop assistant took the cash to the cashier - who placed it and the price tag in a metal container that was taken by cord and air pressure along a tube to the office. The receipt and change returned by the same route. If the change included a farthing, this was used to buy pins or some other small item. The penny bazaar was a favourite place to visit, especially for children to spend their savings. Such places had an open front and display counters presenting all their produce to open view. They were always well attended the crowd shuffled through at a snails pace as… the excited children stared in wonderment. This was the forerunner of Woolworth’s ‘thrupenny and sixpenny’ store.
The shops stayed open late on Saturdays particularly those in the street or market place. It was the place to buy cheap meat for the weekend roast, at the end of the working day. On market days, the place was alive with people, with stallholders all shouting - declaring their wares. It was always colourful and exciting with the one-man-band playing, jugglers and the occasional beggar… all demanding attention.   

Grandma was careful, that whenever buying any material - it was carefully examined. The material was rubbed to see if the cloth was full of ‘dressing’ - which would wash out leaving the garment thin and limp. Clothes for her children were always bought too large, so that they could be worn for the longest possible time and then handed down. Invariably the colour was white, in that way they could be repeatedly washed - without wondering if the colour was going to last, and being the same colour as sheets, pillowcases and towels they could all be washed together. 
All bed linen was white, which allowed girls, about to be married, to sew on lace edging… similarly the towels, flannels and tray cloths – embroidered then laid in tissue paper in the lowest drawer. Each daughter reserved this drawer for her private things – for her ‘bottom drawer’, items kept aside for when she became married. On rainy days this drawer was carefully turned out – relined, and then refilled. Keeping a bottom drawer was started at a very young age and used to condition girls - to seek a husband and start their own home. It was also used to keep the girls occupied. If they left home to be ‘in-service’, they ‘lived in’ - treated as one of the family, under the control of the housekeeper. In that case, the bottom drawer stayed where it was; ready for the day she left home for good. Household items were bought to last a lifetime. Good saucepans and frying pans were very heavy - made of iron, and carefully treated with oil, which eventually became burnt-on and black. This was never washed or scoured off, but left – being just wiped out. For boiling vegetables, plain white enamel was thought to be suitable.

The '''adjustable grip hitch''' is a simple and useful [[:Category:Knots/Friction hitches|friction hitch]] which may easily be shifted up and down the rope while slack. It will hold fast when loaded, but slip when shock loaded until tension is relieved enough for it to again hold fast.

This knot is also called &quot;Adjustable Loop&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Knots &amp; Ropework, The Ultimate Encyclodpedia of; by Geoffrey Budworth, ISBN 1-84309-138-0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Can't start a new tab==
I can't start a new tab from the search bar. Feature or bug? Its complete horrible anyhow! ¨Anon
:This is a long-standing problem. Buttons (as a general rule?) don't provide links that can be used for a new browser tab. For example, page history has a button &quot;Compare selected revisions.&quot; Hovering the cursor over it, say in Firefox, does not show a URL, as it will with a link. Rather, I think, the browser will generate the URL from user-provided information on the page, depending on which revisions are selected. It's the same with Search. My workaround is to use any simple page link to open a new tab. Ideally, the page opened is short. I sometimes use my user page, or I can take the opportunity to glance at the Main page. Then I do the search from there. The problem is worse with History, really. It's particularly frustrating when browsing on a phone.... --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 19:09, 8 September 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Massei  Journeyings  Numbers 33:1-36

The Review of the Journeyings 
This  Parshas is called “Masei” which means “journeys.” This is of course associated with the segments of their journey out of Egypt to the Land of Israel and is a review of the stops they made along the way.
During the forty-year sojourn in the wilderness, the itinerary of the people from Egypt to Eretz Yisrael consisted of forty-two encampments. While most of them were on the journey forward, strangely enough, some were in the opposite direction, back to Egypt.  When the Jewish people submitted to Yahweh’s will, they moved forward, coming closer to their destination.  At times, however, they rebelled and wanted to return to Egypt and they went backward in their journey


The Wilderness Experience
Although Yahweh took them on a long journey and there were many stopping places, there were still periods of rest and blessing in spite of their rebellion and through it all He extended His mercy to them.   The first fourteen of their encampments were before spying out the land at Rithmah as it is called here (verse 18) and the last eight encampments were in the last year after Aaron’s death. (vs. 41-49).  Thus during the intervening thirty eight years there were only twenty encampments.

They were in Kadesh for 19 years. The rest of the time, the 19 years, they camped in 19 places, which average at one journey per year. Each of these encampments has a Hebrew name associated with it.  It is worthwhile to study the meanings of these names to gain insights as to the trials and obstacles Israel faced on her way to the Promised Land, how she faced those trials, whether she trusted in Yahweh or complained, and whether she trusted in Yahweh’s provision or in her own. 

Trials and testings are in store for those who follow the cloud of Yahweh.  There will be no physical rest and security, no comfort zones in the mundane, but only in Yahweh’s leading and faithfulness to meet our needs wherever He may lead us.  A stationary existence is the fate of those following the dictates of religious institutions which define the kingdoms of men.  On the other hand, for those who are following His Presence (His leading via the glory cloud) there is a constant pursuit of Him, constant growth, constant onward and upward movement.  Our faith needs to be grounded, not in men, institutions, creeds, rituals and doctrines but in the Creator of the Universe. Once in the Promised Land (in the new earth) the wanderings will cease.  Fix your eyes and keep them on the goal of the Promised land!

The 42 segments of the Hebrew’s journey had both “good” and “bad” moments, which were all part of their spiritual growth.  Even during the periods of trials and judgements Yahweh extended mercy to them.  Trials which can appear to be “bad” events in our journey can have a positive result if we align ourselves with Yahweh’s purpose of purifying us and conforming us to His image --  “And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who  have been called according to his purpose.” (Romans 8:28 - Read verse 29)

Sometimes we may “fail” at certain junctures of our spiritual journey.  This is where teshuvah (“repentance”) comes into play. Through repentance (teshuvah) an area of our life can become sanctified and we can rise to even greater spiritual heights than if we had not gone through this experience.  Keeping His commandments, brings life to us and blessing.  John 14:23-24

At Sinai they received the Torah which was given for this very reason to be a mirror we can all look into, which will expose sin as breaking His commandments.   James said, “But he who looks into the perfect Torah of liberty and continues in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in what he does.”  (James Ya’acov 1:25)


Our Personal Exodus
If we think in personal terms, these 42 stages can be said to mirror our own lives as we journey from our own personal “exodus from Egypt” toward our destination, which would be the spiritual counterpart of the Land of Israel.  The physical, mental and emotional trials that we pass through in life arise out of conflicts between the desires of the flesh and of the mind which are in conflict with His Word, the Torah.  Our journey takes us from bondage and slavery to these desires centred in the things of this world, through the wilderness where we reap the resulting judgement upon our carnal nature until we learn to die to our self nature, submit to Him and trust His Word to bring us into the “promised land” with all its blessings.

As the people progressed along the 42 legs of their journey, things did not necessarily get any “easier” for them. As they went forward, there were less and less “overt miracles” and more effort was required on their part. Note that the Torah tells us (in the “Shema” – Deuteronomy 6:5), “And you shall love Yahweh your God, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your resources.”  The Shema can also be seen as “going from easiest to hardest.”  First we love God emotionally, which can come with little effort. Then we seek Him out in study and prayer, which takes some labor on our part.  Finally we “put it on the line” by showing our love for Him is more important that material possessions and other things in this life and He becomes our all in all.


The Apportionment of the Land
Upon nearing the Land of Israel, the tribes of Reuben and Gad, plus a portion of Mannasah, indicated a desire to settle apart from the other tribes, outside the Land of Israel proper.  In writing down the borders of the land, the boundary is drawn along the Jordan river, even though the two and a half tribes obtained permission to dwell on the other side of the Jordan, the boundary was not extended to include them.   Later, when Israel went into exile, these same tribes were the first to be taken into captivity (I Chronicles 5:26). 
We are an easy target  for the enemy when we are outside the boundaries of what He has set for us, even though it may be ‘permitted’.   There is no protection afforded outside the defined boundaries and outside the place where His Presence dwells.

“ And you shall take of each tribe one prince to apportion the land” --  i.e. one prince from each tribe (Targum Johnathan 34: 17) 
“These are names of the men who will take possession of the land for you,”  (lachem):The word “lachem” here means, on your behalf. Each and every prince was a trustee for his tribe, and would divide the portion of his tribe to families and to individual men, and would select for each and every one an appropriate portion.  The princes made the allotments as if the members of their tribes had made them their representatives  --  i.e.   “they will apportion to you,” meaning that they would take possession “for you”, that is, on your behalf, and in your place.  The word “lachem” is used here as in, “Yahweh will do battle on your behalf.”   (34: 18)

The boundaries outlined by Moshe here take in the mountains of Lebanon, Damascus and Bashan, which is the present-day Golan Heights on the northern side.  The sea of Galilee is included in this and a little below it along the Yarmuk river which comes into the Jordan on the south-east side of the sea of Galilee.  The eastern boundary is the area east of the Jordan as far south as the Jabbok river near Jericho.  The southern border runs from the Dead Sea up to the ascent of Akrabbim, through the wilderness of Zin and south of Kadesh-Barnea.  The western boundary is the Mediterranean Sea.   The land was decreed to them by Yahweh in His promise to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob but did not come to fulfillment until those nations were deserving of judgement and were no longer entitled to the land because of their sins. Yahweh is just even in dealing with the sinful.  See Genesis 15:16

In Ezekiel 5:5 and 38:12, it says in the Hebrew that Yerushalayim is the navel of the earth, i.e. the center of the earth from which He will rule  -   “Yahweh will roar from Tziyon, and utter his voice from Yerushalayim” (Amos 1: 2).

Israel has never fully occupied the whole geographical area they were given.  Yahweh warned them that if they didn’t do as He said and drive the inhabitants out of the land, then they would be a pain and a snare and would continually harass them.   
“But if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, it will be that the residue whom you have spared looking at you with an evil eye will surround you as shields (terisin) on your sides, and afflict you in the land wherein you dwell; and it shall be that as I had thought to do to them I will do to you. “ (Targum Johnathan)
Their failure to do this caused them to reap the consequences and become corrupted and come under Yahweh’s judgement. Light and darkness cannot dwell together.  2 Corinthians 14-18


Entering the Land
“Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, When you cross the Jordan to the land of Canaan, you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you, and you shall destroy all their temples, all their molten images shall you destroy, and all their high places shall you demolish”   Numbers/Bamidbar: 33: 51-52   Moshe is told to enter the land of Canaan and drive out the people already living there so they don’t corrupt &amp; influence the people of Israel to whom He has given the land.  

Then they must destroy their ‘temples’ as the Targum Onkelos renders it, “their houses of bowing,” because they would cover the ground with a floor of marble stones, so as to prostrate themselves upon them with outstretched arms and legs,  to their images.  The term above for images is ‘maskit’; a cast-metal-idol  -   Thus, the term is maseikhah — molten (cast) image, derived from (nasakh), meaning “to pour,” including pouring of metal into a cast of an image.  It therefore refer to masks or moulds cast as representations of images.  It could appear that these images were cast into the flooring of their ‘temples’.

In a pagan society we are influenced in our daily lives by the world around us.  Whether work, TV, radio, friends, family or neighbors, or even the culture we live in and the government, influence our everyday lives.   The mould of idolatry is wrought into the fabric of life in an secular nation.   The sanctity of the nation of Israel could only be preserved by cleansing it of all corrupting influences.   Rashi comments on 33: 55 - Those of them whom you leave shall be... “ a cause of harm for you - As pins which pierce your eyes”; and ‘as thorn-hedges’ - “an enclosure of thorns, which covers you, to close off and confine you, without any who can go out or come in.”  Obviously sources of grief and pain which cause obstacles and restrictions to godly living.


Levitical Cities
The Levitical cities were given to the priests. but remained the property of the tribe in which they were placed.  Their apportionment did not make them self-sufficient, they were still dependant upon the generosity of the tribes amongst which they lived to meet their needs and they in turn served the communities in which they lived by instructing them and meeting their spiritual needs.   By living together in one locality they were able to strengthen one another and keep their spiritual traditions intact, and yet be a sanctifying influence in the area of Israel in which they were placed.
Rabbinic tradition says that the Levitical cities ceased to exist after the fall of the Second Temple in 70 AD.


The Cities of Refuge
The punishment of exile was meted out to one who is guilty of inadvertent manslaughter.  The Torah requires that such an individual flee to a city of refuge and remain there during the lifetime of the High Priest.  The murderer is safe from the victim’s avenger only if he remains in the city of refuge.  All who had sinned (murdered someone) unintentionally could flee there and find a safe haven until the wheels of justice could properly turn and the court mete out justice (35:9) .
The gates of these cities of refuge were perpetually open and never were closed to anyone for any reason. All who were in trouble and distressed could find rest there.

But if a person murders another person intentionally, or with malicious intent,  they are a murderer and are to be executed by the victims nearest relative.   The judges and elders were to receive no ‘ransom’  (kophar; related verbal noun to kipur - atone) for the one who committed such a deed - either to save his life or to allow him to return home. (35.31)  

Unavenged blood defiles the land (35:33-34).  How much more so the blood of innocent, murdered pre-born babies?  If the land cannot be cleansed by the blood of him who shed innocent blood then, how is the land redeemed now?   The defilement of the land brings a curse and subsequent judgement.   Modern methods of imprisonment do not cleanse the land from the defilement of blood-guilt.  Although having an appearance of mercy upon the offender, they do not execute just judgement and retribution.

The Provision for the Manslayer and the Judgement of the Murderer
The laws for determining murder from unintentional manslaughter.
* The slayer’s intention determines whether he is guilty
* No ransom is to be accepted for his guilt
* The verdict is determined by a legal court and not by the avenger
* The murderer is executed by the nearest of kin to the deceased, after a legal trial (the Sanhedrin)

But for the involuntary manslayer, he is confined to the city of refuge until the High Priest dies.
Fleeing to a city of refuge was not an escape from justice.  It was a place of refuge from the “blood avenger” which in the culture of the time had the legal right to “redeem” the life of his next of kin and avenge the death of his relative.  The manslayer was to await trial in the city of refuge and not escape the law.  The situation of an “unintentional” killing has to be judged by cross-examination and witnesses to determine the motive, both for the good of the accused and for the justice of the avenger.


Re death of High Priest and murderer
The Targum Johnathan holds the High Priest responsible for manslaughter occurring in the land due to either his prayers not being effectual on Yom Kippur, or his negligence to cover it in prayer.
Milgrom says that, “As the high priest atones for Israel’s sins through the cultic service in his lifetime, so he atones for homicide through his death.   Since the blood of the slain, although spilled accidentally, cannot be avenged through the death of the slayer, it is ransomed through the death of the high priest.”  (JPS op. cit. p.294)

The life of the High Priest was one of offering his life sacrificially to atone for the sin of the people and so also in his death his life was an atonement for the life of the one slain.  In this he was a type of our Great High Priest, Yeshua the Messiah. With the death of the High Priest, atonement was made for the life of the slain and the man-slayer was absolved of guilt.

“Whosoever kills a man, according to the word of witnesses fit to give testimony against him, the avenger of blood, or the house of judgment (Beit Din), shall put him to death. “  (Targum Johnathan)  
The Beit Din was the Body of elders that presided over matters of judgement.   It was to this that Yeshua referred in Matthew 18:17  in regard to members of the congregation who refused the counsel of witnesses regarding their sin.


Moshe’s Legacy to Israel
But now as Moshe is writing his final words, he is drawing to a finality the revelation of the Law/Torah to men in written form. This is the instruction manual in order to learn how to approach Yahweh in all of His holiness and to be able to live in an acceptable manner to Him.  In written form it was a set of instructions to follow which required the right heart attitude to fulfil it in the right spirit, so that it would not be just an outward form of acting the right way.   

Because the written Word can become just the “letter of the law” and in itself cannot impart life, Yahweh gave the promise of another covenant  where this ‘law’  would be written in the hearts of men so that it would come forth from the heart as a living reality, from their own motivation and within their own personality (2 Corinthians 3: 6; Romans 7: 6).  For that reason Yeshua came and lived the Torah, He was the expression - the manifestation of all that the Father is, the complete and perfect expression of the standard of His nature in human form.  He fulfilled the law/torah by supplying the living reality to the written form.  He is the Living Word and His Spirit is imparted to those who by faith come to Him to live the Torah by His empowerment.

Yeshua was a second “Adam”, initiating a second breed of “man” and all those who receive His life come into this new order of mankind.  Of course we know that no person who has descended from Adam with his fallen nature can ever fulfill the Law perfectly, but that does not mean that the Law should be done away with.  Yahweh has instituted spiritual laws in His Creation that are very much like the natural laws that keep the Creation from devolving into chaos, simple principles like gravitational forces, basic mathematics, laws of entropy and other physical laws reinforce the notion that there is a Creator who through omniscient wisdom and omnipotent power put order in the universe.  In a like manner, the principle of reaping what one sows  demonstrates most vividly the need for mankind to follow Yahweh’s instruction manual for living (Torah - the scriptures) the life we have been given on this earth, through the empowering of His Spirit.

“Hear, O Israel! Yahweh is our God,Yahweh is one! You shall love Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. These words, which I am commanding you today, shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your sons and shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise up. You shall bind themas a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontals on your forehead. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates” (Devarim/Deuteronomy6:4-9).

We need to be like the examples we have in Moshe, Caleb, Paul and John who spent their entire lives pressing forward for the mark of the high calling in the living Messiah of Israel.  Those who are not totally committed to their walk with the Messiah are going to be shortchanged when it comes to their reception with Yeshua at the end of the age. There are really only two greetings that will be received by those who are seeking to serve the Living Savior. The first is the one that all who know Him want to hear.  “Well done, good and faithful servant!”   Matthew25:21).

However, we do know that a number of people who are involved in religious activity will have another word spoken to them that is one that you would not ever want to hear coming from the Holy One of Israel.
“Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,'will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; but he who does the will of My Father Who is in Heaven. Many will say to Me on that day,'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?’ And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you who are working lawlessness'” (Matthew7:21-23).  Lawlessness is not being subject to His Law - the Torah.

These are sobering words that come from the mouth of the Messiah Himself.   He also said.  “Whoever then shall break one of these commandments,the least, and shall teach others to do so, he shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven. But whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven” (Matthew5:19).

We each have a choice everyday of our lives. Are we going to be like Caleb and press on to the mark and not let the giants of our world intimidate us?  Are we going to allow people we know to move us away from doing what the Scriptures tell us to do?   Or will we receive that  “well done, good and faithful servant”.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Now that you are familiar with the GarageBand interface you can learn how to use the loops that come with GarageBand and how to use these to create a song.

[[Image:Taking_loop.jpg|100px|thumb|Step 1]] 
[[Image:Loop_place.jpg|100px|thumb|Step 2]]
[[Image:Loop_done.jpg|100px|thumb|Step 3]]
[[Image:Reapeat_icon.jpg|20px|right]]

* To start, open the 'Loops Bank' panel. 
* Use the filters to filter out a certain loop, say a drum line. By clicking on the loop in the right side of the panel you can hear a preview of the loop. 
* When you have found the right loop, click and drag it into the working plane.  It's best to put it at the beginning of the song so the project stays ordered. 
* Next we can make the loop longer so our song will last a bit longer as well. Do this by clicking and dragging the right upper corner of the loop to the right until it’s long enough. If this is done right, the corner of the cursor turns into this icon. 
* Continue adding new loops and tracks and by using the 'play' button you can listen to your song. If want to add a loop but you already have the instrument track in your project drag the new loop to a position with in that track to add it instead of making a whole new track.
* For example, try putting a piano loop into the default piano track.
* Don't forget to &quot;file &gt; save&quot; your project every now and then so you can revert to it if you've messed things up.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The next step is to learn how to make and edit both software instrument and real instrument recordings.

[[Image:Detail_inst.jpg|300px|right]]
* 'Software instrument' recording means that a USB midi keyboard is used or the Musical typing function in GarageBand.
* Either plug in your USB keyboard or select &quot;Window &gt; Musical Typing&quot; and a window will open showing which keys of the keyboard you can use to play with. Make sure you leave this window open or musical typing won't work.
* Start by creating a new track with the ''''+'''' button and the detailed information window will pop up.
*# Make sure that the 'Software Instrument' tab is selected.
*# In this menu you can select the primary instrument.
*# In this menu you can select different types the primary instrument and its sound. 
*# Finish by clicking on 'Create'.
* Next you should make sure the 'Cursor' at the point that you want your recording to start. 
* Then if you want GarageBand to count a measure before you start, so you have the rhythm select &quot;Control &gt; Count in&quot;.
* To actually record press the red &quot;Record&quot; button and play away. To stop recording press the button again.
* When finished recording the recording acts just like any other loop and can be repeated or trimmed. You can trim a loop by clicking and dragging the right bottom corner of the loop.
* When you want to record in an already existing track, select it before recording.
* When you have finished the project you can export it to your &quot;iTunes&quot; library by selecting &quot;File &gt; Export To iTunes.

==How many people speak this language?==
Albanian language is spoken natively by about 8 million people, who live mainly in Balkans (the nations of Albania, Kosovo, FYROM, and Greece). Small communities of Albanian speakers are scattered throughout the world.

==Where is this language spoken?==
Albanian is spoken chiefly in [[Wikijunior:Europe/Albania|Albania]], [[Wikijunior:Europe/Kosovo|Kosovo]], [[Wikijunior:Europe/Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Wikijunior:Europe/Montenegro|Montenegro]] (official Language, spoken in the south, especially around Ulcinj), [[Wikijunior:Europe/Serbia|Serbia]], [[Wikijunior:Europe/Greece|Greece]], [[Wikijunior:Europe/Turkey|Turkey]], [[Wikijunior:Europe/Romania|Romania]] (spoken by a minority) and among Albanian refugees, emigrants, and exiles in Europe and North America.

==What is the history of this language?==
Albanian language is a branch in the Indo-European languages tree, which means that is distinctly related to English, Sanskrit, and other Indo-European languages. However, it does not share the same group with any other Indo-European language or any language in the world, although it has borrowed and given loanwords to Greek, Baltic, and Slavic languages.  The Albanian language has an ancient history. It is thought to have descended from the Pelasgo-Illyrian language spoken in Ballkan peninsula and it's surroundings. 

Albanian, at one point or another, was written in seven different scripts, two of which were created only to write Albanian. The oldest script in Albanian was written in the Latin (like English) script, and it was always used the most. However, the Greek alphabet was also popular from 1500-1850. Albanian was even written with an Arabic script. This was because Albania and some neighbouring countries were conquered by the Ottoman Empire, and the Arabic script was used by the Muslims well into the 20th century.

==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==

As regards the introductory page, shouldn't the chapter on Reading be under ''Section 1'' instead of ''Before you begin'' ?--[[User:Henry Dalton|Henry Dalton]] ([[User talk:Henry Dalton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Henry Dalton|contribs]]) 10:13, 8 March 2012 (UTC)

:No, no, I believe (since I am the inconsistent main editor at the moment even though I am also under 18) that, as a Bengali person myself, literacy is important in learning a language, and also the lessons (from the beginning) will use mostly exclusively Bengali text, so it would be pointless to begin if the reader does not know how to interpret the Eastern Nagari abugida. [[User:Mahir256|Mahir256]] ([[User talk:Mahir256|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mahir256|contribs]]) 19:22, 2 June 2012 (UTC)

Also, I think this book should contain a link to [[Wikijunior:Languages/Bengali]]? I verily believe that it is an excellent introduction to start with. Perhaps it should be added to the book as a chapter or a paraphrased page? --[[User:Henry Dalton|Henry Dalton]] ([[User talk:Henry Dalton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Henry Dalton|contribs]]) 10:13, 8 March 2012 (UTC)

:I will add a link, but the Wikijunior page should not be added as a chapter in itself: rather, the material in the page should be transferred where possible to the right sections. [[User:Mahir256|Mahir256]] ([[User talk:Mahir256|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mahir256|contribs]]) 19:22, 2 June 2012 (UTC)

Can this Wikibook have it's sections organised differently and added to by any user? I want to change the '''Before you begin''' category. The page শব্দ will be moved to Section 1 and '''Before you begin''' should contain links and summaries to and about the history, culture and online resources for Bengali.--[[User:Henry Dalton|Henry Dalton]] ([[User talk:Henry Dalton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Henry Dalton|contribs]]) 17:51, 8 March 2012 (UTC)

:It would not be worth it to have &lt;u&gt;any user&lt;/u&gt; re-organize the contents; that would create conflict in the system. As do many other language textbooks, cultural references are usually scattered throughout the book, so that is how it will be done. Regarding শব্দ, see the previous notes.

== Negative Present Tense ==

What about a sentence like ''હું એ ન કરું'' (hu e na karu)(I don't do that)? How does that fit in?

Vet and Bet are the same letter! The dagesh in Bet is a part of the Niqqud System.</text>

I really like the cursive guides on aleph/bet 1, but they aren't in other lessons. Could these be added?[[User:Lukeh713|Lukeh713]] ([[User talk:Lukeh713|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Lukeh713|contribs]]) 02:35, 24 January 2012 (UTC)</text>

== Vav ==

There is in fact no letter Vav in Hebrew. There is a Waw, which European Jews wouldn't pronounce. Likewise don't teach Ayin  only as like Aleph when it is actually the same as Ayn in Arabic, but again, European Jews would not pronounce it. Then there's Hhet like in the Arabic word Wahhad (one) and Hebrew Ehhad which is mispronounced as Echad as in the German sprache. The there's Rimel whis is like the Arabic Ghayin. &amp;c</text>
