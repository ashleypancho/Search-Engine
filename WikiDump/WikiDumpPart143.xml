Previous: [http://test.jmonkeyengine.org/wiki/doku.php/jme3#installing_jmonkeyengine_3 Installing JME3], Next: [http://test.jmonkeyengine.org/wiki/doku.php/jme3:beginner:hello_node Hello Node]

'''Prerequisites:''' This tutorial assumes that:

* You have [http://jmonkeyengine.org/wiki/doku.php/ downloaded the jMonkeyPlatform] (or set up the jMonkeyEngine3 in another IDE of your choice)
* You are have [http://test.jmonkeyengine.org/wiki/doku.php/sdk:project_creation created a Java SE project with the JME3 libraries on the classpath].

You are ready to create your first jMonkeyEngine3 game! You can generally use the tutorials in this introductory series with any integrated development environment (IDE), such as the jMonkeyPlatform, NetBeans, Eclipse, or run them straight from the commandline. In the following, we will use the jMonkeyPlatform.

== Writing a SimpleApplication ==
Create a &lt;tt&gt;jme3test.helloworld&lt;/tt&gt; package and a file &lt;tt&gt;HelloJME3.java&lt;/tt&gt; in it. 

In the jMonkeyPlatform, you right-click the Source Packages node:

* Select &lt;tt&gt;New… &gt; Java Class&lt;/tt&gt; to create a new file.
* Enter a class name: &lt;tt&gt;HelloJME3&lt;/tt&gt;
* Enter a package: &lt;tt&gt;jme3test.helloworld&lt;/tt&gt;
* Click Finish.

== Sample Code ==
Replace the contents of the HelloJME3.java file with the following code:

 package jme3test.helloworld;
 &amp;nbsp;
 import com.jme3.app.SimpleApplication;
 import com.jme3.material.Material;
 import com.jme3.math.Vector3f;
 import com.jme3.scene.Geometry;
 import com.jme3.scene.shape.Box;
 import com.jme3.math.ColorRGBA;
 &amp;nbsp;
 /** Sample 1 - how to get started with the most simple JME 3 application.
  * Display a blue 3D cube and view from all sides by
  * moving the mouse and pressing the WASD keys. */
 public class HelloJME3 extends SimpleApplication {
 &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;nowiki&gt;public static void main(String[] args){&lt;/nowiki&gt;
         HelloJME3 app = new HelloJME3();
         app.start(); // start the game
     }
 &amp;nbsp;
     @Override
     public void simpleInitApp() {
         Box b = new Box(Vector3f.ZERO, 1, 1, 1); // create cube shape at the origin
         Geometry geom = new Geometry(&quot;Box&quot;, b);  // create cube geometry from the shape
         Material mat = new Material(assetManager,
           &quot;Common/MatDefs/Misc/Unshaded.j3md&quot;);  // create a simple material
         mat.setColor(&quot;Color&quot;, ColorRGBA.Blue);   // set color of material to blue
         geom.setMaterial(mat);                   // set the cube's material
         rootNode.attachChild(geom);              // make the cube appear in the scene
     }
 }

Build and run the HelloJME3 class. If a jme settings dialog pops up, confirm the default settings.

# You should see a simple window displaying a 3-D cube.
# Use the WASD keys and the mouse to navigate around.
# Press Escape to close the application.

Congratulations, it works! How did we do that?

== Understanding the Code ==
The code above has initialized the scene, and started the game.

=== Understanding the Terminology ===

{| style=&quot;border-spacing:0;&quot;
| style=&quot;border:0.002cm solid #000000;padding:0.049cm;&quot;| &lt;center&gt;'''What you want to do'''&lt;/center&gt;
| style=&quot;border:0.002cm solid #000000;padding:0.049cm;&quot;| &lt;center&gt;'''How you say it in JME3 terminology'''&lt;/center&gt;

|-
| style=&quot;border:0.002cm solid #000000;padding:0.049cm;&quot;| You want to create a cube.
| style=&quot;border:0.002cm solid #000000;padding:0.049cm;&quot;| You create a Geometry with a 1x1x1 Box shape.

| style=&quot;border:0.002cm solid #000000;padding:0.049cm;&quot;| You set the Geometry's Material.

|-
| style=&quot;border:0.002cm solid #000000;padding:0.049cm;&quot;| You want the cube to appear in the scene.
| style=&quot;border:0.002cm solid #000000;padding:0.049cm;&quot;| You attach the cube to the rootNode.

|}
=== Initializing the Scene ===
In Java, the creation of a blue cube looks as follows:

     public void simpleInitApp() {
         Box b = new Box(Vector3f.ZERO, 1, 1, 1); // create cube shape at the origin
         Geometry geom = new Geometry(&quot;Box&quot;, b);  // create cube geometry from the shape
         Material mat = new Material(assetManager,
           &quot;Common/MatDefs/Misc/Unshaded.j3md&quot;);  // create a simple material
         mat.setColor(&quot;Color&quot;, ColorRGBA.Blue);   // set color of material to blue
         geom.setMaterial(mat);                   // set the cube's material
         rootNode.attachChild(geom);              // make the cube appear in the scene
     }

In the &lt;tt&gt;simpleInitApp()&lt;/tt&gt; method, you create or load all game objects before the game starts. The &lt;tt&gt;simpleInitApp()&lt;/tt&gt; method is automatically called once at the beginning of every JME3 game.

A typical JME3 game has the following initialization process:

# You initialize game objects:
** You create or load objects and position them.
** You make objects appear in the scene by attaching them to the &lt;tt&gt;rootNode&lt;/tt&gt;.
** '''Examples:''' Load player, terrain, sky, enemies, obstacles, and place them in their start positions.
# You initialize variables
** You set variables to their start values. 
** You want to use variables track the game state. 
** '''Examples:''' Set the &lt;tt&gt;score&lt;/tt&gt; to 0, set &lt;tt&gt;health&lt;/tt&gt; to 100%, and so on.
# You initialize keys and mouse actions
** The following input bindings are pre-configured by default:
*** W,A,S,D keys – Move around in the scene
*** Mouse movement and arrow keys – Turn the camera
*** Escape key – Quit the game
** Add your own keys and mouse clicks.
** '''Examples:''' Click to shoot, press Space to jump, etc.

=== Starting the Game ===
The HelloJME3.java class extends &lt;tt&gt;com.jme3.app.SimpleApplication&lt;/tt&gt;, which is a subclass of &lt;tt&gt;com.jme3.app.Application&lt;/tt&gt;. Every JME3 game is an instance of &lt;tt&gt;com.jme3.app.SimpleApplication&lt;/tt&gt;.

To run a JME3 game, you first instantiate your &lt;tt&gt;SimpleApplication&lt;/tt&gt;-based class, and then call its &lt;tt&gt;start()&lt;/tt&gt; method:

     &lt;nowiki&gt;public static void main(String[] args){&lt;/nowiki&gt;
         HelloJME3 app = new HelloJME3();
         app.start(); // start the game
     }

Typically you start a game from your Java application's main() method. 

== Conclusion ==
These few lines of code simply display a static 3D cube. You can navigate around in this 3D scene. 

You have learned that a SimpleApplication is a good starting point because it provides you with:

* A &lt;tt&gt;simpleInitApp()&lt;/tt&gt; method where you create objects.
* A &lt;tt&gt;rootNode&lt;/tt&gt; where you attach objects to make them appear in the scene.
* Useful default input settings that you can use for navigation in the scene.

When developing a game application, you will now want to:

# Initialize your game world,
# Trigger actions in the event loop,
# Respond to user input.

In the following tutorials you learn how accomplish these tasks with the jMonkeyEngine 3.

Continue with the [http://test.jmonkeyengine.org/wiki/doku.php/jme3:beginner:hello_node Hello Node] tutorial, where we will first show you more details about how to initialize the game world, also known as the scene graph.

In C language ,the function wcscmp is included in [[header file]] , [[wchar.h]].
The functions [[wcsncmp]] ,[[wcscmp]] , [[strncmp]] , [[strcmp]] are used to compare strings.
Function [[wcsncmp]], is similar to [[strncmp()]] , which is used to compare two fixed-size wide-character strings.
it looks similar to  [[strncmp()]]  .This function is  used to handle wide character strings. 
The  wcsncmp()  function  is the wide-character equivalent of the strncmp() function.
The function [[wcsncmp]] is similar to [[wcscmp]] ,but it compares only first n characters.

== Description==

[[Wcsncmp]] is the standard library function used to compare two wide character strings.
The function is similar to standard library function [[strcmp]]. But the comparison is not like [[strcmp]].
The  first difference is that the function wcsncmp compares the two strings upto some limit(at most n character) i.e  '''size_t n''' but [[strcmp]] compares the strings till '\0' occures.
and the second is that it handles wide characters as mentioned.
It compares the wide-character string pointed to by  say '''a''' and the wide character string 
pointed to by say '''b''', but at most  '''n''' wide characters from each string. 

If the wide character string '''a''' is greater than wide character string '''b'''
at first diffrentiating position i (i &lt; n)
then the function [[Wcsncmp]] returns positive integer and if second string is greater 
than first  at the first differing position i (i &lt; n), then the function wcsncmp  returns negative integer.
if the first i characters (i &lt; n) of '''a'''  and '''b''' are equal , the function wcsncmp returns 0.

== Required Header Files==

[[#include&lt;wchar.h&gt;]]&lt;br /&gt;
'''OR'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[#include&lt;string.h&gt;]]

==Syntax==
   [[#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;]]&lt;br /&gt;
   [[#include &lt;wchar.h&gt;]]&lt;br /&gt;
   int wcsncmp(const wchar_t *a, const wchar_t *b, size_t n);

==Brief Comparison==

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Function !! What it does !! Arguments
|-
| Wcsncmp || Compare first n characters of two wide character strings ||const  wchar_t  *a,  const  wchar_t  *b  ,  size_t  n
|-
| Wcscmp || Compare two wide character strings until '\0' occurs of one of the string || const  wchar_t  *a , const  wchar_t  *b
|-
| Strncmp || Compare first n characters of two (normal) character strings  || const  char  *a , const  char *b , size_t  n
|-
| Strcmp || Compare character strings until '\0' occurs of one of the string || const  char  *a  ,   const  char  *b

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{dewikify}}
In [[C language| C]], the function '''wcscat()''' is included in [[header file]] [[wchar.h]]. This function is quite similar to [[strcat]].&lt;br /&gt;
This function is used to concatenate two wide character strings.&lt;br /&gt;

==Syntax==
 #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;
 wchar_t *wcscat(wchar_t *a, const wchar_t *b);

== Description==

The job done by the functions [[strcat]] and Wcscat   is same as mentioned i.e concatenating two strings.. The difference is that the function [[strcat]] takes (normal)''' character strings ''' and wcscat takes '''wide character strings''' as arguments.&lt;br /&gt;
The function [[wcscat]] ,copy the  wide character string say '''b''' including '\0'(at the end of string b) , at the end of  wide character string say '''a'''.
The '\0' character of the string a is replaced by the first character of the string 'b'. I.e function append the sring 'b' to the end of string 'a'.
If  wide character string 'a' is &quot;hello&quot; and  wide character string 'b' is &quot;world&quot; . After calling the function wcscat(a , b) , string 'a' becomes &quot;helloworld&quot; and string 'b' remains same.  The  wide string 'a' must have memory of  at least  (strlen(a) + strlen(b) +1) bytes so that it can  store wcs(Wide character string) 'a' , wcs 'b' and '\0'.&lt;br /&gt;

== Sample Program==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;wchar.h&gt;
#define SIZE 32

int main() {

      wchar_t destination[SIZE] = L&quot;Hello&quot;; /*SIZE should be sufficient enough to store both strings and NULL termination '\0' */
      wchar_t * source  = L&quot; World&quot;;
      wchar_t * ptr;

      ptr = wcscat( destination, source );
      printf(&quot; %ls\n&quot;, ptr ); /* prints &quot;hello World&quot;*/
     /*OR printf(&quot;%ls\n&quot; , destination);*/

      return 0;

}
&lt;/source&gt;
Output  of program will be ' Hello World '.
&lt;br /&gt;
Wide character string 'source'(World) is appended at the end of wide character string 'destination'(Hello).

==Return Value== 

The function wcscat() returns pointer to  wide character string 'a' i.e pointer to the string which is concatenated.

In [[C language]] ,Function labs is included in header file [[stdlib.h]]. The [[abs()]] function computes and returns the absolute value of the integer argument i. The '''labs()''' function computes and returns the absolute value of the long integer argument, of the appropriate long integer type for the function. The '''llabs()''' function computes and returns the absolute value of long long integer argument.

==Description==
The labs() is a library function. It is used under [[#include&lt;stdlib.h&gt;]] header file. This function computes the absolute value of the long integer argument i. It also returns the absolute value of the argument. That is, if i is negative, the result is opposite of i, but if i is non-negative the result is i.

==Required header files==
[[#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;]]&lt;br /&gt;
[[#include&lt;stdlib.h&gt;]]

==Syntax==
[[#include&lt;stdlib.h&gt;]]&lt;br /&gt;
long int labs(long int i);

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{dewikify}}
The [[C language]] function calls '''mempcpy''' and '''wmempcpy''' are used to copy one area of memory to another area.

==Introduction==
In [[C language |C]], the function '''mempcpy''' is included in header file [[string.h]]. '''mempcpy''' is nearly identical to '''memcpy()'''. This function is used to copy the strings. The function '''wmempcpy''' is identical to mempcpy() but takes [[wchar_t]] type arguments and copies n wide characters. It comes under [[wchar.h]] header file.

==Description==
In [[C programming]], functions mempcpy() , wmempcpy() are used.The mempcpy() function is nearly identical to the memcpy() function.It comes under '''Buffer Manipulating Functions'''. It copies a specified number of characters from one buffer to another. It copies n bytes from the object beginning  at  src  into  the  object
pointed  to  by  dest.
But  instead of returning the value of dest it returns a pointer to the byte following the last written byte. This function is useful in situations where a number of  objects  shall be copied to consecutive memory positions. If copying between objects overlap, then the behavior is undefined.

==Return value==
dest + n.

==Example==
void *&lt;br /&gt;
combine (ciod *o1, size_t s1, void *o2, size_t s2)&lt;br /&gt;
{&lt;br /&gt;
void *result = [[malloc]](s1 + s2);&lt;br /&gt;
if (result != NULL)&lt;br /&gt;
[[mempcpy]]([[mempcpy]](result, o1, s1), o2, s2);&lt;br /&gt;
return result;&lt;br /&gt;
}

==Versions==
[[mempcpy]] first appeared in glibc in version 2.1

==See also==
memccpy( ), memcpy( )

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{dewikify}}
In C language ,the function wcscmp is included in [[header file]]  [[wchar.h]]
wcscmp is similar to [[strcmp]] i.e it is used to compare two strings.but the 
function wcscmp is used to compare wide character strings.
If two wide character strings say s1 and s2 are to be compared.
Then function wcscmp returns positive integer if s1 is greater than s2.
It returns negative integer if string s2 is greater than s1.
if two wide character strings i.e s1 and s2 are same then function returns 0.

== syntax ==

 #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;
       int wcscmp(const wchar_t *s1, const wchar_t *s2);
== Sample program which uses function wcsncmp==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;wchar.h&gt;
int main() {
        wchar_t string1[] = L&quot;char&quot;;
        wchar_t string2[] = L&quot;character&quot;;
        int difference;

        difference = wcscmp( string1, string2 );
        if ( difference == 0 )
                printf( &quot; Both strings are same&quot;  );
        else {
                if ( difference &lt; 0 )
                        printf( &quot; char is less than character\n&quot; );
                else
                        printf(&quot; char is greater than character\n&quot; );
        }
        return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Output of program will be 'char is less than character '&lt;br /&gt;
as value of difference is negative.

In  [[C Programming]] language , functions  [[wcsncmp()]] , [[wcscat()]] , [[labs]] , [[mempcpy]] are used. 
Function [[wcscpy]] ,is similar to [[strcpy()]] .strcpy() is used to copy strings whereas wcscpy() is used to handle wide strings for copying.   It copies the  wide-character  string  pointed  to  by  src,including  the  terminating L'\0' character,
to the array pointed to by dest.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[Unix]]-like operating systems, '''mprotect'''() is a POSIX system call for controlling memory protections. It sets protection for memory mapping. The function mprotect changes the access protection specified by the 
prot .&lt;br /&gt;
In the word 'mprotect', 'm' stands for memory and 'protect' for protection so, mprotect basically stands for memory protection. mprotect() is a protecting kind of a function. It's working is based on prot. Prot is just a parameter. The proction to access is provided by mprotect as specified by prot.Prot is the one which decide what kind of access is permitted. The access can be of just read, write, execute or even some combinations. However, the argurment to the parameter prot set compulsarily to PROT_READ or one or more of PROT_READ, PROT_EXEC. and PROT_WRITE. Access to the one's not specified by prot is also permitted; But the thing is different in case of PROT_WRITE and PROT_NONE.It is not permitted for write to succed where PROT_WRITE isn't set.Also access is not permitted where PROT_NONE is alone set without any other. 

Following values of prot can be implemented:-
PROT_NONE, PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE, and the inclusive OR of PROT_READ and PROT_WRITE

If mprotect fails and the error is not EINVAL then it indicates change in protection in the range(addr, addr + len).

== Header file ==
To use the mprotect function one need to include 'sys/mman.h' header file.

== Syntax==
 int mprotect(void *addr, size_t len, int prot);

== Parameter ==
addr : the starting address of memory for witch access is to changed.&lt;br /&gt;
len  : the length of address range in byte.&lt;br /&gt;
prot :  ptot may be PROT_NONE  or PROT_READ or PROT_WRITE or PROT_EXEC.&lt;br /&gt;

each of it has a special meaning 
*PROT_NONE  : the memory can not be assessed in any way.    
*PROT_READ  : the data of memory can be read.       
*PROT_WRITE : data can be modified by writing to it.
*PROT_EXEC  : the data of memory can be executed.

== Errors ==
Following are the common errors due to which mprotect() function will fail if:-

*EACCES 
*EAGAIN 
*EINVAL
*ENOMEM
*ENOMEM
*ENOTSUP

== Return values ==
Upon successful completion, mprotect() returns 0. Otherwise, it returns -1 and sets errno to indicate the error.

==Introduction of Internet of Things==
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technological revolution that represents the future of computing and communications, and its development depends on dynamic technical innovation in a number of important fields, from wireless sensors to nanotechnology.&lt;ref name= ITU&gt; International Telecommunications Union (2005). ITU Internet Reports 2005: The Internet of Things. Retrieved from www.itu.int/internetofthings/ &lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the internet of things is come from Massachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT)’s Auto-ID Center in 1999.&lt;ref name= dummies &gt; Patrick J. Sweeney, Patrick J. Sweeney (II.) (2005). RFID for dummies. Wiley Publishing, Inc. &lt;/ref&gt; The MIT Auto-ID Laboratory is dedicated to creating the Internet of Things using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Wireless Sensor Networks. The Internet of Things is a foundation for connecting things, sensors, actuators, and other smart technologies, thus enabling person-to-object and object-to-object communications.&lt;ref name= Architecting&gt; Uckelmann.D, Harrison.M, Michahells.F (2011). Architecting the Internet of Things. Springer Heidelberg Dordrecht London New York &lt;/ref&gt; A new dimension has been added to the world of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs): from anytime, anyplace connectivity for anyone, now we have connectivity for anything. Connections will multiply and create an entirely new dynamic network of networks, which is Internet of Things.&lt;ref name= ITU&gt; International Telecommunications Union (2005). ITU Internet Reports 2005: The Internet of Things. Retrieved from www.itu.int/internetofthings/ &lt;/ref&gt;

RFID techniques and related identification technologies will be the cornerstone of the upcoming Internet of Things. While RFID was initially developed with retail and logistics applications in mind in order to replace the bar code, developments of active components will make this technology much more than a simple identification scheme. In the not too distant future, it can be expected that a single numbering scheme, such as IPv6, will make every single object identifiable and addressable.&lt;ref name=roadmap&gt; Internet of Things in 2020: Roadmap for the future. (May, 2008) Retrieved from: http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/rfid/documents/iotprague2009.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; The technologies of the Internet of Things provide many benefits to the world. For example, sensor technologies are being used to test the quality and purity of different products, such as coffee in Brazil and beef in Namibia. 

However, the security and privacy issues need to be considered. Concerns over privacy and data protection are widespread, particularly as sensors and smart tags can track users’ movements, habits and ongoing preferences. To promote a more widespread adoption of the technologies underlying the Internet of Things, principles of informed consent, data confidentiality and security must be safeguarded.&lt;ref name= ITU&gt; International Telecommunications Union (2005).

==Architecture of Internet of Things==

The Internet of Things needs an open architecture to maximise interoperability among heterogeneous systems and distributed resources including providers and consumers of information and services, whether they be human beings, software, smart objects or devices. Architecture standards should consist of well-defined abstract data models, interfaces and protocols, together with concrete bindings to neutral technologies (such as XML, web services etc.) in order to support the widest possible variety of operating systems and programming languages.&lt;ref name=visions &gt; Vision and Challenges for Realising the Internet of Things, European Union 2010,ISBN 9789279150883. &lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture should have well-defined and granular layers, in order to foster a competitive marketplace of solutions, without locking any users into using a monolithic stack from a single solution provider. Like the Internet, the Internet of Things architecture should be designed to be resilient to disruption of the physical network and should also anticipate that many of the nodes will be mobile, may have intermittent connectivity and may use various communication protocols at different times to connect to the Internet of Things.&lt;ref name= NIC&gt; National Intelligence Council, Disruptive Civil Technologies — Six Technologies with Potential Impacts on US Interests Out to 2025—Conference Report CR 2008–07, April 2008, Online: www.dni.gov/nic/NIC_home.html. &lt;/ref&gt;

Internet of Things nodes may need to dynamically and autonomously form peer networks with other nodes, whether local or remote, and this should be supported through a decentralised, distributed approach to the architecture, with support for semantic search, discovery and peer networking. Anticipating the vast volumes of data that may be generated, it is important that the architecture also includes mechanisms for moving intelligence and capabilities for filtering, pattern recognition, machine learning and decision-making towards the very edges of the network to enable distributed and decentralised processing of the information, either close to where data is generated or remotely in the cloud. The architectural design will also need to enable the processing, routing, storage and retrieval of events and allow for disconnected operations (e.g., where network connectivity might only be intermittent). Effective caching, pre-positioning and synchronisation of requests, updates and data flows need to be an integral feature of the architecture. By developing and defining the architecture in terms of open standards, we can expect increased participation from solution providers of all sizes and a competitive marketplace that benefits end users. In summary, the following issues have to be addressed:

• Distributed open architecture with end to end characteristics, interoperability of heterogeneous systems, neutral access, clear layering and resilience to physical network disruption.

• Decentralized autonomic architectures based on peering of nodes.

• Architectures moving intelligence at the very edge of the networks, up to users’ terminals and things.

• Cloud computing technology, event-driven architectures, disconnected operations and synchronization.

• Use of market mechanisms for increased competition and participation.

==IPv6==
Today’s dominant Internet Protocol (IP), Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), which has only about 4.3 billion addresses, is not enough to satisfy the rising IP addresses demand due to exponential growth in the number of internet user.&lt;ref name= appleinc&gt; What is IPv6? (2011, June 01). In Apple Inc. Retrieved November 10, 2011, from http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4669 &lt;/ref&gt; This worsening address drought leads to the introduction of Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6),&lt;ref name= ccna&gt; Todd Lammle (2007). CCNA: Cisco Certified Network Associate Study Guide, Sixth Edition. &lt;/ref&gt; which was developed to solve the shortage of internet address. It is often referred to as “next-generation internet” because of its almost limitless IP addresses (3.4x10^38 addresses).&lt;ref name= whatsmyipaddr&gt; What is IPv6? (2000-2011). In What Is My IP Address.com. Retrieved November 15, 2011, from http://whatismyipaddress.com/ip-v6 &lt;/ref&gt; It serves the function of IPv4, but without the same limitations of IPv4. Besides numerous address spaces, the differences between IPv6 and IPv4 are in five major areas: Addressing and Routing, Security, Network Address Translation (NAT), Administrative Workload, and Mobility. IPv6 also offers remarkable capability in the area of multicasting technologies.&lt;ref name= opus&gt; What is IPv6? (2000). In Opus One. Retrieved November 4,2011, from http://www.opus1.com/ipv6/whatisipv6.html &lt;/ref&gt; 

===Addressing and Routing===
IPv6’s extremely large address space gives Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to have sufficient IP addresses to assign to every end system so that every IP device has a truly unique address. Another goal of this address space expansion is to improve the connectivity, reliability, and flexibility. The additional address space is also helpful in the core of Internet by reducing the size and complexity of the global routing tables.&lt;ref name= opus&gt; What is IPv6? (2000). In Opus One. Retrieved November 4,2011, from http://www.opus1.com/ipv6/whatisipv6.html &lt;/ref&gt;

===Security===
One of the goals of IPv6 is Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). The new Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) security protocols, Encapsulating Security Protocol (ESP) and Authentication Header (AH) are capabilities posses by IPv6 that IPv4 does not offer.&lt;ref name= opus&gt; What is IPv6? (2000). In Opus One. Retrieved November 4,2011, from http://www.opus1.com/ipv6/whatisipv6.html &lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, IPv6 mandates that security be provided through information encryption and source authentication. 

===Address Auto-Configuration===
IPv6 Auto-Configuration feature reduces the total time that use to configuring and managing the systems. This ‘stateless’ auto-configuration means that it is no more need to configure IP addresses for end systems, even via Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).&lt;ref name= opus&gt; What is IPv6? (2000). In Opus One. Retrieved November 4,2011, from http://www.opus1.com/ipv6/whatisipv6.html &lt;/ref&gt; This allows new equipment to communicate with the network once it is detected, which means devices are ready to use on demand, on the other word, plug-and-play. 

===Administrative Workload===
IPv6 improves communication and eliminates the need for NAT, through its automated configuration capabilities. 

===Mobility (Support for Mobile Devices)===
IPv6 hosts are not restricted by location. As its name suggests, Mobile IP allows a device to roam from one network to another without losing their established IP addresses.&lt;ref name= ccna&gt; Todd Lammle (2007). CCNA: Cisco Certified Network Associate Study Guide, Sixth Edition. &lt;/ref&gt;  

===Multicast Technologies===
IPv6 allows multiple addresses for hosts and networks, which means transmission of a single datagram to multiple receivers. This optimizes media streaming applications and allowing more data transmission to millions of locations. Except unicast communication, IPv6 defines a new kind of service, called “anycast”.&lt;ref name= opus&gt; What is IPv6? (2000). In Opus One. Retrieved November 4,2011, from http://www.opus1.com/ipv6/whatisipv6.html &lt;/ref&gt; Anycast communication allows the same address to be placed on more than one device so that when traffic is sent to one device addressed in this way, it is routed to the nearest host that shares the same address.&lt;ref name= ccna&gt; Todd Lammle (2007). CCNA: Cisco Certified Network Associate Study Guide, Sixth Edition. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Sensor==
The Internet of Things is a network of objects connected by things like sensors, RFID tags, and IP addresses. In this respect, sensors have a special role in the Internet of Things paradigm. According to the International Telecommunication Unit (ITU Report 2005), Internet of Things can be defined as a vision “... to connect everyday objects and devices to large databases and networks ... (using) a simple, unobtrusive and cost-effective system of item identification...”.

In the Internet of Things, sensors are the edge of the electronics ecosystem&lt;ref name=Edge&gt; Sensors empower the &quot;Internet of Things&quot; (May, 2010) Retrieved from: http://www.edn.com/article/509123-Sensors_empower_the_Internet_of_Things_.php &lt;/ref&gt;. Sensors allow the physical world to interact with computers, playing an important role in bridging the gap between the physical world and the virtual one. This allows a richer array of data, other than data available from keyboard and mouse inputs. Currently, the internet is full of information that has been input by someone at the keyboard. But the concept of Internet of Things will change that, because we are at an inflexion point where more Internet data originates from sensors rather than keyboard inputs.

A sensor is a device that can measure a physical quality and converts that physical quantity into a signal that can be read by an instrument or an observer. In the idea of the Internet of Things, the ability to detect changes in the physical status of things is also essential for recording changes in the environment&lt;ref name=Summary&gt; International Telecommunications Union (2005). ITU Internet Reports 2005: The Internet of Things Executive Summary. Retrieved from http://www.itu.int/osg/spu/publications/internetofthings/InternetofThings_summary.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;. Sensors collect data from the environment, such as vibrations, temperature, and pressure, among others, and convert them into data that can be processed and analyzed. This allows the Internet of Things to record any changes in the environment or an object.

For example, by having sensors installed on a bridge, the data collected can be used to estimate the number of cars that travel on the bridge, the traffic on the bridge at different times of the day, and the speed of the cars travelling on the bridge. This data can then be used for navigation systems, to allow programs or software to determine the fastest route, depending on the time of day.

Also, the sensors installed on to a bridge can be used to determine the safety of the structure of the bridge.  For example, the sensors can be made to detect the vibrations along each part of the bridge, to detect any impending failure or fault. By collecting such information, any problems such as damage to a structure can be detected early on and dealt with, before any problems arise.

Embedded intelligence in things themselves can further enhance the power of the network. This is possible because the information processing capabilities are devolved, or delegated, to the edges of the network. Embedded intelligence will distribute processing power to the edges of the network, and offers greater possibilities for data processing and increasing the resilience of the network. With embedded intelligence, the things or devices connected at the edge of the network can make independent decisions based on the input received at the sensors.

“Smart things” are difficult to define. However, the term implies a certain processing power and reaction to external stimuli. Advances in smart homes, smart vehicles and personal robotics are some of the leading areas. Research on wearable computing is swiftly progressing. Scientists are using their imagination to develop new devices and appliances, such as intelligent ovens that can be controlled through phones or the internet, online refrigerators and networked blinds. The Internet of Things will draw on the functionality offered by all of these technologies to realize the vision of a fully interactive and responsive network environment.

==RFID==
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a system that transmits the data of an object or a person using radio waves for identifying or tracking the object or person. It is done by first attaching a tag, known as the RFID tag, to the object or person. This tag will then be read by the reader to determine its identification information. &lt;ref name= Wiki&gt; Wikipedia Retrieved from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification &lt;/ref&gt;

It works much like a barcode, where a scanner scans the barcode and the information will be obtained from the barcode. However, barcode requires a line of sight in order to be scanned whereas RFID tags do not need a line of sight to be read. This means that RFID tags can be read even if the tag is kept in a box or a container, or kept in a pocket. This is because it uses radio waves. This is a huge advantage of RFID. Another advantage of it is that there is a type of RFID tag known as a passive RFID tag which does not require batteries to function. Its power supply comes from the radio energy transmitted by the reader. Other than that, hundreds of RFID tags can be read at a time, unlike the barcode where only 1 can be scanned at a time.&lt;ref name= Wiki&gt; Wikipedia Retrieved from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification &lt;/ref&gt;

It is often seen that RFID is a prerequisite of Internet of Things. This is because the Internet of Things is a network of objects connected together and if all everyday objects in the world are to be connected, we would definitely need a simple and cost effective system to do it. RFID is the solution to this problem.&lt;ref name= ITU&gt; International Telecommunications Union (2005). ITU Internet Reports 2005: The Internet of Things. Retrieved from www.itu.int/internetofthings/ &lt;/ref&gt; RFID tags are very simple and small enough such that it can be attached to everyday devices without being noticed. In terms of cost effectiveness, passive tags are said to cost starting from only US$0.05 each. This means that it is very cheap and is possible to be attached to huge amounts of everyday objects. Other than that, as said in the previous paragraph, there is a type of RFID tag known as a passive tag which does not require any batteries to function and gets its power supply from the radio energy transmitted by the reader. This will save the cost of batteries and we do not have to worry about batteries being worn out and replacing them. This will save us from much hassle of checking and replacing batteries. Other than saving trouble and cost, this also gives the tags infinite lifetime because they are completely dependent on the reader for power. As long as there is a reader, the tag will work. Another point stated in the previous paragraph is that hundreds of RFID tags can be read at a time. The RFID system was designed to be able to distinguish the different tags which are within range of the RFID reader. This means that there will be no mistake in the information which the tag provides and will not be jumbled up with information from other tags.
RFID tags can be integrated with sensors to send not only identification data but also valuable information.&lt;ref name=Tyrrhenian&gt; The Internet of Things: 20th Tyrrhenian Workshop on Digital Communications&lt;/ref&gt; A sensor will monitor the change of a physical status and convert it into a signal which will be stored by the RFID tag. When a reader reads a tag, the sensors information will be sent to the reader along with the identity of the object. This way, we can monitor changes in an object such as temperature, pressure or vibration. This allows us to avoid any disaster or safety hazard from happening. For example, if we were to tag the tyres of a vehicle with a pressure sensor and we assume that a workshop has a RFID tag reader, every time the vehicle enters the workshop, the reader will automatically read the tag and obtain the information of the pressure of the tyres. It will be able to identify a specific tyre which has too much or too little pressure and so we can either increase or decrease the pressure to prevent any mishap from happening.&lt;ref name= ITU&gt; International Telecommunications Union (2005). ITU Internet Reports 2005: The Internet of Things. Retrieved from www.itu.int/internetofthings/ &lt;/ref&gt;

==Security and Privacy==

The trend of having ever more objects included in the IT data flows and ever more connected devices, moving toward mobile and decentralized computing is evident. The Internet of things has become a new Era in this day and age. There is a need to have a solution to guarantee privacy and the security of the customers in order to have a widespread adoption of any object identification system. 

The security has been done as an add-on feature in most cases, and the feeling that the public acceptance for the internet of things will happen only when the strong security solutions are in place. This could be hybrid security mechanisms that for example combine hardware security with key diversification to deliver superior security that makes attacks significantly more difficult or even impossible. The selection of security features and mechanisms will continue to be determined by the impact on business processes.

The security and privacy issues should be addressed by the forthcoming standards which must define different security features to provide confidentiality, integrity, or availability services.

These are some security and privacy requirements with descriptions:

•	Resilience to attacks: The system has to avoid single points of failure and should adjust itself to node failures.

•	Data authentication: As a principle, retrieved address and object information must be authenticated.&lt;ref name= auth&gt; For RFID authentication see Juels, supra note 14, at 384 s; Rolf H. Weber/Annette Willi, IT-Sicherheit und Recht, Zurich 2006, at
284. &lt;/ref&gt;

•	Access control: Information providers must be able to implement access control on the data provided.&lt;ref name= IIler&gt; See also Eberhard Grummt/Markus Mu¨ ller, Fine-Grained Access Control for EPC Information Services, in: Floerkemeier/ Langheinrich/Fleisch/Mattern/Sarma, supra note 4, at 35–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

•	Client privacy: Measures need to be taken that only the information provider is able to infer from observing the use of the lookup system related to a specific customer.

The fulfillment of customer privacy requirements is quite difficult. A number of technologies have been developed in order to achieve information privacy goals. These Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PET) can be described in short as follow:&lt;ref name= Fabian&gt; Fabian, supra note 6, 61 s; Benjamin Fabian/Oliver Gu¨ nther,Security Challenges of the EPCglobal Network, Communications of the ACM, Vol. 52, July 2009, 121–125, at 124 s.&lt;/ref&gt;

•	Virtual Private Networks (VPN) is extranets established by close groups of business partners. As only partners have access, they promise to be confidential and have integrity. However, this solution does not allow for a dynamic global information exchange and is impractical with regard to third parties beyond the borders of the extranet.

•	Transport Layer Security (TLS), based on an appropriate global trust structure, could also improve confidentiality and integrity of the IoT. However, as each Object Naming Service (ONS) delegation step requires a new TLS connection, the search of information would be negatively affected by many additional layers.

==Conclusion==
In conclusion, Internet of Things is the concept in which the virtual world of information technology connected to the real world of things. The technologies of Internet of things such as RFID and Sensor make our life become better and more comfortable.

&lt;br /&gt;
The Basic Concept of Efficiency Wages:&lt;br /&gt;
An efficiency wage will exceed the market clearing wage for a given occupation. The intended purpose of this decision is to provide the worker with an incentive to labor effectively by decreasing the propensity to shirk or behave poorly.&lt;ref&gt;http://areweb.berkeley.edu/~perloff/PDF/effic.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scribbles==
From the Article: 
PUTTING BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS TO WORK: TESTING
FOR GIFT EXCHANGE IN LABOR MARKETS USING
FIELD EXPERIMENT&lt;br /&gt;

Efficiency wages may only have a noticeable effect for a limited duration, after which there is no discernible differentiation from the market clearing wage. 
Labor is like a commodity: There is a market clearing price for a which a worker is willing to put in the minimum effort required.  It is further assumed that there is a positive relationship between increased wages and the effort that they put forth (reciprocity).  Laboratory evidence supports this hypothesis (1366).  It is questionable as to whether or not this holds true in actuality when duration and adaptation are brought into consideration.  It appears that those offered higher wages (an efficiency wage) increased effort and productivity for a short time, only to sink to average levels later on. It is important to note that this is true in for a one-time work situation, not continued employment.  It seems that higher wages may not improve productivity, but may help to attract and retain high quality workers.
&lt;br /&gt;
From the Article:
THE  FAIR  WAGE-EFFORT  HYPOTHESIS  AND 
UNEMPLOYMENT* &lt;br /&gt;

Workers have an idea of the fair wage which is greater than the market clearing wage.  They will therefore provide only a fraction of normal effort.  The existence of efficiency wages provide a possible explanation for unemployment, as they exceed market clearing wages and limit the number of possible hires (likewise, the negative correlation between skill and unemployment).  If a wage is below the perceived wage, the laborer will lower actual effort or adjust their non-pecuniary perception of the job.  The effect of overpayment may be psychological rather than resulting in actual improvements in labor.  Simply put, underpaid worker get angry.  They may feel resentment towards higher paid workers and offer a declining level of service to customers if they interact directly.  Inequity among workers can create strife, lower morale and productivity (particularly if they are of the same labor group).  If a firm must pay high wages to one group of workers in order to attain skilled individuals, it is likely that wages throughout the firm will rise.
&lt;br /&gt;
From the Book: 
Animal Spirts&lt;br /&gt;
Firms cannot fully monitor their employees; therefore workers can work or shirk. In an economy where there is no unemployment, there is no incentive to work.  Firms pay extra, reducing shirking but resulting in unemployment. Falls in unemployment result in rises in shirking.  &lt;br /&gt;
Alternatives to Efficiency Wages:
* Seniority Rights: If a worker builds benefits during his tenure in a given occupation, he will be persuaded to work efficiently because all other jobs would not provide the same benefit.  
* Reputation:  Educated workers may find that the cost of shirking is the cost of their education; job loss due to poor performance will result in difficulty finding work in any other firm because of a tarnished reputation.  The time any money spent on school will be useless in this situation.  &lt;br /&gt;
It is likely that the relationship between an employee and the employer is more complicated that the simple exchange of a wage for labor.  There is a sense of duty that laborers feel to complete their tasks.  If they feel that they are being unfairly compensated, the will shirk or sabotage.  If they feel they are being more than fairly compensated, they will fully buy into the goals of the company.  Therefore, the decision of whether or not to shirk is dependent on the cost to do so and how fairly to laborer feels they are being treated.  &lt;br /&gt;
Low or unfairly distributed wages will result in the sensation that necessary tasks do not fall on any specific individual (a result of complex interactions between laborers within the workplace.

==Labor as a Commodity==
Labor, being a good that can be traded, is very much a commodity. Like other tangible goods and services, there is a market clearing price for which the demand and supply for labor will be in equilibrium. &lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0262.2006.00707.x/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this is the price for which a worker is just willing to trade his labor for income, meaning that only the minimal amount of effort will be exerted.  In this situation, a worker may shirk responsibilities that are felt to be unwarranted at the market clearing price, or wage. &lt;br /&gt;
The theory of efficiency wages suggests that there is a positive relationship between wages which exceed the market clearing wage and the level of effort that a worker reciprocates to their employer.&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0262.2006.00707.x/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In turn, it is postulated that the effort and therefore productivity of a worker will increase along with their wages.

==Basic Model==

The basic concept of efficiency wages can be explained mathematically using the formula below.  In order for a wage to increase the efficiency of a worker:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;θ(α-β) &gt; G&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
where:
&lt;br /&gt;
* θ represents the likelihood that a worker will be caught and punished for unsatisfactory labor
* α represents the efficiency wage
* β represents the going market clearing wage
* G represents the value a worker places on providing only the minimum necessary effort
&lt;br /&gt;
A worker will choose the benefit, '''G''', of supplying the minimum level of effort his occupation requires in the case that their employer fails to provide a wage '''α''' large enough to render the risk of release, '''θ(α-β)''', greater than or equal to the benefit of slacking on the job.  The efficiency wage '''α''' must exceed the market clearing wage '''β''' so that the cost associated with losing one's job is greater than the benefit of supplying minimum effort.  If the wage '''α''' does not exceed '''β''', a worker can simply move to a different firm within the industry and maintain a constant level of utility while enjoying the benefits of minimal effort.&lt;ref&gt;http://areweb.berkeley.edu/~perloff/PDF/effic.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Test==
In an experiment organized by Uri Gneezy and John list, two mutually exclusive groups of individuals, say A and B, were asked to digitize a library's catalog. Both A and B were promised a wage of $12 an hour for six hours of labor.  Upon arrival, however, group A was instead offered a wage of $20 an hour, 167% of group B's wage.  Initially, the generosity of the wage was reciprocated by the individual laborers of group A- information processed by A exceeded that of B by nearly 25%, suggesting greater effort.  After ninety minutes time, productivity slipped to levels which were indistinguishable from that of group B.&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0262.2006.00707.x/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>instruction cache size matters</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In early computers, program memory was expensive. Programmers spent a lot of time minimizing the size of a program to fit it into the limited memory available. Thus the combined size of all the instructions needed to perform a particular task, the code density, was an important characteristic of any instruction set.&lt;ref&gt;
{{wikipedia|code density}} [[Wikipedia: code density]]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Even today, it makes a large difference whether or not the vast majority of instructions executed fit into the [[Microprocessor Design/Cache#Split cache|instruction cache]], which is by many orders of magnitude smaller than main memory.

In the early decades of CPU development, people gradually added more and more &quot;powerful&quot; instructions to the instruction set,
reducing the total number of instructions stored to implement common tasks,
but increasing the average [[Microprocessor_Design/Instruction_Set_Architectures#instruction_length | number of bits required to store each instruction]] -- in many cases this improves overall code density.
After the development of on-chip instruction cache,
the RISC revolution was led by people who sacrificed code density and eliminated complex, &quot;powerful&quot; instructions in order to simplify and speed up CPU implementation and improve performance on other CPU performance metrics.
More recently, some people have been experimenting with minimal instruction set computers (MISC), making the number of bits per instruction much shorter, in an attempt to improve code density.

For processors with variable-length instructions, it helps code density if frequently-used instructions are short, even if that forces other (rarely-used) instructions to be long.

For processors with fixed-width instructions, choosing 16-bit-wide instructions appears to give slightly better code density than 8-bit or 32-bit-wide instructions.&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;It seems that the 16-bit ISA hits somehow the &quot;sweet spot&quot; for the best code density, perhaps because the addresses are also 16-bit wide and are handled in a single instruction. In contrast, 8-bitters need multiple instructions to handle 16-bit addresses.&quot;
-- [http://embeddedgurus.com/state-space/2009/03/insects-of-the-computer-world/ &quot;Insects of the computer world&quot;] by Miro Samek 2009.
&lt;/ref&gt;

As typical RAM sizes increased, and
after the development of the separate instruction cache large enough to contain inner loops and common subroutines
(so code density had much less effect on [[Microprocessor Design/Performance Metrics | CPU performance metrics]]),
and after the invention of nested subroutines and threaded code and other instruction-set-independent executable compression techniques,&lt;ref&gt;
[[Data Compression/Executable Compression]]
&lt;/ref&gt;
code density has become a less important part of [[Microprocessor Design/Instruction Set Architectures | instruction set architecture]].

== Bitcoin ==
Bitcoin (BTC) is a recent decentralized electronic currency that is used in online transactions between two parties.  It continues to be a substitute for online transaction with the goal of one day being the primary online currency.  The main benefit that BTC continues to make known is the removable of a central bank to process transactions and the use of cryptography to verify each transaction.  It was released in 2009, by Satoshi Nakamoto (possibly a pseudonym) and since then it has had a slow start at gaining popularity.  The design of BTC is considered to be sophisticated and bullet-proof to hackers and abuse.  Bitcoins are primarily used for online transactions with the exception of a few establishments able to do BTC-to-Dollars exchanges (and other national currencies).  There has been negative criticisms that BTC has had dealt with, including abuse from attackers of the network in efforts to try to find weaknesses and other possible faults described below.  There has also been good response from the increase in users, merchants, traders using the electronic currency to sell their products and increase their BTC profits.

== Breakdown ==
'''Getting Started'''

'The first step to enter the market of bitcoins is to download the free software available to anyone on various websites.  Bitcoin is currently available to MAC and Windows user and as of mid-2012 it has released its 0.6.2 version.  Once the software is installed a user must obtain a bitcoin wallet to be able to store their wealth.  There are a variety of wallets not including the one provided by the software, which can give the user a more sense of security over their currency and that offer additional benefits.  Some of these bitcoin wallets are InstaWallet, and flexcoin.  As an example, flexcoin serves as an online bank where you are able to store your money and have access from various online devices such as mobile applications and multiple computers. &lt;ref&gt;Flex Coin The bitcoin bank, http://www.flexcoin.com/, Retrieved May 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;  Once the software is installed users can begin to obtain BTC using a variety of methods. 

'''Mining'''

New BTC are generated and enter the network's eco-system through a process called &quot;mining.&quot;  The term &quot;mining&quot; is used because it assimilates the real-life work that miners perform to extract minerals.  Users competing in Bitcoin mining run computerized programs that solve puzzles in return for new BTC.  The creation of BTC is much more complex when analyzed in depth.  The process of mining generates &quot;blocks,&quot; at a predetermined rate based on the number of miners in the network.  An amount of data tracking the time consumed by the computer running cycles to solve difficult problems, or a new block, is known as “proof-of-work”.  This proof-of-work helps regulate the number of blocks released (as of May 2012 at one block every ten minutes for the whole network)&lt;ref&gt; Barber, Simon, Xavior Boyen, Elaine Shi, and Ersin Uzun. &quot;Bitter to Better — How to Make Bitcoin a Better Currency.&quot; Print. Palo Alto Research Center, University of California-Berkeley, pg4.&lt;/ref&gt;., as well as the validity of the block.  This proof-of-work tracks and secures the validity of each BTC preventing double spending.  When a miner creates blocks, they are able to charge transaction fees for that blocks information and receive bitcoin transaction fees from vetting.  The idea that for currency to have value there must be a finite amount, Bitcoin minting is set so that the number of BTC released approximates but never reaches 21 million.  The number of bitcoins entering the economy is reducing as more blocks are created(as more miners enter the network), and will continue to do so until its max is reached.  It is estimated the the maximum number of bitcoins circulating the economy will be reached in 2029.&lt;ref&gt;Grinberg, Reuben. &quot;Bitcoin: An Innovative Alternative Digital Currency.&quot; HASTINGS SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY LAW JOURNAL 4.1 (2011): 164+. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mining has the potential to be very lucrative, if the user is able to supply a high power computer to solve the problems, since there is double payout in doing so: one with the minting of BTC and second with the transaction fees charged for using blocks.
Users can also increase their BTC wealth by establishing themselves as merchants, selling products in the BTC market, or purchasing directly from a seller.  There is no set exchange rate of bitcoins-to-US dollars( or other national currency), so the value of bitcoins fluctuates based on the exchange rate of the market.  At one point a single bitcoin was worth 30 USD before crashing and setting at approximately 2 USD in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt; Barber, Simon, Xavior Boyen, Elaine Shi, and Ersin Uzun. &quot;Bitter to Better — How to Make Bitcoin a Better Currency.&quot; Print. Palo Alto Research Center, University of California-Berkeley, pg1.&lt;/ref&gt; Other common ways to earn bitcoins is by participating in surveys, or rating products, finding free bitcoins online, joining mining groups, and other ways that payout out small quantities of BTC.

'''Transactions'''

When a users signs up to the BTC network they are issued a sets of crypto-keys.  Also known as public-key cryptography these keys allow for users to safely transfer BTC among one another without the risk of being duplicated or misused. The public key is embedded with the information of the owner of the bitcoin, and also serves as a tool to track and verify the genuineness of that single coin.  When a transaction takes place, the owner attaches the key information (bitcoin address) of the receiver and waits for a miner to validate the coin(s).  Validating the authenticity of the bitcoins being transferred requires the information embedded in the second key.  The process to transfer BTC using public-key cryptography has assured BTC users and merchants of the piece of mind they can have when transferring and receiving currency.  Once this piece of mind can be established in the users of bitcoin, the user can feel comfortable making multiple transactions that lead to an increase in the network. 

'''Merchants''' 

As of October 2011 there was an estimated 20 million BTC users, with a about $20 million USD worth in BTC.&lt;ref&gt;Grinberg, Reuben. &quot;Bitcoin: An Innovative Alternative Digital Currency.&quot; HASTINGS SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY LAW JOURNAL 4.1 (2011): 160. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today you can buy software, alpaca socks, servers and many other products using BTC.  The number of transactions have also begin to increase as more BTC enter the economy.   Bitcoins also offers merchants the ability to capitalize using the electronic currency.  Merchants must pay transaction fees for the use of running a credit card at the point of sale.  Transaction fees can vary, but in 2008 financial institutions pocketed around 48 billion USD charging merchants these transaction fees.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Stacy. &quot;Soaring Credit Card Transaction Fees Squeeze Independent Businesses.&quot; Institute for Local Self-Reliance. Banking, Independent Business, 5 May 2009. Web. 28 May 2012.http://www.ilsr.org/soaring-credit-card-transaction-fees-squeeze-independent-businesses/&lt;/ref&gt;  Bitcoin has pushed for the use of their currency by promoting the low transaction cost that merchants pay for the use of BTC.  These low transaction fees can result in merchants increasing their profits.  Merchants have the option of managing each and every transaction or can also use third parties that can manage their accounts.  The increases in small transactions, also known as Micropayments, have the potential to benefit merchants if the customer finds it beneficial to make multiple transactions.    

A [[w:Micropayment|micropayment]] is a term to describe a financial payment system in which a low per-unit price is offered to consumers.  The low price is offered in order to entice consumers to purchase multiple amounts or items.  As such the system must have a large network of users for the concept to be affective.  Examples exist in different types of networks: 
*'''Real''': Subway/Public transportation systems, Gift-card, University meal plans
*'''Virtual''': ITunes, ESPN, Online multiplayer games
*'''Sponsored''':  One party in the transaction will have control over the network

== Network Externalities ==
Bitcoin can be considered an open network by definition, because as long as you have a computer and Internet access, you may download Bitcoin and begin to make use of it.  There is no reason to conclude that there is a set administrator that prevents anyone from downloading and installing it and the software is free. BTC is considered a peer-to-peer network because the information generated from the mining of any block becomes public, and through the publication of such information the network prevents fraudulent activity by keeping everyone accountable.  The latter is possible with the use of very sophisticated encryption for the transactions being performed between both parties.  This also leads to conclude that the network is sponsored since there is a creator of BTC, which continue to release updated versions.  To renforce the latter the network is maintained by a community of open source developers. &lt;ref&gt;We Use Coins, http://www.weusecoins.com/getting-started.php, Retrieved May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
The use of BTC is a one-sided network just like the US dollar and any other national currency.  There is user ‘A’ using BTC to purchase a good/service from user ‘B’.  The increase use of BTC, has also allowed other user to enter this network platform such as flexcoin.  The managing of BTC from flexcoin allows users to use this third party source to facilitate process of the transaction.  Bitcoin has served as network with various multiple parties using BTC for different purpose, creating positive network externalities.  It can be argued that it is a multi-sided network, but since its primary purpose is, and continues to be, a medium of exchange (money) it has the nature of a one-sided network.
As more online users begin to use BTC as a mean of exchange of goods and services, the more useful the BTC become to each user, leading to demand-side economies of scale.  The increase in users, whether its merchants, consumers, traders, etc., will attract more non-users to join the network for a variety of reasons that each see beneficial.  As of this writing in May 2012, Bitcoin is still in the beginning stages, but it is one of the most popular online virtual currencies.  The benefit from using BTC can come in the way of more merchants entering the market and offering BTC as a form of payment.  Currently the amount of merchants offering BTC as a payment option is very small, since its exchange rate for actual money is not stable.  This also leads to a collective lock-in, because it is hard for an aggregate amount of people to do the switch do to the lack of popularity, trust and other barriers.  Today using a credit card or PayPal to purchase goods is still more beneficial to everyone, then making a switch to a small network such as BTC.

== Cons ==
The downside to BTC has been its lack of popularity among other concerns that have arise since its establishment in 2009.  There has been a few attacks and glitches in the code that have lead to contamination of BTC. Such was the case of recent problems such as an overflow of transactions in a block in August 2010, and invalid transactions in micropayments in September of the same year. &lt;ref&gt;Bit Coin Project 2009-2012, http://bitcoin.org/, Retrieved May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the start of BTC there has been a handful of updated version to correct problems that may erupt in the software.
Another level of concern is the possibility of cyber-criminals using BTC and abusing it like regular currency.  Since there are no specific ways to track who and where is using BTC in transaction, and with the absence of a central bank system that BTC lacks, the FBI has demonstrated concern that cyber-criminals will use it for illicit activities.  This creates a problem for investors since there is no &quot;state enforcer&quot; looking out for the criminals and their BTC wealth. Unlike the United States dollar which is to some degree backed up by the government, BTC only has the confidence of the users to rely on.  If confidence is lost in the currency, perhaps by the entrence of a new virtual currency, then BTC has the potential to fail.  It is argued that the hoarding of BTC can also be a barrier for BTC to succeed.  The possibility to create bitcoins is diminishing with time and as more users enter the network.  Making them more valuable in the future and incentivizing owner of BTC to reframe from using them today to have greater wealth in the future.  The latter in a large scale can cause BTC to downfall with less bitcoins in circulation driving users away.  Many national currencies have the backing of their government that can instill confidence, a peace of mind, and seance of security for personal wealth.  Bitcoin unfortunately still lacks all three.  Other issues such as inflation, deflation, money supply, etc., that currencies are affected both positive and negativelly and that BTC still lacks can play a role in the future of BTC and its success.

== Review 2/7/2011 ==

This is a well written piece, and is written in a way that is easy to understand. I think one thing that I would like to see as a reader is information about actually conducted tests of these experiments or ones similar to them. How well do these predict peoples behavior given the situation?

== TDang review April 2012 ==

I'm reviewing [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Background/Nash_equilibrium&amp;diff=2314616&amp;oldid=2312647 this version]. I'll likely be more critical than complimentary, because (a) that's the way I am and (b) that's what will help improve things. Please don't take the criticism-over-compliments to mean I have a wholly negative view.

Make sure to check the [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#review_thoughts_April_2012|all-purpose review thoughts]] as well.

* I moved this page from ''Nash equilibrium and coordination games'' to just ''Nash equilibrium'' (to include other selected games). That's because I think including public goods games on this page would also be worthwhile. Those are structurally the same as [[w:prisoner's dilemma|], but are more specifically interpreted.
* So, doing something with a public goods / voluntary contribution game would help here.
* Once those are included, some restructuring of the introduction would also be in order.
* ''&quot;In all games matrices there are two pure strategy and two mixed strategy results.''&quot;--This paragraph is incorrect, in a number of ways.
*# First, it's wrong about what mixed strategy means. I don't anticipate using mixed strategy in this book, and it's not very important for the games that this page will discuss, so leaving out mixed strategy altogether is probably a good approach.
*# Second, it's important to separate the ''definition of the game'' as represented in the table from the ''solution/prediction'' which Nash equilibrium will find. The game exists separate from the Nash equilibrium.
* ''Nash equilibrium''--This section needs to be phrased very carefully. It's a bit confusing now. I don't think we want to give the formal mathematical definition, but what we give should be equally rigorous.
* That's about the right amount of experiments on coordination games. Unless there's something which clearly connects the experiments to the kind of things we're interested in (information goods, network externalities) we don't want to fill up too much on experiments.
* ''References''
** A google search is not a good reference, in fact it breaks Wikibooks' spam filter. Here;s an alternative link: http://www.uh.edu/econpapers/RePEc/hou/wpaper/2006-01.pdf
** Try to use the references with all appropriate information, with the author and title being more important than the university they're from.
** It looks like both of your references were to &quot;working papers&quot;. If possible, it's better to use a paper which has been published. (It's possible those papers have been published, and you can reference the published versions.)
* I was working from the principle that this page shouldn't get much bigger. It still shouldn't get ''much'' bigger, but expansing to include a public goods game, and maybe a public goods game with a provision point would be worthwhile.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cournot competition''' is an economic model used to describe industry structure. It so called after [[w:Antoine Augustin Cournot|Antoine Augustin Cournot]] (1801-1877) after he observed competition in a spring water duopoly. It has the following features: 

* There are two firms producing homogeneous products; 
* Firms do not cooperate.  
* Firms have market power; 
* There are barriers to entry; 
* Firms compete in quantities, and choose quantities simultaneously; 
* There is strategic behaviour by the firms; 

Price is a commonly known decreasing function of total output. All firms know N and take the output of the others as given. Each firm has a cost function ci(qi) (cost per unit multiply quantity). Normally the cost functions are treated as common knowledge. The cost functions are normally the same for all firms. The market price is set at a level such that demand equals the total quantity produced by both firms.

==Graphically finding the Cournot duopoly equilibrium==
:p1 = firm 1 price, p2 = firm 2 price

:q1 = firm 1 quantity, q2 = firm 2 quantity

:c = marginal cost (assumed to be constant)

Equilibrium prices will be:
:p1 = p2 = P(q1+q2)

This implies that firm i’s profit is given by &lt;math&gt;\Pi\ i = qi(P(q1+q2)-c)&lt;/math&gt;

*Calculate firm 1’s residual demand: Suppose firm 1 believes firm 2 is producing quantity q2. What is firm 1s optimal quantity? Consider the diagram 1. If firm 1 decides not to produce anything, then price is given by P(0+q2)=P(q2). If firm 1 sets produces q1’ then price is given by P(q1’+q2). More generally, for each quantity that firm 1 might decide to set, price is given by the curve d1(q2). The curve d1(q2) is called firm 1’s residual demand; it gives all possible combinations of firm 1’s quantity and price for a given value of q2.

[[Image:economics_cournot_diag1.png]]

*Determine firm 1’s optimum output: To do this we must find where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Marginal cost (c) is assumed to be constant. Marginal revenue is a curve - r1(q2) - with twice the slope of d1(q2) and with the same vertical intercept. The point at which the two curves intersect corresponds to quantity q1’’(q2). Firm 1’s optimum q1’’(q2), depends on what it believes firm 2 is doing. To find an equilibrium, we derive firm 1’s optimum for other possible values of q2. Diagram 2 considers two possible values of q2. If q2=0, then firm firms residual demand is effectively the market demand, d1(0)=D. The optimal solution is for firm 1 to choose the monopoly quantity; q1’’(0)=q&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;  (q&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; is monopoly quantity). If firm 2 were to choose the quantity corresponding to perfect competition, q2=qc P(q&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;)=c, then firm 1’s optimum would be to produce nil: q1’’(q&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;)=0. This is the point at which marginal cost intercepts the marginal revenue corresponding to d1(q&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;).

[[Image:economics_cournot_diag2.png]]

*It can be shown that, given the linear demand and constant marginal cost, the function q1’’(q2) is also linear. Because we have two points, we can draw the entire function q1’’(q2), see diagram 3. Note the axis of the graphs has changed, The function q1’’(q2) is firm 1’s reaction function, it gives firm 1’s optimal choice for each possible choice by firm 2. In other words, it gives firm 1’s choice given what it believes firm 2 is doing.

[[Image:economics_cournot_diag3.png]]

*The last stage in finding the Cournot equilibrium is to find firm 2’s reaction function. In this case it is symmetrical to firm 1’s as they have the same cost function. The equilibrium is the interception point of the reaction curves. See diagram 4.

*The prediction of the model is that the firms will choose [[Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Background/Nash_equilibrium_and_coordination_games#Nash_equilibrium|Nash equilibrium]] output levels.

==Calculating the equilibrium==

In very general terms, let the price function for the (duopoly) industry be &lt;math&gt;P(q_1+q_2)&lt;/math&gt; and firm i have the cost structure &lt;math&gt;C_i(q_i)&lt;/math&gt;. To calculate the Nash equilibrium, the best response functions of the firms must first be calculated.

The profit of firm i is revenue less cost. Revenue is the product of price and quantity and cost is given by the firm's cost structure, so profit is (as described above):
&lt;math&gt;\Pi\ i = P(q_1+q_2).q_i - C_i(q_i)&lt;/math&gt;. The best response is to find the value of &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; that maximises &lt;math&gt;\Pi\ i&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;q_j&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;i \ne \ j&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. given some output of the opponent firm, the output that maximises profit is found. Hence, the maximum of &lt;math&gt;\Pi\ i&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; is to be found. First derive &lt;math&gt;\Pi\ i&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \Pi\ i }{\partial q_i} = \frac{\partial P(q_1+q_2) }{\partial q_i}.qi + P(q1+q2) - \frac{\partial C_i (q_i)}{\partial q_i}&lt;/math&gt;

Setting this to zero for maximisation:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \Pi\ i }{\partial q_i} = \frac{\partial P(q_1+q_2) }{\partial q_i}.qi + P(q1+q2) - \frac{\partial C_i (q_i)}{\partial q_i}=0&lt;/math&gt;

The values of &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; that satisfy this equation are the best responses. The Nash equilibria are where both &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt; are best responses given those values of &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt;.

si===An example===

Suppose the industry has the following price structure: &lt;math&gt;P(q_1+q_2)= a - b(q_1+q_2)&lt;/math&gt;  The profit of firm i (with cost structure &lt;math&gt;C_i(q_i)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial ^2C_i (q_i)}{\partial q_i^2}=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial C_i (q_i)}{\partial q_j}=0, j \ne \ i&lt;/math&gt; for ease of computation) is:

&lt;math&gt;\Pi\ i = \bigg(a - b(q_1+q_2)\bigg).q_i - \partial C_i(q_i)&lt;/math&gt;

The maximisation problem resolves to (from the general case):

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \bigg(a - b(q_1+q_2)\bigg) }{\partial q_i}.qi + a - b(q_1+q_2) - \frac{\partial C_i (q_i)}{\partial q_i}=0&lt;/math&gt;

Without loss of generality, consider firm 1's problem:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \bigg(a - b(q_1+q_2)\bigg) }{\partial q_1}.q1 + a - b(q_1+q_2) - \frac{\partial C_1 (q_1)}{\partial q_1}=0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \ - bq_1 + a - b(q_1+q_2) - \frac{\partial C_1 (q_1)}{\partial q_1}=0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \ q_1 = \frac{a - bq_2 - \frac{\partial C_1 (q_1)}{\partial q_1}}{2b}&lt;/math&gt;

By symmetry:

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \ q_2 = \frac{a - bq_1 - \frac{\partial C_2 (q_2)}{\partial q_2}}{2b}&lt;/math&gt;

These are the firms' best response functions. For any value of &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt;, firm 1 responds best with any value of &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies the above. In Nash equilibria, both firms will be playing best responses so solving the above equations simultaneously. Substituting for &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt; in firm 1's best response:

&lt;math&gt;\ q_1 = \frac{a - b(\frac{a - bq_1 - \frac{\partial C_2 (q_2)}{\partial q_2}}{2b}) - \frac{\partial C_1 (q_1)}{\partial q_1}}{2b}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \ q_1* = \frac{a + \frac{\partial C_2 (q_2)}{\partial q_2} - \frac{\partial C_1 (q_1)}{\partial q_1}}{3b}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \ q_2* = \frac{a + \frac{\partial C_1 (q_1)}{\partial q_1} - \frac{\partial C_2 (q_2)}{\partial q_2}}{3b}&lt;/math&gt;

The Nash equilibria are all &lt;math&gt;(q_1*,q_2*)&lt;/math&gt;. This yields a market price of 5a/3.

==Implications==
* Output is greater with Cournot duopoly than monopoly, but lower than perfect competition. 
* Price is lower with Cournot duopoly than monopoly, but not as low as with perfect competition.

==Bertrand versus Cournot==
* Although both models have similar assumptions, but both have very different implications.
* Bertrand predicts a duopoly is enough to push prices down to marginal cost level, meaning that duopoly will result in perfect competition.
* Neither model is ‘better’, it depends on the industry as to which is more accurate.
* If capacity and output can be easily changed, Bertrand is a better model of duopoly competition. Or, if output and capacity are difficult to adjust, then Cournot is generally a better model.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bertrand competition''' is a model of competition used in economics, named after [[w:Joseph Louis François Bertrand|Joseph Louis François Bertrand]] (1822-1900).  It describes interactions among firms (sellers) that set prices and their customers (buyers) that choose quantities at that price. 

The model rests on the following assumptions:

* There are at least two firms producing homogeneous (undifferentiated) products; 
* Firms do not cooperate;
* Firms compete by setting prices simultaneously; 
* Consumers buy everything from a firm with a lower price. If all firms charge the same price, consumers randomly select among them.

== Calculating the classic Bertrand model ==
*MC = Marginal cost
*p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = firm 1’s price level
*p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = firm 2’s price level
*p&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = monopoly price level

* Firm 1's optimum price depends on where it believes firm 2 will set its prices. Pricing just below the other firm will obtain full market demand (D), though this is not optimal if the other firm is pricing below marginal cost as that would entail negative profits. In general terms, firm 1's [[best response]] function is p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;’’(p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), this gives firm 1 optimal price for each price set by firm 2.

* Diagram 1 shows firm 1’s reaction function p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;’’(p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), with each firm's strategy on each axis. It shows that when P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is less than marginal cost (firm 2 pricing below MC) firm 1 prices at marginal cost, p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=MC. When firm 2 prices above MC but below monopoly prices, then firm 1 prices just below firm 2. When firm 2 prices above monopoly prices (P&lt;sup&gt;M&lt;/sup&gt;) firm 1 prices at monopoly level, p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=p&lt;sup&gt;M&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[Image:economics_bertrand_diag1.png]]

*Because firm 2 has the same marginal cost as firm 1, its reaction function is symmetrical with respect to the 45 degree line. Diagram 2 shows both reaction functions.

[[Image:economics_bertrand_diag2.png]]

*The result of the firms' strategies is a [[Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Background/Nash_equilibrium_and_coordination_games|Nash equilibrium]], that is, a pair of strategies (prices in this case) where neither firm can increase profits by unilaterally changing price. This is given by the intersection of the reaction curves, Point N on the diagram. At this point p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;’’(p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;’’(p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). As you can see, point N on the diagram is where both firms are pricing at marginal cost.

Another way of thinking about it, a simpler way, is to imagine if both firms set equal prices above marginal cost, firms would get half the market at a higher than MC price. However, by lowering prices just slightly, a firm could gain the whole market, so both firms are tempted to lower prices as much as they can. It would be irrational to price below marginal cost, because the firm would make a loss. Therefore, both firms will lower prices until they reach the MC limit.

== Implications ==
* Note that colluding to charge the monopoly price and supplying one half of the market each is the best that the firms could do in this set up. However not colluding and charging [[marginal cost]], which is the non-cooperative outcome is the only Nash equilibrium of this model.

* If one firm has lower average cost (a superior production technology), it will charge the highest price that is lower than the average cost of the other one (i.e. a price ''just'' below the lowest price the other firm can manage) and take all the business. This is known as [[limit price|&quot;limit pricing&quot;]]

== Bertrand competition versus Cournot competition==
*While reviewing Oligopoly theory, Bertrand found that the creator of Cournot Competition, Augustin Cournot, while comparing quantities between firms had come to an incorrect conclusion. Bertrand recalculated the Cournot model using prices instead of quantities and proved that the equilibrium price was simply the competitive price. 

*According to Cournot, each firm selects a quantity to produce for some time period, then the combined total output between the firms will then determine the market price. 

*According to Bertrand's method, each firm selects a price as each firm's goal is to maximize their profits, given the price it believes its competitor, the other firm, will produce.

* Bertrand predicts a duopoly is enough to push prices down to marginal cost level; a duopoly will result in an outcome exactly equivalent to what prevails under perfect competition.

* Neither model is necessarily &quot;better.&quot; The accuracy of the predictions of each model will vary from industry to industry, depending on the closeness of each model to the industry situation.

* If capacity and output can be easily changed, Bertrand is generally a better model of duopoly competition. Or, if output and capacity are difficult to adjust, then Cournot is generally a better model.

* Under some conditions the Cournot model can be recast as a two stage model, where in the first stage firms choose capacities, and in the second they compete in Bertrand fashion.

== Critical analysis of the Bertrand model ==
* The classic Bertrand model assumes firms compete purely on price, ignoring non-price competition. Firms can differentiate their products and charge a higher price. For example, would someone travel twice as far to save 1% on the price of their vegetables? The Bertrand model can be extended to include product or location differentiation but then the main result - that price is driven down to marginal cost - no longer holds.

* The model ignores capacity constraints. If a single firm does not have the capacity to supply the whole market then the &quot;price equals marginal cost&quot; result may not hold.

* The classical model only focuses on the pure strategy Nash equilibrium. There are mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium with positive economic profits (see Kaplan &amp; Wettstein, 2000, and Baye &amp; Morgan, 1999).

* The classical model ignores search cost of consumers. If the consumer does not know the price of the product before visiting a firm and each visit is costly (however small), then a Nash equilibrium price will not arise. This creates the possibility that firms will randomly price at some point between marginal cost and the monopoly price.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Commitment devices seek to align short-term behavior with consciously desirable long-term goals. Often times the short-term costs associated with an action do not properly reflect its marginal effect on long-term costs. Employing commitment devices increases the short-term cost of perceived bad behavior to stay on track to achieve long-term goals. The most explicit way to do this is to draw up a contract where an individual promises to act positively in the short-term (in pursuit of a long-term goal) or else be forced to pay a predetermined amount to another party. 

Notes from A Dual Self Model of Impulse Control by Drew Fudenberg and David K. Levine
* People do not view time consistently. When given the choice between a greater quantity tomorrow and a lesser quantity today, many people will choose the lesser quantity. When given the same quantities, but in a year and a year and a day, almost everyone chooses the larger quantity. 
* There are not multiple selves which compete for dominance, but a single self with two subsystems - one preoccupied with maximizing short-run utility and the other with long run utility.
* The short run self is indifferent to the decisions of the long run self.
* “The idea of self-control is paradoxical unless it is assumed that the psyche contains more than one energy system, and that these energy systems have some degree of independence from each other.”  
(McIntosh [1969])

      <text xml:space="preserve">Typically for a good to be made and introduced into the market, a firm creates an intellectual property (IP), to go along with the good.  This is done so that the owners of that good have recognized rights under the law. By creating an IP, the creators can safeguard their profits from competitors who seek to simply copy the property. Traditional IP creation does require filing for patents and possibly trademarks. Filing for patents, defending your them, and ultimately maintaining an IP comes at the cost of time and money. &lt;ref name=utilitypatent&gt;http://www.uspto.gov/patents/process/index.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatives do exist for entities that want to innovate without resorting the traditional IP model however.  It is imperative to note that these alternatives still legally produce an IP and thus still have protection under copyright law; the key differences lie on the legal ownership of the IP and the types of rights  granted under copyright law. &lt;ref name=arstechnica&gt;http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2008/08/court-violating-copyleft-copyright-infringement.ars&lt;/ref&gt; Below are some alternatives to the traditional IP approach towards innovation.

== Open Source ==
Open source means a source is free to access and edit. However, it is not exactly the same as public domain. but they are not the same thing.The key difference is that open source has some restrictions on using and redistribution. Wikibooks is extremely proper example of open source. Wikibook has its policy on copyright, so it is a open source. Wikibooks offers a free media for users to discuss and share ideas easily and conveniently. People from very different places can communicate opinions, so innovation gets a bigger chance to occur. Another good example is open source software. Opens source software (OSS) is computer software that is available in source code form: the source code and certain other rights normally reserved for copyright holders are provided under an open-source license that permits users to study, change, improve and at times also to distribute the software.A report by the Standish Group states that adoption of open-source software models has resulted in savings of about $60 billion per year to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;^ Rothwell, Richard (2008-08-05). &quot;Creating wealth with free software&quot;.[http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/creating_wealth_free_software]. Free Software Magazine. Retrieved 2012-04-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Today almost every organization has open source technology somewhere in their IT
environment, usually in the form of Linux. For example, &quot;most of the cloud infrastructure is based on the open source LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) stack&quot;&lt;ref name=opensource&gt;Yves de Montcheuil. Open source has become mainstream but still drives innovation. [http://www.zdnet.com/news/open-source-has-become-mainstream-but-still-drives-innovation/6361287]. Zdnet. Retrieved 2012-5-2&lt;/ref&gt;. &quot;It’s not only because open source technology works well in this context, but also because the open source licensing model makes it easier on cloud providers to scale their infrastructure&quot;&lt;ref name=opensource/&gt;. Linux is using the GNU GPL which is a form of copyleft. Copyleft requires all versions to be free, so Linux is still free though a programmer creates his own version of Linux.

== Academic ==
Some researchers care more credits than profits. Academic process is to promote innovation based on that point. Especially for students in high level education institutions, they particularly worry about their credits. Good credits not only help a master to graduate but also help him or her find a satisfying job or higher level education institutions. There is a new movement for &quot;open access academic journals&quot;. However, &quot;the idea that research should be freely available is easy to support in theory, but it is a transition that will require a shift in how research journals are financed&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Y. Johnson. Harvard panel pushes benefits of free journals. [http://www.boston.com/yourtown/cambridge/articles/2012/04/28/harvard_pushes_back_against_academic_publishers_pricing_encourages_open_access/?page=2]. Retrived 2012-5-3&lt;/ref&gt;. Academic process is might one of the ways to help this movement. Researchers are more motivated by credits rather than profits. Nash Equilibrium Theorem is an example of an academic producing.&quot;Game theory, with the Nash equilibrium as its centerpiece, is becoming the most prominent unifying theory
of social science&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. H. and Alvin E. R. The Nash equilibrium: A perspective. [http://kuznets.harvard.edu/~aroth/papers/HoltRoth.nash_perspective.pdf]. Retrived 2012-5-3&lt;/ref&gt;. Nash also won 1994 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for this great innovation.

Academic endeavors are covered under copyright law and treated like most IPs due to how most academic fields place a strong emphasis on authorship.  The manner in which this authorship is expressed varies between the academic fields however. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ams.org/profession/leaders/culture/culture&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9268280 &lt;/ref&gt; As the goal of academic endeavors is not mainly of a financial nature, as long as authorship is maintained there are typically no issues. In this vein, some universities have been pressuring for faculty to submit articles in open access journals. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.boston.com/yourtown/cambridge/articles/2012/04/28/harvard_pushes_back_against_academic_publishers_pricing_encourages_open_access/&lt;/ref&gt; Open access in this context means providing free, unrestricted access to peer reviewed academic journals. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/overview.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic ==
Artistic incentives mean a person is working for love but is not for profit. Though some artists cannot make any money for their special type of arts, they never give up, because they love what they do. Those people are important for innovation. Every popular trend starts with an unknown thing. An information network example is Yahoo Answers which is a community for internet users. Some questions are solved without requirement of consulting professional people, so money is saved. Answers do not answer questions for money but for enjoying to help others.Moreover, another good example is nonprofit arts organizations. &quot;At present, there are more than 170,000 nonprofit arts organizations in the database&quot;&lt;ref&gt;DEBORAH A. KAPLE. Current Data Resources on Nonprofit Arts Organizations. [http://abs.sagepub.com/content/45/10/1592.full.pdf]. Princeton University. Retrived 2012-5-3&lt;/ref&gt;. The Santa Clara Vanguard is one of those organizations. &quot;The Santa Clara Vanguard has expanding outward from the drum and bugle corps activity to offer programs throughout the local community that support the arts and education while continuing to teach the fundamentals of excellence, tradition, and integrity that the Santa Clara Vanguard was founded with 45 years ago&quot;&lt;ref&gt;In the Community. [http://www.scvanguard.org/community/]. Retirved 2012-5-3&lt;/ref&gt;. Many significant artistic products disappeared if they are not supported by these non-profit art organizations. To improve employees' interest of their jobs is a good method to obtain innovation.   

Like the endeavors in academia, the driving force behind these projects has the main project goal be something other than financial gain.  For artistic endeavors, the main objective is art for art's sake.  An information network example is deviant art, a network where individuals are encouraged to post their artwork. &lt;ref&gt;http://about.deviantart.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prize incentives ==
Prizes are awards to be given to a person or a group of people to recognize and reward actions or achievements, which &quot;have been used throughout history as a means to foster innovation and solve problems&quot;&lt;ref name=insearch&gt;Josh Cleveland. &quot;In Search of Innovation: Prize Incentives for International Development&quot;.[http://www.nextbillion.net/blogpost.aspx?blogid=2122]. Nextbillion. Retrieved 2012-4-27.&lt;/ref&gt;. It is usually offered by wealth organization or government. An attractive prize can highly push people to work harder and better. If a prize is created to devote people to be innovative, then people are encouraged to create useful new things. Nobel Prize is a good example of prize incentives to encourage people to invent innovation. To earn Nobel Prize is almost a dream for every writer. A writer is somehow encouraged to be creative.  The classic example dates back to 1714, when the British government offered a prize for discovery of a method for determining longitude. &quot;Today, prizes have become an increasingly common tool, with recent examples including the Netflix Prize ($1 million for an algorithm predicting movie preferences)and Ashoka's Changemakers competition (grants for new development programs)&quot;&lt;ref name=insearch/&gt;

There are a wide variety of examples for prize incentives acting as the driving force for innovation within information goods.  The independent games festival encourages innovation in indie video games with its different type awards.  While a game may for example come up with innovative ways to utilize audio in video games for example. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.igf.com/02finalists.html&lt;/ref&gt;  It should be noted that the creators of the indie games still retain their IP, and thus could still go the traditional IP route even if the initial motivation was to win the award.  For a pure award incentive, the Open Source Awards promote projects that do not follow the traditional IP approach to innovation. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.packtpub.com/open-source-awards-home&lt;/ref&gt;

== Patronage ==
Patronage is the support, encouragement, privilege, or financial aid that an organization or individual bestows to another.  Royal writers and royal painters are good examples that artists are encouraged to innovate by patronage. They are supported by royal wealthy family.  &quot;The great artists of the Italian Renaissance were accountable to wealthy entities who became their patrons or gave them commissions&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Neal Stephenson. The lack of respect. [http://interviews.slashdot.org/story/04/10/20/1518217/neal-stephenson-responds-with-wit-and-humor]. Slashdot. Retrieved 2012-5-3&lt;/ref&gt;. Many North Korean painters are supported by governments. They do not paint for money but for their countries. Basically, most of their paintings advertise their governments' positive image. Thus, artists who are supported by patronage are somehow restricted to their products. Nowadays, patronage is less common than it was. Henry writes that &quot;the word ' patron ' in the present day has somewhat grown into contempt, because in former times it was too much the custom for pedantic dabblers in art to attempt to bring themselves into prominence with the public by pretending to foster the talent of students, or, by attracting them into their own exclusive circle, to shine with a borrowed light at a small outlay&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Henry C. Lunn. Patronage. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/3353557.pdf?acceptTC=true]. Musical Times. Retrvived 2012-5-4&lt;/ref&gt; .However, some new forms of patronage are invented as the development of internet continues. Kickstarter is a website which helps people find patronage. Patronage which is Non-IP approaches to innovation is still important. Neal indicates that &quot;the publishing industry still works for some lucky novelists who find a way to establish a connection with a readership sufficiently large to put bread on their tables, but this is not true for a great many other writers who are every bit as talented and worthy of finding readers&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Neal Stephenson. The lack of respect. [http://interviews.slashdot.org/story/04/10/20/1518217/neal-stephenson-responds-with-wit-and-humor]. Slashdot. Retrieved 2012-5-3&lt;/ref&gt;. Patronage becomes a helpful alternative for those unlucky talented artists. 

Whereas an IP-approach normally produces a mass market product which caters to all, products from a patronage approach typically cater only to the individuals that purchase them.  A form of patronage which still exists is that of an entity commissioning an artist online.  Commissioning an artist online may involve going to an art network like Deviantart or going to an individual's website. &lt;ref&gt;http://takusi.deviantart.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://flashygoodness.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt; Comicartcommissions.com is a network that pairs artists looking for commissions with entity's looking to commission. &lt;ref&gt;http://comicartcommissions.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kickstarter ==
Kickstarter is a website that matches projects in search of funding with individuals who might be interested in providing those funds.  Essentially somebody makes their pitch on an idea they would like funding for on kickstarter and if the idea is popular it will receive money to “kickstart” that idea. A variety of project are represented in Kickstarter with examples being  card games and films. Basically Kickstarter is a funding platform. Moreover, &quot;on Kickstarter, book proposals have attracted from as much as $85,000 (for a memoir about psychedelic visionary Terence McKenna, to be written by his younger brother) to as a little as $324 (to commission original cover art for a self-published e-book)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Miller. [http://www.salon.com/2011/10/05/your_favorite_author_brought_to_you_by_a_wealthy_patron/singleton/]. 4 October, 2011. Retrieved on 24 April 2012. &lt;/ref&gt; Since more and more eBooks are available, some writers won’t be able to earn money by sales of their books. Though writers could obtain a lot by sales of books before, some of them have to choose this kind of form to support their life

In order to incentivize funding, rewards are given depending on how much money is given.  However, if the funding goal is not met no one gets charged and the project gets no money from kickstarter.  The funding goals share many similarities with provision point mechanisms. A provision point mechanism, also known as threshold payoffs or assurance contracts,  is a situation where a specific amount of money is announced to all the potential beneficiaries of the public good as the minimum amount needed to provide the good. &lt;ref&gt;Bagnoli, Mark and Lipman, Bart. 1989. Provision of public goods: Fully implementing the core through private contributions. Review of Economic Studies. 56, 583-601.&lt;/ref&gt; By combining a patronage like approach where many people fund a  project before it is complete and a provision point mechanism in the form of a funding goal; Kickstarter is able to mitigate some of the risks of producing innovative niche ideas and generally greatly rewards innovative ideas with mass appeal. 

Kickstarter is a sponsored closed network (the projects are monitored to make sure that not just any idea goes through).  Kickstarter is also a two sided platform; the two sides here are the people who fund the projects, and the people who need funding.   There are also definite network externalities on both sides of the network.  According to the Kickstarter staff, there are many people who browse Kickstarter in search of projects to fund, it would make sense that more projects being provided would give these browsers more variety to choose from.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq/creating%20a%20project&lt;/ref&gt;  In a similar vein, if more individuals browse kickstarter to fund projects the more funds will be available to project makers.

==Copylefts==
In addition to copyrights, there are copylefts. Copyleft is a general method for making a program (or other work) free, and requiring all modified and extended versions of the program to be free as well (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/). The simplest way to make a program free software is to put it in the public domain, uncopyrighted. This allows people to share the program and their improvements, which is especially useful in the software creation process, where anybody can add to a new program, which strengthens the overall network, giving the consumers high demand side economies of scale, because as more people add to the software, the better it becomes.

&quot;The first form of CopyLeft licensing is called the GNU General Public License (GPL)&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Hu. CopyLeft. [http://e107copyleft.blogspot.com/p/examples-of-copyleft.html]. Retrvived by 2012-5-4&lt;/ref&gt;. It is originally used by Linux, and used by many softwares such as Mozilla, Java and so on. Sourceforge is a famous website that offers copyleft software. &quot;The second form of CopyLeft Licensing is the Creative Commons ShareALike License&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Hu. CopyLeft. [http://e107copyleft.blogspot.com/p/examples-of-copyleft.html]. Retrvived by 2012-5-4&lt;/ref&gt;. This form is more common in art community.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Social networking is a phenomenon not relating to computers specifically, but made entirely possible by the likes of them.  A social network is a way to stay connected to other people from anywhere in the world at all times over the internet.  Social networking platforms vary by your preference of communication.  Some of the more popular social networking platforms include Twitter, which requires the messages its users broadcast to their networks to be under a certain(small) character limit; Myspace, which has adapted a more music-entwined approach to capture a certain demographic; Facebook, the successor of Myspace as the most popular and massive network; and internet monolith Google's G+ platform(a Facebook competitor focusing on dividing your network into specific groups).  All of the major networks are accessible from various sources such as a smartphone, a computer, even some TV's.

In addition to that Social Networking Sites are used to communicating with existing friends or making new friends, it also allows you to post photos, videos, music and other contents for friends. Furthermore, chatting with friends who are online is also possible through Social Networking Sites. On the other hand, today Social Networking Sites are even used as business marketing tool, by the help of which businesses, political candidates, emerging musicians, and other professionals or professional organizations make their presence online. Even, Social Networking Sites are designed for business networking which can in fact help to develop a business. LinkedIn is one of the Social Networking Sites used to for recruiting employees, finding new jobs, and building professional networks and other business related activities. Hence, today whole world is joining these Social Networking Sites with the help of which they can stay connected to friends or relatives residing in any corner of the world. Among all the Social Networking Sites Facebook has highest number of users today.

== Security risks associated with social networking ==
[[File:Facebook.svg|thumb|Facebook]]

Nowadays, nearly everyone has access to an ever-popular Facebook or Twitter account. Social networking makes it easy to post personal information to the web. Whether it be as little as posting a family picture or as much as posting a home address, any and all information must be posted with caution. One of the most simply (yet tricky for some) is to simply avoid adding too many personal details about yourself on the web.

Here are a few thoughtful links of security risks on social networks:

==Internet Edge Introduction==

What is internet edge? Internet edge is considered a edge of a network and look at the electronic components with what we are using including computers,personal digital assistants(PDAs),cellphones,smartphones,tablets ,and other devices that we use on our daily lives.The computers and other electronic devices that connected to the Internet are often known as end systems.The reason why they are called as end systems because they are situated at the edge of the Internet.

The end-to-end principle is a classic design principle of computer networking which states that application specific functions ought to reside in the end hosts of a network rather than in intermediary nodes, provided they can be implemented &quot;completely and correctly&quot; in the end hosts. First explicitly articulated in a 1981 conference paper by Saltzer, Reed, and Clark,it has inspired and informed many subsequent debates on the proper distribution of functions in the Internet and communication networks more generally.

The Internet's end systems include desktop computers(e.g.,desktop personal computers(PCs),Macs,and Linux boxes),servers(e.g.,Web and e-mail servers),and mobile computers(e.g.,portable computers,PDAs, and phones with wireless Internet connections).  With the accelerating rate at which technology is advancing today, gaming consoles (such as PlayStation 2/3 and XBOX360)as well as digital cameras are all being connected to the Internet as end systems.  They allow users to interact directly with the Internet to send and receive data.Other end systems are not accessed directly by users, but do facilitate Internet communications. This includes servers for data such as email and web pages. Users connect with such end systems through their own computers, which contact the server to access and transfer information.The end user always interacts with the end systems.The Internet’s end systems include some computers with which the end user does not interact.

End system are also referred as hosts as they host application programs such as a Web browser program.Hosts or end systems usually are further categorized into two groups which are clients and servers.  For your information,clients tend to be desktop and mobile PCs, PDAs, and so on, whereas servers tend to be more powerful machines that store and distribute Web page, stream video, replay e-mail, and so on.


==Advantages of intelligent at the edge==
Nowadays, to have a better throughput performance, intelligence at the network's edge is needed. There are several advantages to show that the important of intelligence at network’s edge.

Since wireless controller is now becoming the bottleneck for throughput and security enforcement as throughput needs rise. By using the 11n access points, distributed intelligence allows more of the on-site data flow to be routed internally on the edge of the network without sending that data to the wireless controller and back. The ability of the &quot;spokes&quot; to communicate directly with one another along an optimal path is increases, even prioritizing more critical data while providing full security and mobility services.

Furthermore, remote troubleshooting and advanced self-healing are greatly facilitate by the access points that distribute intelligence throughout the network. During outages access points can also serve a bridging function to reduce latencies. Since security is as important to the organization as solid network coverage and availability, it is important to make sure that any distributed architecture has enough application awareness to be self-healing without dropping VoIP calls and that it is able to deliver the same firewall capabilities as hub-and-spoke to avoid compromising QoS. This helps maintain network services throughout outages, ensuring the organization and its assets continue to benefit from continued local QoS prioritization, authentication, security policies and direct routing as well as backhaul failover to 3G.

With distributed traffic management, a single controller can oversee up to eight times the number of access points. This frees up controllers to focus on large scale network and policy management as well as other services, resulting in a more efficient architecture. Access points with built-in sensors for security and troubleshooting can also eliminate extra installation and power costs that would come with a separate sensor network.

Furthermore, access edge switches are tasked with providing intelligence at the edges of your network. The modular design of these switches enables network administrators to first classify traffic, and then decide what action to take with that classified traffic. Traffic can be classified based on criteria such as: source/destination port, source/destination MAC address, Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) ID, protocol, IP source/destination address, IP source/destination network, Type of Service (ToS)/Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP), TCP/UDP source/destination port, or TCP flags.

Classifiers can also be associated with a QoS policy to allow per-port or per-flow traffic shaping. This lets classified traffic be shaped in 64 kbps increments based on individual users or applications. This is especially popular in university housing scenarios, where traffic shaping on a per-port basis allows differentiated service and/or better control of bandwidth requirements at the edge of the network.

Moreover, greater intelligence at the edge of the network can also make IT budgets go further, offering advantages in both capital and operational expenditures. Adding 802.11n access points to the network can be less expensive than adding more controllers, and can actually result in significant savings since access points with greater intelligence can reduce the number of controllers needed.

In short, the advantages of having intelligence at network edge is obviously important and greatly providing better throughput to user and clients without compromising security or quality of service and driving up cost.




==Shared Access==

Access network referred to the physical links that connect an end system to the first router (edge router). Local telco referred to the local wired telephone infrastructure provided by a local telephone provider such as Telekom Malaysia and Digi Service Center in Malaysia. Central Office (CO) is a building where the telco switch located and each residence or customer will link to its nearest telco switch. 

'''Dial-up'''

Dial-up Internet access is set up when the PC is attached to a dial-up modem, which is in turn attached to the home’s analog phone line. Users dial an ISP’s phone number and make a traditional phone connection with the Internet Service Provider (ISP) modem. Dial-up internet access has two major drawbacks. It is very slow with a maximum rate of 56kbps. User can only choose either surf the Web or receive and make an ordinary phone call over the phone line at the same instant time. 

'''DSL'''

Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) internet access is obtained from the wired local phone access (i.e., the local telco). A telephone call and an Internet connection can share the DSL link at the same time because the single DSL link is separated into 3 channels (high-speed downstream, medium-speed upstream, ordinary two-way telephone). DSL has two major advantages over dial-up internet access. It can transmit and receive data at much higher rates. Besides that, users can simultaneously talk on the phone and access the Internet.

'''Cable'''

Cable Internet access makes use the cable television company’s existing cable television infrastructure. It is known as hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) access network because both fiber and coaxial cable are used in this system. Cable internet access is a shared broadcast medium. Therefore the transmission rate will be lower when there are several users download a video file simultaneously. 

'''FTTH/FTTP'''

Some local telcos provide high-speed Internet access over optical fibers which are known as Fiber-To-The-Home (FTTH)or Fiber-To-The-Premise (FTTP). Direct fiber is the simplest optical distribution network for one optical fiber link from the CO to each home so that user receives high bandwidth. Actually, each fiber leaving the central office is shared by many homes and it is split into individual customer-specific fibers when the fiber gets relatively close to the homes. 

'''Ethernet'''

Ethernet is a local area network (LAN) used to connect an end system to the edge router in corporate and university campuses. 

'''Wide-area wireless access'''

Wide-area wireless access networks enable users to roam internet on the beach, on a bus, or in your car. For such wide-area access, a base station is used over the cellular phone infrastructure within a few tens of kilometers. 

'''WiFi'''

WiFi is a wireless LAN access based on IEEE 802.11 technology which installed at everywhere such as universities, business office, cafés, airports, homes and even in airplanes. Wireless users must be within a few tens of meters of an access point that in turn is connected to the wired Internet. 

'''WiMAX'''

WiMAX, also known as IEEE 802.16, operates independently of the cellular network and provides speeds of 5 to 10 Mbps or higher over distances of tens of kilometers.




==Last mile evolution and problems==
The 'last mile' refers to the final connection, reaching the user, which enables the user to actually connect their computer to the Internet. In the year 1989, the first commercial dial-up ISP, “The World” started their business in United States; at the time, the only means of internet access for the general public was dial-up, by telephone line. In the early 2000s, this was followed by ADSL internet connections, which allowed the users to surf the internet at a higher speed. FTTH is the latest internet connection service provided by local ISP to their network. What are the differences between dial-up connection, ADSL connection, FTTH and others type of internet connection currently available?

'''Wired connections'''

'''Dial-up'''

From the word “Dialup”, users know they need to dial a number to make an internet connection to the outside world. Modern dial-up modems normally transfer at 56Kbps unless the ISP use compression techniques to exceed 56Kbps speed limit. During the dial-up process, we can hear an &quot;handshake&quot; noise.The noise takes place to established connection and information exchange with the local remote server. Several problems occur in dial-up connection; phone line during dial-up connection for voice service would be disturbed; only a computer can connect to the internet by using dial-up connection per phone line; it has low speed internet connection compared to the new ADSL connection.


'''ADSL'''

Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) is a type of Digital Subscriber Line technology (DSL). The term “Asymmetric” in ADSL connection means the upload band and download band is unequal bandwidth. Normally ISP will allocate more bandwidth for the download band rather than the upload band because the clients usually browse web pages, download files, read email etc, which require the server to send data to their clients. ADSL or DSL has a connection speed ranging from 256Kbps to 20Mbps. ADSL also use the same infrastructure as dial-up connection. The unused bandwidth in the twin-pair copper wire phone line can be used simultaneously for transmission of data (internet) and voice or fax services at the same line. There are few problems associated with ADSL connection. Firstly, not every phone line is equipped for ADSL service and it maybe not be available for some rural areas. Secondly, it requires static IP address to send or receive data. This is the main problem that causes the run out of IPv4 address and the static IPs have high internet security risk. Finally, the ADSL has been replaced by optical fiber connection to counter the limitation of the ADSL bandwidth.


'''FTTH'''

Fiber to the Home (FTTH)has become popular in the city area in which it provide high speed internet access, IPTV and phone call services. Some ISP companies in Hong Kong, US and South Korea provide 1Gbps Internet connection to their network. FTTH connections are using optical fiber to replace the usual metal local loop used for the last mile telecommunications. FTTH lets their users experience same upload and download bandwidths. This means the FTTH internet connection is good for certain network applications especially P2P type file sharing. Until now, optical fiber connection still is the fastest internet connection between point-to-points. Unless scientists discover a new technology that can defeat the speed of the light.


'''Wireless connections'''

'''3G &amp; Wimax 4G'''

3rd generation mobile telecommunication (3G) is a mobile telecommunication services that fulfill the International Mobile Telecommunication-2000 (IMT-2000) standard. 3G and 4G Wimax are the evolution of 2G GSM network. Below are few examples of 2G networks until 4G networks:

'''2G'''- Fully digital 2G networks replaced 1G (analog) in the 1980s.

'''2.5G'''- known as General Packet Radio Service (GPRS),used for data transfer. Data transfer speeds up to 114Kbps

'''2.75G'''- known as Enhanced Data GSM Environment (EDGE), used for data transfer such as pictures sharing or browse internet. Data transfer speeds up to 384Kbps.

'''3G''' – speeds up to 2Mbps for stationary or walking users and 384kbps in moving vehicle. Provide better security than 2G network. Used for mobile TV, Videoconferencing and Video on demand.

'''3.5G''' – known as High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), evolution for mobile telephone data transmission. Speed up to 7.2Mbps.

'''4G''' – known as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (Wimax). Offers speeds of up to 75Mbps, but in reality the speed needs to be split among the users. 

The biggest problem that occurs in the wireless channel is that the bandwidth needs to be shared among the users, leading to competition for bandwidth as a scarce resource. More simultaneous users lead to smaller shares of the bandwidth pie for all, and thus poorer service. Local ISPs usually attempt to contain the problem with fair usage policies; these set (and thereby cap) a quota of data usage for each user. Such measures are unpopular, and some ISPs are trying to provide (and advertise) solutions without such capping.

==Conclusion/Summary of Internet Edge==


Internet edge is considered as an edge of a network. Desktop computers, servers, and mobile computers are included as the Internet’s end systems because they are at the edge of a network. End systems run (host) application programs such as Web browser program, therefore they are also referred to as hosts. Hosts are divided into two categories which are clients and servers. The client-server model of Internet application is a distributed application because client program running on one end system (one computer) and server program running on another end system (another computer). Client components initiate requests for services, which provided by server components to one or many clients.


There are several advantages of intelligence at network’s edge. By using the 11n access points, the ability of on-site data flow is increased and prioritizing more critical data while providing full security and mobility services. Moreover, the access points also greatly facilitate remote troubleshooting and advanced self-healing. During outages, it can also serve a bridging function to reduce latencies. Furthermore, access edge switches are designed to enable network administrators to classify traffic first, and then decide what action to take with that classified traffic. Classified traffic is shaped in 64 kbps increments based on individual users or applications. This traffic shaping on a per-port basis allows differentiated service and/or better control of bandwidth requirements at the edge of the network. Additionally, it is less expensive by adding 802.11n access points to the network than adding more controllers and access points with greater intelligence can reduce the number of controllers needed. In short, intelligence at network edge is greatly providing better throughput to user and clients without compromising security or quality of service and driving up cost.


Access network referred to the physical links that connect an end system to the first router (edge router). Local telco referred to the local wired telephone infrastructure provided by a local telephone provider. Central Office (CO) is a building where the telco switch located and each residence or customer will link to its nearest telco switch. There are some ways to share the access network such as dial-up which is using the phone line to connect network, DSL which obtained from the wired local phone access, cable which is using both fiber and coaxial cable, FTTH which is provided high-speed internet access over optical distribution and Ethernet which is LAN used to connect an end system to the edge router. Besides that, other ways also enable to access the network like WiFi which is a wireless LAN access based on IEEE 802.11 technology, Wide-area wireless access networks which is enable users to roam internet in outdoor and WiMAX which operates independently of the cellular network in higher speed or distances.


In dialup connection, phone line for voice service can be disturbed; only one computer can connect to the internet by using per phone line; the internet connection speed is low compared to ADSL connection. For ADSL connection, not every phone line is equipped for ADSL service, it maybe not available for some rural area and it required static IP address to send or receive data. While users experience same upload and download bandwidths with FTTH. It is the fastest internet connection between point-to-point using optical fiber. Problem for wireless channel is the bandwidth need to be shared among the users. The speed is low when more users use the network at the same time.

      <comment>/* Virtual Private Networks */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Virtual Private Networks ===

A VPN is a secure pathway through a public network that is used to allow private access to an institutions network.  Many businessmen and women use this type of network to communicate with their company network securely using the internet. This communication is usually encrypted for the case that it ends up in the wrong hands. A VPN may be used to share data and give access to databases and printers.

[[File:VPN remote.jpg|thumb|VPN]]

VPN is a point-to-point connection across a private or public network, such as Internet. A VPN client uses tunneling protocols (special TCP/IP-based protocols) to make a virtual call to a virtual port on a VPN server.  Typically, a client initiates a virtual point-to-point connection to a remote access server over the Internet. The remote access server answers the call, authenticates the caller and transfers data between the VPN client and the organization’s private network. VPN protects any communication that is carried out over a public network such as the internet. They can also provide several types of data protection including: confidentiality, integrity, data origin authentication, replay protection, and access control.

Data shared across a VPN is encapsulated or wrapped with a header. The header contains routing information that enables the data to travel through the shared or public network to reach its destination. To emulate a private link, the data is encrypted for confidentiality. Packets that are intercepted on the shared or public network are indecipherable without the encryption keys.

= Coordinates system =

There are several ways to position the (X,Y,Z) axis triplet.
[[File:Rechte-hand-regel.jpg|thumb|The right hand rule]]
* Z-is-up : used in Blender, this means (X,Y) is the ground, and Z is the altitude
* Y-is-up : used in OpenGL, this means (X,Y) is like a wall, so Y is the altitude, and Z is going closer/farther to that wall
* right-handed / left-hand : OpenGL and Blender use a right-handed coordinates system, which means you can represent it using your right hand, with X on the thumb, Y on the index, and Z on the middle finger. A left-handed coordinates system, as used by DirectX, can be represented similarly using the left hand.

Using the Blender Z-is-up coordinates system in OpenGL can be tempting, but introduces issues:
* .obj files are usually in Y-is-up, requiring changes when loading them (or when exporting them from Blender)
* the camera is in Y-is-up, so if you use a Z-is-up coordinates system, by default the camera is at (0,0,0) ''and'' it faces the ''bottom''.  This is quite confusing when rotating the camera, because, for instance, if your camera is looking on the horizon towards the Y axis, and you rotate on the Z axis to look left or right, you'll actually rotate the view on the Y axis (barrel roll).  When transforming the camera, you'd have to imagine that you shoot the video from your feet.
* other engines such as Irrlicht and Ogre also use Y-is-up
Consequently we'll stick with Y-is-up in this book.

= Positioning the camera =

There's no built-in concept of camera in OpenGL.  We have to somewhat cheat to implement it.

Our technique is the following: instead of thinking how to move our camera in a fixed world, we're thinking how to move the entire world around our camera.

For instance, moving the camera for 3 units on the X axis is the same as moving the whole world for -3 units on the X axis.  Same for all other axis and for rotations.

Keep this in mind when working with the camera.  The end-result will feel completely intuitive, but whenever you work with the camera, if you forget that we've been cheating in the first place, you'll get the wrong transformations.

= Camera control =

We'll start with an intuitive implementation:
* left/right rotates on the camera Y axis
* up/down moves forwards/backwards
* page_up/page_down rotates on the camera X axis
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* code here */
&lt;/source&gt;

To go forwards/backwards, we use &lt;code&gt;glm::translate&lt;/code&gt;.  There are two forms:
* &lt;code&gt;glm::translate(transformation_matrix, glm::vec3(dx, dy, dz))&lt;/code&gt;: applying &lt;code&gt;transformation_matrix&lt;/code&gt;, then move in (dx,dy,dz) expressed in the new coordinates system
* &lt;code&gt;glm::translate(glm::mat4(1), glm::vec3(dx, dy, dz)) * transformation_matrix&lt;/code&gt;: applying &lt;code&gt;transformation_matrix&lt;/code&gt;, then move in (dx,dy,dz) expressed in the coordinates system as it was before the translation
* in the case of a camera translation, don't forget that we cheat and move the whole world, not the camera; consequently the above meaning is reversed for the world2camera matrix.

For instance, if your existing &lt;code&gt;transformation_matrix&lt;/code&gt; rotates your camera 90° to the right, and then translate along Z:
* with the first form you will translate the camera's new left (along world's Z axis),
* while with the second form your will translate the camera forwards (along world's X axis).

-----

This implementation has usability issues: when rotating the camera left/right while it's bent, we're not used to rotate our entire body on this bended axis.  Instead, we're used to rotate just our head on the world straight Y axis. So we need to translate the world Y axis to the camera's local coordinates:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
      glm::vec3 y_axis_world = glm::mat3(transforms[MODE_CAMERA]) * glm::vec3(0.0, 1.0, 0.0);
      transforms[MODE_CAMERA] = glm::rotate(glm::mat4(1.0), -delta_rotY, y_axis_world) * transforms[MODE_CAMERA];
&lt;/source&gt;

Last, let's implementing strafing:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* code here */
&lt;/source&gt;

We analyze the object:
* Minimum coordinates in X, Y and Z
* Maximum coordinates in X, Y and Z
* We compute the size necessary for the object: &lt;code&gt;max-min&lt;/code&gt; in X, Y and Z
* We compute the center of the object: &lt;code&gt;(min+max)/2&lt;/code&gt; in X, Y and Z

We compute of cube around the object:
* We prepare a cube of size 1 (1x1x1), centered on the origin
* We scale it by the size of the object
* We center it on the object

To draw the cube:
* We draw the front face using 1 looping line

As seen in [[../Scientific_OpenGL_Tutorial_05|Scientific tutorial 05]], you can improve situations where lines and surfaces are mixing, by using:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* main */
    glEnable(GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_FILL);
    glPolygonOffset(1, 0);
&lt;/source&gt;

Keep &lt;code&gt;GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_FILL&lt;/code&gt; enabled even after you draw the lines, it needs to be enabled when drawing the surfaces as well.

You can also increase the line thickness if need be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
    glLineWidth(2);
&lt;/source&gt;

'''''Risotto''''' is an Italian rice dish, most popular in the north of Italy. Historically, ''risotto'' is the name given to all recipes that use rice as the main component and are served as first dish in a traditional Italian lunch or dinner as usually pasta also is. This recipe is one of the many variations on the risotto base with seafood ingredients.

{{wikipedia|Risotto}}

==Ingredients==

* 400 grams (14 ounces) ''risotto'' [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] (plump, medium grain rice that contains a lot of starch, the types Arborio, Carnaroli or Vialone Nano are traditionally best)
* 1 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 2 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 1 glass of dry white [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]]
* 300 g of [[Cookbook:Squid|squid]] tubes
* 300 g of peeled [[Cookbook:Prawn|king prawns]]
* 200 g of [[Cookbook:Scallop|scallops]]
* [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]
* 25 grams (1 ounce) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] 
* about a liter of fish [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]]/[[Cookbook:Broth|broth]]
* [[Cookbook:Vinegar|balsamic vinegar]]
* [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
* salt and pepper

==Preparation==

# Cut the squids into stripes or rings. In a bowl marinade the squids, the prawns and the scallops with some oil, balsamic vinegar, oregano, salt and pepper. Let it marinade for half hour in the fridge while you are cooking the rice..  
# Bring the fish stock to simmering point without letting the stock boil. The surface of the stock should just be moving a little. 
# Finely chop the onion and the garlic.
# In a large thick pot heat a thin layer of olive oil and let the onion sweat very gently as for a ''[[Cookbook:Soffritto|soffritto]]''.
# Add the rice and cook until it has a transparent look for not more than 2 minutes. Add some salt and pepper and the wine.
# As the wine cooks away you will see the remaining liquid getting thicker as it is absorbing the starch from the rice. When it is more or less gone, add some hot stock. Do not add too much stock all at once. The rice should never be submerged in stock. Keep stirring it and keep adding more stock as it cooks away. This should take about 15 to 20 minutes.
# Taste during the cooking to see if the rice is done. The rice should be soft, but have enough bite to it to feel the individual grains of rice. 
# Five minutes before the end of the cooking time for the risotto add the marinated rings of the squids, the scallops and the prawns. Finely chop the parsley and add before tuning off the heat.
# When it's done, stir in the butter in small chunks at the time, taste to get the amount of butter right. Season with more salt and pepper to taste. 
# Let it rest for a few minutes, and then serve.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article is for slightly more advanced ASM programmers than the rest of this website.

By default, the SNES is limited to 16kB of sprite patterns, which is the same as:
512 8x8 sprites
128 16x16 sprites
32 32x32 sprites
8 64x64 sprites

As you can see, animated sprites can eat away the available memory pretty quickly.  This is where DMA comes in.  The only problem is DMA isn't all that fast.  You only have time to DMA up to 6kB during v-blank, and even less if you take into account scrolling and OAM updating.  For the purpose of this article, let's stick to 4kB.

How do we prevent DMAing over 4kB, regardless of what we throw at the screen?  We need to make the system know when to stop, and continue the DMA loading into the next frame.  How?  My solution is to divide the v-ram into 1kB slots.  I chose 1kB, because 1kB happens to be a row of 8 16x16 sprites.

All you have to do is jump to the &quot;update_vram_slot&quot; subroutine during vblank, and use the &quot;change_vram&quot; macro whenever you need to update an animation slot.

For example if you want update slot $0400 in vram from address $98a300 use this macro:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
%change_vram(#$98a3,#$04)
&lt;/source&gt;

This code isn't limited to just sprite animation, it also can be used for background animation and scrolling.

      <text xml:space="preserve">
'''Barter''' is a type of [[w:trade|trade]] that doesn't use any [[w:medium of exchange|medium of exchange]], in which goods or [[w:service|service]]s are exchanged for other goods and/or services. It can be bilateral or multilateral as [[w:trade|trade]]. 

Barter and money have different means of balancing an economic exchange. Barter is used in societies where no monetary system exists. When there is one, it is also used, especially in economies suffering from a very unstable [[w:currency|currency]] (as when [[w:hyperinflation|hyperinflation]] hits).

== Transaction issues ==
Barter is possible when [[w:coincidence of wants|coincidence of wants]] of economic actors enables an exchange cycle between their bids. Before any transaction can be undertaken, each party must be able to supply something another party desires.  

– Some communities develop a system of intermediaries who can store, trade, and warehouse commodities, but who may suffer economic risk. 

– Others develop a system with a virtual value unit (&quot;barter dollars,&quot; for example) to measure and balance exchanges, very similar to a monetary system.

– Multilateral barter is more complex to settle but allows trades that would not be possible with bilateral barter. This complexity can be reduced by ''openbarter'' software.

– On the west coast of the United States the [http://www.geocities.com/theskillspool/index.html Beyond Barter] organization extends the concept to a system based on free sharing of services. Although there's no attempt to balance contributions in individual transactions, controls ensure that members are not overburdened.

== History of barter ==

To organize production and to distribute goods and services among their populations, many pre-[[w:capitalist|capitalist]] or pre-market economies relied on [[w:tradition|tradition]], top-down [[w:command|command]], or community [[w:democracy|democracy]] instead of market exchange organised using barter. Relations of [[w:reciprocity|reciprocity]] and/or [[w:redistribution|redistribution]] substituted for market exchange. Trade and barter were primarily reserved for trade between communities or countries. It is also used when the [[w:monetary system|monetary system]] failed to measure the economic value of goods.

Barter becomes more and more difficult as people become dispossessed of the means of production of widely-needed goods. For example, if money were to be severely devalued in the United States, most people would have little of value to trade for food (since the farmer can only use so many cars, etc.)

It is used on important transactions between firms or countries to exchange economic values, when monetary constraints are too expensive for the economic actors. 

A well-known example of multilateral trade is the [[w:triangular trade|triangular trade]]. 

Money used to be considered as simpler for small trades; but use of the Web has changed that perception, especially in respect to Swapping.

== In finance ==
In [[finance]], the word &quot;barter&quot; is used when [[w:corporation|corporation]]s trade with each other using non-money or &quot;near-money&quot; financial assets, such as U.S. [[w:Treasury bill|Treasury bill]]s.

== Swapping ==
Swapping is the increasingly prevalent informal bartering system in which participants in [[w:Internet communities|Internet communities]] trade items of comparable value on a trust basis.

While swapping is an excellent way to find and obtain items that are inexpensive, it relies upon honesty. A dishonest participant might arrange a swap, and then never complete their end of the transaction, thus getting something for nothing. This practice is called ''swaplifting'', a [[w:pun|pun]] on ''[[w:shoplifting|shoplifting]]''. The victim's recourse is often limited to [[w:shunning|shunning]] the swaplifter, or taking him to [[w:small claims court|small claims court]].

== Misuses of the word &quot;barter&quot; ==
As of 2007, it is popular (especially on UK daytime television) to use the word &quot;barter&quot; in place of &quot;haggle&quot;. ''To Buy Or Not To Buy'' uses the word in one of their catchphrases: &quot;Will you barter or scarper?&quot; It is commonly understood that the guests on the show will be paying solely with money and not, for example, offering them part exchange on their A reg Ford Cortina.</text>

==Introduction==

Zune (Aros MUI replacement) has a few features of MUI3.8 but many things have still to be done, compatibility checked and bug(s) fixed. 

Test all that native mui apps on os4/mos, and it will be the best test case for zune-mui3.8 compatibility. Like for example by Ibrowse, WookieChat, SabreMsn, Amirc and Lunapaint to trap inconsistencies. 



===MUI3.8===

Tabs don't work, the string acknowledge notification doesn't work, and the gui wants to resize by itself for no reason i.e. when entering text into the chat window, etc.. and refreshes itself continually for no reason? Or so it seems? .. 

Zune still doesn't support custom application screens. All the needed parts (PSI and muiscreen library) are already in place, now it's only a matter of connecting them. 

cause crashes - most notable are objects embedded in balance groups. 

NList classes don't appear to get minmax'ed so items get drawn at the original &quot;size&quot; still 
Some Zune classes call MUIA_ShowMe inside show method (maybe they shouldn't) which triggers a recalcdisplay method in window class. Which first hides objects. Does re-asking minmax, relayout, and show objects again. Here's one of the problem. show show &quot;recursion&quot;, etc, etc.

Trouble with boopsi gadget based classes (like prop) which then create boopsi gadget twice, ...

[http://sourceforge.net/projects/htmlview-mcc/ HTMLview MCC] is made portable and should be ported to AROS. 



===MUI4===

MUI4 was really extended or improved in many ways, but for applications like OWB, mainly dtpic.mui with alpha support, groups/tabs able to use groups as titles, list class much improved and adding proper methods for display/construction/destruction/whatever instead of hooks. There were also many improvements in family handling and much more.

===Issues===

There are some annoying stuff with MUI. Get() for instance, some values will not get() e.g. BOOL, WORD or strings unless you get the Exact correct data types right. Took days to work out why the values I set in GUI never matched up in what I saved.

Also, why are some useful macros in MUI are now obsolete?
Slider(x,y,z) is easy to use than MUI_MakeObject() or SliderObject() ... So I stuck with the obsolete stuff.
How do I stop the Zune SliderObject from displaying the current level as a number inside the slider? Setting MUIA_Slider_Quiet to TRUE when creating it doesn't seem to have any effect.
I've worked around this problem for now by subclassing MUIC_Prop and creating a Slider-like API on top of it.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Attorney-Client&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
Control the granularity of access to the implementation details of a class
=== Motivation ===
A &lt;code&gt;friend&lt;/code&gt; declaration in C++ gives complete access to the internals of a class. Friend declarations are, therefore, frowned upon because they break carefully crafted encapsulations. Friendship feature of C++ does not provide any way to selectively grant access to a subset of private members of a class. Friendship in C++ is an all-or-nothing proposition. For instance, the following class &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt; declares class &lt;code&gt;Bar&lt;/code&gt; its friend. Class &lt;code&gt;Bar&lt;/code&gt; therefore has access to '''all''' the private members  of class &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt;. This may not be desirable because it increases coupling. Class &lt;code&gt;Bar&lt;/code&gt; cannot be distributed without class &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt;. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class Foo 
{
private:
  void A(int a);
  void B(float b);
  void C(double c);
  friend class Bar;
};

class Bar {
// This class needs access to Foo::A and Foo::B only.
// C++ friendship rules, however, give access to all the private members of Foo.
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Providing selective access to a subset of members is desirable because the remaining (private) members can change interface if needed. It helps reduce coupling between classes. Attorney-Client idiom allows a class to precisely control the amount of access they give to their friends.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
Attorney-client idiom works by adding a level of indirection. A ''client'' class that wants to control access to its internal details, appoints an ''attorney'' and makes it a friend --- a C++ friend! The &lt;code&gt;Attorney&lt;/code&gt; class is crafted carefully to serve as a proxy to the &lt;code&gt;Client&lt;/code&gt;. Unlike a typical proxy class, &lt;code&gt;Attorney&lt;/code&gt; class replicates only a subset of &lt;code&gt;Client&lt;/code&gt;’s private interface. For instance, consider class &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt; wants to control access to its implementation details. For better clarity we rename it as &lt;code&gt;Client&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;Client&lt;/code&gt; wants its &lt;code&gt;Attorney&lt;/code&gt; to provide access to &lt;code&gt;Client::A&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Client::B&lt;/code&gt; only.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class Client 
{
private:
  void A(int a);
  void B(float b);
  void C(double c);
  friend class Attorney;
};

class Attorney {
private:
  static void callA(Client &amp; c, int a) {
    c.A(a);
  } 
  static void callB(Client &amp; c, float b) {
    c.B(b);
  }
  friend class Bar;
};

class Bar {
// Bar now has access to only Client::A and Client::B through the Attorney.
};
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;Attorney&lt;/code&gt; class restricts access to a cohesive set of functions. The &lt;code&gt;Attorney&lt;/code&gt; class has all inline static member functions, each taking a reference to an instance of the &lt;code&gt;Client&lt;/code&gt; and forwarding the function calls to it. Some things are idiomatic about the &lt;code&gt;Attorney&lt;/code&gt; class. Its implementation is entirely private, which prevents other unexpected classes gaining access to the internal of &lt;code&gt;Client&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;Attorney&lt;/code&gt; class determines which other classes, member functions, or free functions get access to it. It declares them as &lt;code&gt;friend&lt;code&gt; to allow access to its implementation and eventually the &lt;code&gt;Client&lt;/code&gt;. Without the &lt;code&gt;Attorney&lt;/code&gt; class, &lt;code&gt;Client&lt;/code&gt; class would have declared the same set of friends giving them unrestrained access to the internals of &lt;code&gt;Client&lt;/code&gt;. 

It is possible to have multiple attorney classes providing cohesive access to different set of implantation details of the client. For instance, class &lt;code&gt;AttorneyC&lt;code&gt; may provide access to &lt;code&gt;Client::C&lt;/code&gt; member function only. An interesting case emerges where an attorney class serves as a mediator for several different classes and provides cohesive access to their implementation details. Such a design is conceivable in case of inheritance hierarchies because friendship in C++ is not inheritable, but private virtual function overrides in derived classes can be called if base's private virtual functions are accessible. In the following example, the Attorney-Client idiom is applied to class &lt;code&gt;Base&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function. The &lt;code&gt;Derived::Func&lt;/code&gt; function gets called via polymorphism. To access the implementation details of &lt;code&gt;Derived&lt;/code&gt; class, however, the same idiom may be applied.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;

class Base {
private:
  virtual void Func(int x) = 0;
  friend class Attorney;
public:
  virtual ~Base() {}
};

class Derived : public Base {
private:
  virtual void Func(int x)  {
    printf(&quot;Derived::Func\n&quot;); // This is called even though main is not a friend of Derived.
  }

public:
  ~Derived() {}
};

class Attorney {
private:
  static void callFunc(Base &amp; b, int x) {
    return b.Func(x);
  }
  friend int main (void);
};

int main(void) {
  Derived d;
  Attorney::callFunc(d, 10);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt; is on the leftt side it is easier for machine 


'''Space of words''' &lt;math&gt;X ^ \omega&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of all infinite strings over the alphabet.

&lt;math&gt;X ^ \omega = \left \{ 0,1 \right \} ^ \omega &lt;/math&gt;


The strings (&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000, etc.) would all be in this space.  

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; represents the empty string

==Action==
[[Image:Least significant bit.svg|thumb|280px|right|The binary representation of decimal 149, with the lsb highlighted. The msb in an 8-bit binary number represents a value of 128 decimal. The lsb represents a value of 1.]]
Here is only one '''transformation ( action )'''  a  ona a input word c :

&lt;math&gt;c = c_0w&lt;/math&gt; 

where :
* &lt;math&gt;c_0\,&lt;/math&gt; is a lsb&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Least significant bit|wikipedia : Least significant bit]]&lt;/ref&gt; , first symbol ( here at the beginnig, but for binary notationit will be at the end of sequence)
* &lt;math&gt; w \,&lt;/math&gt; is a rest of the word c


Transformation is defined by 2 recursion formulae : 
* if the first symbol &lt;math&gt; c_0\,&lt;/math&gt; is zero then we change it to one and the rest of the word remains unchanged
* if it is one :
** we change it to zero 
** carry 1 to next column.&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Binary_numeral_system|Wikipedis : carry at Binary_numeral_system]]&lt;/ref&gt;
** aply action to the next column (symbol) until last column 

Formally:
:&lt;math&gt;
(c)^a = 
\begin{cases}

 ( 0w )^a = 1w \\
( 1w )^a = 0w^a 
\end{cases}

&lt;/math&gt;

or in other notation :

:&lt;math&gt; a( 0w ) = 1w \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; a( 1w ) = 0a(w) \,&lt;/math&gt;

&quot;This transformation is known as the adding machine, or odometer, since it describes the process of adding one to a binary integer.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.tamu.edu/~nekrash/Preprints/img.pdf ITERATED MONODROMY GROUPS by VOLODYMYR NEKRASHEVYCH]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(c)^a = c + 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;


More explicitly :&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.uconn.edu/~teplyaev/research/NT.pdf%20 Groups and analysis on fractals Volodymyr Nekrashevych and Alexander Teplyaev]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; a(x_1 x_2 . . . x_n ) = y_1 y_2 . . . y_n \,&lt;/math&gt;

if and only if

&lt;math&gt; ( x_1 + 2*x_2 + 4*x_3 + ...  + x_n*2^{n-1} ) + 1 = y_1 + y_2*2 + y_3*4 +... + y_n*2^{n-1} (mod 2^n )&lt;/math&gt;

Both '''input and output''' are binary numbers least-significant bit first. 



===Examples===

Word c is a sequence of n symbols ( from 0 to n-1) representing binary integer : 
:&lt;math&gt;c = c_{n-1} ..c_1c_0 = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i 2^i &lt;/math&gt;


where &lt;math&gt;c_n&lt;/math&gt; is an element of binary alphabet X ={0,1}

without carry because lsb &lt;math&gt; c_0 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;: 
   0 
 + 1 
 ---
   1

Here lsb &lt;math&gt; c_0 = 1 &lt;/math&gt; then c_0+1&gt;1 so one has to carry 1 to next column

   1 
 + 1  
 ---
  10

==Diagram==
[[File:Moore diagram of Binary Adding Machine.svg|500px|Moore diagram of Binary Adding Machine]]


Here '''alphabet''' &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;  is a set consisting of two symbols so it is called binary alphabet:

&lt;math&gt; X =  	\left \{ 0,1 \right \} &lt;/math&gt;

'''Labels''' shows pairs of symbols : input/output

There are 2 '''vertices''' ( nodes, states of machine) : 1 and 0.

Vertices correspond to the states . 

&quot;The states of this machine will represent the value that is &quot;carried&quot; to the next bit position. 

Initially 1 is &quot;carried&quot;. 

The carry is &quot;propagated&quot; as long as the input bits are 1. 

When an input bit of 0 is encountered, the carry is &quot;absorbed&quot; and 1 is output. 

After that point, the input is just replicated.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~keller/ Robert M. Keller :  Finite-State Machines]&lt;/ref&gt;

 BinaryAddingGroup	( global variable )
This function constructs the state-closed group generated by the adding machine on [1,2]. This group is isomorphic to the Integers.
 BinaryAddingMachine	( global variable )

This function constructs the adding machine on the alphabet [1,2].
This machine has a trivial state 1, and a non-trivial state 2. It implements the operation &quot;add 1 with carry&quot; on sequences.

 BinaryAddingElement	( global variable )
This function constructs the Mealy element on the adding machine, with initial state 2.

These functions are respectively the same as AddingGroup(2), AddingMachine(2) and AddingElement(2).

In some rare cases, the rotated object disappears.
I suspect a float precision issue causing the Matrix to get NaN values, similar to the one that made me clamp angle:
 float angle = acos(min(1.0f, glm::dot(va, vb)));

If you find it, please fix :)

== Which data to apply in the Pythagore Theorem in order to compute z ? And is the ball centered around origin assumption has been made ? ==

It is said in this article to apply Pythagore theorem in order to compute z value :

&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle b \;=\; \sqrt{c^2 \,-\, a^2}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

I easily understand that c stands for z value, but what values must be applied to c and a in the Pythagore formula ?

I would also need to know if the assumption that the ball is centered around OpenGL origin has been made.

Thanks in advance

: Hi,
: In the formula, a is the click position along X in the Projection, b is the z coordinate, and c is the ball's radius.
: The ball is &quot;pressed&quot; on the screen, and its radius is 1, so its center is located at (0,0,-1) is View space (not sure what you call OpenGL origin).
: Does that make more sense? :) [[User:Beuc|Beuc]] ([[User talk:Beuc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beuc|contribs]]) 13:21, 9 October 2011 (UTC)

::Hi
::Thank you, now I've well understood for the formula.
::In fact, for the ball origin, it is possible to have the Ball centered at the origin if you set the camera location away from the origin (with GLU gluLookAt()), that's why I asked you that question.
::Thank you very much

''removed comment about ctrl+right because using ctrl+right breaks the use of uniforms in shaders (appears to be a bug in blender))''
: I don't have this issue - and ctrl+right is only about the display layout, not about features. That sounds quite strange. Did you report it to Blender?

:: Could you test the last code example on [[GLSL_Programming/Blender/Shading_in_View_Space]]? I have a student who wasn't able to make it work on Linux when using ctrl+right, i.e. the object stays black whatever uniform value is set. I tested it on Windows and it showed the same problem (if I use ctrl+right). The diplay layout should have no effect on features; thus, I'm rather sure that it is a bug. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to report the bug yet. If you can reproduce it, please go ahead and report it. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 14:35, 9 October 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I found the definition of the image function hard to follow. Would it be correct to write the second half of it as follows? (in symbols of course): &quot;for S which is a subset of A, the function returns g(x) &lt;u&gt;which is a subset of B&lt;/u&gt;, such that every x is a member of S&quot; (addition underlined). This would make clear that g(x) refers to a set of values returned by g(-), not to the function g(-) itself. Of course we already said that the image function maps from subsets of A to subsets of B, but this small redundancy would help those of us who are not math pros. (Don't know if you've ruled out illustrations, but the picture in the Wikipedia article on Image (mathematics) immediately made clear what is meant.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Address Of&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
Find address of an object of a class that has an overloaded unary ampersand (&amp;) operator.

=== Also Known As ===

=== Motivation ===
C++ allows overloading of unary ampersand (&amp;) operator for class types. The return type of such an operator need not be the actual address of the object. Intentions of such a class are highly debatable but the language allows it nevertheless. Address-of idiom is way to find the real address of an object irrespective of the overloaded unary ampersand operator and its access protection. 

In the example below, &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function fails to compile because &lt;code&gt;operator &amp;&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;nonaddressable&lt;/code&gt; class is private. Even if it were accessible, a conversion from its return type &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; to a pointer would not have been possible or meaningful.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class nonaddressable 
{
public:
    typedef double useless_type;
private:
    useless_type operator&amp;() const;
};

int main()
{
  nonaddressable na;
  nonaddressable * naptr = &amp;na; // Compiler error here.
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
The Address-of idiom retrieves the address of an object using a series of casts.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template &lt;class T&gt;
T * addressof(T &amp; v)
{
  return reinterpret_cast&lt;T *&gt;(&amp; const_cast&lt;char&amp;&gt;(reinterpret_cast&lt;const volatile char &amp;&gt;(v)));
}
int main()
{
  nonaddressable na;
  nonaddressable * naptr = addressof(na); // No more compiler error.
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Known Uses ===
* [http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_47_0/libs/utility/utility.htm#addressof Boost addressof utility]
This function is already in the &lt;memory&gt; header of the new C++ standard C++11.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I was raised in Kinston, NC, where this recipe is &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; considered real Eastern NC pork bbq sauce. King's Restaurant in Kinston and Wilber's Restaurant in Goldsboro, NC, offer what many consider the very best pork bbq anywhere. Both have sauces that are true Eastern NC sauces. Scott's BBQ Sauce, made in Goldsboro, is another excellent sauce. None of these sauces have any sugar, honey, molasses, or anything else as a sweetener. Each is a variation on the cider vinegar, salt, pepper, and spices theme. King's and Wilber's use a little water in their sauces, Scott's does not. 

It is also incorrect (ridiculous, even) to state that a whole hog must be cooked for it to be considered Eastern NC bbq. You can bbq pork without planning to feed 100 people. A butt, ham, or shoulder will feed smaller numbers, and can be just as tasty as cooking the whole hog. Cook it slowly over indirect heat with plenty of hardwood smoke, basting often with the sauce and occasionally with some bacon grease or drippings from the meat.

=== Intent ===
* Optimize return-by-value 
* Allow Return Value Optimization (RVO) on compilers that cannot handle Named Return Value Optimization (NRVO)

=== Also Known As ===

=== Motivation ===

Returning large C++ objects by value is expensive in C++. When a locally created object is returned by-value from a function, a temporary object is created on the stack. The temporaries are often very short-lived because they are either assigned to other objects or passed to other functions. Temporary objects generally go out-of-scope and hence destroyed after the statement that created them is executed completely. 

Over the years compilers have evolved to apply several optimizations to avoid creation of temporaries because it is often wasteful and hampers performance. Return Value Optimization (RVO) and Named Return Value Optimization (NRVO) are two popular compiler techniques that try to optimize away the temporaries (a.k.a. copy elision). A brief explanation of RVO is in order.

'''Return Value Optimization'''

The following example demonstrates a scenario where the implementation may eliminate one or both of the copies being made, even if the copy constructor has a visible side effect (printing text). The first copy that may be eliminated is the one where &lt;code&gt;Data(c)&lt;/code&gt; is copied into the function &lt;code&gt;func&lt;/code&gt;'s return value. The second copy that may be eliminated is the copy of the temporary object returned by &lt;code&gt;func&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;d1&lt;/code&gt;. More on RVO is available on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_value_optimization Wikipedia]

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
struct Data {
  Data(char c = 0) 
  { 
    std::fill(bytes, bytes + 16, c); 
  }
  Data(const Data &amp; d) 
  { 
    std::copy(d.bytes, d.bytes+16, this-&gt;bytes);
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;A copy was made.\n&quot;; 
  }
private:
  char bytes[16];
};

Data func(char c) {
  return Data(c);
}

int main(void) {
   Data d1 = func(‘A’);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Following pseudo-code shows how both the copies of &lt;code&gt;Data&lt;/code&gt; can be eliminated. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
void func(Data * target, char c) 
{  
  new (target) Data (c);  // placement-new syntax (no dynamic allocation here)
  return;                 // Note void return type.
}
int main (void)
{
   char bytes[sizeof(Data)];                   // uninitialized stack-space to hold a Data object
   func(reinterpret_cast&lt;Data *&gt;(bytes), 'A'); // Both the copies of Data elided
   reinterpret_cast&lt;Data *&gt;(bytes)-&gt;~Data();   // destructor
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Named Return Value Optimization (NRVO) is a more advanced cousin of RVO and not all compilers support it.  Note that function &lt;code&gt;func&lt;/code&gt; above did not name the local object it created. Often functions are more complicated than that. They create local objects, manipulate its state, and return the updated object. Eliminating the local object in such cases requires NRVO. Consider the following somewhat contrived example to emphasize the ''computational'' part of this idiom.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class File {
private: 
  std::string str_;
public:
  File() {}
  void path(const std::string &amp; path) { 
    str_ = path;  
  }
  void name(const std::string &amp; name)  {
    str_ += &quot;/&quot;;
    str_ += name;
  }
  void ext(const std::string &amp; ext) {
    str_ += &quot;.&quot;;
    str_ += ext;
  }
};

File getfile(void) {
  File f;
  f.path(&quot;/lib&quot;);
  f.name(&quot;libc&quot;);
  f.ext(&quot;so&quot;);
  f.ext(&quot;6&quot;);

  // RVO is not applicable here because object has a name = f
  // NRVO is possible but its support is not universal.
  return f; 
}

int main (void) {
  File  f = getfile(); 
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In the above example, function &lt;code&gt;getfile&lt;/code&gt; does a lot of ''computation'' on object &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; before returning it. The 
implementation cannot use RVO because the object has a name (&quot;f&quot;). NRVO is possible but its support is not universal. Computational constructor idiom is a way to achieve return value optimization even in such cases.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===

To exploit RVO, the idea behind computational constructor idiom is to put the computation in a constructor so that the compiler is more likely to perform the optimization. A new four parameter constructor has been added just to enable RVO, which is a ''computational constructor'' for class &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;getfile&lt;/code&gt; function is now much more simple than before and the compiler will likely apply RVO here.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class File 
{
private: 
  std::string str_;
public:
  File() {}
  
  // The following constructor is a computational constructor
  File(const std::string &amp; path, 
       const std::string &amp; name,
       const std::string &amp; ext1,
       const std::string &amp; ext2) 
    : str_(path + &quot;/&quot; + name + &quot;.&quot; + ext1 + &quot;.&quot; + ext2) { }

  void path(const std::string &amp; path);
  void name(const std::string &amp; name);
  void ext(const std::string &amp; ext);
};

File getfile(void) {
  return File(&quot;/lib&quot;, &quot;libc&quot;, &quot;so&quot;, &quot;6&quot;); // RVO is now applicable 
}

int main (void) {
  File  f = getfile(); 
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Consequences ===

A common criticism against the computational constructor idiom is that it leads to ''unnatural'' constructors, which is partly true for the class &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt; shown above. If the idiom is applied judiciously, it can limit the proliferation of ''computational'' constructors in a class and yet provide better run-time performance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Circular Motion==,br&gt;
[[File:Circular motion vectors.svg|thumbnail|right|&amp;theta; = angular displacement&lt;br&gt;r = radius/position vector&lt;br&gt;P = position of the object along the path&lt;br&gt;v = linear velocity&lt;br&gt;&amp;Omega; = angular velocity along axis of rotation&lt;br&gt;a = centripetal acceleration]]

Circular Motion is a motion of an object along a circular path. If the speed of the body remains constant throughout the motion, the object is said to perform a uniform circular motion. 
For an object in uniform circular motion along a circular path of radius R and &lt;math&gt;\vec{r}&lt;/math&gt; be the position vector of the object with the center of the path as the and &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}&lt;/math&gt; being the unit vector along it and T be the time taken to traverse the path once (period), the total linear distance covered in one period is (the circumference of the circle)
: &lt;math&gt;s = 2 \pi R&lt;/math&gt;

The speed (or linear velocity) is then given by
: &lt;math&gt;v = \frac{s}{T} =  \frac{2 \pi R}{T} = 2 \pi fR\qquad\qquad\ldots\left(f=\frac{1}{T}\,=\textrm{frequency}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The linear velocity is a vector quantity whose direction at any given instance is tangential to the circle at that point.
The angular velocity around the circle is
: &lt;math&gt;\vec{\omega} = \frac{\vec{r}\times\vec{v}}{\left|\vec{r}\right|^2}&lt;/math&gt;
Due to the vector product, the angular velocity vector is perpendicular to the plane of motion.

With circle of radius R = 1
: &lt;math&gt;\omega = 2 \pi f &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==ElectroMagnet Introduction==
It's been observed that Current carrying conductor does exhibit a Magnet's characteristic

==ElectroMagnet==
The magnetic field of Earth and the planets is explained as ElectroMagnet by my own theory. The magnetic field of the Earth and the planets is generated by electric currents. But, all published theories to explain the magnetic field of a planet are wrong. There is no known theory able to explain the obvious connection with the rotation, including why the direction of rotation and field approximately match. The rotation of the planet is obviously the cause of the magnetic field. Popular theory not even explain the polarity of the field. Despite the lack of evidence, outlandish theories about the magnetic pole reversals are common. In fact, the polarity is clear from the rotation and can therefore cannot change. The correct explanation is actually surprisingly easy. The cause is simply the electric current generated directly by the rotation of the planets, and the charge separation of free ions by gravity. Positively charged ions  are usually heavier than negative charged ions and are therefore shifted to the rotation axis. We first consider only the negative charges, the electrons, of the Earth, neglecting the positive charges of the atomic nuclei. In 24 hours the total charge of the electrons crosses once through a cross section of the Earth. The mass of the Earth is at first approximation two times the mass of the protons, since there are about as many neutrons almost as heavy. Then the current caused by the rotation of the electrons around the axis of the Earth within 24 hours is easy to calculate. &lt;math&gt;
\left( 
\frac{ mass \, of \, Earth} {2 \times mass \, of \, proton} 
\right) \times \left( \frac{charge \, of \, electron}{24 h } \right)
= -3.3 \times {10} ^ {27} \, A
&lt;/math&gt; Since the Earth is electrically neutral overall, a current of exactly equal magnitude is produced by positive charges. The magnetic fields  generated by both currents cancel each other almost completely. But, since the positively charged ions, however, are slightly shifted by gravity towards Earth's axis, the remaining effect of the negative charges causes Earth's magnetic field.

It's been observed that 

# Any Coil conductor when conducts current does attract metal just like the Lodestone Magnet . Hencr the name [[ElectroMagnet]] . Current carrying conductor does exhibit the characteristic of a magnet
# When place a metal material in the turns of current conducting Coil of several turns the material become a magnet . Unlike ElectroMagnet, when the current is turn off or when the material is taken out of the coil's turns the material still retain its magnetic hence the name [[Permanent Magnet]]
: [[File:Electromagnetism.svg|200px]]

==ElectroMagnet Characteristics==
* Magnetic field
: The [[Magnetic field]] is made up of Magnetic field lines that travels from North Pole to South Pole that is from Positive terminal to the Negative terminal . When current is zero, ElectroMagnet does not attract metal or Magnetic field does not exist when there is no current flow . The Magetic Field Strength is the product of The Coil's Inductance and Current . 
: B = L I

* Magnetic Poles
: A magnet has two &quot;Poles&quot; namely [[North Pole]] and [[South Pole]] correspond to the Current Polarities .  North Pole correspond to Plus polarity . South Pole correspond to Minus polarity

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Permanent Electromagnetic Magnet==
A permanent magnet is an electromagnetic that does not lose its magnetic field when the current is zero

===Permanent Electromagnet Properties===
# A magnet has two &quot;poles&quot; namely north pole and south pole.  
# The magnetic field is made up of magnetic field lines that travels from north pole to south pole
# The magnetic field Strength is the product of the coil's inductance and current. B = L I
# Magnet of same poles repel; different poles attract

      <text xml:space="preserve">==ElectroMagnet/Coil of several Turns==
When a coil of several turns is connected with Electric source, Magnetic Field exist and has the same form as Magnetic Field of Natural Magnet. Current conducting Coil of several turns generates Electromagnetic Field of expanding Elliptical lines. 
: [[File:VFPt cylindrical coil real.svg|200px]]

==ElectroMagnet's Characteristics==
===Magnetic Poles===
The polarities of the electric source form a Magnetic Poles . The Positive Terminal correspond to North Pole and Negative Terminal correspond to South Pole . 
===Magnetic Field===
Magnetic Field is made up from Expanding Magnetic Field Lines running from North Pole to South Pole . The Magnetic Field Strength is directly proportional to Current in the coil and the inductance of the coil and can be calculated by mathematical formula
: B = L I

Where
: I is Current measured in Ampere
: L is Inductance measured in Henri

===Magnetic Field Force===
The Magnetic Field Force is directly proportional to Magnetic Filed Strenght and the length of the Magnetic Field Line and can be calculated by mathematical formula
: F = B l

===Magnetic Voltage Induction ===
Magnetic Voltage Induction on a Coil
: &lt;math&gt;B = L I&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dB}{dt} = L \frac{dI}{dt} +  I \frac{dL}{dt} = L \frac{dI}{dt} + 0 &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dB}{dt} = L \frac{dI}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

''Change of Magnetic Field strenght is proportional to Inductance of the coil and change in Current flow through the coil''


Magnetic Voltage Induction on a Coil's Turn
: &lt;math&gt;\phi = N B&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\phi}{dt} = N \frac{dB}{dt} +  B \frac{dN}{dt} = N \frac{d\phi}{dt} + 0 &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\phi}{dt} = N \frac{d\phi}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;
''Change of Magnetic Flux strenght is proportional to Inductance of the turns and change in Magnetic Flux through the coil''

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It computes arc tangent. It returns the principal value of the arc tangent of x, expressed in radians.
In trigonometrics, arc tangent is the inverse operation of tangent.
Note that because of sign ambiguity, function cannot determine in which quadrant the angle falls only by its tangent value. To determine quadrant, we can use [[Wikipedia:atan2|atan2]].
Return value of this function is principal arc tangent of x, in the interval [-pi/2,+pi/2] radians.


==Syntax==
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;
double atan ( double x );
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, x is Floating point value.


==Example==

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#define PI 3.14159265

int main(void)
{
  double param, result;
  param = 1.0;
  result = atan(param) * 180 / PI;
  printf(&quot;The arc tangent of %lf is %lf degrees\n&quot;, param, result );
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Output==
The arc tangent of 1.000000 is 45.000000 degrees.

== diffusion of innovation ==

Might not exactly belong in this section, but certainly something about diffusion of innovation belongs somewhere in this book. One place to consider starting: [[Communication_Theory/Diffusion_of_Innovations]]. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TDang|contribs]]) 17:12, 12 October 2011 (UTC)

== TDang review April 2012 ==

I'm reviewing [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Non-IP_approaches_to_innovation&amp;diff=2313864&amp;oldid=2313861 this version]. I'll likely be more critical than complimentary, because (a) that's the way I am and (b) that's what will help improve things. Please don't take the criticism-over-compliments to mean I have a wholly negative view.

Make sure to check the [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#review_thoughts_April_2012|all-purpose review thoughts]] as well.

* The ''theme'' of the introduction is good, but it needs to be thought out more carefully:
*# ''&quot;guarantee profits&quot;''--clearly it doesn't guarantee profits, for instance if the IP is terrible or there's a better substitute.
*# ''&quot;comes at a cost, and which may de-incentivize innovation given the additional costs&quot;''--this isn't clear. Maybe it can't be clear until ideas are more developed later, in which case it should be removed. Or maybe it just needs to be clarified?
* ''Open Source''
** Overall, this section needs to be thought about (maybe researched) more carefully.
** ''public source''--this doesn't mean anything that I'm aware of, perhaps you mean &quot;public domain&quot;?
** ''&quot;Open source owners still have the right to exclude someone to access or edit it.&quot;''--in many cases, that's not true, and it's certainly misleading. I think it's best to pull it out or explain better.
** Worth mentioning Copyleft-type licenses here, and maybe another major success like Linux or Apache.
* ''Academic''
** ''&quot;Nash Equilibrium Theorem is finished in Nash’s graduate report.&quot;'' This needs to be phrased differently, maybe &quot;As an example of an academic producing ...&quot;
** ''Wolfram Alpha''--I believe that's a for-profit and IP-protected project.
** Many/most academic papers are copyrighted currently. However, the profitability of the paper is usually not the primary concern of the author.
** This section very much needs references.
** This could be connected to a new movement for &quot;open access academic journals&quot; (http://www.boston.com/yourtown/cambridge/articles/2012/04/28/harvard_pushes_back_against_academic_publishers_pricing_encourages_open_access/)
* ''Artistic''
** Again, this section very much needs references.
** The internet was initially developed by the U.S. government, not artists.
** You'll need some reference talking about how manga artists do it not-for-the-meny (or use a different example with a reference)
** deviantart is a good example.
* ''Prize Incentives''--This is a good start. One thing to be careful of is that it may be mixing up things where there are '''both prizes and IP''', such as the Indie games competition, where there are prizes, but the creators still own the IP to their work. It's OK to have both of those things active at once, but it needs to be clear what's a &quot;pure&quot; non-IP example and what's mixed.
* ''Patronage''--Go [http://interviews.slashdot.org/story/04/10/20/1518217/neal-stephenson-responds-with-wit-and-humor read this], mainly the part starting at &quot;2) The lack of respect..&quot;. Normally, I wouldn't suggest using Slashdot as a reference, but in this case, it's referencing Neal Stephenson (a successful author) writing about the current way of publishing, and talking about Patronage.
** Otherwise, again, it needs references.
* ''Kickstarter / Provision point''
** ''&quot;this approach is a modern day version of patronage&quot;''--it works very differently from traditional patronage, though, where the creation of the work is supposed to glorify the patron as well as the creator. It's hard to argue that in a project crowdfunded by 15,000 people he work glorifies all 15,000.
** ''&quot;For instance, if more projects are introduced then there will be more variety for funders to choose from.&quot;''--You might be onto something, but it's not obvious.
** The point of provision point mechanisms is to counter the voluntary contribution / public goods problem. Describing this doesn't make sense without talking about it in those terms, and providing references.
* ''Diffusion of innovations''--This looks like a good start for something, but not this page. Can you move it to its own page?
* ''References''--The references currently there look good, but I've noted a lot of places above where references are needed.
* ''Public goods''--The nature of encouraging innovation is getting past the public goods problem. Intellectual property is one way to get past that problem. All the alternatives need to be considered in light of the same problem.
*# One possibility is something like a provision point mechanism which explicitly recognizes the public goods problem, but handles it a different way.
*# Other possibilities consider the public goods problem in different ways.
*# Patronage implies that a patron may get non-financial utility (prestige) out of funding creative works.
*# Creators may have non-financial motivations to create (art for the love of it, impressing people of romantic interest).
*# There may be financial motivations which aren't captured by IP. Open-source software is often developed by for-profit businesses just to help them run their business, or because they provide a complement to the software.
*# Academic, open-source, and many artistic communities are often described as having a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy#Information_gift_economies gift economy].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this chapter, we use Newton's Laws to see that accelerations actually come from forces applied to an object.  In the chapters on one and two dimensional motion, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; was simple a &quot;given&quot; quantity.  It simply existed in the equations of motion and you were allowed to give it any value.  In this chapter, we will see that accelerations come from '''forces'''.   Forces are pushes or pulls on objects that you witness everyday (push a door to open it, pull on your book to lift it, push a cell phone button to click it).  With the exception of gravity, forces are always &quot;contact forces&quot; meaning a force must actually touch an object to exert its influence on it. Forces also require an agent, meaning that you should always be able to identify what (the agent) is producing the force. Forces are also vectors, meaning their strength (push or pull) can be in any direction. The SI unit of force is aptly named the Newton, and is symbolized by &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;''N''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;.

== Newton's Laws ==
You probably know that Newton's Law says &lt;math&gt;F=ma&lt;/math&gt;, but this is not always the most useful equation to try and use in a physics course.  &lt;math&gt;a=\frac{F}{m}&lt;/math&gt; is better, but still isn't quite right. It is more correct to say that &lt;math&gt;a=\frac{\Sigma F}{m}&lt;/math&gt;, which still isn't fully correct.  The best version is  &lt;math&gt;{\vec a}=\frac{\Sigma {\vec F}}{m}&lt;/math&gt;, stressing the vector property of forces. Be sure you fully understand what this last version means and how to use it. &lt;math&gt;{\vec a}&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the object's mass and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma{\vec F}&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of all forces acting on the object.

== Types of forces == 

We will only be concerned (in this chapter) with three forces: weight, tension, and normal.

=== Weight ===

Weight is &lt;math&gt;w=mg&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is an object's mass and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the Earth's acceleration of gravity of &lt;math&gt;9.8&lt;/math&gt; m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The weight &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; of a body is equal to the magnitude &lt;math&gt;F_g&lt;/math&gt; of the gravitational force on the body. Do not confuse mass and weight; they are not the same thing and be sure you know the difference between them. Mass is also known as object's inertia, or resistance to want to change its current state of motion. A person who has mass 80 kg, has mass 80 kg on Earth, and on Jupiter. However, the person's '''weight''' on Jupiter is substantially greater due to the magnitude of the gravitational force on Jupiter.

=== Tension ===

If a cord is attached to an object, and then the cord is drawn taut, the force experienced by the object is called tension. The tension vector has the same direction as motion vector, meaning that tension is only experienced when an object is pulled, never when it is pushed.

=== Normal Force === 

Normal is the force an object feels when it is sitting on a surface, is always perpendicular to the surface, and is not always equal to &lt;math&gt;mg&lt;/math&gt;.

== The key point ==

The crux of this entire chapter is &lt;math&gt;\Sigma {\vec F}&lt;/math&gt;, because it requires three hard steps. The first, which most students have great difficulty with, is to identify all forces acting on an object. The second is to correctly draw these forces, each pointing in the proper direction, as they act on the object (even more difficult for most students). The third is to realize that &lt;math&gt;\Sigma{\vec F}&lt;/math&gt; which is only usable when you break it up into component form, or &lt;math&gt;\Sigma F_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma F_y&lt;/math&gt;.  Your working equations for this week are then &lt;math&gt;a_x=\Sigma F_x/m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_y=\Sigma F_y/m&lt;/math&gt;.

== Connections with kinematics (an object's observed motion) ==

The connection points with the chapters on one and two dimensional motion are that these accelerations, which come from forces, are the same ''a'''s that go into the equations of motion for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;x=x_0+v_0\Delta t+\Sigma F_x\Delta t^2/(2m)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_x=v_{0x}+\Sigma F_x\Delta t/m&lt;/math&gt;. Be sure these make sense to you and do not casually read over the &lt;math&gt;\Sigma F_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma F_y&lt;/math&gt;. Know what they mean: Using Newton's law is a way of finding the acceleration on an object, and this really means that all forces acting on an object need to be broken up into their &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; components, properly signed (+ or -), then added together along a given axis to then find a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and a&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the previous chapter, three forces were discussed: weight, tension and normal force. In this chapter we will discuss in detail friction, drag, and centripetal acceleration. All of these forces are commonly observed in motion, and there are several real world examples of them. For instance, a race car must be engineered so that it encounters minimal friction with the track, as well as minimal air drag as it races. However, the tires of the car must be designed so that some friction is encountered. If the tires were frictionless, the car would not be able to slow down when making a high-speed turn, and would end up crashing.

==Types of Forces==
In this chapter, we will focus on three other forces: friction, drag, and circular motion.

=== Friction ===

Friction is a force that always opposes all motion; it always acts in a direction exactly opposite to that in which an object is moving (or trying to move), and typically comes when the object rubs or drags against another object as it moves.  It is defined as &lt;math&gt;{\vec f}=\mu{\vec N}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of friction, and &lt;math&gt;{\vec N}&lt;/math&gt; is the normal force acting on the object. There are two types of friction, static and kinetic, also known as sliding friction. Static friction is the amount of initial force required to move an object, and kinetic friction is the amount of force required to sustain motion in an object. Because of this, static friction is always greater than or equal to kinetic friction.

=== Drag ===

Drag is like friction in that it always acts in a direction opposite to that in which an object is moving, but comes from fluids such as air and water, through which an object might be moving. This relationship is documented in the equation &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;D-F_g={\vec F}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;, because the vectors representing drag and motion are in opposite directions. Since drag occurs in the presence of fluids, air resistance is a form of drag. Drag is related by the equation &lt;math&gt;D=\frac{1}{2}CpAv^2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the drag coefficient, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the effective surface area that encounters the resistance, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the fluid density, and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the object's speed.

=== Circular Motion===

Imagine a person whirling a yo-yo around in circles. The yo-yo has a string of length 10 cm, and a constant speed. While the speed is constant, the velocity however, is not. This is because velocity has a direction, and in circular motion, the direction is always changing. An easy way to understand this is to think of a circle with several points on it. Using the points, draw tangent lines on the circle. These tangent lines represent the different velocities, all of which have varying directions, even though their speed may be the same. Remember that speed is the magnitude, or absolute value of velocity. A general equation gives the ''centripetal acceleration'' in terms of the velocity and the radius: &lt;math&gt;a = \frac{v^2}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Ground Mode ==
Ground mode is when the player is standing or walking on the ground.  In ground mode, the following routine is performed:

1) Check to see if jumping button is pressed

2) If so, jump to &quot;initiate_jump_mode&quot; routine

3) Check collision with the tiles below

4) If all tiles underneath player are empty, jump to &quot;initiate_fall_mode&quot; routine

=== Initiate Jump Mode ===
1) set &quot;y_velocity&quot; to &quot;take_off_velocity&quot;

2) set &quot;jump_mode&quot; flag

=== Initiate Fall Mode ===
1) set &quot;y_velocity&quot; to #0

2) set &quot;jump_mode&quot; flag

== Jump/Fall Mode ==
Jump/Fall mode is when the player jumps or falls.  In jump/fall mode, the following routine is performed:

1) increment &quot;y_velocity&quot; by #gravital_acceleration

2) add &quot;y_velocity&quot; to &quot;y_coordinate&quot;

3) if &quot;y_velocity&quot;&gt;0, then go to &quot;fall_mode&quot; routine

=== Fall Mode ===
1) checks for collision between player and tiles

2) If collision is detected, follow &quot;land_on_ground&quot; routine

==== Land on Ground ====
1) reset &quot;jump_mode&quot; flag

2) pop the sprite up to the top of the ground tile

This kebab is prepared by marinating the meat overnight, and grilling it on open fire. It is usually served with Polo(white rice) or Naan (bread).

==Ingredients==
* Olive oil
* 3 [[Cookbook:Onion|Onions]]
* [[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic]]
* Half teaspoon saffron
* Salt
* Black pepper
* 1kg [[Cookbook:Lamb|Lamb]]

==Procedure==
The marinade is prepared by the mixture of half cup size olive oil, three onions, garlic, half teaspoon saffron, salt and black pepper. One kilogram of lamb is cut into 1 cm thick and 4–5 cm long pieces. It should be marinated overnight in refrigerator, and the container should be covered. The next day, the lamb is thread on long, thin metal skewers. It is brushed with marinade and is barbecued for 5–10 minutes on each side

This kebab calls for ground lamb or beef, adding black pepper, sumac, turmeric, very finely minced onion, and not too much salt. It should actually change the color of the meat, slightly yellow from the turmeric. Let it marinate in the fridge, covered, for at least four hours or overnight.

It is to be grilled like a burger. Served on Polo (White Rice) or Naan(Bread), accompanied by grilled tomatoes and onions cooked on the grill next to the kebab. Sumac is usually served as a tableside garnishing spice</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C Programming/Navigation|Mixing languages|Code library}}

Since the C Programming-Language was not created with Object Oriented Programming in mind, it has no support for classes, inheritance, polymorphism and other OO Concepts. Neither does it have its own Virtual Table, which is found in object-oriented languages such [[C++ Programming|C++]], [[Java Programming|Java]] and [[C_Sharp_Programming|C#]]. Therefore, it is nearly impossible to use an object-oriented programming paradigm with only C's language features and standard library. Since C was never intended to be an OOP Language, lack of Object-Orientation cannot be called a weakness or a flaw in the programming language itself, but it does sometimes limit the use and functionality of the language.
In most cases, however, object-orientation and most OO Concepts can be achieved using third-party libraries. There are many third-party libraries designed to add support for object-oriented programming in C. The most general-purpose and widely used among these is the GObject System, which is part of Glib. The GObject System comes with its own virtual table. To create an object in C using the GObject system, it has to be sub-classed from the GObject struct. 

==Object-Creation==
In this example a new object will be implemented directly derived from GObject. For simplicity, the object is named ''MyObject''.

===Declaring An Object===

To create a simple &lt;u&gt;object&lt;/u&gt;, two structs must be declared. The ''instance'' and the ''class''. They are usually declared in this manner:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

/* in myobject.h */
typedef struct _MyObject MyObject;
typedef struct _MyObjectClass MyObjectClass;

struct _MyObject
{
  GObject parent_instance;

  /* instance members */
};

struct _MyObjectClass
{
  GObjectClass parent_class;

  /* class members */
};

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Boiler-Plate Code===

Since the GObject System is just a third-party library and therefore cannot make any changes to the C Language itself, creating a new object 
requires a lot of boiler-plate code. 

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

/* in myobject.h */
#define MY_TYPE_OBJECT                   (my_object_get_type ())
#define MY_OBJECT(obj)                   (G_TYPE_CHECK_INSTANCE_CAST ((obj), MY_TYPE_OBJECT, MyObject))
#define MY_IS_OBJECT(obj)                (G_TYPE_CHECK_INSTANCE_TYPE ((obj), MY_TYPE_OBJECT))
#define MY_OBJECT_CLASS(_class)          (G_TYPE_CHECK_CLASS_CAST ((_class), MY_TYPE_OBJECT, MyObjectClass))
#define MY_IS_OBJECT_CLASS(_class)       (G_TYPE_CHECK_CLASS_TYPE ((_class), MY_TYPE_OBJECT))
#define MY_OBJECT_GET_CLASS(obj)         (G_TYPE_INSTANCE_GET_CLASS ((obj), MY_TYPE_OBJECT, MyObjectClass))      

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


===Defining The Object===

Before use, the newly created object must be &lt;u&gt;defined&lt;/u&gt;.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

/* in myobject.c */

G_DEFINE_TYPE(MyObject, my_object, G_TYPE_OBJECT);

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Static Functions===

There are a few &lt;u&gt;static&lt;/u&gt; functions that may or may not to be defined, depending on your object. For a minimal object these ones are compulsory:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

/* in myobject.c */
static void my_object_class_init(MyObjectClass *_class) 
{
     /* code */
}

static void my_object_init(MyObject* obj)
{
     /* code */
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


===The Constructor===

There is no internal way of &lt;u&gt;allocating memory&lt;/u&gt; for an object in C. Therefore an &lt;u&gt;explicit&lt;/u&gt; constructor must be declared for the new object.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

/* in myobject.c */

GObject* my_object_new(void)
{
     return g_object_new(MY_TYPE_OBJECT , 0);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


===Object-Usage===

Although creating the object using its own pointer-type is perfectly valid, it is recommended to use the pointer-type of the object  at the top of the hierarchy i.e the furthest off base class. The newly created object may now be used like this:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

/* in main.c */

/* Note: GObject is at the top of the hierarchy. */

/* declaration and construction */
GObject* myobj = my_object_new(); 

/* destruction */
g_object_unref(myobj);

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Inheritance==
===Concept===
Inheritance is one of the most widely used and useful OO Concepts. It provides an efficient way to reuse existing code by wrapping it up into an object and then sub-classing it. The new classes are known as derived classes. Many object hieriarchies can be created using inheritance. Inheritance is also one of the most efficient ways of abstracting code.

===Implementation===
In the GObject System, inheritance can be achieved by sub-classing &lt;u&gt;GObject&lt;/u&gt;. Since C provides no keyword or operator for inheritance, a derived object is usually made by declaring the base instance and base class as a ''member'' of the derived instance and derived class respectively. In C code:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

/* derived object instance */
struct DerivedObject
{
     /* the base instance is a member of the derived instance */
     BaseObject parent_instance;
};

/* derived object class */
struct DerivedObjectClass
{
    /* the base class is a member of the derived class */
    BaseObjectClass parent_class;
};
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;</text>

==Introduction==

Essentially the first phase of the bounty is to try and get all the resources that bare &quot;ACPI&quot; exposes usable in AROS (that can be used at least), and the second phase to add proper AML support so that we can fully utilise ACPI. 

First of all,  we  now  have  working acpi.resource. It's currently responsible  for  gathering  ACPI tables from the system and verifying their  consistency.  Verified  data  can  be queried from the resource using  a  simple API. The API is designed to provide a framework which would  assist  in parsing tables by consumers. I know, the API is very raw and incomplete. I am populating it when a need for it arises. 

Second, we now have ACPITool. It's a diagnosis program. It looks like PCITool  and  displays  the  available info. Currently i wrote parsers only  for  MADT  and  FADT  tables.  The tool correctly displays their contents  in  human-readable form, as well as some general information about ACPI itself. 

Third,  on  x86-64  we  already have secondary cores starting up into idle loop.  Processors are managed by kernel.resource, and it already provides  information about their number. processor.resource uses this information  and  provides  it  to user software in abstract form. For example,  if  you  run  ShowConfig,  it will display how many CPUs you have.  However  only  bootstrap  CPU  will have information filled in. There's  currently no way to run code on a secondary core, and this is out of scope of the task. 

Things that won't happen:

1.  Bounty  specs says ACPITool should tell who uses the information. There is no such mechanism and it's against of Amiga-family OS concept to register who uses some component. Anyone can OpenResource(&quot;acpi.resource&quot;) and use it. 

However i have a list of components using acpi.resource:
* kernel.resource uses APIC data to register and run CPUs. Registered by kernel.resource. processor.resource displays  this information. processor.resource is abstracted, it doesn't report IDs. In AROS, it would be enough to identify a CPU by its number. 0 is boot CPU. kernel.resource already has a function to give a number of CPU on which it was executed. 
* exec.library  ShutdownA()  currently  uses  acpi.resource for cold reboot,  existing  functionality  is  enough  for  this.  It  will be refactored soon, but the idea will stay the same. 
* battclock.resource uses century register number from FADT.
* vgah.hidd will be aware of &quot;No VGA&quot; flag in FADT. 
* pciusb.device  will  detect MacMini via ACPI, and will not require &quot;forceusbpower&quot; argument on this machine. The list can be expanded, i just don't know what other hardware is prone to power bug. 
* PS/2  driver  can  be  made  aware  of &quot;No PS/2&quot; flag... However i wouldn't  like to dive into existing code and refactor it first. However promise to refactor the PS/2 driver in a reasonable time. looked at doing it in a similar fashion in the past but decided against it since it was a &quot;hack&quot; and not the way this stuff is meant to be accessed (which requires a proper acpi aml parser). Power off requires AML. Reboot doesn't, reset register definition is part of FADT. It just needs to set up AROS by retrieve the basic hardware settings and resources exposed in the acpi tables, since we don't have access to the information provided from the DSDT etc (due to lack of AML parser). 

2. IRQ routing. It's rather complex task by itself. And i would leave configuring  IRQs  for  some  other  task. It can be ACPI phase II or something else, like &quot;Multi-processing support&quot;. The basic idea is to implement  a  standalone MP analog of exec.library and be able to run tasks  on  secondary  cores. This will not be an SMP, but it will be a step towards. And it could be used in CPU-intensive applications, like video  players, by running some dedicated task on an available core. since the ACPI resource should be setting up the system with information that is available from ACPI without the need for AML. BTW, this also should include configuring AROS to use HPET which is exposed through ACPI tables.
his means that HPET support needs to be  implemented.  Currently  timer.device  can  work  only with legacy timer. 

Doing this will require to distribute interrupts between processors. I think  new  components  should  be  developed  for  this  task. kernel.resource  is  a microkernel, it should not grow fat, and only a minimal  MP  support  should stay there (identification, IPI, probably that's all). 

3. The specification says &quot;Information should be stored in Amiga-like manner&quot;.  IMHO  on  this  level there's no need to do this. There's no need  to  convert tables into something else, because tables are there anyway, and it's very easy to manage them using an appropriate memory. Introducing  additional  structures  on top of these tables would just waste  RAM,  giving  nothing  new, like bootloader.resource which is currently  superseded  by  kernel.resource's KrnGetBootInfo() (except command  line  parsing).  IMHO  providing  some abstracted Amiga-style information  is a job of higher-level components where appropriate. An example  is  processor.resource whose data do not depend on where it is  taken  from.  ACPI  is  ACPI,  it's  nothing  more,  it's architecture-specific by design. 
But, as i said, there is Amiga-alike API for browsing tables. You can find  the  table  you need by ID, and you can enumerate data stored in array  via  hook.  I'll  also  add  one  more function for enumerating multiple  tables  with  the same ID (for some tables it's valid case), and add taglists with options, like &quot;Fetch DSTD with OEM ID foo&quot;, this 
is also going to be useful. 



==Reference==

CPUS in SMP systems should be registered in some manner, and each set to run an idle thread except the BOOT CPU. 
IMHO halting the CPU is not the same as running an idle thread. The  boot  CPU  aiso has idle loop in cpu_Dispatch(). It is basically while  (no_task_to_run) halt;. This also halts the CPU, just processes interrupts. 

Why  have  two  ways  of  representing  the  same information?  Isn't  current API convenient? You can check for current MADT usage in kernel.resource. You don't go through tables yourself, and you don't go through data structures in a table yourself. 

That is the job of the ioapic. Other than setting up the ioapic to handle routing etc, it has very little (if any) reason to be accessed. However,  what  to  actually do with interrupts? I believe by default they  are  sent to all CPUs. Or only to boot CPU. BTW  is  it  relevant  for  now  at all, since only boot CPU actually processes the hardware? 
they  are  sent to all CPUs. Or only to boot CPU. They default to only the boot AP, and can be configured in many ways (including to the least active AP - which is IMHO the most desirable way to have IRQ processing handled). 
* Disable legacy PIC.
* Reconfigure PCI devices to use APIC interrupts.

Resources having to parse all the information themselves is going to be more costly than exposing it in an AmigaOS-like manner. They don't parse all tables. They ask acpi.resource: &quot;Give me this  table,  and locate these structures in it&quot;. You get exactly what you wanted to, nothing more. 

Define idle thread then. A task which idles on the core - and allows us to see exactly how much time the core has been idle, to gauge processor load etc. 

acpi.resource installs  ShutdownA()  replacement  using SetFunction(). The goal is to  prevent  exec.library  from  bloat.  Because  i  already had a EFI version  of  reboot  routine, now i added ACPI.

Something like mpexec.library. It could contain a legacy-free version of SysBase for each CPU. And run task scheduler on them. The core of this should be handled in the current scheduling code, by using a local (per apic) instance of this task, instead of using the execbase version.  I had changed the scheduler todo this in my old code via TLS, and it appeared to work fine on the boot processor - but I hadn't yet gotten to launching the scheduler on the AP's, since I am not entirely sure of how the scheduler should be launched correctly and suspect it needs each core to have a fake vblank interrupt to trigger the &quot;engine&quot;. 

I had also added the aforementioned changes to the scheduler to handle per-task time usage accounting (and interrupt handlers for all the apics vectors, which provide some very interesting details about whats going on from the apics p.o.v. 

That IRQ routing is not trivial, is not reason/justification to ignore it - the bounty requirement explicitly mentions it since the ACPI resource should be setting up the system with information that is available from ACPI without the need for AML. 
Agree about IRQs then...So, let's define what needs to be done 
1. Disable legacy PIC.
2. Reconfigure PCI devices to use APIC interrupts.
Thats sounds about correct - the IRQ handling code needs to use APIC code (which is currently in kernel resource I believe) instead of PIC code (and should default to PIC unless other options are found), when ACPI resource determines we have better than PIC available.  If IOAPICs are found (via the necessary tables) then we need to configure those to route IRQ delivery, which would preferably be to the least active core - but that would need &quot;fixes&quot; to most of the current interrupt handlers so that they lock access to the hardwares resources at the least.


In fact, SysBase-&gt;IdleCount and SysBase-&gt;DispCount  are  working  now, so it's possible to measure usage at least in percents. FYI DispCount and IdleCount are not enough to calculate the CPU usage. You need to measure a time which cpu spends in idle mode and compare it against total time. Look for sam440/efika for more details where it remembers values of time base counter at certain points. yes, for each task it remembers amount of time cpu is busy with it. In same way idle time is remembered.  Each second it compares amount of time spent in idle mode.

 Therefore, CPU usage (in %) is defined as (idle_time * 100) 


How is usage measured on classic amigaos? If I would write such utility for classic, would create a task with lowest possible priority with tc_Switch and tc_Launch set. Would measure how much time CPU spends in it and would compare it against system time.</text>

The most common theory for AD is that the protein [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_beta Amyloid ß] forms 'plaques' over the brain which slows neural transmission within the brain, leading to nerve death.&lt;ref name=&quot;PAL&quot;&gt;Gerrig, R.J. ''et. al.''., (2008). &quot;Psychology and Life Australian Edition&quot;. p237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AlAus&quot; /&gt; While medical treatment has been particularly ineffective for AD, exercise has been proven in many cases to have slowed or prevented AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mice&quot;&gt;Adlard, P.A., Perreau, V.M., Pop, V., Cotman, C.W.

(2010) &quot;Exercise may reduce Alzheimer's disease brain changes&quot;. ''Washington University School of Medicine''. http://www.physorg.com/news205430929.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exercise as Treatment==

[[File:Elderly exercise.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Resistance training can be useful to improve strength]]As the full extent of how and why AD occurs is not known, medical treatment for AD has not been very effective. Despite this, many sources have reported that exercise can delay or prevent the effects of AD. This may be due to the increase in blood flow to the brain, which prevents plaques from forming by removing Amyloid ß.

===Recommendations===

The main purpose of exercise is to maintain balance, strength, proprioception, coordination and reaction time through the following recommendations. Exercise should be light at first to prevent injury.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIA&quot;&gt;Rodgers, A.B., (2009). &quot;Exercise &amp; Physical Activity: Your Everyday Guide from the National Institute on Aging&quot;. ''National Institute on Aging''. http://www.nia.nih.gov/HealthInformation/Publications/ExerciseGuide/default.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exercise should be done for at least 30 minutes per session, at least 4 times per week.
* Exercise should consist of both aerobic training for cardiovascular fitness, and resistance training for muscle strength.
* Resistance exercises with a chair is a convenient way of exercising at home (see the further reading section).
* Walking, swimming and gardening are also convenient and effective methods of exercise.

[[File:Older adult exercise with tin can..jpg|thumb|left|200px|Household items such as tin cans are suitable substitutes for weights]]

===Considerations===

AD may accompany other chronic diseases such as arthritis, hypertension or diabetes. If the individual is suffering from another chronic disease, exercise should be modified to accommodate the limitations associated with that disease. &lt;ref name=&quot;NIA&quot; /&gt;

{{displaytitle|title=Hardware Devices: Input devices}}
&lt;/NOINCLUDE&gt;
Pay special attention to devices with an {{Font color||#ff9933|orange}} background, you need to be able to describe exactly how they work!
{{Dbox|Input Device|Devices that send data or instructions into a computer}}

====[[w:Mouse_(computing)|Mouse]]====
Enables the user to execute commands or issue instructions to the computer by controlling a pointer on the screen.

====[[w:Keyboard_(computing)|Keyboard]]====
[[File:Qwerty.svg|center|400px]]
The keyboard is one of the most popular ways of inputting information into a computer. The basic mechanical keyboard relies on springed keys being pressed down to complete an electrical circuit.  This circuit then transmits a binary signal (commonly using [[w:ASCII|ASCII]]) to the computer to represent the key pressed.
[[Image:Chiclet keyboard medium.png|thumb|600px|center|Stylised cross-section of a [[w:Chiclet_keyboard|Chiclet keyboard]] (there are other technologies out there used to make keyboards).  The bottom right hand button has been pressed, completing the circuit shown in red.]]
There are many different keyboard layouts, with differences between languages and countries. The most popular layout is the [[w:QWERTY|QWERTY]] keyboard. Other layouts include:
* [[w:Keyboard_layout#AZERTY|AZERTY]] - for countries such as France and Belgium
* [[w:Keyboard_layout#QWERTZ|QWERTZ]] - for countries such as Germany and Austria
* [[w:Keyboard_layout#Arabic|Arabic]] - different values to most keys
* [[w:Keyboard_layout#Ukrainian|Ukranian]]
* [[w:Keyboard_layout#Chinese|Chinese]] - laid over a QWERTY keyboard
There are variations QWERTY keyboard with the [[w:Keyboard_layout#United_Kingdom|UK]] and the [[w:Keyboard_layout#United_States|USA]] having very slight differences in layout.  There also variations in English language keyboards such as the [[w:Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard|Dvorak]] layout, which followers claim to be superior to QWERTY.
[[File:QWERTY keyboard.jpg|center|thumb|QWERTY keyboard]]

====[[w:Speech_recognition|Voice recognition]]====
Microphone connected to software that converts human speech into commands or text.
'''Pros'''
{{Plus|Natural interface with a computer allowing for new users to execute commands without having to learn complex command set}}
'''Cons'''
{{Minus|Speech recognition might not recognise the difference between similar words i.e. &quot;their&quot; and &quot;they're&quot; or be able to understand regional accents}}
[[File:Microphone.svg|center|thumb|microphone]]

====&lt;span style=&quot;background: #ff9933;&quot;&gt;[[w:Digital_camera|Digital camera]]&lt;/span&gt;====
[[File:Reflex_camera_numeric.svg|400px|center]]
# Light is focused through the lens onto the image sensor at the back of the camera
# The image sensor is made up of an array of Red, Green and Blue photosensors, called a [[w:bayer_filter|Bayer filter]].  Each sensor will only record values for that particular colour.
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Shades_framed_aa.jpg|This image
Image:Bayer_pattern_on_sensor.svg|went through this
File:Bayer_pattern_on_sensor_profile.svg|like so
&lt;/gallery&gt;
And became these:
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Shades bayer r.png|Red
Image:Shades bayer g.png|Green
Image:Shades bayer b.png|Blue
&lt;/gallery&gt;
3. The different colour arrays are combined to form an image and makes this:&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Shades_framed_bayer.png|Combined image
Image:Shades_framed_dc.jpg|Applying an algorithm to merge cells
Image:Shades_framed_aa.jpg|''Notice it is not quite the same as this Original''
&lt;/gallery&gt;
4. Once the RGB values have been captured, they can then be stored digitally using SD or compact flash cards. Save formats include [[w:JPEG|JPEG]] or [[w:TIFF|TIFF]].

'''Pros'''
{{Plus|You can preview images taken without having to get them developed}}
{{Plus|You can apply filters and images to add special effects}}
'''Cons'''
{{Minus|Some people argue that the quality of photos taken using the traditional film medium is better}}
[[File:Camara2sig.JPG|center|thumb|Camara2sig]]

====&lt;span style=&quot;background: #ff9933;&quot;&gt;[[w:Barcode_reader|Barcode reader]]&lt;/span&gt;====
Used in supermarkets, keeping track of produce etc.  They allow for quick reading of product details so that prices and information can be retrieved and/or stock levels updated.  However the amount of data stored in a barcode is very limited
[[File:Barcode EAN8.svg|thumb|center|barcodes are very common]]
# A laser is directed towards the barcode, scanning across it and the reflected light is captured by the reader
# The intensity of light reflected back is read by a sensor in the bar code reader
#* High intensity = white bar
#* Low intensity = black bar
# The pattern received is translated into a code which gives the identity of the barcode being scanned
# This code is checked against a product database and the product details displayed
[[File:Plessey barcode values.svg|thumb|center|400px|Plessey code is one way to encode barcodes]]
To make sure that the number you have received is correct barcodes employ check digits.  Read on to find out more

'''Pros'''
{{Plus|Cheap to produce as all you need to do is print a black and white image}}
{{Plus|Quick to read, and with multi-direction scanners, can be read from different angles}}

'''Cons'''
{{Minus|Only a limited amount of data can be stored}}
[[File:Barcode-scanner.jpg|center|thumb|barcode reader]]

====[[w:Optical_Mark_Recognition|Optical mark reader]]====
Used in things like multi choice question papers.  The student would be given a selection of answers and then mark the ones they thought correct with a pen or pencil.  When finished, the forms would be fed into a machine that would look for black marks.  The position of these marks correspond to answers and the form could be marked at some speed.
[[File:LegacyStyleOMRFormSm.jpg|center|thumb|multi choice exam paper ready for OMR]]

====[[w:Optical_character_recognition|Optical character reader]]====
Used in scanning printed or written text into a digital format.  Used by Amazon and [[w:Google_Books|Google]] to scan books.
[[image:book scanner.svg|thumb|center|Sketch of a typical manual book scanner]]

====[[w:Magnetic_stripe_card|Magnetic stripe reader]]====
Used to read data from bank cards and access cards.  Data is stored in the magnetic, generally black, strip on the back of these cards
[[Image:CCardBack.svg|thumb|center|225px|An example of the reverse side of a typical credit card:

Green circle #1 labels the [[w:Magnetic stripe#Financial cards|Magnetic stripe]]]]

====[[w:Smart_card|Smart card reader]]====
Used in bank cards, often known as part of 'chip and pin'.  More secure than Magnetic stripes though more expensive to produce.

[[File:Carte_vitale_anonyme.jpg|center|thumb|250px|A smart card. The 3 by 5 mm security chip embedded in the card is clearly visible on the left hand side. The contact pads on the card enables electronic access to the chip.]]


====&lt;span style=&quot;background: #ff9933;&quot;&gt;[[w:Rfid|RFID reader]]&lt;/span&gt;====
Used to read data without physical contact.  Examples include the London [[w:Oyster_card|Oyster Card]] System.  Where the card has a Radio Frequency Identification(RFID) chip.

[[File:CPT Hardware-Input-RFIDcard.svg|center|thumb]]

# The card is then placed above a reader and the magnetic field produced by the reader creates a current in the cards circuitry (no physical contact is required)[[File:CPT_Hardware-Input-RFIDprocess_magnetic_field.svg|center|250px]]
# This current powers a small radio transmitter that transmits a radio wave with the details about the card to the reader [[File:CPT_Hardware-Input-RFIDprocess_transmit_data.svg|center|250px]]
# If the details of the card are legitimate (checked on database) then it lets the person through the gate[[File:CPT_Hardware-Input-RFIDprocess_check_details.svg|center|250px]]
'''Pros'''
{{Plus|Can be read without physical contact (health and safety concerns)}}
{{Plus|Fast way to pay for things}}

'''Cons'''
{{Minus|Thieves could read your card remotely, stealing your details}}
{{Minus|Having multiple RFID cards together, means that they can interfere with each other and none of them can be read}}
[[File:Oyster card partially destroyed.jpg|center|thumb|200px|A damaged card, revealing the microchip in the lower right corner, and the aerial running around the edge of the card.]]

=== Touch sensitive ===
More and more devices are relying on touch technologies.

====&lt;span style=&quot;background: #ff9933;&quot;&gt;[[w:Touchscreen|Touch-sensitive screen]]====
# Each of the four corners of a screen emits a uniform electric field which covers the screen
# When you place your finger on or near the screen it disrupts this field and draws current
# measuring the amount of current pulled from each corner you can triangulate the position of the finger
[[File:TouchScreen_capacitive.svg|center]]

'''Pros'''
{{Plus|Natural, intuitive interface with devices}}
{{Plus|The ability to remap screen functions to suit the task (for example bringing up a keyboard when necessary}}
'''Cons'''
{{Minus|Cold weather can effect the functioning of touch screens}}
{{Minus|Won't work through gloves, as this stops your fingers conducting electricity}}

[[File:Phone-htc-nexus-one.svg|300px|center]]

====[[w:Graphics_tablet|Graphics tablet]]====
Used in the design and architectural industries.  This allows for people to draw on the tablet in a natural way (as they would with a pencil and paper) and for their drawing to appear on the computer.
[[File:Wacom Pen-tablet.jpg|center|thumb|Wacom Pen-tablet]]

{{CPTAnswer|1=
# A light or laser is directed towards the barcode, scanning across it and the reflected light is captured by the reader
# The intensity of light reflected back is read by a sensor in the bar code reader
## High intensity = white bar

# The different colour arrays are combined to form an image
# The image is stored as a TIFF or a JPEG
}}
{{CPTQuestion|Why might it beneficial for professional photographer to use a digital camera instead of a film camera?}}
{{CPTAnswer|
Digital images allow you to edit and manipulate them, adding software filters.  Digital cameras allow you to take pictures and preview the results, discarding those that you don't want.  Film cameras wouldn't show you the image until you had developed it, and such a process is very expensive
}}
{{CPTQuestion|Give two benefits of using RFID cards to pay for produce over using hard cash.  What is a draw back?}}
{{CPTAnswer|
{{Plus|Can be read without physical contact (health and safety concerns)}}
{{Plus|Fast way to pay for things}}

{{Minus|Thieves could read your card remotely, stealing your details, without you even knowing it}}
}}
{{CPTQuestion|Give a benefit of having a touch screen phone over a phone with a hardware keyboard.  Why might some people prefer a hardware keyboard?}}
{{CPTAnswer|A touch screen phone would allow you to have a keyboard on the screen that could be hidden when not needed.  Meaning the screen space can be used for other purposes

Some people might prefer the hardware keyboard as they like to feel the response of keys being pressed and improve their typing (advances are being made in haptic technology to bring this to touch screens)

=== Scanners ===
Several of the scanners featured here record biological (bio) measurements (metrics) about human beings.  Physical data such as finger prints are unique to each person.

====&lt;span style=&quot;background: #ff9933;&quot;&gt;[[w:Flatbed_scanner|Flatbed Scanner]]====
Flat bed scanners are used to convert images and text into a digital format.
[[File:CPT_Hardware-Input-scanner-flatbed.svg|thumb|400px|center|The main components of a flatbed scanner]]
# Place the object you want to scan on the glass pane, face down
# the light moves to the start of the document and illuminates a slice
# The slice is reflected into the CCD where it's image is stored
# the light and mirror move down to the next slice and so on
# once all the slices are completed they are put together into a digital image
[[File:Scaner.jpg|thumb|center|Flatbed Scanner]]

====[[w:Fingerprint_scanner|Fingerprint Scanner]]====
[[Image:Fingerprint picture.svg|thumb|center|A finger print]] The ridges and troughs on a person's finger and toes are unique to that person. Using a scanner a finger print pattern can be recorded and compared to others on a database, allowing a computer to match finger prints from crimes to a suspect, or to allow people into restricted areas.
[[File:Fingerprint scanner in Tel Aviv.jpg|center|thumb|Fingerprint scanner in Tel Aviv]]

====[[w:Retinal scan|Retina Scanner]]====
[[Image:Fundus photograph-normal retina EDA06.JPG|thumb|center|The blood vessels in a normal human retina form a unique pattern for each person]]
Retina scanners are used to record the pattern of blood vessels at the back of someone's eye. As every has a different pattern of vessels, then retina scanners can be used to uniquely identify people and are very difficult to fake.

====[[w:Iris_recognition|Iris Scanner]]====
[[File:Humaniris.jpg|thumb|center|Iris patterns can be different colours and form a unique identifier for each person]]
By taking a picture of the blood vessels and colouring of someone's eye, we can get a unique pattern that can be used to identify individuals.  People might try and circumvent this by using contact lenses
[[Image:USMC_Sergeant_identifies_Baghdaddi_city_council_member_with_iris_scanner.jpg|center|thumb|A U.S. Marine Corps Sergeant uses an iris scanner to positively identify a member of the [[w:Baghdadi, Iraq|Baghdadi]] city council prior to a meeting with local tribal leaders, [[w:sheiks|sheiks]], community leaders and U.S. service members.]]

=== Check digits ===
{{Dbox|[[w:Check_digit|Check Digit]]|an additional digit added to a data string and depending on that string, used for checking that the string has been sent correctly}}  
With input devices we have a lot of data being sent into the computer, with image capture devices we could be talking about billions of ones and zeroes.  How can we make sure that they all get from the input device to the computer safely, without becoming corrupted?  There are many error checking methods out there and you will cover some of them in more detail in Unit 1, however, for the moment we will learn a little about check digits:

An example of using check digits (The exam will not expect you to know this technique) is the final digit of a [[w:Universal_Product_Code|Universal Product Code]] computed as follows:

# Add the digits (up to but not including the check digit) in the odd-numbered positions (first, third, fifth, etc.) together and multiply by three.
# Add the digits (up to but not including the check digit) in the even-numbered positions (second, fourth, sixth, etc.) to the result.
# Take the remainder of the result divided by 10 (modulo operation) and subtract this from 10 to derive the check digit.
{{CPTExample|title=Example: Check Digits}}
For instance, the UPC-A barcode for a box of tissues is &quot;036000241457&quot;. The last digit is the check digit &quot;7&quot;, and if the other numbers are correct then the check digit calculation must produce 7.  
# Add the odd number digits: 0+6+0+2+1+5 = 14
# Multiply the result by 3: 14 * 3 = 42
# Add the even number digits: 3+0+0+4+4 = 11
# Add the two results together: 42 + 11 = 53
# To calculate the check digit, take the remainder of (53 / 10), which is also known as (53 modulo 10), and subtract from 10. Therefore, the check digit value is 7. Correct!
{{Robox/Close}}

{{CPTExercise|title=Exercise: Check digits}}
{{CPTQuestion|Calculate the check digit for the following food item &quot;01010101010&quot;:}}
{{CPTAnswer|1=
# Add the odd number digits: &lt;math&gt;0+0+0+0+0+0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
# Multiply the result by 3: &lt;math&gt;0 * 3 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
# Add the even number digits: &lt;math&gt;1+1+1+1+1 = 5&lt;/math&gt;
# Add the two results together: &lt;math&gt;0 + 5 = 5&lt;/math&gt;
# To calculate the check digit, take the remainder of (5 / 10), which is also known as (5 modulo 10), and subtract from 10 i.e. (10 - 5 modulo 10) = 5. Therefore, the check digit value is 5.
# If the remainder is 0, subtracting from 10 would give 10. In that case, use 0 as the check digit.
}}
{{CPTQuestion|Did the following barcode scan correctly: &quot;01234567890 '''6'''&quot;?}}
{{CPTAnswer|1=
# Add the odd number digits: 0+2+4+6+8+0 = 20
# Multiply the result by 3: 20 * 3 = 60
# Add the even number digits: 1+3+5+7+9 = 25
# Add the two results together: 60 + 25 = 85
# To calculate the check digit, take the remainder of (85 / 10), which is also known as (85 modulo 10), and subtract from 10 i.e. (10 - 85 modulo 10) = 5. Therefore, the check digit value is 5.
# If the remainder is 0, subtracting from 10 would give 10. In that case, use 0 as the check digit.
Therefore the check digit given, 6, shows that the code is incorrect.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer since things work a little different here.
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you have questions, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(This is not an automated message, I'll be watching during a time for any reply you make to it...)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 18:27, 11 October 2011 (UTC)

@Panic2k4
Sorry, I didn't notice the small text. Thanks for the warm welcome. I have one small question. After how long is the PDF Form of a wikibook updated? I have written an article for the book &quot;C Programming&quot; (Object Oriented Programming : Gobject) and it hasn't yet been added to the PDF Version. Maybe there is some quality assurance checking or something. Secondly, what exactly are the disadvantages of using your real name on the wikibooks account?

{{displaytitle|title=Hardware Devices: Output devices}}
&lt;/NOINCLUDE&gt;
Pay special attention to devices with an {{Font color||#ff9933|orange}} background, you need to be able to describe exactly how they work!

{{Dbox|Output Devices|Device that a computer sends data or instructions to}}

=== Visual display units ===

====[[w:Cathode_ray_tube|Cathode-Ray Tube]]====
A cathode ray tube is a [[w:Visual_display_unit|Visual Display Unit]]. You might know them as the old 'fat' televisions and monitors that have mostly been superseded by LCD screens.

'''Pro'''
{{Plus|the image on a CRT can be viewed from a wide range of angles}}
'''Cons'''
{{Minus|Heavy, large and power hungry compared to LCD screens}}
[[Image:CRT color enhanced.png|center|thumb|250px|Cutaway rendering of a color CRT: &lt;br /&gt;'''1.'''&amp;nbsp;Three Electron guns (for red, green, and blue phosphor dots)&lt;br /&gt;'''2.'''&amp;nbsp;Electron beams &lt;br /&gt;'''3.'''&amp;nbsp;Focusing coils &lt;br /&gt;'''4.'''&amp;nbsp;Deflection coils &lt;br /&gt;'''5.'''&amp;nbsp;Anode connection &lt;br /&gt;'''6.'''&amp;nbsp;Mask for separating beams for red, green, and blue part of displayed image &lt;br /&gt;'''7.'''&amp;nbsp;Phosphor layer with red, green, and blue zones &lt;br /&gt;'''8.'''&amp;nbsp;Close-up of the phosphor-coated inner side of the screen]]

====&lt;span style=&quot;background: #ff9933;&quot;&gt;[[w:Flat-screen_computer_monitor|Flat Screen (LCD)]]&lt;/span&gt;====
[[File:LG L194WT-SF LCD monitor.jpg|thumb|center|A 19-inch [[w:LG|LG]] flat-panel [[w:LCD monitor|LCD monitor]].]]
LCDs are Visual Display Units. Most modern Televisions and Monitors are are liquid crystal displays (LCD).  An LCD screen is made up by an array of pixels or picture elements, each pixel contains Red Green and Blue and there is a back light that shines through the pixel, creating an image
[[File:LCD-normal.png|80px|center]]
To change the image displayed on the screen will require different combinations of Red, Green and Blue pixels.  To do this the pixels are sandwiched between two [[w:Polarization_(waves)|polarized]] grills.
[[File:CPT-Outputs-VDU-LCD-open.svg|300px|center]]
These grills are controlled by an electric current and when current is applied, the grids go perpendicular to each other, blocking out all light from a particular colour.
[[File:CPT-Outputs-VDU-LCD-green.svg|300px|center]]
Applying different current patterns to different pixels means that you can choose whether each pixel displays Red, Green or Blue, thus building an image:
[[File:LCD_pixels.jpg|300px|center]]

'''Pros'''
LCD screens have several benefits over traditional CRT screens:
{{Plus|Smaller and lighter than equivalent sized CRT}}
{{Plus|More energy efficient than CRT}}

'''Cons'''
{{Minus|viewing angles of LCD screens can be smaller than an equivalent CRT.  This means the viewers can't see images from the side of the screen}}
{{Minus|[[w:Defective_pixel|Dead pixels]] can plague LCD Monitors, where the grills governing the colour of an individual pixel get stuck and fix that pixel to always displaying a certain colour or no colour at all}}
[[File:Lcd_display_dead_pixel.jpg|thumb|center|150px|an example of a dead pixel]]

====[[w:Plasma_screen|Plasma Screen]]====
Plasma screens are Visual Display Units. They are generally more expensive than LCDs and CRTs, and offer similar performance to an LCD.  They are power hungry and  used mainly for large television sets

{{CPTExercise|title=Exercise: Visual Display Units}}
{{CPTQuestion|Explain how an LCD screen works:}}
{{CPTAnswer|
# An LCD screen is made up by an array of pixels, each pixel contains Red Green and Blue and there is a back light that shines through the pixel, creating an image.

{{Plus|Smaller and lighter than equivalent sized CRT}}
{{Plus|More energy efficient than CRT}}

{{Minus|dead pixels can effect the image}}

=== Sound output ===
Speech output might include [[w:Speech_synthesis|speech synthesis]], [[w:Headphones|headphones]] or [[w:Computer_speaker|speakers]]
[[Image:Logitech-usb-speakers.jpg|thumb|center|300px|A pair of speakers for notebook computers, runs off USB]]
=== [[w:Electronic_paper|Electronic paper]] ===
[[File:Amazon_Kindle_3.JPG|thumb|150px|center|Amazon Kindle using an e-paper display]]
Electronic paper is made up of tiny plastic balls that have different colours on each side (black and white).  Applying an electrical current to the 'paper' flips the balls to make the pattern of a picture and an image is displayed.  The image stays there until you apply another current. This is used in modern e-book readers such as the Amazon Kindle and in other devices such as phones
[[File:Kindle 3 texture (crop).jpg|thumb|center|If you look closely you can see the 'ball's on the Kindle 3]]
[[Image:E-ink.svg|thumb|center|500px|Appearance of pixels]]
'''Pros'''
{{Plus|Images are easy to read in sunlight, unlike most electronic screens}}
{{Plus|You only need to use electricity to change the image, not maintain it, meaning batteries last longer than LCD screens.  In some cases batteries may last weeks, whilst an LCD equivalent would only last a day or two}}

'''Cons'''
{{Minus|The refresh rate of screens is too slow to show moving images}}
{{Minus|Ghosting might occur, where the shadow of old images remains on the screen after you have refreshed}}

=== Printers ===
There are several different types of [[w:Printer_(computing)|Printer]]s, the one's you need to know are below

====&lt;span style=&quot;background: #ff9933;&quot;&gt;[[w:Printer_(computing)#Impact_printers|Impact Printer]]&lt;/span&gt;====
Impact printers rely on a forcible impact to transfer ink to the media, similar to the action of a typewriter. All but the dot matrix printer rely on the use of formed characters, letterforms that represent each of the characters that the printer was capable of printing. Impact printers varieties include, typewriter-derived printers, teletypewriter-derived printers, daisy wheel printers, dot matrix printers and line printers. Dot matrix printers remain in common use in businesses where multi-part forms are printed, such as car rental services, this allows several sheets of paper to be written to with one strike of the printer head, it also allows for carbon paper to be written to through sealed envelopes:
[[File:CPT-Outputs-Printers-Impact-MultiPart.svg|center|400px]]

Dot matrix printers use a print head containing a line of pins.  The number of pins can vary from 7 into the dozens.  As the print head passes over the paper the pins impact on the ink ribbon forming characters on the paper line by line.
[[File:CPT-Outputs-Printers-ImpactHead.svg|center|75px|7 pin print head]]

[[File:CPT-Outputs-Printers-ImpactExample.svg|center|400px]]

'''Pros'''
{{Plus|Can print multi-part stationary}}
{{Plus|very cheap to run}}

'''Cons'''
{{Minus|unable to produce high definition images, you are limited to the number of pins available}}
{{Minus|slow when compared to laser}}

[[File:Dot_matrix_example_text.png|thumb|center|output from a dot-matrix printer, showing the individual rod strikes on the ribbon to make an image on the paper]]

====&lt;span style=&quot;background: #ff9933;&quot;&gt;[[w:Inkjet_printer|Inkjet Printer]]&lt;/span&gt;====
[[File:Druckkopf.jpg|center|thumb|Inkjet heads: &lt;br&gt; Disposable head (left) and &lt;br&gt; Fixed head (right) with ink cartridge (middle)]]
Inkjets are examples of non-impact printer.  They operate by propelling variably-sized droplets of liquid or molten material (ink) onto almost any sized page. They are the most common type of computer printer used by consumers.
# The paper is fed into the printer
# The print head contains one or more cartridges of ink of different colours (some only have black ink)
# The print head moves from one side to another, each cartridge spraying tiny particles of ink onto the paper to form the correct pattern
# After one line is finished the paper is fed through a little more, and the next line printed

[[File:Inkjet_s.jpg|thumb|center|Output from an inkjet printer showing the individual blobs of ink on the paper]]

'''Pros'''
{{Plus|Inkjet printers are cheaper than lasers}}
{{Plus|They can produce high quality images for photos etc}}

'''Cons'''
{{Minus|They are slower than lasers}}
{{Minus|Per page they are relatively expensive}}

====&lt;span style=&quot;background: #ff9933;&quot;&gt;[[w:Laser_printer|Laser Printer]]&lt;/span&gt;====
Lasers are examples of non-impact printers. A laser printer rapidly produces high quality text and graphics.  They work in the following way:


# The drum is given a negative charge
# This charge is erased in the correct places by the laser to create the image using the [[w:Photoelectric effect|photoelectric effect]]
[[File:Laser printer-Writing.svg|center|400px]]
#&lt;li value=&quot;3&quot;&gt; The drum is coated in [[w:Toner|toner]], a fine dust, which is attracted to the charge on the drum&lt;/li&gt;
# The drum rolls over the paper and transfers the toner onto it(if your printing gets jammed the paper might have this dust on it which comes off on your hands)
# The paper is then put through heated rollers which melts the toner and seals it to the paper, thus finishing the image.
[[File:Laser printer fusing.svg|center|300px]]

'''Pros'''
{{Plus|Fast}}
{{Plus|Cheap to Produce large volumes of printing}}

'''Cons'''
{{Minus|Expensive hardware}}
[[File:Hp_laserjet_4200dtns.jpg|center|thumb|Hp laserjet 4200]]

====[[w:Plotter|Plotter]]====
Plotters were an alternate printing technology once common in engineering and architectural firms. Pen-based plotters rely on contact with the paper, but not impact, per se, and special purpose pens that are mechanically run over the paper to create text and images.  They were particularly adept to printing vector graphics, though they have generally been replaced with wide-format conventional inkjet/laser printers.

# Paper is placed in the plotter.
# The plotter arm selects a pen of the correct colour
# the arm then moves the pen to the area where printing needs to start.
# the pen is lowered onto the paper and the arm moves it drawing a continuous image.
# The pen raises and lowers depending on what needs to be drawn, the plotter can also select from a group of colour pens

(some plotters involve keeping the pens stationary and moving the paper instead)

'''Pros'''
{{Plus|cheap to run}}
{{Plus|can produce very precise technical drawings}}

'''Cons'''
{{Minus|there may be issues around the colour pens available, it is hard to combine colours as you would in an inkjet}}
{{Minus|slow}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv_B_145_Bild-F031434-0012,_Aachen,_Technische_Hochschule,_Rechenzentrum.jpg|center|thumb|Plotter at work on a technical drawing]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">The invention of the automobile in the late 1800s was a breakthrough in the world of transportation.  It allowed people the option to get where they wanted to go quicker than using a horse and carriage.  In its early stages, cars were very expensive and it wasn’t until 1908 when Henry Ford developed a way to make cars using assembly lines that cars were able to be sold much cheaper than they had been previously.  Since this time, automobile technology has gone places Henry Ford probably never saw coming.  While technology has led to cars being built to higher safety standards, motor vehicle fatalities continue to occur as they did in the early days of the automobile.  By looking at the life cycle of the automobile, as well as the amount of motor vehicle related fatalities that have occurred each year since 1899, the periods of birthing, growth, maturity and decline can be found for this mode of transportation.  This provides an understanding of how technological advances and production of automobiles has either helped or hindered the safety of this mode since its creation.
__TOC__
The number of motor vehicle fatalities in the United States based on historical NHTSA and FHWA data was obtained and is shown in Table 1.  This data is plotted along with S-curves used to estimate the periods of birthing, growth, maturity and decline.  In this case, the data was broken up into two sections, the first being the number of fatalities from 1899 to 1962 as this represented the periods of birthing, growth and maturity.  Another phase representing decline was seen between 1963 and 2009.  The plot representing the number of motor vehicle fatalities between 1899 to 1962 can be seen in Figure 1.

[[File:Motor Vehicle Fatalities from 1899 to 1962.jpg|470px|thumb|none|Figure 1: Motor Vehicle Fatalities from 1899 to 1962]]

The data was then used to estimate a three-parameter logistic function of the form:

S(t) = K/[1+exp(-b(t-to)]  , where S(t) is the predicted number of fatalities.

Here, K, is the saturation status level.  Since the data has already entered a phase of decline, K, is simply the highest fatality rate.  This occurred in 1962 when the fatality rate was 39,980.  A K value of 39,900 was used as it gave a better fit of the curve than using a K value of 39,980.  Once a K value was determined, a calculation was done in preparation for performing the regression of the data.  This calculation was used to estimate the dependent variable and was of the form:

Y = LN(Fatalities/(K - Fatalities)), where “Fatalities” is the number of fatalities from the data.

Next, a regression was performed using the “data analysis” tool in Microsoft Excel to help assess the accuracy of the fit of the predicted model to the actual data.  The results of this analysis are shown in Tables 2, 3, and 4.

This analysis gives the intercept of the predicted model.  In this case, the intercept was -284.6.  The analysis also gives an estimate of the coefficient, b, which is used in the equation to predict the number of fatalities.  For the time period of 1899 to 1962, b, was estimated to be .14736.  

An estimate of the inflection time, to, or the year in which ½ K was reached was also needed.  This was found by the following equation:

to = Intercept / -b

In this case, to, was estimated to be 1931.46.

Once all the variables were found to solve for S(t), predicted fatality rates could be determined for each year between 1899 and 1962.  The resulting data is plotted in red in Figure 1.  It forms an S-curve that fits the actual data as accurately as possible.  The accuracy is based on the statistical information presented in Tables 2, 3, and 4.  A K value of 39,900 provided the highest R-squared value of 0.814491.  Typically, the closer an R-squared value is to 1, the more accurate the model represents the data.  In this case, there are most likely outliers in the data that affect the R-squared value.  It can be seen that the actual data itself does not perfectly follow an S-curve shape, so clearly, modeling an S-curve will not perfectly overlap the data.  In this case, an R-squared value of .814491 is probably as good as one would expect given the data.  From Table 4, it can be seen that the t-statistics were higher than 2, which means the results were statistically significant at the 95% confidence interval.  Overall, this model seems to reflect the actual data.

Now that the results are known, the predicted model can be used to estimate the phases of birth, growth and maturity.  From the availability of the data, the birth is shown to be in 1899, which is the first instance of fatality rates being recorded in this analysis.  Since to was found to be 1931, this means that there was a period of growth from 1899 to 1931.  The highest K value was found in 1962, which means that from 1931 to 1962, there was still a period of growth.  However, this growth was slower than before 1931.  This slower growth led to the number of fatalities reaching a point of maturity in 1962.

These periods of increasing and decreasing fatality rates can be attributed to changes in technology as well as in the sales of automobiles.  For instance, as more and more people began purchasing vehicles it would be expected that a higher number of fatalities exist due to the increased amount of vehicle traffic as well as simply having a higher population of motor vehicle owners.  After 1908, when Henry Ford started using the assembly line to mass-produce the cars allowing them to be sold for less money, there was an increased number of people purchasing and traveling by motor vehicle.  This helps explain the phase of growth in motor vehicle fatalities.   
The 1930s began a phase in which safety started to become a focus in car manufacturing.  The use of seatbelts was being advocated in the 1930s along with the use of padded dashboards to assist in safety in the event of a crash.  (Georgano 1992)  Mercedes Benz patented the safety cage in the 1940s.  (Car Safety Features n.d.)  This added safety focus helped make cars safer to drive and probably contributed to the slower rate of fatalities between 1931 and 1962.  However, even though the cars were being made safer, the drastically increasing number of drivers is what kept the number of fatalities large.  From the data, it can be seen that motor vehicle fatalities reached its maturity in 1962. 
  
The phase post-1962 saw an overall decline in the number of motor vehicle fatalities. The plot representing the number of motor vehicle fatalities between 1962 and 2009 can be seen in Figure 2.

[[File:Motor Vehicle Fatalities from 1962 to 2009.jpg|thumb|470px|none|Figure 2: Vehicle Fatalities from 1962 to 2009]]

A similar analysis involving fitting an S-curve to the data and finding a model of best-fit was done again for this phase of the motor vehicle fatality rates.  The results of this analyis are shown in Tables 5, 6, and 7.  In this case, K, was determined from the plot and after testing different values of K, the line of best fit occurred when K equaled 55,000.

This analysis gives the intercept of the predicted model.  In this case, the intercept was 96.008.  The analysis also gives an estimate of the coefficient, b, which is used in the equation to predict the number of fatalities.  For the time period of 1962 to 2009, b, was estimated to be -.047487.  

An estimate of the inflection time, to, or the year in which ½ K was reached was also needed.  This was found by the following equation:

to = Intercept / -b

In this case, to¬, was estimated to be 2021.77.

Once all the variables were found, S(t), or predicted fatality rates could be determined for each year between 1962 and 2009.  The resulting data is plotted in red in Figure 2.  It forms an S-curve that fits the actual data as accurately as possible.  The accuracy is based on the statistical information presented in Tables 5, 6, and 7.  A K value of 55,000 provided the highest R-squared value of 0.48108.  Typically, the closer an R-squared value is to 1, the more accurate the model represents the data.  In this case, there are so many twists and turns in the data, that trying to fit an S-curve just doesn’t match up that well and therefore, the R-squared value is affected.  In this case, an R-squared value of .48108 is probably as good as one would expect given the data.  There are many reasons for the non-linearity or constant declining trend in the actual data including changes to driver safety and changes in motor vehicle technology which created periods of increasing and decreasing fatality numbers within this overall phase of motor vehicle fatality decline.

Throughout the 1960s changes were being made and technology was improving to make cars safer to drive.  One such change was the new standard in the United States that windshields had to have a deformable polymer layer so that in the event of a crash, a person riding in the vehicle would not go sailing through the windshield and be cut by the glass.  The 1980s saw a drastic increase in car manufacturers using airbags even though they were invented in 1952.  (Car Safety Features n.d.)  These added safety features as well as cars being made with lighter weight materials is what contributed to the decline in fatal accidents in the U.S.

Policy changes since 1962 also affected the decline in the number of fatalities.  New York passed the first law requiring seatbelts to be worn in 1984.  This is now a law in every state in the U.S.  Also, in various states, lowering the blood alcohol level and implementing harsher penalties for drunk driving has led to an increase in safety on the roads.  These policy changes and advances in technology help explain the overall declining trend in motor vehicle related fatalities.  While this trend is declining, it is known that accidents will continue to occur until technology advances a lot more, it is unrealistic to assume that the number of fatalities in a given year will ever be zero.

Now that the birth, growth, maturity and declining phases have been identified, it is worth taking a deeper look at this mode of transportation to learn more about the impact it has had on the transportation system and commuters in the United States since its creation in the late 1800s.  The invention of the internal combustion engine in the early 1800s led to the invention of the automobile as it is known to consumers today.  What is referred to as the “Otto cycle” is the four-cycle engine invented by Alphonse Bear de Rochas in 1862.  This process brought gas into the cylinder, compressed it, combusted the compressed mixture and then exhausted it.  Vehicles, which used this technology, ran on petroleum-based fuel, which is what we still use today.  (Bottorff n.d.)  Automobiles are now equipped with more safety features and are built more lighweight then when they were first invented.  A car’s engine runs on a mixture of gasoline and air after getting an initial spark from the car’s battery which gets powered when a driver turns the key and ignites it.  The car moves forward based on the energy it gets as the gas burns and moves the car forward.  The car’s transmission passes all the energy from the engine to the four wheels.  (Brain n.d.) A driver can steer the car in whichever direction they so choose adding to the convenience of this type of mode.

==The Automobile as a New Mode==
The main advantages to automobiles are that they offer passengers the option to commute from point A to point B on their own time.  Unlike taking trains, planes or boats, lightrail systems or other modes, you can hop in a car at essentially anytime and get anywhere fast.  Owning an automobile in todays society allows people to live in more suburban areas and still easily commute to a job in the city or at a distance farther then where they could easily get by walking, biking or taking the bus.  Another advantage to the automobile is it allows people to easily haul items they might not be able to take on a bus or other mode of transportation.  The main market for automobiles in the United States is primarily people over age 15 seeing as this is generally the age you can start driving.  Since automobiles are expensive to purchase and maintain, a more reasonable market for automobiles would be working adults.

==Before the Automobile==
Prior to the advent of the automobile, people were primarily making shorter trips via horse drawn wagons and carriages.  The limitations to the horse drawn carriage was that they could only travel up to 10 miles per day so it was a slow commute.  (Economy 2010)  Other options for transportation were boat, or train systems.  The limitations to these other transportation systems were that they typically only traveled through large cities where they could connect to ports or in the event of the train, they could only travel to areas in which rail tracks had been previously built.  These options didn’t offer that much convenience for taking shorter trips or travelling to smaller towns most likely not connected to train tracks.    

In the beginning, cars were seen as a novelty item that only the rich could afford.  It wasn’t until Henry Ford and his assembly line that cars were made for the masses and could be sold at much lower prices.  (Davis 1976)  Ford also built up his company by paying his employees higher wages so that they could buy a car from the company.  Cars allowed people who had never been beyond their hometowns the option to get out and see the country.  For people who had a car, it wasn’t even about the destination, it was about taking the drive itself as this was scene as something new and exciting that people had never done before. 
 
In the early 1900s, the market for transportation was evolving as people were looking for more independent and faster ways to commute.  People were looking for jobs outside their communities and were curious to explore.  As people saw others driving cars, they quickly learned the ease of access having an automobile provided.  Once cars became more affordable due to the assembly line style of production, more people were financially able to purchase an automobile.  

Having an automobile stirred interest in new possibilities for people.  For the first time, people were able to look for work outside their small towns.  This meant they could have easier access to nearby towns to get supplies their town didn’t have.  People could reach regional hospitals and attend schools in bigger towns so people were becoming more educated.  Since people no longer needed to live close to railroad lines, small towns started to grow and develop. 

==Invention of the Automobile==
As demand increased for automobiles, there was a technological shift in not only how cars were produced to provide more cars to be made each year, but technological advances led to better and more efficient vehicles being made.  Attempts at automobiles using various technologies such as steam powered self propelled engines were being toyed with since the late 1700s to the mid 1800s.  However, the very first car which more closely resembles the vehicles we know today was built in 1885 by Karl Benz who was an engineer from Germany.  His design was a three wheeled machine with a single-cylinder engine.  Not too long after this design was laid out, a four wheeled car was on the market.  It wasn’t until 1891 however, that  an engineer from France came up with the design to have the engine at the front which would drive the rear wheels through a clutch and a gearbox.  (Bridgeman 2002)  Once the main structure of the automobile was laid out, the next question became what type of engine would be used.  

In 1885, Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach from Germany designed an effective carburetor.  (Bridgeman 2002)  This led to the creation of the first true gasoline engine and it is not that far off in design from those that power cars today.  Another advancement in technology came in the early 1900s when the steering wheel was standardized.  The pairing of early ideas for improvements of automobiles from engineers from across Europe was what led to the working model that Henry Ford later used.  However, he added an assembly line building procedure which would expedite the process and allow for the cars to be sold at much cheaper prices because building the cars could be done by people not as highly skilled.  Each person working could focus on one single area or part of the vehicle versus having someone try and build an entire car.    

Shifts in the initial design of the automobile started to take place as inventors, engineers and designers learned from mistakes in the past and looked for ways to make improvements.  Since the faster and  more dependable cars were running on gasoline, the petroleum industry had to be advanced to keep up with the demand.  Ways to produce gasoline and improvements in heat-tolerant oil lubricants were being studied as more and more vehicles on the road meant an increased demand in gasoline.  The 1930s mixed existing technology with the automobile when car radios were installed in vehicles.  Car heaters were also introduced in the 1930s which was a relief for people driving in colder climates.  The number of cars on the road in 1910 was 458,000 as compared to 26,750,000 on the road in 1930.  (Sass 2010)  This meant improvements and advancements in engineering vehicles were being well received by the buying public.   
 
The 1940s and 1950s brought about changes in safety of operating vehicles when turn signals and seatbelts were implemented.  The 1950s also saw the use of gearboxes, disk brakes, electric windows, radial tires, and power steering.  (Cars Auto and Car Information from the People History Site n.d.)  As more technology was being used in cars, car prices increased.  In the 1920s, a new car cost only $290.  In 1947, the average cost of a new car was close to $1,300 and by 1955; the cost had risen to as much as $1,900.  (Sass 2010)  However, more people had jobs and were making more money than they had been in the recession in the 1920s so people were still buying vehicles even though they were costing more money.

Advancements continued, and in the 1970s four wheel drive and airbags were added.  This was also the time a new breed of car manufacteurers from Japan entered the automobile market.  At first, Japanese cars were built really cheap and were of poor quality.  Japanese auto makers quickly learned that the buying public demanded higher standards in automobile production and they soon learned from their mistakes.  Today, makers such as Toyota and Honda are among the world leaders in car sales and are leading the way in current advancements in hybrid technology.  (Cars Auto and Car Information from the People History Site n.d.)  This will continue to be an area of focus for the automobile industry as gasoline and petroleum are becoming a scarce commodity and are getting to be too expensive to be relied upon as the main source of fuel for the future.

After each oil crisis, the cost of petroleum increases and people shift their focus on ways to eliminate the use of petroleum in the industry.  Over the last 20 years, these types of world events have led to cars becoming smaller and improvements in the fuel economy of vehicles have been demanded by the public.  Overall, cars have become more fuel efficient.  One of the main reasons is that engineers have been able to stop the engine from running when the car is stationary and the use of hybrid technology now allows the car batteries to charge while in motion.  The use of hybrid technology is also greatly helping reduce the amount of pollution cars exert into the environment.  All the changes that have happened in the past century with car engineering, including changes to the safety and comfort of operating vehicles has led to the designs we have today.

==Early Market Development==
The initial market niche for the automobile was primarily only the wealthy.  This new mode of transportation at the time was considered to be the replacement for the horse drawn carriage but was not viewed as a primary means of transportation for everyone.   Limited resources meant your average person could not afford an automobile.  It wasn’t until Ford came out with his Model T, that the world saw its first economy car, or one which more people could afford and use as a reasonable mode for travel.

As people realized the speed and efficiency the automobile provided, they understood that they could get around the city faster with the use of the automobile.  The automobile served existing transportation markets better in that it provided speed and convenience by allowing passengers the option to travel at much greater speeds than the horse drawn carriage provided.  Early automobiles that didn’t have windshields meant a lot of dust and debris flying in passengers eyes.  (Davis 1976) This type of problem led to the creation of a pavement industry.  The advancement of automobiles was soon followed by the development of paved roads and road network systems as people quickly realized that driving cars on unpaved roads meant a really bumpy ride.  Traveling on smoother roads was another way existing markets were better served.  

There were many new markets which were also served due to the development of the automobile industry.  People in smaller towns and communities who were using only horse drawn carriages were not afforded the chance to get out and explore connecting communities as it took too long to travel places with that mode.  Having an automobile meant people could get out and see their country more than they ever could before.  They could travel easier and farther than with horses.  People could now vacation and camp because they could pack more items in their vehicles and get to locations farther away from their communities.  The use of the automobile helped create other industries which made use of the automobile and thus assisted in market development.  For instance, fast food industries developed with drive thrus geared towards servicing peole driving automobiles.  In 1909, for the first time ever, an automobile hearse was used in a funeral procession.  Before this time, horse-drawn carriages had always been used to carry the body of a person who had passed away.  Another example was police and highway patrols using automobiles to respond to emergencies quicker than they had been able to previously.  The market developed even more since towns began to grow and jobs opened up far from large cities.  People could then commute to work via the automobile and not have to rely on only finding jobs in the cities.

==Policy in the Birthing Phase==
In order to really develop as a transportation mode that could service the masses, policy changes had to be put in place to aid in the organization of the automobile system.  Some policies were carried over from previous transportation networks, however, because the automobile was so different from previous modes, a lot of policies had to be envisioned.  One policy that was carried over from a former mode was the idea that cars would drive on the right or left side of the road.  Earlier horse and carriage networks may not have had well defined rules for sharing the road as they may have even went off road, there was still some sense of organization on the road to avoid collisions.  This same idea was carried over to automobile networks.  However, more stringent protocols were required since these new motor vehicles were more dangerous than a horse and carriage.  Likewise, road maps similar to maps that were established for railroad networks were developed for automobiles especially when more highway systems started to be developed.  Highway systems were set up similar to roadway systems in that they were designed to connect major cities.

Many policies and agencies needed to be created to organize the automobile network.  New laws were put in place to keep people safe on the roads.  For instance, the first speed limit was put in place in Connecticut.  In 1901, you could go no faster than 10 mph in cities, 15 mph in villages and 20 mph in rural areas in Connecticut.  (Speed n.d.)  This soon spread to other states implementing similar laws to keep drivers safe on the roads.  

Agencies were created to help implement safety on the roads and deal with automobile related policy.  In 1902, the American Automobile Association (AAA) was created.  AAA was created in Chicago primarily because groups of motor clubs felt there was inadequate attention being paid to roads and highways suitable for automobiles.  In 1905, AAA put out a serious of road maps so people could navigate their way around the country.  (AAA n.d.)  In 1936, it was AAA who published the first driver education program to teach high school students the rules of the road, however rules were in place since 1910 in the United States regarding needing a drivers license to operate a motor vehicle.  The first licensing law for motor vehicles was implemented in New York and was initially applied to professional chauffeurs.  It wasn’t until 1913 in New Jersey that all drivers were required to pass a mandatory exam before receiving a license.  (New York Times 1913)  AAA also began a pedestrian safety program with a grant from the Automotive Safety Foundation and in 1938, published a study to try and reduce the amount of pedestrian fatalities and injuries.  

In addition to AAA, government organizations were developed such as the state Department of Transportation organizations who were responsible for implementing and maintaining roads and motor vehicle safety standards for each state.  In addition, an extensive network of signs and traffic signals contributed to an intricate language that drivers quickly adapted to.  Stop signs and red lights soon became signals that cars needed to stop.  These types of rules of the road allowed for safer driving and kept some order on the crowded roads and highways.
In relation to the plot produced in the beginning of this report, the birthing phase, or the start of motor vehicle related fatalities started almost simultaneously with the birth of the automobile.  Early automobiles were built with no real safety features and heavy metals so when accidents occurred, there was little to protect passengers.  Advancements in safety features and the use of lighter weight materials over the years has helped address these issues.

==Growth of the Mode==
The automobile industry has shown significant growth due to innovative technology and high demand by the public.  This has been helped by both the private and public sectors.  When automobile manufacturers run out of industry supported research and development, it is up to federal policies and investments to re-ignite the flame and inspire creative and innovative options that will ensure cars keep their competitive advantage over other modes of transportation.  

Innovation in the automobile industry can arise from a few main sources.  Automotive assemblers such as General Motors, Ford and Toyota can spark innovation from within.  Firms may choose to support the auto industry with components and subsystems.  (Klier and Sands 2010)  Universities as well as public and private research can help accelerate the development of technology as well.  The problem with some of these sources is their interest in the overall industry.  For example, a firm might focus on the needs of the market and build automobiles that would sell in large quantities at high prices so that they would make a lot of money.  This is not in the best interest of the industry however, as it is more important to invest in new technologies that will help mold automobiles into something newer and better instead of something shinier or bigger.  

The private sector of the automobile industry extends far beyond the automobile makers themselves.  Private sector efforts encompass an auto makers entire supply chain.  (Klier and Sands 2010)  In order to overcome some of the externalities associated with the private sector, the government is often needed to step in and implement policies that will better benefit the public.  One of the government policies that has been adopted includes research on more fuel efficient vehicles.  

Sometimes however, federal policy and programs can limit advancements in technology.  For instance, federally funded programs don’t always sufficiently target the research and development capabilities of the supply base.  (Klier and Sands 2010)  An example of this is the U.S. Council for Automotive Research which was established in 1992.  This private-public research partnership was established to further research collaboration between the Big Three automakers.  The problem with this is that the supply base often has no access to the new research and innovation ideas so they are never able to be implemented.  Another issue with this is that this type of partnership doesn’t always drive cutting edge innovations.  In most cases, car manufacturers tend to introduce innovation in production vehicles only if they will in turn make a lot of money from the design.  In order to maintain the growth of vehicles it is important to spur innovation that will allow the market to stay globally competitive.  

While there are drawbacks to federal involvement in the auto industry, the federal government has done a lot to help further the growth phase of this industry.  During the 1960s the government created vehicle safety and emmission-control laws and the average fuel economy rules in the 1970s.  These efforts led to the use of seatbelts, the introduction of the catalytic converter and more fuel efficient engines.  (Klier and Sands 2010)  These contributions helped improve the safety and performance of vehicles and helped grow the industry.

==The Mature Phase==
After the growth phase comes a maturity phase, or a period of time when growth levels off and a peak is reached.  It is during this phase that the government will typically correct flaws in the market and promote new technologies.  The firm can either invest in new ideas or exploit ideas in an attempt to spark growth.  The market will then play out in response to changes by the government or firm.  

During the mature phase of the automobile industry, attempts were made by the government to try and make the market more competitive.  In 2007, Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act which was intended to increase fuel efficiency requirements for new vehicles. (Klier and Sands 2010)  While this is a step towards making the U.S. automobile industry more competitive with the rest of the world, it does not come close to what Western Europe and Japan are doing in terms of research and development on fuel efficiency.

Often times consumers demand or want to see changes made but are constrained by lock-in conditions in which a customer is dependent on vendors for their products and don’t really have a choice but to settle for what is being offered to them in the current market.  An example of this could be with new features on the dashboards of cars.  Often times parts on the dashboard are designed to be interchangeable.  However, sometimes vendors will sell unusual sized parts or out of the ordinary items which won’t fit with the cars design.  This is where the U.S. Department of Transportation steps in to ensure this doesn’t happen and that the consumer isn’t being taken advantage of.
In order to get around vendor lock in type situations and spark innovation in mature phases, the government should look to provide more incentives for the consumer.  For example in regards to vehicles with better fuel economy, the government could implement a gasoline tax which would encourage the use of more fuel efficient vehicles because people would not be happy paying more at the pump.  

In order to further re-invent the automobile industry, the government should also continue to support new research.  The government can initiate research by direct grants and by working closely with other federal agencies to ensure they have the support they need for research and development.  It is important for the government not to pick winning solutions, and instead fund a variety of competing technologies so that the best alternative or innovation can rise from the pack.  (Klier and Sands 2010)  Another proposed idea is that the United States Department of Transportation should develop a facility to test new automotive technologies, which are submitted by manufacturers at the prototype stage.  This would provide car manufacturers with an early indication of potential new technologies and make information on innovative parts more accessible to car manufacturers in the United States. 

==Conclusions==
Since its birth in the late 1800s, the automobile industry has experienced periods of growth and maturity.  Advances in technology have allowed this to remain a primary mode of transportation for commuters in the United States.  Early technology has changed significantly to keep up with market development.  While there have been motor vehicle fatalities that have happened since the birth of the automobile industry, fatalities have been in a general trend of decline for the last 40 years.  Improvements in safety and vehicle design have kept people safe and kept the market interested in the industry.  Only time will tell if the steps government and the private sector today are enhancing technology and innovation to keep the automobile a competitive mode in the transportation industry.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Often beginners end up with so much advice that it may feel as it is a life-and-death decision. However, within broad limits, as a beginner it does not matter what boots you have provided that they are comfortable and fit well. They should be snug in the heels and support the ankles to prevent them from caving in. Most important of all though, is that they help you to feel confident. That will help you more than anything else. Provided you are not in pain and are well supported and comfortable, practice and
effort will make a far bigger difference than the exact type or brand of boot.

=== Selecting new boots ===

Intermediate and advanced boots and blades are sold separately and mounted by the skate shop. Beginner boots may be sold in
pre-assembled sets, but avoid those that have the blades riveted to or molded into a plastic sole. For adults, the boots should fit
snugly on your feet such that the tips of your toes just brush or can stretch to reach the toe of the boot. Good quality beginner
boots are moderately stiff to provide adequate support, and the more advanced boots get progressively stiffer.

The advantage of stiff boots is that they may last many years and provide good support. Their disadvantage is that they have a long and perhaps painful break-in period and they are more expensive. If you buy boots too advanced for your level, you may find them virtually impossible to break in. Lighter boots on the other hand are more comfortable and break in faster. They also wear out faster.

Before choosing boots, here is a checklist of some questions to ask yourself. The boots you buy will depend entirely upon the
answers:
*How much do you enjoy skating? Do you feel that in time you will be skating daily or is it something you just want to do once a week or so?
*How long do you envision yourself skating? Do you think you have found a sport that will keep you happily exercising for the next 20 years?
*What are your future expectations?. Many skaters who initially cannot imagine ever doing a three-turn progress farther than they ever imagined. Ask yourself what your dreams are.

If you feel that you could easily end up skating every day, you will probably want to skate for the next 20 years, and in your
fantasies you are landing double jumps, then the cost of your boots will in all likelihood be the least expense you have to worry
about over the next three years. And a good boot will probably last that long.

Whatever make of skating boots you buy, it is most important that the boots fit properly (your foot should be held firmly by the
boot) and show first class workmanship. When trying on boots, wear the same socks/tights that you will skate in. Thick socks are not a good idea as they will allow the foot to move in the skate. The construction of the boot tongue is also important, since a
relatively stiff padded tongue will stay in place and keeps the pressure of individual laces injuring your feet. Some tongues have
a padded lambs wool lining, but tongues of higher level skates are generally padded with a foam rubber. The foam rubber should be
about 3/8 - 1/2 inches thick and fairly stiff with small pores.

It is difficult to relate the size of the boot to your shoe size as this varies from one manufacturer to another. Ask to be measured by a competent vendor. They should have you sit and put a little pressure on the measuring board. Try on the boots before having the blade mounted, and do not hesitate to try others if you are not entirely satisfied with the fit.

Custom fitted boots are usually not necessary for starting skaters unless your feet and ankles are shaped unusually or have been injured, you require extra support for your weight or are skating very frequently.

=== Breaking in new boots ===

Wearing brand new boots for the first time can be painful. Here are some tips to help relieve the pain and shorten the process:

*Wear thin socks. Basically, you want the socks to slide against the leather. Thin polyester socks are good in this respect. Skate for short periods at first paying attention to the way your feet feel and stop if there is chafing or irritation. Never ignore discomfort because it can turn into blisters and infection.

*If the top rim of your boots rubs your legs, buy some cloth medical tape and moleskin to protect the irritated areas. Silicon gel ankle sleeves or pads (e.g., Bungapads) are excellent to prevent blisters, lace-bite and protect chafed skin. If the finish of the rim feels rough, it is possible to smooth it by sanding it carefully.

*You can get boots &quot;punched out&quot; or stretched where they are hurting your feet, customizing them to some degree (this leaves marks on the leather which almost disappear in time). Some skate shops can do this.

*Do not lace the boots right to the top at first. 

* To make the boots fit the contours of your ankle bones, find a wooden dowel (''e.g''. broom handle) about the diameter of the projections of your ankle joints and cut two lengths equal to the width across each ankle. Using tape and a marker, mark the location of your ankle bones on each boot (on top of the tape). Then, when not wearing the boots, insert the dowels, lining them up with the marks, and lace the boots up tightly. Similarly, a shoe tree or other solid object placed in the toe will help to relieve pressure on the toes.

* If the boots feel very uncomfortable, you can try to accelerate the break-in process by wetting the leather: For example, putting on wet tights or socks and wearing the boots while not skating, or taking a couple of damp hot hand towels put them in the boots for a few minutes, then remove the towels and wear the boots for a while. However, be aware that wearing the boots while not skating can lead to an incorrect break-in pattern (since you apply most pressure on different points when you are skating than when walking or sitting in the boots).

=== Maintenance ===

Boots are expensive and deserve all the care you give them. Be sure to dry the entire sole of your boot off immediately after leaving the ice and do not store them in a closed bag. When not in use, always remove them from the skate bag and leave the skates in the open so that the air can thoroughly dry them, otherwise the leather will start to decay. Scratches and nicks in the boots
should be attended to before water penetrates the leather.

==== Waterproofing ====
Waterproofing should be applied to the entire sole before the blades are mounted, and reapplied periodically. If leather gets wet and cannot dry out, it will start to rot and then will not hold the blade screws. A variety of types of waterproofing are available at skate shops. Here are a few ideas:

*A sole enamel can be used. It comes in black and neutral. Depending on the amount of skating you do, it may need to be reapplied monthly. It will build up and occasionally must be sanded or scraped off, then reapplied.
*A variety of bee wax or similar wax-like products are popular. They are applied then melted in with a hair dryer. Wax must be reapplied more frequently than enamel but is very easy to use. There is no sanding or buildup. After repeated use, the soles may develop a grayish cast.
*Another suggestion is polyurethane varnish thinned down so it soaks into the fresh leather. Applied in many thin coats, it is said to require very little follow-up maintenance.
*Shoe polish is a very effective water proofer but must be used very regularly.
*On white uppers, black streaks can be easily removed with a solvent made for this purpose. Use a buff type liquid polish on white boots. For black boots, use a black liquid or canned shoe polish.

==== Re-plugging the screw holes ====

You should periodically check the screws which hold the blades on, especially when the skates are new and make sure they are tight. If a screw is stripped or will not stay tight, water is probably getting inside the screw hole and the leather of the sole itself causing the holes to expand and soften. What you should do is bring your skates to a reputable skate shop and have them take the blades off, sand off the top layer of enamel, re-plug the holes, and re-coat the soles before putting the blades back on. They will put screws in new holes wherever possible. If the soles are really rotted out, then your only option other than replacement is to send them back to the manufacturer to get new soles or buy new boots.

Repeated removal of the screws is undesirable. The threads in the holes will strip after a few remove/mount cycles. Then you will have to use different holes, and if they are all stripped, you need to repair the holes. Although it is best to leave this kind of maintenance to the sharpener, you can plug the hole yourself in an emergency: Take a piece of leather lace and cram it into the hole together with lots of leather or hide glue. If you do not have any leather laces, slice off a little piece of a wooden matchstick, put the matchstick into the hole, and replace the screw.

If the the screw is really rusted or seems rounded off, get a new one. You might have to drill or poke a starter hole for the new screw. In this case it is better to let your skate shop can do the dirty job for you.

=== Selecting used boots ===

*The boot must support you, otherwise you will be expending most of your energy just holding your ankles straight. Grasp the boot by the top of the ankle and hold it sideways (parallel to the floor). If it droops, it will not provide you the ankle support you need, so do not buy it. 

*Look at the condition of the boot - it should be leather and not some kind of plastic or pseudo leather with a cloth lining. There should be no cracks or tears in the leather, though some creases are fine.

*Your best bet is to check any rinks in your area; see if the skate shop, rink office or pros/instructors have any used boots for sale. If there is a bulletin board or skate club, check any advertisements or advertise that you are looking for size-N skates.

=== When to replace your boots ===

There are some relatively objective signs that a boot has worn out or is being used beyond it's limitations and others that are
purely subjective or require reference to a coach. Certainly, a skate is finished if the leather in the boot has started to wear
out, if there are fissures in the inner lining, rips or tears in the outer boot or a cracked or crumbling sole that does not hold screws.

Judging when a boot no longer offers adequate support is more difficult. If the top flops over of its own accord, it is obvious,
but more subtle signs are when the normal creases which afford forward flexibility begin to look like accordion pleats that go all the way around the skate; this a sign that the boot is free to flex sideways at the ankle.

Some more subjective signs are the feeling that you need to tighten the laces more to make things work, even though they are
still tight, or the feeling that your foot is free to slide around in the skate, or your heel lifts even when the laces are tight. You might also feel that you are having trouble keeping your ankles erect or holding clean edges on tight edges, turns, spins or jump landings.

On the final front, your coach/instructor may make observations that your boots are not doing their job or suggest that it is time to upgrade. This may be based on close observation or rule-of-thumb. Asking your instructor is always a good idea, while talking with other skaters can either be helpful or lead to a lot of confusion.

Keep in mind that boot requirements are highly relative. Given the model of boot that you have and the amount of wear you have put on them, they may be entirely adequate for what you are doing, or they may be an obstacle to further progress. A recommendation on buying new skates might differ depending on whether you are skating recreationally and just interested in picking up some jumps, or planning to go to multi-rotational jumps as quickly as possible to get into serious competition. Also, the recommendation for a petite woman would be different from that for or a mid-sized or larger man.

=== Lacing ===

Getting your skates laced properly will enhance your balance and control and make your skates more comfortable. 

*First, loosen the laces completely and position your foot when lacing; do not just step in the skate and lace it up, but set your heel firmly in the rear when tightening the eyelet area up.
*Second, you do not have to lace all areas equally tightly. Put in overhand twists (like the first step of tying the bow) at strategic places to keep the laces from &quot;evening out&quot;. Remove the slack through the first 3 or 4 holes but do not tighten too much or you will stop blood circulation to your feet. 
*Tie a twist (optional), then lace tightly for the rest of the holes to hold your ankle firm. At the top of the holes tie a double twist, and cross-lace the hooks (that is, lace them so they are crossed at the hooks). For the last two hooks, lace fairly loosely so you can bend your ankle.
*When breaking in new skates, you can leave the top hooks unlaced and skip the top hole to make them more comfortable and start a crease in the leather at the ankle.

==== Preventing lace bite ====

Lace bite arises from pressure of the laces over the extensor ''hallucis'' tendon, which runs from the front of the lower leg to the base of the big toe. Lace bite can result in the appearance of cysts and bumps and, in the long term, the development of tendinitis. Silicon sleeves or pads applied over the tendon are very effective to prevent or alleviate the problem. If
you start experiencing this problem as the boots age, you can also get the boot tongue rebuilt by the boot manufacturer.

=== Skates for children===

Every parent has had the experience with buying shoes or other clothing for a growing child and having them no longer fit after only a few weeks  due to a growth spurt. Unfortunately, feet grow erratically, and the growth is not
always accompanied by an increase in height. You must avoid buying children's skates too loose, they will interfere with the skating and may actually be dangerous because of lack of support. They may also repeatedly raise blisters. On the other hand, if they become too small and have your skater continue to skate in them, either the child will quit, or the skating will suffer, or the feet will suffer, perhaps permanently.

To check the fit of the skates your child has now, ask her or him to put their skates on loose and push their foot right to the front of the boot. If you can put an index finger between his heel and the back of the boot, he has enough room to grow. When he skates, check to see if his skates are perfectly upright.

The only way to lessen the economic impact of keeping children's feet in skates that fit is to buy used skates on consignment, or at skate swaps, and to sell your outgrown skates as well. Used children's skates are very available and usually in far better shape than used adult skates. Get the children's coach to help you select them.

You can buy gender neutral brown boots if you plan to have the skates passed on from girl to boy or vice-versa.

==== New designs for figure skating boots ====

Despite a more rigid construction to withstand repeated jumping and a gradual introduction of new materials to make the boot lighter, the figure skating boot design has not changed radically for over a century. Several causes are mentioned:

*Leather gradually molds to the foot and the combination of suppleness and rigidity helps acquire the fine control of the skate required for complex footwork
*Traditional figure skating boots conform to the sport aesthetics. Imagine how a pretty sequined dress with go with metal buckled shiny x-treme plastic boot...
*When asked for advice about equipment, coaches and experienced skaters tend to suggest established &quot;tried and tested&quot;. Few are willing to try anything new that does not provide an obvious and immediate advantage.

A recent development that is enjoying certain popularity is a boot with a hinge at
the ankle, allowing a larger motion range that the traditional boot. The design allows skaters to point their toes further down during a jump and absorb a greater part of the impact with the toe-pick, decreasing the load by an estimated 20-30% on the knees, hips and lower back. 

Although hinged boots have been developed for freestylers, ice dancers mention that they create a more attractive line than the traditional boot when the free foot is pointed; note that because the ankle piece has a rubber edge that has to stretch as the foot is pointed, it requires strong calves to achieve maximum extension.

It has been suggested that the ankle hinge might require a technique readjustment on the part of the skater, because the
increased motion range at the angle may affect weight shifting to different parts of the blade during footwork. On the other hand, an adaptation period is usually the norm when changing to new
skates.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Alkaline batteries are a type of primary batteries. The alkaline battery gets its name because it has an alkaline electrolyte of potassium hydroxide, instead of the acidic ammonium chloride or zinc chloride electrolyte of the zinc-carbon batteries.
[[File:Rechargeable alkaline battery.jpg|thumb|Rechargeable alkaline battery]]

==History==
The alkaline dry battery was invented by Lewis Urry in the 1950s.

==Advantages and Disadvantages==
===Advantages===
* Alkaline batteries have longer shelf life than other batteries of the chloride type electrolyte batteries.
* They have a much higher energy density compared with other batteries. This allows the battery to produce the same energy while lasting longer than other   batteries.
* The rechargeable alkaline battery can be used hundreds of time if recharging is done after the battery has been used to only 25 percent of its capacity.
* Costs of an alkaline battery are much lower than the other more sophisticated ones containing nickel and cadmium.
* Alkaline batteries can be disposed off as normal waste and do not require any special disposal techniques.
* Alkaline batteries function well even at very low temperatures.
* Alkaline batteries can be stored at room temperature for two years and retain 90 percent of their original capacities.

===Disadvantages===
* Alkaline batteries are bulkier than other lithium batteries which give much higher energy.
* Alkaline batteries have a high internal resistance. This reduces the output.
* A defective battery charger can cause the alkaline batteries to explode. 
* Alkaline batteries kept in devices that are not used for a long time, can leak and thus completely ruin the device itself because of the corrosive nature of the leaked material.
  
==Safety concerns==
* Potassium hydroxide is contained within the cells of alkaline batteries. The potassium hydroxide can leak out of the battery cell if they are damaged or mishandled, causing severe chemical burns if the substance comes into contact with your skin or eyes.

be if the rental skates at your rink are in really horrible shape, in which case you may want to check if the shop or any rink/club
bulletin board has used skates for sale. If you find you enjoy skating and you want to do it regularly, it is best to invest on your own equipment.

If you cannot make your mind whether you would like to buy figure or hockey, do not worry too much, as you can learn basic on both types of skates. Once you can do more than skate around in one direction you will find out if you prefer an aggressive style of skating, with lots of quick stops and starts and sharp changes of direction or if you prefer the fluidity of figure skating. If you like jumping or spinning you should definitely get figure skates.

Although in beginner figure skates the boots and blades are often sold as a unit, advanced ones are purchased separately.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition and Use in Classical Economics==

:The concept of self-interest and its application in classical economics is distinct from that of the related notion of selfishness. Although often used interchangeably in everyday speech, within economics these terms can mean very different things. In ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', intellectual father of capitalism Adam Smith explains the difference between the two words in terms of their effect on society. Smith argues that society benefits when an individual acts in one’s own self-interest, while selfish actions result in the creation of one individual’s happiness at the cost of another’s&lt;ref name =&quot;reference Smith&quot;&gt;Smith, Freidman, and Self-Interest in Ethical Society. Harvey S. James, Jr and Farhad Rassekh. http://ehis.ebscohost.com.ezproxy2.library.arizona.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=61430ecc-94b9-44fd-8fdb-df0abaf8f4e6%4 Business Ethics Quarterly, Jul., 2000, vol 10, no. 3, p. 659-674.&lt;/ref&gt;.


:In order to grasp the idea of self-interest, one could examine the actions of homo economicus, a hypothetical figure within classical economics whose actions are completely rational. Homo economicus is said to operate according to the self-interest axiom, which is “the assumption that individuals seek to maximize their own material gains in &lt;br/&gt;interactions and expect others to do the same”&lt;ref name = &quot;reference two&quot;&gt;. Irrational Economist, The: Making Decisions in A Dangerous World.

Economic fluctuations.&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus , according to the axiom of self-interest, a rational man will always behave in ways that maximize his own well-being &lt;ref name = &quot;reference two&quot;/&gt;.

==Self-Interest in Behavioral Economics==

:As a field of study, behavioral economics developed out of the inability of classical economics to adequately predict the actions of individuals. The discipline integrates psychology, sociology, and pure economic theory with the intention of creating a more accurate understanding of how humans make economic decisions&lt;ref name = &quot;reference three&quot;&gt;Thaler, Richard H. and Sendhil Mullainathan. “How Behavioral Economics Differs from Traditional Economics”. Library of Economics and Liberty. 2008. Accessed 9 October 2011 from http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/BehavioralEconomics.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Behavioral economics challenges the axiom of self-interest by investigating circumstances in which individuals are motivated by factors other than self-betterment. The following sections will explore instances of human behavior that differ from the predicted rational decisions of homo economicus.

==The Extent of Self-Interest==
:While classic economic theory describes individuals as being primarily motivated by self-interest,  behavioral economics argues that  psychological and societal influences hinder one’s ability to pursue their own self-interest&lt;ref name = &quot;reference three&quot;/&gt;. In his thought-provoking work ''Predictably Irrational'', Duke University professor of psychology and behavioral economics Dan Ariely discusses the results of his research into the limitations of self-serving behavior. Intrigued by the large gap between financial losses due to robberies and losses caused by employer fraud, Ariely conducted a series of experiments at large universities across the United States. One experiment, originally performed at the Harvard School of Business, was designed to investigate how the opportunity to act in one’s own self-interest influences behavior&lt;ref name =&quot;reference four&quot;&gt;Ariely, Dan. Predictably Irrational. New York: Harper Collins, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;.
:The study tested four groups, the first of which was asked to complete a fifty question multiple choice test, transfer their answers to a bubble sheet, and report their score to the administrator, who would give the subject ten cents for each correct answer. Each successive group encountered the same multiple choice exam, but was tempted to cheat in some way. Group Two was given a bubble sheet that had the correct answers pre-bubbled in, Group Three was able to shred their test and just hand in the pre-answered bubble sheet, and Group Four was given the opportunity to destroy both their bubble sheet and their exam and then remove the appropriate amount of money from a jar at the front of the testing room&lt;ref name= &quot;reference four&quot;/&gt;.
:The results from the above experiment were as follows: Group One averaged a score of 32.6 questions out of 50, Group Two reported 36.2 correct answers, Group Three averaged 35.9, and Group Four claimed to answer 36.1 correctly. Perhaps what is most intriguing about this data is that it suggests that individuals, when given the opportunity, will act in their own self-interest, but only to a certain extent. Subjects in Group Four could have easily reported perfect scores and collected $5.00 from the jar, yet they only boosted their earnings by an average of $.35&lt;ref name= &quot;reference four&quot;/&gt;. Ariely’s research suggests that there is some factor other than self-interest that influences the decision-making process.

==Reputation and Conscience==
:Within social situations, perhaps two of the greatest influences on behavior are peer judgment and the desire to maintain a reputation. According to professor of moral philosophy Francis Hutcheson, self-interest is counter-acted by the need to be accepted by others&lt;ref name=&quot;reference six&quot;&gt;Whybrow, Peter C. American Mania: When More is Not Enough. New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition to his above-mentioned work on the extent to which individuals will pursue their own self-interest, Dan Ariely conducted an experiment at the University of California in Los Angeles to investigate how imposed value systems affect behavior.&lt;br /&gt;
 
:Ariely’s study was simple in its design: three groups, each subject to different testing conditions,  took a ten question multiple-choice exam. Group One served as a control group and was not given the opportunity to cheat on the test, while groups Two and Three received a pre-bubbled answer sheet. Members of Group Two were given the additional instructions to construct a list of ten books they read over the summer before attempting the questions. Similarly, subjects in Group Three were prompted to list the Ten Commandments before beginning the test&lt;ref name =&quot;reference four&quot;/&gt;

:The results of this investigation suggest that humans ''do'' respond to external judgment, or at the very least ''perceived'' social judgment. Group One, the control group, established an average score on the exam of 3.1. Group Two, likely because of their access to the correct answers, obtained a slightly higher score of 4.1. One may have postulated that Group Three would also achieve an above-average score, as they had been given the pre-bubbled answer sheet as well. However, this group only managed to answer 3 out of the ten questions correctly. In his work ''Predictably Irrational'', Dan Ariely postulates that being forced to recall socially constructed systems of morality effectively strengthens one’s conscience&lt;ref name =&quot;reference four&quot;/&gt;. In other words, reminding individuals of appropriate ethical conduct increases the probability that they will adhere to these behaviors, despite the fact that they may conflict with their own self-interest.

==Cross-Cultural Evidence Against Self-Interest==
:Thus far, our discussion of the self-interest axiom has relied entirely upon experiments which took place within the United States. Although there is certainly value in investigating the behavior of individuals within a capitalist society, failing to consider other societies would result in an extremely narrow understanding of human nature. This section will seek to explore how self-interest manifests itself in societies whose economic and social structures differ from those of the United States. &lt;br /&gt;
:In the mid 1990s, a group of curious behavioral economists designed and conducted a cross-cultural experiment that investigated the degree to which members of other societies pursue their own self-interest. The experiment consisted of three simulations in fifteen small-scale societies around the world. The societies chosen spanned four continents and represented a wide variety of economic systems, ranging from nomadic herding to slash-and-burn horticulture &lt;ref name= &quot;behavior&quot;&gt; Henrich,Joseph Robert Boyd, Samuel Bowles, Colin Camerer, Ernst Fehr, Herbert Gintis, Richard McElreath, Michael Alvard, Abigail Barr, Jean Ensminger, Natalie Smith Henrich, Kim Hill, Francisco Gil-White, Michael Gurven, Frank W. Marlowe, John Q. Patton and David Tracer (2005). “Economic man” in cross-cultural perspective: Behavioral experiments in 15 small-scale societies. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 28, pp 795-815 doi:10.1017/S0140525X050000142&lt;/ref&gt;.
:The first simulation is more commonly referred to as the Ultimatum Game.  The game is played with two players, the first of which is given the ability to divide a sum of money and offer a portion to player two. Player two can then either accept player one’s offer, in which case both players receive their money, or player two can reject the offer, in which case both players leave empty-handed. Game theorists argue that, if a completely rational individual were to play the Ultimatum Game, as player one they would offer the lowest portion of the money and as player two they would accept any non-zero offer. From the point of view of this rational player, simply leaving the game with more than they entered makes them better off. When the Ultimatum Game is played in the United States, the average offer made by player one is between 43% and 48%. In this study, the mean offer ranged from 26% to 58%. Several societies also had curious reactions to certain offers. For example, the Machiguenga, a hunter-gatherer society, rejected only one offer, even though three-quarters of all offers made were below 30%. Also interesting is the way in which the Au and Gnau of Papau New Guinea rejected both extremely low and extremely high offers, perhaps suggesting that the latter divisions were too fair &lt;ref name= &quot;behavior&quot;/&gt;.
:The next simulation used is similar to the Ultimatum Game, but player two is not able to reject the offer. This game is often used to remove the possibility that players are making offers out of fear of rejection. American subjects playing this game have a modal offer of 0%, which is consistent with the predicted “rational” division.  Of the fifteen societies studied, only two exhibited behavior similar to that of Americans &lt;ref name= &quot;behavior&quot;/&gt;. These results indicate that something other than self-interest is affecting the way in which members of other societies make economic decisions.
:The last simulation explores how individuals behave when their own interests interfere with those of society. These interactions are known as Public Goods Games, and the primary simulation used in this study was the Voluntary Contributions Game. In the Voluntary Contributions Game, each player receives an endowment at the beginning of the round. Players must then choose how much of this sum they wish to contribute to a communal pot, the contents of which are doubled and then redistributed at the end of the round. Completely rational players would choose to donate nothing to the community and earn money off the generosity of other players. Some societies, such as the Orma and Huinca, defy this behavior with modal contributions at 100% and 40%-50%, and with no instances of defection &lt;ref name= &quot;behavior&quot;/&gt;. Such evidence suggests that the axiom of self-interest cannot adequately predict the general behavior of all cultures.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Invention of Calculus ==

Despite currently being a near-universal component of mathematics, computer science, natural science and engineering education, the basic ideas of calculus only came into being in the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century in Europe. This work was predominantly done by two men: Sir Isaac Newton&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, James. Calculus: Early Transcendentals, 7th ed.&lt;/ref&gt;, an English scientist most famous for his three laws of motion and law of gravity, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, a German who is far less famous in the non-scientific community. They developed their ideas independently, although this has been disputed by parties from both countries, as both countries wished to take credit for the discovery. However, many textbooks today credit both men.

Newton invented his version of calculus in 1666&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, James. Calculus: Early Transcendentals, 7th ed.&lt;/ref&gt; while Cambridge University was closed during the Plague. Despite entering the school with little knowledge of mathematics, he attended the lectures of Isaac Barrow, where he learned, among other things, of the methods Barrow used to determine tangent lines. These methods would prove influential on Newton, who would later develop his own methods as part of his differential calculus. During this break from Cambridge, Newton continued his research, making many of his notable discoveries all in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, James. Calculus: Early Transcendentals, 7th ed.&lt;/ref&gt; These include his three laws of motion, how to represent functions as sums of infinite series, the universal law of gravitation (now superseded by Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity), and an explanation of the dispersion of light to form a rainbow. Newton's version of calculus was heavily applied to develop his laws of motion, although they may be re-formulated without the use of calculus. 

Newton's Second Law of motion, for example, was originally written '''F''' = d'''p'''/dt (in modern notation), where p stands for the momentum of an object (then called &quot;the quantity of motion&quot; by Newton.) This was the form Newton used to solve his problems, including a proof of Kepler's laws of planetary motion. The formula may be simplified to the better-known (and more commonly used in the most elementary mechanics) form '''F''' = m'''a''' by the following argument. 

Suppose a point particle of mass m is pushed by a net force '''F''' in a given direction. Then '''F''' = d'''p'''/dt. But this mass is constant, so it is unaffected by the motion of the object. Assuming the relativistic effects are negligible, '''p''' = m'''v''', so dp = d(m'''v''') = m (d'''v'''). Then, factoring out the m, d'''p'''/dt = m[(d'''v''')/dt]. However, this is simply the formula for instantaneous acceleration, so '''F''' = m'''a'''. Newton never wrote his equation in this form, leaving force as the time derivative of momentum instead. 

Newton's notation was significantly different from that in common use today, as was the name for the science he invented: &quot;the science of fluxions.&quot; Instead of the (now) common f'(x) notation for the derivative of f with respect to x, Newton employed a notation that used dots over the heads of a variable that was to be differentiated. This notation had some notable flaws; they can conflict with the use of the arrow notation for vectors and also give no indication of what variable is to be differentiated with respect to. Newton, however, used this notation for derivatives with respect to time. 

\dot{x} was the symbol Newton used to denote the derivative of x with respect to time. The second derivative, as occurs, for example, in the definition of acceleration, was written \ddot{x}. Though this may be extended to include an arbitrary number of derivatives, its use has fallen out of style, except in mechanics, and both Lagrange's f'(x) notation and Leibniz's notation df/dt are more frequently used today in most branches of mathematics. Newton's notation was not wholly consistent; his &quot;dot&quot; notation was developed after writing ''Principia Mathematica,'' his best-known work, and he used geometrical arguments and none of his dot notation to explain the planetary motions he described therein&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton. Wikipedia page.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton's work has come under a considerable amount of critisiscm. Notably, Newton's 1st law of motion, the law of inertia, has been attacked for being stolen from the work of Galileo; his corpuscle (particle) theory of light has been revoked both by Christian Huygens' wave theory and later by quantum mechanics, and, as previously mentioned, his laws of gravitation have been replaced by the theory of relativity. Newton's calculus, in the eyes of some pure mathematicians, was also riddled with errors. At the time, much of this controversy centered around Newton's use of infinitesimals. [Additional work needed on clarification of Newton's use of infinitesimals.]

      <comment>Changed general IE2 eq. From 'j + Mg' to 'j + energy'</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOC right}}

When we study the trends in the periodic table, we cannot stop at just atomic size. In this section of the chapter, we will begin an understanding of an important concept, namely ionization energy and recognize its trend on the Periodic Table.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Define ionization energy.
* Describe the trend that exists in the Periodic Table for ionization energy.
* Describe the ionic size trend that exists when elements lose one electron.

==Ionization Energy is the Energy Required to Remove an Electron==
Lithium has an electron configuration of 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Lithium has one electron in its outermost energy level. In order to remove this electron, energy must be added to the system. Look at the equation below:

:{| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\text{energy} + \text{Li}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\text{Li}^+ + e^-\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;1s^22s^1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &amp;nbsp; || &lt;math&gt;1s^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|}

With the addition of energy, a lithium ion can be formed from the lithium atom by losing one electron. This energy is known as the ionization energy. The '''ionization energy''' is the energy required to remove the most loosely held electron from a gaseous atom or ion. &quot;In the gaseous phase&quot; is specified because in liquid or solid, other energies get involved. The general equation for the ionization energy is as follows.

:&lt;math&gt;\text{energy} + \text{A} \rightarrow \text{A}^+ + e^-\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The higher the value of the ionization energy, the harder it is to remove that electron. We can see a trend when we look at the ionization energies for the elements in period 2. Table 10.7 summarizes the electron configuration and the ionization energies for the elements in the second period.

When we look closely at the data presented in Table 10.7, we can see that as we move across the period from left to right, in general, the ionization energy increases. At the beginning of the period, with the alkali metals and the alkaline earth metals, losing one or two electrons allows these atoms to become ions.

:{| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\text{energy} + \text{Li}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\text{Li}^+ + e^-\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\text{energy} + \text{Mg}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\text{Mg}^{2+} + 2e^-\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;[\text{He}] + 2s^1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;[\text{He}] + e^-\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;[\text{Ne}] + 3s^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;[\text{Ne}] + 2e^-\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|}

As we move across the period, the atoms become smaller which causes the nucleus to have greater attraction for the valence electrons. Therefore, the electrons are more difficult to remove.

A similar trend can be seen for the elements within a family. Table 10.8 shows the electron configuration and the first ionization energies (''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) for some of the elements in the first group, the alkali metals.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin:10px auto;&quot;
|+ Table 10.8: Ionization Energies for Some Group 1 Elements
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Element
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Electron Configuration
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | First Ionization Energy ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Lithium (Li) || [He]2''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; || 520 kJ/mol
|-
| Sodium (Na) || [He]3''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; || 495.5 kJ/mol
|-
| Potassium (K) || [He]4''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; || 418.7 kJ/mol
|}

Comparing the electron configurations of lithium to potassium, we know that the electron to be removed is further away from the nucleus. We know this because the ''n'' value is larger meaning the energy level where the valence electron is held is larger. Therefore it is easier to remove the most loosely held electron because the atom is larger with a greater shielding effect which means that the nucleus has less control over potassium's outer electron, 4''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Therefore ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for potassium (418.7 kJ/mol) is less than ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for lithium (520 kJ/mol).

If a second electron is to be removed from an atom, the general equations are the following:

:{| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\text{J} + \text{energy}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\text{J}^{1+} + e^-\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;padding-left:25px;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;IE_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\text{J}^+ + \text{energy}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\text{J}^{2+} + 2e^-\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;padding-left:25px;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;IE_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Since there is an imbalance of positive and negative charges when a second electron is being removed, the energy required for the second ionization (''IE''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) will be greater than the energy required for the first ionization (''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). Simply put, ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

==The Charge on the Nucleus Increases and Size Decreases==
So if we look at the ionization energy trend in the Periodic Table and add it to the trend that exists with atomic size we can show the following on our Periodic Table chart.

[[File:Ionization energy - atomic size.svg|500px|center]]

But why does the ionization energy increase going across a period and decrease going down a group? It has to do with two factors. One factor is that the atomic size decreases. The second factor is that the effective nuclear charge increases. The '''effective nuclear charge''' is the charge experienced by a specific electron within an atom. Remember, the nuclear charge was used to describe why the atomic size decreased going across a period. When we look at the data in Table 10.7 again, we can see how the effective nuclear charge increases going across a period. Table 10.9 shows the effective nuclear charge along with the ionization energy for the elements in Period 2.

The electrons that are shielding the nuclear charge are the core electrons, or in the case of Period 2, the 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; electrons. The effective nuclear charge is the difference between the total charge in the nucleus (the number of protons) and the number of shielded electrons. Notice how as the effective nuclear charge increases, so does the ionization energy. Overall the general trend for ionization energy is shown below.

[[File:Ionization energy periodic table.svg|500px|center]]
{{High School Chemistry/Example|Sample Question}}
What would be the effective nuclear charge for Cl? Would you predict the ionization energy to be higher or lower than fluorine?
----
'''Solution''':

Chlorine has the electronic configuration of [Ne]3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''p''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;

The effective nuclear charge is 7, the same as fluorine. Predicting the ionization energy would be difficult with this alone. The atomic size, however, is larger for chlorine than for fluorine because now there are three energy levels (chlorine is in Period 3). Now we can say that the ionization energy should be lower than that of fluorine because the electron would be easier to pull off the level further away from the nucleus. (Indeed, the value for chlorine is 1251 kJ/mol).

==Some Anomalies With the Trend in Ionization Energy==
There are a few anomalies that exist with respect to the ionization energy trends. Going across a period there are two ways in which the ionization energy may be affected by the electron configuration. When we look at period 3, we can see that there is an anomaly observed as we move from the 3''s'' sublevels to the 3''p'' sublevel. The table below shows the electron configurations for the main group elements in period 3 along with the first ionization energy for these elements.

|}
In the table we see that when we compare magnesium to aluminum the first ''IE'' decreases instead of increasing as we would have expected. So why would this be so? Magnesium has its outermost electrons in the ''s'' sublevel. The aluminum atom has its outermost electron in the 3''p'' sublevel. Since ''p'' electrons have just slightly more energy than ''s'' electrons, it takes a little less energy to remove that electron from aluminum. One other slight factor is that the electrons in 3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; shield the electron in 3''p''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. These two factors allow the ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for Al to be less than ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for Mg.

When we look at the table below, we can see that the ionization energy for nitrogen seems out of place.

While nitrogen has one electron occupying each of the three ''p'' orbitals in the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; sublevel, oxygen has two orbitals occupied by only one electron but one orbital containing a pair of electrons. The greater electron-electron repulsion experienced by these 2''p'' electrons allows for less energy to be needed to remove one of these. Therefore, ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for oxygen is less than nitrogen.

==Lesson Summary==
* Ionization energy is the energy required to remove the most loosely held electron from a gaseous atom or ion. Ionization energy generally increases across a period and decreases down a group. The effective nuclear charge is the charge of the nucleus felt by the valence electron.
* The effective nuclear charge and the atomic size help explain the trend of ionization energy. Going down a group the atomic size gets larger and the electrons can be more readily removed, therefore, ionization energy decreases. Going across a period the effective nuclear charge increase so the electrons are harder to remove and the ionization energy increases. Once one electron has been removed, a second electron can be removed but ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. If a third electron is removed, ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and so on.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[w:New York City Subway| New York City subway]] system has an illustrious history since its inception in the early 1900s.  From its modest beginnings in 1904 with one line opening, the New York City subway has become the largest subway system in the world completing 1.6 Billion trips a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mta.info/nyct/facts/ridership/index.htm MTA Ridership] MTA.info (12th October 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  It is hard to imagine for all of those who have taken the subway in New York City, but the 1.6 Billion trips that we see today is only 80% of the total rides seen in the years 1929 and again in 1945, despite being a significantly smaller system.  This case study will focus on the birth of the New York City subway system, including what policies were instituted to get it off the ground, then onto the growth phase seen between 1910 till 1919, and finally mark its peak in 1929 and what caused the system to level off at 2 Billion trips served in that year.

==The Subway from 1904 till 1945==
When analyzing the total rides made within the New York City subway system, the argument can be made that from 1904, when the first subway line became operation, till 1929 encompasses the entire life cycle of the mode of transportation: the birth, growth and mature phases are all encompassed.  While a peak is seen at 1929 with roughly 2 billion rides made that year, there is a decline in the 1930's (due to the [[w: Great Depression| Great Depression]], with a resurgence during the 1940's, eventually hitting to peak of 2 billion rides made.  Below is a table of total rides made on the New York City Subway:

From this data, we can use a three parameter logistic model as follows:


&lt;math&gt;R(t) = K/[1+e^{(-b(t-t_0)}]&lt;/math&gt;


Where R(t) are the total rides with respect to the year, t, K is the carrying capacity of the system (in our case, the maximum number of rides), t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[w: inflection point|inflection point]], and b is the exponential coefficient.  To find each of the three parameters, the natural log of both sides is taken and a [[w:linear regression|linear regression]] is run to best fit for the b and t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; parameters.  To estimate for K, the New York City subway reached a maximum of roughly 2 billion rides, to which the value was rounded up to 2.1 billion rides.  The following was the equation to which a linear regression was run on Microsoft Excel:


&lt;math&gt;Y = \ln\left(\cfrac{R(t)}{(K-R(t))}\right)= bt-bt_0&lt;/math&gt;


Two regression were run: first on the data between 1904 and 1929, the second on the data between 1904 and 1945.  After running both regressions, the data ending in 1929 had an [[w:R squared|R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] value of 0.95 compared to the data ending in 1945 had an R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of 0.82.  The logic for limiting the regression to 1929 was that for the exceptional circumstances the Great Depression appeared to have on the system; the birth and growth phases are accurately predicted by the logit model using the 1929 model and the mature phase could be seen as starting in 1929 when the peak rides were first made.  While the R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; value would be higher for the 1929 model if the data between 1929 and 1945 was considered, ultimately it seems as though the Great Depression was the primary factor as to decreasing ridership (as seen by the return to 2 billion rides made in 1945) and therefore will be treated as &quot;outlier&quot; data points.

[[File:NYC Subway Ridership-1904-1945.jpg|left|450px|thumb|'''Figure 1:''' Total Rides on NYC Subways from 1904 to 1945 w/logit model]]


Using the 1929 data set, b is found to be 0.215, and t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; was found to be 1916, which is indicated by the purple line in figure 1.  When considering the history of the subway line, as explored in this article, 1916 does historically line up as being an inflection point for the New York City subway.  Considering the fit of the model for the first two phases and how the model lines up with the data in 1945, it can be said that the New York City subway system has experienced an [[w: Logistic function| S-shaped curve]] so often seen for transportation modes.


The three phases have been broken down by color code in figure 1: green representing the birth phase, yellow the growth phase, and orange the mature phase.  While the dates set for each of these phases were subjective, each were decided because of historical context.  The birth phase started in 1904 with the first subway line in operation and lasted until 1910 when the [[w:Dual Contracts|Dual Contracts]] was signed between the two major rail lines and the municipal government.  The Growth Phase was from the signing of the Dual Contracts till the point when subway hit its peak in 1929.  The mature phase spanned from 1929 till 1945, when it went through a decline and rebirth up to 1945.  The purple line represents 1916, which was the calculated inflection point: when the rate of growth went from increasing to decreasing.  This article pertains specifically for this period - for further reading, please refer to [[Transportation Deployment Casebook|Transportation Deployment Casebook's]] chapter Ridership On New York City Subways.

==The Beginnings of Subway Transit==
While the first subway rail line opened in October of 1904, above ground rail in New York City began in 1868 with the [[w:IRT Ninth Avenue Line|IRT Ninth Avenue Line]].  Operated by steam locomotives, there were several companies owning a few lines apiece both in [[w:Manhattan|Manhattan]] and [[w:Brooklyn|Brooklyn]].  However, after the turn of the century, the rail lines would be consolidated into two companies: the Interborough Transit Company ([[w:Interborough Rapid Transit Company|IRT]]) and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company ([[w: Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company|BRT]]), with the IRT dominating the Manhattan market and the BRT dominating the Brooklyn market.  The above ground lines weren't the only forms of commuter transportation.  For long distance commuting, i.e. from Connecticut and Long Island, there were well established rail lines such as the [[w:Long Island Railroad|Long Island Railroad]] (LIRR) and the [[w:New York Central Railroad|New York Central Railroad]] (NYC).  Both allowed people access into New York City through Grand Central Station - at the northern extent of the [[w:Central Business District|CBD]].  Yet, both lacked the ability to move people from Grand Central further south, which left service open for the IRT, or for people to come in from southern Brooklyn, which left service open for the BRT.

Which ever gaps that were left by rail were filled in by pedestrian traffic, cars, buses, and earlier on horse-drawn rail.  For the CBD of New York, described as any part of the Manhattan south of 59th Street, all the different modes of transportation were crowding the narrow streets of New York City.  Even when the first above ground rail opened up in 1868, people were planning for an underground subway line to alleviate commuter congestion.  For example, one engineer by the name of A. P. Robinson predicted, with consideration to population trends and the increasing density, that there would be 200 million trips made in 1880 - the actual number would eventually be 288 million.&lt;ref name =&quot;Walker&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Fifty Years of Rapid Transit|last=Walker|first=James Blaine|year=1918|publisher=The Law Printing Company|location=New York City|chapterurl=http://www.nycsubway.org/articles/fifty_years_03.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was through his predictions that he thought that subway system should be constructed in order to alleviate future congestion problems that were bound to plague the city.  As you can tell, the subway system had been a point of discussion since before the [[w: American Civil War|Civil War]], yet it wasn't able to get the green light from the City of New York until 1898.  At that point, the IRT and BRT were begging to expand their operations.  The next chapter discusses what changed over the 35 years when the first elevated lines were created to push the city to making the rail run under the city.

==The Advent of Subway in New York city==
The first subway line took 6 years to complete, beginning in 1898 when the city finally approved to franchise seven new subway stations to the IRT, continuing to groundbreaking in 1900, till the first train ran the tracks in 1904.&lt;ref name = &quot;Walker&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;IRT&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last = [[w:Interborough Rapid Transit Company|Interborough Rapid Transit Company]]| title = The New York Subway: Its Construction and Equipment | year = 1991 | isbn = 0823213196 | publisher = Fordham University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the project itself took 6 years, in reality the battle to construct a subway system in New York City start much earlier and took many factors.  This article will highlight the three of them: the success of the elevated rail, the new technological advances, and the increasing population.

===Elevated Rail===
For all intents and purposes, the elevated lines in both Manhattan and Brooklyn were a success.  With the eventual formation of the BRT in 1896 and the IRT in 1900,both were able to standardize their lines for their particular train.  Both companies would also hold relative monopolies over the other: while the IRT would control trips within Manhattan, the BRT line controlled all of the commuter elevated rail in Brooklyn and had a few access points into Manhattan.  Furthermore, by being distinct lines, they did not have to offer their customers transfers from one line to another, maximizing their profits for those force to take the rail.

Ridership was expanding and the rail operation companies were able to supplement the governments in order to franchise new station construction.  Throughout the late 1800's, elevated rail companies vied for access into downtown/midtown Manhattan, extending their lines to areas with relatively low population density.  Through the success of these companies and with the experience in handling the City of New York, they felt confident in lobbying the government for a more ambitious project.  They knew that they could leverage the municipal government into franchising new stations for them and derive profits from the growing populations moving into areas that they were building out to, including Harlem and The Bronx.

===New Technologies===
There were major technological advances that were revolutionizing cities across the world.  While J.P. Robinson drew up schematics for what a subway in New York could look like, many new advances allowed for both easier construction of the subway and operations.  First and foremost, the [[w: electric locomotive|electic locomotive]] was invented and began to be deployed worldwide by 1902.  Unlike the [[w:London Underground|London Underground]], which required significant ventilation due to the steam engine usage, the electric train could be fed energy from their power station (the IRT would build its own power station to supply it energy - [[w:IRT Powerhouse| IRT Powerhouse]](http://www.nycsubway.org/articles/powerplant.html)).  Since there wasn't the necessity to keep the tunnels well ventilated, these tunnels could be built deeper underground (when [[w:cut-and-cover|cut-and-cover]] couldn't be done).  While the technology was available for the engineers to construct tunnels deep underground, it was only done when cut-and-cover could not be done: either when they had to tunnel through rock or go under the [[w:East River|East River]].  [[w:steel|Steel]] and [[w:Concrete|concrete]] were relatively new materials that enabled engineers to not only support their structure more soundly with less space, but it enabled them to build the tunnel out to support four lanes of track.  Ultimately, the four lanes of track not only increased the potential capacity, but allowed for express line services, increasing the utility of the subway lines.  Lastly, tunneling became much more sophisticated allowing for the engineers to build a tunnel under the East River to [[w:The Bronx|The Bronx]] and for in circumstances when cut-and-cover couldn't work.&lt;ref name =&quot;IRT&quot; /&gt;

===Increasing Population===
Over the 35 years since the first rapid transit bill was vetoed by the New York governor,&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot;/&gt; the population of New York increased at an astronomical pace: from 1870 till 1900, the population grew from 1,478,000 to 3,437,000.  Denser living brought about by the invention of the [[w:elevator|elevator]] and building [[w:skyscraper| skyscrapers]] required more rail transit for those living within the cities.  With the elevated lines at full capacity and the roads clogged with traffic coming from a myriad of sources, people were demanding transportation solutions; one which subways could provide.  Furthermore, places that elevated rail lines had supplied service to without significant populations were now bustling with people.  The best example of this is The Bronx, which in 1870 had a population of 37,000: at this point was still considered the hinterlands to lower Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn.  By 1900, the population had grown to 200,000 and were bustling to do business within lower Manhattan.  [[w:Harlem|Harlem]] is another example of this, where in the years leading up to the elevated lines coming in were farm land.  The elevated rail lines had allowed people to live further away from the city center, but new transportation strategy was needed to address these issues.

==Policies in the Beginning: 1898 till 1910==
By 1898, when the municipal government of New York City decided to finance a subway rail line, the government had two major things to consider: one, its prior relationship with the various rail companies, and two, how it will distribute the subway project.  Up to this point, rail projects were done as follows: either the city would build the rail and lease it out to private operating companies or private operating companies would lobby the government to build a rail and allow them to operate them by paying for a portion of the capital costs.  In 1898, the city had decided to finance the former and allow the elevated rail lines to bid for the contract.  In 1900, the Manhattan lines had consolidated to what became the IRT and won the contract to operate the first line which was to run from City hall to 145st in The Bronx. The terms of the contract stated that IRT leased the track for 99 years, and for that time would pay a portion of the operating costs directly to the city - much like they constructed past contracts with elevated rail companies.  There are two major things to consider: one, they did not include a clause on how much the rail could charge to use the subway, and two, they did not include within their contract a way for the government to funnel any profits the company made off of the subway.  Funding was especially problematic because of stat law which required the debt of a city to be no higher than 10 percent of their budget, which was set by the state government.  That meant that the initial subway project would have to remain under $30 million, and that funding would have to stream in on a year to year basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot;/&gt;  This caused some friction not only between the municipal government and the state, but also within the newly formed municipal government.  Up until 1898, Manhattan and Brooklyn were two separate cities vying for the same economic pie.  With the [[w:City of Greater New York|consolidation of the five boroughs]], they now had to work together within the same municipal government to get money for their borough.

Overnight the subway became a huge success.  As seen in figure 1, the total trips made by the single line increased from 73,000,000 to 138,000,000 within a full year of operation.  While the line had opened up in 1904, plans to extend the original stations continued until 1906 which opened up more areas that had seen this population boom.  By 1908, before which the IRT and BRT companies had been &quot;legalizing&quot; routes that could be constructed in the future, ridership had skyrocketed to 550,000,000 rides.  The newly formed Public Service Commission (the successor of the Rapid Transit Commission, which had been dissolved due to not approving of more projects sooner) began approving numerous projects: extensions to the existing line, creating a subway line in Brooklyn, etc. By 1909, engineers had looked over all the plans the new Public Service Commission had approved, to which the new lines would add 47 miles of track and cost $147 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot;/&gt;  Clearly they were not to make the same mistakes as their predecessors!  As noted earlier, the city was bound to stay under a certain debt threshold, and these new ambitious projects would be above and beyond what they could pay for themselves, so they began to negotiate with the two major lines how they were going to divide up the responsibilities towards this monumental project.

==The Growth of the Line: The Dual Contracts==
In December of 1910, negotiations began between the major rail companies, and the city for how the system was going to expand going forward.  The negotations proved to be very difficult since all three parties (the IRT, the BRT and the City) had their own agenda.  Gaining access into Manhattan was the primary goal for the BRT heads since this was more and more becoming the destination for commuters.  While the IRT tried to block this, the city government was more interested in unifying the two systems and allowing for greater access between the two systems.  The city government knew that this was the time they had the greatest leverage over the rail companies, which they saw as getting a great deal up to this point.  There were four major points that the city looked to get during these negotiations:

# Set fares across the entire system
# Take a portion of the profits the companies were taking in
# Split up Queens between the two rail lines
# Have full control over the track within 10 years time

Each of these points were a significant change in policy up until this point.  In dictating the fare price, the city government was ensuring that these companies couldn't take full advantage of the newcomers to the city who had no choice but to live on and work along the rail lines.  In the final deal, the fare would be set on 5 cents (one note for some perspective, when A.P. Robinson designed his system in 1864, he set the fare prices to 7 cents) and was not to change with inflation. One caveat the companies were able to exploit was that transfers were not honored from one train to another.  The second point was also crucial: this marked the beginning of the government getting into the rail business: they saw these companies getting rich seemingly overnight and wanted a piece of the action.  The third point was a negotiation currency that the city used to appease one company or the other.  Ultimately, the next frontier in lines would be in Queens and both companies wanted some portion of the lines that fed those areas.  Finally, and most importantly, the deal was to include a provision where the city would be allowed to own the lines within 10 years time if they so chose.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot;/&gt;

In 1913 the deal was signed and the most ambitious transportation project within New York City began.  The total cost of the project would be $347 million, where the city would contribute $150 million, $56 million from IRT in construction, another $21 million from IRT in equipment, $34 million from BRT in construction, and another $26 million from BRT in equipment.  When completed, the line would triple in capacity to supply roughly 1 billion trips to 3 billion trips, adding 334 miles of track to the already existing 303 miles of track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Dual System of Rapid Transit| url=http://www.nycsubway.org/articles/psc_dual_system_rapid_transit_1912.html| accessdate = 11 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Obviously, the ramifications of the Dual Contracts was enormous.  The city had been able to unite the two lines, allowing for greater integration in the system as a whole.  Ridership was steadily increasing and only started showing signs of slowing by 1916, breaking the 1 billion rides per year in 1917, 1.5 billion in 1922 and capping off at 2 billion in 1929.  Furthermore, the city was able to recoup more of its losses through deriving some of the profits from the companies and began drawing up plans for its own subway line, the Independent Subway System ([[w:Independent Subway System|IND]]).

Unfortunately, not all parties benefited from this equally.  In terms of splitting up Queens, while the city had made it so both IRT and BRT had to share the two lines built, both of the lines were built to IRT specifications.  This meant that in order for a BRT customer to get to Queens, they must switch trains at Queens Borough Plaza - the new hub for Queens travel.  For both companies, problems arose with the fixed fare price.  Since the fare did not change with respect to inflation, both companies lost huge amounts of revenue at the end of [[w:World War I|World War I]] due to the extreme inflation seen post war, even with the increasing ridership both during and afterwards.  This would actually push the BRT into bankruptcy in 1923, but got reincorporated as the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation ([[w:Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation|BMT]]).  The Dual Contracts had both brought about the greatest expansion in history, which could not have been achieved by either of the major rail companies at the time, but also set the stage for eventual decline.

==Market Saturation: The Unrealized 2nd Ave Line==
By 1929, the market for rapid transit had reached saturation within New York City.  At that point all of the lines agreed upon in the Dual Contract had been completed and the city was looking for future projects to start construction on.  When the city began proposed its list of future construction projects, most of the construction was to extend lines out into Queens and to interconnect the IRT and BMT lines.  Most projects never came to realization, though, due to the Great Depression.  While some of the smaller projects were completed over the period of a decade, the only major project to come to completion was the [[w:IND Eighth Avenue Line|IND Eighth Avenue Line]]: the first publicly owned subway line in New York City.  Up to this point, the city was still only obtaining a fraction of the profits that IRT and BRT/BMT lines had been getting for decades and decided that it would build its own, rather extravagant, line.  In 1925, construction had begun and wouldn't be complete until 1933 due to its complicated design which included [[w:flying junctions|flying junctions]] and a highly integrated system.  These costs would triple the amount of debt held by the government: the project cost $191 million and was entirely financed by the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Crowell | first = Paul | title = Gay Midnight Crowds Rides First Trains in New Subway | newspaper = The New York Times | location = New York| date = 10 September 1932 | url = http://www.nycsubway.org/articles/nytimes-1932-indopen.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost on cue, the Great Depression eliminates any chance the IND line had on making profits, to which by 1940 the IRT and BMT were bought out by the municipal government.  Neither the IRT or the BMT could cope with both the loss in ridership and the inability to change the fare price.  Within 30 years, the subway industry that began from a $30 million project, garnered over $347 million in investments

While the IND was able to come to fruition, a subway running on what was the 2nd Avenue elevated rail line never came to fruition.  Yet, because of its continued stay in the limelight, 70 years after it had been proposed, the [[w:Second Avenue Subway|Second Avenue Subway]] has begun construction in 2010.  In many ways, the line came to symbolize how people viewed the subway system in New York City: a project that was never finished.  Even so, people are skeptical about whether it is absolutely necessary in what is already the largest subway network in the world; in a lot of ways the system won't be adding something as monumental as the IND line or the lines made during the Dual Contract phase.  Yet after all the cuts the system had to make in the post War period, in the dog days of the 70's and 80's for the New York City subways were crime and graffiti were rampant, people are looking for hope that once again the New York City subway system is going through a regrowth phase, starting with the Second Avenue subway.

      <text xml:space="preserve">TOR only published instructions for the [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxy VPN mode in Linux ], which is called transparent proxy, routing all network traffic via TOR transparently.

It is not advised to use Vidalia as it does not have sufficient system privileged by default.  First install TOR use one of the several distribution specific ways.  By default, TOR runs as daemon and have root privilege. 

In Ubuntu for example, add the following lines to /etc/tor/torrc:

:VirtualAddrNetwork 10.192.0.0/10
:AutomapHostsOnResolve 1
:TransPort 9040
:DNSPort 53

This will instruct TOR to forward redirected traffic at port 9040, and forward domain name server requests at port 53.  TOR will fail if it has insufficient privilege for the DNS port.  You can use any existing DNS server by omitting the DNSPort line, but this is not as secure as TOR.

To redirect all the applications' network traffic, there is the Linux firewall iptables:

:sudo iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m owner --uid-owner bob -m tcp -j REDIRECT --to-ports 9040
:sudo iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p udp -m owner --uid-owner bob -m udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 53
:sudo iptables -t filter -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m owner --uid-owner bob -m tcp --dport 9040 -j ACCEPT
:sudo iptables -t filter -A OUTPUT -p udp -m owner --uid-owner bob -m udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT
:sudo iptables -t filter -A OUTPUT -m owner --uid-owner bob -j DROP

This will work unless you have a very old Linux distribution.  Only the first command is necessary to test the VPN functionality, redirecting all network traffic to port 9040, where TOR is listening.  The redirection ONLY applies to user named bob.  Once redirected, you need to restart TOR:
:/etc/init.d/tor restart
You can then login in as bob and fire up the browser for example, and check your external IP at any of the many proxy test sites.

User bob can be yourself.  In this case you need to reset iptables to the previous state when you don't need TOR VPN.  The other way is to login in as a different user whenever you need TOR VPN, where the redirection is setup to be &quot;permanent&quot;.

Redirection of DNS port 53 is optional, but more secure.  Even observers at your ISP will not know what websites you visited.  The other firewall rules block other traffic to prevent leaking.

The rules can be stored in a shell script and executed whenever TOR VPN is needed.  The default firewall rules will apply after system reboot.  To setup a user with TOR VPN always on, copy the above script to (for Ubuntu):
:/etc/init.d/bobsvpn

To further prevent DNS leak, in Ubuntu, you need to change the file content at /etc/resolvconf/run/resovl.conf to
:nameserver 127.0.0.1
This will force ALL users to use TOR as the DNS server. After changing network settings, sometimes you need to refresh the network interface:
:sudo ifdown -a
:sudo ifup -a
Naturally TOR DNS will be slower and you will want to keep the original resolv.conf file when not using TOR.

The firewall rules cannot be undone directly.  To avoid system reboot, you can store the firewall state before using TOR:
:sudo iptables-save &gt; rulefile
and restore the rules after using TOR:
:sudo iptables-restore &lt; rulefile

It is possible to grant priviledge to users who cannot become superuser, and to grant scripts superuser privilege without asking for password.  You can only edit the config file by:
:sudo visudo
If you make any mistakes, you may have to reboot in recovery mode, as root, to correct it.  Safe scripts can be given the permission not to ask for su password by adding the line:
:bob ALL = NOPASSWD:/home/bob/bin/scriptX, /usr/bin/scriptY

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The United States Post Office (USPS) services 151 million delivery points in the United States. &lt;ref name=“USPSDeliveries”&gt;{{cite web |url=http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/delivery-points-1905-2010.htm |title=Delivery Points, 1905 to 2010, in Millions |month=January |year=2011 |publisher=Historian, United States Postal Service |accessdate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This network of mailboxes, post offices, sorting facilities, and delivery trucks provides the means for any individual or business to ship goods or information from one destination to another. As electronic means of transmitting information increase in availability and decrease in cost, it is reasonable to expect that this physical postal network will decline in relevance over time.  This article examines historical data on the number of post offices in the United States and the volume of mail handled by the post office to identify a birth, growth, maturity, and decline lifecycle for the postal service mode of transport.

===Postal Service as a transportation mode===
Centralized postal service is a coordinated transport system that physically moves goods and information between destinations.  It is essentially a freight system that is accessible to any individual or business. 

Monopoly and service obligation

====Sub-modes: Post offices vs. home delivery====
The postal service's deployment model originally was a network of post offices and transshipment in between them.  Post office customers were responsible for bringing mail to the post office and for picking up their letters and parcels from general delivery to their local post office.

In the 1860's, the postal service started to deploy home/business delivery within urbanized areas. This enabled the closing of post offices, as there was less demand for customer assistance in the post office. Each post office as able to serve a larger area and population base because a network of carriers was deployed to distribute the mail to people's homes and offices.

In the 1890's, the post office began to experiment with rural home delivery to see if it would be feasible. By 1901, rural home delivery was the postal service's official policy.  At this point, the number of post offices in the United States began to contract as larger and larger portions of the country were connected to this home delivery network.

This shift from an exclusively post office-oriented network to an expanded point-to-point network connecting all residents is essentially a mode shift within the postal system.  It altered the primary role post offices played in the system, shifting their role from a public face and a distribution point to a logistics center coordinating postal carriers,  The average number of people to post office continued to increase with population growth and post office consolidation.

===Enabling modes===
Postal service evolved over time to incorporate technological advancements.  What started as a horse and carriage operation incorporated river boats, railroads, highways, and eventually air freight.  

===Competing modes===
Technological advancements in information technology are supplanting much of the postal service's information-transporting function. The number of pieces of mail handled each year started declining in 2006. When averaged across the population, the number of pieces of mail handled per person has been in decline since 2000.

==Results==
===Descriptive Statistics===
As evident in the Descriptive Statistics table, both the number of post offices and the volume of mail handled have already peaked.  Post offices peaked in 1901 when USPS made rural home delivery standard practice.  Volume of mail peaked more recently in 2006.  Post offices per 10,000 people was highly volatile in the 1800's as USPS rolled out home delivery incrementally.

[[File:Descriptive Statistics Population &amp; USPS Data.png|650px|Descriptive statistics for population, mail handled, post offices, and constructed variables]]

Notably, both mail handled per person and post offices per 10,000 people peaked before the absolute measures of mail handled and post offices.  Even before the rural home delivery policy in 1901 that precipitated the closure of many post offices, fewer post offices were needed to serve the same number of people.  This could be explained by urban home delivery, increased efficiency of operations, or better supporting transportation infrastructure.  Mail volumes per person peaked in 2000 and has been declining.  This can reasonably be explained by shifting information technologies and the rise of electronic transmission supplanting physical print material delivery.

===Correlations===
All of the variables presented in the Dependent Variable Correlations table have a statistically significant correlation with year, population, and transformed population.  The direction of these correlations is not unexpected: mail volume has increased dramatically over time and with increasing population, while the number of post offices has declined.  The average number of people each post office serves is positively correlated with population both due to the declining number of post offices and the ever-increasing population.  

[[File:Dependent Variable Correlations.png|400px|Correlations between absolute dependent variables, transformed dependent variables, and independent variables (year, absolute population, transformed population)]]

===Regression Models===

====Pieces of mail handled over time====
[[File:Mail Volumes Actual and Projected.png|thumb|upright=2]]
The mail volumes over time models demonstrate the significance of a growing market in the deployment of this particular transportation &quot;mode&quot;.  While mail volume has a strong and statistically significant coefficient in Models 1 and 1a, controlling for population in Model 2a eliminates the effect of time.  Model 2a fits the growth phase of these data quite well, with an &lt;math&gt;R^2&lt;/math&gt; value of 0.977.  &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; values for Model 1 and Model 1a are reasonable given the parameters of the data and the qualitative history of USPS and competing modes.

[[File:Regression Mail volumes over time.png|x150px]]

Since the peak volumes of mail handled occurred in 2006, there were not enough data points to conduct a meaningful analysis of the decay phase while controlling for population.  Even though Model 1b has t statistic values with a magnitude greater than 2, this model should be considered with caution because it only contains 4 years of data.  Conversely, since the decay phase is only evident in the final 4 years of data, the overall models (Model 1 and Model 2) fit the data almost as well as the growth-specific models (Model 1a and Model 2a).

The &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; value for Model 1b reinforces the decay model's weakness: 2010 is the final year of available data, so it is unreasonable to expect with any certainty that 2010 will indeed be the inflection point on the decay curve.  The decay model assumes that mail volumes will ultimately drop to zero as other modes replace it quickly, while it is easy to imagine the postal service retaining modest importance as other modes slowly substitute in.

====Number of post offices over time====
Unlike the mail volumes model, post offices peaked in 1901 and the overall models are not a very good fit for the data, with &lt;math&gt;R^2&lt;/math&gt; values below 0.355.  The coefficients are not consistent with our knowledge of the post office trends: Models 1 and 2 have positive coefficients for time, when it is evident from the graph in the descriptive statistics that the number of post offices has been in decline for over a century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Descriptives&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Descriptive_Statistics_Population_%26_USPS_Data.png |author=J. E. Schoner |title=Descriptive Statistics |month=October |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Regression Post offices over time.png|x150px]]

Both the growth and decay models fit the data much better than the overall models.  The coefficients in Models 1a and 1b are consistent with the expected direction of influence and have strong t-statistics.  Controlling for population in Models 2a and 2b strengthens the coefficients for time, and they remain statistically significant.  Controlling for population also improves the model fit slightly for both the growth and decay phases.

While the decay model failed for mail volumes, the decay model for post offices uses a much longer trajectory of data and is consistent with the slow fizzle of post office coverage over time, rather than the precipitous drop the mail volume model predicted.

The &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; values for Models 1a and 1b are reasonable given the parameters of the data.

====Number of post offices abandoned or closed over time====
[[File:Post Office Decay Models Curve Types.png|thumb|upright=2]]
[[File:Post Office Decay Models Actual vs. Projected.png|thumb|upright=2]]

These data only required Models 1b and 2b because post office closure did not start until after the number of post offices peaked in 1901.  

[[File:Regression Post offices closed or abandoned over time.png|x150px]]

This model fits the post office data much better than simply the number of post offices from 1901 to 2010.  Model 1b has &lt;math&gt;R^2&lt;/math&gt; values of 0.941 for the post office closure data and 0.747 for the number of post offices data.  Model 2b has &lt;math&gt;R^2&lt;/math&gt; values of 0.965 for the post office closure data, again compared to 0.790 for the number of post offices.

As apparent in the Curve Types image to the left, when transformed and adjusted to the same scale, the closed/abandoned curve more closely resembles the S-Curve function we are using to predict the birth, growth, and maturity cycle.  The curve representing the actual number of post offices remaining is the inverse of this graph, with steep changes occurring while the closed/abandoned curve is in the more gradual birth and maturity phases.  The next image plots these data alongside the projected values using the regression coefficient and calculated &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; from Model 1b.


====Ratios of volumes and facilities to population models====
The final three dependent variables tested are all ratios of mail volumes or post office facilities to total population, so Models 2, 2a, and 2b controlling for population have been eliminated.

=====Post offices per 10,000 people=====
[[File:Regression Post offices per 10,000 people over time.png|x120px]]

=====People per post office=====
[[File:Regression People per post office over time.png|x120px]]

=====Mail volumes per person=====
[[File:Regression Mail volumes per person over time.png|x120px]]


==Discussion==
These experiments suggest that while the S-Curve model of predicting transportation mode deployment as a function of time fits relatively well, population growth is also a significant driver of deployment.  Controlling for population directly through the regression model or indirectly by testing the rate of mail volumes or post office facilities to population facilitated in isolating the effects of population versus time.  

The post office facility models best demonstrated the S-curve deployment pattern.  The growth models for &lt;math&gt;T &lt; 1901&lt;/math&gt; for number of post offices had high &lt;math&gt;R^2&lt;/math&gt; values.  Controlling for population increased the strength of the regression coefficient and the &lt;math&gt;R^2&lt;/math&gt; value.  The decay model for closure/abandonment of post office facilities best modeled the shift to home delivery and then technological mode shift.  Controlling for population decreased the regression coefficient but still improved the &lt;math&gt;R^2&lt;/math&gt; value.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Rail was the primary mode of mass transit and commercial transportation in the United States in the mid-19th century and reached peak usage in the early 20th century.   The first iteration of American railroads was the early tramways in New England in the early 19th century.  This system was mostly used for industrial purposes and did not carry human passengers.  Early tramways featured freight cars on inclined grades that were moved by horses as part of a cable system.  The tramways were located around quarries, mines, and factories to haul minerals, lumber, coal, and other goods.  Payloads were moved along tracks called gangways by horses and in later years by precursors to the locomotive.  Technological innovations to the locomotive increased the load volume each car carried and the rise in speed due to improvements in steam engine technology shortened the travel time from origin to destination.  Additional backing from municipal and state governments in the mid-19th century focused toward promoting the expansion of rail networks and tended to eliminate funding for canals.   

==Main Advantages of Rail==

Rail held several improvements over canals:
	
* Railroads provided more options for direct routes to urban areas and markets than canals 
* Railroads were available for service throughout the year compared to canals  
* Winters were especially difficult on canals in the northern United States 
* Railroads carried more tonnage as the technology matured   
* Improvements to existing canal networks were marginal 
* The widespread adoption of railroads improved existing technologies 

==Primary Markets==
The primary markets for rail were ports and industrial centers that gave entrepreneurs greater access to natural resources.  Business owners embraced the ability of railroads to carry raw goods more quickly than canals to processing centers, refineries, and other finishing shops.  As the rail network expanded the business of rail became lucrative.  Cornelius Vanderbilt began buying railroad lines in 1862 after he sold his steamboat business.  John I. Blair constructed network of railroads throughout the Midwest, including the Union Pacific, which served as an important section of the transcontinental railway line.  These two men are among the wealthiest citizens in United States history.  &lt;ref&gt;The New York Times. &quot;The Wealthiest Americans Ever.&quot; 15 July 2007. New York Times. 1 October 2011 &lt;http://www.nytimes.com/ref/business/20070715_GILDED_GRAPHIC.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth of American Railroads==
The rail network in the United States was expanding in the late 19th century because the innovation of streetcars and heavy rail was superior to canals.  The canal system began as a means to expand the enterprise of the gentry in early colonial America.  When remarking on a proposed canal from Philadelphia to the Ohio River during a legislative session in 1790 the Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Thomas Mifflin, noted that route was “’a natural avenue from the shores of the Atlantic to the vast regions of the western territory,’ connecting ‘the extreme members of the union,’ and offering rewards beyond imagination.”&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Ronald E. Canals For A Nation: The Canal Era in the United States 1790-1860. Lexington: The University Press of Kentucky, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  The early canals were mismanaged and routinely ran out of funding before projects were completed.  

The Industrial Revolution brought the use of machinery into American commerce.  Investors wanted improvements in cargo volume and lower travel time from factory to market for their goods.  Modern factories of the time reduced production time for many goods and made workers more productive.  With more goods available for sale due to the innovations of the Industrial Revolution businesspersons looked to expand the scope of their market segments.  Improvements to the steam engine enabled capitalists to broaden the areas that they were able to sell their products.  Canals were effective for simple fur traders and for small agrarian areas but did not have the capacity that the growing industrial movement required for their businesses to grow.  Railroads filled this market niche and would later become the supreme transportation mode in the United States.

Railroads surpassed canals as the major transit choice for long distance travel though there was initial opposition.  Towns and canal owners resisted the new locomotive technology deeming it unsafe for widespread use.  Proponents of railroads included corporations that were looking to build economies of scale and towns that were in favor of the connections to order industrialized areas

==Growth of the Railroad==
The beginning of the second half of the 19th century marked a boom period for rail construction in the United States.  Track designers and railway entrepreneurs sought capital infrastructure investments from banks and other financiers.  Railroads became the first means of mass transportation.  By the 1850s there were large numbers of people travelling throughout the eastern United States.  The railroads may be considered the first instruments that produced a recognizable American character and society.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, Rudolph. Trains Across The Continent: North American Railroad History. 2nd edition. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;



During the growth phase of the American railroad network there is a clear delineation before and after the Civil War in terms of the total amount of track.  The antebellum period from 1830-1859 was a time when the build out phase of railroads began to spread across the country.  The average volume of track in a given year in the United States was 13,015 kilometers.  The Civil War years may have affected railroad expansion considering the total volume of track was roughly the same from 1861-1865 with an average of 53,311 kilometers. From 1866-1877 the average volume of track rose to 96,388 kilometers.  

Figure 2 shows the annual increase in track volume.  There is a low amount of annual construction from 1830 to 1848.  From 1849-1856 there is a surge of railroad construction peaking in 1856 with an increase of 5,896 kilometers over the previous year.  There is a drop in rail construction through the end of the Civil War in 1864.  From 1865 through 1871 there is a large spike in rail construction each year with the zenith in 1871 when 12,243 kilometers of new rail was built.  Annual rail construction fell 75% overall from 1872 through 1877.

[[File:PA5232Figure2.png|500px|thumb|none|Figure 2&lt;ref name=&quot;The American News Company&quot; /&gt;]]

Before the Civil War there was an average of 1551 kilometers per year of railroad construction.   The post-Civil War average was 5917 kilometers per year.  This figure represents a 281% increase.  Figure 3 is instructive of the growth period for the American railroad network.  From 1880-1890 the US Census reports an increase of 73% in the number of locomotives in operation.  Freight locomotives increased by 69% and passenger locomotives rose by 80%.  White discovered that the bonded debt of American railroads rose from $416 million in 1867 to $2.23 billion in 1874 and $5.055 billion in 1890.  Most of the funds were delivered through domestic investors but there was increasing investment from entities in Great Britain, Germany, and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;White, Richard. &quot;Information, Markets, and Corruption: Transcontinental Railroads in the Guilded Age.&quot; The Journal of American History 90.1 (2003): 19-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Report on Transportation Business in The United States at the Eleventh Census: 1890, Part I.-Transportation by Land. Part I. United States Department of the Interior. Washington: Government Printing Office, 1895.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Mature Phase==
Near the end of the 19th century arguments were made for the nationalization of railroads due to economic reasons.  The rationale was that a fully developed railroad system was essential to the future success of the United States.  Improvements in the East would lead to control the food supply of the world as a result of the reduction of carriage on wheat and corn from Chicago to New York.  That reduction would enable domestic producers of grains and various goods to undersell Russia in Europe while wheat farmers in the Dakotas and Minnesota would see a rebirth in demand for their exports.&lt;ref&gt;Latcha, J. A. &quot;Railroads versus Canals.&quot; The North American Review 1 February 1898: 207-225.&lt;/ref&gt;  Figure 4 shows the continued expansion of the American railroad network though nationalization of passenger rail would not occur until well into the 20th century.  The expansion peaked in 1916 with a total of 409,177 kilometers of railroad track in the United States.  After 1916 the volume of rail slowly declines during the Great Depression era and the decline picks up steam as the United States approaches World War 2. 

[[File:PA5232Figure4.png|500px|thumb|none|Figure 4&lt;ref name=&quot;The Bureau of the Census&quot;&gt;The Bureau of the Census. Historical Statistics of the United States 1789-1945. Washington: United States Department of Commerce, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Figure 5 shows the annual change in track volume from 1890 through 1945.  There is a sharp drop in annual track construction beginning in 1906.  Railroads were becoming phased out in favor of automobiles as there is hardly any new rail construction after 1917. The period between the two world wars shows the outright elimination of rail or the addition of only several hundred kilometers per year.  Each year after 1930 confirms a negative change in track volume.

[[File:PA5232Figure5.png|500px|thumb|none|Figure 5&lt;ref name=&quot;The Bureau of the Census&quot; /&gt;]]

Evidence for the decline of railroads in the United States can be found by studying the number of railways in operation.  The number of railways grows from 1890-1907 reaching a maximum of 1,564.   The total number of railways in operation in 1945 fell to 517; a 67% decline.

[[File:PA5232Figure6.png|500px|thumb|none|Figure 6&lt;ref name=&quot;The Bureau of the Census&quot; /&gt;]]

==Conclusion==
The railroad network in the United States is not as prominent in the early 21st century as it was in the same period of the 20th century.  Changes in American lifestyle such as the dominance of the automobile and the adoption of the Interstate Highway Act of 1956 continued to linger over the railroad industry.  High-speed rail (HSR) may be a mode that will emerge into national prominence.  Federal spending must increase for this to occur because state and municipal governments do not have funding capabilities for HSR projects on their own.

The personally owned automobile has become a symbol of power, convenience, and economic well being in the industrialized world since its creation. Despite its popularity, growing environmental concerns over automobiles and their reliance on internal combustion engine (ICE) platforms has provoked researchers and manufacturers alike, to seek alternatives modes of transport.  One alternative, the hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), has garnered notable support in the United States since being first introduced in 1999 (Heffner et al, 2005).  

HEVs differ from conventional vehicles by utilizing a combination of electric and ICE components.  More specifically, HEVs use batteries, electric motors, regenerative breaking and reduction of engine idling time to enhance a conventional internal combustion engine (Reynold and Kandlikar 2007).  The parallel use of conventional and alternative technologies utilized in HEVs make them fuel efficient and desirable for those consumers seeking an environmentally friendly vehicle.   When compared to conventional vehicles, HEVs have lower emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases (Bitsche and Gutmann, 2004).  

The perceived positive environmental impact of owning a HEV has created a growing consumer market in the United States (Heffner et al, 2005).  How large this market becomes is a point of significant debate within the automobile industry (Keefe et al 2008).   By looking at the annual new HEV sales in America, a clear life cycle of birth, growth, and maturation emerges.  Unless significant changes are made in what is currently the period of maturation for this mode, HEVs will remain a niche vehicle, eclipsed by the conventional automobile.

== Calculations ==
===Sales Data===
The annual new HEV sales and total passenger vehicle sales data for the United States was obtained from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) and is depicted below in Table and Figure 1.   

[[File:Total_Passenger_Vehicle_&amp;_HEV_Sales_in_the_United_States_(1999-2009).jpg‎|500px|thumb|none|Table 1: Total Passenger Vehicle &amp; HEV Sales in the United States  (1999-2009)]]

[[File:Passenger Vehicle &amp; HEV Sales in the United States (1999-2009).jpg|500px|thumb|none|Figure 1:  Total Passenger Vehicle &amp; HEV Sales in the United States  (1999-2009)]]

The substantial growth of HEV sales at the turn of the 21st century lead some experts to predict that HEV would capture 4% of the total vehicle market by 2012 (Haan et al, 2006).  However, current trending solidifies the belief the HEV's market share is minuscule when compared to the total vehicle sold in the United States (Jones, 2003).

===Saturation Calculations===
Proceeding calculations adapted from Levinson UM Twin Cities PA 5232 Assignment.

The data obtained from the BTS was utilized to estimate a three-parameter logistic function of the form:

S(t) = K/[1+exp(-b(t-to)] , where S(t) is the predicted number of HEV sales .

In the equation, K represents the saturation point (maturity in the life cycle).  To determine which value of K would best fit the S-curve of HEV’s life cycle, the following formula was used:

Y = LN(Sales/(K - Sales)), where “Sales” is the data represented in column 3 of Table 1.

[[File:Table 2 Calculation for Regression-predicted HEV Sales.jpg|500px|thumb|none|Table 2:  Calculation for regression-Predicted HEV Sales]]

{{BookCat}}
The K estimates displayed in Table 2 were inputted into the StatPlus regression analysis tool for Microsoft Excel to determine the slope (b) and tnought (to) for the equation: 

S(t) = K/[1+exp(-b(t-to)].

==Before the Modern HEV==
The United States has a storied transportation history that has significantly shaped the urban and rural landscapes of today.  Today’s American urban centers offer a variety of bus, rail, and air travel services for its travelers.  However, the extent to which public transportation systems are available varies drastically throughout the United States.   As a result, many Americans rely on the internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) and the nation's mature road infrastructure for their transportation needs.  The demand for this travel mode is substantial:  roughly 17 million 'light-duty' vehicles are sold annually in the United States (Keefe et al, 2008). 

The conventional ICEV is powered by the burning of fuel to create the energy needed to propel the car forward (Reynolds and Kandikar, 2007).  This process is hardly efficient:  only 15% of the energy burned is used for moving the vehicle forward, the rest is lost in idling and engine inefficiencies (Berensteanu and Li, 2011).  The environmental ramifications associated with ICEVs range from carbon dioxide emissions to a greater dependence on foreign oil imports (Demirdoven and Deutch, 2004).

The excessive inefficiencies in fuel consumption and energy transfer has created a demand for an alternative energy platform to propel the automobile into the future.  However, one only needs to look to the past for inspiration for alternative vehicle platforms.  The electric vehicle (EV) was invented in 1834 and was widely deployed throughout England, America, and France by the late 1800s (Chan et al, 2002).  However, with the birth of the ICEV and its extended range and dependability, EVs largely disappeared as a mode of transport by the 1830s (Chan et al, 2002).  But, with renewed vigor towards producing more efficient vehicles, EVs were redeployed to the American market again in the mid-to-late 1990s (Jones, 2003).  However, the historical range and dependability limitations of the EV continue to plague its use in the automobile market.

==Birth of the Today's HEV, 1999-2003==
===Invention===
Despite the EV's failure to capture a large consumer base, manufacturers were determined to offer a technologically advanced yet fuel-efficient vehicle.  This determination led to the creation of the modern HEV.  It is important to note, that like EV technologies, the concept and creation HEV automobiles has been around since the late 19th century.  In addition, HEV technologies have been utilized by varying degrees via public bus services throughout the past century.  But for the purposes of this project, the author's reference to HEV is directed to the privately owned and operated, modern HEV.  

HEVs vary from EV and ICEV technologies by utilizing a rechargeable battery that captures energy loss typical in ICEVs and provides that energy for propulsion whenever the ICE proves to be inefficient (Beresteanu and Li, 2011).  While in motion, the ICE recharges the car's battery, successfully extending its range while maintaining fuel efficiency (Demirdoven and Deutch, 2004).  The hybrid motor's ability to alternate between the ICE and the electric motor, creates an operating sweet spot that cuts emissions while maintaining fuel efficiencies (Jones, 2003).  

The HEV's batteries are the key technological component and are essential for the HEVs long term success  (Chalk et al, 2006).  The way in which the ICE and the battery system is arranged within the vehicle platform can be broken into four categories. According to Chan et al:

*Series Hybrid System:  Simplest of the four and generally the least efficient.  ICE mechanical output is converted into electricity using a generator (2002).
*Parallel Hybrid System:  Allows the ICE and the electric motor to deliver power together or individually to propel the vehicle forward (2002).
**Parallel hybrid systems are the most common and cost-efficient of the HEV arrangements (Bitsche and Gutmann, 2004).
*Series-Parallel Hybrid System:  Combination of the Series and Parallel systems with an added mechanical link (2002).
*Complex Hybrid System:  More complex then the other three systems and is characterized by the bidirectional power flow of the electric motor (2002).

===Early Markets===
The first successful mass produced HEV in the world, the Toyota Prius, was first deployed in  Japan in 1997 (Jones, 2003).  Two years later, the Honda Insight became the first HEV sold in America.  That subsequent year, the first shipments of the Toyota Prius arrived in limited quantities to the United States (See Table 1 &amp; Table 7).  The limited production runs of these HEVs did not deter consumer interest.  In particular, the Prius developed a culture niche by offering early consumers the ability to 'make a statement' of social responsibility and healthy living via their ownership of the vehicle (Heffner et al, 2005).   Despite its increase in pop culture identification, by the turn of the 21st century, consumers remained limited on their HEV model options.  From 2000 to 2003, only two vehicles, the Toyota Prius and the Honda Insight, were offered for sale in the United States (Reynolds and Kandikar, 2007).

===Role of Policy===
Despite the environmental and fuel efficiency advantages offered by the mode, the HEV market had two notable challenges to overcome.  First, the cost of the HEV is more expensive than ICEVs of comparable size and class.  Secondly, a pattern of slow growth is typically observed when new technologies are introduced into a mature system.  Thus, consumer confidence was needed to spur the growth of HEV sales in America.  Starting in 2000, federal, state, and local governments implemented a wide set of incentives used to offset the higher cost of the HEV and instill consumer confidence in the new technology (Keefe et al , 2008).  Although the incentives were generous, they did not fully offset the cost of the price differential between HEVs and ICEVs of comparable size and class.  

The federal government incentive for encouraging HEV purchases was in the form of a tax deduction.  Starting with the Honda Insight, the government offered a $2,000 tax deduction for any newly purchased HEV (Beresteanu and Li, 2011).  This incentive would stand until being converted into a tax credit under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Ghallagher and Muehlegger, 2007).

State purchase incentives varied in generosity, duration,  and creativity.  Ghallagher and Muehlegger observed that:

*Nine states offered single rider occupant access to HOV lanes during peak traffic hours (2007)
*Eight states offered their own income tax credits of varying amounts (2007).
*Four states offered registration, excise tax exemption, or rebate (2007).  
*Numerous major metropolitan areas offered parking fee reductions or exemptions (2007).

==Growth of the HEV, 2003-2007==
With the aid in consumer confidence, purchasing incentives, and overall popularity, HEV sales continued to rise in America.  To meet that growing demand and to capture a larger market, auto manufacturers began diversifying their product lines.  Ford expanded the HEV market by introducing the first SUV in 2004 and brought the total number HEV models for sale in the United States to four (Keefe et al (2008).  In subsequent years, six more models from added to the market.  By 2007, a total fifteen HEV models from manufacturers ranging from Saturn to Lexus were available on the U.S. market (Bernesteanu and Li, 2011).  This substantial growth caused some analysts to predict that the total HEV market share of the passenger vehicles would top 4% by 2012 (Haan et al, 2006).

Federal, state, and local incentives continued but with some notable changes.  

In 2006, the federal income tax deduction of $2,000 was converted into a tax credit of up to $3,400 for HEVs purchased after December 31, 2005 (Beresteanu and Li, 2011).  This tax credit varied upon model, fuel efficiency, and the number of vehicles sold by the manufacturer (Beresteanu and Li, 2011).  Additionally, on a case-by-case basis, state and local HEV incentives were assessed, discontinued, or improved during the time. These fiscal incentives and regulatory pressures continued to spur HEV market growth (Keefe et al, 2008).  

The federal, state, and local incentives were not the only fiscal influence that spurred HEV growth, from 2003-2007, gas prices rose considerably in the United States.  Gallagher and Muehlegger suggest that high gas prices played a larger role in HEV purchases then the state and federal incentives did (2007).  Beresteanu and Li go further by hypothesizing that without the increase in gas prices witnessed during this period, that HEV purchases would have been reduced by nearly one-third in their case study area (2011).

==Maturation of the HEV, 2007-present==
The HEV market in the United States is the largest in the world with cumulative sales topping two million units.  Despite the impressive growth over the past decade, the HEV market remains a niche that has fully matured.  Despite diversifying the number of HEV models to dozens of models,  consumers are  not adopting this mode at the rates that experts were hoping for.  According to researchers, HEVs cost too much to be worth the initial investment (Lave and MacLean, 2001).  Others suggest that barring the invention of a more cost efficient battery (Chan et al, 2002) or a more lucrative federal rebate program (Beresteanu and Li, 2011), HEV sales will not reach the levels once predicted.  

The author maintains that HEVs sales will continue to mature and decline for the following reasons:

*ICEVs are becoming more fuel efficient and as a result, are becoming more attractive to fuel conscious consumers.
*The initial capital investment is not recouped over the span of ownership.
*Reliability and maintenance concerns continue to deter buyers.
*Gas prices have continued to lower since 2007.

==Introduction to Streetcars==
Three different technologies were used by street railways in the Twin Cities between 1872 and 1954: horsecars, cable cars, and electric streetcars. The power was the biggest difference between these three; otherwise they were relatively similar technologies. The street railways in the Twin Cities ran on standard gauge (1435mm) rails. Some of the suburban lines ran on ballasted rails on private right of way, but for the most part the streetcars operated on embedded rails in mixed traffic. Electric power was generated at several steam and hydroelectric power plants in Minneapolis and Saint Paul. Several small substations converted the electricity to 600 V DC&lt;ref name=diers&gt;Diers, J. and Isaacs, A. (2007). Twin Cities by trolley: the streetcar era in Minneapolis
and St. Paul. Univ Of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; that was used to power the cars via overhead catenary. 

For passengers, the advantages of streetcars were the speed of travel, low cost, and the number of destinations available. From the perspective of the operating company, the advantages were the efficiency of vehicles on fixed rails and the ability to operate on schedule despite muddy streets and winter weather. 

The main market was the working classes. The rich have always had transportation choices, from horses and carriages in the early years to automobiles later on. The working classes could not afford these options and did not purchase automobiles en masse until after World War I. Streetcars provided frequent service throughout the day and were used for both work and shopping trips. Twin City Rapid Transit (TCRT) actively developed a market for leisure trips to resorts out in the country and profited from special event services to downtown nightlife, sports games, and the Minnesota State Fair.

==Before Streetcars==
At least in the Twin Cities, not much existed before the first horsecar line developed in 1872. At the 1870 Census, Minneapolis (including the City of Saint Anthony, with which it merged in 1872&lt;ref name=kieffer&gt;Kieffer, S. (1958). Transit and the Twins: A Survey of the History of the Transportation Company in Minneapolis and Saint Paul: an Analysis of the Role of Public Transportation
in the Growth of the Twin Cities. Twin City Rapid Transit Co.(Minneapolis).&lt;/ref&gt;) had a population of 18,079 and Saint Paul had a population of 20,030. Minneapolis and Saint Anthony had only been incorporated since 1858, and Saint Paul had been incorporated since 1849. The Mississippi River was the primary means of transportation at this time, and it was very effective at bringing settlers to Minnesota as well as carrying furs, lumber, and flour away. However, navigation was difficult above the confluence with the Minnesota River, short of Minneapolis, and the river was not a practical solution for intracity travel. A few people might have used horses and carriages to get around town, but most people just walked everywhere. This limited the size of both cities, since workers needed to locate within a reasonable walking distance of their jobs.

The first rail line, the Chicago and Rock Island, was built into the area in 1854. The first line connecting Saint Paul to Minneapolis, the Minnesota and Pacific, was completed in 1862&lt;ref name=kieffer /&gt;. At this point, it would have been possible to travel from Minneapolis to Saint Paul by train, but the line was built with freight opportunities in mind. This connection encouraged the cities to grow toward each other and sparked the development of Minneapolis as a milling center. These developments, as well as the rapid growth of the Minneapolis-St. Paul area from a couple thousand settlers in 1850 to about 40,000 people in 1870, encouraged local politicians and business leaders to plan for future growth. Saint Paul granted its first horsecar franchise to a group of businessmen in 1866, and Minneapolis did the same in 1867 although neither started operation right away&lt;ref name=kieffer /&gt;. On July 15, 1872, the opening day for Saint Paul's first horsecar line, the Saint Paul Pioneer wrote that the city &quot;has seen the necessity of streetcars to reduce its length and breadth of 'magnificent distances.'&quot;&lt;ref name=kieffer /&gt; This quote reflects the realization that both cities needed a faster mode of intraurban transportation in order to expand beyond what have become their central business districts today.

==Invention of Streetcar Technology==
Streetcar service began in 1872 with horsecars. By this point, horsecars were a mature technology, having started in New York in 1831.&lt;ref name=diers /&gt; They were a hybrid of other technologies, using the horses that were already owned to pull stagecoaches and omnibuses but running on rails instead of a carriage base for a smoother ride. Horsecars in the Twin Cities ran on tracks fashioned out of iron straps attached to wooden stringers,&lt;ref name=diers /&gt; usually at a narrow gauge of 1067mm. This led to economies of scale later on since these rails were being produced in massive quantities. The cars themselves were 3 meters long and the driver sat outside on a platform. The passenger compartment had straw on the floor and a small stove, but was notoriously cold in winter.&lt;ref name=kieffer /&gt; Cars frequently derailed due to the track conditions. Additionally, the use of horses caused problems. They were expensive to care for, had to be switched out after 4-5 hours due to fatigue, left manure on the streets, and had to be replaced when they died from disease or old age.

Although steam power was used on mainline railroads at this time, it was considered undesirable for use on street railways due to the noise, soot, and potential to spook horses. Nevertheless, the Minneapolis, Lyndale, and Lake Calhoun Railway built a steam powered line from downtown Minneapolis to Lake Calhoun in 1879, which was later extended to Lake Minnetonka. The steam engine was enclosed in a box in an attempt to address concerns, but it was still disliked and the steam trains were retired in 1890. (The line itself was taken over by the Minneapolis Street Railway Company in 1887.)&lt;ref name=kieffer /&gt; 

The next technology to enter the market was cable cars. Cable car technology was invented in California for use in gold mines and was first applied to street railways in San Francisco in 1873.&lt;ref name=diers /&gt; Downtown Saint Paul is in a low-lying area surrounded by hills. Many of these were too steep for horsecars, so the first cable route was built in 1887 up Selby hill.&lt;ref name=kieffer /&gt; Another line was built on E 7th Street in 1889. Most of these lines were removed a few years later, although the section up Selby hill stayed until a tunnel was complete in 1906. Cable cars were powered by a central power plant and could climb steep hills, but had a number of disadvantages as well. The cable ran in a slot below the tracks and cars could grip or release the constantly running cable to control speed. Although having one central power plant was good for efficiency, one cable break or a problem at the power plant would shut the whole line down. There were problems with snow and ice getting into the cable trench, and the cable cars were not very fast.

Electric power was the next advancement, and it went through several revisions before it was implemented in the Twin Cities. Ernst Werner von Siemens presented a third-rail powered locomotive in 1879 in Berlin. This was a successful technology, and third-rail power is used today in subway systems around the world. However, it was unsuitable for streetcars due to the danger to horses and pedestrians.&lt;ref name=crosby&gt;Crosby, O. and Bell, L. (1893). The electric railway in theory and practice. WJ Johnston
Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Van Depoele in Minneapolis, and others around the country, tested electric cars with overhead power in the 1880s. None of these were very successful until Frank Sprague solved both the power collection and electric motor questions in 1885. His design collected power from a single overhead wire and transmitted the power from the motor to the axle through gears and bearings (as opposed to belts and chains, which were prone to breaking).&lt;ref name=diers /&gt;&lt;ref name=crosby /&gt; A demonstration line was built on 4th Avenue S in Minneapolis in 1889. It was so successful that both cities converted their horsecar lines to electric power between 1889 and 1892, switching to standard gauge (1435mm) in the process. The Minneapolis and Saint Paul Street Railways were also consolidated into Twin City Rapid Transit (TCRT) in 1891 to help obtain financing for electric conversion.&lt;ref name=diers /&gt; Electric power was 600 V DC, supplied by coal-fired steam or hydroelectric plants. As the system expanded, the power plants switched to AC transmission since DC can only be transmitted over short distances. Substations were built around the city to transform the AC from the power plants to the 600 V DC for the streetcars. After this point (1892), the technology remained more or less the same. The rolling stock consisted of 13.1m long cars with controls at one end and air brakes (after 1902). The vast majority of cars owned by TCRT throughout its history were homebuilt in its Snelling Shops.&lt;ref name=diers /&gt;

==Early Market Development==
During the market development phase, the streetcar lines served the entire urbanized area of Minneapolis and Saint Paul and extended beyond it in places. It is hard to identify a &quot;market niche&quot; during this period because the system served the entire city and could conceivably have been used for any trip purpose where the origin and destination were both in the same city. In 1890, the systems in Minneapolis and Saint Paul were connected with a line along University Avenue, capturing the market for travel between the cities.&lt;ref name=diers /&gt;

Functional enhancement was important throughout the lifecycle of the streetcar, but especially in the early period. As can be seen in Figure 2, there were four years between 1880 and 1900 that had a net loss of track. While the loss in 1891 was part of the shift from horsecars to electric streetcars, the losses in the other years were due to reconfigurations of service. The street railways were the first urban mass transit in the area, and the Twin Cities essentially developed around streetcar lines. Most of the streetcar lines were radials out from downtown along a particular street or set of streets. TCRT (and its predecessors) generally paired two radial lines together to form a route. This was so that cars operated through instead of terminating in downtown. Turnarounds and layovers could then be done at the ends of lines, which were not as busy as downtown. However, these line pairings changed over time.&lt;ref name=diers /&gt; Geography, service frequency, and logical destination pairs were considered for service pairings. As the service pairings changed over time, some downtown links were no longer needed and were subsequently abandoned, while others were added.

Functional development was key to the development of the region and the success of the streetcar system. Thomas Lowry, the businessman who merged the Minneapolis and Saint Paul Street Railways into TCRT, also had real estate interests. As a result, streetcar extensions were done with land development in mind and often occurred before the surrounding land developed. In other words, streetcar development led land development, and streetcar lines have also been shown to be a significant predictor of residential density.&lt;ref name=xie&gt;Xie, F. and Levinson, D. (2010). How streetcars shaped suburbanization: a granger causality analysis of land use and transit in the twin cities. Journal of Economic Geography, 10(3):453.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to 'streetcar suburb' development, TCRT attempted to capture the leisure market by developing lines to Excelsior, White Bear Lake, and Stillwater. The company built amusement parks on Big Island in Lake Minnetonka and at Wildwood on White Bear Lake. It also operated ferries and sightseeing tours on Lake Minnetonka. TCRT lines served the Minnesota State Fairgrounds as well as the baseball stadiums for the Minneapolis Millers and Saint Paul Saints. The company ran special event trips to serve these events and carried a significant portion of the people attending.

==The Role of Policy==
Since the horsecar companies in Saint Paul and Minneapolis were founded about 40 years after the first horsecar company, they had the opportunity to learn from established systems. Due to the status of the horsecar as a hybrid mode, it is likely that the first systems drew from the operational policies of stagecoach lines as well as from railroads. By the time of the conversion to electric power, TCRT owned many of the same assets as a railroad (rolling stock, tracks, shops) and its management were also involved with railroads. Lowry was the president of the Soo Line Railroad at the same time TCRT was converting to electric streetcars.&lt;ref name=diers /&gt; Because of the similarities of these organizations and the familiarity Lowry and other management had with railroads, TCRT developed the same kind of hierarchical structure.

The Minneapolis and Saint Paul companies began as separate entities, but followed a similar process. The Minneapolis Street Railway Company organized in 1873 and started building track. It was granted a franchise by the City of Minneapolis in 1875, and this was confirmed by the Minnesota Legislature in 1879.&lt;ref name=kieffer /&gt; The franchise agreement with the city specified the locations of the lines it was to build, the types of service, and set deadlines. The agreement gave the company a monopoly, but set fares and required the company to maintain the city streets around the tracks. These agreements could be, and were, renegotiated as conditions changed. However, TCRT never managed to get out of the fixed fare and street maintenance clauses, although it would have liked to.

==Growth of Streetcars==
The growth of streetcars was mostly fueled by private investment. In the horsecar period, the Minneapolis Street Railway Company chose not to pay dividends, opting to reinvest all of its profits in system expansions. The system grew very quickly during this period and regularly expanded into undeveloped areas in an attempt to spur development. Therefore, the franchise agreement with the city served mostly as a minimum level of service. The companies were interested in expanding well beyond what the contract required, but had to maintain service on their original lines. In general, the cities were supportive of system expansions because they allowed the population to spread out. As a result, the Twin Cities became characterized by houses and small apartment buildings instead of the large tenements typical of eastern cities like New York.&lt;ref name=kieffer /&gt;

However, when the conversion to electric power began, both cities required their street railway companies to electrify all the lines in a short period of time. Both companies took on debt to do this, and merged to form TCRT in 1891 as a way to get financing from eastern capitalists.&lt;ref name=kieffer /&gt; The conversion to electric power would have happened anyway, but it might have taken longer without the contractual requirement. It was certainly a good investment, as companies throughout the country that switched from horse to electric power observed an increase in gross receipts of 30-300%.&lt;ref name=crosby /&gt; An analogy could be drawn to the conversion of railroads from steam to diesel or electric power. The most important lines switched over early on, but less important lines kept the old source of power for years after the first conversions. TCRT would have been unlikely to keep horses around for very long since they were expensive to operate, but the company might have tried to avoid taking on so much debt without the public intervention.

==The Mature Phase==
As the system matured, it began to feel pressure from automobiles and two clauses of its municipal contracts: set fares and street maintenance. Henry Ford developed his first car in 1896 and others soon followed. The car was initially a toy for the rich, but as it became mass produced it turned into a commodity that more and more people could afford. The automobile competed directly with the streetcar for passengers, but the increased prevalence of automobiles also made streetcar operation more difficult because of the increased traffic on the roads.&lt;ref name=diers /&gt;

The fixed fare policy took away the flexibility of TCRT to set its own price. These types of price controls were common at the time and applied to railroads as well. For a period of several years, the fare was set at 5 cents. This meant that, even if ridership stayed the same on a particular line, it became less and less profitable as inflation increased the operational expenses. Fare increases had to be negotiated with the Railroad and Warehouse Commission and the Commission often refused.&lt;ref name=v1&gt;on Streetcar, M. M. M. C. A. C. and matters, B. (1952a). Reports. Number v. 1 in Reports.&lt;/ref&gt; When a fare increase was refused, TCRT had to respond by trying to increase ridership, or cutting service and deferring maintenance.

Finally, street maintenance became a burden in the later years. In the 1870s or 1880s when the contracts were first developed, most streets were unpaved so the street maintenance clause meant that TCRT was responsible for maintaining its own tracks and plowing the streets after winter storms (extensions were used to plow the right lane since streetcars typically ran in the left lanes). However, the way these clauses were written meant that TCRT was required to remove its tracks and replace them at its own expense if the city decided to pave a street.&lt;ref name=v3&gt; on Streetcar, M. M. M. C. A. C. and matters, B. (1952b). Reports. Number v. 3 in Reports.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a significant expense when Minneapolis and Saint Paul began to pave all their streets. It became even more expensive as automobile traffic increased, since streets needed to be repaved more often. On at least one occasion, the conversion of 6th Avenue N to Olson Memorial Highway, TCRT refused to replace its tracks and converted the line to buses instead.&lt;ref name=diers /&gt;

A report to the Mayor of Minneapolis in 1952 summarized the problems facing the streetcar system. Cars had taken riders away and increased the level of traffic congestion. The streetcar equipment was outdated and needed reinvestment. The franchise agreements had been developed very early on and now severely limited the actions TCRT could take to improve profitability. Finally, traffic patterns had changed faster than the company could reconfigure its network.&lt;ref name=v1 /&gt; The rapid development of suburbs after World War II was primarily responsible for this. This report and a subsequent one recommended changes to the regulatory framework and suggested other changes like distance-based fares.&lt;ref name=v1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=v3 /&gt; They recommended regulation on a metropolitan, as opposed to a municipal level, which was later implemented in the form of the Metropolitan Council.

The streetcar network is gone now, so the system cannot be reconfigured to meet the needs of transportation in 2011 and beyond. However, some of the lessons from streetcar operations are applicable to its successor, buses, and others can be applied to efforts to reestablish a rail transit network in the Twin Cities. First, government policies should be reevaluated periodically to see if the are still applicable to the current market. Policies developed at a time when streetcars had a monopoly on urban transportation hurt their ability to compete when the monopoly eroded away. Transit systems are publicly owned today, making negotiations about government policy a little easier. Next, infrastructure costs should be assessed in an equitable manner. In its last few years, TCRT was essentially subsidizing car travel by paying to relay its tracks every time the road was repaved, and by continuing to plow snow in winter. When it was the primary user of the roads, it made sense for TCRT to pay for maintenance and plowing. As cars became the dominant user, the costs should have been shifted to car owners, but they weren't. Today, transit mode share is very small in the Twin Cities. If an effective transit system is a priority, then the subsidy on car travel should be reduced by increasing car-related taxes or implementing road pricing. It makes very little sense for government to be subsidizing car travel and simultaneously trying to convince people to take other modes.

The data set used in this analysis is a shapefile of historical transit routes in the Twin Cities produced by the Metropolitan Council.&lt;ref&gt;Available at: http://datafinder.org/metadata/HistoricalTransitRoutes.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This file has separate records for each link in the regional transit network from 1872 to 1954 showing the year the link opened and the year it shut down. Horsecars, cable cars, streetcars, ferries, and 1948 bus routes are included. The bus routes were eliminated for this analysis since they were a replacement technology, but the ferries were left in since there were relatively few of them and they developed and were operated in conjunction with the streetcars. Using the shapefile, the length of each segment was computed and the file was dissolved by starting year, then by ending year to obtain the length of track added or subtracted from the system each year. The track kilometrage in the system is displayed in Figure 1 and the change each year is shown in Figure 2. These values represent centerline mileage, so two tracks on the same street are not double counted. This measure might be more accurately described as system extent as opposed to kilometers of track.

The curve parameters are shown in Table 1. Because streetcars have gone through birth, growth, maturity, and decline already, K, the carrying capacity, was already known to be 602.162km. A three parameter logistic function of the form &lt;math&gt;S(t)=\frac{K}{1+e^{-b(t-t_{0})}}&lt;/math&gt; was fitted to the data. This was done in two phases: one representing system growth to maximum extent (before 1931), and the second representing system decline (after 1931). A least squares regression was used to determine the optimal value of b and to find &lt;math&gt;t_{0}&lt;/math&gt;, the inflection point using the relation &lt;math&gt;t_{0}=\frac{intercept}{-b}&lt;/math&gt;. For the growth phase, b was found to be 0.161 and the inflection point was in 1899. For the decline, b was determined to be -0.0586 and the inflection point was in 1974.

The S-curve for the growth period seems to be a good fit. The &lt;math&gt;r^{2}&lt;/math&gt; value was 0.928, the t-statistic for the intercept was -27.0, and the t-statistic for b was 27.1. Knowing that the maximum &lt;math&gt;r^{2}&lt;/math&gt; is 1.0 and the level of significance for the t-statistic is greater than 2, the curve is a reasonably good fit and the estimated variables are statistically significant. Qualitatively, the curve follows the data very well in the birth and maturing stages, but not as well in the growing stage. The rapid growth of the system in the 1880s seems to have happened around 5-10 years before the curve predicted it would. The halfway point, 300km, was reached in 1890 as opposed to the inflection point of 1899 suggested by the regression. By the 1900s and 1910s, network growth lags slightly behind what the curve predicted. However, we can also see that TCRT made major capital investments about once every ten years in this period: large sections of new track opened in 1905, 1906, 1913, and 1914. Given that new lines tended to open in fairly large segments, we would not expect the data to follow the curve exactly. With a sufficiently large sample size, like all street railroads in the United States, the data should be smoother and might fit the curve better. On the other hand, some of the anomalies are caused by external factors, such as the financial markets. The slowdown in the early 1890s, odd because it occurs right where the logistic curve predicts the highest rate of network expansion, can be explained by the Panic of 1893 which made financing for large capital expenses nearly impossible to find.&lt;ref name=diers /&gt;

On paper, the curve for the decline period is also a very good fit. The &lt;math&gt;r^{2}&lt;/math&gt; value was 0.928, the t-statistic for the intercept was 16.28, and the t-statistic for b was -16.02. The &lt;math&gt;r^{2}&lt;/math&gt; value is exactly the same, while the t-statistics are lower but well above the statistically significant threshold. Qualitatively, the curve is not such a good fit because it is nowhere close to the starting and ending points. However, because these are only two points, the least squares method favors a curve that best matches the rest of the data. Looking at what actually happened, a negative exponential function might better represent the decline. In any case, the regression produced a curve that represents the slow decline of the system in the 1930s and 1940s. The facts that this curve's inflection point is in 1974 and that it would never go down to zero   suggest that TCRT's streetcar network was abandoned prematurely. This view has been held by several analysts, and is supported by the fact that several of the managers who oversaw the conversion to buses (including Fred Ossanna and Barney Larrick) were later convicted of fraud and sent to prison.&lt;ref name=diers /&gt; Canals and railroads, which are other examples of mature transportation systems, declined to about half of their maximum extent and have continued to operate. It might have been possible for TCRT to cut some services and continue to operate the most profitable lines, but public opinion in the 1950s was not very supportive of transit and especially not of streetcars.&lt;ref name=diers /&gt; &lt;ref name=kieffer /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The invention and introduction of the automobile changed the world forever.  Today it is hard to imagine what life would be like without modern vehicles.  Our commutes to work, vacations, foods and goods would be drastically changed.  Having a personal vehicle is often part of the imagined “American Dream” and is a necessity in most American’s lives.  This mode of transportation was introduced to the masses in the early 1900s and has grown to become a part of the daily lives of Americans.

The automotive industry took off in the early 1900’s but has slowed in the 2000’s.  This mode of transportation has recently reached the maturity phase.  By looking at the number of passenger vehicles in the United States we will analyze and discuss the life cycle of this transportation mode including its birth, growth and mature phases.  We will identify these phases and comment on what was caused and affected by these changes in passenger vehicle prevalence. 

== Qualitative ==
=== Birth ===

In the 1800s transportation for an individual was limited.  Most people walked or used horses for their day to day travels, and carriages and sailing ships were used for longer distance trips.  In the mid 1800’s steam boats were introduced to the United States.  This decreased the travel time of goods and individuals and helped create powerful port cities along the United States waterways.  Trains and railroads were also invented and implemented in this time.  Railroads were initially used for passenger travel and cut not only the travel time of a passenger’s trip but the risk involved in taking the trip.  Crossing the country now took days instead of weeks and involved little exposure to the wilderness and natural elements.  Although both were monumental innovations the appearance of the automobile in the early 1900’s may be the biggest change the world has seen in transportation &lt;ref name=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt;.

The automobile can be defined as any self propelled vehicle.  Although horse powered vehicles existed and wind powered land vehicles had been designed, the first documented automobile using this definition was created in 1796.  The vehicle, designed by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot, was very large, steam powered and could travel up to 6 km/hr.  Shortly after this, gasoline and electric vehicles were developed.  These technologies evolved and were used on roads up until the late 1800’s &lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;.

The automotive industry took off in the 1900’s and the United States became the world leader for most of the twentieth century.  In the beginning automobiles were very difficult to make and many companies who entered this industry did not last long.  Many companies assembled vehicles from parts made by different manufacturer and produced very few vehicles during this time.  In 1913 the Ford motor company developed the assembly line approach to manufacturing cars which greatly reduced the labor and time needed to manufacture a vehicle.  This in turn reduced the cost of the final product, from $950 for a Ford Model T in 1909 to $360 in 1916, and madeowning a vehicle obtainable for the average American &lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;.

Personal vehicles were enticing to the average American for a number of reasons.  Current railroads could only go where tracks had been laid and lacked the freedom that an automobile allowed.  Different transit options that had developed, such as the street car, held a similar constraint of only operating on a specified route or electric track.  Both cost a trip fare and operated on a set schedule which may not work for an individual.  A vehicle allowed for more freedom for when and where a motorist wanted to travel.  A vehicle also allowed an individual to purchase a cheaper home on the periphery of a city and commute for work.  This created modern suburbs.

Although roads and turnpikes existed for carriage use before 1900, paved roads were not prevalent in the United States until the introduction of the automobile.  With the introduction of railroads, roads were used even less and many were not maintained.  The growth of the road system was dependent on the growth of the automobile industry and vice versa in the early 1900’s.  More roads allowed better access to more locations for the automobile consumer and more automobiles justified more investment into the road system.  Before this time states and cities were responsible for the financial aspects of building and maintaining a road because they were the ones who benefited from them.  By 1920 all states had some type of road organization that saw to the financing, building and maintaining of a road system. The federal government took an interest in a national road system in the 1910’s when they passed the Post Office Appropriation Act and the Federal Aid Road Act which organized a national system and designated funding.  In 1956 the Federal Aid Highway Act and the Highway Revenue Act designated funding for an upgraded national road system.  The government was interested in such a system to move troops and other defenses across the nation quickly.  This road network became the current Interstate Highway System &lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;.

=== Growth ===

The United States Army made use of automobiles during World War I which increased demand and pushed innovation.  After the assembly line method of production became standard other companies became involved in the market.  This gave the consumer more variety to choose from which increased competition.  The 1920’s saw many innovations in automobile technology.  Mechanical brakes were installed on vehicles, four wheel drive was created and safety glass that was harder to break was used in vehicles.  Passenger comfort was also considered when upgrading a vehicle.  By the end of the 1920’s most vehicles were enclosed and some even had heaters.  Because of these types of innovation a new class of luxury cars identified itself above standard vehicles as a status symbol for some.  Companies needed to come up with new innovations such as this to compete for the growing demand &lt;ref name=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt;.

After World War I the great depression hit which caused smaller companies to close down.  Because of the large investments needed to get an automobile plant and assembly line running many large companies became the front runners of the industry.  The 1920s and 1930s was when the Big Three in the United States, Ford, General Motors and Chrysler, began to dominate the market.  Ford was already a powerhouse in the automobile industry.  During this time Chrysler took over multiple companies including Maxwell Motor Company and the Dodge Brothers Company.  General Motors became more efficient by reorganizing it management structure and taking over Buick, Cadillac and other smaller firms.

The market still saw innovation in the types of automobiles being offered.  The body of vehicles became more designed during the 1930’s and aerodynamics where considered.  Car radios, automatics transmission and larger engines, up to a V-16, were also on the market in the 1930’s.

Both during and after World War II the economy bounced back from the great depression and consumer demand for personal vehicles increased.  With the new interstate highway system in place there were few constraints on where a motorist could travel.  The market seemed almost as big as how many drivers were in the United States.  Early vehicles were wearing out and some consumers had already “used up” multiple vehicles.  The used car market began.

A few other factors influenced the growth of the number of passenger vehicles in the United States during the beginning of growth period.  Using credit and payment plans to finance a vehicle were used early on as a way to make the personal automobile more affordable for the masses.  In an example of a positive feedback loop, many commercial businesses were being designed to be accessed by passenger vehicles such as malls and drive through restaurants.  People would buy vehicles to utilize these businesses thus increasing the demand for the type of business &lt;ref name=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt;.

The amount of growth begins to decrease in the 1960s.  This is in part due to the fact that those who needed a personal vehicle had probably already purchased a vehicle.  There were less first time vehicle owners than before.  The Vehicle Air Pollution and Control Act of 1965 set a limit for automobile emissions.  This and other safety requirements for vehicles may have caused an increase in cost due to the added features which would lessen the number of vehicles sold.  The 1970’s and 80’s saw an economic depression in the United States that would also slow the consumption of personal vehicles as individuals look for cheaper modes of transportation.  Many of the countries automakers were affected by the economic troubles and downsized their plants and employees.  Some needed to be bailed out by the federal government to continue to function in the US market  &lt;ref name=&quot;R7&quot; /&gt;.  The last big innovation in passenger vehicles occurred in the 1980s.  The creation of computers allowed this technology to be used in vehicles.  Passenger vehicles now had automated computer systems built in that could monitor vehicle functions and aid technicians in diagnosing malfunctions. 

=== Maturity ===

The market reached maturity in the mid 1990’s when the rate of growth of number of passenger vehicles slowed considerable.  Although small innovations in aesthetics, comfort and safety features are still being developed, few innovations affect the entire industry such as those during the birth and growth phase.  Some industry changing technologies are being researched within the market of passenger vehicles, such as long lasting electric cars and high fuel efficient vehicles, but no other mode of transportation looks to be competing with the passenger vehicle in the near future.  

If these new technologies were perfected and made efficient enough to compete with the combustible engine, a new growth segment of the mode may occur.  The costs, both initial and operational, of the vehicle containing the new technology would have to be comparable to current combustible engines.  This could also occur if the world runs out of fossil fuels and then a new or modified mode would arise to take the passenger vehicles place regardless of cost.

The companies in the automotive industry are moderately set.  No new companies have entered the market in decades, although foreign made vehicles are competing now more than ever with American products.  The Big Three are still the same as in the 1930s, and even though they have had some economic troubles, the government helps support them because their collapse would have large negative effects on the national economy &lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;.

“Lock-in” has constrained adaptations in the passenger vehicle.  Road design is highly regulated on a national level.  The design of the standard road sets a vehicles width, speed and other design features.  Federal laws on safety and emission standards have made some vehicle features standard that may not have been present without the requirement laws.  Consumer expectations also create a type of “lock-in”.  If a new vehicle or feature varies too widely from the current alternative, consumers may be hesitant to switch to the new product.  New features may also cause issues regarding the maintenance of a vehicle if a mechanic is unfamiliar with the technology.

=== Data ===

[[File:Hmwk3 1 data.png|frame|none|Table 1: Number of Passenger Vehicles in the United States per year &lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;R2&quot; /&gt;]]

The data from this analysis comes from two sources.  The 1960 to 2008 data comes from the Research and Innovative Technology Administration of the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.  This is a federal government organization that collects and distributes different transportation statistics.  The 1895 to 1929 data comes from a picture of a document, possible an almanac, which lists the number of passenger cars.  This picture is posted on railsandtrails.com, a small website made by a transportation enthusiast.  Although not knowing the source of this data may cause some uncertainty of the results, the data fits the expected curve formed by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics data.  Accurate data could not be found for 1940 or 1950.  It is estimated that the number of passenger vehicles in the United States still grew during these times although some lasting effects of the Great Depression may have slowed the market in the 1940s. 

=== Method ===
[[File:Hmwk3 chart.png|500px|thumb|none|Figure 1: Number of Passenger Vehicles in the United States with Best Fit Curve]]

The fit line was found using the equation Passenger Vehicles=K/(1+e^(-b(t-t_0)) ) where K is the saturation level, b is a coefficient, t is the year and t0 is the point of inflection on the curve.  An initial estimate K,b, and t0 were chosen and then the Solver analysis in Microsoft excel was used to change K and b to minimize the difference in the found and calculated number of vehicles.  The inflection point to was estimated to be around 1962.  Once solver had been ran the values for K and b were about 137 million and -.093 respectively.

A regression analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel.  This analysis found that R2 was .96 which means that the fit line is a good fit to the actual data.  There are two points on the graph that a discrepancy between the fit and data line can be seen.  Again, accurate data from 1940s and 1950s could not be found which may cause the difference seen at the beginning of the growth period.  The actual data exceeds the estimated data in the late 1980s and early 1990s on the chart and varies some from there.  This is where the mode reaches maturity.  This may be due to some settling into maturity.  The economy was good during this time which may have spurred market growth.  The drop could be due to the increasing awareness of environmental issues with vehicle emissions. 
 
=== Birth ===

By looking at the chart Number of Passenger Vehicles in the United States, the birth phase can be seen from 1895 to about 1920.  Although the automobile existed before 1895, they were not produced for consumers in the United States until about this time.  During this time the market for vehicles was being established as people became accustom to a technology that was unlike anything they had seen.  Paved roads were being built which would allow a vehicle owner to travel to more places.  

=== Growth ===

The growth begins a bit before 1920 which coincides with the creation of the assembly line and subsequent drop in price of the automobile making it a commodity priced for the average American.  The growth continues to be positive until the early 1960s and then slowly decreases until the 1990’s when there is a drastic decrease in growth.  Many factors contributed to the growth of the number of passenger vehicles in the United States at this time.  During this time major innovations in automobile technology were invented.  Personal automobiles were being marketed to Americans successfully as a must have item.  The middle class in the United States was getting larger and moving outside of the city to where a vehicle was one of few options for transportation needs.  

=== Maturity ===

The mature phase seems to start around 1990.  During this time the market had become saturated.  Most people who wanted vehicles had them, and no drastically new innovations occurred which made previous models obsolete.  New vehicles were still being sold when new drivers came of age and old vehicles wore out or were destroyed but at a much slower rate than before.  Household incomes have still not increased enough to make owning multiple vehicles an option for most Americans.

It is doubtful that the number of passenger vehicles will see a decay phase.  Americans have become dependent on personal vehicles and many would consider it a large cut in their standard of living to do without.  Unless a new mode of transportation is created, passenger vehicles are probably here to stay in the United States.

== Conclusion ==

Using the fit equation Passenger Vehicles=K/(1+e^(-b(t-t_0)) )  as  Passenger Vehicles=137000000/(1+e^(-.0925(t-1962)) ) provides a good fit for the number of passenger vehicles in the United States, shown by an R2 value of .96.  The data shows a mature mode of transportation with a birth, growth and mature phase.  This shows that passenger vehicles have probably completed their life cycle.  Many real life events in the United States throughout the century support this fact including changes in production, cost and distribution.  Unless enormous technological advances in passenger vehicle technology or the world runs out of fossil fuels, it is likely that the number of passenger vehicles in the United States will stay relatively steady for years to come.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''The use of Resistance Training in the Prevention and Treatment of Osteoporosis in the Elderly''' ==
&lt;small&gt;
==== What is Osteoporosis? ====
It is the decrease in bone density that enhances bone fragility and increases the risk of fractures and falls in the elderly. &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Bone re-absorption outweighs bone deposit as a result of osteoblasts becoming less effective due to aging, adding to age related bone loss. The composition of the bone matrix remains normal, it is bone mass that is reduced and becomes porous and light.

==== Possible Causes ====
The elderly are effected due to:
:* Inadequate physical activity - which causes a decrease in bone mineral density 
:* A poor diet
:* Previous chronic disease or injury [[File:Bone density scanner.jpg|thumb|right|125px|Bone Density Scanner]] 
:* Genetic factors such as race, frame size and/or family history may also have a negative effect

==== Diagnosis ==== 
First your GP will assess your risk factors for osteoporosis, including age, medical history and lifestyle.
Osteoporosis is diagnosed through a bone density test (Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry; DXA).&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; - ''(See picture right)'' 
It measures the density (strength) of your bones, usually at the hip and spine. The result from this test is called a T-score. This score will either be: Normal: (higher than -1), Osteopenia: (low bone density): between -1 and -2.5 or Osteoporosis: (-2.5 or lower) &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;

==== Prevention Methods ====
'''The first indicator of osteoporosis is often a fracture. This is why prevention strategies are ESSENTIAL.'''  
:* Have a healthy dietary intake – in particular calcium and protein intake. 
:* Regular participation in physical activity, most importantly resistance training (''Refer to Table 1'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
:* Quit smoking and decrease alcohol consumption
:* Increasing your exposure to limited sunlight to correct any vitamin D deficiencies, or with supplementation
:* Falls prevention measures (as falls can lead to fractures)

==== Treatment ====
:* Medication to stop further bone loss and prevent fractures &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; (Bisphosphonates,Strontium Ranelat and Monoclonal Antibodies (denosumab))
:* Hormone Replacement Therapy - Slows loss of bone but does not reverse osteoporosis
:* Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERMS)&lt;sup&gt;2,4,5&lt;/sup&gt; - Mimics estrogen bone sparing properties without targeting breasts or uterus.
:* Calcium and Vitamin D supplements &lt;sup&gt;2,5&lt;/sup&gt; 
:* Drinking fluoridated water - helps to harden the bones


==&lt;big&gt; Resistance Training in the Prevention and Treatment of Osteoporosis &lt;/big&gt;==

Regularly performed resistance training can offset the age related declines in bone health by  maintaining or increasing bone mineral density. &lt;sup&gt;3,6&lt;/sup&gt; Resistance training may also reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures by improving dynamic balance, muscle mass and overall level of physical activity. &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Benefits increase with additional hormonal and nutritional factors &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

==== Recommendations &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ====
[[File:TwoDumbbells.JPG|thumb|right|70px|Dumbbells can be used for resistance exercise]]
:*Pre-existing medical conditions, exercise progression and nutritional status should be evaluated and risk factor questionnaire. 
:*Exercise should focus on all areas of the body.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
:*Less intensive exercise to start with. E.g. Using own body weight over a shorter period initially. 
:*Progress into more intense exercises such as use of medicine balls and free weights. 
:*Depending on individuals' capabilities, can add high velocity and power. 
:*An increase of daily physical activity levels in areas such as transport, walking up stairs.
==== Table 1. Resistance Training Program &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ==== 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Intensity!! Frequency !! Duration !! Progression !! Goals !! Considerations
|-
| 15 reps of 8-10 exercises || 2 days per week || 1 or 2 sets up to 30-60 mins || Add a set after initial 2 weeks || 3 – 4 days per week at 10-12 reps per set || Avoid spinal flexion. Use slow and controlled movements. Target legs and back.
|}

==== Safety Considerations &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ====
:*Warm up &amp; down 5-10 minutes before each exercise session, incorporating low to moderate activity, including stretching  
:*Allow 48-72hrs recovery between sessions, which will also lessen the likelihood of over-training
:*Arrange a motion for each exercise that is pain free.
:*Ensure they have had advice from medical staff and quality supervision by an instructor or medical professional.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== History ==
The early 1800s, brought a revolution to transportation that changed how the world fundamentally worked. Rail technology not only made commerce incredibly more efficient, it made people many times more mobile than ever before. Rail companies represent one of the first examples of corporate structure. A fundamental portion of these corporations was rooted in passenger rail service (White 15).

== Beginnings ==
Passenger rail technology evolved rapidly both in structure and in purpose. Cars that transported people exclusively began looking much like carriages and carts. By 1870, the passenger car fleet began to take shape and specialized to meet specific needs of the customer. In this decade, cars were predominately coach style with baggage cars being used concurrently (Solomon 53). Sleeper cars also began to find their niche with travelers taking advantage of the quickly expanding rail network.

== Development ==
1880 saw the fleet of passenger cars specialize even further as it expanded. As travelers began to travel longer distances and as rail attracted a more diverse range of classes, cars were created that catered to the entertainment and daily needs of customers (Railroad Facts 34). This decade saw the development of both Parlor and Diner cars. Parlor cars were required to provide the male gentry a place to commune and smoke tobacco. Diner cars allowed passengers to eat in a more formal setting than the coach cars (Yenne 103).

== Guilded Age ==
At the peak of passenger car era in 1930, 63,900 vehicles were in use (Moody's 58). Rail was the dominate transportation mode of the day and the diversity and size of the passenger car fleet reflected this reality. At this point, business men could work on the train while traveling in office cars. Mail cars had also been widely deployed as a way for the Postal Service to increase efficiency while subsidizing the rail companies for providing service, especially in remote areas (White 354).

== Decline ==
After 1930, the number of passenger cars began to decline dramatically. People in the U.S. traveled less, in general, during WWII and mode substitution became prominent in the post-war period. Automobiles and the interstate highway system eliminated demand for most short and mid-range trips. The aviation industry then eliminated the demand for long-range trips, especially from the profitable business classes (Moody's 804).

== Predicting Passengers ==
Predicted Passengers is calculated using the formula: S(t) = K/[1+exp(-b(t-t0)] K represents the theoretical saturation level and is 63900 in the case of passenger cars. T(0) is the theoretical year at which half of K is reached. The value is 1888 in this scenario. 

[[File:Passenger Car Table.png|thumb|none|500px|Actual Number of Passenger Cars and the Predicted Number of Cars]]

== S-Curve ==
This graph shows the actual historical number of passenger cars in deployment in comparison to the predicted number of cars using the formula above. The model appears to very closely predict the actual levels of deployment from the historical data. Using this model, we can generally identify the major life-cycle stages of the technology. 1840 to 1860 marks the “birth” stage of the technology as it was slowly implemented and fine-tuned. 1860 to 1900 saw the widespread adoption of the technology at a break-neck pace and can be considered the “deployment” phase. 1900 to 1930 is where the technology came of age and reached “maturity” as very few cars were produced while maintaining very high overall numbers. 1930 to 1970 witnessed a wholesale abandonment of the technology and marks the “decline” stage.

[[File:Predicted Graph.png|thumb|none|500px|Graph Comparing Actual and Predicted Number of Passenger Cars]]

== Natural Log ==
The natural log of actual numbers of passenger cars is necessary to run more complex regressions of the data. This shows a smoother curve of the data graphed a section before.

[[File:Natural Log.png|thumb|none|500px|Natural Log of Actual]]

== Regression Statistics ==
The regression add-in on Microsoft excel was used to generate evaluation statistics of the data. With an R-squared statistic above .9 and a very high t-statistic, this model shows a very close fit to the data set. This means that the deployment of rail passenger cars statistically behaved in a very predictable matter until maturity.

[[File:Birth to Maturity.png|thumb|none|500px|Birth to Maturity]]

When the same regression is run on the decline of the technology, somewhat different results emerge. The R-squared comes in high at .82 and the t-statistic large but almost half of the opposite side of the curve. This small but noticeable difference can be attributed to the rapid mass adoption of alternative modes which caused the decline to happen at a much faster rate than the implementation of passenger cars.

[[File:Maturity to Decline.png|thumb|none|500px|Maturity to Decline]]

== Conclusions ==
The number of passenger cars in the U.S. followed a typical life-cycle for a transportation technology and fits closely with regression models. It grew slowly in the beginning years as the technology as the early-adopters did fine-tuning and costumers became comfortable with what it had to offer. Passenger cars then exploded in popularity and became widely adopted as the standard for travel in the U.S. In the time around WWI, its adoption continued to grow but at a slowing rate as the mature technology reached its natural limitations. After 1930, other modes emerged in direct competition with passenger rail cars. Automobiles and passenger planes emerged as more attractive technologies and a mass substitution took place causing the number of passenger rail cars to decline rapidly.

It will be interesting if this technology re-emerges as a viable mode. Deployment of roads has been in the “mature” phase for a few years and the market appears to be searching for a substitution. High speed rail has been all the rage among transportation planners as a high-capacity alternative to highways. Only time will tell if HSR catches in the U.S. and the passenger rail cars see a new age of glory.

      <comment>/* Invention of the Accessible Buses */  Corrected typo, author intended &quot;while&quot; not &quot;will&quot;.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The market for handicap accessible public transportation, specifically flexible modes of transit like buses, have arguably been a public concern since the dawn of that mode of transportation.  In America the first large scale demand for accessible public bus transit likely emerged following the waves of disabled veterans returning home from World War II.  This surge in potential users coupled with a rapidly shrinking network of inner city trolley services created a niche in the transportation market that would take another 50 years to fill.  In 1990 the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed created a federal mandate enforceable by law, that would further strengthen the steps many municipalities had taken to provide accessible public bus transit for their residents.

==Quantitative Analysis==

The life-cycle of the handicap accessible bus is unique in that it modified an already existing mode of transportation rather than creating an entirely new mode.  The birth of this mode was not simply a response to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1991 as one might think.  The Americans with Disabilities Act only accounts for the about half of the total growth in handicap accessible buses in service as of 2006.  Analysis of the data shows a likely inflection point (the time when the mode goes from growth that is constantly increasing to growing but slowly decreasing) of 1995.65, a time only a few years after the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed.

In fact this mode owes its birth to a growing market of handicapped users that pre-dates the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1991.  This indicates that municipal transit agencies where recognizing the need to provide transit services to disabled citizens long before the federal mandate made by the ADA and FTA.  As shown in the data in figure 1 there is a relatively steady rate of growth (the growth phase) from 1993 to 2001, although it is likely that the growth phase began prior to the 1991 ADA regulations.  At the end of the curve you can see the mode begins to enter its mature phase around 2002 at which point the number of accessible buses only increases by about two thousand a year.  

[[File:Life-Cycle and Regression Analysis of ADA Accessible Buses.jpg|thumb|Figure 1]] 

In figure 1 the regression line very accurately depicts the trajectory of the data as indicated by the R-squared value of 98.386.  This model predicts the mode will reach capacity at around 74,300 accessible buses nationwide.  Given the current trend of this line it is likely that this figure will be reach within the next decade however a rapidly expanding elderly population in the United States may push actual figures beyond the predicted capacity.

==Qualitative Analysis==

===Essential Technological Characteristics===

There is a long list of characteristics and measuring associated with providing equal accessibility to bus transit users that include physical changes to equipment and instructional changes for operators and users.  Part 38 of the Americans with Disabilities Act (Appendix 1) lists these and other specification as part of the accessibility standards for buses:

* Audible &amp; visual stop announcement (Section 38.37)
* Safety lighting (Section 38.31)
* Visual route identification &amp; audible announcement (Section 38.39)
* Harnessing, adaptable seating (Section 38.23)
* Hand rails, railings (Section 38.23.13 &amp; 38.29)
* Clear paths of travel and turning(Section 38.23)
* Right to assistance (ADAAA)
* Kneeling buses, ramps, &amp; lifts (Section 38.23)
* Handicap seating policies and signs (Section 38.27)

===Advantages===

Providing accessible buses for transit users has several benefits and drawback, for both the system and its users, some of which are clearer than others.   Perhaps the clearest advantage to providing handicap accessible buses is the resolution of the moral imperative this practice provides.  Because many disabled individuals rely on public transportation as their primary, and in some cases their exclusive mode of transportation, provisions for their use of this public amenity provides for the public good.  It also dramatically increases the productive capacity of these individuals by providing them more flexible and reliable access to sources of employment, shopping, recreation, and other resources.  It is also important to remember that these amenities provide access to public transit for those who are temporarily disabled, increasing the flexibility of the system to provide for a wider range of users. 

Another important advantage is the potential to increase transit ridership.  With public transportation systems across America constantly working towards increased ridership, both to cover operational costs and promote expansion of transit networks, those with permanent and temporary disabilities represented an untapped source of potential users.  Knowing that mobility can be impaired in a range of ways, it is logical that a disproportionate number of this demographic group has some reduced capacity to provide directly for their own transportation, due either to physical or mental impairments.  These barriers, discrimination in the job market, and other factors that economically disadvantage the disabled, make owning a specialized (adapted to enable a disabled driver) automobile even more difficult, further increasing their reliance on and need for accessible public transportation.

There are of course costs to increasing the capacity and ridership of any public transit system.  The foremost drawback is the initial cost of retrofitting existing buses already in service to accommodate the disable.  Additionally there are increases in costs associated with designing and building the complicated systems needed to make new modern buses and their stops handicap accessible.  Increasing accessibility will also inevitably result in reductions in system efficiency, with handicapped riders requiring longer boarding times, extra time for route and stop identification, and in some instances the need for driver assistance (securing wheelchairs, etc.).  

===Primary Markets===

The primary user market for accessible buses is those individuals with permanent physical disabilities requiring some assistance in boarding, seating, and off-loading.  Other markets include those who are mentally impaired, those with temporary disabilities, the elderly, and those who have other mobility barriers such as child strollers and shopping carts.  Geographically these buses tend to service the densest centers of population, typically central cities and areas of low income levels.  Additionally the expansion of transit services has given rise to handicap accessible Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) bus lines extending into suburban rings.  

===History of Other Handicap Accessible Transit Options===

The appearance of alternative modes of accessible public transportation is unique in their collinear evolution.  Since its inception, ADA regulations have required the modification of all modes of ‘public’ transportation for equal accessibility.  This created an environment of rapid collinear modification that essentially impacted all modes simultaneously in the United States.  Prior to ADA regulation, there was very little in the way of accessible public transit options due in large part to the high cost of retrofitting existing stations, vehicles, and other infrastructure.

Perhaps one of the most recognizable modes of handicap accessible transportation came with the advent of the van and mini-van in the 1960’s and 1980’s.  The introduction a private automobile with a sizable interior space resulted in the subsequent appearance small companies that emerged to modify these vehicles for handicap use.  The high cost of modifying these vans for handicap use has been a consistent barrier to access for this mode of transportation.  Because of the high cost of ownership small businesses and public services emerged to provide ‘by request’ service for those who could not afford their own vehicles.  Facilities with high levels of handicapped users such as nursing homes, hospitals, etc. also became early users of these limited modes of handicap transport.  The limited capacity of these vehicles, often limited to a single handicapped passenger, was another limiting factor to this mode capturing more of the market.

An important emerging market trend is the coming of ‘age’ of the baby-boomer generation.  As this large generation ages, their physical ability will continue to decline, a trend that will put increasing pressure on the existing accessible public transportation system.  Further compounding this trend is the increasing life-span of the average American, increasing levels of obesity, and to some degree the new generation of disabled veterans emerging for the decade long War on Terror.  Certainly these phenomena working in concert with local conditions will drive increases in system capacity and innovation.

===Invention of the Accessible Buses===

The principle technological innovations for improving accessibility have focused on both physical and operational improvements to buses.  Early bus modifications focused on improving movement in and out of the vehicle first with lifts and then with lowering.  Early lifts were of two primary types, integrated stair assemblies and dedicated.  Each of these early access technologies had drawbacks.  Integrated stair lifts occupied the stair space during deployment, preventing boarding by other passengers until loading is complete.  This type of lift is also difficult to deploy manually and been notorious for mechanical failures.  Alternatively dedicated lifts, while being more reliable and providing simultaneous boarding capacity, occupy large amounts of space in the bus that would otherwise be used of seating.  New boarding innovation has focused on level boarding.  Level boarding buses use a combination of sliding ramps and air suspension to temporarily low the bus to boarding level using the ramp to compensate for large grade and slope variations.

Other technological innovations have focused on conveyance of information to and from disable riders.  Stop request systems feature standardized mechanisms, multi-sensory indicators, and multiple initiation mechanisms allowing disabled users to recognize their stop, and access the indicate mechanism to convey their intent to disembark.  These include but are not limited to:

* Braille stop request button
* Audible signals from the driver
* Audible and visual station/stop name indicators
* Audible and visual stop indicators
* Multiple level stop indicator mechanisms

Signage standards for bus stops are also required to comply with ADA standards as shown in figure 2.

[[File:ADA Sign Requirements.jpg|thumb|Figure 2]]

Integration has also been a key sector of innovation for making accessibility improvements to buses that do not sacrifice efficiency.  For example most new buses have handicap seating areas that are integrated into the seating configuration of the bus.  This provides a handicap spot when needed and allows for standard seats to be folded down in place when the area is not in use for handicap seating.

Policy changes have also made for more efficient and standardized boarding and seating for all users.  The gentlemen’s rule is now a standardized policy for most transit authorities throughout the nation allowing handicapped riders to load first, disembark first, and sit in front of the bus.  ADA policy also dictates that drivers are required to provide assistance for boarding, seating, stop indication, and disembarking.

All of these innovations have been geared to increase efficiency while still providing a level of service equal to the typical able-bodied user.  One key distinction made by ADA regulations is that there should be no limitation to accessing public services like transportation, meaning that all users should be able to access all of the benefits of the transit service at the same level regardless of physical or mental status.  The requirement to avoid differentiation in service has impaired past transit efficiency, steering many agencies towards integration of technologies and standardization of processes as a means of streamlining the accommodation process.

===Early Market Development===

The transit market for disabled individuals was a wholly under-served market for decades.  This market has several segments, each requiring specific service provision to meet ADA guidelines.  Broadly these categories of users can be defined as follows:

; Mobility Impaired
: Primary needs include boarding and departure assistance, as well as restraint assistance
; Sensory Impaired
: Primary needs include stop and information indication and information
; Mentally Impaired
: Needs vary widely, but informational conveyance is a typical concern
; Elderly: Not necessarily disabled or impaired, but may need some assistance.
: Needs vary, but boarding and departure assistance and seating provisions are common
; Temporarily Impaired or Encumbered
: Seating provisions and in some cases boarding and assistance needs are common

Functional enhancement as required by the ADA, has serendipitously provided better transit service for temporarily impaired and encumbered users by mandating technological improvements that would have not been economically justifiable in other circumstances.  Similar benefits have also been extended to the elderly as a result of ADA requirements making public buses easier to enter and exit as well as providing priority seating.  

===The Early Role of Policy===

Although guidelines from the ADA and Federal Transit Administration do not require the immediate conversion of buses, the data shows that just a few years after the Americans with Disabilities Act is passed there are very high levels of accessibility across all bus types by 1993, as seen in figure 2.  This indicates that many municipalities had already begun the conversion process prior to the ADA requirements as a means of meeting the needs of local residents.  This is particularly true for the smaller and more flexible buses, seen in figure 3, which had in many cases already been converted for on demand handicap transport and para-trans operations by the mid-1990s.  Newer bus technologies like articulated buses had much lower levels of initial compliance with these standards, but rapid reconfiguration coupled with the mandate that new orders must meet with ADA guidelines resulted in a rapid increase in the percentage of accessible articulated buses by the year 2000.

[[File:Historic numbers of ADA Bus.jpg|thumb|Figure 3]]  

Because ADA regulations are the principle driver of change for this mode of transportation, and because the United States has such a strong focus on equal rights it is unlikely that policies were derived from other modes or countries.  Policy creation has instead been a continual process of innovation and refinement, often driven by the users (disabled users) who encounter new or persistent obstacles in their day to day activities.  ADA policies are created through an iterative process which looks like this (ADA, 2010):

* A user, agency, or other entity encounters an obstacle or anticipates a future problem and initiates the formal process.
* Guidelines, regulations, or changes are then published in the Federal Register
* These guidelines, regulations, and changes are then subject to a period of public comment and agency review.
* Final Rule is published in the Federal Register.

Nearly all accessibilities policies are sanctioned by government through ADA regulations.  As the mode of accessible buses continues into maturity operational changes and technological advancements can arise from embedded policies as long as they comply with federal regulation.  These regulations apply to any entity that is receiving Federal financial assistance from the Department of Transportation or any public entity that provides designated public transportation or intercity or commuter rail transportation, any private entity that provides specified public transportation; and any private entity that is not primarily engaged in the business of transporting people but operates a demand responsive or fixed route system (FTA, 2007).

===Growth Phase of the Accessible Public Buses===

The growth in this particular mode of transportation has been almost entirely driven by public sector involvement.  The high cost of technology per user in this market has been a barrier to entry for large scale deployment of accessible route-based bus transit outside the public sphere.  Although the public sector is the primary market actor, private sector participants may provide services provided they follow FTA and ADA guidelines according to FTA sections 37.7 which states that requirements apply to all over-the-road buses acquired by public entities or by private contractors to a public entity (FTA, 2007).  This and other details in sections 37 and 38 of the FTA/ADA regulations are important to the evolution of this transit mode because of their use in litigation action against both public and private entities.  

Lawsuits against both public and private bus service providers have had many functional impacts on the system as a whole.  A few examples of important precedent cases for litigation against both public and private transportation providers and their importance are listed below:

; Olmstead v. L.C.
: Relevance: The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) bars the unnecessary segregation of people with disabilities in state institutions
; Larry Beauchamp -vs- Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority
: Relevance: A case where plaintiff claimed ADA discrimination from an on-demand transit service offered by a private company as a supplement to the regular transit service provided by a city.

Litigation has become a primary mechanism for ADA standards enforcement for several reasons.  First the scope of ADA regulation is massive and would be impossible to enforce through agencies monitoring alone.  Second the ADA regulatory system can only be called on to ensure that initial design standards are met, any changes after initial inspection typically require a complaint report to trigger additional inspection and corrective action.  Third the ADA regulatory system by its nature has built in compliance monitors in the individuals it protects.  Users conducting their day to day activities function much more efficiently as standard monitors because of anonymity (not associated directly with the ADA or FTA), local knowledge, and repeated exposure to chronic offenders.  

Although this monitoring function acts as an effective monitoring for compliance mechanism it has also become a contentious issue over what has been viewed by some parties as over-litigation.  Business and small business owners maintain that this litigation is placing undo financial strain on their business do to legal and compliance costs.  In many instances their chief complaint is that the regulations are too complex and that compliance is difficult and expensive to achieve and maintain, especially for small businesses that are unfamiliar with ADA regulations.  These costs represent a significant barrier to entry for many private agencies attempting to provide regular or supplementary on-road transportation services. 

===Maturation of Accessible Bus Transit===

As the mode has matured and litigation concerns persist, attempts by the ADA, FTA, and private consultancies has been made to provide design and regulatory guidance for transit system operators in order to alleviate some of the complexities associated with the ADA and FTA regulation.  Additionally transit agencies themselves have in many cases created internal positions for ADA accessibility experts to ensure that all facets of the transit system comply with regulation.  Enforcement and maintenance of standards have also become inter-agencies roles as transit and planning authorities educate operators, assessors, and transit police on ADA requirements.

Although the standardization of accessibility technologies has made systems easier to use and understand these same standards have also resulted in the stagnation of technological innovation in signaling, signage, and loading mechanisms.  This standardization has undoubtedly permeated bus manufactures seeking economies of scale.  This combined with a relatively saturated market for accessible buses creates an environment which does not promote innovation in these technologies.  That said, the focus on expanding public transit networks in major metropolitan areas coupled with a figure of one fifth of the America’s population being disable (a number that is projected to continue to rise in the coming years) it is quite probable that we may see a market revitalization in the coming years.

===Opportunities===

While the accessible bus market is relatively mature in its life cycle there are still steps to be made in improving the system.  One key area of improvement is a more complete provisioning for the conveyance of information.  Specifically there are no regulations governing the conveyance of transit system specific information such as route and scheduling information.  This makes understanding the operation of system routes more difficult or impossible for those who are visually impaired.  Currently most systems rely on interaction between the driver and the disabled individual to convey bus number, where it goes, whether the bus is on time, crowding conditions on the bus, availability of other buses nearby that may better fit the user’s needs, etc.  This issue could be at least partially resolved with multi-sensory data conveyance tools.  Opportunities exist to integrate these tools with other high-tech bus management systems like GPS tracking and real-time updating station schedules.  

The maturity of the system, and the constant monitoring and threat of litigation has resulted in an environment that has necessitated the rapid maturation of handicap accessible buses in the U.S.  Technological advancement in accessible buses has therefore been largely the result of regulatory requirements rather than market forces.  The rapid rate of technological advances that punctuated early system improvements is likely to continue to decline while system operational and informational advancements are likely to yield the remainder of accessibility gains in the future for this mode.

==Conclusion==

As the average age and rate of obesity of U.S. citizens continues to climb over the next few decades it will be interesting to watch how accessible bus systems adapt to handle inevitable increases in demand over the coming decades.  It may be that significant system changes will not come until the mode itself is changed in some dramatic way, i.e. double decker buses may allow for advancements in different loading system technology.  Information technology may also improve system efficiency by conveying information more effectively allowing disabled rider to make more efficient system choices and transit operators to anticipate handicap user needs.

==Technology Description==
The automobile is a four-wheeled vehicle used for transporting passengers with its own internal combustion engine. Although latest automobiles may be completely electric or use a hybrid power of both electricity of gasoline, the majority of them generate power solely from burning gasoline. It is usually capable of running at around 80 mph nowadays, subject to road conditions and speed limit. 

As one of the major transportation modes, automobiles are suitable for traveling at a distance beyond the reach of walking and biking. They are often compared with public transit including buses, trains and subways. The most significant advantage of automobiles over public transit is its high level of freedom. Automobile drivers are not constrained by fixed timetables, bus stops, and train stations. In contrast, they can stop and go wherever whenever they want. They can avoid the frustration of waiting. The freedom and better mobility create more job opportunities and recreational travelling for the owners. Automobiles also provide more comfortable ride than the public transit with private space and radios while public transit can be very crowded thus uncomfortable during rush hours. There are disadvantages associated with automobile as well. Automobile drivers may experience frustrations with congestion while subway and train riders are not affected. Public transit also saves the time and energy in searching for parking spots. In addition, automobiles usually raise greater safety and environmental concerns. 

With its high upfront capital cost and continuing spending in fuel, repair, and maintenance, automobiles are much more expensive than public transit. From the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics data for the year 2000, transportation accounts for 19%, or $7,417 of the entire average household expenditure. Of that, private vehicles consume $6,990 (94%)($1,291 in gasoline and $3,418 in vehicle purchases).&lt;ref name=&quot;T2&quot; /&gt; The data not only show the high cost associated with purchasing and owning an automobile but also show the predominant place automobile is in people’s daily life. The target market of it aims at middle and upper class who can afford a car and those who have no access to public transit but live far away from their work or school. In terms of travel distance, extremely short distance that can be done by walking or biking does not require an automobile. Despite the fact that people do drive long distance for recreational purpose from time to time, airplanes provide a better service regarding speed and comfort at this realm. Therefore, automobiles serve somewhere in between, which is a range of distance that is too far to walk and too short to fly. 

==Identification of Developmental Phases==
===Method===
In order to find the S-curve and developmental phases for automobiles in the United States, data of the number of private vehicles in the United States were obtained from the Federal Highway Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation’s document “Highway Statistic Summary to 1995”. Yet since the population is growing in the United States, the increase in vehicle ownership in the States does not tell much about the development phases of this transportation mode. Thus, data of the population of the United States were also obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau for the period from 1925 to 1995. With the assumption that the average number of people per household is four, the data for average vehicle ownership per household (VOH) were obtained by dividing the total number of private vehicles by the population of the United States each year multiplied by a factor of four. And the VOH vs. year were plotted. 
To fit the real data, the following equation was used: 

:S(t) = K/[1+exp(-b(t-t0)]

where
:K: saturation level, which in this case, highest average number of vehicles owned per household in the United States
:b: adjustment parameter
:t0: the time when the growth rate reaches maximum and starts to slow down

The three parameters were adjusted to fit the existing plot as good as possible. The linear regression analysis was utilized. Because the guess function is not linear, it was rewritten into a linear form. The derivation is shown below: 
*S(t) = K/[1+exp(-b(t-t0)]
*1+exp(-b(t-t0))=K/S(t)
*exp(-b(t-t0)=K/S(t) – 1
*LN(EXP(-b(t-t0)))=LN(K/S(t)-1)
*-b(t-t0)=LN(K/S(t) - 1)
In a linear format, we have: 
*Y=LN(VOH/(K-VOH))=bt-bt0.
Several different K values were used to carry out a set regression analysis aiming to get R as close to 1 as possible. b is the X variable 1 value given in the regression analysis report. And the value of t0 can be calculated by dividing the intercept value by minus b. 
The tool Solver in Microsoft Excel was also used to minimize sum of square differences between the predicted and actual values to obtain the optimal parameters. The results were same.

[[File:Number of Automobiles per Household vs. Year.png]]
*Figure 1: Vehicles per Household vs. Year

The K value is approximately 2.54 when the error is minimized, which means that the model estimate the maximum number of vehicles per household in the United States will not exceed 2.54. t0 is about 1955, representing the year at which the growth rate reached maximum and started to decline. With the optimal parameters, if the prediction line is extended into the future, VOH will reach the maximum around the year of 2100.

==Analysis==
===Before the Advent of Automobile===
Prior to the advent of the automobile, people took animal powers for granted for short distance travel.&lt;ref name=&quot;T1&quot; /&gt; Shorter trips were made via horse driven wagons and carriages. The most important disadvantage of such travel mode is that it is very slow. Horses need rest, thus making long endured trip impossible. Although trains are much faster, railroads primarily only go through and stop at large cities. They don’t offer convenient service to go to smaller towns and take shorter trips.

The slow speed of the existing carriage was obviously constricted by the limitation of horses’ strength. With the rise of the steam engines by James Watt, engineers have attempted to apply the technology to small vehicles as early as 1769, though limited by technological issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;T7&quot; /&gt; As people have seen the rise of motorized trains, the desire for higher speed travelling not just limited on tracks but wherever they can grew. When the internal combustion engines came along in the beginning of the 1800s, engineers have been trying to motorize vehicles with them in order to achieve high speed. The successful results have led more and more engineers working to incorporate combustion engines with wheels to make a horseless carriage. 

===Invention===
Automobile is a combination of various type of technology. During its early period, it was basically a horseless carriage: similar kinds of wheels and shape. The biggest different is the power source where animal power is either replaced with steam powered engine or internal combustion engine or electricity, which all require technological expertise in physics and chemistry. In addition, without pulling the rope to tell horses to turn, automobiles were steered with a tiller. Steering wheels were invented later and became standard. The process of combining all the pieces together to make the automobile to work as a unity requires even more advanced mechanical expertise.

Early innovations with steam powered vehicles were hindered by a lack of capital. British engineer Richard Trevithick’s steam powered vehicle was capable of running at a speed up to 12 mph reliably. But he did not have financial support from investors to do further research and development. Similarly, the American engineer Oliver Evans obtained the exclusive rights to operate steam-powered vehicles from Maryland Legislature. Yet he couldn’t raise the $3,000 startup fund to launch his steam-powered wagon company because the onlookers thought the vehicle would be too slow.&lt;ref name=&quot;T8&quot; /&gt; Electric automobiles were quite popular for some time around the 1900. But soon the requirements for charging facilities, which were virtually nonexistent at that time and the excessive weight of the batteries outweighed the advantages. In comparison, gasoline can be supplied by any stores and was cheap then. As a result, gasoline automobile was adopted as standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;T8&quot; /&gt;

Many minor shifts from the original design came from practical experience. The first long distance travel was made by Karl Benz’s wife, Bertha Benz. Karl Benz, who was generally considered as the inventor of the first modern automobile, was trying to perfect everything before the next step, which made his wife frustrated enough to take the first trip with the her husband’s design. Her experience during the trip provided great insights into how to improve the initial design: she needed to buy gasoline to finish the trip; she needed to push the car uphill because it didn’t have enough horsepower; she needed to use her hatpin to unclog the fuel line; she improvised an insulator to solve the short-circuited ignition problem; she also needed to replace the leather on a brake shoe.&lt;ref name=&quot;T9&quot; /&gt; All these incidents contributed to improvements in various aspects including gears, material, engine, ignition, and etc. It was exactly these small improvements that added up to the existing predominant technologies such as new ignition technology, brake system, fuel tank, low gear for climbing hills and so on.

Initially automobiles were only meant for the wealthy as they were expensive to make. Henry Ford applied the supply chain production process to his Model T automobile, which significantly cut both cost and production time down to the point that everyone can have an automobile. And the improvements were sustained: in 1913, the cost of the Model T Touring car was reduced to $600 with 250,000 production that year; The cost was reduced further to $360 and the year’s production exceeded 700,000 during 1916; By 1927 when Ford stopped making model T, the cost was below $300 and over fifteen millions were sold.&lt;ref name=&quot;T3&quot; /&gt; Automobile manufacturers all over the world quickly adopted and further improved this process. For example, Japan modified the mass production to a more flexible one. The dramatic improvements in production process contributed to the quick growth that came later. 

===Early Market===
According to Flink, the major competition for automobile at its birth phase came from the cheaper and more reliable railroad and water transportation in the United States, which were heavily subsidized by the government. Also the improvement progress for public roads was very slow. In addition, the automobiles were quite expensive at first. Only the wealthy people can afford it. It was not until Ford introduced the supply chain mass production method to dramatically decrease the cost and time that his Model T became readily available for purchase at an affordable price to more people. 

With more improvements in speed and efficiency, more and more people began to appreciate the advantages of travelling in an automobile: it provided great freedom with much higher speed than the old carriage so that they can travel a decent amount of distance quickly and continuously. During the 1920s, a lot of refinements took place to make automobile ride more comfortable. The introduction of ethyl additive for gasoline in 1923 boosted both performance and fuel economy. Some sedans even began to load a heater. Automatic chokes, easy-shifting synchromesh transmissions and etc. made driving easier.&lt;ref name=&quot;T10&quot; /&gt; Better technology attracted more customers and more drivers in turn spurred the demand for improving roads and constructing new roads. Enhanced infrastructure for automobiles served the existing market in return while making the automobile an even more appealing transportation mode.

===Policy in the Birthing Phase===
The policies regarding the birth of automobiles were not all pleasant, especially in England. Under the horse-drawn transportation interests, the turnpike trusts that were in charge of the highways charged discriminatory tolls against motorized vehicles. In 1865 Parliament passed representing the railroad owners the notorious Locomotive Act, the Red Flag Act. It limited the speed of what they referred to as “road locomotives” to 2 mph in towns and 4 mph on the highway.&lt;ref name=&quot;T8&quot; /&gt;

When automobiles became more accepted, policies regarding the operational standard began to emerge. To ensure safety, the American adopted drive-on-the-right-side policy to avoid collision, which would be hard to change once the habit had been established. Speed limit was also introduced, varying by road types and states. Toll roads were applied to automobiles as well in order to finance part of the road construction and maintenance. Traffic signs were adopted and standardized using minimal words and mostly symbols to convey ideas easier. Any change in the existing acknowledged commonsense would arouse confusion to the drivers and may cause accidents.

The government also promoted automobiles by investing in transportation infrastructure, building new roads and improving existing ones. Such emphasis on automobiles would attract more demand for automobile while making the country “run on gasoline”. 

===Growth Phase===
In the growth phase, people’s perception towards automobiles has been clearly established. The wait-and-see mentality switched to reasoning of the necessity of owning an automobile as the primary transportation mode. Meanwhile, the government invested massive amount of money in infrastructure construction including the interstate highway system, which to some extent provided an indirect subsidy to the automobile industry. The technology established itself a convenient and efficient way of travelling, drawing huge demand. In addition, there weren’t much competition to it. The airplanes were still at its birth phase. The automakers all over the world were spending extravagantly into improving the technology and marketing. All the conditions contributed to the predominant place automobiles stand in the U.S transportation system. The federal government also provided generous funding into automobile-related university research programs aiming to further advance the technology. 

The drawbacks associated with such quick expansion in the auto industry were significantly increased carbon emission and fatality in the United States.  In the 1970s, the federal government began to control automobile design by implementing tight laws to control emissions and to improve safety, which caused a bit of chaos in the automobile industry in the mid 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;T10&quot; /&gt; This act led to researches in both the industry and universities to improve automobile’s fuel economy with the determination for sustainable development.  

===Mature Phase and Future===
After the growth phase, the automobile almost reached its peak as a transportation mode in the United States, as what was shown in the simulation. The results showed that there is still space for growth yet slow and minimal. In this period, dramatic improvements are highly unlikely while only polishing of the existing system can be achieved. However, in this specific case, because I measured the number of automobiles per household, there still exists demand for automobiles with the population growth. The industry will not die unless that there comes an alternative that will replace automobiles entirely. 

Automobile companies all over the world are pouring in huge amount of capital to improve fuel performance. Among them, the Japanese automaker giants Toyota, Honda and Nissan are especially notable. Toyota’s Prius has been the most popular hybrid vehicle that touted a 50 plus MPG. Nissan also rolled out its electric car Leaf recently. Alternative energy such as solar power can be taken into consideration as the future power source for the automobiles. The U.S. transportation infrastructure is so heavily dependent on gasoline that people often raise concern for the fuel run-out in the future and they also propose the possibility of using public transit to replace parts of the interstate highway system, especially the high speed rail technology. However, the lock-in effect made the possibility of using the new high speed rail technology widely in the United States quite slim.  

During the economic depression from 2007, the government nationalized General Motors and Chrysler in order to save the American auto industry and protect the existing markets and customers based on the reasoning that automobiles have become an indispensable part of the American daily life. The future of automobile in the United States may not change much in terms of design and technology, yet new type of uses such as Zipcar may change the way we think of automobile ownership and the future trend of it.

The Interstate Highway System (officially known as the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways – after the president who signed the authorizing bill) is a network of approximately 46,750 miles of grade-separated, limited-access freeways and highways&lt;ref&gt;Federal Highway Administration. Annual Highway Statistics for 1996 through 2008, (VM-3). Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt;.  It began with the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, which authorized construction of the system, and was intended to connect most major cities and regions in the United States.  Today, the Interstate Highway System connects all 48 contiguous states. 

==Life-cycle Pattern:  Vehicle Miles Traveled==
===Life-cycle===

Like many transportation and infrastructure systems the Interstate Highway System follows a roughly S-curve shaped pattern of development.  Its lifecycle can be divided into three distinct phases of birth, growth, and maturity.  In the initial birth of the new transportation technology growth is slow as its role is clarified and norms are established.  Once the benefits of the technology begin to be more widely understood, the technology enters a growth phase where expansion occurs rapidly.  Investment, public or private, increases and the system gains many new entrants.  After the system reaches its maximum extent, it enters the maturity phase of its growth.  Typically consolidation occurs, and inefficient or superfluous routes are discontinued.

===Methodology===
[[File:Annual Vehicle-Miles Traveled - U.S. Interstate Highway System.png|thumb|Vehicle-miles traveled, observed data and predicted values along S-curve]]&lt;ref&gt;Federal Highway Administration. (1997, July).  Highway Statistics Summary to 1995, (V-20: VM-203, II-4: MV-200). Washington, DC: Teets, Mary K., Editor&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Federal Highway Administration. Annual Highway Statistics for 1996 through 2008, (VM-3). Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of the annual vehicle-miles traveled on the Interstate Highway System shows that it follows this pattern of development.  Fitting the S-Curve requires an initial single variable linear regression to determine the b-value coefficient used in the logistic function of the S-Curve.  The regression is of the form:
	Y=bX+c; where Y=LN(Vehicle-miles/(K-Vehicle-miles)), and X=Year
K is the maximum extent of the technology, in this case estimated to be 750,000 vehicle-miles
Once b is found, it can be used to determine the inflection point (t0=Intercept/-b), and the estimated extent of the technology using the S-Curve.  The function is of the form:
	S(t)=K/[1+exp(-b(t-t0)], where t=time, t0=inflection point, and K=saturation point&lt;ref&gt;PA 5232 HWA 3; University of Minnesota - David Levinson&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth of the Interstate Highway System (1956-1970)==
===Existing Modes===

Prior to the construction of the Interstate Highway System in 1956, rail was still the most dominant form of long distance transportation for both freight and passenger travel.  However the automobile had been replacing rail travel steadily since the middle of the first decade of the 1900s.  Rail volume was declining for most of this period, with brief upticks during World War I and World War II due to rationing of car parts, particularly rubber, metals and fuel.  However despite these brief setbacks, automobile growth continued to grow rapidly.  In 1900, there were approximately 8000 passenger cars in the United States.  By 1930 this number had grown to just over 23 million and by 1955 there were 52 million automobiles on the road&lt;ref&gt;Federal Highway Administration. (1997, July).  Highway Statistics Summary to 1995, (V-20: VM-203, II-4: MV-200). Washington, DC: Teets, Mary K., Editor&lt;/ref&gt;.  

The rapid growth of the automobile put considerable stress on the existing roadways in the United States.  These roadways were largely one or two lanes, were not grade separated and maintained and funded by states and local municipalities.  As such they were unequipped to deal with the growing volume of vehicle use, both in terms of personal automobiles and shipping via trucks.  In 1953, the Bureau of Public Roads released a report saying that only 24% of interstate roadway was adequate to meet the demands of current traffic levels&lt;ref&gt;Weingroff, Richard F., (1996). Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956: Creating the Interstate System. Public Roads, 60 (1)&lt;/ref&gt;. In the 1930s and 40s some regionally contained limited-access divided highways were being constructed and enjoying a large degree of success, notably the Pennsylvania Turnpike which was the first of its kind to be constructed in the United States.

===Planning the Interstate Highway System===
[[Image:Highways1955.gif|thumb|right|1955 map: The planned status of U.S. highways in 1965, as a result of the developing Interstate Highway System]]
The success of the early limited-access highways increased pressure on the Federal government to begin the development of a national highway system that could support the growing automobile traffic in the United States.  Both President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Congress began exploring the idea of a network of superhighways in the late 1930s and early 40s.  Roosevelt, fearing a return of the Great Depression after WWII, wanted to incorporate the construction of the superhighway network into his broader public works investment plans as a means of providing jobs for returning war veterans and other people out of work&lt;ref&gt;Weingroff, Richard F., (1996). Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956: Creating the Interstate System. Public Roads, 60 (1)&lt;/ref&gt;.  In 1938, Congress passed the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1938, which directed the chief of the Bureau of Public Roads to conduct a feasibility study of six interstate toll road corridors&lt;ref&gt;Federal Highway Administration. Origins and Construction of the Interstate System. Washington DC: Mertz, W. Lee., Author&lt;/ref&gt;.  The study found that in all likelihood, the amount of traffic across these routes would not be sufficient to support a toll road, and that government funding would have to support them in some capacity&lt;ref&gt;Weingroff, Richard F., (1996). Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956: Creating the Interstate System. Public Roads, 60 (1)&lt;/ref&gt;.

Although the idea of an interstate highway system garnered a great deal of support in Congress, and was popular among the public, little progress was made on the matter because the massive investment in the war effort took priority over large infrastructure investments at home.  In 1944, the second Federal-Aid Highway Act designated 65,000km of interstate highway system to be selected by the various state highway departments.  However no special funding was authorized for the construction of the system, resulting in resistance from states that did not want to reallocate federal aid away from local needs.  The first federal authorization of funds specifically for the construction of the interstate highway system came in 1952, with $25 million from the federal government on a 50-50 matching basis&lt;ref&gt;Weingroff, Richard F., (1996). Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956: Creating the Interstate System. Public Roads, 60 (1)&lt;/ref&gt;.

Finally in 1956, a comprehensive program was enacted to begin construction in earnest.  President Dwight D Eisenhower, an even stronger advocate for the system than President Roosevelt was, recognized the importance of a national system of interstate highways.  In 1919 he was a participant in the Army’s first transcontinental convoy from Washington, DC to San Francisco.  The journey suffered a series of mechanical difficulties and infrastructure failures and took over two months to complete. This experience, as well as his experience with the German Autobahn during World War Two had convinced him of the value of the interstate system.  In addition to President Eisenhower’s support, the postwar affluence of the United States had increased pressure even further on existing highways and the ramping up of the Cold War provided a national defense justification for the system.  In short, by 1956 the Interstate Highway System was an idea whose time had come.

===The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956===

The modern Interstate Highway System began with the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, which was approved by the Senate on June 26th by a vote of 89-1 and signed on June 29th by President Eisenhower&lt;ref&gt;Weingroff, Richard F., (1996). Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956: Creating the Interstate System. Public Roads, 60 (1)&lt;/ref&gt;.  The act authorized 42,500 miles of interstate highway system to be completed by 1975.  All interstate highways were to be constructed using very high standards.  It was designed to have no intersections and traffic signals, and to be grade-separated at traffic and rail crossings and in urban areas.  Grades and curves were designed to reduce or eliminate blind hills and safe navigation at high speeds&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Wendell &amp; Love, Jean. (June 1996). 40 Years of the US Interstate Highway System: An Analysis. American Highway Users Alliance. http://www.publicpurpose.com/freeway1.htm#intro (accessed 10/2011)&lt;/ref&gt;.  The act stated that construction and maintenance was to be funded by a user fee federal gasoline tax.  The federal tax was planned to provide 90% of the construction cost, with the remainder coming from the states, mainly in the form of their own user fees.  To that end, the federal gasoline tax was increased by one cent.

==Growth of the Interstate Highway System (1970-1995)==
===Expansion===

Following its authorization in 1956, the Interstate Highway System grew rapidly, both in terms of absolute length and in terms of traffic volume.  By 1960, more than 10,000 miles had opened, doubling in five years to 20,000 open miles in 1965 and reaching 30,000 miles in 1970&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Wendell &amp; Love, Jean. (June 1996). 40 Years of the US Interstate Highway System: An Analysis. American Highway Users Alliance. http://www.publicpurpose.com/freeway1.htm#intro (accessed 10/2011)&lt;/ref&gt;.  By 1994 the system was approaching its current size in terms of mileage (approximately 42,000 miles), yet it only made up 1.1% of the total mileage extent of transport systems in the United States.  Despite its relatively tiny total mileage, it carried approximately 23% of the market share of all transportation systems.  The rapid changeover from other modes to the Interstate Highway system reflects its usefulness, particularly between cities.  The interstate highways have reduced average travel times between cities by an estimated 20% and some much higher, for example travel time from Atlanta to Birmingham has been reduced by approximately 40%&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Wendell &amp; Love, Jean. (June 1996). 40 Years of the US Interstate Highway System: An Analysis. American Highway Users Alliance. http://www.publicpurpose.com/freeway1.htm#intro (accessed 10/2011)&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Engineering the Interstate Highway System===

As previously mentioned, the United States did have some limited-access highways built before the construction of the Interstate Highway System.  These parkways and freeways, like the Pennsylvania Turnpike, were largely modeled on the German Autobahn.  The interstate system followed suit, integrating the higher design standards, wider shoulders, more steeply curved surface, and separate grades; the interstate system actually incorporates much of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, as well as some other early limited-access highways. 

In order to successfully complete the system, highway engineers needed to implement newly advanced technologies and improve on many existing ones.  Asphalt had improved greatly in World War II, largely because of the requirements of military aircraft runways.  Highway engineers developed larger equipment, such as electronic leveling controls and extra-wide lane finishers to pave two lanes at a time&lt;ref&gt;Hoel, Lester A. &amp; Short, Andrew J., (May-June 2006). The Engineering of the Interstate Highway System: A 50-year Retrospective of Advances and Contributions. TR News, 244, 22-27&lt;/ref&gt;.  Other major advancements in road technology include drainage, the movement from clay culverts to metal and concrete, and bridge spanning technologies like pre-stressed concrete and segmental construction.

==The Mature Interstate Highway System (1995-Present)==
===Impact===

The impact the Interstate Highway System has had on the social, economic, and cultural life in the United States in undeniable.  By significantly reducing travel times, especially across large distances, it has helped the truck shipping industry develop into its modern form.  Freight costs have been reduced substantially, with tractor-trailer operating costs estimated to be 17% lower on interstates than on other highways&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Wendell &amp; Love, Jean. (June 1996). 40 Years of the US Interstate Highway System: An Analysis. American Highway Users Alliance. http://www.publicpurpose.com/freeway1.htm#intro (accessed 10/2011)&lt;/ref&gt;.  Improved freight shipping translates into inventory benefits for retailers who practice “just-in-time” delivery, and also reduces costs passed on to consumers in the form of shipping.  

Reductions in travel costs as a result of the Interstate System have also had an impact on land-use and development in the United States.  The development of the interstate system coincides almost directly with the growth of “suburban sprawl”.  While there are likely many factors at work behind increased suburbanization, data suggests that the interstate highways are at least partially responsible.  There are some estimates that indicate that if the Interstate Highway System had never been built intra-city commutes would double, while suburb to suburb commutes would be halved&lt;ref&gt;Baum-Snow, Nathaniel. (2010). Changes in transportation infrastructure and commuting patterns in U.S. metropolitan areas, 1960-2000. Paper presented at the American Economic Association Meetings, Atlanta&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Funding===

Through 1996, close to the final extent of mileage construction, the Interstate Highway System had cost $329 billion dollars (1996 dollars), making it one of the largest infrastructure investments in human history, and the largest in U.S. history.  Its original cost was estimated to be $41 billion in 1957 dollars, fairly close to its total cost of $58.5 billion adjusted to 1957 dollars&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Wendell &amp; Love, Jean. (June 1996). 40 Years of the US Interstate Highway System: An Analysis. American Highway Users Alliance. http://www.publicpurpose.com/freeway1.htm#intro (accessed 10/2011)&lt;/ref&gt;.

Interstate construction and maintenance is funded primarily through user fees in the form of gasoline taxes.  The federal government’s contribution is around 93% supported by the gas tax.  State and local contributions vary, but generally come from property taxes or some means other than a user fee&lt;ref&gt;Federal Highway Administration. Funding for Highways and Disposition of Highway-User Revenues 2007. (HF-10). Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt;.  There is very little money allocated to the expansion of the Interstate Highway System for at least two reasons.  The first is that the system has reached its planned extent, and while there are some other expansions slated, the bulk of the work has been done.  The second is the increased maintenance costs associated with the expansion of the suburbs.  As development springs up along the interstate highways, maintenance costs of those stretches increase through higher use, increased access points, and more grade-separated crossings.

===Future Prospects for the Interstate Highway System===

While the Interstate Highway System has reached maturity, it is not going to be replaced any time soon.  There is currently no transportation technology that has the capacity to provide the level of service, at the level of cost, that the Interstate Highway System does.  There may be some upgrades in electronic systems or “smart roads” to take advantage of the possible computerization of personal automobiles and freight trucks.  Depending on how that technology develops, the Interstate System could experience a second life-cycle process that capitalizes on the significant increases in capacity, speed and overall efficiency a fully computerized highway system could provide.

= Communism as Classless Society =

Communism requires a completely classless society, however by having a ruler, dictator etc. you create a class of those who rule, and those who do not. Communism using Russia as an example, there were a handful of people who had tremendous amounts of power, which is the very thing communism hoped to fight in capitalism. Communism is then closer to Anarchy than Socialism, and Anarchy has never existed for any extended period of time.

= Atrocities Committed by Communist Dictators =

In an attempt to create a Utopian Society, these are statistics on what you find in communism. First we will stop at Russia, under the rule of Jospeh Stalin a very important communist ruler, he had over 25 million people killed during his reign&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yakovlev2002CenturyofViolence|Yakovlev (2002) ''Century of Violence'']] p. 234: &quot;My own many years and experience in the rehabilitation of victims of political terror allow me to assert that the number of people in the USSR who were killed for political motives or who died in prisons and camps during the entire period of Soviet power totaled 20 to 25 million. And unquestionably one must add those who died of famine—more than 5.5 million during the civil war and more than 5 million during the 1930s.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;, more than Hitler, who killed nearly 18 Million people.

= Requiring a Highly Moral Society =
else everyone would take advantage

= Where Do Rights Come From? =
if they come from the state, then can they take them away. Decide one is not human? 

= Goals of Communism =
Abolishment of family, freedom of religion, etc. . Communism takes control of all newspapers, all media (control of what is written, what is shown on television etc.) in which there is no freedom, not even the freedom of private property.

==The Model==

[[File:Subway Ridership.jpg]]

The data used for the model was annual ridership in New York’s subway system from 1901- 1998. The data came from the Metropolitian Transit Agency (MTA). Due to the length of the mode timeline there were issues finding a line to fit the data. Attempting to capture the two periods two lines were chosen. The first line is a good representation of the growth cycle but the second was not a good fit. There is a leveling off period after the growth and decline but then there are some spikes at later periods. It is possible ridership variations in the mature stage are being effected by gas prices, economic conditions, and other factors causing the ridership to fluctuate.

==History==

===19th century New York City- Before the Subway===

During the 19th century New York City was quickly becoming a very large and overcrowded city. Immigration from Europe brought a steady flow of new people into the area causing the population to skyrocket during this time. With the massive growth came larger problems from the flow of immigrants into the city. Housing, overcrowding, and sanitation were growing challenges for New York, especially in the neighborhoods that housed tenements for the new immigrants. 

'''Available Modes of Transport	'''

The large number of immigrants moving into the city also created congestion on New York’s multi-modal roads. At that time “Manhattan’s roads were packed with pedestrians, horses, wagons, omnibuses, and the most common form of public transit, horsecars moving over rails in streets” (Derrick, 2001). So we can see that at this time there were a large number of people that needed to move around the city and a variety of rather inefficient ways to do so. The modes listed above were not practical for the overcrowded tenement districts. They were all slow modes of transport, they were competing for space, and each mode had a very limited carry capacity. 

===Horsecars===

The above quote describing horsecars as the most popular mode is important to note. Public health and sanitation were important issues at that time and having to clean up after the horsecars would not have been helping the problem.  Since none of these forms of transport were very efficient there was also no reason for those living in the crowded area to move because it would be very difficult to travel to and from work.  The horsecar system was overcrowded enough that it was not worth pushing forward. Instead of expanding that system reformers began to look to new ways to transport people (Derrick 2001).

===Reformers find housing solutions in Rapid Transit development===

Since there was no good way to get further than a couple miles it made sense to look for ways to move people longer distances so they could spread out the housing. Early housing reformers in New York were looking for solutions to the growing housing problem. Clearly the United States did not want to limit immigration when it was trying to grow but New York City was having a difficult time with the population growth. In the 1860’s reformers began to believe that if public transit improved people who had the means could move out of the city. While reformers began to advocate for improving transit, “ the vision of rapid transit as a means to improve the daily lives of working-class families and protect public health and safety was not to be achieved for more than fifty years” (Derrick 2001). It is not surprising that a project of this scale would take so long to come to fulfillment. 

==Main Markets==

===The first few years===

When reformers first thought of improving transit to move people it was related to issues of overcrowding. The subway was first created to help move the population around so the tenements would not be so crowded. Prior to the subway workers had to live within walking or easy travel distance so that they could easily get to work. When the first line opened it carried “short-haul” passengers around Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn and was very popular right from the beginning (Derrick 2001).

===Now===

The subway continues to be a large part of the public transit networks. The subway provides 24 hour a day service to the boroughs it serves. According to the MTA’s fugures it has the largest rolling stock number in the world.  All this means that the market for the subway is quite large. Commuters, tourists, and others enjoy the services provided by MTA and that is why they continue to expand. (MTA)

===Technology===

The first subway to be operated electric opened in the 1890’s in London. At this time technology was consistently improving in all manners and New York was quick to research all the new technologies available. Electricity and developments in motors, braking, and other advances were quickly improving the efficiency and safety of subway. (Derrick 2001). They needed the speeds to be improving and technology to be advancing to make the large project worth their while.
At the time it was very important technologies to build the tunnels and operate railways were consistently improving. New York City had many technological and engineering issues they had to work through while completing this project. 

===Subway Cars===

The New York City subway designers had a specific list of considerations when searching for the perfect vehicle to ride on the underground railway. These included:

“High schedule speeds with frequent stops.
Maximum carrying capacity for the subway, especially at times of rush hours, morning and evening.
Maximum strength combined with smallest permissible weight.
Adoption of all precautions calculated to reduce possibility of damage from either the electric circuit or from collisions.
The clearance and length of the local station platforms limited the length of trains, and tunnel clearances the length and width and height of the cars.”(Fordham University 1991). 

After looking at the different options available to them by visiting other railways in the U.S. and overseas they decided upon a car model that would work for their needs and quickly put it into a testing period on a different rail line. Some of the specialized features included steel under frames, emergency brakes, and safety features for any electrical malfunctions that might occur. Safety and efficiency were definitely the driving goals in the design and building of these cars. 

===Tunneling Technology===

Another technological feat for this project was the development of the tunnels for the railway. While this was not the first underground subway in the world, London was before them, there was still a lot of work to be put into tunnels. Much of the route already had a considerable amount of stuff under the roadway that needed to be worked around. Due to the placement of the tunnel buildings, pipes and ducts, and more had to be redone to successfully build the tunnels (Fordham University 1991) They were also trying to cause as little disruption as possible to the roads and piping and therefore kept learning about and improving on construction practices while building. 

==Policy==

As New York was rapidly growing from immigration movement in the 19th century there was a significant market for those trying to move out of the tenement slums. Overcrowding in the neighborhoods and on the current public transit systems made it so that they needed to create rapid transit much earlier than they did. By the time the Subway was first opened in the early 1900’s the market they had built for was ready to move outward and use the new form of transit. While the opening was able to allow people to move outward from the densest area it did not stop the continued rise in New York’s population. New York at that time had the most crowded population in the world. People were still immigrating from Europe and rural areas and therefore as soon as the subway opened it was already overcrowded and in need of expansion. (Derrick 2001) 

===Creation of Interborough Rapid Transit===

When the idea of the subway was first considered there were many groups interested in the policy and politics of the line development. One of the largest barriers to construction was the financial cost of the project. The elevated lines in use nearby were nowhere as costly to build as the estimated construction costs that would be needed to develop the subway. There were many different opinions on who should own, who should pay, who is in charge, etc. In the late 1890’s with some help of a private investor the money and approval finally came through. It was at that time that the Interborough Rapid Transit Company was created to be in charge of the line. (Derrick 2001)

===Line Expansion===

Before the first lines were even completed they were already arguing about how to expand the system to reach a larger market and further lessen congestion. According to Derrick, “ How to proceed with the expanding rapid transit network became the biggest political issue in New York during the 1905 and 1909 municipal elections” ( Derrick 2001). At the time there was rapid transit being developed in Brooklyn and then the Manhattan to Bronx line. The Rapid Transit Board wanted to develop a plan that could be implemented as resources became available for the project. The main goal of all lines was to lessen overcrowding in the tenement neighborhoods. There was also a desire to connect the Brookln Rapid Transit Company (BRT) lines with the Interborough Rapid Transit (IRT) lines. 

==The Subway in the 2000s==

===Declining Revenue===

For as long as the Subway has been around there have been issues arising over how to pay for it. During the spring of 2008 Metropolitan Transit Agency (MTA) raised fares so they could make needed improvements to the subway. Shortly after announcing the fare increase would go to specific announced improvements they had to take it back because the finances of the agency were not stable enough to go ahead with the plans. (Neuman 2008) At that time the city was experiencing declining income from the recession and feeling the effect that the layoffs were having on the budget. One way proposed to pay for the improvements was through a congestion pricing policy being enacted in New York. As the New York Times article writes, there was a negative reaction to this idea and a congestion-pricing plan was not pursued past the planning stage. 

===Line expansions===

In the mid 2000’s, the MTA looked at and began plans for expanding several lines that were reaching their limit of passenger carrying capacity. The Second Ave Subway expansion has been in the process of being done for several years. The project is expensive but will allow a much higher volume of passengers. The project even before construction was awarded an Environmental Protection Agency award for the sustainability of the design. It will use some newer techniques to make the expansion less damaging to the environment and have lower energy costs. (Binns 2004) Environmental impact is important in an expansion of this size and therefore should be seen favorably by transit riders and those concerned with the environment. They might save money by the design more cost effective but they are also benefiting by the positive press associated with green design efforts. 

===Improving Technology===

Going off of the green design in the planning of the expansions we might add that New York has also experimented with the use of solar panels on some station roofs. “It will provide a maximum of 65 percent of the station’s electricity during sunny summer days and an average of 15 percent over the course of a year” (Hansen 2005). That station, which operates 24 hours a day, can save money and promote the environment to try and attract visitors to that station. MTA has also tried to make other improvements to make riding the subway easier and more enjoyable to ride. According to the MTA webpage 90% of trips made on the subway now are made with the MetroCard. The card is used as a stored value card that riders can use to ride subways or buses. Also in recent years there have been improvements so that “All subway cars and buses are air-conditioned and either new, remanufactured, or overhauled” (MTA) The improving technology and upgrades to the stations and trains will hopefully continue to improve ridership.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Fear the disappearance of Engineering Education'''''

===DIY U by Anya Kamenetz quotes===
:&quot;The face to face experience, like a live concert, remains valuable as one item on an expanding menu.&quot; 
:&quot;Research shows hybrid beats online only and class only approaches.&quot; 
:&quot;Learners .. publish portfolios of meaningful work that help jobs find them.&quot; 
:&quot;Higher Ed provides .. content, skills, socialization and accreditation. The web can make each of these more accessible, higher quality and even free.&quot;

===MOOC===
Massive Open Online Courses ([[:wikipedia:Massive_open_online_course|MOOCs]]) are going to disrupt higher education as we know it.

===Introduction to Engineering===
The course introduction to engineering can be a model for future face to face education and all other engineering courses. Engineers don't take a course in shovels. Yet aren't English and math such courses? What makes engineering courses unique? Where did the &quot;typing class&quot; go? The course &quot;Introduction to Engineering&quot; is the only course where face to face components are absolutely necessary. This paper is about learning to use a shovel only when digging holes. It is about recognizing problems of the world, not individuals. 

Edison created the first quadrature telegraph mux; solved the powered telephone transmission problem; created the first music recording/playing device; created the light bulb and electricity distribution infrastructure; and created the created the first 35mm film camera. So do freshman engineering students. Freshman engineering students want to change the world too. Let them.

===Student Support Service Bloat===
Schools have moved way beyond protecting fingers from damage. Today education is capturing and holding onto every possible social improvement in a bewildering mosaic that is crowding out engineering, creating a nation addicted to education and turning first year engineering courses into personal growth seminars. Some call Academic Support Services, &quot;Faculty Harassment Service.&quot; Academic Support Service bloat is the major cost of tuition bloat (DIY U page 53). Here is the evidence:
*Clean engineering project space (rather than cluttered mess of creative in-progress engineering)
*Must write objectives, assignments on the board
*Must accommodate infinite variety of special needs 
*Trash, recycling, cleaning, tool safety inspection
*When door to classroom can be open, door stop confiscation
*Four types of Disaster drills practiced regularly
*Fear of student escalation
*Soda brand drinking enforcement
*Parking lot vagabond prevention
*Airspace enforcement, no parachutes, kites, quadcopters, UAVs or weather balloons
*Beautiful facilities, no playing in fountains, no antennas on the roof, no parachutes dropped from the parking garage, no zip lines, no parking spaces for projects
*Centralized Video Camera control
*Work Study, Student Government, Purchasing, Service Learning
*Disneyland line management throttle 
*Speaker competition, 
*Fund raising pre-approval, 
*Project Funding Accountability Expansion
*Scholarship, Internship, Mentorship fairness
*External, non-engineering project approval to prevent &quot;boys and toys&quot; appearance
Faculty use to have voice. Now they have 10 month contracts. Service opportunities turn into control points.

      <comment>/* Bill Me Later: A PayPal Service */ Fix heading formatting</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">If you are bored of paying for purchases the old fashion way you can use PayPal to pay for the purchases. PayPal is an electronic service that takes your purchases from either your Debit or Credit Card. In order to use the service you need to register for an account at www.paypal.com. Once you have registered an account you can log in at any time to add funds, edit your preferences, and keep track of your orders by viewing them from the history tab. You can link multiple funding sources to your account so if you are low in one account they will automatically take the funds from the other source that you have listed. More businesses in today’s market will only allow PayPal because it is a reliable source to make your purchases. I have been using the site for several years and always have received notifications through my email stating the purchase was paid and will be shipped shortly.

[[File:PayPal logo.svg|thumb|PayPal logo]]

As a middleman financial broker, PayPal makes its profit by charging a percentage of the money it transfers for you. PayPal is free for buyers and for sending money to someone else. Once a buyer sets up a PayPal account, then it costs nothing to send money to a seller. The funds are withdrawn from the user’s credit card or bank account. PayPal commonly charges money receivers (sellers) a 30 cent fee + (1.9% to 2.9%) surcharge.  PayPal only charges you to receive funds. If you are sending money to a friend or a family member (someone who is not a registered seller), you can opt to pay the PayPal fee yourself.

===Bill Me Later: A PayPal Service===
Do you like shopping online? And, sometimes there's not enough money in the account for PayPal service.  Now there's no need to worry because you can buy now and pay later through Bill Me Later a PayPal service.  Bill me later is a payment method offered on many merchant's websites, such as Wal-Mart, Petco, eBay and other merchant's sites.  Bill Me Later allows you to shop online with a merchant that's part of Bill Me Later service without putting in any credit card information. You enter your birthdate, and last four digits of your social security number. Bill Me Later is subject to credit approval.  There's no interest if balanced is paid in full in six months.  Bill Me Later is like a credit card, and just like any credit card the consumer must use it responsibly.  Bill Me Later was acquired by eBay in 2008, and operates as a subsidiary of eBay.  Bill Me Later is a way to online shopping.

===PayPal Security===

If you use PayPal as many do there is a way to add security to your account.
The Federal and state laws allow you to restrict what information is shared by the site.
Beware you can’t stop all information from being shared but there are specific parts that can be restricted.  If you go into your account and uncheck the box in the Information Sharing section, you can prevent companies like Ebay from using your information for the marketing of their products.  This page can be accessed by going under the Profile subtab under the My Account tab.
You can control how PayPay uses your contact information for marketing as well in the notifications preferences.

===Pay Pal: Digital Wallet===

On March 13, 2012, PayPal will announce it's re-imagined consumer experience.  This marks the first time in PayPal's 
13-year history that they have completely redesigned and re-architected the PayPal wallet to make money work better in today’s rapidly evolving, multi-channel shopping environment.

Because PayPal’s wallet is digital, and not just mobile, it lets consumers do things with their money that have never been possible before.  And there’s no finite set of features, because the digital wallet can evolve with the pace of innovation, allowing PayPal to incorporate new functionality as consumer demands shift.

According to Sam Shrauger, Vice President, Global Product &amp; Experience, PayPal, ' &quot;this is what we will make possible with the new PayPal:&quot; '

' &quot;Separating the purchase from the payment: Buy something in a store, take it home and decide later how you want to pay for it. PayPal is the only wallet that will offer a 5-7 day grace period for consumers to change their minds. Switch from one funding source to another;decide to pay over time in installments;apply different sources of value (gift cards, airline miles, loyalty points, etc.)&quot; '.

' &quot;Personal Lists: Search for items, compare prices and create lists of things you want to buy for a variety of situations&quot; '.

' &quot;Found Money: Your wallet will find deals and coupons for items on your personal lists once you’re in the store. Forgot about that coupon you were saving? The PayPal wallet won’t&quot; '. 

' &quot;Spending Rules. Create specific “set asides” like travel funds, set rules by purchase amount, tie specific payment instruments to specific merchants – all in your wallet, without setting up any new bank accounts or opening any new credit cards&quot; '.

Furthermore, Shrauger goes on to say, ' &quot; . . . examples in everyday life would be:let’s say I want to combine the value of 10,000 airline miles with a $100 gift card to pay for the new TV I just bought.  There’s no way I can do that right now – but the PayPal wallet will. Or what if I want my money to automatically filter into separate “funds” – one for groceries, one for travel, one for entertainment – when I get my paycheck every week.  Then, at the grocery store check out, the payment is automatically pulled from the fund I’ve earmarked as grocery money.  Sometimes I need to make a big purchase that I’d like to pay for in installments – but do not want to put it on credit. If I pay with PayPal, the retailer gets paid upfront by PayPal, but my money will be deducted in equal installments over time. This flexibility with your own money has never been possible before in the digital world. PayPal is not about replacing a card swipe with a phone tap at point of sale. We are reimagining money to free it in its digital form so that it can work better for everyone&quot; '.

====Static array for one color====
Code in [[C]] for creating pgm text file : 
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(){
  int iX,iY;
  const int iXmax = 300; 
  const int iYmax = 300;
  /* color  is coded from 0 to 255 */
  /* it is 8 bit color RGB file */
  const int MaxColorComponentValue=255; 
  FILE * fp;
  char *filename=&quot;m.pgm&quot;;
  char *comment=&quot;# this is my new text pgm file &quot;;  /* comment should start with # */
  static unsigned char color;
        
        
        
  /*create new file,give it a name and open it in text mode  */
  fp= fopen(filename,&quot;w&quot;); /*  text mode */
  /*write ASCII header to the file*/
  fprintf(fp,&quot;P2\n%s\n%d %d\n%d\n&quot;,comment,iXmax,iYmax,MaxColorComponentValue);
  /*write image data bytes to the file*/
  for(iY=0;iY&lt;iYmax;++iY){
    for(iX=0;iX&lt;iXmax;++iX){         
      color=150;   /* compute  pixel color (8 bit = 1 byte) */
      fprintf(fp,&quot; %d &quot;, color);   /*write color to the file*/
    }
    fprintf(fp,&quot; \n &quot;);
  }
  fclose(fp);
  printf(&quot;OK\n&quot;);
  getchar();
  return 0;
}

&lt;/source&gt;

To compile it : 

   gcc m.c

To run it : 
 ./a.out

Remember that :
* fwrite is used for binary files
* fprintf is used for binary and text files
so if you want to use fwrite then you will get binary file ( even if you will open it in text mode ):

====Static 2D array for whole image====
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(){

  int iX,iY;
  const int iXmax = 100; 
  const int iYmax = 100;
  unsigned char data[iYmax][iXmax]; /* 2D array for colors ( shades of gray ) */
  const int MaxColorComponentValue=255; /* color component is coded from 0 to 255 ;  it is 8 bit color file */
  FILE * fp;
  char *filename=&quot;n.pgm&quot;;
  char *comment=&quot;# this is my new binary pgm  file&quot;;/* comment should start with # */
        
  /* fill the data array */
  for(iY=0;iY&lt;iYmax;++iY){  
    for(iX=0;iX&lt;iXmax;++iX){ 
      data[iY][iX]=255;
    }
  }
}
        
/* write the whole data array to ppm file in one step */      
fp= fopen(filename,&quot;wb&quot;); /*create new file,give it a name and open it in binary mode  */
fprintf(fp,&quot;P5\n %s\n %d %d\n %d\n&quot;,comment,iXmax,iYmax,MaxColorComponentValue);  /*write header to the file*/
fwrite(data,sizeof data,1,fp);  /*write image data bytes to the file*/
fclose(fp);
printf(&quot;OK - file %s saved\n&quot;, filename);
return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====Virtual 2D array and dynamic 1D array ====

Here image is a virtual 2D array, but in program we use 1D array.

Relations between indexes :
 i = ix + iy*iWidth; // index of 1D array 
 ix = i % iWidth;
 iy = (i- ix) / iWidth;
 
Here is whole program where we only check ranges of array's indexes without using explicit array : 

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

/* --------- global variables ----------------- */

// 2D array 
// Indexes of array starts from 0 not 1 
unsigned int ix, iy;
unsigned int ixMin = 0;
unsigned int ixMax = 3; //
unsigned int iWidth ; // = (ixMax -ixMin + 1) = 4
unsigned int iyMin = 0;
unsigned int iyMax = 3; //
unsigned int iHeight ; //= (iyMax -iyMin + 1) =  4
// The size of array has to be a positive constant integer 
unsigned int i2Dsize ; // = iWidth*iHeight = 16


// 1D array 
unsigned int i; // index of 1D array
unsigned int iMin = 0;
// Indexes of array starts from 0 not 1 so the highest elements of an array is = array_name[size-1].
unsigned int iMax ; // = i2Dsize-1; // = 15
// The size of array has to be a positive constant integer 
unsigned int i1Dsize ; // = i2Dsize  = (iMax -iMin + 1) = 16 ;  1D array with the same size as 2D array



/* ---------- functions ----------------*/

/* gives position of 2D point (iX,iY) in 1D array  ; uses also global variable iWidth */
unsigned int f(unsigned int ix, unsigned int iy)
{ return ix + iy*iWidth; }


/* ---------------------- main ------------------*/
int main()
{

iWidth = (ixMax -ixMin + 1); // 
iHeight = (iyMax -iyMin + 1); //
i2Dsize = iWidth*iHeight; // number of points in array 
iMax = i2Dsize-1; // Indexes of array starts from 0 not 1 so the highest elements of an array is = array_name[size-1].
i1Dsize = i2Dsize; // 1D array with the same size as 2D array


// first method using 1D index i 
for (i=iMin; i&lt;i1Dsize; ++i) printf(&quot; %d \n&quot;, i ); // from 0 to 15

// second method using 1D index i 
for (i=iMin; i&lt;=iMax ;  ++i) printf(&quot; %d \n&quot;, i ); // from 0 to 15

// check second method using 1D index i
for (i=iMin; i&lt;=iMax ;  ++i)  // i from 0 to 15
 { ix = i % iWidth;
   iy = ( i- ix) / iWidth; // inversion of f function
   printf(&quot; ix = %d ; iy = %d ; i = %d \n&quot;,ix , iy , i );} 

// using 2D indexes :  iy and ix
for(iy=iyMin;iy&lt;=iyMax;++iy)
  for(ix=ixMin;ix&lt;=ixMax;++ix) printf(&quot; ix = %d ; iy = %d ; i = %d \n&quot;, ix, iy, f(ix,iy) );     

return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Special files==

===Dot files===
'''Dot files''' are text files describing graphs in dot language. Example file :

 digraph &quot;BinaryAddingMachine&quot; {
 a [shape=circle]
 b [shape=circle]
  a -&gt; a [label=&quot;1/1&quot;,color=red];
  a -&gt; a [label=&quot;2/2&quot;,color=blue];
  b -&gt; a [label=&quot;1/2&quot;,color=red];
  b -&gt; b [label=&quot;2/1&quot;,color=blue];
 }

This file can be coverted to other formats using command line program dot. For example to svg : 
 dot -Tsvg b.dot -o b.svg


===Parameter files===

* fractint parfiles &lt;ref&gt;[http://chabin.laurent.free.fr/vff/vff.html#Intro%20to%20par%20files A short Introducion to PAR Files by Laurent Chabin]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.julianhaight.com/filmer_instruct.shtml julian haight : filmer instructions]&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;Fractint uses Parameter files to save/restore all options and settings,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nahee.com/spanky/www/fractint/findex.html Fractint doc index]&lt;/ref&gt; required to recreate particular images. The parameters required to describe an image require very little disk space, especially compared with saving the image itself. &quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giant.net.au/users/rupert/par/par2.htm%20 Fractint par files by Rupert Russell]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most important settigs are :
* [[Fractals/Computer_graphic_techniques/2D#Plane|plane description]] - par files 
* fractal type ( formula) - see also frm files
* [[Colors/Color gradient|color gradient]]  - see map files

Example file :

&lt;pre&gt;
{ ; quite good spirals 
  reset=2000 type=mandel passes=1
  corners=-0.6014129278/-0.5990935452/0.427747516/0.429487053
  params=0/0 float=y maxiter=1000 inside=0 outside=15
  distest=1/10/320/200 
  }

&lt;/pre&gt;

To use it :
* Save file to fractint main directory. 
* Run fractint. 
* press 2 key
* press F6 key
* select file


Reset causes Fractint to reset all calculation related parameters to their default values. Non-calculation parameters such as &quot;printer=&quot;, &quot;sound=&quot;, and &quot;savename=&quot; are not affected. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nahee.com/spanky/www/fractint/image_calc_params.html fractint Image Calculation Parameters ]&lt;/ref&gt;The reset=1730 in the parameter file shows that it was created with 17.3 version of Fractint. &lt;ref&gt;[http://mailman.xmission.com/lurker/message/20110727.020825.b4307144.pl.html [Fractint&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; FOTD 27-07-11 (Bad Moon on the Rise [No Rating&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;)]&lt;/ref&gt;

One can made a video from images. For examp

e creating WebM video files using '''[[FFMPEG_An_Intermediate_Guide/image_sequence#Making_a_video_from_an_Image_Sequence|ffmpeg]]''' &lt;ref&gt;[https://mukund.org/ How this video was made by Mukund]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ygingras.net/b/2009/12/mini-fract-0.6 mini-fract in Lisp by Yannick Gingras]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
 ffmpeg -i x%08d.png -r 24 tifa.webm

or  ffmpeg2theora&lt;ref&gt;[[Help:Converting video/ffmpeg2theora|wikibooks help about converting video : ffmpeg2theora]]&lt;/ref&gt;:

 ffmpeg2theora %d.gif --framerate 5 --videoquality 9 -f webm --artist &quot;your name&quot; -o otput.webm 

If you use files '''names''' containing parameter ( here Cx ), then it would be easy to sort files and make video :

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
  char name [10]; /* name of file */
  i = sprintf(name,&quot;%2.7f&quot;,Cx); /* result (is saved in i) but is not used */
  char *filename =strcat(name,&quot;.pgm&quot;); /* new name thru concatenate of  strings  */
&lt;/source&gt;

3.2 Conventions

In developing the freeglut library, we have taken careful steps to ensure consistency in function operation across the board, 
in such a manner as to maintain compatibility with GLUT's behavior whenever possible. In this section some of the important conventions of FreeGLUT, 
and their compatibility with GLUT, are made explicit.

3.2.1 Window placement and size

There is considerable confusion about the &quot;right thing to do&quot; concerning window size and position. GLUT itself is not consistent between Windows and UNIX/X11; 
since platform independence is a virtue for freeglut, we decided to break with GLUT's behaviour. 
Under UNIX/X11, it is apparently not possible to get the window border sizes in order to subtract them off the window's initial position until some time after the window has been created. 
Therefore we decided on the following behavior, both under Windows and under UNIX/X11:

When you create a window with position (x,y) and size (w,h), the upper left hand corner of the outside of the window (the non-client area) is at (x,y) and the size of the drawable (client) area is (w,h). 
The coordinates taken by glutInitPosition and glutPositionWindow, as well as the coordinates provided by FreeGLUT when it calls the glutPositionFunc callback, specify the top-left of the non-client area of the window.
When you query the size and position of the window using glutGet, FreeGLUT will return the size of the drawable area
--the (w,h) that you specified when you created the window
--and the coordinates of the upper left hand corner of the drawable (client) area
--which is NOT the (x,y) position of the window you specified when you created it.

== App Stores ==

== What Are App Stores? ==
An '''App''' is a term to describe a web-based program.  These web-based or mobile applications perform a specific task for the user.  An '''App Store''' is a website where one can download these small programs for use on mobile devices such as a Smart phone, iPod, or Tablet.  The apps can be free or cost a small nominal fee.  Apps are designed to expand the functionality of a mobile device.&lt;ref&gt;www.wisegeek.com.  ''What is an App Store?'' Retrieved October 13, 2011 from:   http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-an-app-store.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Apps can be used for personal or business related activities.


== How Does An App Store Work? ==
People usually access an App store from their mobile device (phone, iPod, tablet).  Apps are usually categorized by the App Store so the user can search for an app more easily.  Once the desired App is located in the App Store, the user can download, either for free or by purchasing them, an app onto a mobile device.  The App can then be opened and used on the mobile device.  


== Examples of App Stores ==
Currently there are five major App Stores:

'''Apple''' – The market leader in Apps – http://www.apple.com/mac/app-store/

'''Android Market''' - https://market.android.com/?hl=en

'''Blackberry App World''' - http://us.blackberry.com/apps-software/appworld/

'''Palm/HP App Catalog''' - http://www.hp.com/united-states/webos/us/en/apps.html

'''Windows Marketplace''' - http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/marketplace

== Comparisons of App Stores ==

Read online articles that compare the leading App stores:

From MACTrast.com - http://www.mactrast.com/2011/09/app-store-wars-a-visual-comparison-of-mobile-app-stores/

== How App Stores Can Be Used in Education ==

The creation of apps and the App Stores allows educators easy access to complimentary programs that can be used to teach students about specific content areas.  Many different Apps exist that provide the ability to create stories, newspapers, simulations, scavenger hunts, and real-life solutions to only name a few.  Technology has enabled the use of Apps to be used in the classroom by using devices such as an iPod&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apple.com/ipod/&lt;/ref&gt;, iPad&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apple.com/ipad/&lt;/ref&gt;, or a Smart Phone&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia – The Free Encyclopedia.  Smartphone.  Retrieved October 13, 2011 from:  [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone]]&lt;/ref&gt;.  Using this type of technology increases student engagement, participation, and excitement about the material being taught.  Using apps purchased through App Stores enhances the learning environment for teachers and students.

Apps can be used in all subject areas, grade levels, and by all of the different levels of students.  They can be used for personal organization, collaborative and visual thinking, and to promote creativity.  There is a possibility of saving money by using apps instead of spending money on other costs like educational textbooks and software, going on field trips, expensive supplies and research materials, content expert fees, etc.

Apple&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apple.com www.apple.com]&lt;/ref&gt; is the leading App Store and the industry leader for educational apps [7].

{{wikipedia|Quadrics}}
Quadrics are a way to create simple shapes, such as spheres or cylinders, from their maths equations.

Quadrics are usually drawn using the GLU (OpenGL Utility) library.  In this tutorial though, we target portability, in particular mobile devices, where GLU may just not be available, or only for OpenGL 1.x, so we'll implement it ourselves.  In addition we've get a better understanding than merely call of few functions :)

We can draw quadrics differently:
* solid / wireframe
* front-facing on the outside / on the inside

= Solving the equation =

So you might ask &quot;How on earth am I going to solve a THREE variables equations???&quot;.  Well, the answer is to define x and y, using a grid, and compute z.

There are two main ways to draw a grid for x and y values:
* square grid: make N points along the x axis, and for each of them, make M points along the y axis. This is a classic double-for loop as used with 2-dimensional C arrays.
* disk grid: define a circle radius N times, and compute M points on the circle (using cos/sin).
Both methods will produce different results visually.

When solving the equation, we'll meet two forms:
* &lt;math&gt;z = EQUATION&lt;/math&gt; : z is computed directly
* &lt;math&gt;z^2 = EQUATION&lt;/math&gt; : there are 3 cases:
** EQUATION is 0, and there's one solution (0)
** EQUATION is negative, and there's no solution
** otherwise, z has two solution, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\sqrt{EQUATION}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle-\sqrt{EQUATION}&lt;/math&gt;

= Sphere =

Equation : &lt;math&gt;{x^2 \over a^2} + {y^2 \over a^2} + {z^2 \over a^2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

So : &lt;math&gt;z^2 = a^2 - {x^2} - {y^2}&lt;/math&gt;

So we have two z solutions for each (x,y) point (except when z = 0).

      <comment>/* Complex Power Function */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;br /&gt;
Cpow is library function in [[C programming]] language, useful to calculate power of a number raised to complex number.&lt;br /&gt;
It is the feature added to C programming language by 1999 standard i.e. C99.
== Complex Power Function ==
===Introduction ===
In [[mathematics]], complex number is denoted by 'z' .
    z = x + iy
In this number 'x' is the real part and 'y' is imaginary part.
'i' is imaginary unit ,where &quot;i&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = -1 &quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
Complex power is defined by the mathematical operation of exponentiation given by &quot;z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&quot; .&lt;br /&gt;
In [[C programming language]] , library function for this is given by ''Cpow''.&lt;br /&gt;
==== Header File ====
&lt;br /&gt;Standard Library Header file :
[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/C_Reference/complex.h|&lt;complex.h&gt;](complex arithmetic)

==== Syntax for function ====
&lt;source lang =&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  double complex cpow(double complex x, double complex y);
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This function calculates the power of real number  'x' raised to y-th power ,where y is a complex number .&lt;br /&gt;
In mathematics ,by Euler's formula, e&lt;sup&gt;ia&lt;/sup&gt; = (cos a +i sin a).Here,cos and sin are trigonometric functions.&lt;br /&gt;
For x&lt;sup&gt;ia&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;
x&lt;sup&gt;i .a&lt;/sup&gt; = e&lt;sup&gt;i .a ln(x)&lt;/sup&gt; = ( cos(a ln(x)) + i sin(a ln(x)) )  ;  ln  : logarithmic function to the base e.
====Return Value====

    This function shall return the complex power function value.
Returns the complex power of base x raised to the y-th power using the principal branch, whose cuts are along the negative real axis.
=== Usage of Cpow function===
&lt;source lang =&quot;c&quot;&gt;
//Program returns the complex number z3
#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include&lt;complex.h&gt;
#include&lt;math.h&gt;
int main()
{       int x, y, p, q;
        double complex z1, z2, z3; //complex variables declaration
        scanf(&quot;%d %d %d %d&quot;, &amp;x, &amp;y, &amp;p, &amp;q);
        z1 = (p + q * I);
        z2 = (x + y * I);
        z3 = cpow (z2, z1);
        printf(&quot;%f + %f * i\n&quot;, creal(z3), cimag(z3));
        return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;</text>

{{displaytitle|title=Hardware Devices: Secondary storage devices}}
&lt;/NOINCLUDE&gt;
This section will be looking at the various forms of secondary storage devices (media).  For each device you should be familiar with the following details:
* [[w:Seek time|Seek time]] - The average time taken from requesting data to starting to read the requested data
* Capacity - The amount of data it is possible to store on a medium
* Write type - Whether it is read only, write only, or readable and writable
* Cost - How much it costs per megabyte
* Access type - Whether it uses Random Access or Serial Access
[[File:Random vs sequential access.svg|thumb|400px|center|sequential access requires all memory locations before the one sought to be read, before reaching it. Random access memory allows you to jump directly to the memory location you are seeking]]

Pay special attention to devices with an {{Font color||#ff9933|orange}} background, you need to be able to describe exactly how they work!

== Magnetic media ==
[[w:Magnetic storage|Magnetic media]] stores data by assigning a magnetic charge to metal.  This metal is then processed by a read head, which converts the charges into ones and zeros.  Historically, magnetic media has been very popular for storing programs, data, and making backups.  It looks set to continue in this role for some time. However, solid state technology is starting to be used more and more, storing programs and data on new devices such as mobile phones and cameras.

=== {{Font color||#ff9933|Hard disk}} ===
[[File:HardDisk2.ogg|thumb|thumb|Video of exposed hard disk drive (HDD)]]
Hard disks are usually found inside computers to store programs and data.  They are increasingly cheap and more and more companies are using them to back things up.  Hard disks can vary in physical size with some disks getting as small as your thumb. The capacity of a commercial disk is currently up to about 4 terabytes allowing users to read and write to them. They are constructed from several key components:
* '''Platter''' - Metallic disks where One or both sides of the platter are magnetized, allowing data to be stored.  The platter spins thousands of times a second around the spindle.  There may be several platters, with data stored across them
* '''Head''' - The head reads magnetic data from the platter.  For a drive with several platters there may two heads per platter allowing data to be read from top and bottom of each
* '''Actuator Arm''' - used to move the read heads in and out of the disk, so that data can be read and written to particular locations and you can access data in a Random fashion, you don't need to read your way through the entire disk to fetch a particular bit of information, you can jump right there.  Seek time is very low.
* '''Power connector''' - provides electricity to spin the platters, move the read head and run the electronics
* '''IDE connector''' - allows for data transfer from and to the platters
* '''Jumper block''' - used to get the disk working in specific ways such as [[w:RAID|RAID]]
[[File:Hard drive-en.svg|center|400px]]
For the exam you must be able to explain how a hard disk works:
# The platters spin around the spindle
# data is requested to be read from a particular area of a platter
# the actuator arm moves the read head to that track
# Once the data sector that is required has spun around and under the read head, data is read
# Read data is sent from the IDE connector to main memory
[[File:Cylinder Head Sector.svg|thumb|center|400px|Description of a hard disk platter]]
Writing data is very similar:
# The platters spin around the spindle
# data is sent to the hard disk using the IDE connector
# the actuator arm moves the write head to the track that will be written to
# Once the data sector that is required has spun around and under the write head, data is written to the platter

'''Pros'''
{{Plus|Fast seek times}}
{{Plus|Random access}}
{{Plus|High capacities possible}}
{{Plus|Low cost per megabyte}}

'''Cons'''
{{Minus|Very susceptible to damage from physical shocks}}

=== Magnetic Tape drive ===
[[Image:Dds tape drive 01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|DDS tape drive. Above, from left  right: [[w:Digital Data Storage|DDS]]-4 tape (20 GB), 112m [[w:Data8|Data8]] tape (2.5 GB), [[w:Quarter Inch Cartridge|QIC]] DC-6250 tape (250 MB), and a 3.5&quot; [[w:floppy disk|floppy disk]] (1.44 MB)]]
Increasingly obsolete, the tape has been a medium to deliver software and back up data since the early days of computing.  Nowadays they are used mostly for corporate backing up and archiving of data. Tapes are sequential data stores, meaning that if you had information stored at the end of the tape you would have to wind your way through the entirety of the tape before you could read it.  There is no random access like with a hard disk!  Tapes can be several terabytes in size and reading and writing can be very fast as long as you read or write continuous sections of the tape at once.

'''Pros'''
{{Plus|Fast}}
{{Plus|High capacity}}
{{Plus|Cheap per megabyte}}

'''Cons'''
{{Minus|Serial read and write capabilities}}

== Optical media ==

Optical media works by creating a disc with a pitted metallic surface.  There are several different types of disk out there ranging from 650 MB to 128 GB, with the pits and lands getting closer together for higher volume disks.  The principle behind how each of them works is the same.

[[File:CPT Hardware-Secondary-OpticalDrive.svg|thumb|center|400px|close up of the surface of a CD being read]]
A CD-ROM is a metal disc embedded into a plastic protective housing. Each disc has to be 'mastered'; this is the process of creating the CD and placing the data on it. CDs are WORM (Write Once, Read Many) media; this refers to the fact that once they have been mastered, there is no way to change the data on them. 

'''Writing to a CD-ROM'''
# A single track runs in a spiral pattern from the centre of the disc to the outside, this track is made of pits and lands to represent the ones and zeroes of binary data
# A high-powered laser is shone onto the CD-ROM, burning pits into the metal
# The disc spins and the laser follows the track, putting the binary data onto the CD in a spiral track
# The data has been written

'''Reading from a CD-ROM'''
# A single track runs in a spiral pattern from the centre of the disc to the outside, this track is made of pits and lands to represent the ones and zeroes of binary data
# A low-powered laser is shone on the metallic surface and the reflection is captured in a photodiode sensor, the lands reflect differently to the pits, meaning it can tell the difference between a 1 and a 0
# The disc spins and the laser follows the track
# The binary data (the 1s and 0s) are put together and the CD-ROM has been read

'''Pros'''
{{Plus|Cheap}}
{{Plus|Data cannot be written over by the consumer}}

=== {{Font color||#ff9933|CD-R}} ===
The CD-R is made of a reflective metal disk with a layer of (usually green, opaque) dye on top.

'''Writing to a CD-R'''
# A single track runs in a spiral pattern from the centre of the disc to the outside.
# A high-powered laser is shone onto the CD-R, changing the transparency (permanently) of the dye above. The transparent and opaque parts represent binary 1s and 0s

'''Writing to a CD-RW'''
# A single track runs in a spiral pattern from the centre of the disc to the outside.
# A high-powered laser is shone onto the CD-ROM. Depending on whether this is very high powered or heats at a slightly lower temperature, the top layer of metal cools differently. These will result in different amounts of reflectivity, which represent the 1s and 0s.

USB Flash drives are solid state, that means that there are no moving parts.  This is very useful for seek times as we don't have to wait for mechanical movement, meaning seek time is very low and it allows for fast Random Access Memory.  Flash drives can be set to read only mode, but they will always allow for reading and writing.  The size of flash drives is not as great as a Hard Disk and they are generally much more expensive per megabyte

# put drive into USB socket
# USB driver loads, providing the computer with code on how to read and write from the USB
# The USB is read, giving information on the file and folder structure (File Allocation Table) to the Computer
# [Reading] The user chooses to open a file, the Computer sends the address wanted to the USB port
# [Reading] The USB returns the data at the location requested
# [Writing] The computer sends data to the USB port where it is place into empty space on the drive
# [Writing] The computer then requests a new version of the file and folder structure

'''Pros'''
{{Plus|Very fast seek times}}
{{Plus|Very portable}}

'''Cons'''
{{Minus|Limited capacity}}
{{Minus|expensive per MB when compared to Hard Disks}}

=== Memory cards ===
Work in much the same way as a Flash drive and can often be converted into Flash Drives.  They have different connectors and are generally smaller than USB Flash drives allowing for them to be used in cameras, mobile phones and game consoles.

You should already have met the internal components of the computer and the peripherals, that sit outside.  We are now going to look at two different categories of peripherals.  Those that '''input''' data into a computer, and those that '''output''' data from the computer.
[[File:CPT Hardware-InputOutput.svg|thumb|center|Computers work along the lines shown above, they receive inputs (instructions etc.), they process the input working out what to do with it, then they output some form of result]]
How do we tell what is an input and what is an output device?  Think about it from the computer's perspective.  If a device is putting data into the computer in the form of text, sound, images, button presses etc. then it is an input device, if the device is outputting things from the computer such as sound, movement, printing, images etc., then it is an output device.  It really is that easy to tell the difference, but be warned, some devices can be both input and output!

Let's take a look at two examples:
{{CPTExample|title=Example: Telling the difference between input and output devices}}
[[File:LG L194WT-SF LCD monitor.jpg|thumb|center|An LG LCD monitor]]
When you are using the monitor it displays things that you are doing, such as moving windows and clicking on website links.  At no point do you click on the screen or put anything into the monitor.  The only thing it does is output information, therefore it is an output device.  Easy!
[[File:5 Tastenmaus Microsoft IntelliMouse Optical Black.jpg|thumb|center|An optical mouse]]
A mouse is used to move a little cursor around the screen, clicking and dragging as you go.  if you let go of the mouse, the cursor will stop.  The computer is relying on you to move the mouse, the mouse won't move on its own! Therefore it is an input device.

&lt;small&gt;This fact sheet has been written for those people suffering or affected by osteoarthritis. It provides background information of osteoarthritis and the current treatment and prevention strategies, more specifically resistance training for treatment and prevention. This fact sheet also provides details on where to find further information on osteoarthritis.&lt;/small&gt;

=== What is osteoarthritis (OA)? ===
&lt;small&gt;'''Osteoarthritis''' (OA) is the most common form of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis arthritis]. It is a chronic joint disorder that is the most common cause of joint pain and joint disability. It is characterised by the break down of joint [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage cartilage] that usually protects the bones joints allowing it to move freely. The joints that are more commonly affected are the spine, hands, hips and knees. In OA, the breakdown of joint cartilage leaves the bones exposed and unprotected resulting in damage that decreases the joints ability to move freely. Accompanying the loss of movement is a decreased ability to carry out daily tasks and normal living, resulting in a decreased quality of life for the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Jamtvedt, G, Dahm, KT, Christie, A, Moe, RH, Haavardsholm, E, Holm, &amp; Hagen KB 2008 ‘Physical Therapy Interventions for Patients With Osteoarthritis of the Knee: An Overview of Systematic Reviews’, Physical Therapy, vol. 88, pp. 123-136. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17986496&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

=== What are the symptoms of OA? ===
&lt;small&gt;The symptoms of OA can vary between sufferers. The symptoms that you experience will sometimes depend on which joints are causing you discomfort. The development of OA is a progressive disease, usually over several months or several years. Joint pain and stiffness are the most common complaints from sufferers of OA. You may experience over symptoms such as a reduction in range of movement (ROM), decrease muscle mass (muscle atrophy), joint swelling and physical disability. These symptoms may become worse when you are inactive for extended periods of time, such as driving for long periods of time. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthritisaustralia.com.au/images/stories/documents/info_sheets/english/colour/template_Osteoarthritis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthritis.org/media/newsroom/media-kits/Osteoarthritis_fact_sheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthritis.org/media/newsroom/media-kits/Osteoarthritis%20fact%20sheet%20from%20AF-Final%2012_10_09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

=== What are the risk factors of OA? ===
&lt;small&gt;The cause of OA is not yet clear, but research shows that there are certain factors that increase the risk of developing OA in certain joints, these include:
* knees: previous injuries, occupation e.g. carpet layers, being overweight, repeated overuse, muscle weakness due to minimal physical activity, genetics and aging. 
* hips: previous injuries, occupation e.g. removalist, being overweight and aging. 
* hands: previous injuries, heredity, repeated overuse and aging.
&lt;/small&gt;

=== What are the chances I develop OA? ===
[[File:Osteoarthritis world map - DALY - WHO2004.svg|thumb|right|alt=Example alt text|Age-standardised disability-adjusted life year (DALY) rates from Osteoarthritis by country (per 100,000 inhabitants).]]
&lt;small&gt;The chances of you developing OA increases with age. Research shows 5% of the entire population below 40 are affected by OA, this increases dramatically to 10% of males and 20% of females aged 45–65 years, and then further to affect more than 50% of women aged 85 years and over. 
OA can not only affect you via the cost of medicines and surgery but may affect you indirectly, such as loss of income, lost productivity, pain, disability, emotional impairment, impaired social function and other health-related quality of life issues. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/4823.0.55.001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/AD383BF1A9E16D5BCA25711A007AF405/$File/evid4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/180_05_010304/mar10381_fm.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

=== What are the treatment and prevention for OA? ===
&lt;small&gt;The overall goal, since there is no cure, is to reduce pain, improve overall function of the joints that are affected and more importantly eliminate the risks of you developing OA. You can meet these goals through the following methods of intervention:
* Pharmacological - drug therapy, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate and paracetamol for pain relief.
* Non-Pharmacological – exercise therapy, such as '''resistance training''' for muscle strengthening, [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:J_griffin/Osteoarthritis_and_Aerobic_Exercise aerobic training] for weight loss.
* Surgical - joint replacement surgery, usually the last option if the symptoms can no longer be controlled by pharmacological and non-pharmacological preventions and treatments.&lt;/small&gt;

==== What is resistance training and how does it help? ====
&lt;small&gt;Resistance training is any exercise that causes your muscles to contract against a resistance. The expectation is an increase in strength, tone, mass, and/or endurance for muscle and bone. It has been reported that exercise, predominantly [http://www.dynamicstrength.com/ dynamic strengthening exercises], provides benefits for pain and function of patients suffering from knee and hip OA. 
Activities that are likely to be good for your fitness include walking, swimming, water exercise, low-impact aerobics, and riding a bike or exercise bike. Your physiotherapist can also suggest specific exercises and stretches that are appropriate for your situation.&lt;ref&gt;Maura Daly Iversen, Therapeutic Advances in Musculoskeletal Disease 2010 2: 279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taking Control of your Osteoarthritis, Arthritis Australia, http://www.arthritisaustralia.com.au/images/stories/documents/booklets/2011_updates/Taking_control_of_your_Ostoarthritis_booklet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

==== What resistance exercises can I do to help?====
&lt;small&gt;Below you will find a list of exercises you can complete at home on a regular basis that will help you prevent and manage the onset of OA. These exercises are targeted at strengthening the muscles surrounding the hip and knee joints which are common sites affected by OA. They will help in reducing pain, increasing movement of the joint and increasing your ability in the gait cycle (walking).&lt;/small&gt;

(Note: References still being formatted)

The Train à Grande Vitesse, or TGV, which means High-Speed Train in English, is the French name for their high-speed rail (HSR) service in France. First connecting Paris to Lyon in 1981, the TGV was the first large-scale builder of HSR service in Europe, second in the world only to Japan’s Shinkansen. Today, the TGV network in France comprises nearly 2100 kilometers of track, with many more planned over the next few decades. 

==Introduction==

High-speed rail as we regard it today was first developed by Japan in the construction of their Shinkansen network. The Shinkansen utilized a separate rail infrastructure exclusively built for high-speed passenger service. This was done in part to provide the greatest safety to the trains and passengers and maximize efficiency. The 515-kilometer link from Tokyo to Osaka was designed to be flat and straight, which required many tunnels, bridges, and elevated section. This design approach led to significant cost overruns - double the original estimate - for the first Shinkansen line. &lt;ref name =&quot;hs2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gourvish |first1=Terry |year=1 March 2010 |title=The High Speed Rail Revolution: History and Prospects |publisher=Department of Transport (UK) |url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/rail/pi/highspeedrail/hs2ltd/historyandprospects/pdf/report.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate= 7 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trains developed for the Shinkansen were designed to be lighter and less crash prone than their conventional counterparts. The lightweight nature of the trains reduced energy consumption and wear of the rails, thereby reducing operating and maintenance expenses. Electric overhead power provided the ability for trains to accelerate and decelerate quickly. A similar design approach was utilized in the development of the TGV.

Many advantages exist between the TGV and other modes of travel. The TGV provides arguably the best option for medium distance travel between major European cities, beating out the car in terms of travel time, and competitive with airlines in terms of travel time and ease of accessibility. Its success has shown over time that its speed and connectivity between major urban centers has made it a significant player in business and leisure travel. Additionally, energy consumption on the TGV is considerably lower than using a car or flying, which reduces operating expenses relating to travel. Since many of the high-demand, low-investment routes have already been constructed in France, expansion of the rail network is becoming increasingly difficult to justify. However, as the European Union attempts to elicit greater connection and competition between HSR service in different countries, the growth of the French network may continue for many years ahead.

==Before the TGV==

===Existing modes===

Prior to the development of the TGV network, three main options existed for those wishing to travel across France: conventional rail travel, automobile, and air travel. As the first TGV line opened was the 470-km Paris to Lyon route, this document will frequently on this link to compare different travel modes.

Conventional rail and the automobile both offered similar journey times prior to 1981. The drive between Paris and Lyon takes  approximately 4 hours 30 minutes, compared to 4 hours by conventional passenger rail. The advantages of the train included a modest time savings and freedom to engage in other activities. Highly-taxed petrol in Europe may deter people from driving, in addition to difficulties driving and parking in central area, but auto use provided greater flexibility and versatility in delivering travellers directly from their origin to their destination. Travelers choosing to fly could travel between the cities in only 75 minutes (excluding airport travel time and security). With these mode options, conventional rail competed more closely with the automobile, and high-speed travel was limited to air travel. 

===Limitations of existing modes===

There were growing limitations with each mode in the run-up to the TGV. Auto congestion is a typical problem of most major metropolitan areas. Furthermore, auto travel is usually limited for trips up to 200 km before other modes are considered. The conventional passenger rail service between Paris-Lyon route was at or near maximum capacity, and the service and infrastructure were not well-regarded &lt;ref name =&quot;hs2&quot;/&gt;. The the numerous flights between short-haul markets compounded congestion in airports for long and short-haul flights alike. Furthermore, since the two airports are not centrally located, and are not typically a destination in themselves, traveling by car or train is common among air travelers, particularly for those traveling to smaller cities and towns outside Paris and Lyon. Ultimately, greater capacity was needed to deliver passengers between the two cities, and to destinations beyond. &lt;ref name =&quot;hs2&quot;/&gt;

===New possibilities===

The development of the HSR network has been a part of the French Government’s efforts to modernize the rail network since WWII. This goal was inspired in large part by the success of Japan’s Shinkansen line. In 1976, France’s nationally owned rail company SNCF released their master plans, Objectif 2000, with a Paris-Lyon link being the first line to open.
The development of the train borrowed heavily from the Shinkhansen, with improvements focused on providing a train capable of being fast, safe, and reliable. Making the train lightweight was essential to providing a high power to weight ratio, which is important in delivering high-speed service. Stability was very important as well from a safety and comfort perspective. Rails on exclusive TGV tracks are carefully joined to eliminate the rythmic gallup typical of trains. Trains today are able to travel at speeds of 320 kph without making a glass of wine wobble. &lt;ref name =&quot;economist&quot;&gt; {{cite journal |year=7 July 2007 |title=A high-speed revolution |journal=Economist |volume= 384|issue=8536 |pages=61-62 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By implementing a staggered approach to network development, France learned from Japan’s financial troubles in developing a solely exclusive railway network. The TGV between Paris and Lyon was opened incrementally along existing, but upgraded, rail infrastructure, and eventually on exclusive rail infrastructure. By avoiding the need to build a completely separate rail infrastructure, France avoided some of the initial capital investments that Japan faced in the development of their separate HSR alignment. France’s decision to initially mix their high-speed system with existing rail infrastructure differs from other countries besides Japan. In Spain, new HSR infrastructure is being built to standard gauge track, whereas older conventional track was built at a non-standard gauge. This mixed gauge track issues has been resolved, but only with the development in recent years of gauge-changing technology. In Germany, their high-speed, conventional, and freight trains are all fully mixed in the system, meaning all trains are able to use the same track [hs2] which may create greater potential for delays and congestion.

France would ultimately build rail infrastructure exclusively for the TGV trains. However, while Japan designed a flat, straight track between Tokyo and Osaka, SNCF realized that with fast, lightweight, high powered trains, they could actually build rail at grades in excess of those typically allowed on heavy conventional rail. The construction of separate HSR infrastructure could then be built to more closely follow the topography of the land, significantly reducing earthwork costs. As a result, capital rail improvements for TGV lines are typically among the lowest in the world. [hs2]

The pricing structure that SNCF followed was based on a demand-based model. The TGV followed the yield management system adopted by airlines that varied prices based on the demand of a particular train based on its departure time and destination, and was the first rail company in Europe to do so. Implementing this profit-maximizing policy for the TGV from the beginning was essential to its success, and would have been more difficult to implement later on. [mr]

==TGV Sud-Est - Connecting Paris and Lyon==

The TGV Sud-Est from Paris to Lyon was decided upon as the inaugural route for the TGV. The first phase of the line opened in 1981, and the second phase opened in 1983. Investment was made initially where it was most greatly needed, and would provide the greatest impact. As the rail network and trains were state-owned, this vertically integrated structure made it easier to provide the funds necessary to develop the network. The congested route between Paris and Lyon was the clear choice, as it served 40% of the French population. The initial aim of the TGV was to attract business and leisure travelers looking that might short-haul flight. It also provides time savings and improved connectivity for existing rail travelers. The modest increase in time to take the TGV was considered palatable since many travelers could connect to conventional or metro train service from the train station, instead of switching modes at the airport on the edge of town.

Furthermore, the energy savings provided by HSR were significant. Whereas travel by plane equates to the equivalent of 7.1 liters of diesel fuel for every 100 passenger-kilometers, and 3.3 liters for auto travel, the TGV only utilizes only 0.7 liters of fuel over the same distance. In addition to the energy and associated cost savings, the reduction in energy consumption (in addition to the fact that the TGV operated on electricity via overhead wires), meant that the effects of air pollution from autos and planes might be significantly reduced.

Deployment of HSR infrastructure along this corridor made rail travel more comparable with air travel than with car travel. The travel time between Paris and Lyon on the TGV Sud-Est line was initially reduced from nearly 4 hours (227 minutes) to 2.5 hours (160 minutes). Further upgrades to the system have brought the travel time down to under 2 hours (115 minutes). [hs2]. Before 1981, modal share for trips between Paris and Lyon were 31% by air, 40% by train, and 29% by car or bus. After 1984, only 7% travel by air, 72% travel by train, and 21% travel by car. TGV now has a 90% share in high-speed service between the two cities, and air travel’s mode share has reduced by over 75%, and automobiles by nearly 30%. Deployment of HSR infrastructure has shifted rail travel to be more comparable with air travel than with car travel.  It is clear that the TGV made significant impacts on they way people travel between these two cities, the greatest impact being in mode shift to TGV from the air travel market [hs2]

==The TGV Network Expands==

The Sud-Est line was a major success for SNCF, and the TGV network continued to expand throughout France throughout the 1980s through the 2000s. The network expanded to Calais in the north, Marseilles in the south, Bordeaux in the southwest, and Strasbourg to the east. By 2010, nearly thirty years after the first TGV line, France had built or upgraded rail lines across 1600 km of France, connecting many of the major cities. The relative low cost of construction of the TGV lines has made the networks quick growth possible. 

The expansion of the TGV network to the far reaches of the country provide opportunities for international connections. The connection to Calais provided an eventual connection to London via the Channel Tunnel, and connections to the northeast toward Brussels and Amsterdam. The original Sud-Est line has expanded toward Marseilles, and continues on to the Spanish border, where TGV service will soon continue uninterrupted to Barcelona. The Haut-Bugey connection, completed in 2010, provides a shortcut for TGV service between Paris and Geneva, and the TGV Est line to Strasbourg will provide service to Germany.

For cross-border travel, train operators were created by multiple state-owned train companies to provide service between international destinations. Thalys International is one company that was created to provide high-speed passenger rail services between Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, and Cologne. Capital ownership of the company is divided amongst SNCF (France), 28% held by the SNCB (Belgium) and 10% held by the DB (Germany). [Thalys]

Eurostar is a similar consortium that provides commercial passenger service between London, Paris, and Brussels. It is operated by a consortium of public and private companies in the UK, France, and Belgium. Eurostar became Eurostar International with its transition from a joint venture between the UK, France, and Belgium to a single corporate entity. [12] [6]

Technological improvements have continued since the TGV first began in 1981. In 1996, TGV unveiled its first double-decker train, which significantly increased capacity (and revenue) along routes that were becoming increasingly congested. Additionally, French trains are continually striving to provide faster service, and have broken rail speed records on numerous occasions. Most recently, a modified TGV train set a new record by reaching a top speed of 574.8 kph in 2007.

Policy changes began taking place in the mid-to-late 1990s with the European Union forcing many state-owned rail companies to split their rail ownership division from their trains operations. In 1997, France broke up SNCF, which controlled both the rail infrastructure and the rolling stock, and created the Réseau Ferré de France (RFF), or the French Railway Network. The RFF was split from SNCF, now simply the train operator, and inherited its debt, in order to make SNCF operationally profitable when train services are opened to privatization. RFF remains a state-owned company, and owns, maintains, and upgrades the rail network throughout France. [13]

==TGV Approaches Maturity==

===Effects of a growing HSR network===

As the TGV and European HSR network expands, it has had significant effects on air service between cities served by HSR. According to SNCF, the point at which more travelers choose air over HSR is at a train trip time of 4.5 hours [mr]. Given the density of the general population and large cities throughout western Europe, this has had significant impact on short haul air travel across Europe. At distances greater than 800 km (or about 3.5 hours travel time by train), air travel begins to take on a majority of the modal share based on current maximum travel speeds by HSR today. But train travel times of 2.5 hours or less show HSR capturing over 80% of the high-speed travel market. [Werner Rothengatter] The advent of HSR in Europe has certainly been detrimental to the airline industry in terms of market share. However, while HSR has been successful in the short-haul, high-speed markets, there are geographical limitations to the extent of a viable HSR network in Europe.

In France, determining the maximum extent of a high-speed rail network length may be helpful for estimating the maximum viable size of the network. As discussed above, the TGV was first deployed between Paris and Lyon. The TGV Sud-Est line provided high-speed access for 40% of the French population between the two largest cities in the country. It was an obvious choice, and perhaps unsurprisingly, quite successful. While the French government has significant leverage to fund the expensive capital investments to infrastructure and rolling stock, as passenger service shifts from SNCF to other carriers with the privatization of the train systems, greater attention will be paid to the return on investment of future service expansion. [hs2] As the network continues to grow, and the network branches out to more distant or less populated areas, or traverses more difficult terrain, subsequent expansion of the system may become difficult to justify. Certainly, there is a limit to the length of economically viable lines that can serve the French countryside.

The TGV network in France in still growing, and has not yet reached maturity, therefore, it is only possible to estimate the maximum value of HSR lines in France. The chart below shows a number of possible scenarios for the maximum extent of cumulative track mileage in France, based on nearly 40 years of completed and planned development of TGV lines. Table 1 shows a timeline of TGV development from 1981 to future lines planned into 2021.  By 2021, there will be approximately 2100 kilometers of high speed rail throughout France. Some estimates suggest that the network may reach 3500 kilometers in total.

===Determining the maximum extent of HSR in France===

What is a reasonable assumption for the maximum extent of rail on the TGV network? Most technologies follow a similar pattern of growth and decline, characterized by an “S-Curve”. This S curve can be represented by the equation

&lt;!-- :&lt;math&gt;S(t) = \frac{K}{1 + e^{-b(t-t&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;}} \! &lt;/math&gt; --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S(t) = \frac{K}{1 + e^{-b(t-to)}} &lt;/math&gt;

Where:

S(t) is the estimated cumulative track length at time t (in years);
t&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the inflection point at which ½ K is achieved;
K is the saturation level of cumulative track length, in kilometers
b is a coefficient that affects the steepness of the curve across time, t.

The data gathered for track length was analyzed using data analysis software in Microsoft Excel 2011. The results of the data are shown below.

[[File:ScurveTGV.jpg|thumb|600px|none|Saturation Level Of France's TGV Network]]

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!K !! 2500 !! 3000 !! 3500 !! 4000 !! 4500
|-
| b || 0.114 || 0.089 || 0.079 || 0.073 || 0.070
|-
| t&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; || 1998.82 || 2003.98 || 2008.26 || 2011.92 || 2015.12
|-
| t-stat || 37.8 || 30.5 || 25.8 || 23.6 || 22.3
|-
| R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; || 0.973 || 0.960 || 0.945 || 0.935 || 0.927
|}

The results show that values ranging anywhere between 2,500 and 4,500 kilometers (and possibly higher) are possible for maximum K values, based on the strength of the R-squared and t-stat numbers. These numbers are highest for K = 2,500 km. However, plans by the French government plans for up to 4,600 km of total track in the years ahead [BBC news article]. Based on the strength of the results from the regression analysis, the future saturation limit of HSR in France is difficult to predict based in the chronology of past construction.

===The future of HSR in France and Europe===

Analyzing the future effects of privatization and investment in future HSR service in France is difficult, particularly during the current global financial crisis, and the high volatility in oil prices around the globe. Ultimately, the success of TGV over time may provide France a competitive edge as the HSR network expands throughout Europe, and HSR services becomes privatized, meaning TGV services can enter markets outside of France. 

As markets open up to competition, the playing field around HSR is bound to get more interesting. The consortium of state-owned operators like Eurostar and Thalys may soon have to operate alongside other service providers, including new entrants to the market. With the decline of short-haul air travel, airlines like Air France have considered entering the HSR market, with one ticket offering connecting service between air and rail. In this scenario, rail and air travel may become as much complementary modes as they do competitive modes. [Spiegel]

In the interest of improving the operations and management of HSR across borders, the 7 HSR providers in Europe have formed a marketing alliance called Railteam. These companies include SNCF (France), Eurostar UK, DB (Germany), OBB (Austria), SBB (Switzerland), NS Hispeed (Netherlands), and SNCB (Belgium). This alliance is similar to partnerships between airlines in terms of marketing and sales, such as KLM and Delta. High-speed rail operatiors sought to create a booking system that would allow travellers to purchase tickets across multiple providers, and receive a comparable level of service, regardless of which train they traveled on. These efforts were abandoned in late 2009, when it was determined that the policies of each individual service provider were too difficult and expensive to bring together.One of the main goals in this alliance was not necessarily to develop or expand upon the physical technology of HSR, but to develop a single Europe-wide booking system to improve efficiency. This service would make it possible to book travel anywhere across Europe with a single ticket, in place of seperate transactions required for international travel (with exceptions for travel on Thalys or Eurostar lines). Due to increasing costs and complexities of creating this system, the project was scrapped in 2009. [BBC 2009]

Attempting to bridge differences in pricing and service policy between individual countries has made providing joint service difficult. In the near future, Deutsche-Bahn trains will soon travel on the TGV Est line linking Frankfurt and Paris. However, customers and workers in each country are accustomed to how their respective systems operate. Whereas France uses a demand-based pricing system with required reservations, Germany uses a fixed-price system, and reservations are not required. These differences have proven difficult for the two parties to resolve. Additionally, labor rules differ between the two countries further complicate matters between the separate operators. While a complete agreement has yet to take shape, SNCF and DB are working to bridge these gaps incrementally over time. [mr]

As the HSR rail system grows throughout Europe, technological advances will continue to improve the quality of service provided on the rail infrastructure itself. With the HSR market being opened up to competition through privatization, innovation will further grow the network over time.

iTunes Utalk:Welcome.


=='''What is iTunes University? ''' ==

iTunes U is an app for the iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch. The app allows access to free courses that are taught by instructors in schools and universities. Students are able to view their assignments, and check them off on the screen as they complete each assignment. Course materials are accessed through the mobile device and can be downloaded. iTunes U is similar to iBooks in layout and organization.  Users can search the catalog for the courses they want, and subcribe to the classes.  Courses that users subscribe to appear in their library.  Users are able to input notes directly to their class.  Educators can use iTunes U to upload their own courses to the app, and can include any notes, lectures, and assignments they wish to give to their students.  Links can be provided to other apps that will help with the class, such as graphing calculators.  iTunes U was designed to allow anyone with a mobile device easy access to continuing education.  



=='''History'''==
On May 30, 2007 at Cupertino, California iTunes U was officially announced. The purpose of iTunes U was to create, distribute, manage and control access to educational material consisting of video, PDF files and audio files for students. Institutions who wish to contribute to iTunes U are given their own iTunes U site that uses the Apple's iTunes Store infrastructure. This service is free to the user. Users may edit their sites by using an editing tool, the Woolamaloo Automator. This tool was created by Apple to permit users not familiar with XML tools to be able to make changes to their site.

== '''About''' ==
The most important thing about iTunes is that many of the resources are provided for no cost, allowing virtually anyone the opportunity for continued learning on many topics of interest. More than 800 universities have active iTunes U sites. About half of these institutions — including [http://www.standford.edu%20Stanford%20University Stanford], [http://www.yale.edu Yale], [http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm MIT Open Courseware], [http://www.oxford.edu%20Oxford Oxford]and [http://berkeley.edu/ UC Berkeley] — distribute their content publicly on the iTunes Store. The [http://www.open.ac.uk/ Open University] in the UK set the record for the most downloads as of October 3rd, 2011 having reached 40 million downloads.&lt;ref&gt;Coughlan, S. (2011, October 3). Education and Family. In Open University’s record iTunes U downloads (BBC news). Retrieved from http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-15150319&lt;/ref&gt;

iTunes allows anyone to view lectures and video from the universities and institutions that participate. While there is some content that is blocked, the majority of the resources are for anyone. K-12 schools have found many ways to integrate the resource by providing professional resources on things like Special Education resources.
[[File:An_iTunes_Gift_Card2.jpg]]

== '''Participants''' ==
Participants include individuals and universities worldwide who may customize their iTunes site to fit their particular needs. Participants of iTunes U are able to limit the access to their sites to a specific set of viewers or individuals.&lt;ref&gt;What is iTunes U? (2011). Let the learning begin (apple). Retrieved October 14, 2011, from http://www.apple.com/education/itunes-u/what-is.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=='''Site Navigation'''==
Access to iTunes U may be gained through Apple’s iTunes store, just click the iTunes tab located at the top of the store page. To access specific colleges or universities the Universities &amp; College section must be visited.  The “Beyond Campus” sections allows to user to visit other institutions.

=='''Course materials and more'''==
Lectures are not the only benefit, iTunes U supports the PDF and ePub file format and can be used to distribute materials to students wirelessly to their e-readers, phones or computers.
Other resources may be found in iTunes U.  These include access to museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and libraries such as The Library of Congress.  These resources and others may be found on the Beyond Campus page in iTunes U.

Additional iTunes University topics include art and architecture, business, communications &amp; media, engineering, health &amp; medicine, history, language, law &amp; politics, literature, mathematics, philosophy, psychology &amp; social sciences, religion &amp; spirituality, science, society, and teaching &amp; learning. There are lectures and courses for every age group from early elementary to college. When searching in a k-12 environment the main page has courses from various high schools from across the United States and even other countries such as Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Students studying a foreign language can find a course from a different country to actually apply the language they are learning to a real life environment. 

The Weekly Education Spotlight [http://www.apple.com/itunesnews/education/us/?cid=ITS-NAUS-ITUNESU-ITUNESNEWS090506 Education Spotlight] can be used by educators and students to find new courses or very popular courses that may be of interest to them. The spotlight can include a variety of features such as the Open University ''Volcanoes'', ''Lyndon B. Johnson: The Space Age'', Foxcroft Academy- ''English 111 Identity and Society'', and ''CSIS Careers in Global Development''. The Education Spotlight also highlights iBooks Textbooks such as ''The Writer's Voice'' by Lynne Dozier and Apps for Learning such as Virtual Human Body.

== '''How to Find the Good Stuff''' == 
the iTunes advanced search allows you to customize your search. If you are looking for lectures on Ancient Rome, you can &lt;br /&gt;

1)click on this [[itms://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/advancedSearch|link]]:&lt;br /&gt;

2)select iTunes U in the first box &lt;br /&gt;
 
3)type in your search term.&lt;br /&gt;


iTunes updates their main page regularly so if there is new content you will find it here. Then, if you find lectures by someone you like, search for other lectures by the same person.

=='''Benefits'''==
Universities worldwide have a home for their digital content that may be accessed by students anywhere.  The materials on iTunes U are easily downloaded and viewed on a number of devices including PC, iPhones, Mac and iPods.
Teachers are able to bring the world to their students.  They may enhance their lessons by taking students on virtual field trips, attending concerts or lectures whenever it fits their lesson plans.  Students may access iTunes U as a reference source or study a concept more in depth.

Through iTunes U a lifelong learning process in encouraged. Schools may use the wealth of knowledge in iTunes U as a budget preserving measure.  University lessons may supplement a teacher’s classroom lessons.

==='''Accessible to all students'''===
iTunes provides resources for those with disabilities. For those who are vision impaired, they can use VoiceOver on the Mac and screen readers on PCs. Physically disabled can have the university brought to them allowing them to learn in an environment that is comfortable and with the necessities they require.

==='''K-12 Integration'''===
iTunes is online source of information that can be accessed by both students and teachers.  iTunes U has made many resources available for teachers at any grade level.  For example an extensive library of videos, audio lectures and lesson plans can be used for the classroom.  After an iTunes account is established the user can create a playlist based on grade level or subject.  Resources can be then downloaded into that playlist (Using iTunes in the Classroom, 2012).  A search tool is available within the application to find appropriate content.  Following a search, the user can then browse the results.  The results can be viewed using the preview feature.  Following the preview, the user can download the content to the library or move on to the next topic.  The library is an easy way to organize and access downloaded materials.  Within the library specific tabs can be setup based on the type of material.  In addition, the library owner can setup permissions to allow others to share all or some of the materials (iTunes U at Roosevelt University, 2011).   


K-12 schools are beginning to integrate the services of iTunes into their curricula and many state departments of education are also using the service. For example, the [http://www.doe.k12.ga.us/ Georgia Department of Education] site has categories for best practice writing, best practice social studies, teaching social studies and special education – significant cognitive disabilities. These resources can be helpful to teachers everywhere.

==Introduction==
===The Early Years===

The eastern United States was well developed and had been operating railroads for nearly 30 years before major settlements took shape in California during the 1850's.  After the discover of gold in 1848, numerous people fled to seek wealth in California during the gold rush.  Approximately 200,000 came between 1849 and 1851 with over 100,000 more coming in the next five years.&lt;ref name=&quot;r2&quot;&gt;Lewis, Robert. &quot;Photographing the California Gold Rush.&quot; History Today 52.3 (2002): 11-17. Web. [http://content.ebscohost.com.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/pdf13_15/pdf/2002/HIT/01Mar02/6299278.pdf?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=6299278&amp;S=R&amp;D=aph&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNHX8kSep7M4zdnyOLCmr0mep7BSs664SK6WxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGrsEyuqbRJuePfgeyx44Dt6fIA].&lt;/ref&gt;  As a direct result of the sudden population growth, California became the 31st state in 1850.

The first railroad in California was the Sacramento Valley Railroad which operated from 1852-1877.&lt;ref name=&quot;r3&quot;&gt;Fickewirth, Alvin A. California Railroads: an Encyclopedia of Cable Car, Common Carrier, Horsecar, Industrial, Interurban, Logging, Monorail, Motor Road, Shortlines, Streetcar, Switching and Terminal Railroads in California. San Marino: Golden West, 1992. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 23 mile main line connected the San Fransisco Bay Area and Sacramento.  The track was seven inches wider than standard gauge which limited the compatibility with other railroads that would later be developed.  Since railroad technology had already been developed in the eastern United States, California's railroads could deploy much faster than the early east coast railroads.  As a result, California's railroads had a much shorter birthing phase as they could use the knowledge gained from the earlier railroads.  

Theodore Judah was the chief engineer for the Sacramento Valley RR and later the Central Pacific RR.&lt;ref name=&quot;r3&quot;&gt;Fickewirth, Alvin A. California Railroads: an Encyclopedia of Cable Car, Common Carrier, Horsecar, Industrial, Interurban, Logging, Monorail, Motor Road, Shortlines, Streetcar, Switching and Terminal Railroads in California. San Marino: Golden West, 1992. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Judah was the main proponent in Sacramento for the development of a transcontinental railroad, but the idea did not gain support for several years.  The idea of an east to west link had gained interest after the settlement of Oregon in 1846, acquiring territories from Mexico in 1848, and the discovery of gold in California.&lt;ref name=&quot;r4&quot;&gt;&quot;Transcontinental Railroad.&quot; Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia. 6th ed. 1 Oct. 2011. Web. [http://web.ebscohost.com.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/ehost/detail?vid=4&amp;hid=17&amp;sid=56a8a377-932b-4d91-88ae-0215fc8cfaf4%40sessionmgr14&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=39036752].&lt;/ref&gt;  Settlers traveled to the west coast by traversing the dangerous trails by horseback and wagon trains.  Adding a railroad would rapidly speed up travel time and make travel safer as well as reducing the cost of shipping goods long distances.  

Asa Whitney, a supporter of the idea form New York, had proposed it to congress in 1845.&lt;ref name=&quot;r5&quot;&gt;&quot;Asa Whitney.&quot; Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia. 6th ed. 1 Oct. 2011.

By 1893, five lines had been completed connecting the west coast to the rest of the United States.  The Northern Pacific and Great Northern Railroads had built lines connecting Oregon and Washington to Minnesota and the Great Lakes.  The Santa Fe Railroad connected Los Angeles to Atchinson, Kansas, and the Southern Pacific Railroad connected Los Angeles to New Orleans, Louisiana.

===Steady Growth===
Once the first transcontinental railway was completed, California's Railroads shifted most of it's construction emphasis to linking the state north to south instead of east to west.  This had substantial benefit, but not as much as linking to the eastern United States, so expansion of the railroad network followed a linear model for the next several decades.  During this time some railroads were already being consolidated.  In 1877, the Sacramento Valley Railroad and the Folsom and Placerville Railroad merged to form the Sacramento and Placerville Railroad.&lt;ref name=&quot;r3&quot;&gt;Fickewirth, Alvin A. California Railroads: an Encyclopedia of Cable Car, Common Carrier, Horsecar, Industrial, Interurban, Logging, Monorail, Motor Road, Shortlines, Streetcar, Switching and Terminal Railroads in California. San Marino: Golden West, 1992. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1870 to 1900, larger railroads like the Southern Pacific and the Northern Railway began to take control over numerous smaller railroads.

===Maturity and Steady Decline===
With some railroad tracks at capacity and others underutilized, it was time for restructuring and more consolidation.  Over a hundred different railroads had operated in California by 1890 and almost a hundred more started operation between 1890 and 1910.  There were too many railroads to efficiently operate all at once.  The major railroads of Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe, Southern Pacific, Central Pacific and Union Pacific were consolidating with other smaller railroads.  California was experiencing many of the problems that all railroads in the U.S. faced.  At the start of World War I, railroads were the largest industry in the country and access to eastern ports was congested.&lt;ref name=&quot;r7&quot;&gt;Garrison, William L., and David M. Levinson. The Transportation Experience. New York: Oxford UP, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to avoid shortages and provide more efficiency, the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) was granted more powers.  Later in 1917, the government to control of the largest railroads and put them under the control of the United States Railway Administration (USRA).  Nationalization did not help reduce shipping costs so the Transportation Act of 1920 was passed and returned railroads back to private ownership.  By this time, the miles of railroad track in California had already peaked in 1915.  Track miles were maintained for almost a decade before starting a slow annual decline as a result of the Great Depression and World War II, as well as the rise in airplanes as an alternative mode to the railroads.

==Methodology==
The analysis of the life cycle of most modes of transportation follows a traditional logistic curve also known as an S-curve.  In the early years, advancements in the technology result in rapid growth that can be modeled as a period of exponential growth.  A single innovation can spark several improvements and multiple benefits.  As the system expands, the rate of return weakens to a linear relationship.  Adding new rail lines results in some benefit, but not as much as implementing the first lines did.  Eventually the network grow big enough such that the most profitable lines were are built and new line result in little benefit to the entire system.  As the system matures, the extent of the network levels off and begins to decline as a result of consolidation and optimization of the system.  Typically, a new technology comes along to make the old technology obsolete and it declines to extinction or to an optimal lower level of service.

The Logistic Formula:

&lt;math&gt;S(t) = K/\left(1+e^ {-b  ( t - t_0 )}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
*S(t) is a measure of the transportation system at a given time [miles of railroad in California]
*t is time [years]
*t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the time when S(t) is at the inflection point of the S-curve [years]
*K is the maximum capacity of the transportation system [miles]
*b is a coefficient that affects how quickly a system reaches maturity


The S(t) formula can be transformed to get a the following linear relationship:


&lt;math&gt;\ln\left(\cfrac{S(t)}{(K - S(t))}\right) = c + b \times t&lt;/math&gt;


Where:
*b from the S-curve
*c = -b * t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;

There are three unknown parameters (K, n, c) and only two can be fitted, so different K values are chosen and linear regression is done to get the other two using the Least Squares method.  Microsoft Excel is used to perform the analysis and obtain the slope and intercept of the best fit line.  Since the miles of railroad peaked in 1915 at 8451, the real K value is set at 8460.  However, this does not fit the data very well, so Excel's solver is used to obtain the best K, m,&amp; a while minimizing the sum of the square errors.  The optimal parameters for the S-curves can be seen in Table 2.  The S-curves only model the growth phase and only use the data until 1915 to do the linear regression to fit K, n,&amp; c.

The plot of the data in Figure 1 indicates that the birthing and the maturity phases were very short compared to the time span of the entire system.  This indicates that the data may actually follow a two stage linear model, one for the growth phase and one for the decline phase.  The peak number of miles occurs in 1915, so the year 1915 serves as the breaking point for the analysis of the growth and decline phases.  Again Excel is used to do the linear regression and the optimal parameters can be seen in Table 3.     

Data about California's railroads was obtained from numerous annual ''Statistical Abstracts'' from the U.S. Census Bureau.&lt;ref name=&quot;r1&quot;&gt;United States. U.S. Census Bureau. U.S. Department of Commerce. Statistical Abstracts. 1881 1887 1891 1896 1900 1904 1908 1911 1913 1914 1916 1917 1920 1950 1970. Web. [http://www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/statab.html].&lt;/ref&gt;  Each report gave data for every five or ten years and the individual year data for two or three years before the publication of the report.  In order to make a complete data set, data from several reports was merged together and can be seen in Table 1 below.  For some of the annual reports, the numbers contradicted each other; thus, for the purposes of this analysis, the most recent value was consider to be more accurate.

==Analysis==
In Figure 1, the life cycle phases can be seen.  There is no distinct point at which the birthing ends and steady growth begins, but the transition year is found to be 1875.  Similarly, the growth period ends rather abruptly with a little or no transition period.  The year decided to be the beginning of maturity is 1911.  A slow steady decline is deemed to begin in 1920 and continue through WWII.  The timing of maturity occurs at approximately the same time the entire United States railroads mature and is contributed by the start of WWI and failed nationalization of larger railroads at the time.  The continual decline in the 30's and 40's is mainly contributed to the Great Depression and WWII.

In Figure 2, the two best fitting S-curves are illustrated with the data.  Since the transition between phases is rather abrupt, the curves do not fit particularly well.  Even though the S-curves were fitted using only the growth data, the location of t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and the tight transitions cause the S-curves to predict capacity is not reached until approximately 1930, 15 years later than reality.  Figures 4 and 5 illustrate that the transformed data has an weak linear relationship as the r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; values are 0.84 for K=8460 and 0.91 for K=9152.104.

Since the S-curves were not very accurate at predicting the annual track miles, a two stage linear model was analyzed and can be seen in Figure 3.  The fit for the growth phase had an r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; value of 0.99 and the decline phase had an r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; value of 0.91.  Only the first year of the birthing phase does not get modeled accurately with a linear relationship and the r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; values are significantly better than the S-curves.

==Conclusion==
The deployment of California's railroads was greatly influenced by the historical events of its time.  The gold rush created the demand for more efficient transportation modes.  The divisions between the north and south delayed the start of construction on the first transcontinental railroad.  World War I, shipping congestion, and experimental nationalization of the larger railroads started the maturity phase.  The rise of the airplane as an alternative to railroads, the Great Depression, and World War II caused the miles of railroad track to slowly decline in the 30's and 40's.

Since railroad technology was already being improved in the rest of the country, California's railroads experienced a short birthing phase.  Railroads were able to deploy technology that was already proven to be successful elsewhere.  The relatively unexpected level of track miles in 1915 due to other issue going on in the U.S. could have prematurely ended the growth phase.  A short birthing phase and transition periods can explain why a linear model fits the data better.  If California's railroads had developed independently from the rest of the country, perhaps an S-curve would fit the data better then and linear model.  Like any technology, the success or failure of California's railroad was directly dependent on the alternative modes and the external factor the entire country was facing during the time period.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi

This is Susan Parker. I am pharmacist by profession and I always like to get more information about various health medications through research on the web. I have carried my research for various diseases such as Cancer, Ulcer, Diabetes and few related to men's health such as [http://www.buzzpharmacy.net/ Erectile Dysfunction]. I think these days herbal medicines are getting more demand over the other antibiotics options.

I would love to get more information on relative topics on this portal.

==Competition==
There are several ways to travel between countries across oceans, but commercial airliners currently have a monopoly on travel speed.  Before the introduction of motorized ships, a reasonable transatlantic travel time for sailing ships was one to two months.  Motorized ships running on coal brought a spectacular improvement in speed and reliability further reducing one-way transatlantic travel to 16 days in 1840.&lt;ref name=Decker&gt;Decker, Kris D. Life without Airplanes: from London to New York in 3 days and 12 hours. Low-tech Magazine. 4 June 2008. Retrieved 12 October 2011. [http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2008/06/ocean-liners.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  With the advent of diesel engines and alternative, weight reducing building materials, travel times were decreased even further.  In 1952, the SS United States built primarily out of aluminum set the record for the fastest transatlantic crossing of 3 days and 12 hours at a speed of more than 54 km/h which still stands today.&lt;ref&gt; Liner Transatlantic Crossing Times, 1838 - 1952 (in days). The Geography of Transport Systems. Retrieved 10 October 2011. [http://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch3en/conc3en/linertransatlantic.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of transportation that appeared before and remained competitive with the commercial airliner until the 1940s and 50s were airships, specifically Zeppelins. Perhaps the most successful passenger airship of all time was the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin.  It logged over a million miles during its life -- including the first round-the-world flight in 1929.  On October 11, 1928 it departed Friedrichshafen, Germany inaugurating aerial transatlantic passenger service.  After a flight of 111 hours and 44 minutes, the ship landed at Lakehurst, New Jersey on October 15, 1928.  It carried a crew of 40 members and 20 passengers&lt;ref name=Graf&gt;Graf Zeppelin History. Airships: The Hindenburg and other Zeppelins. 2009. Retrieved 12 October 2011. [http://www.airships.net/lz127-graf-zeppelin/history]&lt;/ref&gt;  The return trip to Germany took 71 hours and 49 minutes, or just under three days.  Ocean liners of the day took twice as long to carry passengers across the Atlantic.&lt;ref name=Graf&gt;Graf Zeppelin History. Airships: The Hindenburg and other Zeppelins. 2009. Retrieved 12 October 2011. [http://www.airships.net/lz127-graf-zeppelin/history]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite faster travel times, zeppelins were severely disadvantaged in other ways.  Passenger loads were normally if not always under 100 people and because of their enormous size they were very resource intensive requiring huge manufacturing hangers and specialty docking areas.  The grand zeppelin era when out in a blaze as the infamous Hindenburg, buoyant with explosive hydrogen, became a gigantic floating then falling fireball.

==Birth of International Flight==

===Advantages===

====Speed====
As the ear of the zeppelin self-destructed, the public demand for quick travel edged other modes of transit as well.  By the 1940s and 1950s, commercial transatlantic flights had ushered in a new reference system measured in hours rather than days.  A single commercial airplane could travel from NYC to London across the Atlantic Ocean in 5 or 6 hours.  Quickness and directness have been and continue to be the greatest assets of aviation.  Most vacationers and travelers today are limited in travel time due to work obligations consequently increasing the importance of quick, hassle-free travel.  Previously, with ships and zeppelins, travelers would have determine if the duration and quality of potential vacation experiences would outweigh the duration of travel time. Now, vacationers can book a plane ticket, hop a plane and have a meal in a country thousands of kilometers away in the same day.

====Capacity====
Passenger capacities also make airline travel very competitive.  Early passenger loads were similar to those carried by Zeppelins, but with technological advances in building materials, weight saving techniques and increased engine thrust, hundreds of passengers can now be moved at once.

====Safety====
Safety is another advantage of airline travel.  Based solely on deaths or even crashes per kilometer traveled, airplanes are one of the safest means of transit ever. Pilot expertise and safety regulations on planes have reduced the amount of flight accidents. Air travel generally avoids most weather patterns by flying above the clouds, which makes the trip safe and unaffected by storm activity. On the other hand, sea travel is directly affected by any weather changes, which create wind or cause large waves, sometimes extending the voyage making it tedious and more dangerous. Sea travel also requires skilled navigation to avoid dangerous rock formations or ice flows, while air travel has fewer such dangers.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, Richard B. Making Sense of the Airline Safety Debate. Cato Review of Business &amp; Government. 1991. Retrieved 12 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  These dangers can be further reduced by using auto pilot technology.

====Pricing====
Lastly, demand for air travel has increased the number of international flights and carriers, making commercial airliners even more desirable.  Initially, flying was a very expensive mode of transportation, which only the wealthy could afford but as markets went global companies began paying for businessmen to fly. Now, competition between carriers has driven down flight costs and increased travel options with regards to varied flight times, directness, amenities and comfort.

===Innovation===
* Jet engine:  Although patents for working gas-powered jet engines have been awarded since the late 1700s the first to actually power an airplane was developed by a German named Hans von Ohain. A successful first flight on August 27, 1939, established the Heinkel He 178 as the world's first jet plane.&lt;ref&gt;Warsitz, Lutz: THE FIRST JET PILOT - The Story of German Test Pilot Erich Warsitz (p. 125), Pen and Sword Books Ltd., England, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1950s the jet engine was almost universal in combat aircraft and was becoming common on British commercial passenger planes.  By the 1960s, all large civilian planes were jet powered despite piston and prop engines being more efficient fuel burners.  With the advent of high bypass turbofan jet engines which better performed at high speeds and high altitudes, jet engines became as efficient as precursor engines.&lt;ref&gt; Chapter 10: Technology of the Airplane. Quest for Performance: The Evolution of Modern Aircraft. Part II: The Jet Age. Hq.nasa.gov. Retrieved 12 October 2011. [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-468/ch10-3.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, gas turbine engines phased out props in commercial applications because they have a great power-to-weight ratio.  Gas turbine engines are also smaller than their reciprocating counterparts of the same power.  Consequently, commercial airliners were encouraged to grow.
* Kerosene fuel: Increases in flight altitudes and lengths meant components and fuel would be subject to a greater number of conditions. Jet fuel known as Jet-A was developed especially for commercial jet planes provided much needed consistency and  reliability.  Jet-A is pure kerosene which has a high flashpoint (temperature at which fumes can be ignited by an open flame) and is high in octane (ensures efficient fuel burning).  It is often mixed with antifreeze to prevent ice build up in the fuel tanks, potentially blocking fuel lines and stalling engines.
* Auto pilot: Navigational accuracy is an essential part of an auto pilot system.  By reducing minute navigational errors commonly made by human pilots, auto pilots can reduce flight times and maximize fuel efficiency.  As a result, auto pilot systems ensure reliable maximum linear distances.
* Composite Materials:  Since the use of aluminum for airplanes in the 1920s, several composite materials combining two or more organic or inorganic components such as fiberglass, carbon fiber, and other exotic fibers have been developed and used.  The greatest value of composite materials is that they can be both lightweight and strong. The heavier an aircraft weighs, the more fuel it burns, so reducing weight is important to aeronautical engineers.&lt;ref name=Composites&gt; Composites and Advanced Materials. US Centennial of Flight Commission. [http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Evolution_of_Technology/composites/Tech40.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, aluminum can be repaired after sustained denting.  Composites cannot.  Although about 10% of the structural weight of the Boeing 777 is composite material, commercial airliners will likely continue to be built using aluminum because it requires less maintenance.&lt;ref name=Composites&gt; Composites and Advanced Materials. US Centennial of Flight Commission. [http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Evolution_of_Technology/composites/Tech40.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policies===
* Fuel types were regulated to ensure safety.  Jet engines are much more sensitive to the chemical and physical properties of fuel than gasoline and diesel engines.&lt;ref name=a&gt; The History of Jet Fuel. Air BP. [http://www.bp.com/sectiongenericarticle.do?categoryId=4503664&amp;contentId=57733]&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;Advances in engine and aircraft design greatly expanded varieties of flight envelope which necessitated new standards for turbine engine fuel quality. This led to the introduction of a variety of fuel types for different purposes and to the development of specifications to ensure the fuel met equipment requirements and burned reliably under all flight conditions.&quot;&lt;ref name=a&gt; The History of Jet Fuel. Air BP. [http://www.bp.com/sectiongenericarticle.do?categoryId=4503664&amp;contentId=57733]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Runway length:  Each plane model has minimum takeoff and landing distance requirements.  Runway lengths had to be standardized not only to to make international flight possible but to encourage it.

==Growth Period==

===Policies===
* Runway Protection Zones: &quot;Trapezoidal areas off the end of the runway end that serve to enhance the protection of people and property on the ground in the event an aircraft lands or crashes beyond the runway end.&quot;&lt;ref name=b&gt; Runway Protection Zones. Central Region Airports Division. AIP Sponsor Guide – 500. 1 October 2010. Retrieved 14 October 2011. [http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:VyseXFfYaTkJ:www.faa.gov/airports/central/aip/sponsor_guide/media/0500.pdf+runway+protection+zone&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShkvAGCt6zUSQtJKS40S10hJri1JENL4Wz4NMDpu2CqvdJ2Vlzcm7gSCP8le2C9TzUq9iYeAJN0Sf-skp3VOJRehz2LxgX8ei6tiaDU5_t8mFQ7Am_Dzzbrm2iycJJ6-kLvE3Bl&amp;sig=AHIEtbQoSKR0nfv8qYp3AX5s-T_wNkW_iA]&lt;/ref&gt;  Airports must adhere to three stipulations under FAA design criteria with regards to RPZs.  First, the airport must own the land.  Second, the airport owner must protect the RPZ from both obstructions and incompatible land uses. Finally, the airport owner must strive to attain compatible zoning around the airport in order to prevent incompatible land uses that could cause or lead to conflicts that endanger the airport, cause the airport to close, to require substantial remedial investment to purchase conflicting developing property.&lt;ref name=b&gt; Runway Protection Zones.

* Landing Fees: A regulation that requires a an airplane pay a fee to the airport at which it lands. If lots of planes want to land at a busy airport, the landing fees will be high due to great demand for a fixed amount of terminals. These high costs disproportionately favor large commercial airplanes because they can carry large numbers of people to offset the costs of the fees.  Therefore, high landing costs encourage larger planes.
* Runway Length: As commercial planes become bigger and bigger they require more and more runway to takeoff and land on.  As a result, airports often have to extend their runways in order to capture the business of these larger airplanes. By actively protecting RPZs early on airports can accommodate runway extensions and reap the benefits the larger airplanes bring.
* Security Procedures: Many of the security policies such as full body scans, liquid restrictions, shoe and belt removal put in place after 9/11/01 have made international travel more bothersome than it used to be. The outcomes of one day ten years ago has and will continue to negatively impact the growth of international air travel.

==Methodology==

The process of calculating passenger kilometers involved several steps. First, an &quot;international flight&quot; was defined as a flight consisting of at least 5568 km (the distance from NYC to London).  This established the minimum flight range and eliminated commercial passenger planes flying prior to 1938.  It also insured consistency throughout the data and subsequent analysis.  Secondly, a list of planes and their first service years was put together with the help of Wikipedia.  Thirdly, aircraft technical data and specifications regarding the maximum passenger configurations of each plane, their maximum flight ranges, and entry date into service were obtained.&lt;ref&gt;Aircraft Technical Data &amp; Specifications. 2011. Retrieved 10 October 2011. [http://www.airliners.net/aircraft-data/]&lt;/ref&gt;  Fourthly, passenger kilometers were calculated as the product of the number of passengers a plane can carry multiplied by that planes flight range.

As the values of K increased, the Adjusted R Square plateaued at about 71 percent indicating 71 percent of the movements (generated numbers) are explained in the adjustments of the variable.  Additionally, the F score stabilized at 54 and the T score at 7.4 indicating that the model on the whole is statistically significant.

The Adjusted R Square value of .71 was associated with a K value of 27000000 km.  After 27000000 km, all three measurements (adjusted R, F score, and T score) changed less than .1 between each subsequent K value.  This minimal change indicates that all values of K after 270000000km are equally good models for determining K, even 50000000 km.  Therefore, K = 27000000 was used as the best fit line of regression.

S(t) = K/[1+exp(-b(t-t0)]

As previously explained, the K value of 27000000 was chosen because it marked the beginning of the plateau.  Table 5 synthesizes the information gathered from the regression calculation for the K value of 27000000.  Using the calculated intercept and b coefficient, t0 (the inflection point in years where passenger km begins increasing at a decreasing rate) can be figured.  t0 for K = 27000000 is the year 2031.  Using these variables, an S-curve was calculated using the equation S(t) = K/[1+exp(-b(t-t0)].  The resulting S-curve on the right depicts advances in passenger kilometers will begin to decrease after year 2031, and begin leveling off at 27000000 passenger kilometers in roughly the year 2170 in the graph.  Because all parameters are maximum numbers, the determined inflection point is a relative extreme value if fuel types remain consistent.  Changes in fuel type and fuel efficiency were not factored into this analysis.

==Maturity==
===Policies===
* Runway and terminal lengths will likely limit the final size of large planes.  Although larger planes will continue to be more profitable than small planes in the presence of landing fees, terminal size will become an issue.  A trade off will have to be made between the number of planes allowed to dock at an airport or the size of the airplanes allowed to dock. 
* Some airports have more room to expand than do others.  This may lead to a size specialization in commercial flight in which super mega planes are able to take off and land at select airports.  However, this specialization is likely disadvantageous since in order to truly reap the benefits of a super mega sized plane it should be operated around the clock all year long.  Not doing so, would be a waste of capital investment.  Then again if super mega planes can only travel between select airports the number of trip options and possibilities go down further decreasing their economic viability.

 
Despite the model, the range of commercial airplanes has likely reached its peak because there is no need for a plane that can fly more than half way around the world.  Therefore, to increase passenger kilometers per flight, planes will have to get bigger and carry more passengers. The Airbus A380 is currently the largest airplane in the world and like the Boeing 747 before it, will likely hold that title for several decades. Reason being, the costs of building larger planes and the costs of adapting infrastructure (terminals and runways) to accommodate larger planes will likely curb the growth in passenger kilometers per flight.  Therefore, although the model predicts growth until year 2170, the growth will likely be sporadic and may result in a maturity plateau before 2170.

==Conclusion==
Demand for quick, safe and cheap international travel has driven airline companies to invest in larger airplanes, light weight composite materials and larger, more efficient engines.  When combined, those factors have increased fuel burning efficiencies, and contributed to an increase in potential passenger kilometers per flight.  Based on the maximum passenger capacity and flight range of 22 planes, passenger kilometers traveled per flight will exponentially increase until year 2031 then exponentially decrease until the technology plateaus around year 2170 according to the produced model.  Although the model predicts this, it may be skewed by the enormous passenger capacity of the recently inaugurated Airbus A380.  Introductions of mega planes such as the A380 are few and far between resulting in a rather sporadic data set which affects the inflection point and year of maturity.  Additionally, other constraints such as the size of the world and length of runways have already begun to limit necessary maximum flight ranges and plane size (directly affects passenger capacity).  Therefore, maturation of passenger kilometers per flight will likely happen earlier than the model predicts.

{{Template shortcut|404|dl|dead|Broken link}}

==Usage==
Use {{Tl|dead link}} when you find a [[w:WP:Linkrot|dead link]] to a website within a paragraph or a [[WB:REFS|reference citation]]. Doing so will place a note by the URL and add the page to the [[:Category:Pages with dead external links]] category.

Append this template '''directly after''' the link or template, leaving the original link intact.  Not doing so will prevent detection from automated tools.  If the citation contains multiple URLs (e.g. chapterurl and url) in a template, and only one is broken, you can use &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;!-- hidden text --&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to explain which one is broken.

If the article uses [[WB:REFS|clickable footnotes]], then this tag should be placed just before the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; that contains the dead link. The notice will then correctly appear in the reference section (instead of in the body of the text, which is not recommended).

Avoid using this template to identify dead external links that are ''not'' used as references for book content.  Instead, dead external links should normally be removed.

;Common form (with current date)
&lt;tt&gt;{&amp;#123;Dead link|date={{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}}}&lt;/tt&gt;

===Optional parameters===
;url: Provides a history of the linked page via [[w:Wayback Machine|Wayback Machine]].  Set '''only''' if history actually exists, as otherwise it is misleading to users and editors.
;date: Month name followed by year, for use by the categorization system.  Use &lt;code&gt;date={{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;If you don't add a date parameter, a bot will date your entry with the month and year at a later time.
;bot: [[Wikibooks:Bots|Bot accounts]] specify the |bot= parameter as a sign that the tag was added by an automated process.  Set as &lt;code&gt;bot=&lt;bot name&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

==Examples==
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://example.org
|title=title
|accessdate=2000-01-01
}} {{Dead link
|date=April 2005
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;→ &lt;span style=&quot;background:white&quot;&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://example.org
|title=title
|accessdate=2000-01-01
}} {{Dead link
|date=April 2005
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Retrieved 5 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;→ &lt;span style=&quot;background:white&quot;&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plunkett, John. [http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,14173,1601858,00.html &quot;Sorrell accuses Murdoch of panic buying&quot;],{{Dead link}} ''The Guardian'', London, 27 October 2005. Retrieved 5 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;references /&gt;

===Caveats===
* Avoid using free links (e.g. &lt;code&gt;http://example.org/{{Dead link&lt;nowiki /&gt;}}&lt;/code&gt;) as software unable to handle templates may read an incorrect link. Add brackets if necessary.
* Avoid complicated formatting. Nesting inside a template is generally not supported well.  
* Avoid using &lt;tt&gt;[ ] { | } &lt; &gt;&lt;/tt&gt; character between the end of the external link and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Dead link}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, as they are often used to format text

&lt;!--EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE--&gt;

This meta-template can be used to create in-line clean up messages which can be used to tag issues on a line-by-line basis. Many templates are based upon it, like {{Tl|citation needed}}.

It should '''not''' be used directly on articles by itself - instead, use one of the pre-existing derivatives if at all possible. Should there be no suitable derivative already, new ones can be created using the syntax below, but please discuss the need for any new template first. Otherwise, the sub-template in question is likely to end up at [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion]], as it is better for Wikibooks to have a finite and well-tested set of in-line tags than to allow for endless variation.

=== Usage ===
&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow: auto&quot;&gt;
{{ Fix
| substcheck= &lt;includeonly&gt;{{subst:&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;substcheck}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;
| link      = &lt;Page which text should link to, without brackets&gt; (default = Wikipedia:Cleanup)
| text      = &lt;Text to be displayed for the link&gt;
| pre-text  = &lt;Optional text to print before the linked text&gt;
| post-text = &lt;Optional text to print after the linked text&gt;
| class     = &lt;Class to set text to&gt; (default = &quot;noprint Inline-Template&quot;; neither should be removed, but additional classes can be added, e.g. &quot;noprint Inline-Template FooBarBazQuux&quot;)
| title     = &lt;Tool--tip text to display when mouse is hovered over link&gt;
| special   = &lt;Optional replacement for text, link, title, pre-text, and post-text - allowing user to define a non-standard format&gt;
| date      = &lt;Optional date parameter to be displayed at end of 'title' and/or in cat-date&gt;
| cat       = &lt;Category to include page in&gt;
}}&lt;/pre&gt;

Categories are ignored if the template is used on a talk page or on any other non-book page.

The value specified via &lt;code&gt;|cat=&lt;/code&gt; must be in wikicode, including square brackets.

{{tl|{{PAGENAME}}}} is intended to simplify the linking process to files at the Internet Archive &quot;[[w:Wayback Machine|Wayback Machine]]&quot;. 

:''Additionally, {{tl|Cite web}} provides an [[Template:Cite web#Optional parameters|archiveurl]]''

== Parameters ==
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Wayback|url=}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Wayback|url=|title=|date=}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

;url: The URL of the link that is being referenced in the Internet Archives.
;title &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;(optional)&lt;/span&gt;: The text label for the external link. If this is omitted, a generic 'Archive copy' label will be used.
;date &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;(optional, but recommended)&lt;/span&gt;: The Internet Archive timestamp (&lt;code&gt;YYYYMMDDhhmmss&lt;/code&gt;) for the date of the archived page that is to be displayed. If provided, the Template will format the date and display it : Month-name, day-number, year.  If omitted, the history of the referenced page will be listed instead.  You must use the full 4 digits for the year, and 2 digits for month, day, hour minute and second.  use leading zeros if necessary, and use a 24 hour clock for the time.

== Examples ==
;Link to page history, using a generic label:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Wayback |url=http://example.org/ }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;→ &lt;span style=&quot;background:white&quot;&gt;{{Wayback |url=http://example.org/ }}&lt;/span&gt;

;Link to page history, using a title rather than the generic label:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Wayback |url=http://example.org/ |title=Example Title }} &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;→ &lt;span style=&quot;background:white&quot;&gt;{{Wayback |url=http://example.org/ |title=Example Title }}&lt;/span&gt;

;Link to page history using a title, and displaying a particular archived date (2005-01-07, at 12&amp;#58;30 pm and 45 seconds.):&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Wayback |url=http://example.org/ |title=Example Title |date=20050107123045 }} &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;→ &lt;span style=&quot;background:white&quot;&gt;{{Wayback |url=http://example.org/ |title=Example Title |date=20050107123045 }}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|category handler}} meta-template.

It helps other templates to automate both categorization and category suppression. 

Already when used with its default settings this template prevents auto-categorization in some namespaces and on some pages where we usually don't want categorization. Thus even the most basic usage like &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{category handler|[[Category:Somecat]]}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; sees to that templates don't auto-categorize in the wrong places.

This template makes it easy to choose in what namespaces a template should and should not categorize. And it makes it easy to use different categories in different namespaces. And this template uses a central blacklist where we can add pages and page types where templates should not auto-categorize.

=== When not to use this template ===

If a template only needs to categorize in one of the namespaces main (books), file (images) or category, then using this template is overkill. Then instead use one of {{tl|main other}}, {{tl|file other}}, or {{tl|category other}}. But if your template needs to categorize in any other namespace, then we recommend you use this template, since it provides proper category suppression and makes it easy to select how to categorize in the different namespaces.

=== Namespaces ===

This template detects and groups all the different [[WB:NS|namespaces]] used on Wikibooks into several types. These types are used as parameter names in this template.

:'''main''' = Main space, as in normal Wikibooks books.
:'''wikijunior''' = [[Wikijunior]] books.
:'''cookbook''' = Content in the [[Cookbook:Table of Contents|Cookbook]].
:'''talk''' = Any discussion page, such as page names that start with &quot;Talk:&quot;, &quot;User talk:&quot;, &quot;File talk:&quot; and so on.
:'''user''', '''wikibooks''', '''file''', '''mediawiki''', '''template''', '''help''', '''category''', '''subject''', and '''transwiki''' = The other namespaces except the discussion pages.
:'''other''' = Any namespaces that were not specified as a parameter to the template. See examples below.

=== Basic usage ===

This template takes two or more parameters. Here's an example with the full template code for an article message box:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{ambox
| text = This is a box used in books.
}}{{category handler
| [[Category:Somecat]]
| nocat = {{{nocat|}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;nocat=true/false&quot; works--&gt;
}}&lt;noinclude&gt;

{{documentation}}
&lt;!--Add categories and interwikis to the /doc subpage--&gt;
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The above example uses the default settings for {{tl|category handler}}. That means the box will categorize on pages in the following namespaces: 
:'''main''', '''wikijunior''', '''cookbook''', '''file''', '''help''', '''category''', and '''subject'''
But it will ''not'' categorize in the following namespaces:
:'''talk''', '''user''', '''wikibooks''', '''mediawiki''', '''transwiki''', and '''template'''

And it will ''not'' categorize on blacklisted pages. (See section [[#Blacklist|blacklist]] below.)

The reason this template does not categorize in some of the namespaces is that in those namespaces most templates are just demonstrated or listed, not used. Thus most templates should not categorize in those namespaces. 

Any template that is meant for one or more of the namespaces where this template categorizes can use the basic syntax as shown above.

=== Advanced usage ===

This template takes one or more parameters named after the different page types as listed in section [[#Namespaces|namespaces]] above. By using those parameters you can specify exactly in which namespaces your template should categorize. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{mbox
| text = This is a box for articles and talk pages.
}}{{category handler
| main = [[Category:Somecat1]]   &lt;!--Categorize in main (book) space--&gt;
| talk = [[Category:Somecat2]]   &lt;!--Categorize in talk space--&gt;
| nocat = {{{nocat|}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;nocat=true&quot; works--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The above box will only categorize in main and talk space. But it will not categorize on /archive pages since they are blacklisted. (See section [[#Blacklist|blacklist]] below.) And if you need to demonstrate (discuss) that box on a talkpage, then you can feed &quot;&lt;code&gt;nocat=true&lt;/code&gt;&quot; to prevent that template from categorizing. (See section [[#Nocat|nocat]] below.) Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
== My new template ==
Hey guys, have you seen my new template?
{{mytemp|nocat=true}}
Nice, isn't it?
--~~~~
&lt;/pre&gt;

Sometimes we want to use the same category in several namespaces, then do like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{mbox
| text = This is a box used in several namespaces.
}}{{category handler
| main = [[Category:Somecat1]]
| 1 = [[Category:Somecat2]]   &lt;!--For help and user space--&gt;
| help = 1
| user = 1
| talk =     &lt;!--No categories on talk pages--&gt;
| other = [[Category:Somecat3]]   &lt;!--For all other namespaces--&gt;
| nocat = {{{nocat|}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;nocat=true/false&quot; works--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the above example we use a numbered parameter to feed one of the categories, and then we tell this template to use that numbered parameter for both the help and user space.

This template understands the numbered parameters 1 to 10.

The '''other''' parameter defines what should be used in the remaining namespaces that have not explicitly been fed data.

Note the empty but defined '''talk''' parameter. That stops this template from showing what has been fed to the '''other''' parameter, when in talk space.

This template also has a parameter called '''all'''. It works like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{mbox
| text = This is a box used in all namespaces.
}}{{category handler
| all = [[Category:Somecat1]]   &lt;!--Categorize in all namespaces--&gt;
| nocat = {{{nocat|}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;nocat=true/false&quot; works--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The above example will categorize in all namespaces, but not on blacklisted pages. If you want to demonstrate that box on a page, then use &quot;&lt;code&gt;nocat=true&lt;/code&gt;&quot; to prevent the template from categorizing. 

We suggest avoiding the '''all''' parameter, since templates should preferably only categorize in the namespaces they need to.

The all parameter can also be combined with the rest of the parameters. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{mbox
| text = This is a box used in all namespaces.
}}{{category handler
| all = [[Category:Somecat1]]   &lt;!--Categorize in all namespaces--&gt;
| main = [[Category:Somecat2]]   &lt;!--And add this in main space--&gt;
| other = [[Category:Somecat3]]   &lt;!--And add this in all other namespaces--&gt;
| nocat = {{{nocat|}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;nocat=true/false&quot; works--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the above box is placed on an article, then it will add the categories &quot;Somecat1&quot; and &quot;Somecat2&quot;. But on all other types of pages it will instead add &quot;Somecat1&quot; and &quot;Somecat3&quot;. As the example shows, the all parameter works independently of the rest of the parameters.

=== Subpages ===

This template understands the '''subpage''' parameter. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{category handler
| subpage = no    &lt;!--Don't categorize on subpages--&gt;
| wikibooks = [[Category:Somecat]]
| nocat = {{{nocat|}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;nocat=true/false&quot; works--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If &quot;&lt;code&gt;subpage=no&lt;/code&gt;&quot; then this template will ''not'' categorize on subpages. For the rare occasion you ''only'' want to categorize on subpages, then use &quot;&lt;code&gt;subpage=only&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. If '''subpage''' is empty or undefined then this template categorizes both on basepages and on subpages.

=== Blacklist ===

This template has a blacklist of the pages and page types where templates should not auto-categorize. Thus templates that use this meta-template will for instance not categorize on /archive pages and on the subpages of [[Wikipedia:Template messages]].

If you want a template to categorize on a blacklisted page, then feed &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;nocat = false&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; to the template when you place it on the page, thus skipping the blacklist check. Note that this template only categorizes if it has data for the namespace. For instance, if the basic syntax is used (see [[#Basic usage|basic usage]] above), then even if you set &quot;&lt;code&gt;nocat = false&lt;/code&gt;&quot; the template will not categorize on a discussion page, since it has no data for discussion pages. But it has data for help space, so on a blacklisted help page it will categorize.

The blacklist is in the sub-template {{tl|category handler/blacklist}}. To see or update the blacklist, go there.

=== The &quot;nocat&quot; parameter ===

This template understands the '''nocat''' parameter:

* If &quot;&lt;code&gt;nocat = true&lt;/code&gt;&quot; then this template does ''not'' categorize. 
* If '''nocat''' is empty or undefined then this template categorizes as usual. 
* If &quot;&lt;code&gt;nocat = false&lt;/code&gt;&quot; this template categorizes even when on blacklisted pages. (See section [[#Blacklist|blacklist]] above.)

Templates that use {{tl|category handler}} should forward '''nocat''', so they too understand '''nocat'''. The code &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;nocat = {{{nocat|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; shown in the examples on this page does that.

=== The &quot;categories&quot; parameter ===

For backwards compatibility this template also understands the '''categories''' parameter. It works the same as '''nocat'''. Like this:

* If &quot;&lt;code&gt;categories  = no&lt;/code&gt;&quot; then this template does ''not'' categorize. 
* If '''categories''' is empty or undefined then this template categorizes as usual. 
* If &quot;&lt;code&gt;categories = yes&lt;/code&gt;&quot; this template categorizes even when on blacklisted pages.

When adding this template to a template that already uses the &quot;&lt;code&gt;categories = no&lt;/code&gt;&quot; logic, then you can do like this to not break any existing usage:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{category handler
| [[Category:Somecat]]
| nocat = {{{nocat|}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;nocat=true/false&quot; works--&gt;
| categories = {{{categories|}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;categories=no&quot; works--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== The &quot;category2&quot; parameter ===

For backwards compatibility this template kind of supports the old &quot;category =&quot; parameter. But the parameter name &quot;category&quot; is already used in this template to feed category data for when in category space. So instead this template uses '''category2''' for the usage similar to '''nocat'''. Like this:

* If &quot;&lt;code&gt;category2 =&lt;/code&gt;&quot; (empty but defined), or &quot;&lt;code&gt;category2 = no&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, or if '''category2''' is fed any other data (except as described in the next two points), then this template does ''not'' categorize.
* If '''category2''' is undefined or if &quot;&lt;code&gt;category2 = ¬&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, then this template categorizes as usual.
* If &quot;&lt;code&gt;category2 = yes&lt;/code&gt;&quot; this template categorizes even when on blacklisted pages.

When adding this template to a template that already uses the &quot;&lt;code&gt;category =&lt;/code&gt;&quot; logic, then you can do like this to not break any existing usage:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{category handler
| [[Category:Somecat]]
| nocat = {{{nocat|}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;nocat=true/false&quot; works--&gt;
| category2 = {{{category|¬}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;category =&quot; works--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that the &quot;&lt;code&gt;¬&lt;/code&gt;&quot; is necessary, it helps this template to detect if the '''category''' parameter is defined but empty, or undefined.

=== Categories and text ===

Besides from categories, you can feed anything else to this template, for instance some text. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{tmbox
| text = This is a talk page message box.
}}{{category handler
| talk = [[Category:Somecat]]
| other = :::::This template should only be used on talk pages.
| nocat = {{{nocat|}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;nocat=true/false&quot; works--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

When the template above is shown on anything else than a talk page, it will look like this (note the text below the box):

{{tmbox
| text = This is a talk page message box.
| nocat = true    &lt;!--So this box doesn't add &quot;Category:Talk message boxes&quot;--&gt;
}}{{category handler
| talk = [[Category:Somecat]]
| other = :::::This template should only be used on talk pages.
| nocat = {{{nocat|}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;nocat=true/false&quot; works--&gt;
}}

That text will not show on blacklisted pages, so don't use this method to show any important information. Feeding &quot;&lt;code&gt;nocat = true&lt;/code&gt;&quot; to the template hides the text, just as it suppresses any categories.

=== The &quot;page&quot; parameter ===

For testing and demonstration purposes this template can take a parameter named '''page'''. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{category handler
| main = Category:Some cat
| talk = Category:Talk cat
| nocat = {{{nocat|}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;nocat=true/false&quot; works--&gt;
| page = User talk:Example
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the above code we on purpose left out the brackets around the category names so we see the output on the page. No matter on what kind of page the code above is used it will return this:

:{{category handler
| main = Category:Some cat
| talk = Category:Talk cat
| nocat = {{{nocat|}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;nocat=true/false&quot; works--&gt;
| page = User talk:Example
}}

The '''page''' parameter makes this template behave exactly as if on that page. Even the blacklist works. The page name doesn't have to be an existing page.

If the '''page''' parameter is empty or undefined, the name of the current page determines the result.

You can make it so your template also understands the '''page''' parameter. That means you can test how your template will categorize on different pages, without having to actually edit those pages. Then do like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{category handler
| main = Category:Some cat
| talk = Category:Talk cat
| nocat = {{{nocat|}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;nocat=true/false&quot; works--&gt;
| page = {{{page|}}}   &lt;!--For testing--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Parameters ===

List of all parameters:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{category handler
| [[Category:Somecat]]
| subpage = no / only
| 1 =
...
| 10 =
| all = [[Category:Somecat]] / Text
| main = 1 / ... / 10 / [[Category:Somecat]] / Text
...
| other = 1 / ... / 10 / [[Category:Somecat]] / Text

| nocat = {{{nocat|}}} / true / false
| categories = {{{categories|}}} / no / yes
| category2 = {{{category|¬}}} / 'empty' / no / 'not defined' / ¬ / yes

| page  = {{{page|}}} / User:Example
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that empty values to the &quot;main&quot; ... &quot;other&quot; parameters have special meaning (see examples above). The &quot;all&quot; parameter doesn't understand numbered parameters, since there should never be a need for that.

=== Technical details ===
The centralized category suppression blacklist is in the sub-template {{tl|category handler/blacklist}}. To see or update the blacklist, go there.

For its internal parameter processing, this template uses the sub-template {{tl|category handler/numbered}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{documentation subpage}}
&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|category handler/blacklist}} sub-template.

Do not use this template directly, use {{tl|category handler}} instead. This template is called from {{tl|category handler}}, see user documentation there.

But if you came here to see or update the '''category suppression blacklist''', then you are in the right place.

=== Updating the blacklist ===

This template contains a blacklist of the pages and page types where templates should not auto-categorize. This blacklist is used by {{tl|category handler}} to decide when not to categorize. To update the blacklist, edit this template.

This template uses {{tl|if pagename}} to do the pagename-detection, thus see {{tl|if pagename}} for the syntax to use for the blacklist rules.

When this template is placed on a page that should not categorize, then it should return &quot;hide&quot;. And when placed on any other page it should return an empty string.

=== Testing the blacklist ===

There are two ways you can test what this blacklist returns for a page:

You can put this template on the page you want to test, and see what output it produces. You can use edit preview, no need to save. Like this:

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;+{{category handler/blacklist}}+&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Which here on this page returns this:

:+{{category handler/blacklist}}+

The ++ used here is a simple way to make it visible when a template returns an empty string.

Or you can feed the page name you want to test to this template. Like this:
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;+{{category handler/blacklist| page = User:Example }}+&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;+{{category handler/blacklist| page = User:Example/Archive 5}}+&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Which returns this:

:+{{category handler/blacklist| page = User:Example }}+
:+{{category handler/blacklist| page = User:Example/Archive 5 }}+

=== Technical details ===

Currently this template is only called from {{tl|category handler}}, and indirectly from all templates that use {{tl|category handler}}. But in the future this template might also be directly called from other templates similar to {{tl|category handler}}. This means we can update the category suppression blacklist in one place.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|category handler/numbered}} sub-template.

Do not use this template directly, use {{tl|category handler}} instead. This template is called from {{tl|category handler}}, see user documentation there.

The rest of the sections here are only for those that want to understand the internal workings of this template.

=== Technical details ===

This sub-template makes it possible for its parent-template to take input in two forms:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{category handler
| 1 = Input
| main = 1
| talk = 1   &lt;!--Reusing &quot;Input&quot; for both the main and talk parameters--&gt;
}}

{{category handler
| main = Input1
| talk = Input2   &lt;!--Instead feeding text directly to the talk parameter--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This sub-template takes a bunch of numbered parameters. There's no limit to the number of parameters it can use, other than what the servers and MediaWiki system can handle.

It also takes a parameter named '''data'''. If '''data''' is a number, then it returns the data of the corresponding numbered parameter. If '''data''' is something else, for instance a category name, then it returns data unchanged.

Here's how you would normally call this sub-template:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{category handler/numbered
| 1 = {{{1|}}}
| 2 = {{{2|}}}
| 3 = {{{3|}}}
| 4 = {{{4|}}}
| data = Input can be a number between 1-4, or something else.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the above example, since the parent-template feeds only 1-4, then only the numbers 1-4 will work properly. Feeding other numbers will return an empty string.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Documentation subpage}}
{{Tl|Citation needed}} (also known by the redirects {{Tl|Cn}} and {{Tl|Fact}}) is a [[Wikipedia:Template messages|template]] used to identify questionable claims that lack a [[Wikipedia:Citing sources|citation]] to a reliable source. The template produces a superscripted notation like the following:

:Humphrey Bogart has won several snooker world championships.{{Citation needed|date={{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}}}

===Usage===
You may append a date to the template in the following format:
:&lt;code&gt;{{Tlx|Citation needed|date{{=}}{{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}}}&lt;/code&gt;

'''Notes''':
* Substitution of this template will automatically fill the date parameter.
* The date parameter consists of the name of the current month and the year only, not full dates. The names of the months are capitalized in English. ''Any deviation from these two rules will result in an &quot;invalid date parameter&quot; error.''

It is also recommended to add the (non-displayed) {{para|reason}} parameter to leave a better record for future editors. For example, the following usage might be appropriate to the claim that &quot;Humphrey Bogart has won several snooker world championships.&quot;:
:&lt;code&gt;{{Tlx|Citation needed|reason{{=}}please give a reliable source for this assertion. I thought he was an actor.}}&lt;/code&gt;

Adding this template to an article places the article into [[:Category:Pages needing sources‎]].

Please remove the template when you add a citation for a statement.

===Examples===
:&lt;code&gt;This sentence shows the template used at the end.{{Tlx|Citation needed|reason{{=}}reliable source needed for the whole sentence}}&lt;/code&gt;

''The above wikitext will render as follows:''

:This sentence shows the template used at the end.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date={{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}}}

The template should be inserted ''after'' punctuation, such as a period or comma.
&lt;!--
:&lt;code&gt;While this example{{Tlx|Citation needed|2=1=shows the template}} used to request a citation for a specific part of a sentence.&lt;/code&gt;

''The above wikitext will render as follows:''

While this example {{Citation needed|1=shows the template}} used to request a citation for a specific part of a sentence.
 --&gt;

===When not to use this template===
Unsourced or poorly sourced contentious material about living persons should be '''removed immediately'''. Do not tag it: immediately remove it.

Material that is doubtful and harmful may be removed immediately, rather than tagged.

The &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cn}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template is intended for use when there is a general question of the verifiability of a statement, or when an editor believes that a reference verifying the statement should be provided. Other templates are available for other or more specific issues, see the [[:Category:Inline cleanup templates|list of inline templates]]. Being specific about the nature of the problem will help other editors correct it.

If you have the time and ability to find an authoritative reference, please do so. Then add the citation yourself, or correct the page text. After all, the ultimate goal is not to merely identify problems, but to fix them.

While an editor may add this template to any uncited passage for any reason, many editors object to what they perceive as overuse of this tag, particularly in what is known as &quot;drive-by&quot; tagging, which is applying the tag without attempting to address the issues at all. Consider whether adding this tag in a page is the best approach before using it, and use it judiciously. Wikibooks' [[WB:OR|original research policy]] does '''not require''' reliable sources for common facts (e.g., &quot;The Moon orbits the Earth&quot;), or that citations be repeated through every sentence in a paragraph. All direct quotations and facts whose accuracy might be challenged (e.g., statistics) require citations.

This template is intended for specific passages that need citation. For entire pages or sections that contain significant material lacking sources (rather than just specific short passages), there are other, more appropriate templates, such as {{Tl|Unreferenced}} or {{Tl|Refimprove}}.

=== How to respond to this tag ===
The addition of this tag is a request for an inline citation to support the tagged statement.  If you are able to provide a citation to support the claim, then please do so.  

Except for certain kinds of claims about living people, which require immediate production of inline citations, there is no specific deadline for providing citations. Please do not delete information that you believe is correct simply because no-one has provided a citation within an arbitrary time limit. Where there is some uncertainty about its accuracy, most editors are willing to wait about a month to see whether a citation can be provided.

== Introduction ==
Images play a major part in helping readers and listeners to comprehend and learn about ideas, concepts, and systems. They help people focus on a particular topic and can be used to generate conversation, deeper thought, and emotional reactions that lead to a greater likelihood that what they have learned will be absorbed and applied. User-generated content can benefit greatly by the inclusion of images that clarify, extend thinking, and offer perspective, as well as images that add to the readability and enjoyment of text.

When using images in user-created content, care should be taken that images are used with appropriate permission, a requirement that is most difficult to meet when publishing content that is to be freely shared on the Internet. There are a number of options for obtaining images to enhance user-generated content. In addition, users may create their own images as part of the process for creating user-generated content; that is, user-generated images created for  user-generated content.

This page will describe the types of image licenses that are available, how they might be used in user-generated content, and information about some particularly useful sites for obtaining images.

== Types of Licenses ==

The world of images can be a confusing one. How can users find what they need and make sure that it is legal to use what they find?

The first step would be to identify sources of images and what kind of licensing is being used. Images in the '''public domain'''&lt;ref&gt;en.wikipedia.org. ''Public Domain.'' Retrieved October 18, 2011 from:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain&lt;/ref&gt; may be used freely. There is no longer copyright on the image, or the creator of the image has released the image to the public domain. You can change the image and use it for any purpose. However, you should remember that giving credit to the creator of the image for his work may be needed for academic integrity, especially if the image includes content.

Some images are published with a '''Creative Commons'''&lt;ref&gt;en.wikipedia.org. ''Creative Commons.'' Retrieved October 18, 2011 from:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_commons&lt;/ref&gt; license, which will provide a certain set of privileges to users of those images.

'''Provider-Supplied License.''' Other image collections may reside on their own website and be controlled by a license that is published at that site. These licenses can be wildly different from each other, ranging from those that are similar to &quot;public domain&quot; to those that allow free use of images only in certain, unusual situations.

'''Commercial License.''' There are numerous companies that sell images and establish specific rules for use of what has been sold. It is possible to purchase images that may be used in user-generated content.

'''Copyrighted images.''' If an image has not been released to the public domain or given a Creative Commons or provider-supplied license, the creator or the company that purchased the rights to that image still will maintain the usual copyright privileges. Use of the images requires permission from the owner of the copyright. That permission can be obtained by writing to the owner of the image or purchasing the rights through the company's website.

'''Be careful.''' There is no guarantee that images that were uploaded by users are actually in the public domain, or have a Creative Commons license. If you suspect that an image does not belong to the person or organization that has stored that image, you might want to avoid using it.

'''Fair Use.''' If an image is to be used within a classroom setting for educational reasons, there may be some legal ability to use even commercial images. Standards of fair use must be applied.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Government Copyright Office. ''Fair Use.'' Retrieved October 18, 2011 from:   http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, though, using images for which free use has been provided will be a better strategy when creating user-generated content, especially that which is published on the Internet.

== Public Domain Images ==
[[File:CassiopeiaNASAPIA03519.jpg|thumb|NASA photograph in public domain. The supernova remnant Cassiopeia.]]

Images that are public domain can be freely used, without attribution, for your own personal use, for publication, on web pages, or for commercial projects. 

When you look for pubic domain images, remember that &quot;free&quot; does not necessarily equal &quot;public domain.&quot; Some images that can be used for free have an accompanying use requirement that might ''not'' include posting on the web, commercial use, or on Wiki Foundation sites.

A large number of images are available on U.S. government sites because images originally produced by the U.S. government are considered to be in the public domain.

Listings of U.S. government photos and images: http://www.usa.gov/Topics/Graphics.shtml
Sample collection from the National Zoo: http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/PhotoGallery/

Open Clip Library has a collection of images that were placed in the Public Domain: http://www.openclipart.org/about[[File:cheeseburger1310544885.png|thumb|left|Open Clip Art Library public domain image license through Creative Commons]]

You can read the Wikipedia article about Open Clip Library here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Clip_Art_Library and see a list of potential public domain collections here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Public_domain_image_resources

People can also take photos of art that is out of copyright and place the photo in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, J. (2010, September 21). ''When it's Illegal to Photograph Artwork.'' [Blog post]. Retrieved October 18, 2011 from:   http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/21/when-its-illegal-to-photograph-artwork/s&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creative Commons Images ==
Creative Commons provides a way for users to designate the kind of licensing they wish to assign to their own work. Take a look at the descriptions of the Creative Commons licenses: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/

The organization also assists those who wish to assign public domain to their work.&lt;ref&gt;Creative Commons. ''Our Public Domain Tools.'' Retrieved October 18, 2011 from:   //http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/&lt;/ref&gt;
 
If you want to search for images with Creative Commons licensing, try http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/ or http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Image

Another site that lets you locate Creative Commons licensed images, but also displays images that have commercial or some other kind of licensing: http://everystockphoto.com

== Provider-Supplied License Images ==

A number of sites on the Internet provide collections of images that can be used in user-generated content. If selecting from one of these sites, make sure that you read the licensing agreement. Sometimes there are generous conditions, where you can use the image on a web site that you create, in a book you publish, in presentations, even for a client. Other times, the license is more limited, confined to personal use.

Some of the images from this category of image collections should not be uploaded for use in a WikiBook page.
For example, if you locate this  photo on stock.xchng at http://www.sxc.hu/photo/1354752 and read about the license, you'll see that you can use it for yourself, on a web site, or for a client. However, it can't be posted in Wikibooks. Wiki Foundation only allows users to upload and use an image on a wiki page if the image is owned by person who uploaded the image, if it has a specific kind of Creative Commons, Share Alike 3.0 license, if the image was created by the U.S. government, and some other specialized situations. See the section on Images and Wikipedia below for more information. &lt;ref&gt;en.wikipedia.org. ''Images.'' Retrieved October 16, 2011 from:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Images&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sites provide images that are free for certain types of uses:
* [http://www.stockvault.net stockvault]. 
* [http://www.morguefile.com/archive/ morguefile]

Both sites above provide some high quality images and generous granting of rights for users to publish the images. Generally, you do not have the rights to distribute the image and you do not own the copyright.

There are also sites that allow users with accounts to upload images and to indicate what kind of licensing they will assign. Some could be added to content without cost.

An example:

* [http://www.flickr.com/ Flickr.com] 

If you want to search for images with Creative Commons licensing, try http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/ or http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Image

For more information on obtaining free use of images for user-generated content, check out [http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/web/12-best-places-to-get-free-images-for-your-site-624818 12-best-places-to-get-free-images-for-your-site]

== Commercial Images ==
Commercial images are obtained at a cost and include specific rights for usage. Those rights can range from personal use only to posting on web sites. Copyright usually stays with the owner of image, though it might be possible to purchase not only the use of the image but the copyright itself.

Many of these images are of great quality and you can find what you want efficiently. If you don't need an image in high resolution, the cost tends to be less.

As with provider-provided licensing, you need to read the terms of agreement to make sure you can use the image as you plan. 

In some situations, especially for adults, purchasing these images makes sense. If it saves a lot of time and effort, you are very satisfied with the appearance or functionality of the image within what you are publishing, and the licensing allows you to easily share user-generated content, spending some money on the images could be an option.

Examples of commercial image sites:

* http://us.fotolia.com
* http://www.dreamstime.com/
* http://www.istockphoto.com/

== Images and Wikipedia ==
[[File:TroutHall.jpg|thumb|Photo uploaded and donated to Wikimedia and given a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license]]
Wikipedia and associated Wiki Foundation sites like WikiBooks require that user-created images are uploaded by registered users. If you are using a Wiki Foundation site to contribute images, you'll need to establish an account then upload the images you wish to use. In general, all images must be created by you, in the public domain, or available through a Creative Commons type of license. 

After signing into Wikimedia Commons, for example, you may choose the Upload file option the is available on the left hand side of the screen. Wikimedia Commons requires that you provide copyright information for the image, since you are are actually agreeing to share it with everyone. 

''This is the language that is used on that agreement page:''

:This file is my own work.
:
:I,___________ , the copyright holder of this work, hereby irrevocably grant anyone the right to use this work for any purpose, as long as they credit me and share derivative work under the same terms.

:I,______________ , the copyright holder of this work, hereby publish this work under the following license:

''You then can choose between these three Creative Commons licenses:''

* Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 3.0
* Creative Commons Attribution 3.0
* Public domain (all rights waived with Creative Commons Zero license)&lt;ref&gt;commons.wikimedia.org. ''Upload Wizard.'' Retrieved October 18, 2011 from:   http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:UploadWizard&lt;/ref&gt;


If you choose &quot;This file is not my own work,&quot; you may still be able to upload the image. For instance, you can upload an image that has been published under a Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 2.0, original work of the US Federal Government, or a photograph of original artwork that is now in the public domain.

Once the upload is complete, you will be given a line of code for your wiki page that will allow you to use the image within a page you are creating. You will also be given a URL, which will be helpful in sharing your image with others.

For more information about uploading and using images from Wikipedia Commons, take a look at [[w:Wikipedia:Uploading_images|this article.]]

If you do start an account and log in, you can also see information about this on [[Commons:Special:UploadWizard|Commons Upload Wizard]].

== Usage ==

Add {{tl|dubious}} after ''a specific statement or alleged fact'' that is subject to dispute (your own or someone else's).

For an entire disputed page, use {{tl|disputed}}.

It is best to simultaneously try to resolve the dispute on the discussion page. To refer to a specific discussion page section, use {{tlx|dubious|discussion page section name}}. If the dispute does not have a discussion page section yet (e.g. because it has been argued in edit summaries), please create one. 

This template is ''not'' for flagging items that an editor simply thinks might be incorrect or unsourced. This is what {{tl|citation needed}} is for. It is for statements ''that are subject to ongoing dispute'' among editors, e.g. due to conflicting sources or doubts about sources' reliability.  The purposes of this template are:
* To warn readers that a statement in the text may not be accurate 
* To alert editors that additional sources need to be found, to ascertain which of the conflicting views in the dispute is more authoritative

Do not add this template to a page more than a reasonable number of times.  Please consider voicing concerns on the discussion page instead.

=== Parameters ===

*'''date''': the month and year when the template was added. Like this: {{tlx|dubious|date{{=}}{{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}}}
* It is also common to use a dummy {{para|reason}} parameter to add a little extra explanation.

== Why have this template? ==
{{edit protected|answered=yes}}
Why is this template necessary? And why is it protected? This template is important on Wikipedia, but I can see no good use for it here. Plus it has only [http://toolserver.org/~dispenser/cgi-bin/embeddedincount.py?db=enwikibooks&amp;title=Template%3ADubious 11 transclusions]. This template should definitely be unprotected, and possibly even deleted.

:If you feel a template should be deleted, an RFD is the answer.  But this differs from &quot;citation needed/fact&quot; if you look at the description on the content page where it notes the intricacies regarding the templates' differences. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 18:38, 17 June 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">= When to optimize =

{{wikipedia|Program_optimization#When_to_optimize}}
A common pitfall is to be obsessed with optimization, to the point of spending a lot of coding time on tiny optimization, while complexifying the code and making it harder to debug.

Make sure you optimize when you have evidence that the impacted code truly slows down the application.  Make measurements.  Compare in different use cases and possibly different hardware.

Also, we recommend that when implementing a new feature, you write your first version as clear as possible, and optimize it in a second step when the feature works correctly.

= Measuring frame time =

A common way to measure performance in applications is by the use of FPS, or Frames Per Second.  However, because of the definition of FPS itself (frames / 1 second), it does not fully convey performance because of its non-linearity.  There are many pages around the web that fully describe this, but the basic idea is this:  A linear change in FPS does not result in a linear change in actual performance.  A 450 FPS drop from 900 FPS is about 1 millisecond extra time, but a 5 FPS drop from 60 FPS is about.. 1 millisecond extra time. The amount of performance decrease is inversely related to the amount of FPS lost, so as FPS tends towards 0, execution time starts growing out of control fast.  Yet, you only see a linear change in FPS, so you just shrug this off.

Instead, you should use frame time, or the amount of time needed to render 1 frame.  Although it may seem counter-intuitive, it provides a reliable way to measure if code is causing a bottleneck.

Here's a simple code to display the amount of time taken per frame (measured in milliseconds) on the console:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* Global */
static unsigned int fps_start = 0;
static unsigned int fps_frames = 0;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* init_resources() */
  fps_start = glutGet(GLUT_ELAPSED_TIME);
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* idle() */
  /* FPS count */
  {
    fps_frames++;
    int delta_t = glutGet(GLUT_ELAPSED_TIME) - fps_start;
    if (delta_t &gt; 1000) {
      cout &lt;&lt; delta_t / fps_frames &lt;&lt; endl;
      fps_frames = 0;
      fps_start = glutGet(GLUT_ELAPSED_TIME);
    }
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

= Vertical sync =

Often, OpenGL is configured to wait for the physical screen's vertical refresh before pushing the new color buffer:
* this prevents tearing, a visual artifact that mixes part of the previous buffer with part of the new one
* there is no visual need to display more frames than what the screen can handle, typically 60-75Hz (depending on the screen)
* this saves resources such as the battery

However, this means that even if we can display 200 FPS, our application will be capped to 60-75 FPS, which makes it difficult to measure the performances.

In such case, it can be useful to disable the vertical sync:
* your graphic card driver may come with utilities to enable and disable it
* with Mesa, you can start your application with &lt;code&gt;vblank_mode=0&lt;/code&gt;, or configure this behavior more permanently in &lt;code&gt;~/.drirc&lt;/code&gt;; some earlier versions have bugs, so you may have to try both.

= Stencil buffer tests =

See performances tips in the [[../Stencil_buffer#Performances|Stencil buffer]] section.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As we face the excitement of new scientific discoveries and the challenges these pose, it is necessary that we equip ourselves with a good understanding of scientific ideas. A really good knowledge base will allow us to make decisions free of superstition and misinformation as the 21st century proceeds. 

Biology is a fascinating subject dealing with the living world. This is text is based on the latest New Zealand Curriculum to ensure it is sustainable in the changing face of New Zealand education.

The open source nature of this text empowers learners to actively contribute and participate in the learning process. Success in science depends on what happens during the journey, rather than the destination and this open source alternative learning resource will engage senior science learners, nurturing, inspiring and empowering a new generation of passionate global citizens in this rapidly changing world.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== When lacking caterpillars ==

Unfortunately having information about the appearance of the caterpillars seems crucial for identification, and all I have are the moths.  Would there be any way to make the key more useful to those without knowledge of the larvae?

== Linking to Wikipedia articles ==

Hi, I notice that you recently added some links to article in Wikipedia.  There is an easier way to make such links - &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:article name|your title]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; - this way you don't need to write out the full web address and only the title of the article.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 10:45, 24 October 2011 (UTC)</text>

In simple terms, essentialism is a generalization stating that certain properties possessed by a group (e.g. people, things, ideas) are universal, and not dependent on context. For example, the statement 'all human beings are mortal' is essentialist.

According to essentialism, a member of a specific group may possess other characteristics that are neither needed to establish its membership nor preclude its membership, but that essences do not simply reflect ways of grouping objects; they also result in properties of the object, as the object can be subjugated to smaller contexts.

Anthropology professor Lawrence Hirschfeld gives an example of what constitutes the essence of a tiger, regardless of whether it is striped or albino, or has lost a leg. The essential properties of a tiger are those without which it is no longer a tiger. Other properties, such as stripes or number of legs, are considered inessential or 'accidental'. [2] Biologist Ernst Mayr epitomizes the effect of such an essentialist character of Platonic forms in biology: &quot;Flesh-and-blood rabbits may vary, but their variations are always to be seen as flawed deviation from the ideal essence of rabbit&quot;. For Mayr, the healthful antithesis of essentialism in biology is &quot;population thinking&quot;.[3]

This view is contrasted with non-essentialism, which states that, for any given kind of entity, there are no specific traits which entities of that kind must possess.

Essentialism came under scrutiny and criticism in the mid to late 20th century by the American pragmatist Richard Rorty

==Petal==
[[File:Julia set for f(z) = z^4 - z with various number of star branches.gif|right|thumb|repelling petals around fixed point and its preimages]]
There is no unified definition of petals.

Petal of a flower can be :
* attracting / repelling
* small/alfa/big/ ( small attracting petals do not ovelap with repelling petals, but big do)  

Each petal is invariant under f^period. In other words it is mapped to itself by f^period.


Attracting petal P is a :
* Each petal is invariant under &lt;math&gt;f^n &lt;/math&gt;. In other words it is mapped to itself by &lt;math&gt;f^n &lt;/math&gt;:  &lt;math&gt;f^n(\overline{P} ) \subset P \cup \left\{ p \right\} &lt;/math&gt;
* [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/def_cqp#Domain|domain]] (topological disc ) containing :
** parabolic periodic point p in its boundary &lt;math&gt;\overline{P} \ni \left\{ p \right\} &lt;/math&gt; ( precisely in its root  , which is a coomon points of all attracting and repelling petals = center of the Lea-Fatou flower)
** critical point or it's n=period images on the other side ( only small ?? )
* '''[[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/def_cqp#Trap|trap]] which captures any orbit tending to parabolic point''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://num.math.uni-goettingen.de/~summer/cheritat.pdf PARABOLIC IMPLOSION A MINI-COURSE by ARNAUD CHERITAT]&lt;/ref&gt;
* set contained inside component of filled-in Julia set. The attracting petals of parabolic fixed point are contained in it's basin of attraction 



Petals &lt;math&gt;P_j&lt;/math&gt;  are symmetric with respect to the d-1 [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/r_a_directions|directions]] :

&lt;math&gt; arg(z) = \frac{2 \Pi l}{d - 1}   &lt;/math&gt;

where :
* d is (to do) &lt;!----  a degree of complex quadratic map so d=2  ----&gt;
* l is from  0 to d-2

Petals can have different size. 

If &lt;math&gt;\lambda^n = 1 &lt;/math&gt; then Julia set should approach parabolic periodic point in n directions, between n petals. &lt;ref&gt;BOF, page 39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Number of petals===
 {{under construction}}
[[File:Bifurcation1-2.png|thumbnail|right|In parabolic point child period coincides with parent period]]

For quadratic polynomials :


Multiplicity = ParentPeriod + ChildPeriod

NumberOfPetals = multiplicity - ParentPeriod

It is because in parabolic case fixed point coincidence with periodic cycle. Length of cycle ( child period) is equal to number of petals

Sum of all petals creates a flower with center at parabolic periodic point.&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Rose (topology)|wikipedia : Rose (topology)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;... an attracting petal is a set of points in a sufficient small disk around the periodic point whose forward orbits always remain in the disk under powers of return map. &quot; ( W P Thurston : On the geometry and dynamics of Iterated rational maps)

* empty ( its interior is empty ) for c outside Mandelbrot set. Julia set is a totally disconnected ( 
* filled cauliflower for c=1/4 on boundary of the Mandelbrot set. Julia set is a Jordan curve ( quasi circle).

&lt;/gallery&gt;




Pleae note that :
* size of image differs because of different z-planes.
* different algorithms are used so colours are hard to compare

===Bifurcation of the Cauliflower===
How Julia set changes along real axis ( going from c=0 thru c=1/4 and futher ) :


'''Perturbation''' of a function &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; by complex &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; :

&lt;math&gt;g(z) = f(z) + \epsilon  &lt;/math&gt;

When one add epsilon &gt; 0  ( move along real axis toward + infinity ) there is a '''bifurcation of parabolic fixed point''' : 
* attracting fixed point ( epsilon&lt;0 )
* one parabolic fixed point ( epsilon = 0 ) 
* one parabolic fixed point splits up into two conjugate repelling fixed points ( epsilon &gt; 0 )

&quot;If we slightly perturb with epsilon&lt;0 then the parabolic fixed point splits up into two real fixed points on the real axis (one attracting, one repelling). &quot;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

All points of interior of filled Julia set tend to one periodic orbit ( or fixed point ). This point is in Julia set and is weakly attracting. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/e-notes/MSet/Local.htm Local dynamics at a fixed point by Evgeny Demidov]&lt;/ref&gt; One can analyse only behevior near parabolic fixed point. It can be done using [[:commons:category:critical orbits|critical orbits]].

There are two cases here : easy and hard.

If the Julia set near parabolic fixed point is like n-th arm star ( not twisted) then one can simply check argument of of zn, relative to the fixed point. See for example z+z^5. This is an easy case.

In the hard case Julia set is twisted around fixed.

One can use only argument of point z of external rays and its distance to alfa fixed point. ( see code from image) It works for periods up to 15 ( maybe more ... )

==Estimation from interior==
Julia set is a boundary of filled-in Julia set Kc. 

* find points of interior of Kc 
* find boundary of interior of Kc using [[Fractals/Computer_graphic_techniques/2D#Edge_detection|edge detection]]

If components of interior are lying very close to each other then find components using :&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/e-notes/MSet/Basin.htm The fixed points and periodic orbits by Evgeny Demidov]&lt;/ref&gt;
 color = LastIteration % period

For parabolic components between parent and child component :&lt;ref&gt;[[:commons:File:Parabolic_Julia_set_from_period_2_thru_internal_angle_1_over_4.png|Src code of c program for drawing parabolic Julia set]]&lt;/ref&gt;
 periodOfChild = denominator*periodOfParent  
 color = iLastIteration % periodOfChild 

where denominator is a denominator of internal angle of parent comonent of Mandelbrot set.
===Angle===

&quot;if the iterate zn of tends to a fixed parabolic point, then the initial seed z0 is classified according to the argument of zn−z0, the classification being provided by the flower theorem &quot; ( Mark McClure &lt;ref&gt;[http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/361205/what-is-the-shape-of-parabolic-critical-orbit stackexchange questions : what-is-the-shape-of-parabolic-critical-orbit]&lt;/ref&gt;)
=== Attraction time ===
[[File:DistanceToFixed.png|right|thumb|Various types of dynamics ]]
Interior of filled Julia set consist of '''components'''. All comonents are preperiodic, some of them are periodic ( immediate basin of attraction).

In other words : 
* one iteration moves z to another component ( and whole component to another component)
* all point of components have the same '''attraction time''' ( number of iteration needed to reach target set around attractor)

It is possible to use it to color components. 
Because in parabolic case attractor is weak ( weakly attracting) it needs a lot of iterations for some points to reach it. 

Here are some example values :
&lt;pre&gt;
 iWidth  = 1001 // width of image in pixels
 PixelWidth  = 0.003996  
 AR  = 0.003996 // Radius around attractor
 denominator  = 1 ; Cx  = 0.250000000000000; Cy  = 0.000000000000000 ax  = 0.500000000000000; ay  = 0.000000000000000   
 denominator  = 2 ; Cx  = -0.750000000000000; Cy  = 0.000000000000000 ax  = -0.500000000000000; ay  = 0.000000000000000   
 denominator  = 3 ; Cx  = -0.125000000000000; Cy  = 0.649519052838329 ax  = -0.250000000000000; ay  = 0.433012701892219  
 denominator  = 4 ; Cx  = 0.250000000000000; Cy  = 0.500000000000000 ax  = 0.000000000000000; ay  = 0.500000000000000   
 denominator  = 5 ; Cx  = 0.356762745781211; Cy  = 0.328581945074458 ax  = 0.154508497187474; ay  = 0.475528258147577   
 denominator  = 6 ; Cx  = 0.375000000000000; Cy  = 0.216506350946110 ax  = 0.250000000000000; ay  = 0.433012701892219    
 
 denominator  = 1 ;   i =               243.000000 
 denominator  = 2 ;   i =            31 171.000000 
 denominator  = 3 ;   i =         3 400 099.000000 
 denominator  = 4 ;   i =       333 293 206.000000 
 denominator  = 5 ;   i =    29 519 565 177.000000 
 denominator  = 6 ;   i = 2 384 557 783 634.000000 
&lt;/pre&gt;

where : 

 C = Cx + Cy*i 
 a = ax + ay*i // fixed point alpha
 i // number of iterations after which critical point z=0.0 reaches disc around fixed point alpha with radius AR
 denominator of internal angle ( in turns )
 internal angle =  1/denominator

Note that attraction time i is proportional to denominator. 
[[File:Distance between point of critical orbit and alfa fixed point in parabolic cases.png|right|thumb|Attraction time for various denominators ]]
Now you see what means '''weakly attracting'''.

One can :
* use brutal force method ( Attracting radius &lt; pixelSize; iteration Max big enough to let all points from interior reach target set; long time or [[Fractals/Computer_graphic_techniques/2D/optimisation#Parallel_computing|fast computer]] )
* find better method (:-)) if time is to long for you

===Interior distance estimation ===


===Trap ===

==Estimation from interior and exterior ==
Julia set is a common boundary of filled-in Julia set and basin of attraction of infinity. 

* find points of interior/components of Kc 
* find escaping points 
* find boundary points using Sobel filter

It works for denominator up to 4.

==Inverse iteration of repelling points ==
[[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/q-iterations#Backward_iteration|Inverse iteration]] of alfa fixed point. It works good only for cuting point ( where external rays land). Other points still are not hitten.


==Bof61==

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The federal interstate system in the United States has created a lasting social and economic impact on the American landscape.  From birth, cities have grown to love and loath the interstate system that became the transportation norm in post-WW II America.  However, by the 1990s, the love affair for building new interstate networks had faded and the focus shifted towards maintaining the status quo.  Despite this shift in policy, the debate to build one last interstate, Interstate 69, continues today.  If fully implemented, Interstate 69 will extend nearly 1,700 miles through a seven state region.   There are a number of issues that have arisen with this proposol and we present these issues as a launching point for discussion on future infrastructure investments and their possible consequences.

==Timeline==
* November 1967: The first segments of the new I-69/US-27 freeway open for public use in Michigan.  The segment of the I-69/US-27 freeway from the Indiana state line northerly to the Branch/Calhoun Co line is certified, and much of the former route of US-27 is turned back to local control on November 1st. The exception is the 3 miles from Fenn Rd northerly to US-12/Chicago St downtown Coldwater, which becomes part of a new BL I-69. Six weeks later, the segment of the I-69/US-27 freeway from the Branch/Calhoun Co line northerly to I-94 at Marshall is certified. Old US-27 remains an unnumbered state highway for several more months. At Marshall, the I-69 designation terminates at I-94, while the US-27 routing turns easterly via I-94 for about 1-1/2 miles back to the original US-27 alignment, then northerly toward Olivet and Charlotte. A brand new BUS US-27 designation is commissioned, beginning at I-69/US-27 on the west side of Marshall (present day Exit 36), and running easterly via Michigan Ave into downtown, then northerly via the former route of US-27 (Kalamazoo Ave &amp; Brewer St) to the junction of I-94 &amp; US-27 north of town at Exit 110. The BL I-94 routing at Marshall is realigned to run westerly from downtown via Michigan Ave (newly co-designated as BUS US-27) to the new I-69/US-27 freeway, then northerly via the freeway to end at I-94. The former routing of BL I-94 northerly from downtown Marshall is redesignated as a part of the new BUS US-27.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bessert&quot; /&gt;

==Narrative==
===National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956===
There were several Federal-Aid Acts passed by legislation to help the interstate system become a priority and begin its birthing phase. The first of these Acts was in 1952, when $25 million was authorized for the construction of the interstate highway system. Then in 1954, another Act was authorized by legislation for $175 million annually for the fiscal years 1956 and 1957. The largest and most aggressive Act to help the interstate system get off the ground came within a year of Dwight Eisenhower becoming President of the United States. The famous Act of 1956 authorized $13.5 billion for the development of the interstate highway system. This Act increased the proposed length to 41,000 miles of interstate highway to be planned for and built.

====Planning====
The need for an interstate highway system in the United States came about early in the 1900s around the time of World War I. It was 1919, when army captain at the time Dwight Eisenhower, along with 294 other members of the army, drove the first motorized caravan across the country. The caravan departed from Washington D.C. arriving 62 days later at their destination of Union Square in San Fransico, Califonia. The caravan averaged roughly 5 miles per hour on this journey due to the terrain they faced along the way &lt;ref name=&quot;M6&quot;&gt;Rosenberg, Matt. &quot;Interstate Highways - An Overview of Interstate Highways.&quot;Geography Home Page - Geography at About.com. Web. 08 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://geography.about.com/od/urbaneconomicgeography/a/interstates.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; . Eisenhower was also inspired for an interstate highway system by his experience during World War II when he noticed the German’s ability to efficiently move forces in a two-front war by the use of the Autobahn &lt;ref name=&quot;M2&quot;&gt;Garrison, William L., and David M. Levinson. The Transportation Experience: Policy, Planning, and Deployment. New York: Oxford UP, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Policy played a huge role in the development of the interstate highway system in the United States. Planning the interstate highway system began in the late 1930s. The Federal-Aid Act of 1938 called the Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) to study the feasibility of a toll financed system of three east-west and three north-south superhighways. This study consisted of a total of about 14,000 miles of national toll road system &lt;ref name=&quot;M2&quot;&gt;Garrison, William L., and David M. Levinson. The Transportation Experience: Policy, Planning, and Deployment. New York: Oxford UP, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;. The study found that the toll network would not be self-supporting and the proposal died. Instead the BPR’s report advocated a 26,700-mile interregional highway network.

It was then in the 1950s when America was threatened with possible nuclear attacks from the Soviet Union, which spurred the need for a national interstate highway system. It was believed that an interstate highway system would allow citizens with evacuation routes if the need ever came &lt;ref name=&quot;M6&quot;&gt;Rosenberg, Matt. &quot;Interstate Highways - An Overview of Interstate Highways.&quot;Geography Home Page - Geography at About.com. Web. 08 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://geography.about.com/od/urbaneconomicgeography/a/interstates.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; . It wasn’t long after that Dwight Eisenhower became president of the United States in 1952 that a push for the interstate system began to grow. It was then in 1956 that the Federal Aid to Highway/Interstate Highway Act (FAHA) was signed and the interstate highways would begin to spread across the country in the years to follow. The first stretch of the interstate highway system opened in Topeka, Kansas and was a total length of about eight-miles. The plan for the interstate highway system was to have all 42,000 miles of interstate highway complete within 16 years. The construction and completion of the originally planned 42,000 miles of interstate highway actually took 27 years to complete, with the last link being Interstate 105 in Los Angeles, which was completed in 1993 &lt;ref name=&quot;M6&quot;&gt;Rosenberg, Matt. &quot;Interstate Highways - An Overview of Interstate Highways.&quot;

====Construction====
The first decade of the interstate highway construction was the most intense period of road building in history. About half of the proposed interstate highway system was opened by the end of 1966, with the system essentially complete by the 1980s &lt;ref name=&quot;M4&quot;&gt;&quot;Interstate System - Design - FHWA.&quot; Home | Federal Highway Administration. U.S. Department of Transportation. Web. 08 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/programadmin/interstate.cfm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. The rapid growth phase was due in large part to the government support it received when Dwight Eisenhower became President of the United States of America. During his first term in office, within his first year, the FAHA was signed and allotted $13.5 billion for the planning and construction of the interstate highway system. 

With the money made available for the construction of the interstate highway system, it was set on the fast track to completion. According to the available data, about 23,500 miles (34,115 km) of the interstate highway system had been completed by the end of 1966. And by 1980, what would be considered the end of the growth phase, roughly 40,250 miles (64,430 km) were finished and opened &lt;ref name=&quot;M7&quot;&gt;&quot;USA Interstate Highway System: Miles Opened by Year.&quot; THE PUBLIC PURPOSE 
(Wendell Cox Consultancy). Web. 09 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.publicpurpose.com/hwy-intmiles.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Some of the previous technologies that were brought together in the interstate highway system were taken from existing roads and highways. Greater emphasis was placed on standards for the construction of the interstate highway system, as it was important to have uniformity throughout the system. The standards were developed and adopted by the FHWA &lt;ref name=&quot;M4&quot;&gt;&quot;Interstate System - Design - FHWA.&quot; Home | Federal Highway Administration. U.S. Department of Transportation. Web. 08 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/programadmin/interstate.cfm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. Similar standards are used in the construction of new interstate highway links.

====Ramifications====
With the growth of the interstate highway system and the increased dominance of the automobile came about urban sprawl. Both private and mass transportation were also dynamically changed due to the interstate highway system. Some of the issues we face even today, many believe, came about as a result of the interstate highway system include issues of economic mobility and growth, problems of sustainability, pollution, congestion and the creation of metropolitan landscapes which lack spatial and cultural harmony &lt;ref name=&quot;M1&quot;&gt;Armbruster, Andrew. &quot;The Interstate Highway System: It's Development and It's Effects on the American Spatial, Economic and Cultural Landscape.&quot; http://www.emich.edu/studentorgs/place/Officers/andrew/Econ%20375%20-%20The%20Construction%20of%20the%20IHS-B.pdf. 5 Apr. 2005. Web. 9 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;. Major shifts in the relationship between the traditionally dominant core cities and the surrounding suburban areas began to evolve. Economies began to shift out from core cities, and population patterns became more focused on suburban areas. 

The interstate highway system is designed with the highway arteries directed towards the core of the economic energy and in accordance with the existing population density. The highway network concentrated itself as it came into downtown areas and expanded as it moved outward from the city limits. A large reason why the highway system network focuses toward the intercity downtown area is because when it was originally built, it was to be able to be used as an evacuation route for citizens if there was ever a situation where people needed to be evacuated from the city &lt;ref name=&quot;M1&quot;&gt;Armbruster, Andrew. &quot;The Interstate Highway System: It's Development and It's Effects on the American Spatial, Economic and Cultural Landscape.&quot; http://www.emich.edu/studentorgs/place/Officers/andrew/Econ%20375%20-%20The%20Construction%20of%20the%20IHS-B.pdf. 5 Apr. 2005. Web. 9 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 ===

On December 18, 1991, President Bush signed the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ITSEA 1991) providing authorizations for highways, highway safety, and mass
transportation for the next 6 years.  Total funding of about $155 billion was appropriated for fiscal years 1992-1997.  The statement of policy outlines several important components:  &quot;to develop a National Intermodal Transportation System that is economically efficient, environmentally sound, provides the foundation for the Nation to compete in the global economy and will move people and goods in an energy efficient manner&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ITSEA&quot;&gt;United States. Department of Transportation. Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 - Summary. By Samuel K. Skinner. National Transportation Library. Web. 21 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://ntl.bts.gov/DOCS/ste.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the goals of ITSEA 1991 are:

* A National Highway System (NHS), consisting primarily of existing Interstate routes and a portion of the Primary System, is established to focus Federal resources on roads that are the most important to interstate travel and national defense, roads that connect with other modes of transportation, and are essential for international commerce.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITSEA&quot; /&gt;
* 
* State and local governments are given more flexibility in determining transportation solutions, whether transit or highways, and the tools of enhanced planning and management systems to guide them in making the best choices.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITSEA&quot; /&gt;
* 
* New technologies, such as intelligent vehicle highway systems and prototype magnetic levitation systems, are funded to push the Nation forward into thinking of new approaches in providing 21st Century transportation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITSEA&quot; /&gt;
* 
* The private sector is tapped as a source for funding transportation improvements.  Restrictions on the use of Federal funds for toll roads have been relaxed and private entities may even own such facilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITSEA&quot; /&gt;
* 
* Highway funds are available for activities that enhance the environment, such as wetland banking, mitigation of damage to wildlife habitat, historic sites, activities that contribute to meeting air quality standards, a wide range of bicycle and pedestrian projects, and highway beautification.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITSEA&quot; /&gt;


====Major Change in Transportation Planning, Policy, and Deployment====

The transit formula and discretionary programs requirements and program structure remained basically unchanged from previous law, but achieved such objectives as transit and highway funding flexibility and identical matching shares, rail modernization funding by formula, increased use of the trust fund, and an expanded research program.  However, a number of programs, including planning and research, began to be funded as percentage takedowns from the total amount of funding provided rather than as separate line items. Reflecting the broader mandates of the transit program, the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, who generally administered these provisions, was renamed the Federal Transit Administration (FTA).&lt;ref name=&quot;ITSEA&quot; /&gt;

====I-69 advocacy begins====
Long before the passing of ITSEA, residents of southwestern Indiana had been exploring the construction of an interstate between Indianapolis and Evansville in hopes of spurring economic development in the region &lt;ref name=&quot;M29&quot;&gt; I-69 Information.  Web.  21 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.ccswin.com/policy/I-69.asp&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  Throughout the mid-1980s, the Southwestern Indiana Highway Coalition (SWIRHC) advocated for a connection to be built and successfully lobbied for a feasibility study to be conducted in hopes of validating that proposition.  Unfortunately for the SWIRHC and its supporters in southwestern Indiana, the feasibility study concluded that a highway between the two cities would not be cost-effective &lt;ref name=&quot;M28&quot;&gt; I-69 Research.  Web.  19 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.indiana.edu/~bslib/i69guide.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  This report, commonly referred to as the &quot;Donohue Study&quot; was forwarded to the Federal Highway Administration and effectively shut out the possibility of an individual interstate being built solely for the purpose of connected the two cities &lt;ref name=&quot;M10&quot;&gt;Dellinger, Matt. Interstate 69. New York: Scribner, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;.

But the proponents of getting the two cities connected were not stifled by the Donahue study, instead they opted to get their connection built through a grander road building project, Interstate 69.  This pursuit of this project became a reality when an Indiana businessman named David Graham met with a researcher at the Hudson Institute named David Reed &lt;ref name=&quot;M30&quot;&gt;The Men Behind the Interstate. Web. 19 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://washtimesherald.com/local/x1703939795/The-men-behind-an-interstate&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  Together, these men drew up a broad proposal to extend interstate 69 from Michigan, through Indiana, and through four other states before terminating in Texas along the Mexico border &lt;ref name=&quot;M10&quot;&gt;Dellinger, Matt. Interstate 69. New York: Scribner, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;.  With this proposal in hand, David Graham set out to promote the vision and would go on to form the Mid-Continent Highway Coalition &lt;ref name=&quot;M10&quot;&gt;Dellinger, Matt. Interstate 69. New York: Scribner, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;.  

It is from here that one of the most controversial road proposals in the history of the United States began.

==Stakeholders==
===States===
====Michigan====

While many maps of the proposed Eisenhower Interstate System from the late 1950s and 1960s depict I-69 running as far north as I-94 at Marshall, the Michigan State Highway Department  had other plans in mind. The I-69 interchange with I-94 was constructed as a full cloverleaf-style interchange  with collector/distributor ramps that indicated future expansion. In 1968, the northern end of the actual freeway ended almost a mile north of I-94. Expansion would come in 1970 and 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bessert&quot;&gt;Bessert, Christopher J. Michigan Highways: Highways 60 through 69. 31 January 2009. 16 October 2011 &lt;http://www.michiganhighways.org/listings/MichHwys60-69.html#I-069&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:I69--Michigan-Indiana.png|thumb|Map of Interstate 69 from Michigan to Indianapolis, Indiana]]
With the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement in the early 1990s, many border points between Canada, the United States and Mexico became increasingly important points of international trade, with I-69 and I-94 being two Interstates leading directly from Canadian border crossings to major cities in the Midwest. Proponents of extending I-69 southeasterly into Texas use the &quot;NAFTA Highway&quot; concept in their defense of the extension, while opponents cite the lack of a need for such a highway and the environmental concerns. Today, I-69 begins in Michigan and ends in neighboring Indiana. The first 81 miles of I-69 in Michigan is signed as a north-south highway. At Mile 81, I-69 is signed as an east-west highway.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bessert&quot; /&gt;

====Indiana====

Since the 1940s the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) and its predecessor agencies considered an improved highway between Evansville and Indianapolis. Although the idea wasn’t fully developed the idea continued to receive attention until the early 1990s. Congress selected an Evansville to Indianapolis highway as part of a national high priority transportation corridor, designated as Corridor 18 in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (known as ISTEA). By the late 1990s, Congress further decided that Corridor 18 would be a part of a national Interstate highway project, I-69, which would improve connections between Canada, Mexico and the United States. &lt;ref name=&quot;INDOT&quot;&gt;&quot;Project Overview: i69indyevn.org&quot;. Indiana Department of Transportation. Web. 16 October 2011.&lt;http://www.i69indyevn.org/i-69-tier-2-overview/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress has addressed the location of Corridor 18 in several ways; by designating the corridor itself, by approving funding for a &quot;high-priority segment&quot; of the corridor, and by approving the National Highway System (NHS) map for Indiana. To determine the legal status of Corridor 18, it is necessary to consider all of these expressions of the intentions of Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;DEIS&quot;&gt;&quot;I-69 FAQ.&quot; Official I-69 Evansville to Indianapolis Study Homepage. Indiana Department of Transportation. Web. 16 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://deis.i69indyevn.org/faq.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 1105(f) of ISTEA authorized funding for certain &quot;high-priority segments&quot; of the high-priority corridors. One of the high-priority segments listed in this section was the &quot;Bloomington-to-Newberry&quot; section of Corridor 18. Subsequently, the description of this high-priority segment was extended to &quot;Bloomington to Evansville.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DEIS&quot; /&gt;

In ISTEA, Congress directed the States to recommend routes that should be included on the NHS, a national network of highways that serve as the primary focus for federal transportation investments. The map developed by INDOT, and approved by FHWA, included an Evansville-to-Bloomington-to-Indianapolis route. Congress approved the Indiana NHS map in 1995, and approved a slightly modified version in 1998. The current approved NHS map for Indiana shows an Evansville-to-Bloomington-to-Indianapolis highway, but does not specifically designate this route as Corridor 18 and does not depict this route as an Interstate. &lt;ref name=&quot;DEIS&quot; /&gt;

The FHWA and INDOT interpret the current legal status of Corridor 18 as follows:

Corridor 18 must connect Evansville and Indianapolis, but does not need to connect to Bloomington;
the funding authorized for the &quot;high-priority segment&quot; between Evansville and Bloomington can be used for construction of Corridor 18 only if an Evansville-to-Bloomington-to-Indianapolis route is chosen (or the legislation is changed); and
the current NHS map for Indiana does not specifically identify a location for Corridor 18.&lt;ref name=&quot;DEIS&quot; /&gt;

====Kentucky====

Gov. Steve Beshear announced federal approval of an agreement by which a 38-mile section of the Wendell H. Ford Western Kentucky Parkway will be designated Interstate 69 by Fall 2011. It is the first segment of what will become an I-69 corridor from Henderson to Fulton, incorporating the Julian Carroll/Purchase Parkway, Edward T. Breathitt Pennyrile Parkway and a portion of I-24 in addition to the Ford/Western Kentucky Parkway. The agreement, which Federal Highway Administrator Victor Mendez approved on Aug. 25, 2011 covers the Ford/Western Kentucky Parkway from its interchange with I-24 near Eddyville to its interchange with the Breathitt/Pennyrile Parkway near Nortonville, in Hopkins County. The agreement outlines improvements the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet will undertake to bring sections of the parkway up to interstate standards. It also identifies design features that are less than interstate standards but which the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has determined acceptable.&lt;ref name=&quot;KY&quot;&gt;Todd, Keith. &quot;Kentucky I-69 Agreement Approved.&quot; WKMS. WKMS.com, 31 Aug. 2011. Web. 16 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wkms/news.newsmain/article/0/5666/1847209/Regional.Headlines/Kentucky.I-69.Agreement.Approved&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the agreed improvements have been advertised to construction contractors, the designated section of the Ford/Western Kentucky Parkway will be eligible for the distinctive red, white and blue shield signs that identify interstate routes. In addition, about 17 miles of I-24, from Eddyville to the Carroll/Purchase Parkway interchange, will also bear I-69 signs, making the total, initial I-69 designation 55 miles long. &lt;ref name=&quot;KY&quot; /&gt;

====Tennessee====

Approximately four miles of I-69 will be built in and around Union City and Troy; this area is represented by federal site maps as &quot;Sections of Independent Utility - 7&quot; or SIU-7. The super-highway will incept north of Union City on U.S. Highway 21 and will run north to Kentucky and southwest, behind Goodyear and Hampton Inn. It will also continue running east of Troy, intersecting U.S. Highway 5. The interstate will then merge into existing U.S Highway 51, which will be upgraded and converted to I-69, between Troy and Dyersburg.&lt;ref name=&quot;TN&quot;&gt;&quot;Dyersburg State Gazette: Local News: Northwest Tennessee Construction of I-69 Continues This Summer (04/09/09).&quot; Dyersburg State Gazette. Dyersburg State Gazette, 09 Apr. 2009. Web. 16 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.stategazette.com/story/1529259.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The project continues from Millington to Dyersburg, Tennessee in Shelby, Tipton, Lauderdale, and Dyer Counties. The proposed project represented on federal site maps as SIU-8 begins at State Route 385 (Paul Barrett Parkway) in Shelby County and extends north to the I-155/US-412/US-51 interchange in Dyer County.  The project has two main alternative corridors.  Corridor R (Red) extends from the State Route 385 (Paul Barrett Parkway) to the west of Millington, Covington, Ripley and Dyersburg  and west of US 51 (SR 3) to I-155 in Dyersburg.  Corridor G (Green) extends to the east of US 51 (SR 3) from State Route 385 (Paul Barrett Parkway) to the I-155/US-412/US-51 interchange in Dyersburg.  Variations of these corridors with crossovers are being studied. 
The proposed project will be built to interstate design standards and will consist of a four-lane divided, access controlled facility with interchanges at major crossroads.  This proposed project is approximately 65 miles in length.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Interstate 69 Project.&quot; PROJECT DATA SUMMARY SHEET: INTERSTATE 69, Section 8. Tennessee Department of Transportation.

The final section of the proposed I-69 route, SUI-9, runs from Hernando, Mississippi to Millington, Tennessee passing through Desoto and Marshall Counties in Mississippi and Shelby and Fayette Counties in Tennessee.  The Tennessee Department of Transportation is continuing its public involvement process for the Shelby County I-69/I-269 project area.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Interstate 69 Project.&quot; PROJECT DATA SUMMARY SHEET: INTERSTATE 69, Section 9.

====Mississippi====

In Shelby County, I-269, a western, semi-circular subsection of I-69, encompasses former U.S. Highway 385. The future I-269 subsection on the corridor is almost completed between Millington and Collierville. It is expected to be fully constructed by 2013.  The I-69 corridor will run west of U.S. Highway 51 and will be broken into three sections. It will then join Interstate 240, also a Future I-69 Corridor, and will run directly through Memphis, merging into Interstate-55 at Hernando, Miss. The route then runs east to Tunica, Miss. This particular section of I-69, running from Hernando to Tunica, is complete.  Efforts are currently under way to acquire rights of way on I-240. I-69 construction lettings on I-240 are to begin later this year.  A groundbreaking ceremony was held on June 23, 2011 in celebration of beginning construction on one of its five I-269 subsection SIUs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cherry&quot;&gt;Cherry, Bessie. &quot;Local Portion of I-69 Expected to Be Complete in Summer 2012.&quot; nwtntoday.com.

====Louisiana====

The Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD), in cooperation with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), is conducting an environmental and location study to construct a section of the I–69, known nationally as SIU 15. The project would provide a divided, four-lane, limited access highway on new location between US Highway 171 (US 171) near the Town of Stonewall in DeSoto Parish, and Interstate Highway 20 (I–20) near the Town of Haughton in Bossier Parish, a distance of approximately 35 miles. The project Study Area encompasses portions of Bossier, Caddo, and DeSoto Parishes.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;DOTD I-69, SIU 15 Project Site - Why A New Highway?&quot; DOTD I-69, SIU 15 Project Site - Home Page.

====Texas====

The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) plans routes of the interstate in five segments with the help of committees composed of local officials and stakeholders.  I-69 is planned to occupy the footprint of existing highways, including U.S. highways 59, 77, 84 and 281, and State Highway 44.&lt;ref&gt;Villarreal, Michelle. &quot;Transportation Officials to Meet Wednesday in Kingsville to Discuss I-69 Development » Corpus Christi Caller-Times.&quot; Caller.com.

Web. 16 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.caller.com/news/2011/sep/20/transportation-officials-to-meet-wednesday-in-to/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  TxDOT has not determined specific locations for the Texas Corridor, but the proposed routes would generally parallel interstate routes. As currently envisioned, each corridor will include as many as six lanes for passenger vehicles and up to four lanes for large trucks. Corridors also will have up to six rail lines for high-speed passenger rail between cities, high-speed freight, and conventional commuter and freight transit.  Another unique component of each route will be a 61-meter (200-foot)-wide dedicated utility zone for water, oil, and gas pipelines, and transmission lines for electricity, broadband, and other telecommunications services.&lt;ref&gt;Palacios, Antonio. &quot;Trans-Texas Corridor - Vol. 69 No. 1 - Public Roads.&quot; Federal Highway Administration. Federal Highway Administration, July-Aug. 2005. Web. 16 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/05jul/07.cfm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advocacy Groups===
The proposed building of an interstate that if completed, would span 1,700 miles across seven states, is bound to draw the interest of both supporters and opponents.  The authors of this case study will address the prominent members of both sides in hopes of painting the representative ideals of each movement.

====Groups in Support of I-69====
Although initially started as an Indiana movement to build an interstate from Evansville to Bloomington, I-69's supporters now span an eight state region &lt;ref name=&quot;M25&quot;&gt; History of the I-69 Boondoggle.  Web.  20 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.i69tour.org/boondoggle.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  In each state, the politically and monetarily invested champion the development of I-69 with varying degrees of success.  In battleground states such as Texas and Indiana, the proverbial wars between groups in favor and those in opposition of I-69 routinely make the news.  In states like Kentucky, the opposition movement is less prevalent and support is widely accepted.  Despite these differences, supporters in each state tout economic development and safety as the two principal reasons to build I-69.  

=====Mid-Continent Highway Coalition=====
The Mid-Continent Highway Coalition is comprised of a group of politicians, businessman, and community leaders from seven states, that have lobbied for the completion of the I-69 corridor project &lt;ref name=&quot;M10&quot;&gt;Dellinger, Matt. Interstate 69. New York: Scribner, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Started in 1993, the Coalition been successful at drumming up support and garnering funding needed to complete I-69.  The Mid-Continent Highway Coalition is the most storied and powerful of all the pro I-69 groups.  Initially the Coalition's efforts towards earning support was modest.  The group's efforts consisted primarily of newsletter distribution and an annual trip by two of its members to Washington D.C..  After nominal success by these means, the Coalition decided it needed to increase its efforts by hiring lobbyists to campaign on behalf of them.  Starting in 1995, the vast majority of the Mid-Continent Highway Coalition's annual budget went to paying for the annual salary of its two lobbyists &lt;ref name=&quot;M25&quot;&gt; History of the I-69 Boondoggle.  Web.  20 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.i69tour.org/boondoggle.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.   The use of well paid lobbyists differs greatly from the internet-based efforts of opposition groups.  Although the group has suffered some partnership drawbacks, particular with the state of Texas, the group has been the prominent voice in support of the completion of I-69.

=====Alliance for I-69 Texas=====
The Alliance for I-69 Texas formed in 1994 and is comprised of cities, counties, port authorities and community leaders that support the I-69 corridor project in Texas &lt;ref name=&quot;M24&quot;&gt;Alliance for I-69 Texas.  Web.  20 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.i69texasalliance.com/alliance.html&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt;.  The coalition strongly promotes the conversion of existing Highways 59, 77, 84 and 281, and State Highway 44 to interstate quality.  This incremental approach to upgrading to interstate standards is unique for the Texas delegation &lt;ref name=&quot;M10&quot;&gt;Dellinger, Matt. Interstate 69. New York: Scribner, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The Alliance firmly  believes that this conversion will make travel for Texans safer and that they will reap economic benefits from this heavy investment.  This investment is projected to cost billions of dollars and the means to provide funding for it have caused rifts throughout Texas.  Governor Perry's Trans-Texas Corridor project sought to ease the funding constraints of road building in Texas through the use of public private partnerships.  Some members of the Alliance embraced this concept and voiced their support of the Trans-Texas Corridor project.  However, many felt that the support for another highway project strayed from the Alliance's primary focus and as a result, withdrew from the coalition &lt;ref name=&quot;M25&quot;&gt;County quits Alliance for I-69.  Web.  20 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/County-quits-Alliance-for-I-69-1641332.php&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt;.  Despite these setbacks, the Alliance for I-69 Texas maintains:  

* The I-69 corridor promotes economic development, new jobs and more efficient freight movements between cities and rural towns.
* Converting the current highways to interstate standards will provide safer travel for Texans throughout the corridor.
* Recognizes the funding constraints of the I-69 proposal and encourages innovative financing tools to step up the pace of developing incremental projects.

====Groups Against the Construction of I-69====
For over two decades, the I-69 corridor proposal has created a substantial opposition force that consists of everyone from farmers to environmentalists.  These groups initially operated independently from one another but with the utilization of the internet, the movement expanded throughout the nation.  In states that were directly affected by the project, opposition varied.  In states like Kentucky and Mississippi, opposition to the proposal was marginal when compared to the states of Indiana and Texas.  

Opposition groups utilized a wide range of techniques to promote their beliefs.  Grassroots organizations like CARR and Count US!, used education, research, and letter writing as a means to influence change.  Other groups, such as Roadblock Earth First! utilized more unconventional means to get their message across.  Although united in opposition, the unconventional tactics of Roadblock Earth First! drew criticism from CARR and Count US!.  

It is important to note that attempting to summarize the wide dispersal of opposition groups throughout the I-69 corridor is a monumental task.  The authors of this case study chose the following opposition groups in hopes of generalizing the common ideologies that characterize the movement.

=====Citizens for Appropriate Rural Roads=====
The Citizens for Appropriate Rural Roads (CARR) was founded by Thomas and Sandra Tokarski of Standford, Indiana&lt;ref name=&quot;M9&quot;&gt;&quot;CARR, Citizens for Appropriate Rural Roads.&quot; . Web. 11 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.carri69.org/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.  CARR was the first organized group that universally opposed the construction of the I-69 corridor.  The Tokarskis founded the group in the fall of 1990 after learning the proposed interstate project would be built directly through their property despite a federally funded study opposing the future development of the interstate corridor.  CARR started small in advocacy, reserving a fire station hall and bringing the I-69 proposal to light for the citizens of Standford.  From there, the opposition to I-69 continued to grow at a localized level.  Although CARR's opposition to the I-69 proposal was notable on a local scale, as it matured, supporters from across the nation began aiding in the group's cause.  In 1995, with the help of an environmental lawyer, CARR successfully proved that the environmental studies conducted by the Indianan Department of Transportation (INDOT) for the I-69 proposal were flawed and violated provisions outlined by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)&lt;ref name=&quot;M10&quot;&gt;Dellinger, Matt. Interstate 69. New York: Scribner, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; .  This victory in court meant that for I-69 to move forward, INDOT would have to adhere to the provisions outlined by NEPA, which included fully assessing alternatives to the building of the interstate&lt;ref name=&quot;M10&quot;&gt;Dellinger, Matt. Interstate 69. New York: Scribner, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; .  CARR's success at delaying the building of I-69 caught national attention and the group garnered support from a wide swath of citizens ranging from environmentalists to fiscal conservatives.  The group rejects I-69 for the following reasons&lt;ref name=&quot;M9&quot;&gt;&quot;CARR, Citizens for Appropriate Rural Roads.&quot; . Web. 11 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.carri69.org/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;:

*Environmental impacts on the area's water wells, wetlands, wild-life, and limestone karst landscape.
*Believes I-69 is not appropriately funded and that the fiscal benefits that are associated with the project are grossly over-estimated.
*Advocates maintaining the current infrastructure of roads that adequately serve the region.

=====Count US!=====
Count US! is an acronym for Counties Under New Terrain US I-69.  Count US! was founded by John Smith, who formed the group after learning his house would be lost if the corridor proposals for I-69 came to fruition&lt;ref name=&quot;M10&quot;&gt;Dellinger, Matt. Interstate 69. New York: Scribner, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Count US! worked in unison with CARR to oppose the building of I-69 through southwestern Indiana.  The group maintained that the specific interstate route proposals from INDOT were intentionally vague and posed a  significant threat to homeowners in the proposed corridor area&lt;ref name=&quot;M12&quot;&gt;&quot;CAR Car Rally Tour&quot;.  Web.  12 Oct. 2011.  &lt;http://www.i69tour.org/oldindex.html/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Through its newsletters and website, the group maintained the following&lt;ref name=&quot;M13&quot;&gt;COUNT US! Counties Under New Terrain US I-69&quot;.  Web.  16 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.i69tour.org/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;:

*The Environmental Impact Studies conducted for the I-69 route selection were misleading.
*Simply upgrading IN-41 / I-70 would save money, the environment, and free up funds for maintaining the current road infrastructure.
*Governor Daniel's plan to allow the privatization/tolling of I-69 puts taxpayers at the mercy of private for-profit organizations.

=====Corridor Watch=====
Corridor Watch was established in 2004 as a direct response to the Trans Texas Corridor Project.  Corridor Watch's founding members, Linda and David Stall, became active after learning that House Bill 3588 had passed through the Texas State Legislature&lt;ref name=&quot;M10&quot;&gt;Dellinger, Matt. Interstate 69. New York: Scribner, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; ..  According to the Stalls, advocacy for opposition to HB 3588 was needed because the bill authorized the use of privatized tolling as a means to fund future highway projects, to include I-69.  Using the Toronto's 407 as a reference point, the Stalls stated that greed for increased profit margins would negate any benefits gleaned from this privatized funding structure.  Corridor Watch is against&lt;ref name=&quot;M23&quot;&gt;&quot;CorridorWatch.org-Challenging the Wisdom of the Trans Texas Corridor Project.&quot; Web. 11 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.corridorwatch.org/ttc_2007/CW00000035.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;:

*Private control of public infrastructure, whether direct or indirect.
*The use of transportation and transportation related projects as general revenue generators.
*Conversion of existing free highways into toll ways.

=====Roadblock Earth First!=====
Roadblock Earth First! is an offshoot of the anarchist, environmentalist group, &quot;Earth First!&quot;.  Earth First! (EF!) was founded in 1979 as an environmentalist movement that rejects the human-centric, industrialized world through the use of unconventional protest&lt;ref name=&quot;M22&quot;&gt;&quot;Earth First! No Compromise in Defense of Mother Earth&quot;.  Web.  12 Oct. 2011.  &lt;http://www.earthfirstjournal.org/section.php?id=1/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.  EF! rejects the concept of a professional organization with a structured hierarchy.  The group simply advocates action in defense of Mother Earth.  Unlike other opposition groups, Roadblock EF!'s founder and members are shrouded in secrecy.  The group is notoriously secretive and embraces anonymity as a key strength in the organization.  Since 2005, Roadblock EF! has vandalized and intimidated a number of organizations associated with the construction of I-69.  In fact, the group maintains an online journal, cataloging their exploits&lt;ref name=&quot;M21&quot;&gt;&quot;Stop I-69&quot;.  Web.  12 Oct. 2011.  &lt;http://stopi69.wordpress.com/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Although no specific leadership is identified, Roadblock EF! maintains that I-69 is a highway is being built on the foundation of globalized corporate greed.  The group believes that:

*I-69 is a NAFTA super highway, that will be utilized to move businesses south to exploit cheap labor in Mexico.
*Majority of route will displace families, destroy archeological sites, and destroy the environment through the building of &quot;new terrain&quot;.
*Direct action in the form of civil disobedience, vandalism, and other unconventional tactics are the best means to stop the building of I-69.

==Future Developments==
&lt;br /&gt;
The future of the I-69 corridor is currently uncertain. With local and state governments scrabbling to salvage their budgets and a strong drive in Washington to trim the size of the federal government, funding for the corridor is uncertain at best. The absence of a long-term federal surface transportation bill puts the brakes on construction and has left the local partners in a game of wait-and-see.
A planning commission representative from Tennessee says “recent and expected upcoming budget cuts in funding for I-69 most certainly pose possible construction delays for developing throughout northwest Tennessee.” The Federal Transportation Funding Bill is expected to cut funding by about 35 percent, which will cut the Tennessee Department of Transportation’s funding for the project by about $281 million. U.S. senators for Tennessee, Bob Corker and Lamar Alexander, both say the federal government is doing as much as it can to fund project efforts. In order to secure more stable funding for the project they have proposed the states involved in the corridor should levy a gasoline tax.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cherry&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

	A different strategy has been used by Indiana to fund their portions. Indiana has used, and is continuing to use, proceeds from a commercial highway toll booth in order to fund its portion of I-69 construction. By 2014, Indiana will only have approximately 50 remaining miles left to build from Bloomington to Indianapolis. Despite a better funding situation, local opposition to the corridor is threatening to halt the project. &lt;br /&gt;

	The Bloomington Metropolitan Planning Organization has removed the two mile stretch of I-69 from their long-range comprehensive plans. A federal delegation of congressional representatives from the state have petitioned the planning commission chair stating that the organization holds “legitimate concerns about the project”  but that they should be worked out with INDot and the Federal Highway Administration.&lt;ref&gt;Gabrick, Jason. “Federal Transportation Dollars at Risk with I-69.” Indiana Public Media. 11 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomington removed I-69 from their plans due to significant local opposition from community members. Local opposition could lead to a loss all federal transportation dollars slated for the portion of the corridor.&lt;br /&gt;

	Kentucky has hired a lobbyist in coordination with Indiana to leverage federal funding for a bridge across the Ohio River in order to link the state’s sections of the I-69 corridor. Instead of acquiring new right of way for I-69, Kentucky plans to reconstruct its existing western U.S. Highways at Pennyrile Parkway and Purchase Parkway. Despite this cost saving measure, the retrofitting is still estimated to cost over a billion dollars.&lt;br /&gt;

	Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas have not made significant progress in completing their local portions of the corridor. In Mississippi, environmental impact studies have been completed for four of their five sections of roadway but local funding is not available to start construction. Arkansas has started minor construction only in very small areas. The state has hired a consultant to investigate “innovative financing” options for the state’s portion. Louisiana has yet to identify where it plans to site its section of the corridor. Texas has made no progress on the project except for putting signs along U.S. highway 59 to notify locals that it is part of the future corridor.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Sean. “The Road to I-69.” Bossier Press – Tribune. 30 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In general, use the acquired wisdom of others in doing any experiment, especially that of a teacher or whoever else is in charge. Make sure that before you do an experiment that you have read about it beforehand and  know what you are doing. You are almost certainly not the first person to do an experiment, and someone already knows what is safe and what isn't. Always follow instructions, and neither do unplanned experiments nor modify the one planned -- even in doing the experiment on a larger scale. Recognize that fire, radioactive substances, hot or very cold objects, and all chemicals are potentially dangerous. Keep all equipment clean, and beware of broken glass that can be contaminated. Dispose of all hazardous substances properly.    

You are the person most responsible for your safety. You can usually do far more to protect yourself from a bad incident than someone else can do to rescue you from a bad event. Report any known hazard that arises to the teacher or other person responsible for the laboratory.

== Introduction ==
The '''Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon''', commonly known as the '''[[Remembering the Templars/Templars|Knights Templar]]''', the '''Order of the Temple''' or simply as '''Templars''', were among the most famous of the [[Biblical Studies/Christianity/Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic Church]] [[Remembering_the_Templars#Military_orders|military order]]s. Founded during the [[Remembering the Templars/Age|High Middle Ages]] after the [[w:First Crusade|First Crusade]] to help protect Christian pilgrims, the organization lasted for nearly two centuries.

Officially endorsed by Roman Catholic Church around 1129, the Order became a favored charity throughout Christendom, and grew rapidly in membership and power. Templar knights, in their distinctive white [[w:Mantle (vesture)|mantles]] with a red [[w:Christian cross|cross]], were among the most skilled fighting units of the [[w:Crusades|Crusades]]. Non-combatant members of the Order managed a large economic infrastructure throughout [[w:Christendom|Christendom]], innovating financial techniques that were an early form of [[w:banking|banking]], and building [[w:fortification|fortification]]s across Europe and the [[w:Holy Land|Holy Land]].

The Templars' existence was tied closely to the Crusades; when the Holy Land was lost, support for the Order faded. Rumors about the Templars' secret initiation ceremony created mistrust, and King [[w:Philip IV of France|Philip IV of France]] (Philippe le Bel), deeply in debt to the Order, took advantage of the situation. In 1307, many of the Order's members in France were charges of heresy, arrested, tortured into giving [[w:false confession|false confession]]s, and then [[w:death by burning|burned at the stake]]. Under pressure from King Philip, [[w:Pope Clement V|Pope Clement V]] disbanded the Order in 1312. The abrupt disappearance of a major part of the European infrastructure gave rise to speculation and legends, which have kept the &quot;Templar&quot; name alive into the modern day. Only recently did we learn that in [[w:1314|1314]] the Order had secretly been pardoned by [[w:Pope Clement V|Pope Clement V]].

== The Crusades and the Reconquista ==
[[w:Crusades|The Crusades]] was one of the most important events of the period, consisting in a series of religious Crusades, in which [[w:Christian|Christian]]s fought to retake Palestine from the [[w:Seljuk Turks|Seljuk Turks]]. The Crusades impacted all levels of society in the High Middle Ages, from the kings and emperors who themselves led the Crusades, to the lowest peasants whose lords were often absent in the east. The height of the Crusades was the 12th century, following the First Crusade and the foundation of the [[w:Crusader state|Crusader state]]s; in the 13th century and beyond, Crusades were also directed against fellow Christians, and in eastern and northern Europe, non-Muslim pagans. Expanded contact with the east, especially among the city-states of Italy, would eventually help spark the Italian [[w:Renaissance|Renaissance]], that then spread throughout the whole of western [[w:Christendom|Christendom]]. The [[History of Western Theatre: 17th_Century to Now/Late German 18th#.22Nathan the Wise.22|late German 18th century theater play &quot;Nathan the Wise&quot; that unfolds in the 12th century Jerusalem]] can be interesting to better contextualize the epoch.

=== Freemasonry ===
Since at least the 18th century [[w:Freemasonry|Freemasonry]] has incorporated Templar symbols and rituals in a number of [[w:Masonic bodies|Masonic bodies]], most notably, the &quot;[[w:Knights Templar (Freemasonry)#The Degree of Knight of the Temple (Order of the Temple)|Order of the Temple]]&quot; the final order joined in &quot;The United Religious, Military and Masonic Orders of the Temple and of St John of Jerusalem, Palestine, Rhodes and Malta&quot; commonly known as the Knights Templar. One theory of the origins of Freemasonry claims direct descent from the historical Knights Templar through its final fourteenth-century members who took refuge in [[w:Scotland|Scotland]], or other countries where the Templar suppression was not enforced. This theory is usually deprecated on grounds of lack of evidence, by both Masonic authorities (See [http://www.knightstemplar.org/faq1.html#origin Knights Templar FAQ]) and historians (See [http://web.archive.org/web/20101215153015/http://freemasonrytoday.com/19/p07.php Freemasonry Today periodical (Issue January 2002) publisher Grand Lodge Publications Ltd]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">This idiom requires serious rework! Three *distinct* patterns are incorrectly mixed together:
1. non-virtual interface
2. template method pattern
3. before/after invariant checking

1 is a statement about not having virtual functions in the *public* part of an interface and *nothing* more. Reason: distinguish between two major audiences of the inerface, implementers and end-users!
2 is a way to inject specific code into a base class by deriving from it and implement virtual functions and *nothing* more.
3 doesn't have anything to do with 1 and 2.

Just because all three can be used together doesn't mean they are the same.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It's pointless to have a member function
virtual Employee::Employee* create()
What the author probably wanted to do is polymorphic construction, aka factory pattern. In this case a non-member function gets some type flag and returns a newly created object typed as pointer to base.

Consequently the name &quot;virtual constructor&quot; is wrong, which is commonly understood as the factory pattern! Please rename this idiom here to &quot;clone&quot; instead and remove virtual member &quot;create&quot; from the example.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">pH is the value which allows people to understand a solution is a base, acid, or neutral. If a solution has pH which is bigger than 7,it is a base. If a solution has pH which is smaller than 7, it is an acid. If a solution has pH which is equal to 7, it is a neutral solution. That solution is water. Understand a solution in a living organism can help to understand the metabolism happens in that living organism.

Hello, thank you for your recent edits to pages on Wikibooks.

Please see the link above for tips about editing Wikibooks.  When you edit article please remember to ''not'' sign your edits.  This isn't necessary except on Talk pages.  Also please try to add information into the correct parts of the page, rather than putting everything at the very start of the page.

== Please do not add your signature to pages that you edit ==

Please do not sign your edits to book pages (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;).  This is ''only'' necessary when you edit Talk pages, vote for or against the deletion of articles and never within a page of the book.  There is always a record of the edits you have made to a page if you click on the ''View History'' tab near the top of the screen so signatures are not necessary.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:04, 19 October 2011 (UTC)

== Please stop ==

We welcome and appreciate [[Special:Contributions/Mttrang1|your contributions]], but some of your recent edits had to be undone. Please see [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks|What is Wikibooks?]] to learn more about what contributions are beneficial to Wikibooks.

Please consider this to be your final warning.

{{tmbox|type=notice|text='''Please do not delete all the content from pages.'''&lt;br /&gt;Page blanking may be mistaken for [[WB:DWV|vandalism]] and does not delete the page. If you wish to have this page deleted please instead add {{tlx|delete|your reason}} to the top of the page and preserve the previous contents, or if it is a duplicate page, add {{tlx|previous edit history|other page name}} to the page instead, so that an administrator can fix it. Please read the [[WB:DP|deletion policy]] to learn more about when pages should be deleted and alternatives to deletion. Thank you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Very nicely done.  The layout of your wikibook is nice, clear and easy to read.  I like the examples that you provided throughout the page. (C Lloyd)

Thanks, C. It's still not quite done, I have a few finishing touches to do. I just figured out how to do the references last night, so I will add the rest of them soon.

== picture ==

I am not sure how everyone is modifying their picture and putting infromation in the box - I had mucho trouble with this wiki but I'm still learning. I have added several of the sites that you used that I am not familiar with so thank you! SL[[User:Sleclerc|Sleclerc]] ([[User talk:Sleclerc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sleclerc|contribs]]) 19:01, 18 October 2011 (UTC)

Check out the Images and Wikipedia section in the Image Content page -- it should help you get started. 

Once you have placed the code for the image in a wiki page, you can add the words for the caption.

== Pretty much done, for now ==

I did add what I had planned to add and made sure the references were there. Hey, it's a wiki page so I might come back and change things later, or maybe someone else will!--[[User:Rcamuse|Rcamuse]] ([[User talk:Rcamuse|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rcamuse|contribs]]) 15:36, 19 October 2011 (UTC)

Ruth, did you add Everystockphoto.com? That's a pretty strong collection of images that incorporates CC images from Flikr, Morguefile, Xchange, and others. 

In terms of writing style, think of an encyclopedia article. Some of your narrative may be too informal, for example using &quot;you&quot; as though you are talking to the reader. [[User:Sgarrigan|Sgarrigan]] ([[User talk:Sgarrigan|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sgarrigan|contribs]]) 04:06, 21 October 2011 (UTC)

S.G., I did include everystockphoto.com in the Creative Commons section of the page. Actually that site could be listed under public domain, commercial, and provider supplied licenses too, because it searches through all of them. It's really a great site.

When I chose the style for this page, I was thinking of it more as a lesson than an encyclopedic entry. I'll come back to this later and see what I can do to make it a bit more formal. There's a book that was featured today in Wikibooks that uses informal language, including &quot;you&quot; --  [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Lucid_Dreaming]]. I can see, though, it might be good to be consistent in the level of formality, matching language used in other pages in the Wikibook, in this case, ''User-Generated Content in Education''. --[[User:Rcamuse|Rcamuse]] ([[User talk:Rcamuse|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rcamuse|contribs]]) 22:13, 21 October 2011 (UTC)</text>

:The wiki was reconfigured to grant that to reviewers.  There is no longer a group called rollbackers.

== Converting .tiff to wiki text ==

Hi QU:

I am SarahPats. I uploaded a book licensed under the Creative Commons as a .tiff onto the Wiki Commons. You answered a question for me about translating this image into wiki text and said that you had converted the images into PDFs and that they still needed to be uploaded. I am assuming that you are a busy person and this is a side project for you so I was wondering if there was any way that you could maybe send m,e these PDF files so that i could upload them? I am not quite sure of what the process is for that but I would like to see this books go up on Wikibooks sometime soon so that i can see if I can upload more similar ones. Let me know what i can do!

== Mathematics ==

A short while back contributors refactored the books' categories under mathematics so that [[Subject:Mathematics]] uses {{tl|root subject}} now instead of {{tl|subject page}}.  This means that any books placed in [[:Category:Mathematics]] won't show up for readers.  They have to be filed in a subcategory from now on.  Just wanted to point it out.  Eventually the goal would be to have all the top-level subjects like that, to place an emphasis on featured books and the subcategories without individual books distracting and without tempting new contributors to just throw their books in the top-level for top placement. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:33, 7 February 2011 (UTC)

== Keep redirection from ml to Milliliters ==

You deleted the redirection from Cookbook:Ml to Cookbook:Millilitre because there already is a redirect from Cookbook:ML. I think this is insufficient. According to [[en:Litre]] millilitre is properly abbreviated as either ml or mL, NOT Ml or ML. In listing ingredients it is much more convenient (and correct) to write e.g. 200 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Cookbook:ml|]] than 200 [[Cookbook:ML|ml]] &lt;/nowiki&gt; . Besides, someone might try to look for the page on the measurement itself as ml. Because of wiki's capitalisation ml ends up as Ml. But I think it is no bigge to have 1 more redirect to the Millilitre page. It seems to be reasonable that on a wiki Cookbook the capitalisations of the pair of letters ml,Ml,mL,ML all lead to the Millilitre page. This should apply for other units too, as it just makes life simpler.

== Cultural Anthropology Textbook ==

Hi QU
You made some changes to the Cultural Anthropology book that I think should be undone. Large images are typical in Anth texts because they allow the reader to appreciate the detail that people go to to create meaning, in the case of the brides hands, The henna detail contributes to the readers understanding of the care of application of the henna as well as the potentially unfamiliar details, texture of the cloth of the dress etc. I am probably the one who made the images large , specifically for the purpose of making the text more comparable to commercially available texts and because there are some high quality images available in wikimedia commons. 

The other revision that I do not agree with is the links to wikipedia. I understand that for the most part in wikibooks the preference is to make the content stand alone with fewer links to wikipedia. However in the case of an introductory textbook the links to wikipedia function as a glossary for the introductory text so as student encounter a new term they can with a single click find the definition and encyclopedic content to explain the concept. This is a valuable learning tool that IMO should remain in the text. 

You also revised a lot of the grammar etc. This is much appreciated. However this makes me hesitant to just roll back the changes you made... any suggestions. --[[User:Paul James|Paul James]] ([[User talk:Paul James|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Paul James|contribs]]) 23:51, 7 April 2011 (UTC)

:I don't think I agree re. the WP links. A lot of WP is highly complex and isn't really useful as a glossary. Why wouldn't you create a separate glossary in the book itself, with simple one / two line descriptions of the terms? I've seen this done before - the term is highlighted in some way (e.g., in bold text), informing the reader that they can find the detail in the glossary. It could probably be wikilinked actually. I've got an example I'm working on so will see if it works. On the images, you can do what you want, I'm not that fussy to be honest, they just seemed enormous! &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 08:58, 8 April 2011 (UTC)

::So, the way I built the Glossary in &quot;my&quot; book can be seen here. Go to [[Castles of England/Norman Castles#Motte and Bailey Castles]], and look for the glossary link on &quot;'''Great Towers'''&quot;. If you click that it will link to [[Castles of England/English Castle Glossary]], i.e., within the same book, and shift the focus to the &quot;Great Tower&quot; entry in the glossary. If you think that kind of thing would work for the Cultural Anthropology book I'm happy to work on building the glossary and links. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 10:27, 8 April 2011 (UTC)

:I see what you have done with Castles Glossary [[Castles_of_England/English_Castle_Glossary#Great_tower]]. I think this would be great to have a glossary in the anthro textbook, especially if the terms linking to the glossary were somehow set apart with bold case or something. Then in the glossary maybe I can move the link to wikipedia for more info. It would also be cool to link back from the glossary to where they are used in the text (this would allow one glossary for the whole textbook rather than one for each chapter). Cool idea, Thanks!

Unfortunately I will not be able to stay online. But all told maybe it will be good to have a Help template.
My basic problem is that the blacklist prevents a reflist on the Earthquake page and I thought a template for help would work. I can see that I had already imported the Help template.

Hello. I want to request my user account be renamed from &quot;Slipknot1&quot; to &quot;'''A7x'''&quot; please. The reason is to maintain username consistency with [[meta:User:A7x|my other accounts]] in other Wikimedia projects. —[[Special:Emailuser/Slipknot1|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen&quot;&gt;§&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User:Slipknot1|&lt;span style=&quot;color:purple&quot;&gt;stay&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;big&gt;([[User talk:Slipknot1|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;'''sic'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/big&gt;! 07:54, 10 August 2011 (UTC)

== Help regarding unified login ==

I've been pondering about this many times before, but I'm not sure what to do. Since you're the one who've previously renamed me on this project, maybe I'll ask you. On most Wikimedia projects, I go under the pseudonym &quot;'''A7x'''&quot;. However I've been wanting to unify my account for a long time, but I've several issues that prevent me from merging my account. At Meta, I maintain an interwiki-matrix ([[meta:User:A7x/Matrix|click here]]) which lists all accounts that I've created and belong to me. When I looked up the [[tools:~vvv/sulutil.php|SUL collision detector]], someone else (idk who?) has created user accounts that have the exact same name, but they have very few edits, and some are on different languages that I don't understand.

The ones that specifically do '''not''' belong to me are the ones on English, German, and Russian Wikipedias. On the English Wikipedia, my account is named &quot;[[:wikipedia:en:User:TerrenceandPhillip|TerrenceandPhillip]]&quot;, and I have over 2500 edits on that project as well as additional rights. But there is another &quot;A7x&quot; account there, not created by me, which has zero counted edits. I've read about something called usurpation, but I don't know how that works. Also on the German Wikipedia, my account is named &quot;[[:wikipedia:de:Benutzer:Snake311|Snake311]]&quot;, and there is a different &quot;A7x&quot; there too, which has only one counted edit. Unfortunately, I don't read or understand German and Russian languages, so I wouldn't know how to navigate through the pages or talk with the local bureaucrats. By the way, I do not own any user account in the Russian Wikipedia, all I need is to get it out of the way. Unfortunately since you're not a steward, you probably can't help me outside this project, but I needed some help on how to start merging my accounts into a unified login. If you or Adrignola want to reply to me, you could do it here as I'll be watching this page, or on my [[meta:User talk:A7x|Meta talk page]].

== Quantitative Analysis ==

The following analysis seeks to analyze the life cycle of alternative energy source bus technology, as defined by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA).
The APTA does not collect their data by individual vehicle type from its member organizations, but rather categorizes the vehicles (specifically buses) by the number of energy sources used to provide driving power. In the case of Hybrid-Electric buses (HEB), the data is grouped together with other vehicles that use two or more different energy sources, which includes compressed natural gas buses (CNG) and electric buses, although HEBs are generally regarded as a more feasible option for the future. In addition to the nature of the categorization done by APTA, the organization is also only able to collect the specific (alternative or conventional diesel) vehicle data from their member organizations who opt to participate in APTA’s annual vehicle survey; the 2010 vehicle survey includes responses from 338 transit agencies within the United States. Furthermore, the data collected in the vehicle survey is used to estimate a total market share of alternative and conventional buses in the U.S. Finally, the estimated market share is multiplied against the actual total number of vehicles available for maximum use in the U.S. (APTA data) to calculate the estimated number of alternative energy source (heavy-duty) buses available for use in public transportation from 1992-2009.

Graph 1 displays the estimated number of alternative energy vehicles from 1992-2009. The visual representation of the data is that of an S-curve, which can be conceptually applied to the life cycle of many other transportation technologies. [[File:Predicted and Actual Alternative Fuel Bus Graph.pdf|thumb|Graph 1]]

In addition to the display of the estimated number of alternative energy buses available for use as heavy-duty public transportation vehicles in the U.S., an Ordinary Least Squares (logistic) regression was used to estimate the following logistic function:
S(t) = K/[1+exp(-b(t-t0)]

Where:
S(t) is the status measure, which is number of alternative energy buses
t is time (annual, 1992-2009), 
t0 is the inflection time (year in which 1/2 of the saturation of the number of alt. energy buses, is achieved), 
K is saturation status level,
b is a coefficient, measuring an amount of impact on the independent variable.
Through the OLS logistic regression, multiple iterations are completed to find the 3 parameter estimated coefficients that create the “line of best fit,” and therefore have the highest adjusted R2 value in the logistic regression output. K, as previously mentioned, is the saturation level of the transportation technology. In the case of alternative energy buses, it represents the maturity of alternative energy bus systems in the market. After multiple iterations of tested values of K, the optimal results are listed in the summary table below (K = 41,000).

As reported in Table 1, the Adjusted R2 of .9361 is significant at the standard 90th percentile; the closer the R2 is to 1, the more statistically accurate the regression formula is in predicting the values for the status of the technology. In this particular application, the Adjusted R2 value, in conjunction with the value of the T Statistic, broadly states that the equation can explain approximately 94% of the variance in the number of alternative energy vehicles (and therefore inflection and saturation points) over time.[[File:Regression Output Table.pdf|thumb|Table 1]]

The estimated inflection year, which indicates the point when the rate of growth of the vehicles begins to slow, is approximately 2009 (intercept of -341.94/-(b of .1701)). With these two estimates, the model is generally estimating that the infancy stage of the alternative energy bus technology could generally be considered between 1992 and 2009. The period following 2009 until the saturation level of 41,000 vehicles implies a general period of continued growth, and the time period following the saturation level of K=41,000 is that of maturity for the technology.

It seems particularly challenging to identify the accuracy of the equation, especially in a practical application, for multiple reasons. Of course, the estimation of the share of alternative energy vehicles is challenging, as well as the large categorization of hybrid-electric, electric, and compressed natural gas vehicles. Finally, the share of heavy-duty buses that these vehicles hold is certainly in a young stage, but the inflection year of 2009 is also likely to change once the 2010 number of vehicles in the market data is released. As a share of vehicles, the 2010 measure for alternative energy buses increased from 30.4% up to approximately 35%. However, with all of this aside, the R2 and T-statistics suggest that the equation is relatively accurate in explaining the variance in the number of alternative energy vehicles over time.

Graph 2, if only anecdotally, suggests additionally interesting information to keep the analysis of the life cycle of alternative energy vehicles in perspective. Although the equation estimates the inflection year of 2009, the data below shows the proportion of the market of alternate energy buses, as well as the number of vehicle total miles for alternative and conventional buses. Because the share of the market dropped in 2009 for alternative vehicles, and the number of vehicle miles decreased significantly, the data here suggests that an inflection year of 2009 may be too early (or late) of a prediction

== Qualitative Analysis - Hybrid-Electric Buses ==

=== Technology===

Despite the data limitations in public transit buses present due to the lack of segmentation by vehicle type, this analysis shall focus largely on the main emerging technology within the alternative energy source sub-population, the Hybrid Electric Bus. However, a brief overview of the other significant alternative energy source buses will also be provided at the end of the analysis.
 

A hybrid electric bus (HEB) combines a conventional model of the internal combustion engine (ICE) with an electric system, used for propulsion, regenerative energy, or as an independent power source, depending on the alignment of the power-train system in the HEB. Series, parallel, and blended hybrids are the generally how the power sources are sub-categorized among HEBs; a series has no mechanical connection between the engine and drive axle. Instead, the engine sends power to the generator, which then powers an electric motor. Conversely, the parallel hybrid’s engine powers the generator, which can either charge directly drive the vehicle’s axle or charge the battery pack. The self-descriptive blended HEB is a combination of the two power alignment schemes, as displayed in Diagram A [[File:Parallel and Series Hybrid Diagram.jpg|thumb|Diagram A - Parallel and Series Hybrid Design]] &lt;ref&gt;London, Transport for. Hybrid Buses. 2011. http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/2019.aspx (accessed October 7, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Advantages ===

The hybrid electric bus has multiple environmental advantages over the conventional diesel bus. Perhaps the most widely cited environmental benefit of the HEB is the reduction of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxides, and hydrocarbon emissions that contribute to broad and local environmental and health problems. In addition to the resultant reduction in greenhouse gases and localized ozone, an air pollutant related to many human respiratory problems, HEBs also have lower levels of particulate matter and carbon monoxide emitted than conventional diesel buses. Similar to ozone, both of these pollutants can cause significant damage to the human respiratory and immune system, and high concentrations of the emissions are considered significant health problems.


In addition to the reduction of harmful emissions, the decreased use of petroleum based fuel offers a potentially significant cost reduction for transit agencies over time. According to the Federal Transit Administration, fuels costs are only second to labor costs in the operating expenses of a transit agency, and HEBs have recorded fuel economy increases ranging from 10% to 48%, relative to a conventionally powered diesel bus. The HEB system has a particularly positive effect on fuel consumption in urban driving situations and during rush hour. The regenerative breaking process converts kinetic energy from the braking process into energy that can be stored in the generator and eventually used to power the HEB. Because of this, this powering system is ideal for city buses, which brake and accelerate frequently. 

=== Significant Markets ===

Within the U.S., most transit agencies are motivated to shift their vehicles in their fleet to alternative energy sources by local political actors, such as environmental advocacy groups, as well as environmental commitments to reduce emissions and improve air quality above or beyond EPA regulations. New York City, although it is inherently prone to higher levels of toxic emissions because of its congested nature, is an excellent example of a region or locality that chose to divert from conventional diesel buses due to pressure on the local and national level; the City had not achieved the air quality attainment goals set in the EPA’s 1990 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and the increasing public awareness of health problems related to the harmful emissions, as well as growing state and national pressures to reduce emissions led NYC’s Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) to replace its entire fleet over a decade, and began this environmentally oriented endeavor in the mid 1990s. HEBs were not widely available until the late 1990s, so NYC opted for a significant investment in the natural gas re-filling infrastructure to support a fleet of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) buses. However, since converting its entire fleet of heavy-duty buses away from conventional diesel power systems, NYC has also invested in HEBs. As part of the largest alternative energy bus fleet in the world and the largest transit bus operator in North America, MTA now regularly operates over 600 HEBs&lt;ref&gt;New York Power Authority. Clean Transportation. 2011. www.nypa.gov/ev/cleantransportationprograms.htm (accessed October 5, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;.


The California Air Resources Board (ARB) has also played a major role in influencing the growth of HEB use in the U.S. In response to EPA regulations regarding diesel fuel and engine performance, such as the Clean Air Act, the ARB declared the particulate matter emissions from diesel engines as a known human carcinogen in 1998. Since then, the ARB and California’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment have studied the health impacts and risks due to diesel emissions and implemented further rules to decrease emissions throughout the state, such as the 2000 Diesel Risk Reduction Plan. The measure, which aimed to drastically reduce diesel emissions by 2010, in addition to its specific 14 point plan, influenced the adoption of vehicles such as HEBs. The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, signed by then Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, has provided another incentive for the increased use of HEBs through the state’s urban areas; as part of the Act, the ARB is required to reduce greenhouse gases by 25% by 2020, and the board’s enforcement of the reduction required forced technology upgrades for heavy-duty conventional buses, such as the retrofitting of new and existing engines with particulate matter filters to reduce emissions. Additionally, the Act required the increased use of low sulfur diesel fuel.
In addition to the adoption of HEBs in New York City, as well as early adoption in Los Angeles following a successful trial period in the notoriously polluted city, another trial adoption of the HEB technology in the U.S. did not have as much of a picturesque outcome. Cedar Rapids, Iowa proposed a cold-climate trial of the batteries needed to operate a hybrid-electric powertrain and electric buses to add to its public bus fleet to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) in the early 1990s, and received over $10 million to purchase, operate, and maintain 5 HEBs and 4 electric buses. The FTA funding was also used for the construction of a facility, infrastructure for charging the batteries, and training&lt;ref&gt;Transportation Research Board. TCRP Report 59: Hybrid-Electric Transit Buses. Transit Cooperative Research Program, Federal Transit Administration, Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;. 


Prior to the hybrid-electric and electric testing, the moderately sized city of 100,000 had tested alternative fuels such as CNG, LP gas, hydrogen injection, ethanol, and bio-diesel since 1987. Following the implementation of the four electric buses in 1995, three HEBs were introduced in November of 1997, and the other two followed within three years. Amidst the six year evaluation process after the final HEB was added to the fleet (2000), an FTA analysis of the project anticipated that the city could overcome training, electronic, and mechanical issues it often had with the vehicles and see rewards from the significant investment. Despite the average fuel economy increase of 15% and improved emissions to help bring Cedar Rapids up to attainment of the NAAQS for ozone, issues such as battery size, financial feasibility of improved battery technology, maintenance, and reliability outweighed the benefits, and city officials sold the buses in an online public auction for $30,000 in 2008. The mothballed vehicles, which only had a collective 200,000 miles logged, had an added purchase requirement that required the winning bidder to haul the buses away, which seemed to imply that Cedar Rapids could not get the fleet out of its hands quickly enough.

=== Life Cycle of Hybrid-Electric Bus ===
==== Birth of Hybrid Technology ====

Conceptually, the idea of powering a vehicle with an electric source has been privately tested for over a century. Electric vehicles were introduced into the London taxi market and even produced in Connecticut in the late 1800s, and continued to develop until approximately 1920. A hiatus from the electric based automobile in the U.S. from 1920-1965 ended with the introduction of multiple bills in Congress advocating for electric automobiles as a method to reduce air pollutants emitted by the conventional ICE in 1966 &lt;ref&gt;Hybrid Cars. History of Hybrid Vehicles. June 13, 2011. www.hybridcars.com (accessed October 6, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;. Eventually, the commercial development of the modern hybrid started growing in the late 1980’s and early 1990s. Toyota, who released the first commercially accepted hybrid automobile in 1997, the Prius, started development in 1993 &lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Alex III. &quot;The Birth of the Prius.&quot; Fortune, February 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;. 1997 was also the release year Toyota’s Coaster Minibus, which it claimed as the first heavy-duty HEB, but this release wasn’t quite as established as the market’s first. Other commercial developers claimed their release as the first in the HEB market; Gillig Corporation released its own HEB model in 1996.  

==== Growth and Saturation of Alternative Energy Buses ====

Despite Cedar Rapids’ negative account of alternative energy heavy-duty buses, vast improvements in technology, such as battery weight and lifespan, training, and maintenance knowledge have specifically contributed to an increase in the adoption of HEBs since their introduction into the market. International, private companies, striving to meet the increased demand for efficient vehicles with lower emissions, contributed largely to the initial increase in technology that would have helped a case like the FTA trial in Iowa. Cedar Rapids had specifically identified a battery that was significantly lighter than the one ton batteries it maintained; the batteries, which also had vast improvements in maximum operating length, were developed by a German company, but were simply too expensive due to a tariff at the time Transportation Research Board&lt;ref&gt;Transportation Research Board. TCRP Report 59: Hybrid-Electric Transit Buses. Transit Cooperative Research Program, Federal Transit Administration, Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;.


Although transit fleet managers continue to search for methods to lower costs, decrease emissions, and satisfy related interest groups, the Diesel Emissions Reduction Acts (DERA) of 2005 and 2010 may be encouraging less growth in the alternative energy heavy-buses, including HEBs. The 2005 Act provided $200 million/year for five years for congressional appropriations to encourage a major reduction in diesel emissions. Although the $10 million in appropriations were never fully funded, $300 million was added to the incentive program in 2009 as a one-time stimulus, and the 2010 Act reauthorized the bill for another five years, which matches the actual $500 million that was appropriated from 2005 through 2009&lt;ref&gt;111th Congress. &quot;Public Law 111-364.&quot; Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2010. Washington, District of Columbia, January 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;.

 
A significant outcome of DERA was, of course, a reduction in diesel emissions throughout the U.S. that ultimately becomes a significant investment in public health; every $1 spent by the DERA program (which often is a match to local and state expenditures on the diesel emission reduction) is estimated to yield between $13 and $28 in improved health (benefits) to individuals due to decreased cancer, asthma, and other health improvements related to strengthened respiratory and immune systems&lt;ref&gt;Kassel, Rich. National Resources Defense Council. January 5, 2011. http://nrdc.org/president_obama_signs_diesel_e.html (accessed October 9, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;. The practical implications of the incentive program, however, shifted the focus away from decreasing or eliminating the use of petroleum-based fuels. Particulate matter filters, which have decreased diesel emissions to a level almost identical to HEBs, were developed and retrofitted to conventional diesel bus fleets at a significantly lower cost than the investment otherwise required to adopt alternative vehicles, such as HEBs, into a fleet.


Although preliminary figures for 2010 from the APTA signal an increase in the market share of alternative fuel heavy-duty buses in the U.S., the DERA seemed to perpetuate some lock-in issues present with conventional diesel technology&lt;ref&gt;American Public Transportation Assocation. &quot;2010 Vehicle Survey.&quot; 2010 Public Transportation Factbook. Washington, D.C.: American Public Transportation Association, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;. The high costs associated with the infrastructure, training, and battery replacement and disposal, which is still a significant and untested variable in the cost structure of alternative heavy-duty vehicles like the HEB, are simply too overwhelming to justify a major switch in bus technology and new capital investment for transit agencies. Instead, the upgrades in technology on the existing diesel vehicles are widespread and much less expensive for agencies to implement.


Although the saturation model suggests that the inflection year for alternative energy heavy-duty buses compared to conventional buses is 2005, technology such as the HEB seems to have more of an uncertain future than the model may suggest. Heightened awareness to the extraction of oil, burning of petroleum based fuels, and imminent international pressure for the U.S. to join the European Union and other prominent nations in the drastic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions may have impacts on the alternative heavy-duty bus market that simply cannot be predicted at this point.

==== Moving forward with HEB technology ==== 

FTA research, in combination with improvements in international trade agreements that will improve U.S. access to new and future technology, show a hopeful future for alternative energy heavy-duty bus development. February of 2010 saw the signing of the first science and technology agreement between the United States and Germany, which provides a framework for cooperation and will bring multiple research entities together to address “cross-cutting scientific issues” &lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State - Office of the Spokesman. &quot;United States and Germany Sign First Science and Technology Agreement.&quot; U.S. Department of State. February 18, 2010. http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2010/02/136914.htm (accessed October 6, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;. Additionally, the countries signed a memorandum to initiate further research cooperation to address energy, climate change, and health issues, among others. Multiple German companies have produced innovative research and developed advanced batteries and bus technologies that have been helpful in advancing HEBs in the U.S., and this agreement facilitates an even larger sharing of technological advances in the future.


Not unlike any other rapidly evolving technology, the hybrid-electric bus has its drawbacks. As demonstrated through the FTA trial in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, intricate maintenance management, technical training, battery weight, and the technical design of powertrain, including the battery, are all invaluable in the successful implementation of HEBs. As technology continues to improve (ex. the dramatic reduction in the size and weight of the battery), the higher maintenance and training costs inherent in the relative infancy of a technology are equally stressed by a 2010 FTA assessment of hybrid-electric technology. Additionally, the complexity of the electric drive components will likely increase overall maintenance costs. However, as the technology matures in the long run, maintenance costs and unfamiliar complexities will naturally decrease, and have the potential fall below similar costs related to conventional diesel buses because of decreased repairs on transmission and brake linings &lt;ref&gt;Brecher, Dr. Aviva. Assessment of Needs and Research Roadmaps for Rechargeable Energy Storage System - Onboard Electric Drive Buses. Innovation and Research Needs Assessment, Washington, D.C.: Federal Transit Administration - U.S. Department of Transportation, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;.


==== Hybrid Electric Buses vs. Other Alternative Energy Buses ====

CNG buses were the dominant alternative energy bus technology when HEBs entered the market, and maintain a presence in the bus fleet; the APTA Fact Book shows an estimation of 11% of the total bus fleet as of the end of 2004. Related to the earlier discussion of New York City’s CNG fleet, many transit agencies are more reluctant to deploy CNG buses because of the overhead infrastructure costs related to establishing a fueling location for the vehicles and installing compressors. At the time of New York’s initial investment, CNG was the main commercially viable clean fuel alternative to the conventional diesel bus&lt;ref&gt;Northeast Advance Vehicle Consortium. Analysis of Electric Drive Technologies for Transit Applications. Final Report, Washington, D.C.: Federal Transit Administration, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;. Although the life cycle cost of a CNG bus usually falls below that of a HEB, the fuel efficiency is also lower than HEBs and conventional diesel buses. Although they become more attractive when liquid fuel prices increase but the price of natural gas remains stable, pricing trends for different fuels usually follow one another. 


An alternative to HEBs an CNG buses, electric buses also have a small presence in the alternative fuel market for heavy-duty buses, but have similar drawbacks to HEBs regarding the battery technology. Although they provide an even smoother and quieter ride compared to the HEB, which is an improvement over the noise and vibration of the conventional diesel ICE, pure battery buses have energy storage capacity and battery cost issues that have stopped the buses from being a viable vehicle for most applications of public transit. In addition to these problems of sufficient traveling range, it is also challenging for transit agencies to take their buses out of operation for recharging. At best, pure electric buses are seen as niche market and useful for those who need a bus without emissions and may be benefited by the lack of noise; parks and indoor uses are the most viable applications for pure electric buses today.


Ultimately, fuel cell buses are seen as the long-term goal by many transit agencies, health advocates, and environmental advocates. However, doubts as to when the technology advances will actually materialize are fairly widespread. HEBs, though, are seen as a bridge from conventional diesel to a future technology. Although many issues still need to be addressed, they are regarded as a “here now” technology that also has many benefits.

      <comment>/* Integration with LMS */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There are three suggested prongs for grading an Introduction to Engineering Class:
==Quiz/Final Grading==
This book focuses on quiz/final grading. Scattered throughout the book are wikiversity quizzes that are graded instantly, and provide no feedback. Eventually these quizzes will be linked up for use inside your college's LMS. This way you can hold individual students accountable to reading this on line book, get feed back on the questions and grow your own, edit this book, etc.

The goal is not to make power point presentations of sections of this wiki book. In the first three weeks, team students up in groups of three, give them 10 minutes to prepare a presentation and then ask them to talk to the web pages. Don't let them try to control the presentation agenda through power points. Pick some sections of the book to present yourself as an example. Do the scattered quiz questions together. Give them presentation points. Make this class about them standing up and talking .. about everything.

==Project Grading==
Freshman projects need to be graded entirely on project documentation with subjectivity minimized. The majority of the grading must focus on individual work. Class time is used for presentations and project face time. Face time ideally is used to negotiate individual work. Individuals work alone over the weekend, documenting their work. During the next weeks face time, they review what was done, renegotiate and repeat the cycle. Suggested details of this can be found in [[:wikiversity:General_Engineering_Projects|wikiversity]]. 

===Instructor Project Grading Spreadsheet===
A gradebook spreadsheet has been made public in Google Docs. It is organized for one 3 week project, three 4 weeks projects and finals week. It just focuses on grading projects. It has a print out for each week of the semester, so grading occurs first on paper, and then is typed into the spreadsheet once the weeks grading is done.

===Student Project Grading Spreadsheet===
This is a spreadsheet for students to use to hold the instructor accountable to entering project grades correctly. Students can compute their grades in parallel with the instructor. It is formatted differently, but uses the same formulas.

===Integration with LMS===
The goal is to not burden your LMS with over 100 columns of project grading detail. Most can not handle it. It must be done in a spreadsheet with many &quot;sheets.&quot; The LMS sheet suggests that only three columns be uploaded &quot;project&quot; &quot;bucketPlus&quot; and &quot;bucketMinus.&quot; The &quot;bucketPlus&quot; and &quot;bucketMinus&quot; columns always add to zero. Your LMS must be able to can handle negative scores. 

The goal of the bucketPlus and bucketMinus is to let students know how many points they can expect to be added to their grade when the team documentation is finished. Teams will not finish &quot;We documentation&quot; without personal incentive. For more about this, read the [[:wikiversity:General_Engineering_Projects|wikiversity]] project grading pages.

==Engineering Club==
The goal is to get students connected to the engineering world outside of the college. Give them points for arranging speakers, tours, visiting hackerspaces, working with engineering associations, and working on club &quot;projects.&quot; Club projects could be documented using this same system with perhaps different funding.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Vitanza, Victor J. &quot;Critical Sub/versions of the History of Philosophical Rhetoric.&quot;Rhetoric Review 
6.1 (1987): 41-66.'''

Vitanza creates a critical charge for a “post-philosophical Rhetoric” (which is at once nondisciplinary and “the grandest of all mega-sciences or mega-disciplines” [41-42]) by way of metaphorically rendering the privileging of Philosophy in relation to Rhetoric as a “logico-philosophical (meta)disciplinary” (48) infection which Plato Aristotle are responsible for. The ‘Antibody Rhetoric’ which Vitanza incites, that resists Philo-logical primacy of Classical Rhetoric in favor of a “Poetics of Rhetoric” (43), is a described as part of a set of “evolutions of Sophistic Rhetoric” (53). Vitanza’s nondisciplinary ‘Antibody Rhetoric’, as part of  “The Third Sophistic” (citing Jarrett 45), acknowledges  the “power of the bewitchment of language” (46) and embraces the practical value/use of metaphor and irony in order to “wage a kind of guerilla warfare conducted by the margins, that will function as a de/stabilizing principle … or a dis/stabilizing principle … in the writings of our “newer” histories” (52) which could take the form of “curative fictions” (56). By aligning his 'Antibody Rhetoric' (which isn’t the real name for his ideal Rhetoric, but rather a way of referring to its function [the Rhetoric Vitanza envisions cannot be named because “Platonism and Aristotelianism, old or new, would not allow for it” [42]) to Sophistic Rhetoric, Vitanza sketches out a space and working definition for Sophism that is Platonically immune where Sophism takes an opposite stance to “logophilia” (quoting Pierrsens 48). In this light, Sophism is defined by its appreciation of the playful, the expressive, and the poetic, as opposed to the philological.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''FORA Description'''

FORA is a dynamically typed, functional programming language. It provides many of the benefits of high-level dynamic languages like Python or R, including:

# faster programmer iterations because there’s no compile step
# conciseness of code because FORA doesn’t require type annotations
# greater reusability of general-purpose code. Algorithms depend only on the behavior of the objects they’re manipulating, not the types of those objects.

FORA code executes as quickly as code written in statically typed, like Java (compiled to bytecode and run on a Virtual Machine) or compiled languages like C++. 

FORA achieves these speedups by employing dynamic optimization techniques. FORA runs all new code in an interpreter, collecting statistics about the types and values of the objects it’s manipulating. A separate thread determines which code is “hot,” attempts to generate strongly-typed code equivalent to the dynamically typed code, and then produces optimized machine code.

== Elemental Overview ==

The elements of the periodic table are all different types of atoms that make up the structural basis for all existence. There are over 100, and each element (atom) contains a small dense positive charge, known as the nucleus of the atom. Outside the nucleus is a relatively much lighter orbiting cloud of negatively charged electrons. For every electron there is a mutual proton (a positively charged particle)in the nucleus as well to balance the charge of the atom, and it is in the number of protons that an atom finds its uniqueness and identification. For instance, one of the most common of all elements in the universe is hydrogen.  Hydrogen has 1 proton, 1 electron, and sometimes 1 or 2 neutrons (neutrally charged particles, also found in the nucleus). Since it has 1 proton, it is given the number 1 on the periodic table.

[[File:Periodic_table_(polyatomic).svg|Periodic Table of Elements]]

The electrons in orbit around each element dictates not only its location on the table, but also how it interacts with other elements. Each element has a set of orbits of electrons surrounding in it, and depending on the number of electrons and the orbitals they occupy, determines what it shares its electrons with. The periodic table is split this way to distinguish between elements that are electron deficient (left side; alkaline and earth metals), also deficient but all have an incomplete d-orbital (middle; transition metals), electron rich (right side; nonmetals), and full orbitals and therefore incapable of reacting (far right; halogens).

== Electron Orbitals ==
 
As mentioned before each element has a cloud of electrons surrounding it, and depending on that number dictates how it behaves and interacts with other elements. There are four different orbitals that electrons can occupy: S, P, D, and F. The s-orbital requires two electrons to become full, while the p orbital requires six, the d-orbital needs ten, and the f-orbital can take to fourteen! The f-orbital is used only by elements of rare usage and artificial creation in the lab and can be worried about in college. The number of electrons fill these orbitals is dependant on the element’s atomic number. Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1, meaning it has one electron. This one electron goes to fill to the s-orbital half way. Each pair of electrons that orbit an element requires one to be “spinning up” while the other electron “spins down” to create stability for the atom. An overall rule on how chemistry and all the world works is everything wants to find the state of most stability, which means an atom is most happy with a full pair of electrons to stabilize it. Since hydrogen only has one electron it is rarely found just as mono-atomic Hydrogen, but instead H2. Existing as this diatomic element found in abundance in the atmosphere would be highly reactive if split into just one hydrogen.

The next element after hydrogen is helium and it has an atomic number of two, with two electrons filling the s-orbital. No loose electrons, which means helium should be very stable? Not only is helium very stable but all the elements that share a column with it also share this full orbital configuration (starting to notice a pattern to the periodic table?)
As you travel down the periodic table (and up in atomic numbers) the more orbitals like p and d get filled. The electrons are distributed as such (with the leading number representing the orbital number and the last number showing the number of electrons): '''1S2 2S2 2P6 3S2 3P6 4S2 3D10 4P6 4D10 4F14''' There is an occasional exception along the way of how the electrons are distributed for an occasional element, otherwise the periodic table serves as an excellent way to quickly determine the orbital of an element based on trends in the table.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''The use of Resistance Training in the Prevention and Treatment of Osteoporosis in the Elderly''' ==
&lt;small&gt;
==== What is Osteoporosis? ====
It is the decrease in bone density that enhances bone fragility and increases the risk of fractures and falls in the elderly. &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Bone re-absorption outweighs bone deposit as a result of osteoblasts becoming less effective due to aging, adding to age related bone loss. The composition of the bone matrix remains normal, it is bone mass that is reduced and becomes porous and light.

==== Possible Causes ====
The elderly are effected due to:
:* Inadequate physical activity - which causes a decrease in bone mineral density 
:* A poor diet
:* Previous chronic disease or injury [[File:Bone density scanner.jpg|thumb|right|125px|Bone Density Scanner]] 
:* Genetic factors such as race, frame size and/or family history may also have a negative effect

==== Diagnosis ==== 
First your GP will assess your risk factors for osteoporosis, including age, medical history and lifestyle.
Osteoporosis is diagnosed through a bone density test (Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry; DXA).&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; - ''(See picture right)'' 
It measures the density (strength) of your bones, usually at the hip and spine. The result from this test is called a T-score. This score will either be: Normal: (higher than -1), Osteopenia: (low bone density): between -1 and -2.5 or Osteoporosis: (-2.5 or lower) &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;

==== Prevention Methods ====
'''The first indicator of osteoporosis is often a fracture. This is why prevention strategies are ESSENTIAL.'''  
:* Have a healthy dietary intake – in particular calcium and protein intake. 
:* Regular participation in physical activity, most importantly resistance training (''Refer to Table 1'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
:* Quit smoking and decrease alcohol consumption
:* Increasing your exposure to limited sunlight to correct any vitamin D deficiencies, or with supplementation
:* Falls prevention measures (as falls can lead to fractures)

==== Treatment ====
:* Medication to stop further bone loss and prevent fractures &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; (Bisphosphonates,Strontium Ranelat and Monoclonal Antibodies (denosumab))
:* Hormone Replacement Therapy - Slows loss of bone but does not reverse osteoporosis
:* Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERMS)&lt;sup&gt;2,4,5&lt;/sup&gt; - Mimics estrogen bone sparing properties without targeting breasts or uterus.
:* Calcium and Vitamin D supplements &lt;sup&gt;2,5&lt;/sup&gt; 
:* Drinking fluoridated water - helps to harden the bones


==&lt;big&gt; Resistance Training in the Prevention and Treatment of Osteoporosis &lt;/big&gt;==

Regularly performed resistance training can offset the age related declines in bone health by  maintaining or increasing bone mineral density. &lt;sup&gt;3,6&lt;/sup&gt; Resistance training may also reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures by improving dynamic balance, muscle mass and overall level of physical activity. &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Benefits increase with additional hormonal and nutritional factors &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

==== Recommendations &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ====
[[File:TwoDumbbells.JPG|thumb|right|70px|Dumbbells can be used for resistance exercise]]
:*Pre-existing medical conditions, exercise progression and nutritional status should be evaluated and risk factor questionnaire. 
:*Exercise should focus on all areas of the body.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
:*Less intensive exercise to start with. E.g. Using own body weight over a shorter period initially. 
:*Progress into more intense exercises such as use of medicine balls and free weights. 
:*Depending on individuals' capabilities, can add high velocity and power. 
:*An increase of daily physical activity levels in areas such as transport, walking up stairs.
==== Table 1. Resistance Training Program &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ==== 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Intensity!! Frequency !! Duration !! Progression !! Goals !! Considerations
|-
| 15 reps of 8-10 exercises || 2 days per week || 1 or 2 sets up to 30-60 mins || Add a set after initial 2 weeks || 3 – 4 days per week at 10-12 reps per set || Avoid spinal flexion. Use slow and controlled movements. Target legs and back.
|}

==== Safety Considerations &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ====
:*Warm up &amp; down 5-10 minutes before each exercise session, incorporating low to moderate activity, including stretching  
:*Allow 48-72hrs recovery between sessions, which will also lessen the likelihood of over-training
:*Arrange a motion for each exercise that is pain free.
:*Ensure they have had advice from medical staff and quality supervision by an instructor or medical professional.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is COPD? ==

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is defined by the Global Obstructive Lung Disease group as a disease state charachterised by airflow limitation that is '''not fully reversible''', unlike asthma &lt;ref&gt;Malipatil, V. &amp; McDonald, C., F. Management of Older People with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research. 39(4):302-6, 2009 Schneider, C. Health Promotion for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Health Promotion. 30(6):472-474, 2010 &lt;/ref&gt;. The air flow limitation is usually both '''progressive''' and associated with an '''abnormal inflammatory response''' of the lungs to noxious particles or gases &lt;ref&gt;Malipatil, V. &amp; McDonald, C., F. Management of Older People with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research. 39(4):302-6, 2009, Schneider, C. Health Promotion for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Health Promotion. 30(6):472-474, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;.

COPD usually presents in mid-life (around 40 years and onwards) with slowly progressive symptoms &lt;ref&gt;Moderate Exercise May Reduce Risk of COPD in Smokers. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. 175:458, 2007 &amp; Breathe Easier – Your Guide to COPD. http://www.lungfoundation.com.au 15/09/2011 [Accessed 18/10/2011]&lt;/ref&gt; COPD generally arises following a long smoking history and results in a largely irreversible airflow limitation &lt;ref&gt;Breathe Easier – Your Guide to COPD. http://www.lungfoundation.com.au 15/09/2011 [Accessed 18/10/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Causes ==


=== Smoking ===

Cigarette smoking causes the majority of COPD cases &lt;ref&gt;Moderate Exercise May Reduce Risk of COPD in Smokers. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. 175:458, 2007 Malipatil, V. &amp; McDonald, C., F. Management of Older People with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research. 39(4):302-6, 2009 &amp; Breathe Easier – Your Guide to COPD. http://www.lungfoundation.com.au 15/09/2011 [Accessed 18/10/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;. Cigarette smoke is thought to release enzymes that damage a protein called elastin, which makes the lungs elastic &lt;ref&gt;Moderate Exercise May Reduce Risk of COPD in Smokers. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. 175:458, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;. Smoking is also believed to inactivate alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), a protein produced by the liver that normally protects elastin from the action of these enzymes &lt;ref&gt;Moderate Exercise May Reduce Risk of COPD in Smokers. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. 175:458, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Environmental Exposure ===

COPD can also occur in people who have had long-term exposure to things that irritate your lungs, like certain chemicals, dust, or fumes in the workplace &lt;ref&gt;Malipatil, V. &amp; McDonald, C., F. Management of Older People with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research. 39(4):302-6, 2009 Breathe Easier – Your Guide to COPD. http://www.lungfoundation.com.au 15/09/2011 [Accessed 18/10/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;. Occupational exposure may be responsible for 20 - 30% of COPD. Heavy or long-term exposure to second-hand smoke or other air pollutants may also contribute to COPD.

=== Genetic Factors ===

In some people, COPD is caused by a genetic condition known as alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency &lt;ref&gt;Malipatil, V. &amp; McDonald, C., F. Management of Older People with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research. 39(4):302-6, 2009, Breathe Easier – Your Guide to COPD. http://www.lungfoundation.com.au 15/09/2011 [Accessed 18/10/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;. People with this AAT deficiency can develop COPD even if they have never smoked or had long-term exposure to harmful pollutants before. In these susceptible individuals, exposure to noxious gases or particles can result in chronic inflammation with tissue injury, ineffective repair and structural changes &lt;ref&gt;Malipatil, V. &amp; McDonald, C., F. Management of Older People with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research. 39(4):302-6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender Factors ===

Some studies have shown that women may be at greater risk  than men of COPD from exposures at work and are more susceptible to COPD due to smaller lungs and airways and more sensitive airways &lt;ref&gt;Breathe Easier – Your Guide to COPD. http://www.lungfoundation.com.au 15/09/2011 [Accessed 18/10/2011&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Forms of COPD ==

COPD can generally be classified into one of two groups:
&lt;u&gt;Chronic Bronchitis&lt;/u&gt; or &lt;u&gt;Emphysema (multiple forms)&lt;/u&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Queensland Health and The Australian Lung Foundation Better Living with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. A Patient Guide. www.lungnet.com.au 2008 [18/10/2011], Roberts, D., H. &amp; Levenson, C., R. The Case for exercise in managing chronic lung disease. Harvard Women’s Watch. 2008, Moderate Exercise May Reduce Risk of COPD in Smokers. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. 175:458, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Chronic Bronchitis ===
Chronic Bronchitis is a recurrent problem, defined as the presence of cough and sputum production for at least 3 months in each of 2 consecutive years &lt;ref&gt;Moderate Exercise May Reduce Risk of COPD in Smokers. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. 175:458, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;. The condition reduces the diameter of the airways through a combination of airway inflammation and overproduction of mucus &lt;ref&gt;Moderate Exercise May Reduce Risk of COPD in Smokers. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. 175:458, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;. Chronic bronchitis is more prevalent in women than in men &lt;ref&gt;Moderate Exercise May Reduce Risk of COPD in Smokers. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. 175:458, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Emphysema ===
Emphysema is defined in structural and pathological terms as the abnormal and permanent enlargement of air spaces distal to the terminal bronchioles accompanied with destruction of their walls &lt;ref&gt;Moderate Exercise May Reduce Risk of COPD in Smokers. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. 175:458, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;. In emphysema, the [[/alveoli/]] are gradually destroyed so people have difficulty absorbing enough oxygen. The [[/bronchi/]] become inelastic and narrow making it harder to breathe in and out (26 &amp; 29). These days, smoking is the most common cause of emphysema &lt;ref&gt;Breathe Easier – Your Guide to COPD. http://www.lungfoundation.com.au 15/09/2011 [Accessed 18/10/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;. It is also most prevalent among men aged over 65 years &lt;ref&gt;Moderate Exercise May Reduce Risk of COPD in Smokers. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. 175:458, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Issue ==

* Cigarette smoking is the primary cause of COPD &lt;ref&gt;Moderate Exercise May Reduce Risk of COPD in Smokers. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. 175:458, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;. 

* The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that there are presently 1.1 billions smokers worldwide and that this figure will increase to 1.6 billion by 2025 in low and middle-income countries (Reference from WHO).

* In the year 2000 there was an estimated 2.74 millions deaths worldwide from COPD alone.

* COPD currently affects over 2 million Australians &lt;ref&gt;Queensland Health and The Australian Lung Foundation Better Living with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. A Patient Guide. www.lungnet.com.au 2008 [18/10/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;.

* COPD is the leading cause of death in the Australian population (4th for males, 6th for females) and was responsible for 5,152 deaths in 2007. &lt;ref&gt;Schneider, C. Health Promotion for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Health Promotion. 30(6):472-474, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1990, COPD was ranked 12th as a burden of disease and this is projected to reach 5th by 2020.

* In the US COPD has an estimated 15% prevalence in those aged over 65 years and accounts for 20% of hospitalisations of older people &lt;ref&gt;Malipatil, V. &amp; McDonald, C., F. Management of Older People with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research. 39(4):302-6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;.

* The real prevalence of COPD is likely to be under-estimated due to the under-diagnosis or misdiagnosis of the disease &lt;ref&gt;Leung, WM., R., Alison, J., A., McKeough, Z., J. &amp; Peters, M., J. Ground walk training improves functional exercise capacity more than cycle training in people with chronic obstrcutive pulmonary disease (COPD): a randomised trial. Journal of Pysiotherapy. 56:105-112, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;.


=== How serious is COPD? ===

A 'Quality of Life' study was performed on both COPD patients and patients with inoperable lung cancer, finding:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!             !! COPD !! Lung Cancer
|-
| '''Housebound''' || 80% || 36%
|-
| '''Chair-bound''' || 36% || 10%
|}


An international study measuring the prevalence of COPD determined that 19.2% of a population sample, 40 years and over (n=562) in Sydney demonstrated lung function consistent with a diagnosis of COPD. The study found 10.2% of the sample had lung function consistent with moderate to severe COPD. &lt;ref&gt;Schneider, C. Health Promotion for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Health Promotion. 30(6):472-474, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==

Indicators of COPD include:

''Chronic Cough:'' Present intermittently or every day. Often present throughout the day; seldom only nocturnal &lt;ref&gt;Schneider, C. Health Promotion for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Health Promotion. 30(6):472-474, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;.

''Chronic Sputum Production:'' Any pattern of chronic sputum production may indicate COPD &lt;ref&gt;Schneider, C. Health Promotion for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Health Promotion. 30(6):472-474, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;.

''Acute Bronchitis:'' Repeated episodes &lt;ref&gt;Schneider, C. Health Promotion for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Health Promotion. 30(6):472-474, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;.

''[[/Dyspnea/]] that is:'' Progressive, persistent, worse with exercise, and worse during respiratory infections &lt;ref&gt;Schneider, C. Health Promotion for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Health Promotion. 30(6):472-474, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;.

''History of Exposure to Risk Factors:'' Including tobacco smoke, occupational dusts and chemicals, smoke from home cooking and heating fuel e.g. coal &lt;ref&gt;Schneider, C. Health Promotion for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Health Promotion. 30(6):472-474, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Note:''' Please note that diagnosis should always be confirmed by [[/'''Spirometry'''/]]


COPD is usually classified by severity, from mild to moderate to severe.


=== Mild COPD ===

In mild COPD, symptoms may only include the need to cough up mucus each morning. Symptoms such as shortness of breath, coughing or coughing up mucus might only occur during winter or after a cold. 


=== Moderate COPD ===

In moderate COPD, above symptoms are present almost every day, including feeling out of breath after exertion such as walking quickly, having trouble doing every day chores as a result of breathlessness, and it may take several weeks to recover from a cold or chest infection.


=== Severe COPD ===

In severe COPD, above symptoms will be present every day and shortness of breath will be present during normal daily activities such as taking a shower or getting the mail.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== COPD Management ==
While there is '''no cure''' for COPD and the airway damage cannot be repaired, all the symptoms can be reduced by following certain management strategies &lt;ref&gt;Queensland Health and The Australian Lung Foundation Better Living with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. A Patient Guide. www.lungnet.com.au 2008 [18/10/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;. Including:

*Prevent disease progression i.e. stop smoking - only smoking cessation and oxygen therapy (in significant [[/hypoxaemia/]]) have shown improved mortality in COPD &lt;ref&gt;Queensland Health and The Australian Lung Foundation Better Living with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. A Patient Guide. www.lungnet.com.au 2008 [18/10/2011], Schneider, C. Health Promotion for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Health Promotion. 30(6):472-474, 2010, Malipatil, V. &amp; McDonald, C., F. Management of Older People with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research. 39(4):302-6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;.

- Concern about post-cessation weight gain has been identified as a barrier to smoking cessation for women, perhaps contributing to their lower cessation rates &lt;ref&gt;Schneider, K., L., Pagoto, S., L., &amp; Spring, B. Affective Benefits of Exercise While Quitting Smoking: Influence of Smoking Specific Weight Concern. Psychology of Addictive Behaviours. 21(2):255-260, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

- Smoking Specific Weight Concern (SSWC) is a barrier to cessation for female smokers&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, K., L., Pagoto, S., L., &amp; Spring, B. Affective Benefits of Exercise While Quitting Smoking: Influence of Smoking Specific Weight Concern. Psychology of Addictive Behaviours. 21(2):255-260, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;.

- SSWC refers to a belief that smoking plays an important role in maintaining weight and that quitting will result in weight gain &lt;ref&gt;Schneider, K., L., Pagoto, S., L., &amp; Spring, B. Affective Benefits of Exercise While Quitting Smoking: Influence of Smoking Specific Weight Concern. Psychology of Addictive Behaviours. 21(2):255-260, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== The Importance of Exercise for the COPD Patient ===

Weakness, shortness of breath, and even the fear of breathlessness can cause people with COPD to avoid physical activity &lt;ref&gt;Get Physical with COPD. www.HopkinsAfter50.com 2004 [18/10/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;. This cycle of weakness, shortness of breath, and inactivity contributes to a progressive decline in muscle strength and inefficient oxygen use, making it difficult for some patients to perform Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)such as showering and dressing &lt;ref&gt;Get Physical with COPD. www.HopkinsAfter50.com 2004 [18/10/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;. As such, exercise is now recognised as an integral part of managing COPD and while it won't change the underlying structural problems in the lungs, it noes have a number of important benefits &lt;ref&gt;Get Physical with COPD. www.HopkinsAfter50.com 2004 [18/10/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;.

* Blood sugar levels, and

* Desire to smoke


- Given that exercise has been found to have a positive influence on affect in humans it is reasonable to propose that probably due to its affective influences, it might provide effective competition against smoking urges in humans &lt;ref&gt;Taylor, A., H., Katomeri, M. &amp; Ussher, M. Acute effects of self-paced walking on urges to smoke during temporary smoking abstinence. Psychopharmacology. 181:1-7, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;.

- Enhanced exercise-related affect may provide coping resources during smoking cessation &lt;ref&gt;Taylor, A., H., Katomeri, M. &amp; Ussher, M. Acute effects of self-paced walking on urges to smoke during temporary smoking abstinence. Psychopharmacology. 181:1-7, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;.

- Exercise appears to be an effective non-pharmacological method of reducing cigarette cravings and desire to smoke during temporary abstinence from smoking &lt;ref&gt;Janse Van Rensburg, K., Taylor, A., Hodgson, T &amp; Benattayallah, A. Acute exercise modulates cigarette cravings and brain activation in response to smoking-related images: an fMRI study. Psychopharmacology. 203:589-598, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== How Often Should I Exercise? ====

Those with COPD should aim to exercise for a minimum of 3 sessions per week, for at least 20 to 30 minutes per session &lt;ref&gt;Queensland Health &amp; The Australian Lung Foundation. Better Living with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. www.lungnet.com.au 2008 [18/10/2011], Get Physical with COPD. www.HopkinsAfter50.com 2004 [18/10/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== What Intensity of exercise should I be Doing? ====

The Australian Lung Foundation recommends that COPD sufferers should exercise between levels three and four on the [[/Modified Borg Dyspnea Scale/]] &lt;ref&gt;Queensland Health &amp; The Australian Lung Foundation. Better Living with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. www.lungnet.com.au 2008 [18/10/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;.

This exertion should be somewhere between 'Moderate' and 'Somewhat Severe' &lt;ref&gt;Queensland Health &amp; The Australian Lung Foundation. Better Living with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. www.lungnet.com.au 2008 [18/10/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Exercise should be undertaken at 60% of your maximal heart rate - You DO need to push yourself into  minor breathlessness in order to adapt and increase exercise tolerance. &lt;ref&gt;Get Physical with COPD. www.HopkinsAfter50.com 2004 [18/10/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;


- In order to make exercise appealing to smokers, it may be more appropriate to set lower, more realistic intensity targets, and for shorter durations &lt;ref&gt;Daniel, J., Cropley, M., Ussher, M &amp; West, R. Acute effects of shout bout of moderate versus light intensity exercise versus inactivity on tobacco withdrawal symptoms in sedentary smokers. Psychopharmacology. 174:320-326, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;.

- Moderate exercise was shown to have a delayed effect on reducing the withdrawal symptoms of restlessness, stress, tension and poor concentration, relative to light exercise of the passive control, at 5 min or 10 min post-exercise &lt;ref&gt;Daniel, J., Cropley, M., Ussher, M &amp; West, R. Acute effects of shout bout of moderate versus light intensity exercise versus inactivity on tobacco withdrawal symptoms in sedentary smokers. Psychopharmacology. 174:320-326, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;.

- One possibility is that exercising somehow mimics the effects of nicotine, since both smoking and physical activity have been shown to increase plasma catecholamines. Alternatively, the effect may be partly caused by increased common affects and enhanced energy, both central features of mood regulation theory &lt;ref&gt;Daniel, J., Cropley, M., Ussher, M &amp; West, R. Acute effects of shout bout of moderate versus light intensity exercise versus inactivity on tobacco withdrawal symptoms in sedentary smokers. Psychopharmacology. 174:320-326, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

- A program of supervised vigorous exercise is associated with long-term maintenance of smoking cessation in females &lt;ref&gt;Daniel, J., Cropley, M., Ussher, M &amp; West, R. Acute effects of shout bout of moderate versus light intensity exercise versus inactivity on tobacco withdrawal symptoms in sedentary smokers. Psychopharmacology. 174:320-326, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;.

- 5 minutes of moderate intensity exercise was effective at reducing the desire to smoke in the short term &lt;ref&gt;Daniel, J., Cropley, M., Ussher, M &amp; West, R. Acute effects of shout bout of moderate versus light intensity exercise versus inactivity on tobacco withdrawal symptoms in sedentary smokers. Psychopharmacology. 174:320-326, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== What Type of Exercise Should I be Doing? ====

Those with COPD should be looking to undertake '''aerobic activity''' to build endurance and '''resistance training''' to strengthen muscles. &lt;ref&gt;Get Physical with COPD. www.HopkinsAfter50.com 2004 [18/10/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;


Good aerobic activities include walking, cycling, stair climbing, and aquatic exercises.


Resistance exercise involves the use of free weights, special resistance bands, or resistance machines.

==== How long should I Exercise for? ====

People who have chronic lung conditions and who exercise regularly, such as walking or cycling for more than 2 hours per week can improve their health &lt;ref&gt;Queensland Health &amp; The Australian Lung Foundation. Better Living with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. www.lungnet.com.au 2008 [18/10/2011], Queensland Health &amp; The Australian Lung Foundation. Better Living with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. www.lungnet.com.au 2008 [18/10/2011] &lt;/ref&gt;. Aerobic sessions should aim to be around 20 to 30 minutes. &lt;ref&gt;Get Physical with COPD. www.HopkinsAfter50.com 2004 [18/10/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pulmonary Rehabilitation ===

Pulmonary Rehabilitation is a comprehensive program for those living with COPD who have symptoms of beathlessness and a decreased ability to perform Activities of Daily Life (ADLs) &lt;ref&gt;Watts, S. The Benefits of Pulmonary Rehabilitation. www.lungfoundation.com.au 2008 [18/10/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;. Pulmonary rehabilitation is one of the most effective interventions in COPD and has been shown to reduce symptoms, disability and handicap, reduce hospitalisation and improve function &lt;ref&gt;Pulmonary Rehabilitation. www.copdx.org.au/ [18/10/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Pulmonary rehabilitation is recognised as an essential component of the management of people with COPD and improves exercise capacity  and health-related quality of life &lt;ref&gt;Leung, WM., R., Alison, J., A., McKeough, Z., J. &amp; Peters, M., J. Ground walk training improves functional exercise capacity more than cycle training in people with chronic obstrcutive pulmonary disease (COPD): a randomised trial. Journal of Pysiotherapy. 56:105-112, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Pulmonary rehabilitation should be offered to patients with moderate to severe COPD, but can also be relevant for people with any long-term respiratory disorder characterised by dyspnoea &lt;ref&gt;Mckeough, Z Community-based pulmonary rehabilitation is effective for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Australian Journal of Physiotherapy. 55:287, 2009, Pulmonary Rehabilitation. www.copdx.org.au/ [18/10/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;.

The benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation however have been shown to decline gradually over 12 to 18 months after stopping, therefore, it is important to continue exercising post pulmonary rehabilitation &lt;ref&gt;Queensland Health &amp; The Australian Lung Foundation. Better Living with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. www.lungnet.com.au 2008 [18/10/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== What Does the Program Consist of? ====

Pulmonary Rehabilitation generally consists of an individual assessment followed by [[/exercise training/]] and [[/education/]] &lt;ref&gt;Queensland Health &amp; The Australian Lung Foundation. Better Living with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. www.lungnet.com.au 2008 [18/10/2011], Pulmonary Rehabilitation. www.copdx.org.au/ [18/10/2011], Pulmonary Rehabilitation. www.copdx.org.au/ [18/10/2011], Watts, S. The Benefits of Pulmonary Rehabilitation. www.lungfoundation.com.au 2008 [18/10/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;. Patients generally attend twice a week for around 6 - 8 weeks; however there is some evidence of dose response-effect with longer programs producing greater and more sustained benefits in exercise tolerance &lt;ref&gt;Watts, S. The Benefits of Pulmonary Rehabilitation. www.lungfoundation.com.au 2008 [18/10/2011], Pulmonary Rehabilitation. www.copdx.org.au/ [18/10/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;. At the end of the program, there is generally a re-assessment and an agreed plan is set in place detailing a future exercise plan &lt;ref&gt;Watts, S. The Benefits of Pulmonary Rehabilitation. www.lungfoundation.com.au 2008 [18/10/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Future exercise plans may include enrolling in a maintenance exercise program, joining a community-based walking group, joining a local gym or community group, exercising regularly with someone else, or participating in a home exercise program. &lt;ref&gt;Queensland Health &amp; The Australian Lung Foundation. Better Living with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. www.lungnet.com.au 2008 [18/10/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Depression &amp; Green Exercise ==
=== What is Depression &amp; What are the Symptoms? ===
Depression is a mental illness, where the sufferer experiences intense feelings of misery over an extended period of time. Symptoms include: a dysphoric mood, changes in appetite and sleeping patterns, changes in motor activity, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, diminished ability to concentrate and suicidal thoughts &lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Causes ===
Causes of depression can be biological, psychodynamic, behavioural and/or cognitive &lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;

== What is Green Exercise? ==
Green exercise is exercising outdoors while at the same time being exposed directly to nature.  It can be anything from exercising in the backyard, at a park, to walking trails or anywhere in open space, as long as it’s  not indoors!  &lt;sup&gt;[1, 2]&lt;/sup&gt;

=== How it Helps in Treating Depression &lt;sup&gt;[1, 2, 7]&lt;/sup&gt; ===
:* Improves physical health, self-esteem and mood
:* Helps you sleep better (fresh air workouts help some people sleep deeper)
:* Can strengthen the immune system by increasing the number of cells that act to fight cancer
:* Helps to reduce stress levels
:* Exercising in nature makes participants less depressed, angry, tense and confused
:* People who exercise in areas with is water present, such as lakes or rivers, show the biggest improvements in mental health
:* Promotes concentration and clear thinking

=== Benefits ===
:* It’s free! No need to pay gym membership
:* No waiting for gym equipment/machines, and no pressure to hurry up
:* Not limited by gym opening hours
:* Less likely to become bored than those who train in the gym &lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;
:* Exercise any time

== Comorbidities ==
Other behaviours such as smoking, over-eating and high alcohol consumption are coping mechanisms for depression sufferers.  Depression is also known to be a major risk factor for other chronic diseases such as asthma, arthritis, diabetes, stroke and heart disease.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;

== Costs and Occurrence ==
In 2001, 121 million people were estimated to have depression worldwide &lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;

:* Depression imposes a significant burden on patient and family well-being, health-care costs and loss of productivity &lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;.
:* By 2020, the World Health Organization estimates that depression and depression related illnesses will become the greatest source of ill health &lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;

== Recommendations for Implementing Green Exercise into my Lifestyle ==
:* Exercise in nature-it can be as simple as going for a walk around a lake/along a river, or doing yoga in the park
:* Low intensity exercise is recommended over high or moderate intensity exercise as low intensity has a tendency to keep participants exercising outdoors longer &lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;

__TOC__
[[File:Hydronephrosis.png|thumb|Hydronephrosis]]
== What is Hyponatremia? ==

Hyponatremia in runners is known as water intoxication (1). The onset of this type of hyponatremia begins when sodium levels are below 135 mEq/L (milli equivalents per litre). This occurs when the blood sodium concentration is heavily diluted by water. Sodium promotes water retention so low levels of sodium means more water loss (2). The low concentration of sodium and high content of water means that water needs to be expelled from the body quickly. As such the kidneys swell (hydronephrosis) as the cannot process the fluids quick enough to expel them. This is when the water invades the other cells in the body causing them to swell (3). If the cells in the brain swell it can become dangerous as there is not enough room in the cranium for the enlarging brain. This is known as cerebral edema, and it can be fatal.

== What Causes Hyponatremia to Occur? ==
Water intoxication occurs when a large volume of water is consumed quickly and without replacing the sodium that has been lost through sweat (4). This usually occurs towards the end of a marathon where runners are dehydrated and possibly overheating. As such they take in large volumes of water at the few opportunities they receive to do so. This is problematic as it drastically changes the sodium concentrations in the blood and causes the cellular swelling. This can cause a range of symptoms that a runner with hyponatremia will experience.

== Symptoms of Hyponatremia During a Race ==
•	Slurred speech
•	Confusion/disorientation
•	Headache
•	Muscle spasms/cramps
•	Nausea/vomiting
•	Weakness
•	Restlessness
•	Seizures
•	Significant weight gain

'''If these symptoms persist they can result in coma, kidney (hydronephrosis) and heart failure and death (5)'''

== How to Prevent Hyponatremia ==
The prevention of hyponatraemia is easily accomplished with a set plan of fluid and food consumption during an endurance event. (6)

Pre Event:
*Develop a plan of fluid and food consumption, considering the locations of the supplied drink stations on the race course.
*Adequate hydration and food consumption to prevent dehydration before the event.
During Event:
*Consume 500ml per hour over, consuming small amounts at regular intervals.
*Include a Carbohydrate-Electrolyte (CE) solution fluid to replace sodium lost through sweat
Post Event:
*One large amount of fluid consumed to replace fluids lost (varies from person to person).
*Smaller amounts (150mL every hour) over the next three hours .
*Continue to consume CE fluid with water when rehydrating to reinstate sodium balance. 

[[File:2011 Chicago Marathon runners.jpg|thumb|2011 Chicago Marathon runners]]

== Treatment of Hyponatremia ==
The treatment of hyponatraemia for endurance athletes depends on the severity of the condition at the time of treatment. For accurate diagnosis and treatment the amount of fluid that was consumed must be known. A higher fluid intake means there will be a lower sodium concentration (mmol/L/h serum sodium concentration). This will then result in a higher escalation of treatment required. Intraveinous drips must be avoided at all costs as they can exacerbate the problem, and this can be fatal. 

Suggested means of treatment for severely affected athletes include:
*Hypertonic Saline: Solution with a higher sodium content than the body. Amount taken depends on individual characteristics and degree of hyponatremia. (7)
*Loop Diuretics: Loop diuretics act upon the ascending loop of Henle in the kidneys nephron to inhibit sodium reabsorption. Thus, more sodium is kept for use of the cells. (8)
*Mannitol: Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic as well as a renal vasodilator. It prevents the reabsorption of sodium and swells the kidneys with fluids with the aim of expelling fluids quicker. (9)

Just a ping about the earlier request.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 09:26, 31 October 2011 (UTC)
: Finished :), I ran my current uk-us list, double spaces, and contractions. [[User:Hethrir|Hethrir]] ([[User talk:Hethrir|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Hethrir|contribs]]) 19:41, 31 October 2011 (UTC)
::Needs rewikify also...   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 20:28, 31 October 2011 (UTC)
:: Rewikifyed, after a few changes to the script. Do you want it to remove references also? [[User:Hethrir|Hethrir]] ([[User talk:Hethrir|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Hethrir|contribs]])
:::I think the number is very small, one or two, you can use it as a test to the script if you like if not I will take care of them later.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 01:38, 1 November 2011 (UTC)
:::Removed citations, and did a few updates on the script to make it more efficient. [[User:Hethrir|Hethrir]] ([[User talk:Hethrir|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Hethrir|contribs]]) 19:10, 1 November 2011 (UTC)

:::Note the last edit &lt;nowiki&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriented_strand_board (OSB)]&lt;/nowiki&gt; detected as a reference and removed, could have been restructured during rewikification (turned into a wikilink) or even smarter offered as an option to the local operator (you) as a rewikification for the previous words. Less complex that what &lt;s&gt;than&lt;/s&gt; it seems, it should only required an identification of en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ as a wikipedia link to execute a removal with the Oriented strand board (OSB), as the primary option for substitution and as an alternative the last word or an offer for a range.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 19:14, 1 November 2011 (UTC)

::::I prefer to keep relevant web links visible in the text (for portability of the content), I rarely use non-wiki links in my content.

== Another great function to add ==
A fix for broken Wikipedia links. Often imports are dewikified because fixing them is extremely time consuming, but this permits a loss of usefulness of the text and cuts one of the connections that is of mutual benefit to the projects. If a bot is able to fix the broken links it would probably be of a great help and an incentive for people to request the import in place of doing sporadic copy paste even when using an attribution (I have a planed book project about the [[w:Templars|Templars]] and having that capability would be extremely useful).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 02:09, 7 October 2011 (UTC)
:By fix you mean it would change red links to text, or link to the wikipedia page? [[User:Hethrir|Hethrir]] ([[User talk:Hethrir|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Hethrir|contribs]]) 02:15, 7 October 2011 (UTC)
::Correct the link to the proper Wikipedia page. In the imported pages this function is easier to implement (since links will not have local pages in consideration and most of them will have a good target at Wikipedia). Fixing red links outside of the import page is harder, it would require examining if the page exist locally and if not then verify if the page exists at Wikipedia also a deeper examination of the link is necessary for instance the existence of a / will definitely indicate that the red link is local and intentional.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 02:49, 7 October 2011 (UTC)

:::: It is ignoring the ones with alternate text (like [ [ URL_to_Text | Text ] ]), but I will fix that soon. Right now it checks if the link exists locally, then checks Wikipedia if it can't find it, what do you want it to do if it can't find something on Wikipedia or Wikibooks? [[User:Hethrir|Hethrir]] ([[User talk:Hethrir|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Hethrir|contribs]]) 22:37, 8 October 2011 (UTC)

::::: Citation needed tags should also be removes. Wikibooks doesn't require adding citations. One other thing that would be interesting is dealing with references, in that regard I have no solution only the realization that wikipedia articles are sometimes too thick with references, most times if I'm using that content I remove most of them, only leaving resources that are available online (like pdf documents) adding something like (see &lt;nowiki&gt;[url description, author and date]&lt;/nowiki&gt;) at the end of the phrase that relates to the text.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 12:52, 9 October 2011 (UTC)

::::: This script is near finish, except for the references thing, which I am still going to do, but haven't yet started. It took a little while due to a few frustrations (I thought about re-writing the framework in c++), but I can have it edit any pages you want. Here is the result:

Another idea, can you create and give access for edit to others (by sticking a note there) a page with pages that the boot will continuously monitor, the requesting editor for that monitoring and the preferences that the editor selected for those pages. This would be useful for you and to avoid confusions, it can even be extended in an automated way within the bot at a later time. This would best be set on the bot page, since people will look there first and at a later time in case you decide to stop running the bot, enable others to continue the operation using the same account.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 22:34, 24 October 2011 (UTC)

== Thoughts ==

Adding spaces in a heading is fairly pointless and shouldn't be done; while the bot lacks a flag it clutters up recent changes.

Additionally, I don't understand why you've been creating orphaned redirects to pages with the redirect using lowercase first letters of a subpage (such as Japanese/kana/lessons/hiragana/lesson 3 to [[Japanese/Kana/Lessons/Hiragana/Lesson 3]]); convention is normally to capitalize, but sometimes book authors use lowercase.  I can see maybe the reverse if they were using lowercase since it's less common, but it's still not necessary. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 19:58, 3 October 2011 (UTC)

:Edit conflict - I think this should be stopped. The redirects are orphaned and therefore speedy deletable. This should be for community agreement because at the moment we are seeing RC flooded and hundreds of pages needing re-review for a cosmetic change that is of no value &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 20:01, 3 October 2011 (UTC)

:::You may wish to discuss a bot flag at [[WB:RFP]].  We could at the least add the reviewer flag if the edits appear to be good.  While the spaces in the headings or adding spaces after the * in a list are just too insignificant, some of the changes, like Image -&gt; File, and fixing links with underscores or that had an unnecessary pipe, or replacing HTML entities were decent enough.  But we should first go over what the bot could do and what it actually ''should'' do.

:I very much would support giving this bot the bot flag.  I normally choose to see bot activity in RC when I patrol anyhow, so it's not as if this would be hidden.  But it sure would be nice to be able to hide these edits from RC.  The flooding there makes it almost impossible to patrol for vandalism.  I view granting the bot flag and agreeing on the bot's activities as two separate things.

::I'm not a zealot but it kinda of irks me, mostly because of the lack of consistency and as editor I read a lot of the text in edit mode. I had never noticed this issue before getting active on Wikibooks and I notice that the practice on Wikibooks is escalating. The article I added was the first one I saw that reflected all the reasons I think are valid to avoid doing so (but it is generally accepted as a bad practice). I never use two spaces and never did, I could agree that it makes the period more distinguishable but the function of the period is already safeguarded by itself and the capitalization of the next letter, so even that is a bad excuse.
::Can you explain me the advantage of the two spaces for you Adrignola ?
::In any case if we are focusing in writing books to be printed we should fallow the rules of typography.

::::Two spaces after a full stop (or ''period'', if you prefer) is standard.  I always do it and I really hope we're not going to have a bot fix such things.  Panic, why are you asking for contractions and UK English to be removed?  That's entirely up to the authors of the book and contractions, especially on the Internet, are perfectly fine.  OK, I realise that you are now removing contractions in books that Panic has authored but what about all the other editors in those books?  I don't see what benefit this bot is having for Wikibooks.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:06, 6 October 2011 (UTC)
:::::Two spaces aren't standard (see for instance the Wikipedia article about it), or just read what we have said above about it. The English-US is adopted as a convention on most books I work, as is the use of the hyphenation (as a preference and what should be used not as a forced requirement) and the avoidance of contractions is just indisputable good writing practice (I agree with you than in talk pages and informal context they are fine). --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 12:15, 6 October 2011 (UTC)
::::::A Wikipedia article about double spacing is not proof that it is not standard.  The English language has no authority governing what is considered to be correct usage of the language (unlike most other languages).  Again, it is up to the preference of the authors.  I accept that you are the principal author of the Video Games book so you can do as you please but this bot should be restricted to those books only if it is going to alter contractions or styles of English.  I have been a lecturer in English for many years (generally to students whose first language isn't English) and I have always told students to use contractions expect for the most formal of situations.

== Fixing contractions ==

Why is this box fixing contractions (eg. don't -&gt; do not) in books?  There is no policy about using full forms as opposed to contractions and if a book's authors wants to use contractions then that is fine.  Please don't fix such &quot;mistakes&quot; unless the author of the book has requested it.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:01, 6 October 2011 (UTC)

:The bot run was requested Xania, by one of the book authors (me, see talk above). In any case contractions have no place in written form if not used expressly to replicate a voice conversation/dialog. I wouldn't advocate using the bot only for that purpose, but as part of other tasks I don't see it as an issue even if not requested by one of the authors but by anyone with lets say review rights that can be held responsible for monitoring the changes.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 12:06, 6 October 2011 (UTC)

:Contractions have no place in written form?  Maybe in a formal business letter or a thesis but in a book they certainly do.  You are free to request such changes to books where you are the primary author or books where you have sought the approval of other authors but this can not be used randomly on any book.  --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:13, 6 October 2011 (UTC)

::That was the point of the discussion and even the request for the attribution of the bot flag. We are in agreement, the bot should only be used by request.
::Anyway can you please point me a good book that isn't attempting to replicate a dialog that uses contractions ? Or any article/paper/someone of authority that supports that view ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 12:18, 6 October 2011 (UTC)
:::I could ask you to do the same.  It's all just about style like most other things in English.  There is no rule.  --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:25, 6 October 2011 (UTC)
::::It common practice, that creates the rule, in fact there are several types of contractions what the bot is focusing and we have been speaking is the use of informal contractions, by their own definition are to be only used in informal circumstances (no problem with it). Do a search on the web and see what most people agree with. In any simply looking to the phrase &quot;Contractions are used sparingly in formal written English. The APA style guide prefers that contractions, including Latin abbreviations, not be used in scholarly papers, and recommends that the equivalent phrase in English be written out.&quot; at [[w:Contraction (grammar)]] resumes the practice well. In fact writing things out clearly permits better comprehension mostly the same rational behind using hyphenation. In any case being all things equal there was no reason for the reversal of the contractions you did, the validity would be null but not objectionable.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 12:46, 6 October 2011 (UTC)
::::: I reversed the contractions because, at that time, I didn't believe that they had been requested and because they didn't add anything to the books in question.  I now see that they were requested so there is no problem there.  If someone was going around and changing US to UK English (or vice-versa) without consent then I would have done the same thing because such changes are not adding anything to the book.  One problem with &quot;writing things out clearly&quot; can be that it adds stress to a sentence where no stress is intended (saying &quot;I can't play the guitar&quot; is weaker than saying &quot;I cannot play the guitar&quot; and can imply that we are emphasising that you can't do it).  There is a difference between scholarly papers and a Wikibook and language styles are freer on the Internet than in printed material.  As I said before, what you do with YOUR (where you're primary editor) book is up to you.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 13:04, 6 October 2011 (UTC)
:::::: I have before converted some English-US to English_UK and vice versa without any extended consensus, based on what was more prominent on the work, I have not ever reverted any similar changes nor contested them, because as you said nothing was added or removed from the works, therefore I don't see reversing those types of changes a good practice. In the example you used the first person is used and I agree with you but rarely one sees books that format or even &quot;me&quot;, &quot;she&quot; or &quot;he&quot;, most that do are language books and I think that using this bot feature there is problematic because it would alter example phrases especially when reflecting common dialogs, or for instance works that uses lots of quotes can also be problematic, for instance in the P2P work I have included some quotes, special consideration must be used there.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 13:20, 6 October 2011 (UTC)
::::::: OK, my example wasn't great and such differences are mainly reserved to spoken English.  I certainly wouldn't allow this bot anywhere near a language book because students are generally always told to use contractions.  I have no issues provided that the editors of the books are in support of the changes.  Don't really care either way - I regularly use Americanisms like ''canceled'' and ''customize'' but would never think of writing ''encyclopedia'', ''color'' or ''fetus'' (which I thought was a typo when I saw it recently in a Wikibook.  Do we really need a bot to do these tasks?  My browser underlines any typos automatically and will correct them if I set that option and a find-replace on a certain page is easy enough to do.
:::::::: Yes the bot should only work on projects by request and edits must be monitored (no one has disagreed with that requirement). Not all works will be able to utilize all of the bot features (but my understanding is that they can be turned on or off as requested).
:::::::: The great benefit of having the bot provide the features is that it permits to make works more consistent. I prefer English-US (I cringe overtime I see &quot;colour&quot; in English, I have come to have an instinctive dislike for the written French language due probably to have been forced to learn it) but often will edit Americanisms out of works that are predominantly English-UK, so I agree that to each its own, if no one objects with reason I also don't see an issue, so after all considerations we expressed we seem to be basically in agreement.
:::::::: The bot can presumably be made to work the other way around, as to remove Americanisms and probably extended in other ways. I appreciate the work made by Hethrir and the effort to make it conform to our needs and requirements.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 01:46, 7 October 2011 (UTC)

:::::::: The bot can be used change US English to UK English, I'm currently working on that right now, both contractions and the two spaces after periods, exclamation marks, and question marks are finished.

# Flammable materials should be stored in a separate cabinet or a room depending on the size.
# Make sure to separate oxidizing agents from reducing agents.
# Liquids should be stored in double container in case the container breaks

==Hypertension Background==
Blood pressure is a measure of the force arteries are subjected to by the heart pumping blood around the body. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension Hypertension], high blood pressure, is defined by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare as blood pressure at or above 140/90.&lt;ref&gt;A.D.A.M Medical Encyclopaedia, &quot;''Hypertension''&quot;, Pub Med Health, viewed 24th september 2011. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001502/ &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AIHW&quot; &gt;Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, &quot;''High Blood Pressure''&quot;, Australian Federal Government, Viewed 30th September 2011. http://www.aihw.gov.au/high-blood-pressure/&lt;/ref&gt; The main risk factors for hypertension are alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, high dietary salt intake and being overweight.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIHW&quot; /&gt; Tobacco smoke increases the risk of adverse health outcomes in hypertensive people.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIHW&quot; /&gt; Hypertension is the most common cardiovascular condition in Australia; 11% or 2.1 million of the Australian population in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics, &quot;''4821.0.55.001 - Cardiovascular Disease in Australia: A Snapshot, 2004-05''&quot;, Australian Federal Government, Viewed 30th of September 2011. http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/4821.0.55.001&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Lifestyle Changes to Reduce Blood Pressure===
There are a number of lifestyle measures effective in reducing hypertension.
* Diet: reducing intake of fats, red meat, sugar and sodium. &lt;ref name=&quot;AIHW&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whelton, P, et al, &quot;''Primary Prevention of Hypertension - Clinical and public Health Advisory from the National High Blood Pressure Education Program''&quot;, American Medical Association, Viewed 21st of September 2011. http://pedneph.info/NewFiles/HBP/hbp%20adobe%20articles/Primary%20prevention%20of%20hypertension.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exercise
* Weight Reduction&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, V, et al, &quot;''Weight Loss Intervention in Phase 1 of the Trials of Hypertension Prevention&quot; Archives of Internal Medicine'', Viewed 2nd of October 2011. http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/153/7/849&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;He, J, &quot;''Long-Term Effects of Weight Loss and Dietary Sodium Reduction on Incidence of Hypertension''&quot;, American Heart Association, viewed 18th of October 2011.http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/35/2/544.full&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Resistance Training Benefits==
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_training Resistance training], also known as weight training or strength training, increases muscle strength, endurance and power.&lt;ref name=&quot;HC&quot; &gt;Better Health Channel, &quot;''Resistance training -Beginners''&quot;, Victorian Government, Viewed 3rd of October 2011. http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/resistance_training?open&lt;/ref&gt; Resistance training has many health benefits:&lt;ref&gt;American Heart Foundation, &quot;''Resistance Exercise in Individuals With and Without Cardiovascular Disease : Benefits, Rationale, Safety, and Prescription - An Advisory From the Committee on Exercise, Rehabilitation, and Prevention, Council on Clinical Cardiology''&quot; American Heart Foundation, Viewed 10th of October 2011. http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/101/7/828/T1.expansion.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;HC&quot; /&gt;
* Decreases body fat percentage
* Increases lean body mass
* Decreases diastolic blood pressure
* Increases [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max]
* Increases basal Metabolism
Resistance training has been shown to lower blood pressure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sorace&quot; &gt;Sorace, P, et al, &quot;''Hypertension and Resistance Training''&quot;, Strength and Conditioning Journal, viewed 5th of October 2011.http://www.cross-fitllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Hypertension-and-Resistance-Training.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fagard, R, &quot;''Effects of Endurance Training on Blood Pressure, Blood Pressure–Regulating Mechanisms, and Cardiovascular Risk Factors''&quot;, American Heart Association, viewed 15th of October 2011.http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/46/4/667.full&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Resistance Training Recommendations===
Those with blood pressure outside the values of 90/60-160/110 should consult a doctor before commencing resistance training.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sorace&quot; /&gt; 

It is recommended that resistance training be incorporated into an exercise program including aerobic exercise and flexibility; the recommendations are: &lt;ref&gt;&quot;''ACSM’s guidelines for exercise testing and prescription''&quot;, 2009, American College of Sports Medicine, Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hypertension/High Blood Pressure Health Center, &quot;''Exercise Tips for Those With High Blood Pressure''.  http://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/guide/safe-exercise-tips&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise, &quot;''Physical activity in the prevention and treatment of hypertension''&quot;. Vol, 31. No, 11. P, s624, Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2-3 sets
* 8-12 repetitions within each set
* 2 sessions per week
* 8-10 exercises within the session
* No above head exercises should be performed; the associated increase in blood pressure with these exercises may be harmful
* No &quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum one repetition maximum]&quot; lifting
* Weight range of lifting is to be between 40-60% of one repetition maximum

      <text xml:space="preserve"># Upon entering, put your personal belongings in the designated area. If no such area exists, put them under your desk or in a corner so no one trips by accident.
# Note the locations of exit doors, telephones, shower/eyewash, the first aid, spill kits, fire extinguishers, and fire blanket.
# Wear your protective equipments immediately if someone else have already started working or if you are near hazardous chemicals.
# Check the MSDS again for all the chemicals that you will be using that day.

'''atexit''' (at exit) is a [[Function (computer science)|function]] that is in the [[C Programming Language]] to register the given ''function'' to be executed at normal process termination, either via [[Exit (operating system)|exit]] or via [[Return statement|return]] from the program's [[main function]].

The &lt;code&gt;atexit&lt;/code&gt; function takes, as argument, the [[reference]] of the function to be registered for [[Callback (computer programming)|call back]]. Functions so registered are called in the reverse order of their registration; no arguments are passed.

==POSIX Usage==
The &lt;code&gt;atexit&lt;/code&gt; function is standardized by the [[POSIX]] specification.

The prototype of the function is as below:
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;int atexit(void (*function)(void));&lt;/source&gt;

The function returns zero (0) if it completed execution successfully. Non-zero return values signify an error.

POSIX requires that an implementation of &lt;code&gt;atexit&lt;/code&gt; allow at least ATEXIT_MAX (32) such functions to be registered.

==Example==
The following example demonstrates the use of the &lt;code&gt;atexit&lt;/code&gt; function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
void end(void) {
        printf(&quot;[ DONE ]\n&quot;);
}
int main(){
        long ret;
        ret = sysconf(_SC_ATEXIT_MAX);
        printf(&quot;ATEXIT_MAX = %ld\n&quot;, ret);
        if( atexit(end) != 0 ) {
                perror(&quot;Unable to set exit function\n&quot;);
                return EXIT_FAILURE;
        }
        printf( &quot;About to quit... &quot; );
        return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

{{merge to|C string|discuss=Talk:C_standard_library#Pages_for_each_function_and_WP:NOTMANUAL|date=October 2011}}
'''atoi''' is a function in the [[C programming language]] that converts a string into an integer numerical representation. &lt;code&gt;atoi&lt;/code&gt; stands for ''[[ASCII]] to integer''. It is included in the [[C standard library]] [[header file]] &lt;code&gt;[[stdlib.h]]&lt;/code&gt;. Its prototype is as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int atoi(const char *str);
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt; argument is a string, represented by an array of characters, containing the characters of a signed integer number. The string must be null-terminated. When atoi encounters a string with no numerical sequence, it returns zero (0).

There are several variants of the '''atoi''' function, '''atol''', '''[[atof]]''' and '''atoll''' , which are used to convert a string into a &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; type, respectively.  The '''atoll''' was formerly known as '''atoq''' and was included into [[C99]].

==Deficiencies==
It is impossible to tell whether the string holds valid sequence of digits that represents the number 0 or invalid number as the function returns 0 in both cases. The newer function [[strtol]] does not have this deficiency.

'''atoi''' is neither [[thread-safe]], nor [[Asynchronous I/O|async-cancel safe]] on some operating systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;codecogs_atoi&quot;&gt;http://www.codecogs.com/reference/c/stdlib.h/atoi.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, '''atoi''' only converts base ten ascii values (this may also be a benefit depending on perspective).  [[strtol]] and other functions support alternate bases such as hexadecimal and octal.

==Standards conformance==

The '''atoi''', [[atof]], and '''atol''' functions are a part of the ISO standard C library ([[C89 (C version)|C89]]), while the '''atoll''' function is added by [[C99]].

However, because of the ambiguity in returning 0 and lack of [[thread-safe]]ty and [[Asynchronous I/O|async-cancel safe]]ty  on some operating systems, atoi is considered to be [[deprecation|deprecated]] by [[strtol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;codecogs_atoi&quot;/&gt;

In the [[C Programming/C Reference|C standard library]], '''bsearch''' is a function used to search for an object in a sorted array using the [[Algorithm Implementation/Search/Binary search|binary search algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | url=http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf 
 | title=ISO/IEC 9899:1999 specification
 | at=p. 318, § 7.20.5.1
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

bsearch is a generic function that can search in sorted arrays of any size, containing any kind of object, or pointer to object, and using any kind of comparison predicate. The genericity, however, comes at the expense of type-safety, since bsearch operates on void pointers; and is also expensive in the number of function calls (since each comparison requires a call to the comparison predicate), which have a large overhead.

==Prototype==
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
void *bsearch(const void *key, const void *base, size_t nmemb, size_t size,
              int (*compare)(const void *, const void *));
// notice nmemb before size, unlike fread and fwrite
&lt;/source&gt;

== Behaviour ==
The bsearch() function returns a pointer to a matching member of the array, or NULL if no match is found. If the array has multiple matching elements the return value will be a pointer to one of those elements. Which particular element is unspecified.&lt;ref&gt;UNIX man pages:&lt;code&gt;man 3 bsearch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''CARG''' is basically a standard library function(complex function) which calculates the argument of complex number. It passes a numeric or logical argument by value. It returns phase angle of complex number(a+bi) in polar form within the range [π,-π]. 

==Description==
This function passes a numeric or logical argument by value instead of using the Fortran standard of passing arguments by reference. When the argument is of type, ''character'' at that time the CARG function will convert the argument to a C string. It can only be used as an actual argument when invoking a subroutine or function.
A complex number can be represented as:
* &lt;math&gt;Z = A + Bi&lt;/math&gt; (in rectangular co-ordinates)
where 'A' is real part and 'B' is an imaginary part.
*&lt;math&gt;z = re^{ia}&lt;/math&gt; (in polar co-ordinates)
where r = cabs(z) is the radius and a = carg(z) is the phase angle. Hence this function returns phase angle of complex number Z when it is used in polar co-ordinates the return value is ranges from [π, -π] and when we use this function, we required to use ''&lt;complex.h&gt;'' header file.

In general, this function calculates argument of a complex number.&lt;br /&gt;

==Synopsis==
'''#include'''&lt;complex.h&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
double carg (double complex z);&lt;br /&gt;
float cargf (float complex z);&lt;br /&gt;
long double cargl (long double complex z);&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4Mfe4sAMFUYC&amp;pg=PT304&amp;lpg=PT304&amp;dq=carg+function+c&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tPLOVrJ7ph&amp;sig=UKMDwS0su_1ZT5pbAc5pE-MJh9Q&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=oopxTq7dDcfirAeJxJ2eBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=carg%20function%20c&amp;f=false carg function]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SYNTAX'''

Syntax of this carg function is as follow:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|      SYNTAX
|-
|      carg (item)
|}

In this, 'item' may be of any intrinsic type except ''complex'' &amp; ''4 byte logical''.It is a data object for which to return a value.

==Result==
When the argument is numerical or logical, at that time value of item is placed on calling stack, rather than its address. If argument is of the type ''character'', the fortran length descriptor is removed and the character string is null terminated.
The C data type of the result is shown in following table:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! '''fortran type''' !! '''fortran kind''' !! '''c type'''
|-
| ''Integer'' || 1 || signed char
|-
| ''Integer'' || 2 || signed short int
|-
| ''Integer'' || 4 || signed long int
|-
| ''Real'' || 4 || float
|-
| ''Complex'' || 4 || should not be passed by value; if passed by reference (without CARG) then it is pointer to a strcture
|-
| ''logical'' || 1 || unsigned char
|-
| ''logical'' || 4 || must not be passed by value or by reference
|-
| ''char'' || 1 || char*
|-
|}


==Example 1==
  /*conversion of a real number from its Cartesian to polar form*/
 &lt;br /&gt;
 #include&lt;stdio.h&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 #include&lt;complex.h&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 int main(){&lt;br /&gt;
 double complex z = -4.4 + 3.3 * I;&lt;br /&gt;
 double radius = cabs(z);&lt;br /&gt;
 double argument = carg(z);&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 double x = creal(z);&lt;br /&gt;
 double y = cimag(z);&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 printf(&quot;cartesian(x,y):(%4.1f,%4.1f)\n&quot;,x,y);&lt;/br&gt;
 printf(&quot;polar(r,theta):(%4.1f,%4.1f)\n&quot;,radius,argument);&lt;br /&gt;
 return 0;&lt;br /&gt;
 }



===Output===
 Cartesian(x,y):(-4.4,3.3)&lt;br /&gt;
 polar(r,theta):(5.5,2.5)&lt;ref&gt;[http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/c/0596006977/standard-library-functions/cinanut-chp-17-23 C in a Nutshell:carg]&lt;/ref&gt;

   USE CARG_INT
   USE UMACH_INT

   Z = (1.0,1.0)
   VALUE=CARG(Z)

{{lowercase|title=casinh(C)}}
&lt;code&gt;casinh&lt;/code&gt; is one of the Standard C library functions in the [[C Programming/C Reference/complex.h|complex.h]] header file. It is used to calculate the complex and inverse hyperbolic sine of given angle or number. Just like sine operator has inverse as sin inverse, hyperbolic sine of complex number has this as an inverse function.

The prototype of this function is:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;double complex casinh(double complex x);
&lt;/source&gt;
if casinh(x) = y, then x = csinh(y).
It can be also evaluated as:
casinh(x) = clog(x+csqrt(x*x+1))

== return value ==
This function returns complex arc hyperbolic sine,in the range mathematically unbounded along real axis and in the interval &lt;math&gt;[-i\pi/2,+i\pi/2]&lt;/math&gt; along imaginary axis.

== compatibility ==

The C library provides with the &lt;code&gt;ccos&lt;/code&gt; function which gives the cosine of a complex number.It is included in the header file [[C Programming/C Reference/complex.h|complex.h]]. This function returns a double-precision floating point number.&lt;br /&gt;
The ccos function can be expressed as:&lt;br /&gt;

ccosz = (exp (i * z)  + exp (-i * z))/2&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://linux.die.net/man/3/ccos ccos(3) - Linux man page]&quot;. die.net. Retrieved 20 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''cimag''' is a complex function in c programming.  As complex numbers contain two parts, one real part and one imaginary part, this function is used to declare the imaginary part of a complex number.  For example, let 'M' be any complex number which can be represented using c functions as follows:
:M = creal(M) + cimag(M) * i
:where creal(M) = real part of M.
:The function returns the imaginary part of the complex no.

'''feof''' is a [[C (programming language)|C]] [[C standard library|standard library]] [[Subroutine|function]] declared in the header [[stdio.h]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | url=http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf 
 | title=ISO/IEC 9899:1999 specification
 | at=p. 305, § 7.19.10.2
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary purpose is to distinguish between cases where a stream operation has reached the end of a file and cases where the &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; (&quot;end of file&quot;) error code has been returned as a generic error indicator, without the end of the file's actually having been reached.

==Function prototype==
The function is declared as follows:
:&lt;code&gt;int feof(FILE *fp);&lt;/code&gt;
It takes one argument: a pointer to the &lt;code&gt;FILE&lt;/code&gt; structure of the stream to check.

==Return value==
The return value of the function is an integer. A nonzero value signifies that the end of the file has been reached; a value of zero signifies that it has not. 

==Example code==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 
 int main()
 {
     FILE *fp = fopen(&quot;file.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;);
     int c;
     c = getc(fp);
     while (c != EOF) {
         /* Echo the file to stdout */
         putchar(c);
         c = getc(fp);
     }
     if (feof(fp))
       puts(&quot;End of file was reached.&quot;);
     else if (ferror(fp))
       puts(&quot;There was an error reading from the stream.&quot;);
     else
       /*NOTREACHED*/
       puts(&quot;getc() failed in a non-conforming way.&quot;);
 
     fclose(fp);
     return 0;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==Pitfalls==
A common misuse of the function is trying to use &lt;tt&gt;feof&lt;/tt&gt; &quot;preemptively&quot;. However, this doesn't work correctly, as &lt;tt&gt;feof&lt;/tt&gt; is only set for a descriptor ''after'' a reading function has failed.

'''fgetpos''' is a function in the [[C file input/output|I/O section]] of the [[C standard library]].

== Usage ==

:&lt;tt&gt;int fgetpos(FILE *stream, fpos_t *pos);&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;fgetpos()&lt;/tt&gt; will retrieve the file offset (in bytes) from stdio stream &lt;tt&gt;stream&lt;/tt&gt; into storage of type &lt;tt&gt;[[fpos t]]&lt;/tt&gt; pointed to by variable &lt;tt&gt;pos&lt;/tt&gt;, which should be allocated by the caller. This variable should only be used for subsequent calls to &lt;tt&gt;fsetpos()&lt;/tt&gt;. A separate function, &lt;tt&gt;[[ftell()]]&lt;/tt&gt; can be used instead in order to retrieve the value of the file offset as a long integer.

The return value is 0 on successful completion, or -1 on error (in which case &lt;tt&gt;errno&lt;/tt&gt; is set accordingly).

==frexp()==
We used frexp() in mathematical purpose.The frexp() is function which break the floating point value into two part. First in mantissa and second in exponent.We can express x as floating point value, m as mantissa and n as exponent. In frexp(), the range of mantissa is always between 0.5 to 1.

==Format==
:double frexp(double x, int *exppr);
:float frexpf(float x, int *exppr);
:long double frexp1(long double x, int *exppr);

==Return value==
The frexp() function return mantissa.The exppr pointed to the location where exponent is stored. x=mantissa*2exponent

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;tt&gt;''fwprintf''&lt;/tt&gt; is a [[C standard library]] function as defined in [[wchar.h]]. The required headers are whar.h and stdio.h. It is the wide character version of [[fprintf]]. It's function signature is
 '''int fwprintf(FILE *fp, const [[wchar_t]] *format, argument list);'''
In signature of the fwprintf, ''fp'' is a stream to which you want to send output.
''format'' is wide character stream that specifies the format of output.The formatting string takes care of additional arguments you need to provide.

==Usage==
fwprintf puts output on the named output stream. 
fwprintf performs wide character output to stream and this stream is not byte oriented
The fwprintf is the function which converts all the arguments specified in the argument list in accordance with wide character format specifier in format.The fwprintf() function writes output to the stream ,under control of the wide string pointed to by ''format''.

==Format==
fwprintf() function can convert, print and format its arguments in the parenthesis which converts the format wide characters string. 
Here the format consists of either ''numbered argument specifications'' such as &quot;%n$&quot;and &quot;*m$&quot; or ''unnumbered arguments conversion specifiers'' such as % and *.But both cannot be. 
 
==Return==
fwprintf returns the number of wide characters used excluding the NULL character. If an error occurs ,it returns a negative number.

{{lowercase|ldexp}}
{{lowercase|ldexpf}}
{{lowercase|ldexpl}}
In [[computing]], '''ldexp''' is a function that multiplies a double precision floating point value by a specified integral power of two, returning the result if it is a valid floating point value for the representation used for double precision floating point values in the execution environment.

==Location==
It is one of the [[C programming language]]'s math library routines and is declared in the header file [[math.h]].

==Definition==
The function ldexp is defined in the [[C programming language]] standard, [[ISO/IEC 9899]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/standards.html ISO/IEC 9899 Standard for the C Programming Language]&lt;/ref&gt; as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''7.12.6.6 The ldexp functions'''&lt;br/&gt;
'''Synopsis'''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;math.h&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
double ldexp(double x, int exp);&lt;br /&gt;
double ldexpf(float x, int exp);&lt;br /&gt;
long double ldexpl(long double x, int exp);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Description'''&lt;br /&gt;
The ldexp functions multiply a floating-point number by an integral power of 2. A
range error may occur.

'''Returns'''&lt;br /&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;ldexp&lt;/code&gt; functions return &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;*2&lt;sup&gt;exp&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Open Group]] [[Single Unix Specification]] expands on the interface definition for ldexp in a [[Unix]]&lt;sup&gt;tm&lt;/sup&gt; hosted environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/ldexp.html Open Group Base Specifications Issue 6, ldexp() definition]&lt;/ref&gt;

:The Description section has the following additional information:
::An application wishing to check for error situations should set errno to zero and call feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these functions. On return, if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error has occurred.

:The &quot;Returns&quot; section is expanded with the following clauses:
:: If these functions would cause overflow, a range error must occur and &lt;code&gt;ldexp()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ldexpf()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;ldexpl()&lt;/code&gt; must return ±&lt;code&gt;HUGE_VAL&lt;/code&gt;, ±&lt;code&gt;HUGE_VALF&lt;/code&gt;, and ±&lt;code&gt;HUGE_VALL&lt;/code&gt; (according to the sign of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;), respectively.
:: If the correct value would cause underflow, and is not representable, a range error may occur, and either 0.0 (if supported), or an implementation-defined value must be returned.
:: If x is NaN, a NaN must be returned.
:: If x is ±0 or ±Inf, &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; must be returned.
:: If exp is 0, x must be returned.
:: If the correct value would cause underflow, and is representable, a range error may occur and the correct value must be returned.

:It also adds an &quot;Errors section&quot;, as follows:
::These functions must fail if:
:::Range Error
::::The result overflows.
:::::If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then errno must be set to [ERANGE]. If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the overflow floating-point exception must be raised.

==Implementation==
For binary exponent based [[floating point]] representations such as [[IEEE 754-1985|IEEE 754]], ldexp can be implemented by simply extracting the exponent from the value of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and adding &lt;code&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt; to it and if the result is within the valid exponent values for the representation, replacing &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;'s exponent with the result.  If the calculated exponent value is too high the function returns +∞ or -∞ (depending on the sign of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;), and if the value is too low, the function returns 0.0.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;
struct tm * localtime ( const time_t * ptr_time );
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Parameters:'''&lt;br /&gt;

The pointer 'ptr_time' is a pointer to a 'time_t' object that contains a calendar time.&lt;br /&gt;

'''Return Value:'''&lt;br /&gt;
The function localtime() returns a pointer to a tm structure. The tm structure contains the time information.&lt;br /&gt;

==  Explanation  ==
&lt;br /&gt;
The function localtime() uses the time pointed by the pointer ptr_time to fill a tm structure with the values that represent the corresponding local time.
If this function is called, it returns the localtime in the form &lt;br /&gt;
&quot;day Month date hr:min:sec year&quot;((Output)).

The '''ltoa''' function in the [[C programming language]] is used to convert an integer into a string.

:&lt;code&gt;char *ltoa(long integer, char *string, int radix)&lt;/code&gt;

Where &lt;code&gt;integer&lt;/code&gt; is the long integer in which a number resides, &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; is the string, represented by an array of characters and &lt;code&gt;radix&lt;/code&gt; is the [[base (exponentiation)|base number]] in which the number will be represented.

In computing, '''&lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt;''' is a subroutine for performing dynamic memory allocation.  &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; is part of the [[C standard library|standard library]] and is declared in the &lt;code&gt;[[stdlib.h]]&lt;/code&gt; header.

Many implementations of &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; are available, each of which performs differently depending on the computing hardware and how a program is written. Performance varies in both execution time and required memory. The pointer to memory allocated using malloc must eventually be passed to the &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; subroutine to deallocate the memory in order to avoid [[memory leak]]s.

==Rationale==
The C programming language manages memory statically, automatically, or dynamically. Static-duration variables are allocated in main (fixed) memory and persist for the lifetime of the program; automatic-duration variables are allocated on the stack and come and go as functions are called and return. For static-duration and, before C99 (which allows variable-length automatic arrays&lt;ref&gt;[http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Variable-Length.html gcc manual] on gnu.org accessed at December 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;), automatic-duration variables, the size of the allocation is required to be compile-time constant. If the required size is not known until run-time (for example, if data of arbitrary size is being read from the user or from a disk file), then using fixed-size data objects is inadequate.

The lifetime of allocated memory is also a concern.  Neither static- nor automatic-duration memory is adequate for all situations. Automatic-allocated data cannot persist across multiple function calls, while static data persists for the life of the program whether it is needed or not. In many situations the programmer requires greater flexibility in managing the lifetime of allocated memory.

These limitations are avoided by using [[dynamic memory allocation]] in which memory is more explicitly (but more flexibly) managed, typically, by allocating it from [[Dynamic memory allocation|the heap]], an area of memory structured for this purpose. In C, the library function &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; is used to allocate a block of memory on the heap. The program accesses this block of memory via a [[pointer (computing)|pointer]] that &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; returns.  When the memory is no longer needed, the pointer is passed to '''''&lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt;''''' which deallocates the memory so that it can be used for other purposes.

Some platforms provide library calls which allow run-time dynamic allocation from the C stack rather than the heap (e.g. Unix &lt;code&gt;alloca()&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://man.freebsd.org/alloca |title=alloca |work=Man.freebsd.org |date=2006-09-05 |accessdate=2011-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft Windows]] CRTL's &lt;code&gt;malloca()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5471dc8s.aspx &lt;code&gt;malloca()&lt;/code&gt;] page on [[MSDN]] Visual C++ Developer Center. Accessed on 12th March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;). This memory is automatically freed when the calling function ends. The need for this is lessened by changes in the [[C99]] standard, which added support for [[variable-length array]]s of block scope having sizes determined at runtime.

==Dynamic memory allocation in C==
The &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; function is one of the functions in standard C to allocate memory. Its [[function prototype]] is
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
void *malloc(size_t size);
&lt;/source&gt;
which allocates &lt;code&gt;&lt;var&gt;size&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/code&gt; bytes of memory. If the allocation succeeds, a pointer to the block of memory is returned. This pointer is guaranteed to be suitably aligned to any type (including struct and such), otherwise a [[Null pointer#Null pointer|NULL pointer]] is returned.

Memory allocated via &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; is persistent: it will continue to exist, even after the program leaves the scope which called the allocation, until the program terminates or the memory is explicitly deallocated by the programmer. This is achieved by use of the &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; subroutine. Its prototype is
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
void free(void *pointer);
&lt;/source&gt;
which releases the block of memory pointed to by &lt;code&gt;pointer&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;code&gt;pointer&lt;/code&gt; must have been previously returned by &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;calloc&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;realloc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pointer&lt;/code&gt; must not be used after it has been passed to free. In particular memory allocated via new or new[] should not be passed to free, and pointers which did not come from a malloc (e.g. stack variables) or which have already been freed must not be sent to free. It is safe to call free on a NULL pointer, which has no effect.

==Usage example==
The standard method of creating an [[Array data structure|array]] of 10 int objects:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int array[10];
&lt;/source&gt;
However, if one wishes to allocate a similar array dynamically, the following code could be used:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/* Allocate space for an array with ten elements of type
   int. */
int *ptr = (int *) malloc(10 * sizeof (int));
if (ptr == NULL) {
    /* Memory could not be allocated, the program should
       handle the error here as appropriate. */
} else {
    /* Allocation succeeded.  Do something.  */
    free(ptr);  /* We are done with the int objects, and
                   free the associated pointer. */
    ptr = NULL; /* The pointed-to-data  must not be used again,
                   unless re-assigned by using malloc
                   again. */
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; returns a null pointer to indicate that no memory is available, or that some other error occurred which prevented memory being allocated.

Since there is a possibility that a call to &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; may fail for lack of sufficient memory, it is often convenient to define a macro that invokes &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; and exits when &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; fails. A possible macro definition is:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
if(!(ptr=malloc(sizeof(int))))
{
fprintf(stderr,&quot;Insufficient memory&quot;);   /* Prints the necessary error statement. */
exit(EXIT_FAILURE);  /* Exits &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; as there is insufficient memory. */
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The macro given for this would be :
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#define MALLOC(p,s)   /*Here p &amp; s are 2 integer pointer &amp; variable respectively. */ \
if(!((p)=malloc(s))) \
{ \
fprintf(stderr,&quot;Insufficient memory&quot;);   /* Prints the necessary error statement. */ \
exit(EXIT_FAILURE);   /* Exits &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; as there is insufficient memory. */ \
}
&lt;/source&gt;
So the above basic code can be replaced with just one line as:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;MALLOC(ptr,sizeof(int));&lt;/source&gt;

A useful idiom with &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; is shown in this example:

&lt;!-- If you are about to change sizeof(*ptr) to sizeof(int), you are about to make a mistake.  Read the text carefully first. --&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;int *ptr = malloc(10 * sizeof(*ptr));&lt;/source&gt;&lt;!-- If you are about to change sizeof(*ptr) to sizeof(int), you are about to make a mistake.  Read the text carefully first. --&gt;

That is, instead of writing a hard-wired type into the argument to malloc, one
uses the &lt;code&gt;sizeof&lt;/code&gt; operator on the content of the pointer to be allocated.
This ensures that the types on the left and right of the assignment will never get
out of sync when code is revised.

'C' function for creating &amp; returning a two dimensional array of size of m*n
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
      int **create(int m, n)
      {
          int **p, i;
          p = (int **)malloc(m*sizeof(int*));/* this will store base order of all the row in p */
          for(i = 0; i &lt; m; i++)
               p[i] = (int *)malloc(n*sizeof(int));/* this will create m row of n elements */
          return p;
      }
&lt;/source&gt;

==Casting and type safety==

&lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; returns a [[void pointer]] (&lt;code&gt;void *&lt;/code&gt;), which indicates that it is a pointer to a region of unknown data type. The lack of a specific pointer type returned from &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; is type-unsafe behaviour: &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; allocates based on byte count but not on type. This distinguishes it from the [[new (C++)|C++ new operator]] that returns a pointer whose type relies on the operand. (see [[Type safety#C|C Type Safety]]).

One may &quot;cast&quot; (see [[type conversion]]) this pointer to a specific type:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int *ptr;
ptr = malloc(10 * sizeof (*ptr)); // Without a cast
ptr = (int*)malloc(10 * sizeof (int)); // With a cast
&lt;/source&gt;

There are advantages and disadvantages to performing such a cast.

===Advantages to casting===
* Including the cast allows for compatibility with C++, which does require the cast to be made.
* If the cast is present and the type of the left-hand-side pointer is subsequently changed, a warning will be generated to help the programmer in correcting behaviour that otherwise could become erroneous.
* The cast allows for older versions of &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; that originally returned a &lt;code&gt;char *&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cprog_malloc&quot;&gt;[http://faq.cprogramming.com/cgi-bin/smartfaq.cgi?id=1043284351&amp;answer=1047673478 FAQ  &gt; Explanations of...  &gt; Casting malloc] on Cprogramming.com accessed at March 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages to casting===

* Under the ANSI C standard, the cast is redundant.
* Adding the cast may mask failure to include the header &lt;code&gt;stdlib.h&lt;/code&gt;, in which the prototype for &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; is found.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cprog_malloc&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c-faq.com/malloc/mallocnocast.html comp.lang.c FAQ list · Question 7.7b] on C-FAQ accessed at March 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of a prototype for &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt;, the standard requires that the C compiler assume &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; returns an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;. If there is no cast, a warning is issued when this integer is assigned to the pointer; however, with the cast, this warning is not produced, hiding a bug.  On certain architectures and data models (such as LP64 on 64-bit systems, where &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; and pointers are 64-bit and &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; is 32-bit), this error can actually result in undefined behaviour, as the implicitly declared &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; returns a 32-bit value whereas the actually defined function returns a 64-bit value. Depending on calling conventions and memory layout, this may result in stack smashing. This issue is not present in modern compilers, as they uniformly produce warnings that an undeclared function has been used, so a warning will still appear. For example, gcc's default behaviour is to show a warning that reads &quot;incompatible implicit declaration of built-in function&quot; regardless of whether the cast is present or not.

==Related functions==
===calloc===
&lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; returns a block of memory that is allocated for the programmer to use, but is uninitialized. The memory is usually initialized by hand if necessary&amp;mdash;either via the '''&lt;code&gt;memset&lt;/code&gt;''' function, or by one or more assignment statements that dereference the pointer. An alternative is to use the '''&lt;code&gt;calloc&lt;/code&gt;''' function, which allocates contiguous memory and then initializes it to zero. Its prototype is
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
void *calloc(size_t nelements, size_t elementSize);
&lt;/source&gt;
which allocates a region of memory, initialized to 0, of size &lt;code&gt;nelements&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;elementSize&lt;/code&gt;.
This can be useful when allocating an array of characters to hold a string as in the example below:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char *word = calloc(200, sizeof(char));
&lt;/source&gt;

===realloc===
It is often useful to be able to shrink or enlarge a block of memory. This can be done using &lt;code&gt;realloc&lt;/code&gt; which returns a pointer to a memory region of the specified size, which contains the same data as the old region pointed to by &lt;code&gt;pointer&lt;/code&gt; (truncated to the minimum of the old and new sizes). If &lt;code&gt;realloc&lt;/code&gt; is unable to resize the memory region in place, it allocates new storage, copies the required data, and frees the old pointer. If this allocation fails, &lt;code&gt;realloc&lt;/code&gt; maintains the original pointer unaltered, and returns the null pointer value. In case of expansion, the new region of memory outside the old data that is copied is uninitialized (contents are not predictable). The function prototype is
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
void *realloc(void *pointer, size_t size);
&lt;/source&gt;
If &lt;code&gt;pointer&lt;/code&gt; is NULL then realloc behaves like malloc of the given &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
void *p = malloc(42);
void *p = realloc(NULL, 42); /* equivalent */
&lt;/source&gt;
In both C89 and C99, &lt;code&gt;realloc&lt;/code&gt; with length 0 is a special case.  The C89 standard explicitly states that the pointer given is freed, and that the return is either a null pointer or a pointer to the newly allocated space.  The C99 standard says that the behavior is implementation-deﬁned. It's possible that malloc and realloc with size 0 return different (null and non-null) pointers. Other standards, such as the Open Group's UNIX standards, make it implementation defined whether &lt;code&gt;realloc(p, 0)&lt;/code&gt; frees &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; without allocating new space, or possibly frees &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; and returns a valid pointer to at least zero bytes of memory.
Under all standards, NULL can be returned on memory allocation failure.
When using &lt;code&gt;realloc&lt;/code&gt;, one should always use a temporary
variable.  For example
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
void *p = malloc(orig_size);
/* and later... */
void *tmp = realloc(p, big_size);
if (tmp != NULL) {
   p = tmp; /* OK, assign new, larger storage to p */
} else {
   /* handle the problem somehow */
}
&lt;/source&gt;
If instead one did
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
void *p = malloc(orig_size);
/* and later... */
p = realloc(p, big_size);
&lt;/source&gt;
and if it is not possible to obtain &lt;code&gt;big_size&lt;/code&gt; bytes of
memory, then p will have value NULL and we no longer have a pointer to the memory
previously allocated for p, creating a memory leak (see below).

==Common errors==
The improper use of &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; and related functions can frequently be a source of bugs.

===Allocation failure===
&lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; is not guaranteed to succeed&amp;mdash;if there is no memory available, or if the program has exceeded the amount of memory it is allowed to reference, &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; will return a null pointer, which should always be checked for after allocation. Many badly coded programs do not check for &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; failure. Such a program would attempt to use the null pointer returned by &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; as if it pointed to allocated memory. Most likely the program will crash; in some environments, particularly older or smaller platforms that perform no [[Virtual memory|virtual memory management]], zero is a valid address so the problem will not be caught.

===Memory leaks===
When a call to &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;calloc&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;realloc&lt;/code&gt; succeeds, the returned pointer to the allocated memory should eventually be passed to the &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; function. This releases the allocated memory, allowing it to be reused to satisfy other memory allocation requests. If this is not done, the allocated memory will not be released until the process exits (and in some environments, not even then)&amp;mdash;in other words, a [[memory leak]] will occur. Typically, memory leaks are caused by losing track of pointers, for example not using a temporary pointer for the return value of &lt;code&gt;realloc&lt;/code&gt;, which may lead to the original pointer being overwritten with a null pointer, for example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
void *ptr;
size_t size = BUFSIZ;

ptr = malloc(size);

/* some further execution happens here... */

/* now the buffer size needs to be doubled */
if (size &gt; SIZE_MAX / 2) {
  /* handle overflow error */
  /* . probably appropriate to use free( ptr ) here . */
  return (1);
}
size *= 2;
ptr = realloc(ptr, size);
if (ptr == NULL) {
  /* the realloc failed (it returned a null pointer), but
     the original address in ptr has been lost so the
     memory cannot be freed and a leak has occurred */
  /* ... */
  return 1;
}
/* ... */
&lt;/source&gt;

===Use after free===
After a pointer has been passed to &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt;, it becomes a [[dangling pointer]]: it references a region of memory with undefined content, which may not be available for use. The pointer's value cannot be accessed. For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int *ptr = malloc(sizeof (int));
free(ptr);
*ptr = 7; /* Undefined behavior */
&lt;/source&gt;
Code like this has undefined behavior: its effect may vary.

&lt;!--[Unsourced]
Even attempting to print the variable with [[printf]] is undefined behavior (assuming &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; did not return a null pointer); for example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
printf(&quot;%p&quot;, (void *) ptr); /* Undefined behavior */
&lt;/source&gt;
--&gt;
Commonly, the system may have reused freed memory for other purposes. Therefore, writing through a pointer to a deallocated region of memory may result in overwriting another piece of data somewhere else in the program. Depending on what data is overwritten, this may result in data corruption or cause the program to crash at a later time. A particularly bad example of this problem is if the same pointer is passed to &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; twice, known as a ''double free''. 'Use after free' and 'Double free' bugs can lead to security vulnerabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/415.html |title=CWE - CWE-415: Double Free (2.1) |work=Cwe.mitre.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid this, some programmers set pointers to &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; after passing them to &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/free.html The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 6] on The Open Group accessed at March 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
free(ptr);
ptr = NULL; /*is safe (throws away the pointer's location).*/
&lt;/source&gt;
However, this will not protect other aliases to the same pointer from being misused.

===Freeing unallocated memory===

Another problem is when &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; is passed an address that was not allocated by &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;realloc&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;calloc&lt;/code&gt;.  This can be caused when a pointer to a literal string or the name of a declared array is passed to &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt;, for example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char *msg = &quot;Default message&quot;;
int tbl[100];
&lt;/source&gt;
Passing either of the above pointers to &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; will result in undefined behaviour.

A common error is to free the memory, then use it:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char *ch_ptr = malloc(20);
for (i = 0; i &lt; 19; i++) ch_ptr[i] = 'A';
i[19] = '\0';
free(ch_ptr);
printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, ch_ptr);
&lt;/source&gt;
This will run on many systems
This happens when free() does not change the contents of
the memory being freed.
The standard for C does not guarantee this behavior.
Thus, it is certain it will fail on some systems.

When a function returns a pointer to allocated memory, the usual practice is to put the pointer returned into a
variable, use the memory, then free it using the pointer:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char *ch_ptr = malloc(20);
for (i = 0; i &lt; 19; i++) ch_ptr[i] = 'A';
i[19] = '\0';
printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, ch_ptr);
free(ch_ptr);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
This is called “used after freed”.

===Freeing memory twice===
In some programs, memory blocks are freed twice. This is because of confusion that which function is responsible for memory deallocation. Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
void main(){
      int *p;
      p = (int *)malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
      f(p);
      free(p);
}
void f(int *g){
      printf(&quot;%d&quot;, g);
      free(g);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
This is called &quot;double free&quot; or &quot;multiple free&quot;. This code will run on some systems, but may break on the second &lt;tt&gt;free&lt;/tt&gt;.

==Implementations==
The implementation of memory management depends greatly upon operating system and architecture.  Some operating systems supply an allocator for malloc, while others supply functions to control certain regions of data. The same dynamic memory allocator is often used to implement both &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; and the operator &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; in [[C++]] {{citation needed|date=January 2011}}. Hence, it is referred to below as the ''allocator'' rather than &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt;.

===Heap-based===
Implementation of the allocator on [[IA-32]] architectures is commonly done using the [[heap memory|heap]], or data segment.  The allocator will usually expand and contract the heap to fulfill allocation requests.

The heap method suffers from a few inherent flaws, stemming entirely from [[fragmentation (computer)|fragmentation]].  Like any method of memory allocation, the heap will become fragmented; that is, there will be sections of used and unused memory in the allocated space on the heap.  A good allocator will attempt to find an unused area of already allocated memory to use before resorting to expanding the heap. The major problem with this method is that the heap has only two significant attributes:  base, or the beginning of the heap in virtual memory space; and length, or its size.  The heap requires enough system memory to fill its entire length, and its base can never change.  Thus, any large areas of unused memory are wasted.  The heap can get &quot;stuck&quot; in this position if a small used segment exists at the end of the heap, which could waste any magnitude of address space, from a few megabytes to a few hundred.

===dlmalloc and its derivatives===
[[Doug Lea]] is the author of a memory allocator called [ftp://g.oswego.edu/pub/misc/ dlmalloc] (&quot;Doug Lea's Malloc&quot;) whose source code describes itself as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;This is not the fastest, most space-conserving, most portable, or
  most tunable malloc ever written. However it is among the fastest
  while also being among the most space-conserving, portable and
  tunable.  Consistent balance across these factors results in a good
  general-purpose allocator for malloc-intensive programs.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first implementation of dlmalloc was created in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html |title=A Memory Allocator |work=Gee.cs.oswego.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is written in C and is highly portable, being known to work well on all major operating systems and processor architectures and on systems ranging from medium/small embedded right up to supercomputers{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}. Due to its longevity and open source nature, dlmalloc is widely used for teaching purposes and as a foundation for other allocators, the best known of which is [http://www.malloc.de/en/index.html ptmalloc2/ptmalloc3]. Since the v2.3 release, the [[GNU C library]] (glibc) uses a '''modified''' ptmalloc2, which itself is based on dlmalloc v2.7.0.&lt;ref name=&quot;phrack-57-8&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kaempf |first=Michel |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2001 |month= |title=Vudo malloc tricks |journal=[[Phrack]] |volume= |issue=57 |page=8 |id= |url=http://phrack.org/issues.html?issue=57&amp;id=8&amp;mode=txt |accessdate=2009-04-29 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another, lesser known dlmalloc derivative is [http://www.nedprod.com/programs/portable/nedmalloc/ nedmalloc] which is based on dlmalloc v2.8.4 and is essentially dlmalloc wrapped by a per-thread lookaside cache to improve execution concurrency.

Memory on the [[heap memory|heap]] is allocated as &quot;chunks&quot;, an 8-byte [[data structure alignment|aligned]] [[data structure]] which contains a header and usable memory. Allocated memory contains an 8 or 16 byte overhead for the size of the chunk and usage flags. Unallocated chunks also store pointers to other free chunks in the usable space area, making the minimum chunk size 24-bytes.&lt;ref name=&quot;phrack-57-8&quot;/&gt;

Unallocated memory is grouped into &quot;[[bin (computational geometry)|bins]]&quot; of similar sizes, implemented by using a double-linked list of chunks (with pointers stored in the unallocated space inside the chunk).&lt;ref name=&quot;phrack-57-8&quot;/&gt;

For requests below 256 bytes (a &quot;smallbin&quot; request), a simple two power best fit allocator is used. A CPU special op (on GCC this is __builtin_clz()) is used to very quickly find the first set bit and a block is returned for the bin corresponding to that top bit position. If there are no free blocks in that bin, a block from the next highest bin is split in two.

For requests of 256 bytes or above but below the mmap threshold, i.e. what dlmalloc calls a &quot;largebin&quot; request, recent versions of dlmalloc use [[Trie#Bitwise tries|an in-place ''bitwise trie'' algorithm]]. This traverses a binary tree on the basis of each bit state after the first set bit which modern out-of-order CPUs can do very efficiently and which is mostly invariant to the number of allocated blocks. A big advantage of this algorithm is that if it fails to find the size requested, it returns the block with the next biggest size which makes it very easy to split that block into the size required.

For requests above the mmap threshold, the memory is always allocated using the [[mmap]] system call. The threshold is 256 KB (1 MB on ptmalloc2) by default, but can be changed by calling the mallopt function.&lt;ref name=&quot;glibc-env&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Malloc-Tunable-Parameters.html |title=Malloc Tunable Parameters |publisher=[[GNU]] |accessdate=2009-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mmap method averts problems with huge buffers trapping a small allocation at the end after their expiration, but always allocates an entire [[Page (computing)|page]] of memory, which on many architectures are 4096 bytes in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sanderson, Bruce|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/555223|title=RAM, Virtual Memory, Pagefile and all that stuff|publisher=Microsoft Help and Support|date=2004-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If additional memory below the threshold but less than the available free space needs to be allocated, dlmalloc may use the &lt;code&gt;brk()&lt;/code&gt; call to the [[Linux kernel]] to increase the size of the heap. Increasing the size of the heap increases the size of the top-most chunk ([[wilderness chunk]]), which is always unallocated, and is treated specially by malloc.&lt;ref name=&quot;phrack-57-8&quot;/&gt;

dlmalloc has a fairly weak free space segment coalescer algorithm, mainly because free space coalescing tends to be extremely slow due to causing [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] cache exhaustion. It is called every (by default) 4096 free() operations and it works by iterating each of the segments previously requested from the system which were not contiguously returned by the system. It tries to identify large ranges of memory which contain no allocated blocks and breaking its segment into two with the free memory being returned to the system. This algorithm works well if dlmalloc is the sole user of the VM system, however if dlmalloc is used simultaneously with another allocator then dlmalloc's free space coalescer can fail to correctly identify opportunities for free memory release.

[http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=tree;f=malloc glibc implementation of ptmalloc2]  differs from dlmalloc in this case as it generally requests extra memory from the kernel using [[mmap]] to allocate 1Mb aligned chunks, which its source code refers to as ''arenas''. ptmalloc2 tries to ensure separate arenas per execution thread, thus permitting concurrency within the memory allocator.

ptmalloc3 improves significantly on ptmalloc2 by making the smallbins of dlmalloc (described above) per-thread. This allows ptmalloc3 to offer lock free concurrency for smaller blocks while still allowing separate arenas for largebin allocations. Allocations beyond the mmap threshold still route exclusively through mmap().

nedmalloc is similar to ptmalloc2 in its support of multiple per-thread arenas, but it also adds a separate per-thread lookaside cache for smaller sized blocks which avoids processor serialisation for typical C++ usage patterns much as ptmalloc3 does. nedmalloc, like Hoard referred to below, is able to patch [[Microsoft Windows]] binaries to replace the system allocator with itself within a given process. The most recent versions of nedmalloc implement a user mode page allocator which replaces mmap(), thus allowing memory pages to be held in a lookaside cache and therefore greatly improving the speed of large allocations.

All of dlmalloc, ptmalloc2, ptmalloc3 and nedmalloc are licensed under an open source licence and are therefore available for student study.

===FreeBSD's and NetBSD's &lt;code&gt;jemalloc&lt;/code&gt;===
Since [[FreeBSD]] 7.0 and [[NetBSD]] 5.0, the old &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; implementation (phkmalloc) was replaced by [http://www.canonware.com/jemalloc/ jemalloc], written by Jason Evans.  The main reason for this was a lack of scalability of phkmalloc in terms of multithreading.  In order to avoid lock contention, jemalloc uses separate &quot;arenas&quot; for each [[CPU]].  Experiments measuring number of allocations per second in multithreading application have shown that this makes it scale linearly with the number of threads, while for both phkmalloc and dlmalloc performance was inversely proportional to the number of threads.&lt;ref&gt;http://people.freebsd.org/~jasone/jemalloc/bsdcan2006/jemalloc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

jemalloc is used as the default allocator, in Windows and Linux, of [[Mozilla Firefox|Firefox]] 3 beta4pre and later instead of the one provided by the operating system, except for Mac OS X.  This improves performance and lowers memory consumption, due to less fragmentation.

===OpenBSD's &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt;===
[[OpenBSD]]'s implementation of the &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; function makes use of &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;. For requests greater in size than one page, the entire allocation is retrieved using &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;; smaller sizes are assigned from memory pools maintained by &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; within a number of &quot;bucket pages,&quot; also allocated with &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;. On a call to &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt;, memory is released and unmapped from the process [[address space]] using &lt;code&gt;munmap&lt;/code&gt;. This system is designed to improve security by taking advantage of the [[address space layout randomization]] and gap page features implemented as part of OpenBSD's &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt; [[system call]], and to detect [[#Use after free|use-after-free bugs]]—as a large memory allocation is completely unmapped after it is freed, further use causes a [[segmentation fault]] and termination of the program.

===Hoard's &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt;===
The [[Hoard memory allocator]] is an allocator whose goal is scalable memory allocation performance. Like OpenBSD's allocator, Hoard uses &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt; exclusively, but manages memory in chunks of 64 kilobytes called superblocks. Hoard's heap is logically divided into a single global heap and a number of per-processor heaps. In addition, there is a thread-local cache that can hold a limited number of superblocks. By allocating only from superblocks on the local per-thread or per-processor heap, and moving mostly-empty superblocks to the global heap so they can be reused by other processors, Hoard keeps fragmentation low while achieving near linear scalability with the number of threads.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.umass.edu/~emery/pubs/berger-asplos2000.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thread-caching malloc &lt;code&gt;tcmalloc&lt;/code&gt; ===
Every thread has local storage for small allocations. For large allocations mmap or [[sbrk]] can be used. [http://code.google.com/p/google-perftools/ Tcmalloc] has garbage-collection for local storage of dead threads. The TCmalloc is considered to be more than twice as fast as glibc's ptmalloc for multithreaded programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://goog-perftools.sourceforge.net/doc/tcmalloc.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Callaghan |url=http://mysqlha.blogspot.com/2009/01/double-sysbench-throughput-with_18.html |title=High Availability MySQL: Double sysbench throughput with TCMalloc |work=Mysqlha.blogspot.com |date=2009-01-18 |accessdate=2011-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In-kernel===
Operating system [[kernel (computer science)|kernels]] need to allocate memory just as application programs do. The implementation of &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; within a kernel often differs significantly from the implementations used by C libraries, however. For example, memory buffers might need to conform to special restrictions imposed by [[Direct memory access|DMA]], or the memory allocation function might be called from interrupt context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.netfilter.org/~rusty/unreliable-guides/kernel-hacking/routines-kmalloc.html |title=kmalloc()/kfree() include/linux/slab.h |work=People.netfilter.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This necessitates a &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; implementation tightly integrated with the [[virtual memory]] subsystem of the operating system kernel.

In Linux and Unix kmalloc and kfree provide the functionality of malloc and free in the kernel. In Windows drivers, ExAllocatePoolWithTag, ExAllocatePoolWithQuotaTag and ExFreePoolWithTag provide the malloc/free semantic functionality in kernel mode.

==Allocation size limits==
The largest possible memory block &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; can allocate depends on the host system, particularly the size of physical memory and the operating system implementation. Theoretically, the largest number should be the maximum value that can be held in a &lt;code&gt;[[size_t]]&lt;/code&gt; type, which is an implementation-dependent unsigned integer representing the size of an area of memory. The maximum value is &lt;code&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;CHAR_BIT*sizeof(size_t)&lt;/sup&gt; − 1&lt;/code&gt;, or the constant &lt;code&gt;SIZE_MAX&lt;/code&gt; in the C99 standard.

      <text xml:space="preserve">mbrtowc() function is used for converting the multibyte character to wide character using conversion state.&lt;br /&gt; 
==mbrtowc()==

====Function of mbrtowc()====
&lt;br /&gt;
mbrtowc() convert the multibyte character to wide character using conversion states
&lt;br /&gt;

====SYNOPSIS of a function mbrtowc():====

&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;include &lt;wchar.h&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

size_t mbrtowc(wchar_t *pwc, const char *s, size_t n, mbstate_t *ps);&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Description of mbrtowc() function:====
&lt;br /&gt;
Let us consider s is a Null [[pointer]]. Then mbrtowc() function can be called as:&lt;br /&gt;
mbrtowc(NULL, &quot;&quot;, 1, ps);&lt;br /&gt;
Here value of pwc and n is ignored.&lt;br /&gt;
If s is not NULL, function should inspects mostly n bytes starting from where first s is pointed for the determination of number of bytes that will be needed for the completion of next character and it determines the value of corresponding wide character. And then if pwc is not a [[null pointer]],it stored that value in the object pointed by pwc. If that corresponding wide character is wide [[null character]] then whatever is the  resulting state described is the initial conversion state.&lt;br /&gt;
If the specified state pointer i.e. if ps is a null pointer then mbrtowc() function should use its own mbstate_t object, which shall be initialzed to the initial conversion state at the starting of the program. Otherwise mbstate_t object pointed to by ps should be used to describe the current conversion state of the associated character sequence.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

====Parameter used:====
&lt;br /&gt;
''s'':
&lt;br /&gt;

''s'' is used as [[string]] whose bytes are to be converted or counted.&lt;br /&gt;

''n'':
&lt;br /&gt;

''n'' is used for specification of maximum number of bytes for examination.&lt;br /&gt;

''ps'':
&lt;br /&gt;

''ps'' is the conversion state. If this is null then internal mbstate_t object is used.&lt;br /&gt;

====Return values:====
&lt;br /&gt;

''0'':
&lt;br /&gt;

It returns 0 when the next count or fewer bytes complete the [[multibyte]] character that represent a null wide character.&lt;br /&gt;

''&gt;0'':
&lt;br /&gt;

It returns the value greater than zero i.e. positive value when the next count or fewer bytes complete the valid multibyte character, the value return is the number of bytes that complete the multibyte character.&lt;br /&gt;

''-1'':
&lt;br /&gt;

It returns -1 when an [[encoding]] error occurs, i.e. the next count or fewer bytes dont contribute for complete and valid multibyte character, the [[errno]] value will be [[EILSEQ]] and the conversion state is confusing as it can be understood in more ways.&lt;br /&gt;

''-2''
&lt;br /&gt;

It returns -2 when the next count bytes contribute to an incomplete multibyte and  all count bytes have been processed.&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{lowercase}}
C's '''&lt;tt&gt;offsetof&lt;/tt&gt;()''' macro is an [[ANSI C]] library feature found in &lt;tt&gt;[[stddef.h]]&lt;/tt&gt;. It evaluates to the offset (in bytes) of a given member within a [[struct]] or [[union (computer science)|union]] type, an expression of type &lt;tt&gt;[[size_t]]&lt;/tt&gt;.  The &lt;tt&gt;offsetof&lt;/tt&gt;() macro takes two [[parameters]], the first being a structure name, and the second being the name of a member within the structure.  It can not be described as a C prototype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dz4y9b9a.aspx
| publisher = [[MSDN]]
| title = offsetof reference
| accessdate = 2010-09-19
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
The &quot;traditional&quot; implementation of the macro relied on the compiler being not especially picky about pointers; it obtained the offset of a member by specifying a hypothetical structure that begins at address zero:
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
#define offsetof(st, m) \
     ((size_t) ( (char *)&amp;((st *)(0))-&gt;m - (char *)0 ))
&lt;/source&gt;

This works by casting a null pointer into a pointer to structure &lt;tt&gt;st&lt;/tt&gt;, obtaining the address of member &lt;tt&gt;m&lt;/tt&gt; within this structure, casting that address into a character pointer, then using [[pointer arithmetic]] to subtract the base address of the structure, all of which results in the number of character positions (i.e., [[byte]]s) between the beginning of the structure and the beginning of the member.

While this works correctly in many compilers, it has [[undefined behavior]] according to the C standard, since it involves both a [[dereference]] of a [[null pointer]], and a cast that violates the aliasing rules.  It also tends to produce confusing compiler diagnostics if one of the arguments is misspelled.  Modern compilers often define the macro using a [[special form]] instead, e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.4.2/gcc/Offsetof.html
| title = GCC offsetof reference
| publisher = [[Free Software Foundation]]
| accessdate = 2010-09-19
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
#define offsetof(st, m) __builtin_offsetof(st, m)
&lt;/source&gt;

==Usage==
It is useful when implementing generic data structures in C.  For example, the [[Linux kernel]] uses &lt;tt&gt;offsetof()&lt;/tt&gt; to implement &lt;tt&gt;[[container_of]]()&lt;/tt&gt;, which allows something like a [[Mixin]] type to find the structure that contains it:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.kroah.com/log/linux/container_of.html
| title = &lt;tt&gt;container_of()&lt;/tt&gt;
| author = Greg Kroah-Hartman
| publisher = [[Linux Journal]]
| date = 2003-06
| accessdate = 2010-09-19
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#define container_of(ptr, type, member) ({ \
                const typeof( ((type *)0)-&gt;member ) *__mptr = (ptr); \
                (type *)( (char *)__mptr - offsetof(type,member) );})
&lt;/source&gt;

This macro is used to retrieve an enclosing structure from a pointer to a nested element, such as this iteration of a linked list of &lt;tt&gt;my_struct&lt;/tt&gt; objects:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
struct my_struct {
  const char * name;
  struct list_node list;
};

extern struct list_node * list_next(struct list_node *);

struct list_node * iter = /* ... */
while (iter)
{
  struct my_struct * elem = container_of(iter, struct my_struct, list);
  printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, elem-&gt;name);
  iter = list_next(&amp;elem-&gt;list);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

'''qsort''' is a function used to [[Sorting algorithm|sort elements in an array]]. It is named after the [[quicksort]] algorithm, although the C standard does not require it to be implemented using any specific algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | url=http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf 
 | title=ISO/IEC 9899:1999 specification
 | at=p. 319, § 7.20.5.2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;code&gt;qsort&lt;/code&gt; is a [[generic programming|generic function]] that can sort arrays of any size, containing any kind of object (although, if the objects are not the same in size, [[Pointer (computing)|pointer]]s have to be used) and using any kind of comparison predicate. The genericity, however, comes at the expense of [[type-safety]], since &lt;code&gt;qsort&lt;/code&gt; operates on [[void pointer]]s.

==Prototype==
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
void qsort(void *base, size_t nmemb, size_t size, int (*compare)(const void *, const void *));
&lt;/source&gt;

== Behaviour ==
The contents of the array are sorted in order according to a comparison function pointed to by compare. When items compare equal, their order in resulting array is unspecified, meaning qsort is not required to be a [[stable sort]].

{{lowercase|title=strcat}}
In [[computing]], the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] offers a [[C standard library|library function]] called '''&lt;tt&gt;strcat&lt;/tt&gt;''' that allows one memory block to be appended to another memory block. Both memory blocks are required to be null-terminated. Since, in C, strings are not first-class [[datatype]]s, and are implemented as blocks of [[ASCII]] [[byte]]s in memory, &lt;tt&gt;strcat&lt;/tt&gt; will effectively append one string to another given two [[Pointer (computing)|pointer]]s to blocks of allocated memory.  The name &lt;tt&gt;strcat&lt;/tt&gt; is an abbreviation of &quot;string [[concatenation|concatenate]]&quot;. &lt;tt&gt;strcat&lt;/tt&gt; is found in the &lt;tt&gt;[[string.h]]&lt;/tt&gt; header file. 

For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char str1[14] = &quot;Hello,&quot;;    /* The array has enough space for 'Hello,' plus &quot; world!&quot; plus a null terminator */
strcat(str1, &quot; world!&quot;);
puts(str1);                 /* prints &quot;Hello, world!&quot; to stdout followed by a newline */
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is a possible implementation of &lt;tt&gt;strcat&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char *
strcat(char *dest, const char *src)
{
    size_t i,j;
    for (i = 0; dest[i] != '\0'; i++)
        ;
    for (j = 0; src[j] != '\0'; j++)
        dest[i+j] = src[j];
    dest[i+j] = '\0';
    return dest;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

It can also be defined in terms of other string library functions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char *
strcat(char *dest, const char *src)
{
    strcpy(dest + strlen(dest), src);
    return dest;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Bounds errors ==

&lt;tt&gt;strcat&lt;/tt&gt; can be dangerous because if the string to be appended is too long to fit in the destination buffer, it will overwrite adjacent memory, invoking undefined behavior. Usually the program will simply cause a [[segmentation fault]] when this occurs, but a skilled attacker can use such a [[buffer overflow]] to break into a system (see [[computer security]]).

== Bounds checking variants ==

To prevent buffer overflows, several alternatives for &lt;tt&gt;strcat&lt;/tt&gt; have been used. All of them take an extra argument which encodes the length of the destination buffer and will not write past that buffer end. All of them can still result in buffer overflows if an incorrect length is provided.

=== strncat ===

 char* strncat(char* dst, const char* src, size_t n);

The most common bounded variant, &lt;tt&gt;strncat&lt;/tt&gt;, only appends a specified number of bytes, ''plus a NULL byte''. This allows each concatenated string to use no more than its &quot;share&quot; of a buffer and was perhaps intended to make tables. It is poorly suited to the more common need of getting the prefix of the concatenated string that fits in the buffer. For this the proper value to pass for the count is &lt;tt&gt;bufferSize-strlen(buffer)-1&lt;/tt&gt;. Common mistakes are to pass &lt;tt&gt;bufferSize&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;bufferSize-1&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;bufferSize-strlen(buffer)&lt;/tt&gt;, all of which can still produce a buffer overflow.

=== strlcat ===
{{main|strlcat}}

 size_t strlcat(char* dst, const char* src, size_t size);

The &lt;tt&gt;[[strlcat]]&lt;/tt&gt; function, created by [[OpenBSD]] developers [[Todd C. Miller]] and [[Theo de Raadt]], is often regarded as a safer and more useful version of &lt;tt&gt;strncat&lt;/tt&gt;. It takes the actual length of the buffer as an argument, and returns the number of bytes that would be needed allowing the caller to reallocate the buffer if possible. It has been ported to a number of [[operating system]]s, but notably rejected by [[glibc]] maintainers, who suggest that C programmers need to keep track of string length and that &quot;using this function only
leads to other errors.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;libc-alpha-discussion-1&quot;&gt;[http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-alpha/ libc-alpha mailing list], selected messages from 8 Aug 2000 thread: [http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-alpha/2000-08/msg00053.html 53], [http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-alpha/2000-08/msg00060.html 60], [http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-alpha/2000-08/msg00061.html 61]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Lowercase|title=strcmp}}

In [[POSIX]] and in the [[programming language]] [[C (programming language)|C]], &lt;code&gt;'''strcmp'''&lt;/code&gt; is a [[Subroutine|function]] in the [[C standard library]] (declared in &lt;code&gt;[[string.h]]&lt;/code&gt;) that compares two [[C string]]s.

The [[Function prototype|prototype]] according [[C99|ISO/IEC 9899:1999]], 7.21.4.2 
:&lt;code&gt;int strcmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;strcmp&lt;/code&gt; returns 0 when the strings are equal, a negative integer when &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt; is less than &lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt;, or a positive integer if &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt; is greater than &lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt;, according to the [[lexicographical order]].

A variant of &lt;code&gt;strcmp&lt;/code&gt; exists called &lt;code&gt;[[strncmp]]&lt;/code&gt; that only compares the strings up to a certain offset.

Another variant, &lt;code&gt;[[strcasecmp]]&lt;/code&gt;, conforming to POSIX.1-2001, works like &lt;code&gt;strcmp&lt;/code&gt;, but is case-insensitive. Some systems instead provide this functionality with functions named &lt;code&gt;stricmp&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;strcmpi&lt;/code&gt;. To compare a subset of both strings with case-insensitivity, various systems may provide &lt;code&gt;strncasecmp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;strnicmp&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;strncmpi&lt;/code&gt;.

==Example==
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main (int argc, char **argv)
{
    int v;

    if (argc &lt; 3)
    {
        fprintf (stderr, &quot;Compares two strings\nUsage: %s string1 string2\n&quot;,argv[0]);
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    v = strcmp (argv[1], argv[2]);

    if (v &lt; 0)
        printf (&quot;'%s' is less than '%s'.\n&quot;, argv[1], argv[2]);
    else if (v == 0)
        printf (&quot;'%s' equals '%s'.\n&quot;, argv[1], argv[2]);
    else if (v &gt; 0)
        printf (&quot;'%s' is greater than '%s'.\n&quot;, argv[1], argv[2]);

    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
The above code is a working sample that prints whether the first argument is less than, equal to or greater than the second.

A possible implementation is ([[P. J. Plauger|P.J. Plauger]], The Standard C Library, 1992):
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
int strcmp (const char * s1, const char * s2)
{
    for(; *s1 == *s2; ++s1, ++s2)
        if(*s1 == 0)
            return 0;
    return *(unsigned char *)s1 &lt; *(unsigned char *)s2 ? -1 : 1;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
However, most real-world implementations will have various optimization tricks to reduce the execution time of the function. One will notice, that strcmp not only returns -1, 0 and +1, but also other negative or positive values, resulting from optimizing away the branching introduced by the &lt;code&gt;?:&lt;/code&gt; operator:
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
return *(const unsigned char *)s1 - *(const unsigned char *)s2;
&lt;/source&gt;

{{lowercase|title=strcpy}}
The [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] offers a [[C standard library|library function]] called '''&lt;tt&gt;strcpy&lt;/tt&gt;''', defined in the [[string.h]] header file, that allows null-terminated memory blocks to be copied from one location to another. Since [[C string|strings in C]] are not first-class [[data type]]s and are implemented instead as contiguous blocks of [[byte]]s in memory, &lt;tt&gt;strcpy&lt;/tt&gt; will effectively copy strings given two [[Pointer (computing)|pointer]]s to blocks of allocated memory.

The prototype of the function is:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf ISO/IEC 9899:1999 specification], p. 326, § 7.21.2.3&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang=c&gt;char *strcpy(char *destination, const char *source);
&lt;/source&gt;
The argument order mimics that of an assignment: destination &quot;=&quot; source. The return value is &lt;code&gt;destination&lt;/code&gt;.

== Usage and implementation ==
For example
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char *str1 = &quot;abcdefghijklmnop&quot;;
char *str2 = malloc(100); /* must be large enough to hold the string! */
strcpy(str2, str1); /* str2 is now &quot;abcdefghijklmnop&quot; */
str2[0] = 'A'; /* str2 is now &quot;Abcdefghijklmnop&quot; */
/* str1 is still &quot;abcdefghijklmnop&quot; */
&lt;/source&gt;
In the second line memory is allocated to hold the copy of the string, then the string is copied from one memory block into the other, then the first letter of that copy is modified.

Although the simple assignment &lt;tt&gt;str2 = str1&lt;/tt&gt; might appear to do the same thing, it only copies the memory address of &lt;tt&gt;str1&lt;/tt&gt; into &lt;tt&gt;str2&lt;/tt&gt; but not the actual string. Both &lt;tt&gt;str1&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;str2&lt;/tt&gt; would refer to the same memory block, and the allocated block that used to be pointed to by &lt;tt&gt;str2&lt;/tt&gt; would be lost. The assignment to str2[0] would either also modify str1, or it would cause an access violation (as modern compilers often place the string constants in read-only memory).

The &lt;tt&gt;strcpy&lt;/tt&gt; function performs a copy by iterating over the individual characters of the string and copying them one by one. An explicit implementation of &lt;tt&gt;strcpy&lt;/tt&gt; is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char *strcpy(char *dest, const char *src)
{
  unsigned i;
  for (i=0; src[i] != '\0'; ++i)
    dest[i] = src[i];
  dest[i] = '\0';
  return dest;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

A common compact implementation is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char *strcpy(char *dest, const char *src)
{
   char *save = dest;
   while(*dest++ = *src++);
   return save;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Modern versions provided by C libraries often copy far more than one byte at a time, relying on bit math to detect if the larger word has a null byte before writing it. Often a call compiles into an inline machine instruction specifically designed to do &lt;tt&gt;strcpy&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Unicode ==

&lt;tt&gt;strcpy&lt;/tt&gt; will work for all common byte encodings of Unicode strings, including [[UTF-8]]. There is no need to actually know the encoding as long as the null byte is never used by it.

If Unicode is encoded in units larger than a byte, such as [[UTF-16]], then a different function is needed, as null bytes will occur in parts of the larger code units. C99 defines the function &lt;tt&gt;wcscpy()&lt;/tt&gt;, which will copy &lt;tt&gt;[[wchar_t]]&lt;/tt&gt;-sized objects and stop at the first one with a zero value. This is not as useful as it appears, as different computer platforms disagree on how large a &lt;tt&gt;wchar_t&lt;/tt&gt; is (some use 16 bits and some 32 bits).

== Buffer overflows ==
{{main|Buffer overflow}}
&lt;tt&gt;strcpy&lt;/tt&gt; can be dangerous because if the string to be copied is too long to fit in the destination buffer, it will overwrite adjacent memory, invoking undefined behavior. Usually the program will simply cause a [[segmentation fault]] when this occurs, but a skilled attacker can use buffer overflow to break into a system. To prevent buffer overflows, several alternatives for &lt;tt&gt;strcpy&lt;/tt&gt; have been used. All of them take an extra argument which is the length of the destination buffer and will not write past that buffer end. All of them can still result in buffer overflows if an incorrect length is provided.

===strncpy===

 char* strncpy(char* dst, const char* src, size_t size);

&lt;tt&gt;strncpy&lt;/tt&gt; writes exactly the given number of bytes, either only copying the start of the string if it is too long, or adding zeros to the end of the copy to fill the buffer. It was introduced into the C library to deal with fixed-length name fields in structures such as [[dirent.h|directory entries]]. Despite its name it is not a bounded version of &lt;tt&gt;strcpy&lt;/tt&gt;; it does not guarantee that the result is a null-terminated string. The name of the function is misleading because &lt;tt&gt;strncat&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;snprintf&lt;/tt&gt; '''are''' respectively bounded versions of &lt;tt&gt;strcat&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;sprintf&lt;/tt&gt;.

The assumption that the result is a null-terminated string leads to two problems. If the source string is too long, the result is not null-terminated, making data after the end of the buffer appear to be part of the string. And if the source string is much shorter than the buffer, considerable time will be wasted filling the rest of the buffer with null bytes.

An alternative from the standard C library that will always append one null byte is to use [[strncat]] with an initially empty string as the destination.

===strlcpy===
{{main|strlcpy}}

 size_t strlcpy(char* dst, const char* src, size_t size);

The &lt;tt&gt;[[strlcpy]]&lt;/tt&gt; function, created by [[OpenBSD]] developers [[Todd C. Miller]] and [[Theo de Raadt]], is often regarded as a safer version of &lt;tt&gt;strncpy&lt;/tt&gt;. It always adds a single null byte, and returns the number of bytes that would be needed, allowing the caller to reallocate the buffer if possible. It has been ported to a number of [[operating system]]s, but notably rejected by [[Ulrich Drepper]], the [[glibc]] maintainer, who suggests that C programmers need to keep track of string length and that &quot;using this function only
leads to other errors.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;libc-alpha-discussion-1&quot;&gt;[http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-alpha/ libc-alpha mailing list], selected messages from 8 Aug 2000 thread: [http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-alpha/2000-08/msg00053.html 53], [http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-alpha/2000-08/msg00060.html 60], [http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-alpha/2000-08/msg00061.html 61]&lt;/ref&gt;

===strcpy_s===

 errno_t strcpy_s(char* dst, rsize_t size, const char* src);

'''strcspn''' is the function from the [[c standard library]] ('''header file [[string.h]]''').

It search the string for certain set of characters.

The '''strcspn()''' function calculates the length of initial segment of string 1 which does not contain any character from string 2.

== Return Value ==
This function returns the index of first character in string 1 that matches with any character of string2.

== Syntax ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

size_t strcspn( const char *str1, const char *str2 );
&lt;/source&gt;

== Example ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main(){
  char s[20] = &quot;wikireader007&quot;, t[11] = &quot;0123456789&quot;;
  printf(&quot;The first decimal digit of s is at position: %d.\n&quot;, '''strcspn'''(s, t));

  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Output''':

The first decimal digit of s is at position: 10

The string-error function, '''strerror''', is a [[C programming language|C]]/[[C++]] function which translates an error code, usually stored in the [[global variable]] [[errno]], to a human-readable error message.
==History==
The '''strerror''' function is defined in IEEE Std 1003.1, also known as [[POSIX|POSIX 1]].
==Reentrancy==
The '''strerror''' function is not [[Reentrant (subroutine)|reentrant]]. For a reentrant version of the function, see [[strerror_r]].

==Usage==
===Inclusion===
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#include &lt;string.h&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

===Declaration===
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;char* strerror(int errnum);&lt;/source&gt;

===Semantics===
The function generates and reports a [[C programming language|C]]-style string, containing an error message derived from the error code passed in with ''errnum''.

{{lowercase|title=strlen}}
In the [[C standard library]], '''&lt;tt&gt;strlen&lt;/tt&gt;''' is a [[String functions (programming)| string function]] that determines the length of a [[C string|C character string]].

==Example usage==
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
 
int main()
{
    char *string = &quot;Hello World&quot;;
    printf(&quot;%lu\n&quot;, (unsigned long)strlen(string));
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
This program will print the value 11, which is the length of the string &quot;Hello World&quot;.
Character strings are stored in an array of a data type called &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt;.  The end of a string is found by searching for the first [[null character]] in the array.  

Note importantly that this length does *NOT* include the array entry for the trailing null byte required for the ending character of C strings.  Thus, if you need to copy the C string, you need to allocate a space of strlen() + 1.

==Implementation==
[[FreeBSD]] 6.2 implements &lt;tt&gt;strlen&lt;/tt&gt; like so:&lt;ref name=&quot;bsd62strlen&quot;&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/lib/libc/string/strlen.c?rev=1.4
 | title = strlen.c Revision 1.4
 | publisher = FreeBSD
 | date = 2002-03-21 | accessdate = 2009-03-04
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
size_t strlen(const char * str)
{
    const char *s;
    for (s = str; *s; ++s) {}
    return(s - str);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

It is possible to write faster versions in C that examines full machine word rather than byte-by-byte.  [[Hacker's Delight]] has given an algorithm that makes use of [[bitwise operations]] to detect if any of these bytes is nul ('\0').  The current FreeBSD implementation does this.&lt;ref name=&quot;bsd9xstrlen&quot;&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/lib/libc/string/strlen.c?rev=1.10
 | title = strlen.c Revision 1.10
 | publisher = FreeBSD
 | date = 2010-03-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern C compilers usually provide fast inline versions of &lt;tt&gt;strlen&lt;/tt&gt; written in [[assembly language|assembly]], either using the bitwise operation technique or a special instruction provided by certain [[Complex_instruction_set_computer|CISC]] processors. In addition, &lt;tt&gt;strlen&lt;/tt&gt; of a quoted string constant is often optimized into a constant integer.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is mainly used to locate last occurrence of character in string, searching from the end. It returns a pointer to the last occurrence of character in the C string str. The terminating null-character is considered part of the C string. Therefore, it can also be located to retrieve a pointer to the end of a string.

==Syntax==
In C, this function is declared as:

char *strrchr ( const char *, int );

str is a C string.
character is the character to be located. It is passed as its int promotion, but it is internally converted back to char.

==Return value==
A pointer to the last occurrence of character in str.
If the value is not found, the function returns a [[Wikipedia:null pointer|null pointer]].

==Example==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    const char *str = &quot;This is a sample string&quot;;
    char *pch = strrchr(str, 's');
    printf(&quot;Last occurrence of 's' found at %d\n&quot;, pch - str + 1);
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Output : Last occurrence of 's' found at 18.

 | url=http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf 
 | title=ISO/IEC 9899:1999 specification

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is defined as:

:&lt;code&gt;double strtod ( const char * str, char ** endptr );&lt;/code&gt;

==Overview==
The strtod function parses the C string str interpreting its content as a floating point number and returns its value as a double. If endptr is not a null pointer, the function also sets the value pointed by endptr to point to the first character after the number.

The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes as many characters as possible that are valid following a syntax resembling that of floating point literals, and interprets them as a numerical value. A pointer to the rest of the string after the last valid character is stored in the object pointed by endptr.

A valid floating point number for strtod is formed by a succession of:

* An optional plus or minus sign
* A sequence of digits, optionally containing a decimal-point character
* An optional exponent part, which itself consists on an 'e' or 'E' character followed by an optional sign and a sequence of digits.

If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str does not form a valid floating-point number as just defined, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.

==Parameters==

str
* C string beginning with the representation of a floating-point number.
endptr
* Reference to an already allocated object of type char*, whose value is set by the function to the next character in str after the numerical value. This parameter can also be a null pointer, in which case it is not used.

==Return value==
On success, the function returns the converted floating point number as a double value.
If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value (0.0) is returned.
If the correct value is out of the range of representable values, a positive or negative HUGE_VAL is returned, and the global variable errno is set to ERANGE.
If the correct value would cause underflow, zero is returned and errno is set to ERANGE.

The strtod function is included in &lt;code&gt;stdlib.h&lt;/code&gt;.

{{merge to|C string|discuss=Talk:C_standard_library#Pages_for_each_function_and_WP:NOTMANUAL|date=October 2011}}
'''strtol''' is a function in the [[C programming language]] that converts a string into a [[long integer]]. &lt;code&gt;strtol&lt;/code&gt; stands for ''string to long''. It is included in the [[C standard library]] [[header file]] &lt;code&gt;[[stdlib.h]]&lt;/code&gt;. Its prototype is as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
long strtol(const char *restrict str, char **restrict end, int base);
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt; argument points to a [[string (computer science)|string]], represented by an array of characters, containing the ''character'' representation of a signed integer value. The string must be null-terminated. The &lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt; argument specifies the [[radix|number base]] to use, from 2 to 36. If the number base is greater than 10, alphabetic characters (&lt;code&gt;'A'&lt;/code&gt; up to &lt;code&gt;'Z'&lt;/code&gt;) are used as digits in the representation. After the conversion, the value pointed to by &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; is set to point to the character following the last valid numeric character in the string and the converted integer value is returned. If the string does not contain a valid numerical sequence, zero (0) is returned and the global variable &lt;code&gt;[[errno]]&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;code&gt;EINVAL&lt;/code&gt;.

There also exist similar variants of these function named &lt;code&gt;strtoul&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;strtoll&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;strtoull&lt;/code&gt; which parses and returns an integer of the type &lt;code&gt;unsigned long&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt; [[Long_integer|long long]]&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;unsigned long long&lt;/code&gt; respectively.

==Standards conformance==

The strtol function is part of the ISO standard C library ([[C89 (C version)|C89]], 1989), and the strtoll function was added as part of the [[C99]] library (1999). It was added to the standard C library as a more well-behaved replacement for the existing [[atoi]] function.

{{lowercase|title='''swprintf'''}}
&lt;tt&gt;''swprintf''&lt;/tt&gt; is a [[C standard library]] function as defined in wchar.h and it's required header files are stdio.h and wchar.h. It has function signature as 
 '''int swprintf(wchar_t *s,, size_t n, const wchar_t format,...);''

n the signature of swprintf:&lt;/br&gt;
s : it is pointer to the buffer where you want to store the formatted string.The formatting string provides the extra arguments required &lt;/br&gt;
n : it is maximum number of characters to be stored in the buffer appending the null character.&lt;/br&gt;
format : this is the wide character string which shows the format of the output.&lt;/br&gt;

==Usage==
The swprintf  function perform wide character output to an array of wide characters. The programmer must ensure that there is space for at least 'n' wide characters at 's'.


==Description==
swprintf() is the function which prints the output after the null character in the consecutive wide character starting at *s.And it prints no n more characters up to next null character appears.swprintf is wide character version of sprintf.pointer arguments to swprintf are wide character string

==return value==
This function returns number of character written or -1 if an error exist.If s(pointer to buffer) or format is a  null pointer ,invalid parameter is invoked.If the program allows to run this code the it returns -1 or errno is set to EINVAL. swprintf returns number of wide character which are stored in 's'(buffer) not counting the last null character.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:C Programming/C Reference/time.h/time_t}}
The '''time_t''' datatype is a [[data type]] in the [[C (programming language)|ISO C]] library defined for storing [[system time]] values. Such values are returned from the standard &lt;code&gt;time()&lt;/code&gt; library function. This type is a [[typedef]] defined in the standard [[time.h|&amp;lt;time.h&amp;gt;]] header.
[[ISO C]] defines time_t as an arithmetic type, but does not specify any particular [[data type|type]], [[range (mathematics)|range]],  [[frequency|resolution]], or encoding for it. Also unspecified are the meanings of arithmetic operations applied to time values.

== Implementation ==
[[Unix]] and [[POSIX|POSIX-compliant systems]] implement '''time_t''' as an integer or [[Floating point|real-floating]] type
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/sys_types.h.html The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7 sys/types.h]. Retrieved on 2009-02-13.&lt;/ref&gt; (typically a 32- or 64-bit integer) which represents the number of seconds since the start of the [[Unix epoch]]: [[midnight]] [[UTC]] of January 1, 1970 (not counting [[leap seconds]]). Some systems correctly handle negative time values, while others do not. Systems using a signed 32-bit &lt;code&gt;time_t&lt;/code&gt; type are susceptible to the [[Year 2038 problem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rogermwilcox.com/Y2038.html The Year 2038 problem], Roger M. Wilcox. Retrieved on 2011-03-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the '''time()''' function, ISO C also specifies [[Time.h|other functions and types]] for converting '''time_t''' [[system time]] values into [[calendar date|calendar times]] and vice versa.

==Example==
The following C code retrieves the current time, formats it as a string, and writes it to the standard output.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;

/*
 * The result should look something like
 * Fri 2008-08-22 15:21:59 WAST
 */

int main(void)
{
    time_t     now;
    struct tm *ts;
    char       buf[80];

    /* Get the current time */
    now = time(NULL);

    /* Format and print the time, &quot;ddd yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss zzz&quot; */
    ts = localtime(&amp;now);
    strftime(buf, sizeof(buf), &quot;%a %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z&quot;, ts);
    puts(buf);

    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

{{-}}

== Conversion to civil time ==
Using [[GNU]] date, a given &lt;code&gt;time_t&lt;/code&gt; value can be converted into its equivalent calendar date:

 $ date -ud@1234567890
 Fri Feb 13 23:31:30 UTC 2009

Similarly, using [[BSD]] date:

 $ date -ur 1234567890
 Fri Feb 13 23:31:30 UTC 2009

In [[computing]], &lt;code&gt;'''tmpfile'''&lt;/code&gt; is an [[ISO C]]/[[POSIX]] function for creating a [[temporary file]], a [[computer file]] which ceases to exist when the [[Computer program|program]], which opened the file, closes it or terminates.&lt;ref name=&quot;opengroup&quot;&gt;[http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/tmpfile.html tmpfile] by [[OpenGroup]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/libc/Temporary-Files.html Temporary Files] by [[GNU C Library]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmug.org/man/3/tmpfile.php tmpfile] by [[Huntsville Macintosh Users Group|HMUG]]&lt;/ref&gt;

*&lt;code&gt;ENOSPC&lt;/code&gt; - if there is no space in the file system for creating the temporary file.
*&lt;code&gt;EOVERFLOW&lt;/code&gt; - if the file is a regular file and the size of the file cannot be represented correctly in an object of type off_t.
*&lt;code&gt;ENOMEM&lt;/code&gt; - if there is insufficient memory for allocating the file stream.

==Caveats==
The &lt;code&gt;'''tmpfile'''&lt;/code&gt; function is susceptible to a number of security vulnerabilities; use the non-portable &lt;code&gt;[[mkstemp]]&lt;/code&gt; ([[UNIX]]) or &lt;code&gt;[[tmpfile_s]]&lt;/code&gt; ([[Microsoft C Run-time Library|MSVCRT]]) functions, instead, to avoid these issues.&lt;ref&gt;[https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/daisy/bsi-rules/home/g1/861-BSI.html TMPNAM-TMPFILE Vulnerability] by [[Build Security In]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cert&quot;&gt;[https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/VOID+Create+temporary+files+securely VOID FI039-C. Create temporary files securely] by [[CERT]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The implementation of this function in Microsoft C run-time library tries to create the file in the root directory of the current drive and typically fails reporting &quot;Access denied&quot;.

'''Ungetc''' is a version of a [[C standard library]] function ''ungetch''.  It is somewhat a restricted function.

==Declaration==
&lt;code&gt;int ungetc (int c, FILE *stream)&lt;/code&gt;

Here, ''c'' is a character variable, stream is a file pointer and the overall function is expressed in integer data type.

==Description==
As mentioned above, rather it is a restricted version of ''ungetch'', the function pushes the character specified by the value of ''c''.  At the time of pushing, the character ''c'' is converted to a ''unsigned char'' and then pushed to the input ''stream''.  The pushed character can be returned back if a ''getc'' function is applied to the stream.

==Calling capacity==
A single push back of the character is allowed at a call.  Trying to do a push back in a succession may or may not work properly. In normal and usual practices, 4 times the function is called and hence 4 characters are pushed consecutively.  It means that the process of this function is totally machine dependent.  Hence if memory is large in extent in a machine then there is a possibility to have the push backs for infinitly large times.

==Return value==
The characters which are pushed back are returned by any subsequent read on the stream (''in reverse order'') and if the input from the stream is buffered, it means that  the  last character pushed will be returned first.  When a normal push back of the character is done, the function returns the last pushed character. If the push back operation is not done properly means if the push back of a character is unsuccessful (e.g. if the file is not open) then [[End-of-file|EOF]] character is returned as an error.  One can not push back the EOF character to the stream using ''ungetc''.  A successful call to ''ungetc'' function clears the EOF indicator for the stream.

To erase the push back characters came from call to ungetc function, a call to ''[[fseek]]'', ''fsetpos'' or ''[[fflush]]'' functions is made before the character is read from the stream.  As all the characters are pushed back are read in, the file position indicator is same as before pushing back the characters.

==''Ungetc'', a restricted version of ''ungetch''==
As stated already it is a restricted version of function ''ungetch'', it has same restrictions like when a read operation is immediately folllowed by a write operation or vice versa.  That is why, there is a requirement of a intervening reposition between ''ungetc'' and the subsequent ''write'' or ''read'' function.

&lt;tt&gt;''vwprintf''&lt;/tt&gt; is a [[C standard library]] function as defined in [[wchar.h]] .It has function signature as
 '''int vwprintf(const [[wchar_t]] *format, va_list args);'''

In signature of function vwprintf, format is format specialisation and args is pointer to arguments.

==comparision with other functions==
The functioning of vwprintf is same as that of [[swprintf]]. The difference between both functions is ''that the argument list has been replaced by a pointer to a list of argument''. vwprintf performs the wide character output to the string like stdout and stdout should not be byte oriented.

The functioning of vwprintf is same as that of swprintf.The difference between both functions is ''that the argument list has been replaced by a pointer to a list of argument''. vwprintf performs the [[wide character]] output to the string like stdout and stdout should not be byte oriented.
this function return the number of characters not including the null character and any negative value if an output error occurs
vwprintf() is equivalent to  wprintf with argument list replaced by arg and which can be initialised by ''vastart'' macro. 

==return values==
vwprintf returns number of characters written but excluding the NULL character on success.But on failure it returns an error and [[errno]] is set.

{{lowercase|title='''wprintf'''}}
&lt;tt&gt;''wprintf''&lt;/tt&gt; is a [[C standard library]] function as defined in [[wchar.h]].
It has function signature as  
 '''int wprintf(const [[wchar_t]] *format,...);'''
The wprintf() writes output to [[stdout]], the standard output stream. It uses [[Variadic function|variable argument]] lists. This function and also functions like [[vprintf]], [[vfprintf]], [[vsprintf]], [[vsnprintf]], and [[vasprintf]] offer the ability for programmers to essentially create their own printf variants.

==Usage==
The &lt;code&gt;wprintf&lt;/code&gt; function is found in [[C programming language|C]], in which writes the output to the stream under control of format strings.
the format string specifies how subsequent arguments are converted  for output.

wprintf is a [[wide character]] version of printf format. The format is a wide character string where wprintf and printf bahave similarly as they are opened in ANSI mode.

==Example==
Following is the sample code for understanding of working of the wprintf.

code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include&lt;wchar.h&gt;
int main(int argc,char *argv[])
{
      wchar_t *str = L&quot;@TAJMAHAL@#$$$&quot;;
      wprintf(L&quot;%ls\n&quot;, str);
      return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
After running the code output will be as follows:
 @TAJMAHAL@#$$$
==Limitations==
limitations:&lt;/br&gt;
1. wprintf() is not portable function.&lt;/br&gt;
2. wprintf() cannot be mixed with printf().&lt;/br&gt;
3. wprintf cannot print the double vales.
   for eg. 2^56 is the double value which cannot be printed using wprintf().

The '''Memccpy''' function ( which stands for &quot;copy bytes in memory&quot; ) is mainly a function of [[C Standard Library]], typically associated with some type of [[programming languages]].This function operate on [[strings]] in memory areas. The memccpy [[function]] shall copy bytes from one memory area to other, stopping after the first occurrence of some [[byte]] X (converted to an Unsigned char) or after n bytes are copied, whichever comes first.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Syntax == 
:&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt; void *memccpy (void *dest, const void *src, int c, size_t n);&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:{| class = 'wikitable'
|-
!   Argument  !! Description
|-
|| &lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;&quot;&gt;'''dest'''&lt;/div&gt; || It points to the location of a destination  string.
|-
|| &lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;&quot;&gt;'''src'''&lt;/div&gt; || It points to the location of a source string.
|-
|| &lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;&quot;&gt;'''c'''&lt;/div&gt; || It specifies a character for which to search and copy.
|-
|| &lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;&quot;&gt;'''n'''&lt;/div&gt; || It specifies the number of characters to be copied.
|}
In above syntax, &lt;code&gt;[[size_t]]&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;[[typedef]]&lt;/code&gt;. It is unsigned data type defined in &lt;code&gt;[[stddef.h]]&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;
== Description == 
:Here memccpy function shall copy bytes from the memory area src into dest, stopping after the first occurrence of byte c, or after n bytes are copied, whichever comes first. Here [[character]] c is also copied.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Returns == 
:The memccpy function returns a [[pointer]] to the next character in dest after c or [[NULL]] if c was not found in the first n characters of src.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Examples == 
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt; 
#include &lt;memory.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

char string1[60] = &quot;Taj Mahal is a historic monument in India.&quot;;

int main( void ) {

   char buffer[61];
   char *pdest;
   printf( &quot;Function: _memccpy 42 characters or to character 'c'\n&quot; );
   printf( &quot;Source: %s\n&quot;, string1 );
   pdest = _memccpy( buffer, string1, 'c', 42);
   *pdest = '\0';
   printf( &quot;Result: %s\n&quot;, buffer );
   printf( &quot;Length: %d characters\n&quot;, strlen( buffer ) );
}
Output
Function: _memccpy 42 characters or to character 'c'
Source: Taj Mahal is a historic monument in India.
Result: Taj Mahal is a historic
Length: 23 characters &lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

char *msg = &quot;This is the string: not copied&quot;;

void main() {

    char buffer[80];
    memset( buffer, '\0', 80 );
    memccpy( buffer, msg, ':', 80 );
    printf( &quot;%s\n&quot;, buffer );
  }
Output
This is the string: &lt;/source&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

== Application Usage == 
:The memccpy function does not check for the [[overflow]] of the receiving memory area.&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{lowercase}}

In the [[C standard library]], '''system''' is a function used to [[execution (computers)|execute]] [[process (computing)|subprocesses]] and commands. It is defined in &lt;code&gt;[[stdlib.h]]&lt;/code&gt; header.  It differs from the &lt;code&gt;[[Exec (operating system)|exec]]&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;[[Spawn (computing)|spawn]]&lt;/code&gt; family of functions in that instead of passing arguments to an executed [[Object file|object]], a single [[String (computer science)|string]] is passed to the system [[shell (computing)|shell]], typically the [[POSIX]] shell, &lt;code&gt;/bin/sh -c&lt;/code&gt;.

==Prototype==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;int system (const char *command);&lt;/source&gt;

== Behavior ==
The &lt;code&gt;system&lt;/code&gt; function is [[blocking]]; that is, the call will [[wait (operating system)|wait]] until the [[child process]] terminates and return its [[exit status|exit value]].  During this time, &lt;code&gt;[[SIGCHLD]]&lt;/code&gt; will be blocked as &lt;code&gt;system&lt;/code&gt; waits for the child to die; also, &lt;code&gt;[[SIGINT (POSIX)|SIGINT]]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[[SIGQUIT]]&lt;/code&gt; are ignored, so to ensure responsiveness the programmer should check the return value to see if the user is trying to terminate the process.  On error, system will return -1 on failure prior to or at &lt;code&gt;[[fork (operating system)|fork]]&lt;/code&gt; (e.g. process count limit reached) but will return 127 on failure after &lt;code&gt;fork&lt;/code&gt; (e.g. unable to execute sh); this is indistinguishable from the command exiting with status 127.

Under [[POSIX]], &lt;code&gt;system&lt;/code&gt; [[Fork_(operating_system)|forks]] and [[exec (operating system)|execs]] &lt;code&gt;/bin/sh&lt;/code&gt; with two arguments: &quot;&lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and &lt;code&gt;command&lt;/code&gt;.  While the behavior of sh is specified elsewhere, it is instructive to consider that &lt;code&gt;command&lt;/code&gt; need not be a single command; it can in fact be a [[Pipeline (computing)|pipeline]] or even a series of pipelines.  For example, consider a program that wishes to display a screenshot:

&lt;code&gt;
system (&quot;[[netpbm|pngtopnm]] \&quot;My Screenshot.png\&quot; | pnmtoxwd &gt; out.xwd &amp;&amp; [[xwud]] out.xwd&quot;);
&lt;/code&gt;

This line exhibits an important consideration: since &lt;code&gt;command&lt;/code&gt; will be parsed as a shell command line, quotes around e.g. file names must be [[Escape character|escape]]d.  This however raises security considerations, since if &lt;code&gt;command&lt;/code&gt; is constructed from user-supplied data, an attacker may be able to break out of any quoting and execute an arbitrary command in the context of the parent; indeed, this is almost the canonical [[code injection]] exploit.  It is thus considered sensible to only employ &lt;code&gt;system&lt;/code&gt; on predetermined command strings, using other functions (&lt;code&gt;[[Spawn (computing)|spawn]]&lt;/code&gt; et al.) to pass user-supplied data in argv or passing such data through [[pipe (Unix)|pipe]]s or [[temporary file]]s.

The child spawned by &lt;code&gt;system&lt;/code&gt; inherits its parent's [[standard streams]]; thus the child can receive keyboard input and write to the terminal.  Note that this means that the parent will not receive the child's output, except through the use of a [[Redirection (computing) | redirection]] or [[tee (Unix)|tee]].

On many computer [[operating systems]], a [[computer process]] terminates its [[execution (computers)|execution]] by making an '''exit''' [[system call]]. More generally, an exit in a [[Thread (computer science)|multithreading]] environment means that a [[thread (computer science)|thread]] of execution has stopped running. The [[operating system]] reclaims [[resource (computer science)|resources]] ([[computer storage|memory]], [[computer file|files]], etc.) that were used by the process. The process is said to be a ''[[Process states#Terminated|dead process]]'' after it terminates.

==How it works==
Under [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] [[operating systems]], a process is started when its [[parent process]] executes a ''[[fork (operating system)|fork]]'' [[system call]]. The parent process may then [[wait (operating system)|wait]] for the [[child process]] to terminate, or may continue execution (possibly forking off other child processes). When the child process terminates (&quot;dies&quot;), either normally by calling ''exit'', or [[abnormal end|abnormally]] due to a [[fatal error]] or [[signal (computing)|signal]] (e.g., [[SIGTERM]], [[SIGINT (POSIX)|SIGINT]], [[SIGKILL]]), an [[exit status]] is returned to the operating system and a [[SIGCHLD]] signal is sent to the parent process. The exit status can then be retrieved by the parent process via the ''[[wait (operating system)|wait]]'' system call.

Most operating systems allow the terminating process to provide a specific [[exit status]] to the system, which is made available to the parent process. Typically this is a small integer value, although some operating systems (e.g., [[Plan 9 (operating system)|Plan 9]]) allow a [[character string]] to be specified.

===Clean up===
The exit operation typically performs clean-up operations within the process space before returning control back to the operating system. Some systems and [[programming languages]] allow user [[subroutines]] to be registered so that they are invoked at program termination before the process actually terminates for good. As the final step of termination, a primitive system exit call is invoked, informing the operating system that the process has terminated and allows it to reclaim the resources used by the process.

It is sometimes possible to bypass the usual cleanup; [[C99]] offers the &lt;code&gt;_exit()&lt;/code&gt; function which terminates the current process without any extra program clean-up.  This may be used, for example, in a [[fork-exec]] routine when the &lt;code&gt;[[exec]]&lt;/code&gt; call fails to replace the child process; calling &lt;code&gt;atexit&lt;/code&gt; routines would erroneously release resources belonging to the parent.

===Orphans and zombies===
Some operating systems handle a child process whose parent process has terminated in a special manner.  Such an ''[[orphan process]]'' becomes a child of a special ''[[init|root process]]'', which then waits for the child process to terminate. Likewise, a similar strategy is used to deal with a ''[[zombie process]]'', which is a child process that has terminated but whose exit status is ignored by its parent process.  Such a process becomes the child of a special parent process, which retrieves the child's exit status and allows the operating system to complete the termination of the dead process. Dealing with these special cases keeps the system [[process table]] in a consistent state.

==Examples==

The following programs terminate and return a success [[exit status]] to the system.

[[C (programming language)|C]]:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

or:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

[[C++]]:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;

int main(void)
{
    std::exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); // or return EXIT_SUCCESS
}
&lt;/source&gt;

[[COBOL]]:

 IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
 PROGRAM-ID. SUCCESS-PROGRAM.
 
 PROCEDURE DIVISION.
 MAIN.
     MOVE ZERO TO RETURN-CODE.
 END PROGRAM.

[[Java (programming language)|Java]]:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class Success
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.exit(0);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

[[DOS]] [[Batch file]]:
&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
exit 0
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Perl]]:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
#!/bin/perl
exit;
&lt;/source&gt;

[[PHP]]:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
exit(0);
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Python (programming language)|Python]]:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/python
import sys
sys.exit(0)
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Unix shell]]:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
exit 0
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]:
&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;
program pr1;
begin
 exit(0);
end;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;fenv.h&lt;/code&gt; is a header file containing various functions and macros for manipulating the floating-point environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;sus&quot;&gt;{{man|bd|fenv.h|SUS|floating-point environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This header declares two types, &lt;code&gt;fenv_t&lt;/code&gt; (represents the whole floating-point environment) and &lt;code&gt;fexcept_t&lt;/code&gt; (represents the floating-point status flags).&lt;ref name=&quot;sus&quot; /&gt; It also declares several feature macros, beginning with &lt;code&gt;FE_&lt;/code&gt; and a capital letter.

==Functions==
Other than &lt;code&gt;fegetround&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fetestexcept&lt;/code&gt;, these functions return zero/non-zero on success/failure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The header '''float.h''' contains macros that expand to various limits and parameters of the standard floating-point types.

The macros, as defined on ISO 9899:1999 section 5.2.4.2.2, are:

* &lt;code&gt;FLT_ROUNDS&lt;/code&gt; – indicates the rounding mode for floating-point addition, meaning:
:* &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt; indeterminable;
:* &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; toward zero;
:* &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; to nearest;
:* &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; toward positive infinity;
:* &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt; toward negative infinity;
:* other value means implementation-defined rounding behavior.

* &lt;code&gt;FLT_EVAL_METHOD&lt;/code&gt; (C99) – determines the evaluation formats of expressions involving all floating types:
:* &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt; indeterminable;
:* &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; evaluate all operations and constants just to the precision of the type;
:* &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; evaluate operations and constants of type '''float''' and '''double''' to the range and precision of the '''double''' type;
:* &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; evaluate all operations and constants to the range and precision of the '''long double''' type;
:* other value means implementation-defined behavior.

* &lt;code&gt;FLT_RADIX&lt;/code&gt; – radix of exponent representation (at least &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;).

* &lt;code&gt;FLT_MANT_DIG&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DBL_MANT_DIG&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LDBL_MANT_DIG&lt;/code&gt; – number of digits in the floating-point significand.

* &lt;code&gt;DECIMAL_DIG&lt;/code&gt; (C99) – (at least &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;)

* &lt;code&gt;FLT_DIG&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DBL_DIG&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LDBL_DIG&lt;/code&gt; - (at least &lt;/code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;/code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;/code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;)

* &lt;code&gt;FLT_MIN_EXP&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DBL_MIN_EXP&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LDBL_MIN_EXP&lt;/code&gt;

* &lt;code&gt;FLT_MIN_10_EXP&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DBL_MIN_10_EXP&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LDBL_MIN_10_EXP&lt;/code&gt;, (at least &lt;code&gt;-37&lt;/code&gt;)

* &lt;code&gt;FLT_MAX_EXP&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DBL_MAX_EXP&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LDBL_MAX_EXP&lt;/code&gt;

* &lt;code&gt;FLT_MAX_10_EXP&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DBL_MAX_10_EXP&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LDBL_MAX_10_EXP&lt;/code&gt; (at least &lt;code&gt;+37&lt;/code&gt;)

* &lt;code&gt;FLT_MAX&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DBL_MAX&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LDBL_MAX&lt;/code&gt; – (Maximum value, at least &lt;code&gt;1E+37&lt;/code&gt;)

* &lt;code&gt;FLT_EPSILON&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DBL_EPSILON&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LDBL_EPSILON&lt;/code&gt; – (Machine epsilon, no greater than &lt;code&gt;1E-5&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;1E-9&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;1E-9&lt;/code&gt;)

* &lt;code&gt;FLT_MIN&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DBL_MIN&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LDBL_MIN&lt;/code&gt; – (no greater than &lt;code&gt;1E-37&lt;/code&gt;)

The iso646.h header file is part of the C standard library. It was added to this library in a 1995 amendment to the C90 standard. It defines a number of macros which allow programmers to use C language bitwise and logical operators, which, without the header file, cannot be quickly or easily typed on some international and non-QWERTY keyboards.

The filename refers to the ISO646 standard, a 7-bit character set with a number of regional variations, some of which have accented characters in place of the punctuation marks used by C operators.

== The macros ==
The iso646.h header defines the following 11 macros as stated below:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-family:monospace; text-align:center;&quot;
|- style=&quot;font-family:sans-serif;&quot;
! style=&quot;width:10em;&quot; | Macro 
! style=&quot;width:10em;&quot; | Defined as
|-
| and    || &amp;&amp;
|-
| and_eq || &amp;=
|-
| bitand || &amp;
|-
| bitor  || &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
| compl  || ~
|-
| not    || &lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
| not_eq || &lt;nowiki&gt;!=&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
| or     || &lt;nowiki&gt;||&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
| or_eq  || &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;=
|-
| xor    || ^
|-
| xor_eq || ^=
|}

== C++ ==
These identifiers are operator keywords in the ISO C++ programming language and do not require the inclusion of a header file. For consistency, the C++98 standard provides the header &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ciso646&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. However the latter file has no effect, being empty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 0-596-00298-X | title = C++ in a Nutshell | last = Lischner | first = Ray | page = 212 | publisher = O'Reilly Media | year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''limits.h''' includes definitions of the characteristics of common variable types. The values are implementation specific, but may not be of lower magnitude than certain specified values in a conforming C implementation.

The C99 standard also specifies the &lt;code&gt;stdint.h&lt;/code&gt; file, which provides names and limits for explicitly-sized platform-independent integer datatypes (e.g. &lt;code&gt;int32_t&lt;/code&gt; for a 32-bit signed integer).
==Member constants==
The &quot;minimum-magnitude value&quot; column is the minimum possible magnitude for this constant as specified by the standard. In particular, &lt;code&gt;_MIN&lt;/code&gt; values represent the minimum magnitude representable in the rarely-used one's complement and sign-magnitude forms. Most implementations will have larger magnitudes for at least some of these numbers. For instance:
*Two's complement implementations have &lt;code&gt;SCHAR_MIN&lt;/code&gt; equal to −128 (and similarly for all other &lt;code&gt;_MIN&lt;/code&gt; values).
*32-bit implementations will set &lt;code&gt;INT_MAX&lt;/code&gt; equal to +2,147,483,647 (and likewise for &lt;code&gt;INT_MIN&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;UINT_MAX&lt;/code&gt;)
*Unicode-supporting implementations will set &lt;code&gt;MB_LEN_MAX&lt;/code&gt; to 4 or more.
*Many DSPs have &lt;code&gt;CHAR_BIT&lt;/code&gt; equal to 16 or more[http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/intrinsic-types.html#faq-26.4][http://home.att.net/~jackklein/c/inttypes.html#char].

{{lowercase|title=stdbool.h}}
The header '''stdbool.h''' in the [[C Standard Library]] for the [[C programming language]] contains four macros for a [[Boolean data type]]. This header was introduced in [[C99]].

The macros as defined in the ISO C standard are :

* '''bool''' which expands to _Bool
* '''true''' which expands to 1
* '''false''' which expands to 0
* '''__bool_true_false_are_defined''' which expands to 1

which can be used in an example

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;

int main(void) {
    bool keep_going = true;  // Could also be `bool keep_going = 1;`
    while(keep_going) {
        printf(&quot;This will run as long as keep_going is true.\n&quot;);
        keep_going = false;    // Could also be `keep_going = 0;`
    }
    printf(&quot;Stopping!\n&quot;);
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
which will output
 This will run as long as keep_going is true.
 Stopping!

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''stdint.h''' is a [[C++ Programming#.h|header file]] in the [[C Programming/Standard libraries|C standard library]] introduced in the [[C Programming/C Reference|C99 standard library]] section 7.18 to allow programmers to write more portable code by providing a set of typedefs that specify exact-width integer types, together with the defined minimum and maximum allowable values for each type, using macros&lt;ref name=pubs /&gt; . This header is particularly useful for [[Embedded Systems/C Programming|embedded programming]] which often involves considerable manipulation of hardware specific I/O [[Electronics/Registers|registers]] requiring integer data of fixed widths, specific locations and exact alignments. '''stdint.h (for C or C++)''', and '''cstdint (for C++)''' can be downloaded or quickly created if they are not provided.

The naming convention for exact-width integer types is '''int''N''_t''' for [[C Programming/Reference Tables#Table of Data Types|signed int]] and '''uint''N''_t''' for [[C Programming/Reference Tables#Table of Data Types|unsigned int]] &lt;ref name=pubs /&gt; . For example &lt;code&gt;int8_t&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;uint64_t&lt;/code&gt; amongst others could be declared together with defining their corresponding ranges &lt;code&gt;INT8_MIN&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;INT8_MAX&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; (zero) to &lt;code&gt;UINT64_MAX&lt;/code&gt;; again using a similar but upper case naming convention. In addition stdint.h defines limits of integer types capable of holding object pointers such as &lt;code&gt;UINTPTR_MAX&lt;/code&gt;, the value of which depends on the processor and its address range&lt;ref name=pubs /&gt;.

The exact-width types and their corresponding ranges are only included in that header if they exist for that specific compiler/processor. Note that even on the same processor, two different compiler implementations can differ. The use of &lt;code&gt;#if&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;#ifdef&lt;/code&gt; would allow the inclusion or exclusion of types by the use of compilers preprocessor so that the correct exact-width set is selected for a compiler and its processor target.

The related include file &lt;code&gt;&lt;[[C Programming/C Reference/limits.h|limits.h]]&gt;&lt;/code&gt; provides macros values for the range limits of common integer variable types.  In '''C''' &lt;code&gt;&lt;[[C Programming/C Reference/limits.h|limits.h]]&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is already included in &lt;code&gt;&lt;stdint.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, but in contrast to &lt;code&gt;&lt;stdint.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which is implementation independent; all maximum and minimum integer values defined in &lt;code&gt;&lt;[[C Programming/C Reference/limits.h|limits.h]]&gt;&lt;/code&gt; are compiler implementation specific.  For example a compiler generating 32 bit executables will define LONG_MIN as −2,147,483,648 [−2&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;] however for 64 bit processors targets, LONG_MIN can be  −9,223,372,036,854,775,808 [−2&lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;].

==Background==
===Corresponding integer types===
The C standard has a notion of &quot;corresponding integer types&quot;. Informally, what this means is for any integer type T:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
typedef   signed T A;
typedef unsigned T B;
&lt;/source&gt;
the type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and the type &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; are said to be '''corresponding integer types''' (note: &lt;code&gt;typedef&lt;/code&gt; doesn't create a new type, it creates a new identifier as a synonym for the given type). This is important for two reasons:

*corresponding types are friendly to [[Aliasing (computing)|aliasing]] and [[Type punning|type puns]]
*corresponding types have a similar object representation

Both of these combined require code like:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
A a = 1;
B b = 1;
*(B*)&amp;a = 0;
*(A*)&amp;b = 0;
&lt;/source&gt;
to have defined behavior by the standard (as opposed to being undefined in the general case). There are many caveats to how far you can push this, so it's important to actually read the C standard to see what's legal or not (the bulk of this has to deal with padding bits and out of range representations).

===Representation===
The [[C99]] standard elaborated the difference between value representations and object representations.

The object representation of an integer consists of 0 or more padding bits, 1 or more value bits&lt;ref name = &quot;pubs&quot;&gt;technically, it actually allows 0 or more value bits, but the only way you can construct this is with a single-bit [[bit-field]] of a signed integer&lt;/ref&gt;, and either 0 or 1 [[sign bit]]s (this doesn't count as a value bit) depending on the [[signedness]] of the integer type.

The value representation is a conceptual representation of an integer. The value representation ignores any padding bits and does a (possible) rearrangement to the bits so that the integer is ordered sequentially from [[most significant bit|most significant value bit]] to [[least significant bit|least significant value bit]]. Most programmers deal with this representation because it allows them easily to write portable code by only dealing with [[−0]] and out of range values as opposed to both of those in addition to tricky aliasing rules and trap representations if they choose to deal with the object representation directly.
&lt;!-- TODO: talk about precession, width, padding, &lt;code&gt;sizeof&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;CODE&gt;CHAR_BIT&lt;/CODE&gt;. --&gt;

====Signed representation====
The C standard allows for only three [[signed integer representations]] specified by the compiler writer:

*[[sign and magnitude]]
*[[one's complement]]
*[[two's complement]] (the most widely used)

==Integer types==

The types &lt;code&gt;''&amp;lt;something&amp;gt;''_t&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;u''&amp;lt;something&amp;gt;''_t&lt;/code&gt; are required to be corresponding signed and unsigned integer types. For the types that are marked optional, an implementation must either define both &lt;code&gt;''&amp;lt;something&amp;gt;''_t&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;u''&amp;lt;something&amp;gt;''_t&lt;/code&gt; or neither of the two. The limits of these types shall be defined with macros with a similar name in the same fashion as described below.

If a type is of the form &lt;code&gt;[u]''&amp;lt;something&amp;gt;N''_t&lt;/code&gt; (or similarly for a preprocessor define), '''N''' must be a positive decimal integer with no leading 0's.

===Exact-width integer types ===

These are of the form &lt;code&gt;int''N''_t&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;uint''N''_t&lt;/code&gt;. Both types must be represented by exactly '''N''' bits with no padding bits. &lt;code&gt;int''N''_t&lt;/code&gt; must be encoded as a [[two's complement]] signed integer and &lt;code&gt;uint''N''_t&lt;/code&gt; as an unsigned integer. These types are optional unless the implementation supports types with widths of 8, 16, 32 or 64, then it shall typedef them to the corresponding types with corresponding '''N'''. Any other '''N''' is optional&lt;ref name=pubs /&gt; .

The limits of these types are defined with macros with the following formats:
* &lt;code&gt;INT''N''_MAX&lt;/code&gt; is the maximum value (2&lt;sup&gt;''N''−1&lt;/sup&gt; − 1) of the signed version of int'''N'''_t.
* &lt;code&gt;INT''N''_MIN&lt;/code&gt; is the minimum value (−2&lt;sup&gt;''N''−1&lt;/sup&gt;) of the signed version of int'''N'''_t.
* &lt;code&gt;UINT''N''_MAX&lt;/code&gt; is the maximum value (2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; – 1) of the unsigned version of uint'''N'''_t.

===Minimum-width integer types===

These are of the form &lt;code&gt;int_least'''N'''_t&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;uint_least'''N'''_t&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;int_least'''N'''_t&lt;/code&gt; is a signed integer and &lt;code&gt;uint_least''N''_t&lt;/code&gt; is an unsigned integer&lt;ref name=pubs /&gt; .

The standard mandates that these have widths greater than or equal to '''N''', and that no smaller type with the same signedness has N or more bits.  For example, if a system provided only a &lt;code&gt;uint32_t&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;uint64_t&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;uint_least16_t&lt;/code&gt; must be equivalent to &lt;code&gt;uint32_t&lt;/code&gt;.

An implementation is required to define these for the following '''N''': 8, 16, 32, 64. Any other '''N''' is optional.

The limits of these types are defined with macros with the following formats:
* &lt;code&gt;INT_LEAST''N''_MAX&lt;/code&gt; is the maximum value (2&lt;sup&gt;''N''−1&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 or greater) of the signed version of &lt;code&gt;int_least'''N'''_t&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;INT_LEAST''N''_MIN&lt;/code&gt; is the minimum value (−2&lt;sup&gt;''N''−1&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 or less) of the signed version of &lt;code&gt;int_least'''N'''_t&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;UINT_LEAST''N''_MAX&lt;/code&gt; is the maximum value (2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 or greater) of the unsigned version of &lt;code&gt;uint_least'''N'''_t&lt;/code&gt; .

stdint.h should also define macros which will convert constant [[decimal]], [[octal]] or [[hexadecimal]] value which are guaranteed to be suitable for the corresponding types and to be usable with the [[C_preprocessor#Conditional_compilation|&lt;code&gt;#if&lt;/code&gt;]]:
* &lt;code&gt;INT''N''_C(''value'')&lt;/code&gt; is substituted for a value suitable for &lt;code&gt;int_least'''N'''_t&lt;/code&gt;. For example if &lt;code&gt;int_least64_t&lt;/code&gt; is &quot;typedefed&quot; to &lt;code&gt;signed long long int&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;INT64_C(123)&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to &lt;code&gt;123LL&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;UINT''N''_C(''value'')&lt;/code&gt; is substituted for a value suitable for &lt;code&gt;uint_least'''N'''_t&lt;/code&gt;.

===Fastest minimum-width integer types===

These are of the form &lt;code&gt;int_fast'''N'''_t&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;uint_fast'''N'''_t&lt;/code&gt;.

The standard does not mandate anything about these types except that their widths must be greater than or equal to '''N'''. It also leaves it up to the implementor to decide what it means to be a &quot;fast&quot; integer type.

An implementation is required to define these for the following '''N''': 8, 16, 32, 64&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tuxgraphics.org/common/src2/article09043/avr-libc-user-manual-1.6.4/group__avr__stdint.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

The limits of these types are defined with macros with the following formats:
* &lt;code&gt;INT_FAST''N''_MAX&lt;/code&gt; is the maximum value (2&lt;sup&gt;''N''−1&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 or greater) of the signed version of &lt;code&gt;int_fast'''N'''_t&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;INT_FAST''N''_MIN&lt;/code&gt; is the minimum value (−2&lt;sup&gt;''N''−1&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 or less) of the signed version of &lt;code&gt;int_fast'''N'''_t&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;UINT_FAST''N''_MAX&lt;/code&gt; is the maximum value (2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 or greater) of the unsigned version of &lt;code&gt;uint_fast'''N'''_t&lt;/code&gt; &lt;ref name=pubs /&gt; .

===Integers wide enough to hold pointers===

&lt;code&gt;intptr_t&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;uintptr_t&lt;/code&gt; is a signed and unsigned integer which are guaranteed to hold the value of a pointer. These two types are optional.

The limits of these types are defined with the following macros:
* &lt;code&gt;INTPTR_MIN&lt;/code&gt; is the minimum value (−32,767 [−2&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; + 1] or less) of &lt;code&gt;intptr_t&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;INTPTR_MAX&lt;/code&gt; is the maximum value (32,767 [2&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; − 1] or greater) of &lt;code&gt;intptr_t&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;UINTPTR_MAX&lt;/code&gt; is the maximum value (65,535 [2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; − 1] or greater) of &lt;code&gt;uintptr_t&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt; http://linux.die.net/man/3/intptr_t &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Greatest-width integer types===
&lt;code&gt;intmax_t&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;uintmax_t&lt;/code&gt; is a signed and unsigned integer which are of the greatest supported width. They are in other words the integer types which have the greatest limits.

The limits of these types are defined with macros with the following formats:
* &lt;code&gt;INTMAX_MAX&lt;/code&gt; is the maximum value (9,223,372,036,854,775,807 [2&lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt; − 1] or greater) of the signed version of &lt;code&gt;intmax_t&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;INTMAX_MIN&lt;/code&gt; is the minimum value (−9,223,372,036,854,775,807 [−2&lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt; + 1] or less) of the signed version of &lt;code&gt;intmax_t&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;UINTMAX_MAX&lt;/code&gt; is the maximum value (18,446,744,073,709,551,615 [2&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt; − 1] or greater) of the unsigned version of &lt;code&gt;uintmax_t&lt;/code&gt;.

Macros which will convert constant decimal, octal or hexadecimal value which will suit the corresponding type are also defined:
* &lt;code&gt;INTMAX_C(''value'')&lt;/code&gt; is substituted for a value suitable for &lt;code&gt;intmax_t&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;UINTMAX_C(''value'')&lt;/code&gt; is substituted for a value suitable for &lt;code&gt;uintmax_t&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name=pubs /&gt; .

==Other integer limits==
* &lt;code&gt;PTRDIFF_MIN&lt;/code&gt; is the minimum value of &lt;code&gt;[[Stddef.h#Type_ptrdiff_t|ptrdiff_t]]&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;PTRDIFF_MAX&lt;/code&gt; is the maximum value of &lt;code&gt;ptrdiff_t&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;SIZE_MAX&lt;/code&gt; is the maximum value (2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 or greater) of &lt;code&gt;[[Stddef.h#Type_size_t|size_t]]&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;WCHAR_MIN&lt;/code&gt; is the minimum value of &lt;code&gt;[[Stddef.h#Type_wchar_t|wchar_t]]&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;WCHAR_MAX&lt;/code&gt; is the maximum value of &lt;code&gt;wchar_t&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;WINT_MIN&lt;/code&gt; is the minimum value of &lt;code&gt;wint_t&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;WINT_MAX&lt;/code&gt; is the maximum value of &lt;code&gt;wint_t&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;SIG_ATOMIC_MIN&lt;/code&gt; is the minimum value of &lt;code&gt;sig_atomic_t&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;SIG_ATOMIC_MAX&lt;/code&gt; is the maximum value of &lt;code&gt;sig_atomic_t&lt;/code&gt;.

==Criticisms and caveats==

*Some (non-conforming) implementations tack C99 support on top of a C89 runtime library.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} One of the consequences of this is that the new &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;scanf&lt;/code&gt; specifiers aren't recognized and will probably lead to something undefined. The typical ways of working around this are:
**The most common (and the most wrong) way is to use the &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;unsigned long&lt;/code&gt; types as an intermediate step and pass these types into &lt;code&gt;[[printf]]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;[[scanf]]&lt;/code&gt;. This works reasonably well for the exact, minimum, and fast integer types less than 32-bits but may cause trouble with &lt;code&gt;ptrdiff_t&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[[size_t]]&lt;/code&gt; and the types larger than 32-bits, typically on platforms that use 32-bit &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt;s and 64-bit pointers.
**Not using &lt;code&gt;scanf&lt;/code&gt; directly but manually reading in a buffer, calling &lt;code&gt;strto[i|u]max&lt;/code&gt;, and then converting it to the desired type. This doesn't help with printing out integers though.
**Using a 3rd-party &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;scanf&lt;/code&gt; library that is C99 compatible.
**Using the C99 standard printing format specifiers. PRId64 for example. These are declared in inttypes.h.

*The rules for integer rank and corresponding integer types may force implementers to choose the lesser of two evils in not supporting an integer type, making a bad compromise, or supporting an integer type a non-conforming way.
**For example, there are machines that either have special support for an extremely large signed integer register or an extremely large unsigned integer register without supporting the other type.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} An implementation can either choose not to expose this to a C implementation, synthesize a slow type as the corresponding integer type, synthesizing a weird corresponding integer type, or expose the integer to the programmer without setting it to the &lt;code&gt;[u]intmax_t&lt;/code&gt; types or synthesizing a corresponding integer type.

*The &lt;code&gt;[u]int'''N'''_t&lt;/code&gt; types are a compromise between the desire to have guaranteed two's complement integer types and the desire to have guaranteed types with no padding bits (as opposed to a more fine grained approach which would define more types). Because of the &quot;all or nothing&quot; approach to the &lt;code&gt;[u]int'''N'''_t&lt;/code&gt; types, an implementation might have to play the same sort of games described above depending on whether they care about speed, programmer convenience, or standards conformance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''swab''' is a function in the [[C programming language]] that copies one area of memory to another, but swaps adjacent bytes whilst it does so. As far as traceable, “swab” is a contraction of “swap byte”.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} It is not a standard [[C standard library|ISO C library]] function, but appears in the [[Single Unix Specification]] (SUS) and [[POSIX]].1-2001. These require that &lt;code&gt;swab&lt;/code&gt; be declared in [[unistd.h]]. On other platforms, it may be declared in [[stdlib.h]], if at all.

The &lt;code&gt;swab()&lt;/code&gt; function is useful for preparing blocks of data for further processing, in situations where the data blocks have been sent through a [[computer networking|network]] arranged in network byte order, and must be rearranged into native [[endianness|byte order]] (or vice versa). This deals specifically with data blocks that are composed of 2-[[byte]] (16-[[bit]]) [[Word (data type)|word]]s that must be rearranged so that they have the proper endianness appropriate for the local system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''complex.h''' is a header file that defines functionality for complex arithmetic.&lt;ref name=&quot;SUS&quot;&gt;{{man|bd|complex.h|SUS|complex arithmetic}}&lt;/ref&gt; These functions use the built-in type &lt;code&gt;complex&lt;/code&gt; which was introduced with the C99 revision of C.

This header should not be confused with the C++ standard library header &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;complex&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which implements complex numbers in a completely different way (as a template class, &lt;code&gt;complex&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;).

== Macro ==
Universal macro:
* complex - alias of _Complex
* _Complex_I - constant, which has type &quot;const float _Complex&quot; and value of imaginary unit I, I*I=-1

Defined only for `C99 Annex G`-compatible compiler modes - native support of imaginary types (it is very rare because Annex G is mathematically incorrect&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=PmNVAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=C99+Annex+G&amp; Dr. Dobb's journal: software tools for the professional programmer, Volume 27] &quot;many results in Annex G are pure invention and mathematically incorrect&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;):
* imaginary - alias of _Imaginary
* _Imaginary_I Expands to a constant expression of type const float _Imaginary with the value of the imaginary unit.

Universal alias of I:
* I - alias of _Imaginary_I if it is defined else - alias of _Complex_I 

Application may undefine complex, imaginary, and I macros if they interfere with internal values.

==Functions==
Each function declared in &lt;code&gt;complex.h&lt;/code&gt; has three versions, each of which works with a different floating-point type (&lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;long{{nbsp}}double&lt;/code&gt;). Only the &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; version of each function is listed here; to use the &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;long{{nbsp}}double&lt;/code&gt;) version, append an &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; (or an &lt;code&gt;l&lt;code&gt;, respectively) to the function's name.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The header '''&lt;tt&gt;ctype.h&lt;/tt&gt;''' in the ANSI C Standard Library for the C programming language contains declarations for character classification functions.

== History ==

Early toolsmiths writing in C under Unix began developing idioms at a rapid rate to classify characters into different types. For example, in the ASCI] character set, the following test identifies a letter:

 &lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;if ('A' &lt;= c &amp;&amp; c &lt;= 'Z' || 'a' &lt;= c &amp;&amp; c &lt;= 'z')&lt;/source&gt;

However, this idiom does ''not necessarily'' work for other character sets such as EBCDIC.

Pretty soon, programs became thick with tests such as the one above, or worse, tests almost like the one above. A programmer can write the same idiom several different ways, which slows comprehension and increases the chance for errors.

Before long, the idioms were replaced by the functions in &lt;tt&gt;&lt;ctype.h&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Implementation ==

Unlike the above example, the character classification routines are not written as comparison tests. In most C libraries, they are written as static table lookups instead of macros or functions.

For example, an array of 256 eight-bit integers, arranged as bitfields, is created, where each bit corresponds to a particular property of the character, e.g., isdigit, isalpha. If the lowest-order bit of the integers corresponds to the isdigit property, the code could be written thus:

 &lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#define isdigit(x) (TABLE[x] &amp; 1)&lt;/source&gt;

Early versions of Linux used a potentially faulty method similar to the first code sample:

 &lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#define isdigit(x) ((x) &gt;= '0' &amp;&amp; (x) &lt;= '9')&lt;/source&gt;

This can cause problems if &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; has a side effect---for instance, if one calls &lt;tt&gt;isdigit(x++)&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;isdigit(run_some_program())&lt;/tt&gt;. It would not be immediately evident that the argument to &lt;tt&gt;isdigit&lt;/tt&gt; is being evaluated twice. For this reason, the table-based approach is generally used.

== The contents of &lt;ctype.h&gt; ==

The &lt;ctype.h&gt; contains prototypes for a dozen character classification functions. All of these functions except &lt;code&gt;isdigit&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;isxdigit&lt;/code&gt; are locale-specific; their behavior may change if the locale changes.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Tests || In the form &lt;code&gt;int isfunc(int);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;Return a nonzero number for true and zero for false.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;isalnum&lt;/code&gt; || test for alphanumeric character
|-
|&lt;code&gt;isalpha&lt;/code&gt; || test for alphabetic character
|-
|&lt;code&gt;isblank&lt;/code&gt; || test for blank character (new in C99)
|-
|&lt;code&gt;iscntrl&lt;/code&gt; || test for control character
|-
|&lt;code&gt;isdigit&lt;/code&gt; || test for digit. Not locale-specific.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;isgraph&lt;/code&gt; || test for graphic character, excluding the space character.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;islower&lt;/code&gt; || test for lowercase character
|-
|&lt;code&gt;isprint&lt;/code&gt; || test for printable character, including the space character.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;ispunct&lt;/code&gt; || test for punctuation character
|-
|&lt;code&gt;isspace&lt;/code&gt; || test for any whitespace character
|-
|&lt;code&gt;isupper&lt;/code&gt; || test for uppercase character
|-
|&lt;code&gt;isxdigit&lt;/code&gt; || test for hexadecimal digit. Not locale-specific.
|-
! Character conversion || in the form &lt;code&gt;int tofunc(int);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;Return the converted character unless it is not alphabetic.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;tolower&lt;/code&gt; || convert character to lowercase
|-
|&lt;code&gt;toupper&lt;/code&gt; || convert character to uppercase
|}

The Single Unix Specification Version 3 adds functions similar to the above:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;isascii&lt;/code&gt; || test that the parameter is between 0 and 127
|-
|&lt;code&gt;toascii&lt;/code&gt; || converts a character to ASCII
|}

== Incorrect usage ==
The standard states (§7.4-1):
:''In all cases the argument is an '''int''', the value of which shall be representable as an '''unsigned char''' or shall equal the value of the macro '''EOF'''. If the argument has any other value, the behavior is undefined.''

Unfortunately many programmers forget that a '''char''' type may be either signed or unsigned, depending on the implementation. If the '''char''' types are signed, the implicit conversion from '''char''' to '''int''' may generate negative values, resulting in undefined behavior. That usually means that if the argument is used as an index to a lookup table, it will access an area outside of the correct table, and may even crash the program.

The correct way to use '''char''' arguments is to first cast them to '''unsigned char''' after checking for EOF condition.

The &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;-type values returned by &lt;code&gt;getchar&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;getc&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;fgetc&lt;/code&gt; are guaranteed to be in the range of '''unsigned char''' (or '''EOF'''), and thus no cast is needed in these cases.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''inttypes.h''' file is a C [[C++ Programming#.h|header file]] that is part of the [[C Programming/Standard libraries|C standard library]] and [[C++ Programming/Code/API|API]].  It was added with the 1999 version of the ISO C standard (known as C99).  It [[C Programming/Preprocessor#include|includes]] the [[C Programming/C Reference/stdint.h|stdint.h]] header and defines a number of [[C Programming/Preprocessor#macros|macros]] for using it with the [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library|printf]] and [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library|scanf]] family of functions, as well as functions for working with the &lt;code&gt;intmax_t&lt;/code&gt; type.

==Naming Convention and format specifiers for Macros==
The macros defined in inttypes.h follow a regular pattern to simplify usage. The pattern followed is as follows &lt;ref name=&quot;man&quot;&gt;http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/gutsy/man7/inttypes.h.7posix.html&lt;/ref&gt; :

===== First three characters =====
* PRI for output format ([[C Programming/Procedures and functions/printf|printf]], [[C Programming/C Reference/stdio.h/fwprintf|fwprintf]], [[c Programming/C Reference/stdio.h/wprintf|wprintf]],  etc.)
* SCN for input format ([[c Programming/C Reference/stdio.h/scanf|scanf]], fwscanf, etc.)

===== Fourth character =====
* d for [[Elementary School Mathematics/Number System and Place Value#The Decimal System|decimal]] formatting
* x for [[C++ Programming/Chapter Learning the Basics#Hexadecimal Number System|hexadecimal]] formatting
* o for [[C++ Programming/Chapter Learning the Basics#The Octal Number System|octal]] formatting
* u for [[C Programming/Reference Tables#Table of Data Types|unsigned int]] formatting
* i for [[C Programming/Reference Tables#Table of Data Types|int]]eger formatting

===== Remaining Characters =====
* N for N [[The Computer Revolution/Databases/basic structure|bit]] size assignment to the data type (Eg. 32 for 32-bit size for [[C Programming/Reference Tables#Table of Data Types|int]]eger, 16 for 16-bit size for unsigned int and so on)
* PTR for [[Polymorphic Data Structures in C/Pointers|pointer]]
* MAX for maximum supported bit size
* FAST, whose meaning is not clearly defined and is left to the implementation to decide what is meant by a &quot;fast&quot; integer data type.

== Syntaxes ==
The following table gives syntax used for various data types listed in inttypes.h&lt;ref&gt;http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/integer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://linux.die.net/man/3/int64_t&lt;/ref&gt;:

==Rationale==
The difference in processing speeds in different processors like 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit systems, called for a uniform size for various data types. ISO/IEC 9899:1990 specified that the language should support basic data types like char, int, short and long but did not restrict the minimum or maximum size for these data types, except that int be at least 16-bits long and long be 32-bits long.

In 16-bit systems, most implementations assigned 8, 16, 16 and 32 bits for char, int, short and long data types, respectively. In 32-bit systems, it was 8, 32, 16 and 32 bits for char, int, short and long data types&lt;ref name=&quot;man&quot;/&gt;. The difference in size of int caused problems to users who migrated from one system to another.

The main purpose of including this header file is to restrict, or in other words, limit the exact size of int data type to a particular value(may be 16 bits or 32 bits)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Open Group Specifications Issue 6|title=Application Usage and Rationale|url=http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009604599/basedefs/inttypes.h.html|publisher=The IEEE and The Open Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It can also be used to limit the size of data type modifiers like unsigned int and signed int to specific values by using the macros listed in the header file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Open Group Specifications Issue 6|title=Application Usage and Rationale|url=http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009604599/basedefs/inttypes.h.html|publisher=The IEEE and The Open Group Base|accessdate=14 September, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the C programming language , &lt;code&gt;'''unistd.h'''&lt;/code&gt; is the name of the header file that provides access to the POSIX operating system API. It is defined by the POSIX.1 standard, the base of the Single Unix Specification, and should therefore be available in any conforming (or quasi-conforming) operating system/compiler (all official versions of Unix, including Mac OS X, Linux, etc.).

On Unix-like systems, the interface defined by &lt;code&gt;unistd.h&lt;/code&gt; is typically made up largely of system call wrapper functions such as &lt;code&gt;fork&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pipe&lt;/code&gt; and I/O primitives (&lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;close&lt;/code&gt;, etc.).

Unix compatibility layers as Cygwin and MinGW also provide their own versions of unistd.h. In fact, those systems provide it along with the translation libraries that implement its functions in terms of Win32 functions. For example, in Cygwin, a header file can be found in &lt;code&gt;/usr/include&lt;/code&gt; that sub-includes a file of the same name in &lt;code&gt;/usr/include/sys&lt;/code&gt;. Not everything is defined in there but some definitions are done by references to the GNU C standard library headers (like stddef.h) which provide the type size_t and many more. Thus, unistd.h is only a generically defined adaptive layer that might be based upon already existing system and compiler specific definitions. This has the general advantage of not having a possibly concurrent set of header file defined, but one that is built upon the same root which, for this reason, will raise much fewer concerns in combined usage cases.

|&lt;code&gt;int '''[[C Programming/POSIX Reference/sys/stat.h/stat|stat]]''' (const char *filename, struct stat *buf)&lt;/code&gt; || The [[C Programming/POSIX Reference/sys/stat.h/stat|stat]] function returns information about the attributes of the file named by &lt;code&gt;filename&lt;/code&gt; in the structure pointed to by &lt;code&gt;buf&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;filename&lt;/code&gt; is the name of a symbolic link, the attributes you get describe the file that the link points to. If the link points to a nonexistent file name, then stat fails reporting a nonexistent file. The return value is 0 if the operation is successful, or -1 on failure. When the sources are compiled with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64 this function is in fact stat64 since the LFS interface transparently replaces the normal implementation.

&lt;code&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt; Errors: ENOENT means the file named by &lt;code&gt;filename&lt;/code&gt; doesn't exist.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;int '''stat64''' (const char *filename, struct stat64 *buf)&lt;/code&gt; || This function is similar to stat but it is also able to work on files larger than 2^31 bytes on 32-bit systems. To be able to do this the result is stored in a variable of type struct stat64 to which &lt;code&gt;buf&lt;/code&gt; must point. When the sources are compiled with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64 this function is available under the name stat and so transparently replaces the interface for small files on 32-bit machines. 

&lt;code&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt; Errors: ENOENT means the file named by &lt;code&gt;filename&lt;/code&gt; doesn't exist.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;int '''fstat''' (int filedes, struct stat *buf)&lt;/code&gt; || The fstat function is like stat, except that it takes an open file descriptor (&lt;code&gt;filedes&lt;/code&gt;)as an argument instead of a file name. Like stat, fstat returns 0 on success and -1 on failure. When the sources are compiled with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64 this function is in fact fstat64 since the LFS interface transparently replaces the normal implementation. 

&lt;code&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt; Errors: EBADF means the &lt;code&gt;filedes&lt;/code&gt; argument is nos a valid file descriptor.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;int '''fstat64''' (int filedes, struct stat64 *buf)&lt;/code&gt; || This function is similar to fstat but is able to work on large files on 32-bit platforms. For large files the file descriptor filedes should be obtained by open64 or creat64. The &lt;code&gt;buf&lt;/code&gt; pointer points to a variable of type struct stat64 which is able to represent the larger values. When the sources are compiled with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64 this function is available under the name fstat and so transparently replaces the interface for small files on 32-bit machines. 

&lt;code&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt; Errors: EBADF means the &lt;code&gt;filedes&lt;/code&gt; argument is nos a valid file descriptor.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;int '''lstat''' (const char *filename, struct stat *buf)&lt;/code&gt; || The lstat function is like stat, except that it does not follow symbolic links. If &lt;code&gt;filename&lt;/code&gt; is the name of a symbolic link, lstat returns information about the link itself; otherwise lstat works like stat. See Symbolic Links. When the sources are compiled with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64 this function is in fact lstat64 since the LFS interface transparently replaces the normal implementation.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;int '''lstat64''' (const char *filename, struct stat64 *buf)&lt;/code&gt; || The lstat function is like stat, except that it does not follow symbolic links. If &lt;code&gt;filename&lt;/code&gt; is the name of a symbolic link, lstat returns information about the link itself; otherwise lstat works like stat. See Symbolic Links. When the sources are compiled with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64 this function is in fact lstat64 since the LFS interface transparently replaces the normal implementation.

The set-group-ID bit &lt;code&gt;(S_ISGID)&lt;/code&gt; has several special uses.  For a directory it indicates that BSD semantics is to be used for that directory: files created there inherit their group ID from the directory, not from the effective group  ID  of the  creating  process, and directories created there will also get the &lt;code&gt;S_ISGID&lt;/code&gt; bit set.  For a file that does not have the group execution bit &lt;code&gt;(S_IXGRP)&lt;/code&gt; set, the set-group-ID bit indicates mandatory file/record locking. The sticky bit &lt;code&gt;(S_ISVTX)&lt;/code&gt; on a directory means that a file in that directory can be renamed or deleted only by the owner of the file, by the owner of the directory, and by a privileged process.

POSIX  does  not describe the &lt;code&gt;S_IFMT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;S_IFSOCK&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;S_IFLNK&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;S_IFREG&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;S_IFBLK&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;S_IFDIR&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;S_IFCHR&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;S_IFIFO&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;S_ISVTX&lt;/code&gt; bits, but instead demands the use of the macros &lt;code&gt;S_ISDIR()&lt;/code&gt;, etc.  The &lt;code&gt;S_ISLNK()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;S_ISSOCK()&lt;/code&gt; macros are not in POSIX.1-1996, but both are present in POSIX.1-2001; the former is from SVID 4, the latter from SUSv2.

== Member types==
Data types defined in the &lt;code&gt;&lt;sys/stat.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt; header include:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
struct stat {
  dev_t     st_dev;     /* ID of device containing file */
  ino_t     st_ino;     /* inode number */
  mode_t    st_mode;    /* protection */
  nlink_t   st_nlink;   /* number of hard links */

  time_t    st_mtime;   /* time of last modification */
  time_t    st_ctime;   /* time of last status change */
};
&lt;/source&gt;

==Example==

A short example of &lt;sys/stat.h&gt; usage is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/**************************************************************
 abstract ls meaning
 **************************************************************/
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;errno.h&gt;

int            main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  struct stat  file_stat;

  while (argc-- &gt; 1)
    {
      if (lstat(argv[argc], &amp;file_stat) == -1)
        fprintf(stderr, &quot;%s\n&quot;, strerror(errno));
      else
        {
          fprintf(stdout, &quot;Links\tUid\tGid\tSize\tName\n&quot;);
          fprintf(stdout, &quot;%u\t%u\t%u\t%u\t%s\n&quot;, file_stat.st_nlink,
                  file_stat.st_uid, file_stat.st_gid, file_stat.st_size,
                  argv[argc]);
        }
    }
  return 0;
}

&lt;/source&gt;

Put the source in a file (main.c) and compile this:
  gcc main.c -o test

Now, to run type:
  ./test main.c
  ./test *

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''dirent.h''' is the header in the [[C POSIX library]] for the [[C programming language]] that contains constructs that facilitate directory traversing. The function is not part of the C standard, but is considered &quot;pseudo-standard&quot; and is usually portable between platforms.

== Functions ==

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Name||Notes
|-
|&lt;code&gt;int '''closedir'''(DIR* dirp)&lt;/code&gt; || Closes the directory stream referred to by &lt;code&gt;dirp&lt;/code&gt;. Upon return, &lt;code&gt;dirp&lt;/code&gt; may no longer point to an accessible object of the type DIR. If a file descriptor is used to implement type DIR, that file descriptor will be closed. Upon successful completion, closedir() returns 0. Otherwise, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error. 

&lt;code&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt; Errors: EBADF means &lt;code&gt;dirp&lt;/code&gt; does not refer to an open directory stream, EINTR means the function was interrupted by a signal.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;DIR* '''opendir'''(const char* dirname)&lt;/code&gt; || Opens a directory stream corresponding to the directory named by &lt;code&gt;dirname&lt;/code&gt;. The directory stream is positioned at the first entry. If the type DIR is implemented using a file descriptor, applications will only be able to open up to a total of &lt;code&gt;OPEN_MAX&lt;/code&gt; files and directories. Upon successful completion, opendir() returns a pointer to an object of type DIR. Otherwise, a null pointer is returned and errno is set to indicate the error. 

&lt;code&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt; Errors: EACCES means the search permission is denied for the component of the path prefix of dirname or read permission is denied for dirname. ELOOP means too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving path. ENAMETOOLONG means the length of the dirname argument exceeds PATH_MAX, or a pathname component is longer than NAME_MAX. ENOENT means a component of dirname does not name an existing directory or dirname is an empty string. ENOTDIR means a component of dirname is not a directory. EMFILE means OPEN_MAX file descriptors are currently open in the calling process. ENAMETOOLONG means the pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate result whose length exceeds PATH_MAX. ENFILE means there are too many files are currently open in the system.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;struct dirent* '''readdir'''(DIR* dirp)&lt;/code&gt; || Returns a pointer to a structure representing the directory entry at the current position in the directory stream specified by the argument &lt;code&gt;dirp&lt;/code&gt;, and positions the directory stream at the next entry. It returns a null pointer upon reaching the end of the directory stream. If entries for dot or dot-dot exist, one entry will be returned for dot and one entry will be returned for dot-dot; otherwise they will not be returned. When an error is encountered, a null pointer is returned and errno is set to indicate the error. When the end of the directory is encountered, a null pointer is returned and errno is not changed.

The memory location pointed to by the return value is managed by the library and may change on subsequent calls to readdir. It should not be [[Free_(programming)|free]]'d by the user.

&lt;code&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt; Errors: EOVERFLOW means one of the values in the structure to be returned cannot be represented correctly. EBADF means &lt;code&gt;dirp&lt;/code&gt; does not refer to an open directory stream. ENOENT means the current position of the directory stream is invalid.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;int '''readdir_r'''(DIR* dirp, struct dirent* entry, struct dirent** result)&lt;/code&gt; || Initialises &lt;code&gt;entry&lt;/code&gt; to represent the directory entry at the current position in &lt;code&gt;dirp&lt;/code&gt;, store a pointer to this structure at the location referenced by &lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt;, and positions the directory stream at the next entry. The storage pointed to by &lt;code&gt;entry&lt;/code&gt; will be large enough for a dirent with an array of char d_name member containing at least &lt;code&gt;NAME_MAX&lt;/code&gt; plus one elements. On successful return, the pointer returned at *result will have the same value as the argument entry. Upon reaching the end of the directory stream, this pointer will have the value NULL. 

&lt;code&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt; Errors: EBADF means &lt;code&gt;dirp&lt;/code&gt; does not refer to an open directory stream.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;void '''rewinddir'''(DIR* dirp)&lt;/code&gt; || Resets the position of the directory stream to which dirp refers to the beginning of the directory. It also causes the directory stream to refer to the current state of the corresponding directory, as a call to opendir() would have done. If dirp does not refer to a directory stream, the effect is undefined.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;void '''seekdir'''(DIR* dirp, long int loc)&lt;/code&gt; || Sets the position of the next readdir() operation on the directory stream specified by dirp to the position specified by loc. The value of loc should have been returned from an earlier call to telldir(). The new position reverts to the one associated with the directory stream when telldir() was performed. If the value of loc was not obtained from an earlier call to telldir() or if a call to rewinddir() occurred between the call to telldir() and the call to seekdir(), the results of subsequent calls to readdir() are unspecified.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;long int '''telldir'''(DIR* dirp)&lt;/code&gt; || Obtains the current location associated with the directory stream specified by dirp. If the most recent operation on the directory stream was a seekdir(), the directory position returned from the telldir() is the same as that supplied as a loc argument for seekdir(). Upon successful completion, telldir() returns the current location of the specified directory stream.

== Member constants ==
Constants defined in the &lt;code&gt;stdio.h&lt;/code&gt; header include:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Name !! Notes
|-
|&lt;code&gt;NAME_MAX&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;FILENAME_MAX&lt;/code&gt;) || The maximum length of the char array &lt;code&gt;d_name&lt;/code&gt;.
|}

== Member types==
Data types defined in the &lt;code&gt;dirent.h&lt;/code&gt; header include:
* &lt;code&gt;DIR&lt;/code&gt; - A structure representing a directory stream. Its structure is not defined by POSIX, and is usually opaque to users.

* &lt;code&gt;struct dirent&lt;/code&gt; - A structure with the following members:
:* &lt;code&gt;ino_t d_ino&lt;/code&gt; - file serial number
:* &lt;code&gt;char d_name[]&lt;/code&gt; - name of entry (will not exceed a size of NAME_MAX)

* In addition, &lt;code&gt;struct dirent&lt;/code&gt; may contain the following members, depending on the platform:
:* &lt;code&gt;off_t d_off&lt;/code&gt; - file offset
:* &lt;code&gt;unsigned short int d_reclen&lt;/code&gt; - length of the dirent record
:* &lt;code&gt;unsigned short int d_namlen&lt;/code&gt; - length of name
:* &lt;code&gt;unsigned int d_type&lt;/code&gt; - type of file

==Standardization==
dirent.h is included in most C/C++ libraries for the PC architecture.

dirent.h is known to be included in the following compilers:
* Turbo C++ (DOS)
* GCC (Cross-platform)
* MinGW (a Microsoft Windows version of GCC)
* Borland C++ Builder (Microsoft Windows)

Microsoft Visual C++ does '''not''' include dirent.h

==Example==

A short example of dirent.h usage is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/**************************************************************
 * A simpler and shorter implementation of ls(1)
 * ls(1) is very similar to the DIR command on DOS and Windows.
 **************************************************************/
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;dirent.h&gt;

int listdir(const char *path) {
  struct dirent *entry;
  DIR *dp;

  dp = opendir(path);
  if (dp == NULL) {
    perror(&quot;opendir&quot;);
    return -1;
  }

  while((entry = readdir(dp)))
    puts(entry-&gt;d_name);

  closedir(dp);
  return 0;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int counter = 1;

  if (argc == 1)
	listdir(&quot;.&quot;);

  while (++counter &lt;= argc) {
    printf(&quot;\nListing %s...\n&quot;, argv[counter-1]);
    listdir(argv[counter-1]);
  }

  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Put the source in a file (listdir.c) and compile ( in a Linux shell ) like this:
 gcc listdir.c -o listdir
or like this:
 gcc listdir.c -o listdir.exe
in a Windows/DOS environment.

Now, to run ( in a Linux shell ) type:
  ./listdir
or type:
  listdir.exe
in a Windows/DOS shell.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[computing]], '''locale.h''' is a [[C (programming language)|C]] programming language [[header file]], used for purposes of [[Internationalization and localization|localization]]. The header provides two key functions: &lt;code&gt;localeconv&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;setlocale&lt;/code&gt;. The former provides access to the current locale, while the latter allows one to set the current locale. The header also defines the [[C++ classes|struct]] &lt;code&gt;lconv&lt;/code&gt;, which stores information about a given locale, including the local preference for the display of numbers and currency.

'''atof''' is a function in the [[C programming language]] that converts a string into a [[floating point]] numerical representation. &lt;code&gt;atof&lt;/code&gt; stands for ''ASCII to float''. It is included in the [[C standard library]] [[header file]] &lt;code&gt;[[stdlib.h]]&lt;/code&gt;. Its prototype is as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
double atof (const char *str);
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt; argument points to a [[string (computer science)|string]], represented by an array of characters, containing the ''character'' representation of a floating point value. If the string is not a valid textual representation of a &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;atof&lt;/code&gt; will silently fail, returning zero (0.0) in that case. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf ISO/IEC 9899:1999 specification], p. 307, § 7.20.1.1 &lt;/ref&gt;

Note that while &lt;code&gt;[[atoi]]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[[Atol (programming)|atol]]&lt;/code&gt; return variable types corresponding with their name (&quot;&lt;code&gt;ato'''i'''&lt;/code&gt;&quot; returns an integer and &quot;&lt;code&gt;ato'''l'''&lt;/code&gt;&quot; returns a long integer), atof however, does not return a  &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;, it returns a &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;.

A related function is [[sscanf]]. This function extracts values from strings and its return argument is the number of valid values it managed to extract (so, unlike &lt;code&gt;atof&lt;/code&gt;,  &lt;code&gt;sscanf&lt;/code&gt; can be used to test if a string starts with a valid number).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''setjmp.h''' is a [[header file|header]] defined in the [[C standard library]] to provide &quot;non-local jumps&quot;: [[control flow]] that deviates from the usual [[subroutine]] call and return sequence. The complementary functions '''&lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt;''' and '''&lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt;''' provide this functionality. 

A typical use of &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt; is implementation of an [[exception mechanism]] that utilizes the ability of &lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt; to reestablish program or thread state, even across multiple levels of function calls. A less common use of &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt; is to create syntax similar to [[Coroutine#Implementations_for_C|coroutine]]s.

==Member functions==

{| class = wikitable
|-
|&lt;code&gt;int setjmp(jmp_buf&amp;nbsp;env)&lt;/code&gt; || Sets up the local &lt;code&gt;jmp_buf&lt;/code&gt; buffer and initializes it for the jump. This routine&lt;ref name=&quot;macro&quot;&gt;ISO C states that &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt; must be implemented as a macro, but POSIX explicitly states that it is undefined whether &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt; is a macro or a function.&lt;/ref&gt; saves the program's calling environment in the environment buffer specified by the &lt;code&gt;env&lt;/code&gt; argument for later use by &lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt;. If the return is from a direct invocation, &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt; returns 0. If the return is from a call to &lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt; returns a nonzero value.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;void longjmp(jmp_buf&amp;nbsp;env, int&amp;nbsp;value)&lt;/code&gt; || Restores the context of the environment buffer &lt;code&gt;env&lt;/code&gt; that was saved by invocation of the &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt; routine&lt;ref name=&quot;macro&quot;/&gt; in the same invocation of the program. Invoking longjmp from a nested signal handler is [[undefined behavior|undefined]]. The value specified by &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; is passed from &lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt;. After &lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt; is completed, program execution continues as if the corresponding invocation of &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt; had just returned. If the &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; passed to &lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt; is 0, &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt; will behave as if it had returned 1; otherwise, it will behave as if it had returned &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt;.
|-
|}

&lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt; saves the current environment (i.e., the program state) at some point of program execution, into a platform-specific data structure (&lt;code&gt;jmp_buf&lt;/code&gt;) which can be used, at some later point of program execution, by &lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt; to restore the program state to that which was saved by &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;jmp_buf&lt;/code&gt;. This process can be imagined to be a &quot;jump&quot; back to the point of program execution where &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt; saved the environment. The (apparent) [[return value]] from &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt; indicates whether control reached that point normally or from a call to &lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt;. This leads to a common [[Programming idiom|idiom]]: &lt;code&gt;if( setjmp(x) ){/* handle longjmp(x) */}&lt;/code&gt;.

[[POSIX]].1 does not specify whether &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt; save or restore the current set of blocked [[signal (computing)|signals]] &amp;mdash; if a program employs signal handling it should use POSIX's &lt;code&gt;sigsetjmp&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;siglongjmp&lt;/code&gt;.

==Member types==

|-
|&lt;code&gt;jmp_buf&lt;/code&gt; || An array type, such as &lt;code&gt;struct __jmp_buf_tag[1]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This is the type used by the [[GNU C Library]], version 2.7&lt;/ref&gt;, suitable for holding the information needed to restore a calling environment.
|}

The C99 Rationale describes &lt;code&gt;jmp_buf&lt;/code&gt; as being an array type for [[backwards compatibility]]; existing code refers to &lt;code&gt;jmp_buf&lt;/code&gt; storage locations by name (without the &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; address-of operator), which is only possible for array types.&lt;ref name=&quot;rationale&quot;&gt;[http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/C99RationaleV5.10.pdf C99 Rationale, version 5.10, April 2003], section 7.13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caveats and limitations==
When a &quot;non-local goto&quot; is executed via &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt;, normal &quot;stack unwinding&quot; does not occur and therefore, any required cleanup actions such as closing [[file descriptor]]s, flushing [[Buffer (computer science)|buffer]]s, freeing [[Dynamic memory allocation|heap-allocated memory]], etc., do not occur.

If the function in which &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt; was called returns, it is no longer possible to safely use &lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt; with the corresponding &lt;code&gt;jmp_buf&lt;/code&gt; object. This is because the [[stack frame]] is invalidated when the function returns. Calling &lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt; restores the [[stack pointer]], which—because the function returned—would point to a non-existent and potentially overwritten/corrupted stack frame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mbeck/classes/cs560/360/notes/Setjmp/lecture.html CS360 Lecture Notes — Setjmp and Longjmp]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uwm.edu/cgi-bin/IMT/wwwman?topic=setjmp(3)&amp;msection= setjmp(3)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[C99]] does not require that &lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt; preserve the current stack frame. This means that jumping into a function which was exited via a call to &lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt; is undefined.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO/IEC 9899:1999&quot;&gt;[http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf ISO/IEC 9899:1999], 2005, 7.13.2.1:2 and footnote 211&lt;/ref&gt; However, most implementations of &lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt; leave the stack frame intact, allowing &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt; to be used to jump back-and-forth between two or more functions—a feature exploited for [[#Cooperative multitasking|multitasking]].

Compared to mechanisms in higher-level programming languages such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], and even pre-C languages such as [[Algol 60]], the technique of using &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt; to implement an exception mechanism is uninspiring.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} These languages provide more powerful [[exception handling]] techniques, while languages such as [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], [[Smalltalk]], and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] provide even more general [[continuation]]-handling constructs.

== Example usage ==
=== Simple example ===
This example shows the basic idea of setjmp. Main calls first, which in turn calls second. The &quot;second&quot; function jumps back into main, skipping &quot;first&quot;'s print statement. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;setjmp.h&gt;

static jmp_buf buf;

void second(void) {
    printf(&quot;second\n&quot;);         // prints
    longjmp(buf,1);             // jumps back to where setjmp was called - making setjmp now return 1
}

void first(void) {
    second();
    printf(&quot;first\n&quot;);          // does not print
}

int main() {   
    if ( ! setjmp(buf) ) {
        first();                // when executed, setjmp returns 0
    } else {                    // when longjmp jumps back, setjmp returns 1
        printf(&quot;main\n&quot;);       // prints
    }

    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
When executed, the above program will output: 
 second
 main
Notice that although the &lt;code&gt;first()&lt;/code&gt; subroutine gets called, &quot;&lt;code&gt;first&lt;/code&gt;&quot; never is printed. &quot;&lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;&quot; gets printed as the conditional statement &lt;code&gt;if ( ! setjmp(buf) )&lt;/code&gt; is executed a second time.

=== Exception handling ===
In this example, &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt; is used to bracket exception handling, like [[try-catch block|&lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;]] in some other languages. The call to &lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt; is analogous to a &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt; statement, allowing an exception to return an error status directly to the &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt;. The following code adheres to the [[C (programming language)#C99|1999 ISO C standard]] and [[Single UNIX Specification]] by invoking &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt; in a limited range of contexts:&lt;ref name=&quot;SUS&quot;&gt;{{man|sh|setjmp|SUS|set jump point for a non-local goto}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*As the condition to an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; or iteration statement
*As above in conjunction with a single &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; or comparison with an integer constant
*As a statement (with the return value unused)
Following these rules can make it easier for the implementation to create the environment buffer, which can be a sensitive operation.&lt;ref name=&quot;rationale&quot; /&gt; More general use of &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt; can cause undefined behaviour, such as corruption of local variables; conforming compilers and environments are not required to protect or even warn against such usage. However, slightly more sophisticated idioms such as &lt;code&gt;switch ((exception_type = setjmp(env))) { }&lt;/code&gt; are common in literature and practice, and remain relatively portable. A simple conforming methodology is presented below, where an additional variable is maintained along with the state buffer. This variable could be elaborated into a structure incorporating the buffer itself.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;setjmp.h&gt;
 
void first(void);
void second(void);
 
/* This program's output is:
 
calling first
calling second
entering second
second failed with type 3 exception; remapping to type 1.
first failed, exception type 1
 
*/
 
/* Use a file scoped static variable for the exception stack so we can access
 * it anywhere within this translation unit. */
static jmp_buf exception_env;
static int exception_type;
 
int main() {
    void *volatile mem_buffer;
 
    mem_buffer = NULL;
    if (setjmp(exception_env)) {
        /* if we get here there was an exception */
        printf(&quot;first failed, exception type %d\n&quot;, exception_type);
    } else {

        case 3:
            /* if we get here there was an exception. */
            printf(&quot;second failed with type 3 exception; remapping to type 1.\n&quot;);
            exception_type = 1;

        default: /* fall through */
            memcpy(exception_env, my_env, sizeof(jmp_buf)); /* restore exception stack */
            longjmp(exception_env, exception_type); /* continue handling the exception */

        case 0:
            /* normal, desired operation */
            second();
            printf(&quot;second succeeded\n&quot;);  /* not reached */
    }
    memcpy(exception_env, my_env, sizeof(jmp_buf)); /* restore exception stack */
}
 
void second(void) {
    printf(&quot;entering second\n&quot; ); /* reached */
    exception_type = 3;
    longjmp(exception_env, exception_type); /* declare that the program has failed */
    printf(&quot;leaving second\n&quot;); /* not reached */
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Cooperative multitasking===
[[C99]] provides that &lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt; is guaranteed to work only when the destination is a calling function, i.e., that the destination scope is guaranteed to be intact. Jumping to a function that has already terminated by &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt; is undefined.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO/IEC 9899:1999&quot;/&gt; However, most implementations of &lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt; do not specifically destroy local variables when performing the jump. Since the context survives until its local variables are erased, it could actually be restored by &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt;. In many environments (such as Really Simple Threads and TinyTimbers), idioms such as &lt;code&gt;if(!setjmp(child_env)) longjmp(caller_env);&lt;/code&gt; can allow a called function to effectively pause-and-resume at a &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt;.

This is exploited by thread libraries to provide [[cooperative multitasking]] facilities without using &lt;code&gt;[[setcontext]]&lt;/code&gt; or other [[fiber (computer science)|fiber]] facilities.  Whereas &lt;code&gt;setcontext&lt;/code&gt; is a library service which can create an execution context in heap-allocated memory and can support other services such as [[buffer overflow protection]]{{Fact|date=April 2008}}, abuse of &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt; is implemented by the programmer, who may reserve memory on the stack and fail to notify the library or operating system of the new operating context. On the other hand, a library's implementation of &lt;code&gt;setcontext&lt;/code&gt; may internally use &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt; in a fashion similar to this example to save and restore a context, after it has been initialised somehow.

Considering that &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt; to a child function will generally work unless sabotaged, and &lt;code&gt;setcontext&lt;/code&gt;, as part of [[POSIX]], is not required to be provided by C implementations, this mechanism may be portable where the &lt;code&gt;setcontext&lt;/code&gt; alternative fails.

Since no exception will be generated upon overflow of one of the multiple stacks in such a mechanism, it is essential to overestimate the space required for each context, including the one containing &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; and including space for any signal handlers that might interrupt regular execution. Exceeding the allocated space will corrupt the other contexts, usually with the outermost functions first. Unfortunately, systems requiring this kind of programming strategy are often also small ones with limited resources.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;setjmp.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

jmp_buf mainTask, childTask;

void call_with_cushion(void);
void child(void);

int main(void) {
    if (!setjmp(mainTask)) {
        call_with_cushion(); /* child never returns */ /* yield */
    } /* execution resumes after this &quot;}&quot; after first time that child yields */
    for (;;) {
        printf(&quot;Parent\n&quot;);
        if (!setjmp(mainTask)) {
            longjmp(childTask, 1); /* yield - note that this is undefined under C99 */
        }
    }
}


void call_with_cushion (void) {
    char space[1000]; /* Reserve enough space for main to run */
    space[999] = 1; /* Do not optimize array out of existence */
    child();
}

void child (void) {
    for (;;) {
        printf(&quot;Child loop begin\n&quot;);
        if (!setjmp(childTask)) longjmp(mainTask, 1); /* yield - invalidates childTask in C99 */

        printf(&quot;Child loop end\n&quot;);
        if (!setjmp(childTask)) longjmp(mainTask, 1); /* yield - invalidates childTask in C99 */
    }
    /* Don't return. Instead we should set a flag to indicate that main()
       should stop yielding to us and then longjmp(mainTask, 1) */
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''signal.h''' is a [[header file]] defined in the [[C Standard Library]] to specify how a program handles [[Signal_(computing)|signals]] while it executes. A signal can report some exceptional behavior within the program (''such as [[division by zero]]''), or a signal can report some asynchronous event outside the program (''such as someone striking an [[SIGINT (POSIX)|interactive attention key]] on a keyboard'').

A signal can be generated by calling &lt;code&gt;raise&lt;/code&gt; (to send a signal to the current process) or &lt;code&gt;kill&lt;/code&gt; (to send a signal to any process). Each implementation defines what signals it generates (if any) and under what circumstances it generates them. An implementation can define signals other than the ones listed here. The standard header &lt;signal.h&gt; can define additional macros with names beginning with SIG to specify the values of additional signals. All such values are integer constant expressions &gt;= 0.

A signal handler can be specified for all but two signals ([[SIGKILL]] and [[SIGSTOP]] cannot be caught, blocked or ignored). A signal handler is a [[Function (computer science)|function]] that the target environment calls when the corresponding signal occurs. The target environment suspends execution of the program until the signal handler returns or calls longjmp. For maximum portability, an asynchronous signal handler should only:
*make calls (that succeed) to the function signal
*assign values to objects of type [[volatile variable|volatile]] &lt;code&gt;sig_atomic_t&lt;/code&gt;
*return control to its caller

If the signal reports an error within the program (and the signal is not asynchronous), the signal handler can terminate by calling &lt;code&gt;abort&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;exit&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;[[setjmp.h|longjmp]]&lt;/code&gt;.

== Member functions ==
*&lt;code&gt;int raise(int sig)&lt;/code&gt;. This raises a signal artificially. It causes signal sig to be generated. The sig argument is compatible with the SIG macros.If the call is successful, zero is returned. Otherwise a nonzero value is returned. 
Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;signal.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

static void catch_function(int signal) {
    puts(&quot;Interactive attention signal caught.&quot;);
}

int main(void) {
    if (signal(SIGINT, catch_function) == SIG_ERR) {
        fputs(&quot;An error occurred while setting a signal handler.\n&quot;, stderr);
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
    puts(&quot;Raising the interactive attention signal.&quot;);
    if (raise(SIGINT) != 0) {
        fputs(&quot;Error raising the signal.\n&quot;, stderr);
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
    puts(&quot;Exiting.&quot;);
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

*&lt;code&gt;[[psignal]](int sig, const char *s)&lt;/code&gt;, outputs to [[stderr]] a string representation of a signal number.  It is in [[4.3BSD]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] and [[Linux]], but is not specified by [[POSIX]] or [[Single UNIX Specification|SUS]].

On the same systems, [[string.h]] contains the non-standard &lt;code&gt;[[strsignal]](int sig)&lt;/code&gt; which operates analogously to [[strerror]].

*&lt;code&gt;void (* signal(int sig, void (*func)(int)) )(int)&lt;/code&gt;, sets the action taken when the program receives the signal &lt;code&gt;sig&lt;/code&gt;. If the value of func is SIG_DFL, default handling for that signal will occur. If the value of func is SIG_IGN, the signal will be ignored. Otherwise func points to a ''signal handler'' function to be called when the signal occurs.

The function func may terminate by executing a return statement or by calling the abort, exit or longjmp functions. If func executes a return statement, and the value of sig was SIGFPE or any other implementation-defined value corresponding to a computational exception, the behavior is undefined. Otherwise, the program will resume execution at the point it was interrupted. If the function returns and the return request can be honored, the signal function returns the value of func for the most recent call to signal for the specified signal sig. Otherwise a value of SIG_ERR is returned and a positive value is stored in errno.

If the signal occurs other than as the result of calling the abort or raise function, the behavior is undefined if the signal handler calls any function in the standard library other than the signal function itself (with a first argument of the signal number corresponding to the signal that cause the invocation of the handler) or refers to any object with status storage duration other than by assigning to a static storage duration variable of type volatile sig_atomic_t. Furthermore, if such a call to the signal function results in a SIG_ERR return, the value of errno is indeterminate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xgc.com/manuals/xgclib/c1632.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''&lt;code&gt;stdarg.h&lt;/code&gt;''' is a header that allows functions to accept an indefinite number of arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/stdarg.h.html | title=IEEE Std 1003.1 &lt;code&gt;stdarg.h&lt;/code&gt; | accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides facilities for stepping through a list of function arguments of unknown number and type.

The contents of &lt;code&gt;stdarg.h&lt;/code&gt; are typically used in variadic functions, though they may be used in other functions (for example, &lt;code&gt;vprintf&lt;/code&gt;) called by variadic functions.

==Declaring variadic functions==

Variadic functions are functions which may take a variable number of arguments and are declared with an ellipsis (&lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt;) in place of the last parameter. An example of such a function is &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;. A typical declaration is 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int check(int a, double b, ...);
&lt;/source&gt;

Variadic functions must have at least one named parameter, so, for instance,

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char *wrong(...);
&lt;/source&gt;

is not allowed in C. (In C++, such a declaration is permitted, but not very useful.) In C, a comma must precede the ellipsis; in C++, it is optional.

==Defining variadic functions==
The same syntax is used in a definition:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
long func(char, double, int, ...);

long func(char a, double b, int c, ...)
{
    /* ... */
}
&lt;/source&gt;

An ellipsis may also appear in old-style function definitions:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
long func();

long func(a, b, c, ...)
    char a;
    double b;
{
    /* ... */
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==&lt;code&gt;stdarg.h&lt;/code&gt; types==

|-
|&lt;code&gt;va_copy&lt;/code&gt; || Copy contents of one &lt;code&gt;va_list&lt;/code&gt; to another || [[C99]]
|}

==Accessing the arguments==

To access the unnamed arguments, one must declare a variable of type &lt;code&gt;va_list&lt;/code&gt; in the variadic function. The macro &lt;code&gt;va_start&lt;/code&gt; is then called with two arguments: the first is the variable declared of the type &lt;code&gt;va_list&lt;/code&gt;, the second is the name of the last named parameter of the function. After this, each invocation of the &lt;code&gt;va_arg&lt;/code&gt; macro yields the next argument. The first argument to &lt;code&gt;va_arg&lt;/code&gt; is the &lt;code&gt;va_list&lt;/code&gt; and the second is the type of the next argument passed to the function. Finally, the &lt;code&gt;va_end&lt;/code&gt; macro must be called on the &lt;code&gt;va_list&lt;code&gt; before the function returns. (It is not required to read in all the arguments.)

[[C99]] provides an additional macro, &lt;code&gt;va_copy&lt;/code&gt;, which can duplicate the state of a &lt;code&gt;va_list&lt;/code&gt;. The macro invocation &lt;code&gt;va_copy(va2, va1)&lt;/code&gt; copies &lt;code&gt;va1&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;va2&lt;/code&gt;.

There is no mechanism defined for determining the number or types of the unnamed arguments passed to the function. The function is simply required to know or determine this somehow, the means of which vary.  Common conventions include:
* Use of a &lt;code&gt;[[printf]]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;[[scanf]]&lt;/code&gt;-like format string with embedded specifiers that indicate argument types.
* A [[sentinel value]] at the end of the variadic arguments.
* A count argument indicating the number of variadic arguments.

==Type safety==

Some C implementations provide C extensions that allow the compiler to check for the proper use of format strings and sentinels.  Barring these extensions, the compiler usually cannot check whether the unnamed arguments passed are of the type the function expects, or convert them to the required type. Therefore, care should be taken to ensure correctness in this regard, since [[undefined behavior]] results if the types do not match. For example, if passing a null pointer, one should not write simply &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; (which may be defined as &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;) but cast to the appropriate pointer type. Another consideration is the default argument [[Type_conversion#Type_promotion_in_C-like_languages|promotions]] applied to the unnamed arguments. A &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; will automatically be promoted to a &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;. Likewise, arguments of types narrower than an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; will be promoted to &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;unsigned int&lt;/code&gt;. The function receiving the unnamed arguments must expect the promoted type.

[[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] has an extension that checks the passed arguments:

{{quote|
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;format(archetype, string-index, first-to-check)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The format attribute specifies that a function takes &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;scanf&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;strftime&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;strfmon&lt;/code&gt; style arguments which should be type-checked against a format string. For example, the declaration:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
extern int
my_printf (void *my_object, const char *my_format, ...)
      __attribute__ ((format (printf, 2, 3)));
&lt;/source&gt;

causes the compiler to check the arguments in calls to &lt;code&gt;my_printf&lt;/code&gt; for consistency with the &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; style format string argument &lt;code&gt;my_format&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;|{{cite web | title = 5.27 Extensions to the C Language Family - Declaring Attributes of Functions | url=http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.3.2/gcc/Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes | accessdate = 2009-01-03 }}}}

==Example==

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;

/* print all non-negative args one at a time;
   all args are assumed to be of int type */
void printargs(int arg1, ...)
{
  va_list ap;
  int i;

  va_start(ap, arg1); 
  for (i = arg1; i &gt;= 0; i = va_arg(ap, int))
    printf(&quot;%d &quot;, i);
  va_end(ap);
  putchar('\n');
}

int main(void)
{
   printargs(5, 2, 14, 84, 97, 15, 24, 48, -1);
   printargs(84, 51, -1);
   printargs(-1);
   printargs(1, -1);
   return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This program yields the output:

&lt;pre&gt;
5 2 14 84 97 15 24 48
84 51

1
&lt;/pre&gt;

To call other var args functions from within your function (such as sprintf) you need to use the var arg version of the function (vsprintf in this example):
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
void MyPrintf(const char* format, ...)
{
  va_list args;
  char buffer[BUFSIZ];

  va_start(args,format);
  vsprintf (buffer, format, args );
  FlushFunnyStream(buffer);  
  va_end(args);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==&lt;code&gt;varargs.h&lt;/code&gt;==
[[POSIX]] defines the legacy header &lt;code&gt;varargs.h&lt;/code&gt;, which dates from before the standardization of C and provides functionality similar to &lt;code&gt;stdarg.h&lt;/code&gt;. This header is not part of ISO C. The file, as defined in the second version of the [[Single UNIX Specification]], simply contains all of the functionality of C89 &lt;code&gt;stdarg.h&lt;/code&gt;, with the exceptions that: it cannot be used in standard C new-style definitions; you may choose not to have a given argument (standard C requires at least one argument); and the way it works is different—in standard C, one would write:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;

int summate(int n, ...)
{
    va_list ap;
    int i = 0;

    va_start(ap, n);
    for (; n; n--)
        i += va_arg(ap, int);
    va_end(ap);
    return i;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

or with old-style function definitions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;

int summate(n, ...)
    int n;
{
    /* ... */
}
&lt;/source&gt;

and call with

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
summate(0);
summate(1, 2);
summate(4, 9, 2, 3, 2);
&lt;/source&gt;

With &lt;code&gt;varargs.h&lt;/code&gt;, the function would be:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;varargs.h&gt;

summate(n, va_alist)
    va_dcl /* no semicolon here! */
{
    va_list ap;
    int i = 0;

    va_start(ap);
    for (; n; n--)
        i += va_arg(ap, int);
    va_end(ap);
    return i;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

and is called the same way.

&lt;code&gt;varargs.h&lt;/code&gt; requires old-style function definitions because of the way the implementation works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/varargs.h.html | title=Single UNIX Specification &lt;code&gt;varargs.h&lt;/code&gt; | accessdate=2007-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''fclose''' is a [[C programming language|C]] [[Subroutine|function]] belonging to the [[ANSI C]] standard library, and included in the file [[stdio.h]]. Its purpose is close a stream and all the structure associated with it. Usually the stream is an open file. &lt;code&gt;fclose&lt;/code&gt; has the following prototype:

:&lt;code&gt;int fclose(FILE *file_pointer)&lt;/code&gt;

It takes one argument: a pointer to the ''FILE'' structure of the stream to close, eg:
&lt;code&gt;:fclose(''my_file_pointer'')&lt;/code&gt;
This line call the function fclose to close ''FILE'' stream structure pointed by ''my_file_pointer''.

The return value is an integer with the following meaning:
* ''0'' (zero): the stream was closed successfully;
* ''EOF'': an error occurred;

One can check for an error by reading [[errno]]. fclose has undefined behavior if it attempts to close a file pointer that isn't currently assigned to a file - in many cases, this results in a program crash.

==Example usage==
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

 int main(void) 
 {
   FILE *file_pointer;
   int i;
 
   file_pointer = fopen(&quot;myfile.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;);
   fscanf(file_pointer, &quot;%d&quot;, &amp;i);
   printf(&quot;The integer is %d\n&quot;, i);
   fclose(file_pointer);
   
   return 0;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

The above program opens a file called ''myfile.txt'' and scans for an integer in it.

The '''fgetc''' function in the [[C standard library]] &lt;code&gt;[[stdio.h]]&lt;/code&gt; is used to read a character from a file stream.

:&lt;code&gt;int fgetc(FILE *stream)&lt;/code&gt;

Where &lt;code&gt;FILE *stream&lt;/code&gt; is an initialised [[Pointer#C.2FC.2B.2B|pointer]] to a file. 

If successful, fgetc returns a character from the file at it's current position. If unsuccessful, fgetc returns an error code. For text files (as opposed to binary files), the characters with values 25 and 26 (the [[Substitute character]] and the [[escape character]]) may render the input stream inoperable afterward, instead returning a single maximal value.

Error codes:
:-1: Bad argument: not integer
:-2: Bad argument: out of range
:-3: File was not open

'''fgets''' is a [[function (computer science)|function]] in the [[C programming language]] that reads a limited number of [[character (computing)|character]]s from a given file stream source into an array of characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | url=http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf 
 | title=ISO/IEC 9899:1999 specification
 | at=p. 296, § 7.19.7.2
}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;code&gt;fgets&lt;/code&gt; stands for ''file get string''. It is included in the [[C standard library]] [[header file]] &lt;code&gt;[[stdio.h]]&lt;/code&gt;.  The prototype of the function is as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char* fgets(char *string, int length, FILE * stream);
&lt;/source&gt;

The function terminates reading either after a [[new-line]] character is found or [[end-of-file]] is reached, or after (''length'' - 1) characters have been read. If a new-line was reached it is included in the string as the last character before the null character. The length argument includes space needed for the [[null character]] which will be appended to the end of the string. As a result, to read '''''N''''' characters, the length specification must be specified as '''''N+1'''''. The string read is returned if at least one character was read and no error occurred, otherwise a NULL-pointer is returned.

The stream argument specifies the stream from which the string be read. &lt;code&gt;stdin&lt;/code&gt; is commonly used here, for reading from the standard input. Otherwise, a &lt;code&gt;FILE *&lt;/code&gt; value returned by the &lt;code&gt;[[fopen]]()&lt;code&gt; function is used.

==Sample usage==
The following code reads characters from the [[computer console|console]] input and prints them out 20 in a line with the puts function until an [[End-of-file|EOF]] occurs.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#define MAX_LEN 20

int main(void)
{
  char str_buf[MAX_LEN + 1]; // One extra byte needed
                             // for the null character

  while(fgets(str_buf, sizeof str_buf, stdin) != NULL)
	puts(str_buf);

  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Use in POSIX utilities==

For compliance with [[POSIX]] utility line lengths, the definition &lt;code&gt;LINE_MAX&lt;/code&gt; (generally found in [[limits.h]]) is often used to size the character buffer.

==Limitations==

The fixed buffer size imposed by &lt;code&gt;fgets()&lt;/code&gt; is cumbersome in applications which need to handle arbitrarily long lines of text.  

POSIX.1-2008-conforming systems provide a function called &lt;code&gt;getline()&lt;/code&gt; (originally a GNU extension&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Line-Input.html#index-getline-993&lt;/ref&gt;), which will read an entire line, reallocating the buffer if it is not long enough.&lt;ref&gt;http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/getline.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced applications can avoid buffer limitations by using [[mmap]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Printf.svg|350px|thumb|An example of the printf function.]]

'''Printf functions''' (which stands for &quot;'''print f'''ormatted&quot;) are a class of [[function (computer science)|functions]] typically associated with some types of [[programming languages]].  They accept a [[string (computer science)|string]] [[parameter (computer science)|parameter]] called the '''format string''', which specifies a method for rendering an arbitrary number of varied data type parameter(s) into a string.  This string is then by default printed on the [[standard output]] stream, but variants exist that perform other tasks with the result.  Characters in the format string are usually copied literally into the function's output, with the other parameters being rendered into the resulting text at points marked by '''format specifiers''', which are typically introduced by a [[percent sign|'''%''' character]].

==Timeline==
Many [[programming languages]] implement a '''&lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;''' [[subroutine|function]], to output a formatted [[string literal|string]]. It originated from the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], where it has a [[Function prototype|prototype]] similar to the following:
  &lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;int printf(const char *format, ...)&lt;/source&gt;
The [[Variable (programming)|string constant]] &lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt; provides a description of the output, with [[Free variables and bound variables|placeholder]]s marked by &quot;%&quot; [[escape character]]s, to specify both the relative location and the type of output that the function should produce. The return value yields the number of printed characters.

=== Fortran, COBOL ===
Fortran's [[Variadic function|variadic]] &lt;code&gt; PRINT &lt;/code&gt; statement referenced a non-executable &lt;code&gt; FORMAT &lt;/code&gt; statement.
&lt;code&gt;
      PRINT 601, 123456, 1000.0, 3.1415, 250
  601 FORMAT (8H RED NUM I7,4H EXP,E8.1, ' REAL' F5.2,'; VALUE=',I4)
&lt;/code&gt;
will print the following ( after advancing to a new line, because of the leading blank character if directed to a printing device)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=ASA Print Control Characters| url=http://www.felgall.com/asa.htm | accessdate=February 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;:
&lt;code&gt;
 RED NUM 123456 EXP 1.0E 03 REAL 3.14; VALUE= 250
&lt;/code&gt;

COBOL provided formatting via hierarchical data structure specification:
&lt;code&gt; 
 01 out-rec.
   02 out-name   picture x(20).
   02 out-amount picture  $9,999.99.&lt;/code&gt;
...
&lt;code&gt;
    move me to out-name.
    move amount to out-amout.
    write out-rec.&lt;/code&gt;

=== 1960s: BCPL, ALGOL 68, Multics PL/I ===
C's [[Variadic function|variadic]] &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; has its origins in [[BCPL]]'s &lt;code&gt;writef&lt;/code&gt; function.

[[ALGOL 68]] Draft and Final report had the functions &lt;code&gt;inf&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;outf&lt;/code&gt;, subsequently these were revised out of the original language and replaced with the now more familiar &lt;code&gt;readf/getf&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;printf/putf&lt;/code&gt;.
 printf(($&quot;Color &quot;g&quot;, number1 &quot;6d,&quot;, number2 &quot;4zd,&quot;, hex &quot;16r2d,&quot;, float &quot;-d.2d,&quot;, unsigned value&quot;-3d&quot;.&quot;l$,
             &quot;red&quot;, 123456, 89, BIN 255, 3.14, 250));

[[Multics]] has a standard function called &lt;code&gt;ioa_&lt;/code&gt; with a wide variety of control codes.  It was based on a machine-language facility from Multics's BOS (Bootstrap Operating System).
 &lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 call ioa_ (&quot;Hello, ^a&quot;, &quot;World!&quot;);
 &lt;/source&gt;

=== 1970s: C, Lisp ===
 &lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 printf(&quot;Color %s, number1 %d, number2 %05d, hex %x, float %5.2f, unsigned value %u.\n&quot;,
        &quot;red&quot;, 123456, 89, 255, 3.14159, 250);
 &lt;/source&gt;
will print the following line (including new-line character, \n):
 Color red, number1 123456, number2 00089, hex ff, float  3.14, unsigned value 250.

The &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; function returns the number of characters printed, or a negative value if an output error occurs.

[[Common Lisp]] has the &lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt; function.
 &lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (format t &quot;Hello, ~a&quot; &quot;World!&quot;)
 &lt;/source&gt;

prints &lt;code&gt;&quot;Hello, World!&quot;&lt;/code&gt; on the standard output stream.  If the first argument is &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;, format returns the string to its caller.  The first argument can also be any output stream.  &lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt; was introduced into [[ZetaLisp]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1978, based on the [[Multics]] &lt;code&gt;ioa_&lt;/code&gt;, and was later adopted into the [[Common Lisp]] standard.

===1980s: Perl, Shell===
[[Perl]] also has a &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; function. [[Common Lisp]] has a [[format (Common Lisp)|format]] function which acts according to the same principles as &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;, but uses different characters for output conversion. The [[GLib]] library contains &lt;code&gt;g_print&lt;/code&gt;, an implementation of &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;.

Some [[Unix]] systems have a &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; program for use in [[shell script]]s. This can be used instead of [[echo (command)|echo]] in situations where the latter is not portable. For example:
 &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo -n -e &quot;$FOO\t$BAR&quot;&lt;/source&gt;
may be rewritten portably as:
 &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;printf &quot;%s\t%s&quot; &quot;$FOO&quot; &quot;$BAR&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

=== 1990s: PHP, Python ===
1991: [[Python (programming language)|Python]]'s &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; operator harkens to &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;'s syntax when interpolating the contents of a tuple.  This operator can, for example, be used with the &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;print(&quot;%s\t%s&quot; % (foo,bar))&lt;/source&gt;

Version 2.6 of Python included the &lt;code&gt;str.format()&lt;/code&gt; which is preferred to the obsolete &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; which may go away in future versions of Python:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;print(&quot;If you multiply five and six you get {0}.&quot;.format(5*6))&lt;/source&gt;

1995: [[PHP]] also has the &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; function, with the same specifications and usage as that in C/C++. [[MATLAB]] does not have &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;, but does have its two extensions &lt;code&gt;sprintf&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fprintf&lt;/code&gt; which use the same formatting strings. &lt;code&gt;sprintf&lt;/code&gt; returns a formatted string instead of producing a visual output.

=== 2000s: Java ===
2004: [[Java (programming language)|Java]] supported &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; from version 1.5 onwards as a member of the &lt;code&gt;PrintStream&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web

At the same time &lt;code&gt;sprintf&lt;/code&gt;-like functionality was added to the &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; class by adding the &lt;code&gt;format(String, Object... args)&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web

&lt;source lang=&quot;java5&quot;&gt;
// Write &quot;Hello, World!&quot; to standard output (like printf)
System.out.printf(&quot;%s, %s&quot;, &quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World!&quot;); 
// create a String object with the value &quot;Hello, World!&quot; (like sprintf)
String myString = String.format(&quot;%s, %s&quot;, &quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World!&quot;); 
&lt;/source&gt;
Unlike most other implementations, Java's implementation of &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; throws an [[exception handling|exception]] on encountering a malformed format string.

==Related functions==
The [[ANSI C]] standard specifies a number of variations of printf for situations where the output stream is not the default, where the parameter list is in a different form, where the output is targeting memory rather than a [[file descriptor]], and so on.  The printf function itself is often merely a wrapper, with defaults, around one of these:

===fprintf===
 &lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;int fprintf(FILE *stream, const char *format, ...)&lt;/source&gt;

'''&lt;code&gt;fprintf&lt;/code&gt;''' enables printf output to be written to any file. Programmers frequently use it to print errors, by writing to the [[Standard streams#Standard error|standard error]] device, but it can operate with any file opened with the &lt;code&gt;[[fopen]]&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;[[fdopen]]&lt;/code&gt;) function.

===sprintf===
 &lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;int sprintf (char *str, const char *format, ...)&lt;/source&gt;

'''&lt;code&gt;sprintf&lt;/code&gt;''' prints to a string (&lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; array) instead of [[Standard streams#Standard output|standard output]]. Users of &lt;code&gt;sprintf&lt;/code&gt; must ensure, via calculation or via a [[guard page]], that the resulting string will not be larger than the memory allocated for ''str''. Failure to ensure this can allow a [[buffer overflow]] to occur.

In higher-level languages such as [[PHP]] the &lt;code&gt;sprintf&lt;/code&gt; function does not have the &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt; argument. Instead, it returns the formatted output string. The prototype in PHP is like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;string sprintf (const string format, ...)&lt;/source&gt;

===Buffer safety and sprintf===
In ISO C99, '''&lt;code&gt;snprintf&lt;/code&gt;''' was introduced as an alternative to '''&lt;code&gt;sprintf&lt;/code&gt;''' that can help avoid the risk of a buffer overflow:

 &lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;int snprintf(char *str, size_t size, const char * restrict format, ...)&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;snprintf&lt;/code&gt; is guaranteed not to write more than ''size'' bytes into ''str'', so use of it can help avoid the risk of a buffer overflow, as in the following code fragment:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#define BUFFER_SIZE 50
char buf[BUFFER_SIZE];
int n;
n = snprintf(buf, BUFFER_SIZE, &quot;Your name is %s.\n&quot;, username);
if (n &lt; 0 || n &gt;= BUFFER_SIZE)
   /* Handle error */
&lt;/source&gt;
If ''username'' in the above example causes result to exceed 49 bytes in length, the function will limit the string that gets saved in ''buf'' by cutting off final bytes ([[Data_truncation|truncating]]). The null terminator will always be written to the 50th location so the result is always null terminated. Additionally, the return code of &lt;code&gt;snprintf&lt;/code&gt; indicates how many bytes (not counting the null) the function ''would'' have written to the string had enough space existed. Systems can use this information to allocate a new (larger) buffer if they require the whole string.

A number of &lt;code&gt;snprintf&lt;/code&gt; implementations deviated from the above description, in particular many Windows libraries, [[glibc]] before version 2.0.6, and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]]. The most common mistake was returning -1 on truncation rather than the length needed. More troublesome were implementations that did not write the null terminator on truncation, or returned size-1 (making it impossible to detect truncation). These deviations make writing portable safe code using &lt;code&gt;snprintf&lt;/code&gt; harder than it should be.

Another safe &lt;code&gt;sprintf&lt;/code&gt; alternative is '''&lt;code&gt;asprintf&lt;/code&gt;''' which is a GNU extension:

 &lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;int asprintf(char **ret, const char *format, ...)&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;asprintf&lt;/code&gt; automatically allocates enough memory to hold the final string. It sets &lt;code&gt;*ret&lt;/code&gt; to a pointer to the resulting string, or to an undefined value if an error occurred ([[glibc]] is notable in being the only implementation that doesn't always set &lt;code&gt;*ret&lt;/code&gt; to [[Null pointer|NULL]] on error). The programmer using &lt;code&gt;asprintf&lt;/code&gt; has the responsibility of freeing the allocated memory after use. Though not part of any standard, &lt;code&gt;asprintf&lt;/code&gt; comes in the C libraries of several operating systems (including [[OpenBSD]], [[FreeBSD]], and [[NetBSD]]) and on other platforms in the [[libiberty]] library.

[[GLib]] provides yet another safe alternative: &lt;code&gt;g_strdup_printf&lt;/code&gt;, which allocates enough memory, but, unlike &lt;code&gt;asprintf&lt;/code&gt;, returns the resulting string as its return value rather than via the first argument.

===C++ alternatives to sprintf for numeric conversion===
The standard method for string formatting and the conversion of other types to strings in C++ is [[iostream]].  Unlike printf, the iostream standard library is type-safe and extensible.

A common programming task is to convert a numeric type into a string (char buffer).  The &lt;code&gt;sprintf&lt;/code&gt; family, while useful, may be overkill for such a simple task. In addition many programs using these are not designed to handle the variations in output when the [[locale]] changes.

A number of alternative means in C/C++ have been developed:
* [http://boost.org/libs/conversion/lexical_cast.htm Boost::lexical_cast ]
* [http://www.boost.org/libs/format/index.html Boost::format ]
* [http://sourceforge.net/projects/loki-lib/ Loki::SafeFormat ]
* [[itoa]] (nonstandard)
* std::to_string ([[C++11]])

==vprintf, vfprintf, vsprintf, vsnprintf, and vasprintf==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
/* va_list versions of above */
int vprintf(const char *format, va_list ap);
int vfprintf(FILE *stream, const char *format, va_list ap);
int vsprintf(char *str, const char *format, va_list ap);
int vsnprintf(char *str, size_t size, const char *format, va_list ap);
int vasprintf(char **ret, const char *format, va_list ap);
&lt;/source&gt;

These are analogous to the above functions without the ''v''s, except that they use [[Variadic function|variable argument]] lists. These functions offer the ability for programmers to essentially create their own printf variants. For instance, a programmer could write a function

 &lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;void fatal_error(const char *format, ...)&lt;/source&gt;

which would use the &lt;code&gt;va_start&lt;/code&gt; macro to obtain a &lt;code&gt;va_list&lt;/code&gt; variable from the extra parameters, print a message on the standard error device using &lt;code&gt;vfprintf&lt;/code&gt;, clean up after the &lt;code&gt;va_list&lt;/code&gt; variable with the &lt;code&gt;va_end&lt;/code&gt; macro, and finally perform the necessary tasks to cleanly shut down the program.

Another common application of these functions is to write a custom printf that prints to a different target than a file. For instance, a graphical library might provide a printf-like function with X and Y coordinates:

 &lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;int graphical_printf(int x, int y, const char *format, ...)&lt;/source&gt;

This would work by temporarily saving the string to a private buffer using &lt;code&gt;vsnprintf&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;vasprintf&lt;/code&gt;.

==Format placeholders==
Formatting takes place via placeholders within the format string. For example, if a program wanted to print out a person's age, it could present the output by prefixing it with &quot;Your age is &quot;. To denote that we want the integer for the age to be shown immediately after that message, we may use the format string:
 &quot;Your age is %d.&quot;

The syntax for a format placeholder is &quot;%[''parameter''][''flags''][''width''][.''precision''][''length'']''type''&quot;.

*'''Parameter''' can be omitted or can be:
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Character
! Description
|-
| &lt;code&gt;n$&lt;/code&gt;
| ''n'' is the number of the parameter to display using this format specifier, allowing the parameters provided to be output multiple times, using varying format specifiers or in different orders. This is a [[POSIX]] extension and not in [[C99]]. Example: &lt;code&gt;printf(&quot;%2$d %2$#x; %1$d %1$#x&quot;,16,17)&lt;/code&gt; produces 
&quot;17 0x11; 16 0x10&quot;
|}

*'''Flags''' can be zero or more (in any order) of:
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Character
! Description
|-
| +
|always denote the sign '+' or '-' of a number (the default is to omit the sign for positive numbers).  Only applicable to numeric types.
|-
| space
|prefixes non-negative signed numbers with a space
|-
| -
|left-align the output of this placeholder (the default is to right-align the output).
|-
| #
| Alternate form. For 'g' and 'G', trailing zeros are not removed. For 'f', 'F', 'e', 'E', 'g', 'G', the output always contains a decimal point. For 'o', 'x', and 'X', a 0, 0x, and 0X, respectively, is prepended to non-zero numbers.
|-
| 0
|use 0 instead of spaces to pad a field when the ''width'' option is specified. For example, &lt;code&gt;printf(&quot;%2d&quot;, 3)&lt;/code&gt; results in &quot;&amp;nbsp;3&quot;, while &lt;code&gt;printf(&quot;%02d&quot;, 3)&lt;/code&gt; results in &quot;03&quot;.
|}

*'''Width''' specifies a ''minimum'' number of characters to output, and is typically used to pad fixed-width fields in tabulated output, where the fields would otherwise be smaller, although it does not cause truncation of oversized fields. A leading zero in the width value is interpreted as the zero-padding flag mentioned above, and a negative value is treated as the positive value in conjunction with the left-alignment &quot;-&quot; flag also mentioned above.
*'''Precision''' usually specifies a ''maximum'' limit on the output, depending on the particular formatting type.  For floating point numeric types, it specifies the number of digits to the right of the decimal point that the output should be rounded.  For the string type, it limits the number of characters that should be output, after which the string is truncated.

*'''Length''' can be omitted or be any of:
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Character
! Description
|-
| &lt;code&gt;hh&lt;/code&gt;
| For integer types, causes &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; to expect an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; sized integer argument which was promoted from a &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;h&lt;/code&gt;
| For integer types, causes &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; to expect an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; sized integer argument which was promoted from a &lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt;.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt;
| For integer types, causes &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; to expect a &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; sized integer argument.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;ll&lt;/code&gt;
| For integer types, causes &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; to expect a &lt;code&gt;long long&lt;/code&gt; sized integer argument.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;L&lt;/code&gt;
| For floating point types, causes &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; to expect a &lt;code&gt;long double&lt;/code&gt; argument.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt;
| For integer types, causes &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; to expect a &lt;code&gt;size_t&lt;/code&gt; sized integer argument.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt;
| For integer types, causes &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; to expect a &lt;code&gt;intmax_t&lt;/code&gt; sized integer argument.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;
| For integer types, causes &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; to expect a &lt;code&gt;ptrdiff_t&lt;/code&gt; sized integer argument.
|}

Additionally, several platform-specific length options came to exist prior to widespread use of the ISO C99 extensions:
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Characters
! Description
|-
| &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;
| For signed integer types, causes &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; to expect &lt;code&gt;ptrdiff_t&lt;/code&gt; sized integer argument; for unsigned integer types, causes &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; to expect &lt;code&gt;size_t&lt;/code&gt; sized integer argument. ''Commonly found in Win32/Win64 platforms.''
|-
| &lt;code&gt;I32&lt;/code&gt;
| For integer types, causes &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; to expect a 32-bit (double word) integer argument.  ''Commonly found in Win32/Win64 platforms.''
|-
| &lt;code&gt;I64&lt;/code&gt;
| For integer types, causes &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; to expect a 64-bit (quad word) integer argument.  ''Commonly found in Win32/Win64 platforms.''
|-
| &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt;
| For integer types, causes &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; to expect a 64-bit (quad word) integer argument.  ''Commonly found in BSD platforms.''
|}

ISO C99 includes the &lt;code&gt;[[inttypes.h]]&lt;/code&gt; header file that includes a number of macros for use in platform-independent &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; coding.  Example macros include:
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Characters
! Description
|-
| &lt;code&gt;PRId32&lt;/code&gt;
| Typically equivalent to &lt;code&gt;I32d&lt;/code&gt; (''Win32/Win64'') or &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;PRId64&lt;/code&gt;
| Typically equivalent to &lt;code&gt;I64d&lt;/code&gt; (''Win32/Win64''), &lt;code&gt;lld&lt;/code&gt; (''32-bit platforms'') or &lt;code&gt;ld&lt;/code&gt; (''64-bit platforms'')
|-
| &lt;code&gt;PRIi32&lt;/code&gt;
| Typically equivalent to &lt;code&gt;I32i&lt;/code&gt; (''Win32/Win64'') or &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;PRIi64&lt;/code&gt;
| Typically equivalent to &lt;code&gt;I64i&lt;/code&gt; (''Win32/Win64''), &lt;code&gt;lli&lt;/code&gt; (''32-bit platforms'') or &lt;code&gt;li&lt;/code&gt; (''64-bit platforms'')
|-
| &lt;code&gt;PRIu32&lt;/code&gt;
| Typically equivalent to &lt;code&gt;I32u&lt;/code&gt; (''Win32/Win64'') or &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;PRIu64&lt;/code&gt;
| Typically equivalent to &lt;code&gt;I64u&lt;/code&gt; (''Win32/Win64''), &lt;code&gt;llu&lt;/code&gt; (''32-bit platforms'') or &lt;code&gt;lu&lt;/code&gt; (''64-bit platforms'')
|-
| &lt;code&gt;PRIx64&lt;/code&gt;
| Typically equivalent to &lt;code&gt;I64x&lt;/code&gt; (''Win32/Win64''), &lt;code&gt;llx&lt;/code&gt; (''32-bit platforms'') or &lt;code&gt;lx&lt;/code&gt; (''64-bit platforms'')
|}

*'''Type''' can be any of:
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Character
! Description
|-
| &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; as a signed [[decimal]] number. '&lt;code&gt;%d&lt;/code&gt;' and '&lt;code&gt;%i&lt;/code&gt;' are synonymous for output, but are different when used with &lt;code&gt;[[scanf]]()&lt;/code&gt; for input.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;
| Print decimal &lt;code&gt;unsigned int&lt;/code&gt;.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;F&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; in normal ([[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]]) notation. 'f' and 'F' only differs in how the strings for an infinite number or NaN are printed ('inf', 'infinity' and 'nan' for 'f', 'INF', 'INFINITY' and 'NAN' for 'F').
|-
| &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; value in standard form ([-]d.ddd e[+/-]ddd). An E conversion uses the letter E (rather than e) to introduce the exponent.  The exponent always contains at least two digits; if the value is zero, the exponent is 00. In Windows, the exponent contains three digits by default, e.g. 1.5e002, but this can be altered by Microsoft-specific &lt;code&gt;_set_output_format&lt;/code&gt; function.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;G&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; in either normal or exponential notation, whichever is more appropriate for its magnitude. 'g' uses lower-case letters, 'G' uses upper-case letters.  This type differs slightly from fixed-point notation in that insignificant zeroes to the right of the decimal point are not included.  Also, the decimal point is not included on whole numbers.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;unsigned int&lt;/code&gt; as a [[hexadecimal]] number. 'x' uses lower-case letters and 'X' uses upper-case.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;unsigned int&lt;/code&gt; in octal.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;
|[[null-terminated string]].
|-
| &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; (character).
|-
| &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;void *&lt;/code&gt; (pointer to void) in an implementation-defined format.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;
| Print nothing, but write number of characters successfully written so far into an integer pointer parameter.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;
|a literal '%' character (this type doesn't accept any flags, width, precision or length).
|}

The width and precision formatting parameters may be omitted, or they can be a fixed number embedded in the format string, or passed as another function argument when indicated by an asterisk &quot;*&quot; in the format string.  For example &lt;code&gt;printf(&quot;%*d&quot;, 5, 10)&lt;/code&gt; will result in &lt;code&gt;&quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;10&quot;&lt;/code&gt; being printed, with a total width of 5 characters, and &lt;code&gt;printf(&quot;%.*s&quot;, 3, &quot;abcdef&quot;)&lt;/code&gt; will result in &quot;abc&quot; being printed.

If the [[syntax]] of a conversion specification is invalid, behavior is undefined, and can cause program termination.  
If there are too few [[function argument]]s provided to supply values for all the conversion specifications in the template string, or if the arguments are not of the correct types, the results are also undefined. Excess arguments are ignored. In a number of cases, the undefined behavior has led to &quot;[[Format string attack]]&quot; security [[Exploit (computer science)|vulnerabilities]].

Some compilers, like [[GNU Compiler Collection|the GNU Compiler Collection]], will statically check the format strings of printf-like functions and warn about problems (when using the flags &lt;code&gt;-Wall&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-Wformat&lt;/code&gt;). GCC will also warn about user-defined printf-style functions if the non-standard &quot;format&quot; __attribute__ is applied to the function.

==Risks of using field width versus explicit delimiters in tabular output==
Using only field widths to provide for tabulation, as with a format like &quot;&lt;code&gt;%8d%8d%8d&lt;/code&gt;&quot; for three integers in three 8-character columns, will not guarantee that field separation will be retained if large numbers occur in the data.  Loss of field separation can easily lead to corrupt output. In systems which encourage the use of programs as building blocks in scripts, such corrupt data can often be forwarded into and corrupt further processing, regardless of whether the original programmer expected the output would only be read by human eyes. Such problems can be eliminated by including explicit delimiters, even spaces, in all tabular output formats.  Simply changing the dangerous example from before to &quot;&lt;code&gt; %7d %7d %7d&lt;/code&gt;&quot; addresses this, formatting identically until numbers become larger, but then explicitly preventing them from becoming merged on output due to the explicitly-included spaces.  Similar strategies apply to string data.

==Custom format placeholders==
There are a few implementations of &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;-like functions that allow extensions to the [[escape character|escape-character]]-based [[Domain-specific programming language|mini-language]], thus allowing the programmer to have a specific formatting function for non-builtin types.  One of the most well-known is the (now deprecated) [[glibc|glibc's]] &lt;code&gt;[http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Customizing-Printf.html register_printf_function()]&lt;/code&gt;.  However, it is rarely used due to the fact that it conflicts with static format string checking.  Another is [http://www.and.org/vstr/#cust-fmt Vstr custom formatters], which allows adding multi-character format names, and can work with static format checkers.

Some applications (like the [[Apache HTTP Server]]) include their own &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;-like function, and embed extensions into it. However these all tend to have the same problems that &lt;code&gt;register_printf_function()&lt;/code&gt; has.

Most non-C languages that have a &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;-like function work around the lack of this feature by just using the &quot;&lt;code&gt;%s&lt;/code&gt;&quot; format and converting the object to a string representation. [[C++]] offers a notable exception, in that it has a &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; function inherited from its C history, but also has a completely different mechanism that is preferred.

The length of [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Bestiary_of_Behavioral_Economics/Self-Interest&amp;diff=2185268&amp;oldid=2185263 this version] seems about right.

The '''C POSIX library''' is a language-independent library (using C [[calling convention]]s) that adds functions specific to POSIX systems. POSIX (and [[Single Unix Specification|SUS]]) specifies a number of routines that should be available over and above those in the C standard library proper. It was developed at the same time as the ANSI C standard and is closely related to C. Some effort was made to make the C and POSIX libraries compatible, but there are a few POSIX functions that were never introduced into ANSI C. 

Facilities are often implemented alongside the [[C standard library]] functionality, with varying degrees of closeness. For example, [[glibc]] implements functions such as [[Fork (operating system)|fork]] within libc.so, but before [[NPTL]] was merged into glibc it constituted a separate library with its own linker flag. Often, this POSIX-specified functionality will be regarded as part of the library; the C library proper may be identified as the [[ANSI]] or [[ISO]] C library.

The '''&lt;code&gt;getaddrinfo()&lt;/code&gt;''' and &lt;code&gt;getnameinfo()&lt;/code&gt; [[function (computer science)|function]]s are part of the [[POSIX]] standard [[application programming interface]] (API) for converting [[domain name system]] (DNS) [[hostname]]s and IP addresses between their human-readable text representations and structured binary formats for the [[operating system]]'s networking API.

&lt;tt&gt;getaddrinfo()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;getnameinfo()&lt;/tt&gt; are inverse functions of each other.

This set of functions is fully network protocol agnostic and supports both [[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]]. It is the recommended interface for name resolution in building protocol independent applications and for transitioning legacy IPv4 code to the IPv6 Internet.

==struct addrinfo==
The [[C (programming language)|C]] data structure used to represent addresses and hostnames within the networking API is the following:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
struct addrinfo {
    int     ai_flags;
    int     ai_family;
    int     ai_socktype;
    int     ai_protocol;
    size_t  ai_addrlen;
    struct  sockaddr *ai_addr;
    char    *ai_canonname;     /* canonical name */
    struct  addrinfo *ai_next; /* this struct can form a linked list */
};
&lt;/source&gt;

In recent operating systems the type of ai_addrlen has been changed from size_t to socklen_t. Most socket functions, such as accept and getpeername, require a socklen_t* parameter and programmers often pass the address to the ai_addrlen element of the addrinfo structure. If the types are incompatible, e.g., on a big-endian 64-bit Solaris 9 system where size_t is 8 bytes and socklen_t is 4 bytes, then run-time errors may result.

==getaddrinfo()==
&lt;tt&gt;getaddrinfo()&lt;/tt&gt; converts human-readable text strings representing [[hostname]]s or [[IP address]]es into a [[Dynamic memory allocation|dynamically allocated]] [[linked list]] of &lt;tt&gt;struct addrinfo&lt;/tt&gt; structures. An application can deallocate these linked lists with the &lt;tt&gt;freeaddrinfo()&lt;/tt&gt; function.
The function prototypes for these functions are specified as follows:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
#include &lt;netdb.h&gt;

int getaddrinfo(const char *node,
                const char *service,
                const struct addrinfo *hints,
                struct addrinfo **res);

void freeaddrinfo(struct addrinfo *res);
&lt;/source&gt;

==getnameinfo()==
&lt;tt&gt;getnameinfo()&lt;/tt&gt; converts the internal binary representation of an IP address in the form of a &lt;tt&gt;struct sockaddr&lt;/tt&gt; pointer into text strings consisting of the hostname or, if the address cannot be resolved into a name, a textual IP address representation, as well as the service port name or number. The function prototype is specified as follows:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
#include &lt;netdb.h&gt;

int getnameinfo(const struct sockaddr *sa, socklen_t salen,
                char *host, size_t hostlen,
                char *serv, size_t servlen,
                int flags);
&lt;/source&gt;

==Example==
The following example uses &lt;tt&gt;getaddrinfo()&lt;/tt&gt; to resolve the domain name ''www.example.com'' into its list of addresses and then calls &lt;tt&gt;getnameinfo()&lt;/tt&gt; on each result to return the canonical name for the address. In general, this will produce the original [[hostname]], unless the particular address has multiple names, in which case the ''canonical'' name is returned. In this example, the domain name will be printed three times, once for each of the three results obtained.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;netdb.h&gt;
#include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

#ifndef   NI_MAXHOST
#define   NI_MAXHOST 1025
#endif

int main(void)
{
    struct addrinfo *result;
    struct addrinfo *res;
    int error;

    /* resolve the domain name into a list of addresses */
    error = getaddrinfo(&quot;www.example.com&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;result);
    if (error != 0)
    {   
        fprintf(stderr, &quot;error in getaddrinfo: %s\n&quot;, gai_strerror(error));
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }   

    /* loop over all returned results and do inverse lookup */
    for (res = result; res != NULL; res = res-&gt;ai_next)
    {   
        char hostname[NI_MAXHOST] = &quot;&quot;;

        error = getnameinfo(res-&gt;ai_addr, res-&gt;ai_addrlen, hostname, NI_MAXHOST, NULL, 0, 0); 
        if (error != 0)
        {
            fprintf(stderr, &quot;error in getnameinfo: %s\n&quot;, gai_strerror(error));
            continue;
        }
        if (*hostname != '\0')
            printf(&quot;hostname: %s\n&quot;, hostname);
    }   

    freeaddrinfo(result);
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{dewikify}}
The '''write''' system call writes data, in bytes as specified by the caller, from a buffer declared by the user in the program and then writes it into the file supplied by the calling process.
In most modern [[w:operating systems| operating system]], a program that needs to write data to a file stored in a [[w:filesystem| filesystem]] uses the Write system call. The file is identified by the [[w:file descriptor| file descriptor]] that is obtained from a previous call to [[C Programming/POSIX Reference/unistd.h/open|open]].

Write, thus, takes three arguments:
# The file descriptor of the file ('''fd''').
# The buffer from where data is to be written into the file ('''buf''').
# The number of bytes to be read from the buffer ('''nbytes''').

==POSIX usage==

The write system call interface&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unix.com/man-page/FreeBSD/2/write/ Manual page for Write&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gnu.org/s/hello/manual/libc/I_002fO-Primitives.html#I_002fO-Primitives I/O Primitives&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904875/functions/write.html&lt;/ref&gt; is standardized by the POSIX specification. Data is written to a file by calling the write function. The function prototype is :

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt; size_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t nbytes);&lt;/source&gt;

{| class = 'wikitable'
|-
!   Argument  !! Description
|-
|| &lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;&quot;&gt;'''fd'''&lt;/div&gt; || It is the file descriptor which has been obtained from the call to open. It is an integer value. The values 0, 1, 2 can also be given, for standard input, standard output &amp; standard error, respectively .
|-
|| &lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;&quot;&gt;'''buf'''&lt;/div&gt; || It points to a character array, which can be used to store content obtained from the file pointed to by fd.
|-
|| &lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;&quot;&gt;'''nbytes'''&lt;/div&gt; || It specifies the number of bytes to be written from the file into the character array.
|}

In above syntax, &lt;code&gt;[[w:size_t| size_t]]&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;[[w:typedef| typedef]]&lt;/code&gt;. It is unsigned data type defined in &lt;code&gt;[[w:stddef.h| stddef.h]]&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;[[w:sizeof| sizeof]]&lt;/code&gt; operator produces an integer value which is of this type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The C programming language. Brian Kernighan &amp; Dennis Ritchie|publisher=PHI Learning Private Limited|location=India|isbn=978-81-203-0596-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;
The write function returns the number of bytes successfully written into the array, which may at times be less than the specified '''nbytes'''. It returns -1 if [[w:EOF| EOF]] is encountered.

== Usage Example ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int fd1;
    char buf[128];
    fd1 = open(argv[1], O_WRONLY);
    if (fd1 == -1) {
        perror(&quot;File cannot be opened&quot;);
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    /* Enter the data to be written into the file */
    scanf(&quot;%127s&quot;, buf);
   
    write(fd1, buf, strlen(buf)); /* fd1 is the file descriptor, buf is the character array used to 
 hold the data, strlen(buf) informs the function that the number of bytes equal to the length of the 
 string in the buffer need to be copied */
 
    return 0;
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

      <comment>http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms686298(v=VS.85).aspx - &quot;To enter an alertable wait state, use the SleepEx function.&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A [[computer program]] ([[process (computing)|process]], [[task (computers)|task]], or [[Thread (computer science)|thread]]) may '''sleep''', which places it into an [[process state|inactive state]] for a period of time. Eventually the expiration of an interval [[timer]], or the receipt of a [[signal (computing)|signal]] or [[interrupt]] causes the program to resume execution.

== Usage ==
A typical ''sleep'' [[system call]] takes a time value as a parameter, specifying the minimum amount of time that the process is to sleep before resuming execution. The parameter typically specifies seconds, although some operating systems provide finer resolution, such as milliseconds or microseconds.

=== Windows ===
On Windows 2000 and newer, the &lt;code&gt;Sleep()&lt;/code&gt; [[function (computer science)|function]] takes a single parameter of the number of milliseconds to sleep.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms686298(VS.85).aspx MSDN Library Reference - Sleep()]&lt;/ref&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;sleep()&lt;/code&gt; function is included in the [[kernel32.dll]], but no sleep command ([[executable]]) is natively available for scripts ([[batch files]]). It can be found in collections of Windows utilities like Windows 2003 Resource Kit.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://malektips.com/xp_dos_0002.html batch file sleep command]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unix ===
On [[Unix-like]] operating systems, the &lt;code&gt;sleep()&lt;/code&gt; function is called providing a single parameter of type unsigned integer of the number of seconds to sleep.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibm5.ma.utexas.edu/cgi-bin/man-cgi?sleep+3 UNIX Man Page - SLEEP(3)]&lt;/ref&gt; (For more precise sleep times one can use the &lt;code&gt;usleep()&lt;/code&gt; function.)
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manpagez.com/man/3/usleep/ UNIX Man Page - usleep(3)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== C examples ===
In Windows OS:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
while (myInt &lt;= 100)
{
    Sleep(2*1000);  // Sleep for 2 seconds
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In Unix:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
while (myInt &lt;= 100)
{
    sleep(2);       // Sleep for 2 seconds
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Low level functionality ==
Sleep causes the thread or process to enter the '''Not Runnable''' state. This allows the CPU to suspend the thread or process and continue executing other threads or processes until the sleep has finished, and the thread or process is allowed to continue executing. On Windows systems the sleep system call is non-interruptible, which differs from [[Wait (system call)|Wait]] and &lt;tt&gt;SleepEx&lt;/tt&gt; system calls, which can be interrupted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jguru.com/faq/view.jsp?EID=47127 Sleep vs. Wait (1)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1036754/difference-between-wait-and-sleep Sleep vs. Wait (2)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, some functions labeled sleep() are alterable by design&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms686307.aspx SleepEx MSDN]&lt;/ref&gt;. On Unix system signals interrupt system calls, including sleep().&lt;ref&gt;[http://linux.die.net/man/3/sleep sleep(3) Linux man Page]&lt;/ref&gt; Sleep often leads to poor code design and the wait or nanosleep functions are preferable.

== Uses ==
Some [[daemon (computer software)|system programs]] that never terminate execute an [[event loop]], going to sleep at the start of each cycle and waiting for some event to awaken them. Once an event is received, the program services the event, then returns to the beginning of the next wait cycle.

Other programs periodically [[polling (computer science)|poll]] for events by going to sleep and resuming execution after a specific interval of time. Once execution is resumed, the program polls for events or status changes, and then services any that occurred while it was asleep. After servicing the events, the program then goes to sleep again for the next time interval. Certain kinds of ''[[watchdog timer|heartbeat]]'' events or ''keep-alive'' signals can be generated by these kinds of programs.

=== Uninterruptible sleep ===
An uninterruptible sleep state is a sleep state that won't handle a signal right away. It will wake only as a result of &lt;!-- a hardware interrupt or of --&gt;a waited-upon resource becoming available or after a time-out occurs during that wait (if specified when put to sleep). It is mostly used by device drivers waiting for disk or network IO (input/output).
&lt;!--
The kernel ''could'' conceivably wake such processes under other circumstances (e.g. a hardware interrupt's handler could decide to wake up a specific process), but that would almost certainly make no sense.
--&gt;
When the process is sleeping uninterruptibly, signals accumulated during the sleep will be noticed when the process returns from the system call or trap.

In Unix-like systems the command 'ps -l' uses code &quot;D&quot; for the uninterruptible sleep state of a process.

&lt;!-- Commenting this out as it is certainly untrue of Linux 2.6.35-24 :

Such processes cannot be killed even with 'kill -9' command, and the only nonsophisticated way to get rid of them is to reboot the system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;code&gt;stat()&lt;/code&gt;''' is a [[Unix]] [[system call]] that returns useful data about a file [[inode]].  The semantics of &lt;code&gt;stat()&lt;/code&gt; vary between [[operating system]]s. As an example, the [[Unix]] command [[ls]] uses it to retrieve information on (among many others):
*{{visible anchor|mtime:}} [[time_t|time]] of last modification (&lt;code&gt;ls -l&lt;/code&gt;),
*{{visible anchor|ctime:}} time of last status change (&lt;code&gt;ls -lc&lt;/code&gt;) and
*{{visible anchor|atime:}} time of last access (&lt;code&gt;ls -lu&lt;/code&gt;).

==stat() functions and stat structure ==
The [[POSIX]] [[C POSIX library|library header]] &lt;code&gt;sys/stat.h&lt;/code&gt;, found on all POSIX-compliant and [[Unix-like]] operating systems, declares the &lt;code&gt;stat()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fstat()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;lstat()&lt;/code&gt; routines:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 int stat(const char *filename, struct stat *buf);
 int lstat(const char *filename, struct stat *buf);
 int fstat(int filedesc, struct stat *buf);
&lt;/source&gt;

and defines the &lt;code&gt;struct stat&lt;/code&gt; structure as including at least the following members:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
     dev_t       st_dev;     /* ID of device containing file */
     ino_t       st_ino;     /* inode number */
     mode_t      st_mode;    /* protection */
     nlink_t     st_nlink;   /* number of hard links */
     uid_t       st_uid;     /* user ID of owner */
     gid_t       st_gid;     /* group ID of owner */
     dev_t       st_rdev;    /* device ID (if special file) */
     off_t       st_size;    /* total size, in bytes */
     time_t      st_atime;   /* time of last access */
     time_t      st_mtime;   /* time of last modification */
     time_t      st_ctime;   /* time of last status change */
     blksize_t   st_blksize; /* blocksize for filesystem I/O */
     blkcnt_t    st_blocks;  /* number of blocks allocated */
&lt;/source&gt;

== Related functions ==
===lstat()===
'''&lt;code&gt;lstat()&lt;/code&gt;''' is a [[Function (computer science)|library function]] that retrieves the status of a [[computer file|file]]. It is identical to &lt;code&gt;stat()&lt;/code&gt;, except when the file is a [[symbolic link]], in which case information about the link itself is returned instead of the linked-to file.

===fstat()===
'''&lt;code&gt;fstat()&lt;/code&gt;''' is a [[Function (computer science)|library function]] that retrieves the status of a file.  It is identical to &lt;code&gt;stat()&lt;/code&gt; except that the file's identity is passed as a [[file descriptor]] instead of as a [[filename]].

== Criticism of atime ==
Writing to a file changes its &lt;code&gt;mtime&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ctime&lt;/code&gt;, while reading a file changes its &lt;code&gt;atime&lt;/code&gt;. As a result, on a POSIX-compliant system, ''reading'' a file causes a ''write,'' which has been criticized. This behaviour can usually be disabled by adding a mount option in [[/etc/fstab]].

However, turning off atime updating breaks [[POSIX]] compliance, and some applications, notably the mutt mail reader (in some configurations), and some file usage watching utilities, notably tmpwatch. In the worst case, not updating atime can cause some backup programs to fail to backup a file.

Linux kernel developer [[Ingo Molnár]] called atime &quot;perhaps the most stupid Unix design idea of all times,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kernel Trap: [http://archive.is/20120715000041/kerneltrap.org/node/14148 Linux: Replacing atime With relatime], by Jeremy, August 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lwn.net/Articles/244829/ Once upon atime], LWN, by Jonathan Corbet, August 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; adding: &quot;[T]hink about this a bit: 'For every file that is read from the disk, lets do a ... write to the disk! And, for every file that is already cached and which we read from the cache ... do a write to the disk!'&quot;
He further emphasized the performance impact thus:
:Atime updates are by far the biggest IO performance deficiency that Linux has today. Getting rid of atime updates would give us more everyday Linux performance than all the pagecache speedups of the past 10 years, _combined_.

=== Solutions ===
Current versions of [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]], and [[OpenBSD]] support a &lt;code&gt;{{visible anchor|noatime}}&lt;/code&gt; mount option, which causes the atime field never to be updated.  This breaks compliance with POSIX.

Current versions of Linux support four mount options, which can be specified in [[fstab]]:
* &lt;code&gt;strictatime&lt;/code&gt; (formerly atime, and formerly the default; strictatime as of 2.6.30) – always update atime.
* &lt;code&gt;relatime&lt;/code&gt; – (relative atime), introduced in 2.6.20 and the default as of 2.6.30
* &lt;code&gt;nodiratime&lt;/code&gt; – do not update atime of directories ever
* &lt;code&gt;noatime&lt;/code&gt; – do not update atime ever; includes nodiratime; highest performance, least compatible

&lt;code&gt;strictatime&lt;/code&gt; accords with POSIX; [[Alan Cox]] described the alternatives as:
:Turn off atime and it is very non standards compliant, turn to relatime and it is not standards compliant but nobody will break (which is good)

File systems mounted with the &lt;code&gt;noatime&lt;/code&gt; option do not update the atime on reads, and the &lt;code&gt;relatime&lt;/code&gt; option provides for updates only if the previous atime is older than the mtime or ctime, or the previous atime is over 24 hours in the past. Many users use &lt;code&gt;noatime&lt;/code&gt; without problem, so long as they do not use an application which depends on atime, and this offers some benefits over &lt;code&gt;relatime&lt;/code&gt; (no writing of atime ever on read).

As of 2.6.30 (9 June 2009), Linux defaults to &lt;code&gt;relatime&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_30 Linux 2 6 30], Linux Kernel Newbies&lt;/ref&gt; so that it will not update atime on all file reads. The behavior offers sufficient performance for most purposes and should not break any significant applications. Extended discussion of filesystem performance preceded decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lwn.net/Articles/326471/ That massive filesystem thread], LWN, by Jonathan Corbet, March 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, &lt;code&gt;relatime&lt;/code&gt; by default was the first patch Linux applied following the 2.6.29 release. In initial patches &lt;code&gt;relatime&lt;/code&gt; only updated atime if atime &lt; mtime or atime &lt; ctime; this was subsequently modified to update atimes that were 24 hours old or older, so that tmpwatch and Debian's popularity counter (popcon) would behave properly.

See further discussion at the references.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.koolwal.net/2009/01/30/installing-linux-on-usb-part-4-noatime-and-relatime-mount-options/ Installing Linux on USB – Part 4: noatime and relatime mount options]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://valerieaurora.wordpress.com/2009/03/27/relatime-recap/ Relatime Recap], Valerie Aurora&lt;/ref&gt;

== ctime ==
Note that &lt;code&gt;ctime&lt;/code&gt; has nothing to do with file creation time. It is updated any time file content changes (together with &lt;code&gt;mtime&lt;/code&gt;), and also by changes in metadata such as [[chmod|file permissions]], [[chown|file ownership]], and [[hard link|creation and deletion of hard links]]. In some implementations, &lt;code&gt;ctime&lt;/code&gt; is affected by renaming a file (both original Unix and modern Linux tend to do this).

Unlike &lt;code&gt;atime&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mtime&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ctime&lt;/code&gt; cannot be set with &lt;code&gt;utime()&lt;/code&gt; (as used e.g. by &lt;code&gt;[[touch (unix)|touch]]&lt;/code&gt;); the only way to set it to an arbitrary value is by changing the system clock.

==Granularity of mtime etc.==

[[time_t]] provides times accurate to 1 second.

Some filesystems provide greater granularity.  In linux kernels 2.5.48 and above, the stat structure supports nanosecond resolution for the three file timestamp fields.  These are exposed as additional fields in the stat structure.

The FAT filesystem provides timestamps with a granularity of 2 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/948770/how-accurate-is-ruby-mtime-and-friends How accurate is ruby mtime and friends] at StackOverflow.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== February reviews ==
===CBR13 review ===
There are some long sentences that conflict with one's ability to understand. For example:
{{cquote|It is important to point out, however, that they are not entirely a necessity, works can also be released in the public domain (today rarely done, due to changes to the copyright law that makes it unappealing), or preserving the copyrights freely licensed to use, reuse and distribute.}}

Try not to editorialize: &quot;It is sadly very rare today...&quot;

It would probably be more helpful if there were sub-sections under &quot;Patents&quot; and &quot;Copyright&quot;. Otherwise it just seems like a giant/overwhelming blob of information. 
Sub-sections of &quot;Patents&quot; could be: Definition of a Patent, Granting a Patent, Problems Associated with Patents.
Sub-sections of &quot;Copyright&quot; could be: Definition, Copyrights and the Internet, Copyrights and Profitabilty, Legal Struggles
Also, under Copyrights, &quot;the origins of copyright law in the late 18th century in Germany&quot; is not elaborated on, though it seems to be an important example of the problem of legal struggles.

===Reditor1214 review===
While the information that is given in this section is very useful, it would be more useful to a reader if organized in a better manner. The two subsections of Patents and Copyrights are introduced well however it seems that the last paragraph of the introduction would be better suited to actually be apart of the Patent subsection.
With regard to the content already in the Patent subsection, more information on how to be granted a patent would be useful. Also the section following that seems to deal with the downside of both patents and copyrights and perhaps warrants its own subsection.
With regard to the information in the copyright subsection, the last two paragraphs seem to do with IP in general and perhaps better belong at the beginning of this article. 
By reorganizing this information and keeping the subsections detailed and specific, it will become much easier for readers to extract useful information.

== TDang review April 2012 ==

I'm reviewing [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Intellectual_Property&amp;diff=2312716&amp;oldid=2312714 this version]. I'll likely be more critical than complimentary, because (a) that's the way I am and (b) that's what will help improve things. Please don't take the criticism-over-compliments to mean I have a wholly negative view.

Make sure to check the [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#review_thoughts_April_2012|all-purpose review thoughts]] as well.

* Use wiki-formatting for sections and sub-sections, not just putting sub-section titles in bold.
* In the first paragraph, I think there's some quotations missing or mixed up.
* ''Trademarks''--There is good material on trademarks here, but it's a distraction from the goal of this book. Copyrights and patents (and potentially trade secrets) are close to the same thing from an economist's point of view, while trademarks are something else entirely--essentially the purpose of a trademark is to prevent fraud. So trademarks should get a really fast mention, and explanation that they'll be ignored for the rest of the article.
* ''&quot;If no such intellectual property laws were in existence then the incentive to create new products would not exist&quot;''--This is the ''argument for'' intellectual property, but it clearly isn't entirely true since people do create creative works without IP protection (now and in the past) or create works with IP protection which they don't use for profit. So, the statement is too strong. Also, the statement inspires a rebuttal right after it. I'd recommend pulling the statement out or maybe rephrasing it in terms of intent (but I think intent is already covered). Then, the rebuttals can also be removed.
* ''&quot;since they not only provide protection to the creator, but can be used strategically to prevent competition.''&quot; This doesn't belong in the introduction, and may not belong anywhere. Copyrights and patents are explicitly set up with the purpose of preventing competition, so that's not a negative side-effect, it's part of the intent. If it's meant in a different way (perhaps in terms of [[w:patent thickets|patent thickets]]) then, it should be moved to another section, carefully referenced, and discussed.
* Overall, the final paragraph of the introduction needs to be removed or re-worked. It's making some anti-patent arguments, which could be made, but in other ways:
*# First, rather than the book making anti-IP arguments, the anti-IP arguments should be attributed to someone important who makes them. Several economists and many other cultural commentators criticize aspects of current IP law, and so there can be references found for this.
*# If it's in the introduction, it should be very brief, perhaps instead it should be its own section.
* ''Patents section''
** This is a little too long, providing more detail than we need. For instance, I think the ''&quot;Who Can Apply For Patents&quot;'' section is unnecessary for our purposes.
** ''Economic Benefits of Patents''--this part should be removed, as it's part of the overall discussion and doesn't need to be separated from the discussion of copyright. It also risks falling onto one side of the debate of how necessary patents are.
** ''Patent Infringement and Punishments''--This section is more detail than is needed for this book, up to the part where it gets to ''&quot;In the absence of patents and other intellectual property law,...&quot;'', which is again talking about the benefits of patent law and should be moved to wherever that winds up.
** ''Requirements for Patentability''--This has some plagiarism/copyright violations within it. The source used was cited, so I'm sure it was an honest mistake. However, the quotes/paraphrases were much too close to the original. I suggestion dealing with this by radically cutting down on the detail for each of these requirements. Unless you see an obvious bit of '''economic importance''' to a legal detail you're including, it's just as well to leave the legal detail out.
** ''Real World Application of Patent Law''--This is good stuff, but it should be separated into a section discussing possible drawbacks to patent law (and it appears what he called &quot;gridlock&quot; is what is commonly referred to as a &quot;patent thicket&quot; problem).
** ''Importance of Patents''--again, this is talking about patent thickets.
** 'Opposition and Proposed Alternatives to Patents''--This needs a lot better referencing, or to be removed:
*** There's no reference to where Bessen makes these suggestions.
*** For instance, I'm aware of a lot of criticism of intellectual property, but I don't recall anyone suggesting that trade secrets are preferable, so that needs a reference or removal.
* ''Copyrights section''
** reference links to http://www.copyright.gov/ need to point to the specific place where the information is.
** &quot;''Copyrights are said to be territorial, which means that they do not extend beyond the territory of a specific state unless that state is a party to an international agreement. Today, however, this is less relevant...&quot;''--so don't mention it.
** I moved some of the piracy stuff to the [[Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Piracy|piracy]] page.
** ''&quot;There are many things that a holder of protected IP has to consider when trying to make as much of a profit as possible.&quot;''--This paragraph is largely about '''costs'' and so should probably become the basis of a separate section on costs. Otherwise, the paragraph is a bit confused and I'm not sure what points it's trying to make.
** ''Copyleft''--this should probably move to [[Strategy for Information Markets/Non-IP approaches to innovation|Non-IP approaches to innovation]]
* ''References''
** I think Stanford Encyclopedia is a good reference, it should be properly referenced in addition to being mentioned.
** I added a &quot;References&quot; section to the bottom. Try to format your references so they appear as more than links and numbers.
** Reference links to uspto.gov need to not be to the main page, but to the page which provides the information used.
** Quasi-rent--Wikipedia isn't an adequate reference.
[[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TDang|contribs]]) 19:52, 29 April 2012 (UTC)
* ''What's missing''
** This page needs more economics, which would ideally include formal models and graphics, but in any acse, more economics.
** That means focusing on the efficiency trade-off: A monopoly is economically inefficient in the static sense that it leads to high prices and less of the thing being consumed than &quot;should&quot; be. However, IP accepts that inefficiency as the price to be paid for motivating the creation of the thing in the first place.
** It's worth considering how unlikely it is that every copyrighted thing should get the same amount of IP protection to maximize efficiency. (Or every copyrighted thing.)
** There are some attempts to identify the optimal length of a patent and copyright.
** Talking about the passage of the [[w:Copyright Term Extension Act|Copyright Term Extension Act]] would be worthwhile. Almost every economist agrees the law was economically inefficient, and a case of successful [[w:rent seeking|rent seeking]]. Since it was retroactive, talking about it can also help clarify the issues of before-creation incentives versus after-creation monopoly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Spawn''' refers to a function that loads and [[execution (computers)|executes]] a new [[child process]].
The [[parent process|current process]] may or may not continue to execute asynchronously. Creating a new subprocess requires enough memory in which both the child process and the current program can execute.

There is a family of '''spawn''' functions in the [[Microsoft Windows]] line of [[operating system]]s.
There is also a different family of '''spawn''' functions in an optional extension of the [[POSIX]] standards
&lt;ref name=&quot;Posix spawn.h&quot;&gt;[http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/spawn.h.html Posix.1-2008 spawn.h]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Different versions==
The [[Microsoft Windows]] spawn functions are inspired by [[Unix]] functions [[Fork_(operating_system)|fork]] and [[exec (operating system)|exec]]; however, as Windows does not support fork (at least in the [[Win32 API]]; [[POSIX]] emulation environments such as [[Cygwin]] or [[Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX|SFU]] do), the spawn function was supplied as a replacement for the fork-exec combination. However, the spawn function, although it deals adequately with the most common use cases, lacks the full power of fork-exec, since after fork any process settings which will survive an exec may be changed. However, in most cases, this deficiency can be made up for by using the more low-level CreateProcess API.

The Posix spawn functions were introduced to enable support for processes in Posix implementations for embedded environments that don't support swapping or dynamic address translation &lt;ref name=&quot;Posix posix_spawn&quot;&gt;[http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/posix_spawn.html Posix.1-2008 posix_spawn function]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Microsoft Windows spawn functions==

In the ''spawnl'', ''spawnlp'', ''spawnv'', and ''spawnvp'' calls, the child process inherits the environment of the parent.  Files that are open when a ''spawn'' call is made remain open in the child process.

===Prototype===
:&lt;code&gt;int spawnl(int mode, char *path, char *arg0, ...);&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;int spawnle(int mode, char *path, char *arg0, ..., char ** envp);&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;int spawnlp(int mode, char *path, char *arg0, ...);&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;int spawnlpe(int mode, char *path, char *arg0, ..., char ** envp);&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;int spawnv(int mode, char *path, char **argv);&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;int spawnve(int mode, char *path, char **argv, char ** envp);&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;int spawnvp(int mode, char *path, char **argv);&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;int spawnvpe(int mode, char *path, char **argv, char ** envp);&lt;/code&gt;

====Function names====
The base name of each function is '''spawn''', followed by one or more letters:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Name||Notes
|-
|e||An array of pointers to environment arguments is explicitly passed to the child process. 
|-
|l||Command line arguments are passed individually to the function. 
|-
|p||Uses the PATH argument variable to find the file to be executed. 
|-
|v||Command line arguments are passed to the function as an array of pointers.
|-
|}

====Mode====
The ''mode'' argument determines the way the child is run. Values for ''mode'' are:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Name || Notes
|-
|P_OVERLAY||Overlays parent process with child, which destroys the parent. This has the same effect as the exec* functions.
|-
|P_WAIT||Suspends parent process until the child process has finished executing (synchronous spawn).
|-
|P_NOWAIT, P_NOWAITO||Continues to execute calling process concurrently with new process (asynchronous spawn).
|-
|P_DETACH||the child is run in background without access to the console or keyboard. Calls to _cwait upon the new process will fail (asynchronous spawn) 
|-
|}

====Path====
The ''path'' argument specifies the filename of the program to execute. For ''spawnlp'' and ''spawnvp'' only, if the filename does not have a path and is not in the current directory, the [[Path (variable)|PATH environment variable]] determines which directories to search for the file. The string pointed to by ''argv''[0] is the name of the program to run.

The command line passed to the spawned program is made up of the character strings, ''arg0'' through ''argn'', in the ''spawn'' call. The accepted maximum combined length of these strings differs between compilers, ranging from 128 characters on Digital Mars&lt;ref name=&quot;mars process.h&quot;&gt;[http://www.digitalmars.com/rtl/process.html Digital Mars process.h]&lt;/ref&gt; to 1024 on Microsoft Visual C++&lt;ref name=&quot;msdn&quot;&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vccore98/HTML/_crt_system.2c_._wsystem.asp Microsoft MSDN]&lt;/ref&gt; or
as much as memory permits, on DJGPP.&lt;ref name=&quot;djgpp spawn&quot;&gt;[http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/libc/libc_736.html DJGPP spawn*]&lt;/ref&gt;. The last argument after argn has to be a NULL pointer.

====argv====
The ''argv'' argument is an array of character pointers. The last pointer in the array must be null to indicate the end of the list.

====envp====
The ''spawnle'', ''spawnlpe'', ''spawnve'', and ''spawnvpe'' calls allow the user to alter the child process's environment by passing a list of environment settings in the ''envp'' argument. This argument is an array of character pointers; each pointer (except for the last one) points to a null-terminated string defining an environment variable. An environment variable has the form:
:''name''=''value''
where ''name'' is the variable name and ''value'' is its value. The last pointer in the array is null. When the ''envp'' argument is null, the child inherits the parent's environment settings.

The ''spawn'' functions can be used under Microsoft Windows. They use LoadModule to run the spawned process. If this fails, an attempt is made to spawn a normal MS-DOS process. If a Windows application is spawned, the instance handle can be obtained using ''exec_instancehandleget''. It is possible to specify how the spawned program will be shown using the functions ''_exec_showset'', ''_exec_showget'', and ''_exec_showreset''.

===Return values===
The return value indicates the exit status of the spawned program. A value of zero indicates that the spawned program executed successfully. A positive value indicates that the spawned program executed, but was [[abnormal end|aborted]] or ended in error, the value returned is the exit status of the child process. A negative value indicates that the spawned program did not execute, and errno is set.
Under Microsoft Windows, ''spawn'' returns the negated error code returned from LoadModule for compatibility with the C run-time library. The following error codes may be encountered: 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Value||Notes
|-
|&lt;code&gt;-2 &lt;/code&gt;||File not found 
|-
|&lt;code&gt;-3 &lt;/code&gt;||Path not found 
|-
|&lt;code&gt;-11 &lt;/code&gt;||Invalid .exe file (for Windows) 
|-
|&lt;code&gt;-13 &lt;/code&gt;||DOS 4. 0 application 
|-
|&lt;code&gt;-14 &lt;/code&gt;||Unknown .exe type (may be DOS extended)
|-
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''select''' is a [[system call]] and [[application programming interface]] (API) in [[Unix-like]] and [[POSIX]]-compliant operating systems for examining the status of [[file descriptors]] of open input/output channels. The select system call is similar to the ''poll'' facility introduced in UNIX System V and later operating systems.

In the [[C programming language]] source code, the select system call is declared in the header file sys/select.h or [[unistd.h]], and has the following syntax:
&lt;pre&gt;
int select(int nfds, fd_set* readfds, fd_set* writefds, fd_set* errorfds, struct timeval* timeout);
&lt;/pre&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!argument    !! description
|-
|''nfds''    || the maximum file descriptor across all the sets, plus 1
|-
|''readfds'' || fd_set type holding the file descriptors to be checked for being ready to read, and on output indicates which file descriptors are ready to read. Can be NULL.
|-
|''writefds''|| fd_set type holding the file descriptors to be checked for being ready to write, and on output indicates which file descriptors are ready to write. Can be NULL.
|-
|''errorfds''|| fd_set type holding the file descriptors to be checked for error conditions pending, and on output indicates which file descriptors have error conditions pending. Can be NULL.
|-
|''timeout'' || structure of type struct timeval that specifies a maximum interval to wait for the selection to complete. If the timeout argument points to an object of type struct timeval whose members are 0, select() does not block. If the timeout argument is NULL, select() blocks until an event causes one of the masks to be returned with a valid (non-zero) value.
|}

&lt;code&gt;fd_set type&lt;/code&gt; arguments may be manipulated with four utility macros: FD_SET(), FD_CLR(), FD_ZERO(), and FD_ISSET().

Select returns the total number of bits set in ''readfds'', ''writefds'' and ''errorfds'', or zero if the timeout expired, and -1 on error.

The sets of file descriptor used in select are finite in size, depending on the operating system. The newer system call ''poll'' provides a more flexible solution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In most modern [[operating systems]], a program that needs to access data from a [[file]] stored in a [[filesystem]] uses the read system call. The file is identified by the [[file descriptor]] that is obtained from a previous call to [[Open (system call)|open]]. This system call reads data, in bytes as specified by the caller, from the file and stores then into a buffer supplied by the calling process.

The read system call can take three arguments:

# The file descriptor of the file,
# the buffer where the read data is to be stored and
# the number of bytes to be read from the file.

==POSIX usage==

The read system call interface is standardized by the POSIX specification. Data from a file is read by calling the read function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);&lt;/source&gt;

The value returned is the number of bytes read (zero indicates [[end of file]]) and the file position is advanced by this number. It is not an error if this number is smaller than the number of bytes requested; this may happen for example because fewer bytes are actually available right now (maybe because we were close to end-of-file, or because we are reading from a [[Pipe (Unix)|pipe]], or from a [[Computer terminal|terminal]]), or because the system call was interrupted by a [[Signal (computing)|signal]]. 

Alternatively. -1 is returned when an error occurs, in such a case errno is set appropriately and it is left unspecified whether the file position (if any) changes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">For most  [[file system]]s, a program initializes access to a [[Computer file|file]] in a [[filesystem]] using the '''open''' [[system call]]. This allocates resources associated to the file (the [[file descriptor]]), and returns a [[Smart pointer#Handles|handle]] that the process will use to refer to that file. In some cases the open is performed by the first access.

The same file may be opened simultaneously by several processes, and even by the same process (resulting in several file descriptors for the same file) depending on the file organization and filesystem. Operations on the descriptors like moving the file pointer, or closing it are independent (they do not affect other descriptors for the same file). Operations of the file (like a write) can be seen by operations on the other descriptors (a posterior read can read the written data).

During the open, the filessytem may allocate memory for buffers (or it may wait until the first operation). 

The absolute filename is resolved. This may include connecting to a remote host and notifying an operator that a removable media is required. It may include the initialization of a communication device. At this point an error may be returned if the host or media is not available. The first access to at least the directory within the filesystem is performed. An error will usually be returned if the higher level components of the path (directories) cannot be located or accessed. An error will be returned if the file is expected to exist and it does not or if the file should not already exist and it does. 

If the file is expected to exist and it does, the file access, as restricted by permission flags within the file meta data or access control list, are validated against the requested type of operations. This usually requires an additional filesystem access although in some filesystems meta flags may be part of the directory structure.

If the file is being created the filesystem may allocate the default initial amount of storage or a specified amount depending on the file system capabilities. If this fails an error will be returned. Updating the directory with the new entry may be performed or it maybe delayed until the [[close]] is performed

Various other errors which may occur during the open include directory update failures, un-permitted multiple connections, media failures, communication link failures and device failures.

The return value must always be examined and an error specific action taken.

In many cases programing language specific run-time library opens may perform additional actions including initializing a run-time library structure related to the file.

As soon as an file is no longer needed, the program should [[close]] it. This will cause run-time library and filesystem buffers to be updated to the physical media and permit other processes to access the data if exclusive use had been required. Some run-time libraries may [[close]] a file if the program calls the run-time exit. Some filesystems may perform the necessary operations if the program terminates. Neither of these is likely to take place in the event of a kernel or power failure. This can cause damaged filessytem structures requiring the running of privileged and lengthy filesystem utilities  during which the entire file system may be inaccessible.

==open call arguments==
#The [[pathname]] to the file,
#The kind of access requested on the file (read, write, append etc.),
#The initial file permission is requested using the third argument called &lt;tt&gt;mode&lt;/tt&gt;. This argument is relevant only when a new file is being created. 

After using the file, the process should close the file using [[close (system call)|close]] call, which takes the file descriptor of the file to be closed. Some filessytems include a disposition to permit releasing the file.

Some computer languages include run-time libraries which include additional functionality for particular filesystems. The open (or some auxiliary routine) may include specifications for key size, record size, connection speed. Some open routines include specification of the program code to be executed in the event of an error.

====perl language form====
 open FILEHANDLE,MODE[,EXPR]

for example:

   open(my $fh, &quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;output.txt&quot;) 

Perl also uses the &lt;code&gt;tie&lt;/code&gt; function of the &lt;code&gt;Tie::File&lt;/code&gt; module to associate an array with a 
file.&lt;ref name=perlTieArray&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://perldoc.perl.org/Tie/File.html |title=Tie::File |publisher=perldoc.perl.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &lt;code&gt;tie::AnyDBM_File&lt;/code&gt; function associates a hash with a file.&lt;ref name=perlTieHash&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://perldoc.perl.org/AnyDBM_File.html |title=AnyDBM_File |publisher=perldoc.perl.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====C library POSIX definition ====
The  [http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/open.html open] call is standardized by the [[POSIX]] specification

 int open (const char ''*path'', int ''oflag'', .../*,mode_t ''mode'' */);
 int openat ...
 int creat(const char ''*path'', mode_t mode) 
 FILE *fopen(const char *restrict filename, const char *restrict mode);

The value returned is a file descriptor which is a reference to a process specific  structure which contains, among other things, a position pointer that indicates which place in the file will be acted upon by the next operation.

Open may return a '''&lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt;'''  indicating a failure with &lt;code&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt; detailing the error. 

The file system also updates a global table of all open files which is used for determining if a file is currently in use by any process.

=====path=====
The name of the file to open. It includes the [[file path]] defining where, in which file system, the file is found (or should be created). 

&lt;code&gt;openat&lt;code&gt; expects a relative path.

=====oflag=====
This argument formed by [[Mask (computing)#Arguments to functions|OR'ing together]] optional parameters and  (from &lt;[[fcntl.h]]&gt;) one of:

:&lt;code&gt;O_RDONLY&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;O_RDWR&lt;/code&gt;

Option parameters include:

:&lt;code&gt;O_APPEND&lt;/code&gt; data written will be appended to the end of the file. The file operations will always adjust the position pointer to the end of the file.

:&lt;code&gt;O_CREAT&lt;/code&gt; Create the file if it does not exist; otherwise the open fails setting [[errno.h|errno]] to ENOENT.

:&lt;code&gt;O_EXCL&lt;/code&gt; Used with &lt;code&gt;O_CREAT&lt;/code&gt; if the file already exists, then fail, setting errno to EEXIST.

:&lt;code&gt;O_TRUNC&lt;/code&gt; If the file already exists  then discard its previous contents, reducing it to an empty file. Not applicable for a device or named pipe.

Additional flags and errors are defined in [http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/open.html open] call.
    
&lt;code&gt;creat() is implemented as:

  int creat(const char *path, mode_t mode)
    { return open(path, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, mode); }


[http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fopen.html fopen] uses string flags such as &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and returns a file pointer used with [http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fgets.html fgets], [http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fputs.html fputs] and [http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fclose.html fclose].

===== mode_t =====
Optional and relevant only when creating a new file, defines the
[[file permissions]]. These include  read, write or execute the file by the owner, group or all users. The mode is masked by the calling process's [[umask]]: bits set in the umask are cleared in the mode.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[computing]], when a [[Computer process|process]] '''forks''', it creates a copy of itself. More generally, a fork in a [[Thread (computer science)|multithreading]] environment means that a [[Thread (computer programming)|thread]] of execution is duplicated, creating a child thread from the parent thread.

Under [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s, the parent and the child processes can tell each other apart by examining the return value of the &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; [[system call]]. In the child process, the return value of &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; is 0, whereas the return value in the parent process is the [[Process identifier|PID]] of the newly created child process.

The fork operation creates a separate [[address space]] for the child. The child process has an exact copy of all the memory segments of the parent process, though if [[copy-on-write]] semantics are implemented actual physical memory may not be assigned (i.e., both processes may share the same physical memory segments for a while). Both the parent and child processes possess the same code segments, but execute independently of each other.

== Importance of forking in Unix ==

Forking is an important part of Unix, critical to the support of its design philosophy, which encourages the development of [[Filter (Unix)|filters]]. In Unix, a filter is a (usually small) program that reads its input from [[Standard streams|stdin]], and writes its output to [[Standard streams|stdout]]. A [[Pipeline (Unix)|pipeline]] of these commands can be strung together by a [[Unix shell|shell]] to create new commands. For example, one can string together the output of the &lt;code&gt;find(1)&lt;/code&gt; command and the input of the &lt;code&gt;wc(1)&lt;/code&gt; command to create a new command that will print a count of files ending in &quot;.cpp&quot; found in the current directory and any subdirectories, as follows: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ find . -name &quot;*.cpp&quot; -print | wc -l
&lt;/source&gt;
In order to accomplish this, the shell forks itself, and uses [[Pipeline (Unix)|pipes]], a form of [[interprocess communication]], to tie the output of the &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; command to the input of the &lt;code&gt;wc&lt;/code&gt; command. Two child processes are created, one for each command (&lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wc&lt;/code&gt;). These child processes are [[Overlay (operating system)|overlaid]] with the code associated with the programs they are intended to execute, using the &lt;code&gt;exec(3)&lt;/code&gt; family of system calls (in the above example, &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; will overlay the first child process, and &lt;code&gt;wc&lt;/code&gt; will overlay the second child process, and the shell will use pipes to tie the output of find with the input of wc). 

More generally, forking is also performed by the shell each time a user issues a command. A child process is created by forking the shell, and the child process is overlaid, once again by &lt;code&gt;exec&lt;/code&gt;, with the code associated with the program to be executed.

==Process Address Space==
Whenever an executable file is executed, it becomes a process. An executable file contains binary code grouped into a number of blocks called segments. Each segment is used for storing a particular type of data. A few segment names of a typical [[Executable and Linkable Format|ELF]] executable file are listed below.

* [[text segment|text]] — Segment containing executable code
* [[.bss]]              — Segment containing data initialized to zero
* [[data segment|data]] — Segment containing initialized data
* [[symtab]]            — Segment containing the program symbols (e.g., function name, variable names, etc.)
* interp            — Segment containing the name of the interpreter to be used

The &lt;code&gt;[[readelf]]&lt;/code&gt; command can provide further details of the ELF file. When such a file is loaded in the memory for execution, the segments  are loaded in memory. It is not necessary for the entire executable to be loaded in contiguous memory locations. Memory is divided into equal sized partitions called pages (typically 4KB). Hence when the executable is loaded in the memory, different parts of the executable are placed in different pages (which might not be contiguous). Consider an ELF executable file of size 10K. If the page size supported by the OS is 4K, then the file will be split into three pieces (also called [[Call stack|frames]]) of size 4K, 4K, and 2K respectively. These three frames will be accommodated in any three free pages in memory.

==Fork and page sharing==
When a &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; system call is issued, a copy of all the pages corresponding to the parent process is created, loaded into a separate memory location by the OS for the child process. But this is not needed in certain cases. Consider the case when a child executes an &quot;&lt;code&gt;[[Exec (operating system)|exec]]&lt;/code&gt;&quot; system call (which is used to execute any executable file from within a [[C (programming language)|C]] program) or exits very soon after the &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt;. When the child is needed just to execute a command for the parent process, there is no need for copying the parent process' pages, since exec replaces the address space of the process which invoked it with the command to be executed. 

In such cases, a technique called [[copy-on-write]] (COW) is used. With this technique, when a fork occurs, the parent process's pages are not copied for the child process. Instead, the pages are shared between the child and the parent process. Whenever a process (parent or child) modifies a page, a separate copy of that particular page alone is made for that process (parent or child) which performed the modification. This process will then use the newly copied page rather than the shared one in all future references. The other process (the one which did not modify the [[shared page]]) continues to use the original copy of the page (which is now no longer shared). This technique is called copy-on-write since the page is copied when some process writes to it.

==Vfork and page sharing==
&lt;code&gt;vfork&lt;/code&gt; is another UNIX system call used to create a new process. When a &lt;code&gt;vfork()&lt;/code&gt; system call is issued, the parent process will be suspended until the child process has either completed execution or been replaced with a new executable image via one of the &lt;code&gt;execve()&lt;/code&gt; family of system calls. Even in &lt;code&gt;vfork&lt;/code&gt;, the pages are shared among the parent and child process. But &lt;code&gt;vfork&lt;/code&gt; does not mandate copy-on-write. Hence if the child process makes a modification in any of the shared pages, no new page will be created and the modified pages are visible to the parent process too. Since there is absolutely no page copying involved (consuming additional memory), this technique is highly efficient when a process needs to execute a blocking command using the child process.

On some systems, &lt;code&gt;vfork()&lt;/code&gt; is the same as &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt;.

The &lt;code&gt;vfork()&lt;/code&gt; function differs from &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; only in that the child process can share code and data with the calling process (parent process). This speeds cloning activity significantly, at a risk to the integrity of the parent process if &lt;code&gt;vfork()&lt;/code&gt; is misused.

The use of &lt;code&gt;vfork()&lt;/code&gt; for any purpose except as a prelude to an immediate call to a function from the &lt;code&gt;exec&lt;/code&gt; family, or to &lt;code&gt;_exit()&lt;/code&gt;, is not advised. In particular the Linux man page for vfork strongly discourages its use: &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linuxmanpages.com/man2/vfork.2.php VFORK&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|It is rather unfortunate that Linux revived this specter from the past. The  BSD  man  page  states: &quot;This system call will be eliminated when proper system sharing mechanisms are  implemented. Users should not depend on the memory sharing semantics of vfork() as it will, in that case, be made synonymous to fork(2).&quot;}}

The &lt;code&gt;vfork()&lt;/code&gt; function can be used to create new processes without fully copying the address space of the old process. If a forked process is simply going to call &lt;code&gt;exec&lt;/code&gt;, the data space copied from the parent to the child by &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; is not used. This is particularly inefficient in a paged environment, making &lt;code&gt;vfork()&lt;/code&gt; particularly useful. Depending upon the size of the parent's data space, &lt;code&gt;vfork()&lt;/code&gt; can give a significant performance improvement over &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt;.

The &lt;code&gt;vfork()&lt;/code&gt; function can normally be used just like &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt;. It does not work, however, to return while running in the child's context from the caller of &lt;code&gt;vfork()&lt;/code&gt; since the eventual return from &lt;code&gt;vfork()&lt;/code&gt; would then return to a no longer existent stack frame. Care must also be taken to call &lt;code&gt;_exit()&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; if &lt;code&gt;exec&lt;/code&gt; cannot be called, since &lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; flushes and closes standard I/O channels, thereby damaging the parent process's standard I/O data structures. (Even with &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt;, it is still incorrect to call &lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt;, since buffered data would then be flushed twice.)

If signal handlers are invoked in the child process after &lt;code&gt;vfork()&lt;/code&gt;, they must follow the same rules as other code in the child process.&lt;ref&gt;UNIX Specification Version 2, 1997 [http://www.opengroup.org/pubs/online/7908799/xsh/vfork.html http://www.opengroup.org/pubs/online/7908799/xsh/vfork.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==MMUless systems==

On several embedded devices, there is no [[Memory Management Unit]], which is a requirement for implementing the copy-on-write semantics prescribed by &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt;. If the system has some other mechanism for per-process address spaces, such as a [[segment register]], copying the entire process memory to the new process achieves the desired effect, however this is a costly operation and most likely unneeded given that the new process almost immediately replaces the process image in most instances.

If all processes share a single address space, then the only way &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; could be implemented would be to swap the memory pages along with the rest of the task context switch. Rather than doing that, embedded operating systems such as [[uClinux]] usually omit &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; and only implement &lt;code&gt;vfork()&lt;/code&gt;; part of the work porting to such a platform involves rewriting code to use the latter.

==Forking in other operating systems==

The fork mechanism (1969) in Unix and Linux maintains implicit assumptions on the underlying hardware: linear memory and a [[paging]] mechanism that enable an efficient, memory copy operation of a contiguous address range. In the original design of the VMS (now [[OpenVMS]]) operating system (1977), a copy operation with subsequent mutation of the content of a few specific addresses for the new process as in forking was considered risky. Errors in the current process state may be copied to a child process. Here, the metaphor of process spawning is used: each component of the memory layout of the new process is newly constructed from scratch. From a software-engineering viewpoint this latter approach would be considered more clean and safe, but the fork mechanism is still predominant due to its efficiency. The [[spawn (computing)]] metaphor was later adopted in Microsoft operating systems (1993).

==Application usage==
The fork() [[system call]] takes no argument and returns a [[process ID]], which is usually an integer value.  The returned process ID is of the type '''pid_t''', which has been defined in the [[header file]], '''sys/types.h'''.

The purpose of fork() system call is to create a new process, which becomes the [[child process]] of caller, after which both, the parent and child processes, will execute the code following the fork() system call. Hence, it is important to distinguish between parent and child process. This can be done by testing the return value of fork() system call.

* If fork() returns a negative value, it indicates that the creation of the process was unsuccessful.
* fork() returns a zero to the newly created child process.
* fork() returns a positive value, the process ID of the child process, to the parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CSL Website|url=http://www.csl.mtu.edu/cs4411/www/NOTES/process/fork/create.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''exec''' collection of functions of Unix-like [[operating systems]] cause the running process to be completely replaced by the program passed as an argument to the function. As a new process is not created, the [[process identifier]] (PID) does not change, but the data, heap and stack of the original process are replaced by those of the new process.

In the ''execl'', ''execlp'', ''execv'', and ''execvp'' calls, the new process image inherits the current [[environment variable]]s.

Files open when an ''exec'' call is made remain open in the new process. This aspect is used to specify the [[standard streams]] (stdin, stdout and stderr) of the new process.

In [[MS-DOS]] environments, a program executed with one of the ''exec'' functions is always loaded into memory as if the &quot;maximum allocation&quot; in the program's executable file header is set to default value 0xFFFF. The EXEHDR utility can be used to change the maximum allocation field of a program. However, if this is done and the program is invoked with one of the ''exec'' functions, the program might behave differently from a program invoked directly from the operating-system command line or with one of the ''spawn'' functions.

Many [[Unix shell]]s also offer an ''exec'' [[shell builtin|built-in command]] that replaces the shell process with the specified program.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#IDX74 - ''exec'' built-in command in bash manual&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Wrapper function|Wrapper]] scripts often use this command to run a program (either directly or through an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] or [[virtual machine]]) after setting environment variables or other configuration. By using ''exec'', the resources used by the shell program do not need to stay in use after the program is started. &lt;ref&gt;http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/wrapper.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prototypes==

The functions are declared in the ''[[unistd.h]]'' header for the [[POSIX]] standard and in ''[[process.h]]'' for DOS, OS/2, and Windows.

:&lt;code&gt;int execl(char const *path, char const *arg0, ...);&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;int execle(char const *path, char const *arg0, ..., char const * const *envp);&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;int execlp(char const *file, char const *arg0, ...);&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;int execv(char const *path, char const * const * argv);&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;int execve(char const *path, char const * const *argv, char const * const *envp);&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;int execvp(char const *file, char const * const *argv);&lt;/code&gt;

Some implementations provide these functions named with a leading underscore (e.g. _execl).

===Function names===
The base of each function is '''exec''', followed by one or more letters:
:'''e''' - An array of pointers to [[environment variable]]s is explicitly passed to the new process image. 
:'''l''' - [[Command-line argument]]s are passed individually to the function. 
:'''p''' - Uses the [[PATH (variable)|PATH environment variable]] to find the file named in the ''path'' argument to be executed. 
:'''v''' - Command-line arguments are passed to the function as an array of pointers.

===path===
The ''path'' argument specifies the path name of the file to execute as the new process image. Arguments beginning at ''arg0'' are pointers to arguments to be passed to the new process image. The ''argv'' value is an array of pointers to arguments.

===arg0===
The first argument ''arg0'' should be the name of the executable file.  Usually it is the same value as the ''path'' argument.  Some programs may incorrectly rely on this argument providing the location of the executable, but there is no guarantee of this nor is it standardized across platforms.

===envp===
Argument ''envp'' is an array of pointers to environment settings. 
The ''exec'' calls named ending with an ''e'' alter the environment for the new process image by passing a list of environment settings through the ''envp'' argument. This argument is an array of character pointers; each element (except for the final element) points to a null-terminated string defining an environment variable.

Each null-terminated string has the form:
:&lt;code&gt;name=value&lt;/code&gt;

where ''name'' is the environment variable name, and ''value'' is the value of that that variable. The final element of the ''envp'' array must be [[null pointer|null]]. If ''envp'' itself is null, the new process inherits the current environment settings.

==Return value==
Normally the ''exec'' function will replace the current process, so it cannot return anything to the original process. Processes do have an [[exit status]], but that value is collected by the [[parent process]].

If an exec function does return to the calling process, an error occurred, the return value is −1, and [[errno]] is set to one of the following values:

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''process.h''' is a C header file which contains function declarations and macros used in working with threads and processes. Most C compilers that target DOS, Windows 3.1x, Win32, OS/2, Novell NetWare or DOS extenders supply this header and the library functions in their C library. Neither the header file nor the functions are defined by either the ANSI C|ANSI/ISO C standard or by POSIX.

==History==
Microsoft’s version of the file dates back to at least 1985, according to its copyright statement.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Copyright 1985–1989, Microsoft Corporation&quot;, in QuickC version 2.00 process.h file&lt;/ref&gt; An early reference to the file was in a post on the net.micro.pc usenet on Oct-26-1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;msft process.h&quot;&gt;[http://groups-beta.google.com/group/net.micro.pc/browse_frm/thread/b85ef1946a4915e6/1154bb52be4d5854?lnk=st&amp;q=%22process%5C.h%22&amp;rnum=23#1154bb52be4d5854 Is my floppy diskette formated?], groups-beta.google.com&lt;/ref&gt; The compiler used was Microsoft C compiler version 3.0.
The Lattice C compiler version 3.30 (Aug-24-1988) did not have such a header file, but offered similar functions.
As of Borland, they provided it in their Turbo C compiler version 2.01.
The C Ware-Personal C compiler version 1.2c (June 1989) had only the ANSI headers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">For most file systems, a program terminates access to a file in a [[filesystem]] using the close system call. This [[flushes]] buffers, updates file metadata (which may include and end of file indicator in the data), de-allocates resources associated with the file (including the [[file descriptor]]) and updates the system wide table of files in use. Some languages maintain a structure of files opened by its run-time library and may close when the program terminates. Some operating systems will invoke the close if the program terminates. Some operating systems will invoke the close as  part of an operating system recovery as a result of a system failure.
 
====C library POSIX definition ====
The  [http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/close.html close] call is standardized by the [[POSIX]] specification

 int close (int filedes);
 int fclose(FILE *stream);


The function returns zero to indicate the file was closed successfully. If any error occurs, a value of -1 is returned and errno is appropriately set.

The errors that can occur include:
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''EBADF'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;The argument supplied was not a valid file descriptor&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''EINTR'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;The function call was interrupted by a [[Signal (computing)|signal]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''EIO'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;An I/O error occurred&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''conio.h''' is a C (programming language)|C header file used in old MS-DOS compilers to create text user interfaces. It is not described in The C Programming Language (book)|''The C Programming Language'' book, and it is not part of the C standard library, ISO C nor is it required by POSIX.

This header declares several useful library functions for performing &quot;console input and output&quot; from a program. Most C compilers that target DOS, Windows 3.x, Phar Lap (company)|Phar Lap, DOSX, OS/2, or Win32&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7x2hy4cx(VS.71).aspx |title=Console and Port I/O in MSDN}}&lt;/ref&gt; have this header and supply the associated library functions in the default C library. Most C compilers that target UNIX and Linux do not have this header and do not supply the library functions. Some embedded systems are using a conio-compatible library &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microvga.com/conio-lib |title=MicroVGA conio Text User Interface Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The library functions declared by &lt;tt&gt;conio.h&lt;/tt&gt; vary somewhat from compiler to compiler. As originally implemented in Lattice C, the various functions mapped directly to the first few DOS int 21h functions. But the library supplied with Borland's Turbo C did not use the DOS API but instead accessed video RAM directly for output and used BIOS interrupt calls; they also have additional functions inspired on the successful Turbo Pascal library.

Compilers that targeted non-DOS operating systems, such as Linux{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}&lt;!-- contradicts the sentence above--&gt;, Win32 and OS/2, provided different implementations of these functions.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The version done by DJ Delorie for the DJGPP|GO32 extender is particularly extensive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/libc/libc_4.html|title=DJGPP C Library Reference - conio}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Another example is SyncTERM#Libraries | SyncTERM's ciolib.

&quot;alloc.h&quot; is a non-standard [[w:header file | header file]]. It is not part of the [[w:ANSI | ANSI]] standard, and thus is not an ANSI [[C Programming | C]] header file, but it exists in many C language dialects. It is available with [[w:Borland Turbo C | Borland Turbo C]] and [[w:TIGCC | TIGCC]]. This header file provides operations regarding [[w:Dynamic Memory Allocation | Dynamic Memory Allocation]]. This header file includes &quot;[[w:memory management | memory management]]&quot; functions. 

== Example usage ==
To use the functions in &lt;code&gt; alloc.h &lt;/code&gt;, we must include &lt;code&gt; alloc.h &lt;/code&gt; before we use them.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;alloc.h&gt;

int main()
{
     int *ptr;
     
     ptr = (int *) alloca (sizeof(int));
     scanf(&quot;%d&quot;, ptr);
     printf(&quot;%d is stored dynamically.\n&quot;, *ptr);

     return 0;
}

&lt;/source&gt;
     
== Functions ==

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Function Declaration !! Function Purpose 
|-
| &lt;code&gt;void *alloca (unsigned long Size);&lt;/code&gt; || Allocates storage on [[w:Stack (data structure) | stack]] memory.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;void *calloc (unsigned short NoOfItems, unsigned short SizeOfItems);&lt;/code&gt;|| Allocates memory storage for given number of elements, from the memory heap. The value at the space set for the variables is automatically initialized to zero.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;void *calloc_throw (unsigned short NoOfItems, unsigned short SizeOfItems);&lt;/code&gt;|| Calls &lt;code&gt;[[w:calloc | calloc]]&lt;/code&gt; and throws an error if memory is not available. Otherwise it returns address returned by &lt;code&gt;calloc&lt;/code&gt;.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;void *malloc (unsigned long Size);&lt;/code&gt; || It allocates &quot;Size&quot; bytes memory in memory heap. It returns [[w:NULL | NULL]] on failure. This memory block can be deallocated by means of &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; function.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;void *malloc_throw (unsigned long Size);&lt;/code&gt;|| Calls &lt;code&gt;[[w:malloc | malloc]]&lt;/code&gt; and throws an error if memory is not available. Otherwise it returns address returned by &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt;.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;void *realloc (void *Ptr, unsigned long NewSize);&lt;/code&gt; || Reallocates the memory block, previously allocated by &lt;code&gt;*Ptr&lt;/code&gt;. It returns the address of newly reallocated memory block which may be different from &lt;code&gt;Ptr&lt;/code&gt;. It returns NULL on failure.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;void *realloc_throw (void *Ptr, unsigned long NewSize);&lt;/code&gt; || Calls &lt;code&gt;[[w:realloc | realloc]]&lt;/code&gt; and throws an error if memory is not available. Otherwise it returns address returned by &lt;code&gt;realloc&lt;/code&gt;.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;void free (void *Ptr);&lt;/code&gt;|| Deallocates memory allocated by &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;calloc&lt;/code&gt; directly to the console.

=== ''' Heap Memory Allocation Functions ''' ===

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Function Declaration !! Function Purpose 
|-
| &lt;code&gt;HANDLE HeapAlloc (unsigned long Size);&lt;/code&gt; || It allocates Size bytes of heap of memory and returns handle. Size is taken as even. Odd sizes are rounded up. Allocated memory is kept in [[w:Singly linked list | Singly linked list]] structure. Maximum size is 65520 bytes and minimum size is 6 bytes. It returns H_NULL on failure.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;HANDLE HeapAllocThrow (unsigned long Size);&lt;/code&gt; || It calls &lt;code&gt;HeapAlloc&lt;/code&gt; function and returns the corresponding handle. It throws an error on failure.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;HANDLE HeapAllocESTACK (unsigned long Size);&lt;/code&gt; || If &quot;Size&quot; bytes memory is not available, it truncates expression stack. Even after reducing stack memory is not available it returns H_NULL.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;HANDLE HeapAllocHigh (unsigned long Size);&lt;/code&gt; || It allocates the memory at the high end of memory heap and returns Handle. It moves all used blocks of memory down to heap. If memory is not available it returns H_NULL.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;HANDLE HeapAllocHighThrow (unsigned long Size);&lt;/code&gt; || It calls &lt;code&gt;HeapAllocHigh&lt;/code&gt; function and returns the handle. On failure it throws a memory error.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;void *HeapDeref (HANDLE Handle);&lt;/code&gt; || It dereferences the handle and returns the memory address. To use the memory reserved by a handle, the handle must be dereferenced. 
|-
| &lt;code&gt;void HeapFree (HANDLE Handle);&lt;/code&gt; || It deallocates the memory allocated by the handle.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;void HeapFreeIndir (HANDLE *HandlePtr);&lt;/code&gt; || It deallocates the block of memory associated with passed Handle and sets the Handle to NULL.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;void *HeapAllocPtr (unsigned long Size);&lt;/code&gt; || It is very similar to &lt;code&gt;HeapAllocHigh&lt;/code&gt;. It does the same job. But instead of returning a handle it returns pointer to an allocated block. It returns NULL on failure.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;void *HeapAllocPtrThrow (unsigned long Size);&lt;/code&gt; || It calls &lt;code&gt;HeapAllocPtr&lt;/code&gt; and returns the corresponding pointer. It throws an error on failure.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;void HeapFreePtr (void *Ptr);&lt;/code&gt; || It deallocates the memory block allocated by &lt;code&gt;HeapAllocPtr&lt;/code&gt;.
|}

=== ''' Miscellaneous Functions ''' ===

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Function Declaration !! Function Purpose 
|-
| &lt;code&gt;unsigned long HeapAvail (void);&lt;/code&gt; || It returns the total number of available bytes in memory heap.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;void HeapCompress (void);&lt;/code&gt; || It compresses all allocated heap memory blocks. If possible, it deletes free memory blocks. This function is generally called internally whenever necessary.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;void *HeapEnd (void);&lt;/code&gt; || It returns the pointer to the end of memory heap.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;HANDLE HeapLock (HANDLE Handle);&lt;/code&gt; || It locks the memory block allocated by the handle. It returns same handle on success otherwise &lt;code&gt;H_NULL&lt;/code&gt;. Locking ensures the memory block is not moved or deleted during memory heap rearrangement.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;short HeapGetLock (HANDLE Handle);&lt;/code&gt; || It determines whether the passed handle is locked. It returns 0 if block is not locked.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;void *HLock (HANDLE Handle);&lt;/code&gt; || It locks as well as dereferences memory block reserved by the Handle.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;unsigned long HeapMax (void);&lt;/code&gt; || It returns the maximum size of memory block that can be reserved.

== Predefined types ==

* '''Bool'''

 {{C-lang | enum Bool {FALSE, TRUE};}}

It is an [[w:enumeration | enumeration]]. It has defined two binary values [[w:false | false]] and [[w:true | true]]. Constant &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt; stands for [[w:logic 0 | logic 0]] while constant &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; stands for [[w:logic 1 | logic 1]].

* '''HANDLE'''

  {{C-lang | typedef unsigned short HANDLE;}}

A handle represents an allocated, aligned block of memory. Its address can be retrieved by means of &lt;code&gt;HeapDeref&lt;/code&gt; function in &lt;code&gt;alloc.h&lt;/code&gt;.
HANDLE is used for managing the memory allocated by the functions of &lt;code&gt;alloc.h&lt;/code&gt;. Some functions from other header files use HANDLE as parameter.

== Deviation from standards ==
[[File:Malloc_versus_HeapAlloc.svg|280px|thumb| This image shows the major difference between malloc and HeapAlloc]]
*The alloca function is different from the  standard &lt;code&gt; [[w:malloc | malloc]] &lt;/code&gt; function, in that malloc allocates memory in memory heap whereas &lt;code&gt; alloca &lt;/code&gt; allocates it in stack memory. Hence, this storage is local. Within a function, if memory is allocated using &lt;code&gt; alloca &lt;/code&gt;, it is deallocated automatically at the end of function. &lt;code&gt; alloca &lt;/code&gt; is more preferred in applications which require local [[w:Dynamic Memory Allocation | Dynamic Memory Allocation]].&lt;br&gt;

*&lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; allocates given byte-block in linear order. It requires continuous block of memory. &lt;code&gt;HeapAlloc&lt;/code&gt; allocates memory which is stored in linked list structure. It is advantageous.

*Many a times, memory blocks are reserved. The memory blocks which are locked for a long time should be moved high in the heap. This reduces interference of such blocks with rest of the system. This can be achieved by using &lt;code&gt;HeapAllocHigh&lt;/code&gt; function. This rearranges the heap before requested memory allocation.

*When we call &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt;, memory manager assigns a pointer known as [[w:Handle (computing) | handle]] to allocated block. For each block Handles are assigned. So, when we want to use a large number of small size memory blocks, &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; is not quite efficient. Due to large number of Handles, handling becomes difficult. So, &lt;code&gt;alloca&lt;/code&gt; is better option in such cases.&lt;br&gt;

*&lt;code&gt;HeapRealloc&lt;/code&gt; function from &quot;alloc.h&quot; does the job similar to [[w:realloc | realloc]]. In case of, &lt;code&gt;HeapRealloc&lt;/code&gt; if reallocation fails, it deallocates previously allocated memory. Usually, realloc keeps previously allocated memory block intact.

&lt;tt&gt;'''strstr'''&lt;/tt&gt; is a [[C standard library]] string function as defined in &lt;tt&gt;[[string.h]]&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;tt&gt;'''strstr()'''&lt;/tt&gt; has the function signature &lt;tt&gt;char * strstr(const char *haystack, const char *needle);&lt;/tt&gt; which returns a [[Pointer (computing)|pointer]] to a character at the first index where &lt;tt&gt;needle&lt;/tt&gt; is in &lt;tt&gt;haystack&lt;/tt&gt;, or [[Null pointer|NULL]] if not present.&lt;ref name=&quot;die.net&quot;&gt;[http://linux.die.net/man/3/strcasestr strcasestr(3)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;'''strcasestr()'''&lt;/tt&gt; is a function much like &lt;tt&gt;strstr()&lt;/tt&gt; except that it ignores the case of both &lt;tt&gt;needle&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;haystack&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;tt&gt;strcasestr()&lt;/tt&gt; is a non-standard function while &lt;tt&gt;strstr()&lt;/tt&gt; conforms to [[ANSI C#C89|C89]] and [[C99]].&lt;ref name=&quot;die.net&quot;/&gt;

== Example ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main(void) 
{
        /* Define a pointer of type char, a string and the substring to be found*/
	char *cptr;
        char str[] = &quot;Wikipedia, be bold&quot;;
        char substr[] = &quot;edia, b&quot;;

        /* Find memory address where substr &quot;edia, b&quot; is found in str */
        cptr = strstr(str, substr);
	
        /* Print out the character at this memory address, i.e. 'e' */
	printf(&quot;%c\n&quot;, *cptr);

        /* Print out &quot;edia, be bold&quot; */
        printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, cptr);
	
	return 0;
}&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;cptr&lt;/tt&gt; is now a pointer to the sixth letter (&lt;tt&gt;e&lt;/tt&gt;) in &quot;wikipedia&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[C (programming language)|C language]] function included in [[C standard library]] (stdlib), which sets given bytes in memory.

==Synopsis==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
void *memset(void *s, int c, size_t n);
&lt;/source&gt;

The ''memset()'' copies ''c'' into each of the ''n'' first bytes of the object pointed to by ''s''.

==Return value==
The function returns the pointer ''s''. There is no defined value to return when an error occurs.

      <comment>moved [[Transwiki:Strncmp]] to [[C Programming/C Reference/string.h/strncmp]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''strncmp()''' is a standard-library function that compares two strings up to a specified length. The function is declared in [[string.h]], and is compatible with the following prototype:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;int strncmp (const char * s1, const char * s2, size_t num);&lt;/source&gt;

The function compares the strings using a [[lexicographical ordering]], but never examines more than &lt;code&gt;num&lt;/code&gt; characters. It returns zero if the strings are equal, or if their first &lt;code&gt;num&lt;/code&gt; characters are equal; otherwise, it returns a negative integer if &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt; is less than &lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt;, and a positive integer if &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt; is greater than &lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt;. A simple implementation might be as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int strncmp (const char * const s1, const char * const s2, const size_t num)
{
    const unsigned char * const us1 = (const unsigned char *) s1;
    const unsigned char * const us2 = (const unsigned char *) s2;

    for(size_t i = (size_t)0; i &lt; num; ++i)
    {
        if(us1[i] &lt; us2[i])
           return -1;
        else if(us1[i] &gt; us2[i])
           return 1;
        else if(! us1[i]) /* null byte -- end of string */
           return 0;
    }

    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In practice, however, real implementations are significantly optimized.

{{merge to|C mathematical operations|discuss=Talk:math.h#Single page for C mathematical functions|date=October 2011}}
{{Lowercase|title=div (C)}}
'''div''' is a function in [[C programming language]] that takes two integers as parameters and returns the result of a division between them. It is specified in ANSI-C, and is included from the [[stdlib.h]] header when used. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf chapter 7.20.6.2&lt;/ref&gt;

div always rounds towards 0, unlike ordinary integer division in C, where rounding for negative numbers is implementation-dependent.

&lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; has a prototype as follows:
:&lt;code&gt;div_t div (int numerator, int denominator)&lt;/code&gt;

The return value, &lt;code&gt;div_t&lt;/code&gt; is a special [[datatype]] which is specifically used in storing the results of this function. It is defined as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
typedef struct {
  int quot;
  int rem;
} div_t;
&lt;/source&gt;
Where &lt;code&gt;quot&lt;/code&gt; stores the quotient and &lt;code&gt;rem&lt;/code&gt; stores the remainder.

'''ldiv''' and '''lldiv''' are similar functions that divide integers of type &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;long long&lt;/code&gt;, respectively; and return a structure of type &lt;code&gt;ldiv_t&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;lldiv_t&lt;/code&gt;, respectively.
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
ldiv_t ldiv (long numerator, long denominator );
lldiv_t lldiv (long long numerator, long long denominator);
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''itoa''' ('''i'''nteger '''to''' '''A'''SCII) function is a widespread non-standard extension to the standard C programming language. It cannot be portably used, as it is not defined in any of the C language standards; however, compilers often provide it through the header &lt;code&gt;&lt;stdlib.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt; while in non-conforming mode, because it is a logical counterpart to the standard library function &lt;code&gt;atoi&lt;/code&gt;.

:&lt;code&gt;void itoa(int input, char *buffer, int radix)&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;itoa&lt;/code&gt; takes the integer input value &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; and converts it to a number in base &lt;code&gt;radix&lt;/code&gt;. The resulting number (a sequence of base-&lt;code&gt;radix&lt;/code&gt; digits) is written to the output buffer  &lt;code&gt;buffer&lt;/code&gt;. 

Depending on the implementation, &lt;code&gt;itoa&lt;/code&gt; may return a pointer to the first character in &lt;code&gt;buffer&lt;/code&gt;, or may be designed so that passing a null &lt;code&gt;buffer&lt;/code&gt; causes the function to return the length of the string that ''would have'' been written into a valid &lt;code&gt;buffer&lt;/code&gt;.

For converting a number to a string in base&amp;nbsp;8 (octal), 10 (decimal), or 16 (hexadecimal), a Standard-compliant alternative is to use the standard library function &lt;code&gt;sprintf&lt;/code&gt;.

==K&amp;R implementation==
The function &lt;code&gt;itoa&lt;/code&gt; appeared in the first edition of Kernighan and Ritchie's ''The C Programming Language'', on page 60. The second edition of ''The C Programming Language'' (&quot;K&amp;R2&quot;) contains the following implementation of &lt;code&gt;itoa&lt;/code&gt;, on page 64. The book notes several issues with this implementation, including the fact that it does not correctly handle the most negative number&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;2&lt;sup&gt;wordsize-1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;For the solution to this exercise, see [http://clc-wiki.net/wiki/K%26R2_solutions:Chapter_3:Exercise_4 &quot;K&amp;R2 solutions&quot;] on ''clc-wiki.net''.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 /* itoa:  convert n to characters in s */
 void itoa(int n, char s[])
 {
     int i, sign;
 
     if ((sign = n) &lt; 0)  /* record sign */
         n = -n;          /* make n positive */
     i = 0;
     do {       /* generate digits in reverse order */
         s[i++] = n % 10 + '0';   /* get next digit */
     } while ((n /= 10) &gt; 0);     /* delete it */
     if (sign &lt; 0)
         s[i++] = '-';
     s[i] = '\0';
     reverse(s);
 } 
&lt;/source&gt;

The function &lt;code&gt;reverse&lt;/code&gt; used above is implemented two pages earlier:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 #include &lt;string.h&gt;
 
 /* reverse:  reverse string s in place */
 void reverse(char s[])
 {
     int i, j;
     char c;
 
     for (i = 0, j = strlen(s)-1; i&lt;j; i++, j--) {
         c = s[i];
         s[i] = s[j];
         s[j] = c;
     }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==Other appearances==
An &lt;code&gt;itoa&lt;/code&gt; function (and a similar function, &lt;code&gt;ftoa&lt;/code&gt;, that converted a float to a string) was listed in the first-edition Unix manual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/1stEdman.html &quot;Unix Programmer's Manual&quot;], November 3, 1971. Section [http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/pdfs/man31.pdf &quot;Library routines&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the versions given above, the Unix library version had an interface roughly equivalent to

:&lt;code&gt;void itoa(int input, void (*subr)(char))&lt;/code&gt;

and would invoke the callback routine &lt;code&gt;subr&lt;/code&gt; on each character in the output string, thus eliminating the need for a buffer big enough to hold the entire string.

'''scanf''' is a [[Function (computer science)|function]] that reads data with specified format from a given string stream source, originated from [[C programming language]], and is present in many other programming languages.

The &lt;code&gt;scanf&lt;/code&gt; function prototype is:&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;int scanf(const char *format, ...);&lt;/source&gt;

The function returns the total number of items successfully matched, which can be less than the number requested. If the input stream is exhausted or reading from it otherwise fails before any items are matched, EOF is returned.

So far as is traceable, &quot;scanf&quot; stands for &quot;scan format&quot;, because it scans the input for valid tokens and parses them according to a specified format.

==Usage==
The &lt;code&gt;scanf&lt;/code&gt; function is found in [[C programming language|C]], in which it reads input for numbers and other [[datatype]]s from [[standard input]] (often a [[command line interface]] or similar kind of a [[text user interface]]).

The following shows code in C that reads a variable number of unformatted decimal [[integer]]s from the standard input  and prints out each of them on a separate line:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int
main(void)
{
    int n;
    while (scanf(&quot;%d&quot;, &amp; n))
        printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, n);
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

After being processed by the program above, a messy list of integers such as

 456 123 789     456 12
 456 1
       2378

will appear neatly as:
 456
 123
 789
 456
 12
 456
 1
 2378

To print out a word:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int
main(void)
{
    char word[20];
    if(scanf(&quot;%19s&quot;, word) == 1)
        puts(word);
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

No matter what the datatype the programmer wants the program to read, the arguments (such as &lt;code&gt;&amp;n&lt;/code&gt; above) must be [[Pointer (computing)|pointer]]s pointing to memory. Otherwise, the function will not perform correctly because it will be attempting to overwrite the wrong sections of memory, rather than pointing to the memory location of the variable you are attempting to get input for.

As &lt;code&gt;scanf&lt;/code&gt; is designated to read only from standard input, many programming languages with [[Interface (computer science)|interface]]s, such as [[PHP]], have derivatives such as &lt;code&gt;sscanf&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fscanf&lt;/code&gt; but not &lt;code&gt;scanf&lt;/code&gt; itself.

==Derivatives==
Depending on the actual source of input, programmers can use different derivatives of &lt;code&gt;scanf&lt;/code&gt;. Two common examples are &lt;code&gt;sscanf&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fscanf&lt;/code&gt;.

===fscanf===
The '''fscanf''' derivative reads input from a specified file stream. The prototypes are as follows:

([[C programming language|C]] or [[C++]])&lt;br&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;int fscanf (FILE *file, const char *format, ...); &lt;/source&gt;

([[PHP]])&lt;br&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;mixed fscanf (resource file, const string format [, mixed args...])&lt;/source&gt;&lt;!--

Add code examples --&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;fscanf&lt;/code&gt; derivative works like the original &lt;code&gt;scanf&lt;/code&gt; function - parts of the input, once read, will not be read again until the file is closed and reopened.

===sscanf===
The '''sscanf''' derivative reads input from a character string passed as the first argument. One important different from '''fscanf''' is that the string is read from the beginning every time the function is called. There is no 'pointer' that is incremented upon a successful read operation. The prototypes are as follows:

([[C programming language|C]] or [[C++]])&lt;br&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;int sscanf (const char *str, const char *format, ...); &lt;/source&gt;

([[PHP]])&lt;br&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;mixed sscanf (const string str, const string format [, mixed args...])&lt;/source&gt;&lt;!--

Add code examples --&gt;

===vscanf, vsscanf, and vfscanf===

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int vscanf (const char *format, va_list args);
int vsscanf (const char *source, const char *format, va_list args);
int vfscanf (FILE *file, const char *format, va_list args);
&lt;/source&gt;

These are like the same functions without the &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; prefix, except they take their arguments from a &lt;code&gt;va_list&lt;/code&gt;. (See [[stdarg.h]].) These variants may be used in variable-argument functions.&lt;!--

Add code examples --&gt;

==Format string specifications==
The formatting [[placeholder]]s in &lt;code&gt;scanf&lt;/code&gt; are more or less the same as that in [[printf|&lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;]], its reverse function.

There are rarely constants (i.e. characters that are not formatting [[placeholder]]s) in a format string, mainly because a program is usually not designed to read known data. The exception is one or more [[Whitespace (computer science)|whitespace]] characters, which discards all whitespace characters in the input.

Some of the most commonly used placeholders follow:
* &lt;code&gt;%d&lt;/code&gt; : Scan an integer as a signed [[decimal]] number.
* &lt;code&gt;%i&lt;/code&gt; : Scan an integer as a signed number.  Similar to &lt;code&gt;%d&lt;/code&gt;, but interprets the number as [[hexadecimal]] when preceded by &lt;code&gt;0x&lt;/code&gt; and [[octal]] when preceded by &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;.  For example, the string &lt;code&gt;031&lt;/code&gt; would be read as 31 using &lt;code&gt;%d&lt;/code&gt;, and 25 using &lt;code&gt;%i&lt;/code&gt;. The flag &lt;code&gt;h&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;%hi&lt;/code&gt; indicates conversion to a &lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hh&lt;/code&gt; conversion to a &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;.  
* &lt;code&gt;%u&lt;/code&gt; : Scan for decimal &lt;code&gt;unsigned int&lt;/code&gt; (Note that in the C99 standard the input value minus sign is optional, so if a negative{{Clarify|date=January 2011}} number is read, no errors will arise and the result will be the [[two's complement]]. See &lt;code&gt;[[strtoul]]()&lt;/code&gt;.{{Failed verification|date=January 2011}}) Correspondingly, &lt;code&gt;%hu&lt;/code&gt; scans for an &lt;code&gt;unsigned short&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;%hhu&lt;/code&gt; for an &lt;code&gt;unsigned char&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;%f&lt;/code&gt; : Scan a [[floating-point]] number in normal ([[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]]) notation.
* &lt;code&gt;%g&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%G&lt;/code&gt; : Scan a floating-point number in either normal or exponential notation. &lt;code&gt;%g&lt;/code&gt; uses lower-case letters and &lt;code&gt;%G&lt;/code&gt; uses upper-case.
* &lt;code&gt;%x&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%X&lt;/code&gt; : Scan an integer as an unsigned [[hexadecimal]] number.
* &lt;code&gt;%o&lt;/code&gt; : Scan an integer as an [[octal]] number.
* &lt;code&gt;%s&lt;/code&gt; : Scan a [[character string]]. The scan terminates at [[whitespace (computer science)|whitespace]].  A [[null character]] is stored at the end of the string, which means that the buffer supplied must be at least one character longer than the specified input length.
* &lt;code&gt;%c&lt;/code&gt; : Scan a character (char). No [[null character]] is added.
* &lt;code&gt;(space)&lt;/code&gt;: Space scans for [[whitespace (computer science)|whitespace]] characters.
* &lt;code&gt;%lf&lt;/code&gt; : Scan as a [[Double precision floating-point format|double]] floating-point number.
* &lt;code&gt;%Lf&lt;/code&gt; : Scan as a [[long double]] floating-point number.

The above can be used in compound with numeric modifiers and the &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;L&lt;/code&gt; modifiers which stand for &quot;long&quot; in between the percent symbol and the letter. There can also be numeric values between the percent symbol and the letters, preceding the &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; modifiers if any, that specifies the number of characters to be scanned. An optional [[asterisk]] (&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;) right after the percent symbol denotes that the datum read by this format specifier is not to be stored in a variable. No argument behind the format string should be included for this dropped variable.

The &lt;code&gt;ff&lt;/code&gt; modifier in printf is not present in scanf, causing differences between modes of input and output. The &lt;code&gt;ll&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hh&lt;/code&gt; modifiers are not present in the C90 standard, but are present in the C99 standard.&lt;ref&gt;C99 standard, §7.19.6.2 &quot;The fscanf function&quot; alinea 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a format string is
:&lt;code&gt;&quot;%7d%s %c%lf&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
The above format string scans the first seven characters as a decimal integer, then reads the remaining as a string until a space, new line or tab is found, then scans the first non-whitespace character following and a double-precision floating-point number afterwards.

==Error handling==
&lt;code&gt;scanf&lt;/code&gt; is usually used in situations when the program cannot guarantee that the input is in the expected format. Therefore a robust program must check whether the &lt;code&gt;scanf&lt;/code&gt; call succeeded and take appropriate action. If the input was not in the correct format, the erroneous data will still be on the input stream and must be read and discarded before new input can be read. An alternative method of reading input, which avoids this, is to use &lt;code&gt;[[fgets]]&lt;/code&gt; and then examine the string read in. The last step can be done by &lt;code&gt;[[sscanf]]&lt;/code&gt;, for example.

==Security==
Like &lt;code&gt;[[printf]]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;scanf&lt;/code&gt; is vulnerable to [[format string attack]]s. Great care should be taken to ensure that the formatting string includes limitations for string and array sizes. In most cases the input string size from a user is arbitrary; it can not be determined before the &lt;code&gt;scanf&lt;/code&gt; function is executed. This means that uses of &lt;code&gt;%s&lt;/code&gt; placeholders without length specifiers are inherently insecure and exploitable for buffer overflows. Another potential problem is to allow dynamic formatting strings, for example formatting strings stored in configuration files or other user controlled files. In this case the allowed input length of string sizes can not be specified unless the formatting string is checked beforehand and limitations are enforced. Related to this are additional or mismatched formatting placeholders which do not match the actual [[Varargs.h|vararg]] list. These placeholders might be partially extracted from the stack, contain undesirable or even insecure pointers depending on the particular implementation of [[Varargs.h|vararg]]s.

/*Another use that works only on some special compilers is:

scanf(&quot;Please enter a value %d&quot;,&amp;n);

Which prints the string in quotes and stops to accept input at the indicated %signs.*/

  void clearerr( FILE *stream );

The clearerr function resets the error flags and EOF indicator for the given stream. When an error occurs, you can use perror() to figure out which error actually occurred.

Puts() is a function used to display strings on screen.
for example,
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
     #include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
     int main()
     {
             puts(&quot;welcome to WIKIPEDIA!!!&quot;);
     }
&lt;/source&gt;
''output:''
 welcome to WIKIPEDIA!!!

It simply prints the string as it is. It always ends with semicolon, as it is a complete c statement. It also places the cursor to the next line.
It is same as [[printf()]] function or we can say printf()'s  simplified function is puts(). It displays the whole string but it doesn't consider all formatting job as in printf(). We can pass only one argument at a time to puts(), and thus one puts() function displays only one string.

We can also pass a variable to put()
for example,
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
     #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
     int main()
     {
           char str[] = &quot;welcome to WIKIPEDIA!!!&quot;;
           puts(str);
     }
&lt;/source&gt;
''output:''
 welcome to WIKIPEDIA!!!

The string gets stored at s[] and puts(s) is called it displays the string.

      int puts(const char *str)

In this puts() function writes string str and a newline to [[stdout]]. This function begins copying from address which is specified in the function (here it is str) till the null char occurs i.e. '\o' and this char doesn't get copy to stdout. while it returns [[EOF]] if an error occur,otherwise non-negative value.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The C library provides us with &lt;code&gt;'''difftime'''&lt;/code&gt; function which returns the time elapsed between two calendar dates. This function is defined in the header file &lt;code&gt;time.h&lt;/code&gt;. It returns the difference  (t2 - t1), where t1 is initial time and t2 is end time in seconds as a double-precision floating point number. This function is significant because there are no general arithmetic operations defined on type  time_t.

[[Category:time.h]]

The function difftime is declared in the header file &quot;time.h&quot;.

Syntax:
double difftime(time_t time2, time_t time1);

prolog:
difftime subtracts time1 from time2 to calculate the time elapsed between time1 and time2.
The value is calculated in seconds elapsed.
The arguments are normally obtained by two calls to the time function.

Return Value:
Returns the difference between time1 and time2 in seconds.

Example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
main()
{
        int sec;
        time_t start_time, finish_time;
        time(&amp;start_time); //in time.h header file
        for ( sec = 1; sec &lt;= 6; sec++)
        {
                printf(&quot;%d\r&quot;, sec);
                sleep(1);
        }
        time(&amp;finish_time);
        printf(&quot;\nDifference is  %.2f seconds&quot;,difftime(finish_time, start_time));
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Output:
---------
6

Difference is 6.00 seconds</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In computing, '''ctime''' is the number of seconds since 0:00:00 January 1, 1970 UTC. Commonly stored as a 32 bit signed integer, this number is used for pinpointing dates in many computers and operating systems, such as Linux and UNIX variants, as well as some programming languages. It will overflow in 2038 and cause the year 2038 problem; some expect this will be a profitable non-event similar to Y2K.

'''ctime''' is also a Unix library call which returns the local time as a human readable ASCII string.

'''ctime''' in a Unix filesystem is a file attribute which tells when the file's inode was last modified.

{{lowercase|title=time.h}}
In [[C (programming language)|C]] programming language '''time.h''' (used as '''ctime''' in [[C++]]) is a [[header file]] defined in the [[C Standard Library]] that contains [[system time|time and date]] function declarations to provide standardized access to time/date manipulation and formatting.

==Functions==

;&lt;code&gt;char *'''asctime'''(const struct tm* ''tmptr'')&lt;/code&gt;
:  Convert &lt;code&gt;tm&lt;/code&gt; to a string in the format &quot;Www Mmm dd hh:mm:ss yyyy&quot;, where Www is the weekday, Mmm the month in letters, dd the day of the month, hh:mm:ss the time, and yyyy the year. The string is followed by a [[newline]] and a terminating [[null character]], containing a total of 26 characters. The string pointed at is statically allocated and shared by &lt;code&gt;ctime&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;asctime&lt;/code&gt; functions. Each time one of these functions is called the contents of the string is overwritten.
;&lt;code&gt;clock_t '''clock'''(void)&lt;/code&gt;
:  Return number of clock ticks since process start.
;&lt;code&gt;char* '''ctime'''(const time_t* ''timer'')&lt;/code&gt;
:  Convert &lt;code&gt;[[time_t]]&lt;/code&gt; time value to string in the same format as &lt;code&gt;asctime&lt;/code&gt;. The string pointed is statically allocated and shared by &lt;code&gt;ctime&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;asctime&lt;/code&gt; functions. Each time one of these functions is called the content of the string is overwritten. &lt;code&gt;ctime&lt;/code&gt; also uses internally the buffer used by &lt;code&gt;gmtime&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;localtime&lt;/code&gt; as return value, so a call to this function will overwrite this.
;&lt;code&gt;double '''difftime'''(time_t ''timer2'', time_t ''timer1'')&lt;/code&gt;
:  Returns timer2 minus timer1 to give the difference in seconds between the two times.
;&lt;code&gt;struct tm* '''gmtime'''(const time_t* ''timer'')&lt;/code&gt;
:  Convert a &lt;code&gt;[[time_t]]&lt;/code&gt; value to a tm structure as UTC time. This structure is statically allocated and shared by &lt;code&gt;gmtime&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;localtime&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ctime&lt;/code&gt; functions. Each time one of these functions is called the content of the structure is overwritten.
;&lt;code&gt;struct tm* '''gmtime_r'''(const time_t* ''timer'', struct tm* ''result'')&lt;/code&gt;
:  Convert a &lt;code&gt;[[time_t]]&lt;/code&gt; value to a tm structure as UTC time. The time is stored in the tm [[Struct (C programming language)|struct]] referred to by ''result''. This function is the [[Thread safety|thread-safe]] version of &lt;code&gt;gmtime&lt;/code&gt;.
;&lt;code&gt;struct tm* '''localtime'''(const time_t* ''timer'')&lt;/code&gt;
:  Convert a &lt;code&gt;[[time_t]]&lt;/code&gt; time value to a tm structure as local time (ie time adjusted for the local time zone and daylight savings). This structure is statically allocated and shared by &lt;code&gt;gmtime&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;localtime&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ctime&lt;/code&gt; functions. Each time one of these functions is called the content of the structure is overwritten.
;&lt;code&gt;[[time_t]] '''mktime'''([[Struct (C programming language)|struct]] tm* ''ptm'')&lt;/code&gt;
:  Convert &lt;code&gt;tm&lt;/code&gt; to a &lt;code&gt;[[time_t]]&lt;/code&gt; time value. Checks the members of the tm structure passed as parameter ''ptm'' adjusting the values if the ones provided are not in the possible range or they are incomplete or mistaken and then translates that structure to a [[time_t]] value that is returned. The original values of ''tm_wday'' and ''tm_yday'' members of ''ptm'' are ignored and filled with the correspondent ones to the calculated date. The range of ''tm_mday'' is not checked until ''tm_mon'' and ''tm_year'' are determined. On error, a -1 value is returned.
;&lt;code&gt;[[time_t]] '''time'''(time_t* ''timer'')&lt;/code&gt;
:  Get the current time (number of seconds from the [[Unix time|epoch]]) from the system clock. Stores that value in &lt;code&gt;timer&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;timer&lt;/code&gt; is null, the value is not stored, but it is still returned by the function.
;&lt;code&gt;[[size t]] '''strftime'''(char* ''s'', [[size t]] ''n'', [[const]] char* ''format'', [[const]] [[Struct (C programming language)|struct]] tm* ''tptr'')&lt;/code&gt;
:  Format &lt;code&gt;tm&lt;/code&gt; into a date/time string.

;&lt;code&gt;char * '''strptime'''(const char* ''buf'', const char* ''format'', struct tm* ''tptr'')&lt;/code&gt;
:  Scan values from &lt;code&gt;buf&lt;/code&gt; string into &lt;code&gt;tptr&lt;/code&gt; struct. On success it returns pointer to the character following the last character parsed. Otherwise it returns null.
;&lt;code&gt;time_t '''timegm'''(struct tm *brokentime)&lt;/code&gt;
:  timegm is functionally identical to mktime except it always takes the input values to be Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) regardless of any local time zone setting. Note that timegm is the inverse of gmtime.
:  '''Portability note:'''  mktime is essentially universally available.  timegm is rather rare.  For the most portable (but non-thread safe) conversion from a UTC broken-down time to a simple time, set the TZ environment variable to UTC, call mktime, then set TZ back.

=== Unix extensions ===
The [[Single UNIX Specification]] (IEEE 1003.1, formerly POSIX) adds two functions to &lt;code&gt;time.h&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;'''asctime_r'''&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/asctime.html asctime]. The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7, IEEE Std 1003.1-2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;code&gt;'''ctime_r'''&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/ctime.html ctime]. The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7, IEEE Std 1003.1-2008.&lt;/ref&gt; These are [[Reentrant (subroutine)|reentrant]] versions of &lt;code&gt;asctime&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ctime&lt;/code&gt;. Both functions require the caller to provide a buffer in which to store the textual representation of a moment in time.
The following sample demonstrates, how to use the reentrant version of localtime and asctime:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#define _POSIX_C_SOURCE 200112L
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    time_t rawtime;
    struct tm * timeinfo;
    struct tm   timeinfoBuffer;
    char *result;

    time(&amp;rawtime);
    /* call localtime */
    timeinfo = localtime_r(&amp;rawtime , &amp;timeinfoBuffer);
    /* allocate memory for the result of asctime call*/
    result = malloc(26 * sizeof(char));
    /* call reentrant asctime function */
    result = asctime_r(timeinfo, result);
    printf(&quot;The current date/time is: %s&quot;, result);
    /* free allocated memory */
    free(result);

    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Since these functions are not in the C++ standard, they do not belong to the namespace &lt;code&gt;std&lt;/code&gt; in that language.
&lt;vinu.h&gt;

==Constants==
;&lt;code&gt;CLK_PER_SEC&lt;/code&gt;
:  Constant that defines the number of clock ticks per second. Used by the clock() function.
;&lt;code&gt;CLOCKS_PER_SEC&lt;/code&gt;
:  An alternative name for CLK_PER_SEC used in its place in some libraries.
;&lt;code&gt;CLK_TCK&lt;/code&gt;
:  Obsolete macro for CLK_PER_SEC.

==Data types==
;&lt;code&gt;clock_t&lt;/code&gt;
:  Data type returned by clock().&lt;br&gt;Generally defined as int or long int.
;&lt;code&gt;[[time_t]]&lt;/code&gt;
:  Data type returned by time().&lt;br&gt;Generally defined as int or long int.
;&lt;code&gt;[[Struct (C programming language)|struct]] tm&lt;/code&gt;
:  A &quot;broken-down&quot; (componentized) calendar representation of time.

===Calendar time===
Calendar time (also known as &quot;broken-down time&quot;) in the C standard library is represented as the &lt;code&gt;[[Struct (C programming language)|struct]]&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;tm&lt;/code&gt; structure, consisting of the following members:
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot;
|-
! width=25%|Member || Description
|-
| &lt;code&gt;[[Integer (computer science)|int]] tm_hour&lt;/code&gt;  || hour (0 – 23)
|-
| &lt;code&gt;int tm_isdst&lt;/code&gt; || [[Daylight Saving Time|Daylight saving time]] enabled (&gt; 0), disabled (= 0), or unknown (&lt; 0)
|-
| &lt;code&gt;int tm_mday&lt;/code&gt;  || day of the month (1 – 31)
|-
| &lt;code&gt;int tm_min&lt;/code&gt; || minutes (0 – 59)
|-
| &lt;code&gt;int tm_mon&lt;/code&gt; || month (0 – 11, 0 = January)
|-
| &lt;code&gt;int tm_sec&lt;/code&gt; || seconds (0 – 60, 60 = Leap second)
|-
| &lt;code&gt;int tm_wday&lt;/code&gt; || day of the week (0 – 6, 0 = Sunday)
|-
| &lt;code&gt;int tm_yday&lt;/code&gt; || day of the year (0 – 365)
|-
| &lt;code&gt;int tm_year&lt;/code&gt; || year since 1900
|}

==Examples==

This source code snippet prints the current time to the standard output stream.
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;
 
int main(void)
{
    time_t timer = time(NULL);

{{lowercase|setvbuf}}
&lt;code&gt;'''setvbuf'''&lt;/code&gt; is a [[Subroutine|function]] in [[C programming language|standard C]] which lets the programmer control the buffering of a file stream. It is declared in &lt;[[stdio.h]]&gt;; its function prototype is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;int setvbuf(FILE *stream, char *buf, int mode, size_t size);&lt;/source&gt;

The ''stream'' argument is a pointer to the file stream for which the relevant buffering operations will be performed; ''buf'' is a character array of ''size'' in length, or a [[null pointer]]; and ''mode'' is the kind of buffering desired: &lt;code&gt;_IOFBF&lt;/code&gt;, for fully buffered, &lt;code&gt;_IOLBF&lt;/code&gt; for line buffered and &lt;code&gt;_IONBF&lt;/code&gt; for unbuffered. These three macros are defined in &lt;stdio.h&gt;. &lt;code&gt;setvbuf&lt;/code&gt; returns zero on success or nonzero on failure.

If ''buf'' is a [[null pointer]], the system will [[malloc|dynamically allocate]] a buffer of the specified size (''size'' characters). If ''mode'' is &lt;code&gt;_IONBF&lt;/code&gt;, the stream I/O will not be buffered, causing each subsequent I/O operation on the stream to be performed immediately, and the ''buf'' and ''size'' arguments are ignored.

A related function, &lt;code&gt;'''setbuf'''&lt;/code&gt; also controls the buffering of a file stream. Unlike &lt;code&gt;setvbuf&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;setbuf&lt;/code&gt; takes only two arguments. The prototype is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;void setbuf(FILE *stream, char *buf);&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;setbuf&lt;/code&gt;'s behavior is equivalent to:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;(void)setvbuf(stream, buf, buf ? _IOFBF : _IONBF, BUFSIZ);&lt;/source&gt;

That is, if ''buf'' is not &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;, set the stream to fully buffered using the given buffer; otherwise, set the stream to unbuffered. If a buffer is provided to &lt;code&gt;setbuf&lt;/code&gt;, it must be at least &lt;code&gt;BUFSIZ&lt;/code&gt; bytes long. The function always succeeds.

The code below is very unstable and might not work properly on specific compilers. It may even buffer overflow..  C99 says that setvbuf may not be called after writing to the stream, so this code invokes undefined behavior.  C99 footnote 230 (non-normative) says the stream should be closed before buf is deallocated at the end of main.

== Example ==

The output of this program should be ''Hello world'' followed by a newline.
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main(void) {
    char buf[42];

    if(setvbuf(stdout, buf, _IOFBF, sizeof buf)) {
        perror(&quot;failed to change the buffer of stdout&quot;);
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
    printf(&quot;He&quot;);
    /* The buffer contains &quot;He&quot;; nothing is written yet to stdout */
    fflush(stdout); /* &quot;He&quot; is actually written to stdout */

    if(setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0)) {
        perror(&quot;failed to change the buffer of stdout&quot;);
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
    printf(&quot;llo w&quot;); /* &quot;llo w&quot; is written to stdout, there is no buffering */

    if(setvbuf(stdout, buf, _IOLBF, sizeof buf)) {
        perror(&quot;failed to change the buffer of stdout&quot;);
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
    printf(&quot;orld&quot;); /* The buffer now contains &quot;orld&quot;; nothing is written yet to stdout */
    putchar('\n'); /* stdout is line buffered; everything in the buffer is now written to stdout along with the newline */

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

'''rewind''' is a function in the [[C programming language]] that is specified in the &lt;code&gt;[[stdio.h]]&lt;/code&gt; library [[header file]]. The function moves the the file position indicator to the beginning of the specified stream, while also clearing the error and EOF flags associated with that stream.&lt;ref name=&quot;rewind&quot;&gt;[http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/rewind.html], The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7, IEEE Std 1003.1-2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;code&gt;rewind&lt;/code&gt; acts as if &lt;code&gt;fseek(stream, 0L, SEEK_SET)&lt;/code&gt; was called for the stream passed, except that &lt;code&gt;rewind&lt;/code&gt; causes the error indicator to also be cleared.

==Syntax==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
void rewind( FILE *stream );
&lt;/source&gt;

{{lowercase|title=rename (C)}}
'''rename''' is a function in the [[C programming language]] that renames a certain file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | url=http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf 
 | title=ISO/IEC 9899:1999 specification
 | at=p. 268, § 7.19.4.2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prototype of the function is:
:&lt;code&gt;int rename(const char *oldname, const char *newname)&lt;/code&gt;

Zero is returned upon success. Other integers are returned upon failure and &lt;code&gt;[[errno]]&lt;/code&gt; is set to an error code in this case.

The rename function is specified in the [[stdio.h]] library [[header file]] in C and the &lt;code&gt;cstdio&lt;/code&gt; header in [[C++]]. It is specified in [[ANSI C]].

In [[POSIX]], rename will fail (with [[EXDEV]]) if the old and new names are on different mounted [[file system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{man|sh|rename|SUS|rename a file}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a call to rename succeeds it is guaranteed to have been [[Atomic operation|atomic]] from the point of view of the current host (i.e., another program would only see the file with the old name or the file with the new name, not both or neither of them).

The Windows C library version of rename fails if the destination file already exists (POSIX would only fail if the user does not have permission to remove the destination file). Although the underlying WIN32 call has (since Win2K) had an option to replicate the POSIX atomic behavior, the library has never been fixed to use this.

'''remove''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] in [[C programming language]] that removes a certain file. It is included in the [[C standard library]] [[header file]] &lt;code&gt;[[stdio.h]]&lt;/code&gt;.

The prototype of the function is as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int remove ( const char * filename );
&lt;/source&gt;

If successful, the function returns zero. Nonzero value is returned on failure and &lt;code&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt; variable is set to corresponding error code.

==Sample usage==

The following program demonstrates common usage of &lt;code&gt;remove&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() 
{
    const char *filename = &quot;a.txt&quot;;
    remove (filename);
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

To implement a simple remove utility:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(char* argv[], int argc) 
{
    if (argc &gt; 1) {
        return remove (argv[1]);
    }else{
        return -1;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

'''putchar''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] in the [[C programming language]] that writes a single [[character (computing)|character]] to the [[standard stream#Standard output|standard output]] stream, [[stdout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | url=http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf 
 | title=ISO/IEC 9899:1999 specification
 | at=p. 299, § 7.19.7.9
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its prototype is as follows:
:&lt;code&gt;int putchar (int character)&lt;/code&gt;

The character to be printed is fed into the function as an argument, and if the writing is successful, the argument character is returned. Otherwise, [[end-of-file]] is returned.

The &lt;code&gt;putchar&lt;/code&gt; function is specified in the [[C standard library]] [[header file]] [[stdio.h]].

==Sample usage==
The following program uses &lt;code&gt;[[getchar]]&lt;/code&gt; to read characters into an array and print them out using the &lt;code&gt;putchar&lt;/code&gt; function after an [[end-of-file]] character is found.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

 int main(void)
 {
   char str[1000];
   int ch, i, n = 0;
  
   while ((ch = getchar()) != EOF &amp;&amp; n &lt; 1000)
     str[n++] = ch;
	   
   for (i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)
     putchar(str[i]);

   putchar('\n'); /* trailing '\n' needed in Standard C */
	
   return 0;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

The program specifies the reading length's maximum value at 1000 characters. It will stop reading either after reading 1000 characters or after reading in an end-of-file indicator, whichever comes first.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''putc''' is the function in [[C Programming/C Reference/stdio.h|stdio.h]]. It is simplest way to write the file once it is open. It writes the character to stream and advances the position indicator. It is output function.
The character is written at the current position of the stream as indicated by the internal position indicator, which is then advanced one character.

&lt;code&gt;putc&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;fputc&lt;/code&gt; and also expects a stream as parameter, but &lt;code&gt;putc&lt;/code&gt; may be implemented as a macro, so the argument passed should not be an expression with potential side effects.

See [[C Programming/C Reference/stdio.h/putchar|putchar]] for a similar function without stream parameter.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
int putc ( int character, FILE * stream );
&lt;/source&gt;

==Parameters==
;character: Character to be written. The character is passed as its int promotion.
;stream: Pointer to a FILE object that identifies the stream where the character is to be written. 

==Return value==
If there are no errors, the same character that has been written is returned.
If an error occurs, EOF is returned and the error indicator is set.


==Example==
/* putc example: alphabet writer */
&lt;Source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main ()
{
  FILE *fp;
  char c;

  fp = fopen(&quot;alphabet.txt&quot;, &quot;wt&quot;);
  for (c = 'A' ; c &lt;= 'Z' ; c++)
    {
     putc (c , fp);
    }
  fclose (fp);
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Output==
This example program creates a file called alphabet.txt and writes ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ to it.

The [[POSIX]] error function, '''perror''', is used in [[C programming language|C]] and [[C++]] to print an error message to [[stderr]], based on the error state stored in [[errno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | url=http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf 
 | title=ISO/IEC 9899:1999 specification
 | at=p. 305, § 7.19.10.2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;It prints str and an implementation-defined error message corresponding to the global variable errno.

==History==

The definition of '''perror''' was first released in Issue 1 of the [[System V Interface Definition]].

==Usage==

===Inclusion===

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Declaration===
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
void perror(const char* prefix);
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example===
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
int fd = open(&quot;/etc/passwd&quot;, O_RDONLY);
if (fd == -1) {
    perror(&quot;open&quot;);
    exit(1); 
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Semantics===

If the parameter ''prefix'' is non-NULL, '''perror''' will first print ''prefix'' followed by a colon and a space to [[stderr|standard error]]. Then, it will print the result of [[strerror]] to [[stderr|standard error]], followed by a newline character. For instance the above example may print

 open: Permission denied

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;code&gt;gets&lt;/code&gt;''' is a function in the [[C standard library]], declared in the [[header file]] &lt;code&gt;[[stdio.h]]&lt;/code&gt;, that reads a line from the [[standard input]] and stores it in a buffer provided by the caller.

Use of &lt;code&gt;gets&lt;/code&gt; is strongly discouraged. It is left in the [[C89 (C version)|C89]] and [[C99]] standards for [[backward compatibility]] (but officially deprecated in late revisions of C99). It is removed from the [[C11]] standard&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.open-std.org/Jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1548.pdf n1548], p.xiv&lt;/ref&gt; and instead a range checking alternative &lt;code&gt;gets_s&lt;/code&gt; is introduced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.open-std.org/Jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1548.pdf n1548], K.3.5.4.1&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[development tool]]s such as [[GNU linker|GNU ld]] emit warnings when code using &lt;code&gt;gets&lt;/code&gt; is [[Linker (computing)|linked]].

== Implementation ==

It might be implemented as follows (using &lt;code&gt;[[getchar]]&lt;/code&gt;):
&lt;!-- Please don't change me without commenting on the Talk page. --&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char *
gets (char *s)
{
    char * ch = s;
    int k;
	
    /* until we read a newline */
    while ((k = getchar ()) != '\n') {

        if (k == EOF) {
            /* EOF at start of line or errors other than EOF return NULL */
            if (ch == s || !feof(stdin)) 
                return NULL;

            break;
        }
		
        /* character is stored at address, and pointer is incremented */
        *ch++ = k;
    }
		
    /* Null-terminating character added */
    *ch = '\0';
		
    /* return original pointer */
    return s; 
}
&lt;/source&gt;
The programmer must know a maximum limit for the number of characters &lt;code&gt;gets&lt;/code&gt; will read so he can ensure the buffer is big enough. This is impossible without knowledge of the data. This design flaw leads to bugs and opens a gate for [[exploit (computer security)|exploiting computer security]] through a [[buffer overflow]]. Many sources advise programmers to ''never'' use &lt;code&gt;gets&lt;/code&gt; in new programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite manual

It has been used to break computer security.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
Other line input functions may be used instead of &lt;code&gt;gets&lt;/code&gt;, so as to avoid buffer overflow bugs. A simple alternative is &lt;code&gt;[[fgets]]&lt;/code&gt;. When replacing code of the form

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char buffer[BUFFERSIZE];
gets(buffer);
&lt;/source&gt;
with code of the form
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char buffer[BUFFERSIZE];
fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);
&lt;/source&gt;

one must keep in mind that the &lt;code&gt;fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin)&lt;/code&gt; call differs from &lt;code&gt;gets(buffer)&lt;/code&gt; not only in [[buffer overflow protection]], but also in that &lt;code&gt;fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin)&lt;/code&gt; preserves the terminating newline (if the input line is terminated by a newline), while &lt;code&gt;gets(buffer)&lt;/code&gt; discards it.

The first edition of ''[[The C Programming Language (book)|The C Programming Language]]'' did not use &lt;code&gt;gets&lt;/code&gt; but instead described a much safer function &lt;code&gt;getline(buffer, length)&lt;/code&gt;, which would not overflow the buffer and would return the useful information of how many bytes were read (which would allow NUL to be typed) or -1 on error or EOF. It is unclear why &lt;tt&gt;gets&lt;/tt&gt; ended up in the C standard library rather than this function.

[[POSIX]]-2008 defines &lt;code&gt;getline(char **buffer, size_t *buffersize, FILE*)&lt;/code&gt; that reallocates the buffer as needed to hold the input line (note the extra level of indirection on the buffer and size).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/getline.html |title=getdelim |publisher=The Open Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[C1X]] proposal has a replacement function &lt;code&gt;gets_s(char* buffer, size_t n)&lt;/code&gt; that returns an empty string and consumes the whole current line if the line does not fit in &lt;code&gt;n-1&lt;/code&gt; characters.

== Safe use ==
Safe use of &lt;code&gt;gets&lt;/code&gt; requires the programmer to ensure that buffer overflows cannot be a problem. The only portable way is to somehow make sure the input file cannot contain lines longer than the buffer, such as by ensuring that the file was created by a program that cannot write such lines. There are a number of other relatively complicated ways to protect from buffer overflows, with varying degrees of portability. One possibility is to use a [[guard page]] to protect memory. Alone, this turns exploitable buffer overflows into mere [[crash (computing)|crash]]es. In combination with an [[exception handler]], such as one involving &lt;code&gt;[[SIGSEGV]]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[[sigaction]]&lt;/code&gt;, the guard page can allow graceful [[error handling]].

      <comment>moved [[Transwiki:Getchar]] to [[C Programming/C Reference/stdio.h/getchar]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{lowercase|title=getchar}}

'''getchar''' is a function in [[C programming language]] that reads a single [[character (computing)|character]] from the standard input stream [[stdin]], regardless of what it is, and returns it to the program. It is specified in ANSI-C and is the most basic input function in C. It is included in the [[stdio.h]] header file.

The &lt;code&gt;getchar&lt;/code&gt; function prototype is&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phim.unibe.ch/comp_doc/c_manual/C/FUNCTIONS/getchar.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;int getchar(void);&lt;/code&gt;

==Sample usage==
The following program uses &lt;code&gt;getchar&lt;/code&gt; to read characters into an array and print them out using the [[putchar]] function after an [[end-of-file]] character is found.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

 int main(void)
 {
   char str[1000];
   int ch, n = 0;

   while ((ch = getchar()) != EOF &amp;&amp; n &lt; 1000) {
      str[n] = ch;
      ++n;
   }
   
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)
      putchar(str[i]);
   
   putchar('\n'); /* trailing '\n' needed in Standard C */

   return 0;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

The program specifies the reading length's maximum value at 1000 characters. It will stop reading either after reading 1000 characters or after reading in an [[end-of-file]] indicator, whichever comes first.

==Common mistake==

A common mistake when using &lt;code&gt;getchar&lt;/code&gt; is to assign the result to a variable of type &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; before comparing it to '''EOF'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://c-faq.com/stdio/getcharc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The following example shows this mistake:

&lt;pre&gt;
   char c;
   while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) { /* Bad! */
      putchar(c);
   }
&lt;/pre&gt;

Consider a system in which &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;s are 8 bits wide, representing 256 different values. &lt;code&gt;getchar&lt;/code&gt; may return any of the 256 possible characters, and it also may return '''EOF''' to indicate end-of-file, for a total of 257 different possible return values.

When &lt;code&gt;getchar&lt;/code&gt;'s result is assigned to a &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, which can represent only 256 different values, there is necessarily some loss of information - when packing 257 items into 256 slots, there must be a collision. The '''EOF''' value, when converted to &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, becomes indistinguishable from whichever one of the 256 characters shares its numerical value. If that character is found in the file, the above example will mistake it for an end-of-file indicator.

If the &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; type is unsigned, then the opposite effect occurs. Because '''EOF''' is negative, it can never be equal to any unsigned &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, so the above example will not terminate at end-of-file. It will loop forever, repeatedly printing the character which results from converting '''EOF''' to a &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;.

On systems where &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; are the same size, even the &quot;good&quot; example in the [[#Sample usage|previous section]] will suffer from the indistinguishability of '''EOF''' and some character's value. The proper way to handle this situation is to check [[feof]] and [[ferror]] after &lt;code&gt;getchar&lt;/code&gt; returns '''EOF'''. If &lt;code&gt;feof&lt;/code&gt; indicates that end-of-file has not been reached, and &lt;code&gt;ferror&lt;/code&gt; indicates that no errors have occurred, then the '''EOF''' returned by &lt;code&gt;getchar&lt;/code&gt; can be assumed to represent an actual character. These extra checks are rarely done, because most programmers assume that their code will never need to run on one of these &quot;big &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;&quot; systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{merge to|C_file_input/output|date=October 2011}}
'''getc''' is one of the character input function. getc reads next character from file and it needs file pointer to tell it which file. It is simplest function to read the file.

Like [[getchar]], getc() may be implemented macro instead of function. getc is equivalent to [[fgetc]].
getc returns the next character from the stream referred to by fp; it returns EOF for End Of File or error.

==Syntax==
 int getc( FILE * stream);
Here, parameter stream is the pointer to a FILE object which identify the stream on which the operation is to be performed.

==Example==
/*getc example*/
&lt;Source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main()
{
FILE *fp;
int c;
int n = 0;
fp = fopen(&quot;myfile.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;);
  if(fp == NULL)
     perror (&quot;Error opening file&quot;);
  else
  {
     do  {
         c = getc(fp);
         if(c == '#')
         n++;
         }
     while(c != EOF);
  fclose(fp);
  printf (&quot;File contains %d#.\n&quot;,n);
  }
 return 0;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Above program read the file called myfile.txt character by character and uses n variable to count '#' character contained in file.

==Return Value==
Character read is returned as an int value.

If the End-of-File is reached or error in reading occurs, function returns EOF and corresponding error indicator. We can use either [[ferror]] or [[feof]] to determine whether an error happened or EOF reached.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The &lt;code&gt;'''fread'''&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;'''fwrite'''&lt;/code&gt; functions respectively provide the [[computer file|file]] operations of [[input and output]]. &lt;code&gt;fread&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fwrite&lt;/code&gt; are [[function prototype|declared]] in &lt;code&gt;&lt;[[stdio.h]]&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

==Writing a file using fwrite==
fwrite is defined as
:&lt;code&gt;int fwrite ( const void * array, size_t size, size_t count, FILE * stream ); &lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;fwrite&lt;/code&gt; function writes a block of data to the stream. It will write an [[array]] of &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; elements to the current position in the stream. For each element, it will write &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt; bytes. The position indicator of the stream will be advanced by the number of bytes written successfully.

The function will return the number of elements written successfully. The return value will be equal to &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; if the write completes successfully. In case of a write error, the return value will be less than &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt;.

==Example==
The following program opens a file named &lt;tt&gt;sample[[.txt]]&lt;/tt&gt;, writes an array of characters to the file, and closes it. 
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 
 int main(void)
 {
     FILE *file_ptr;
     int iCount;
     char arr[6] = &quot;hello&quot;;
 
     file_ptr = fopen(&quot;sample.txt&quot;, &quot;wb&quot;);
     iCount = fwrite(arr, 1, 5, file_ptr);
     fclose(file_ptr);
 
     return 0;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

'''fseek''' is a [[C (programming language)|C]] [[Subroutine|function]] belonging to the [[ANSI C standard library]], and included in the file [[stdio.h]]. Its purpose is to change the file position indicator for the specified stream.  Because fseek uses 32 bit values on many platforms it has a limitation of maximum 2 gigabyte seeks. '''fseeko64''' would be used for larger offsets.

== Function prototype ==
:&lt;code&gt;int fseek('''FILE''' ''*stream_pointer'', '''long''' ''offset'', '''int''' ''origin'');&lt;/code&gt;

The fseek function moves the file pointer associated with the stream to a new location that is offset bytes from origin

Argument meaning:
* ''stream_pointer'' is a pointer to the stream ''FILE'' structure of which the position indicator should be changed;
* ''offset'' is a ''long'' integer which specifies the number of bytes from ''origin'' where the position indicator should be placed;
* ''origin'' is an integer which specifies the origin position. It can be:
**SEEK_SET: origin is the start of the stream
**SEEK_CUR: origin is the current position
**SEEK_END: origin is the end of the stream

== Return value ==
The return value is an ''integer'' which mean:
* ''0'' (zero) : function performed successfully in the stream
* ''nonzero'' : an error occurred
* On devices incapable of seeking, the return value is undefined.

Note that each error number has a distinct meaning. The meaning can be revealed by checking ''[[errno.h]]''.

=== Example ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  FILE *file_handle;
  long int file_length;
  
  file_handle = fopen(&quot;file.bin&quot;,&quot;rb&quot;);
  if(fseek(file_handle, 0, SEEK_END)) {
    puts(&quot;Error while seeking to end of file&quot;);
    return 1;
  }
  file_length = ftell(file_handle);
  if (file_length &lt; 0) {
    puts(&quot;Error while reading file position&quot;);
    return 2;
  }
  
  printf(&quot;File length: %d bytes\n&quot;, file_length);
  fclose(file_handle);
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
This program code opens a file called ''file.bin'' in read-only mode.  The length of the file is determined by seeking to the end and then reading back the position of the file pointer.

'''fread''' is a [[Function (computer science)|function]] that reads [[Data buffer|buffer]]ed binary input from a [[Computer file|file]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | url=http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf 
 | title=ISO/IEC 9899:1999 specification
 | at=p. 301, § 7.19.8.1
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is included from the [[stdio.h]] [[header file]] in the [[standard C library]].

:&lt;code&gt;size_t fread (void * restrict ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE * restrict stream)&lt;/code&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;fread&lt;/code&gt; function copies &lt;code&gt;nmemb&lt;/code&gt; items of data of size &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt; from the named input &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt; into an array pointed to by &lt;code&gt;ptr&lt;/code&gt;. An item of data is a sequence of bytes (not necessarily terminated by a null byte) of length &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;fread&lt;/code&gt; stops appending bytes when &lt;code&gt;nmemb&lt;/code&gt; items have been read, [[end of file]] has been reached, or an error has occurred. Upon returning, &lt;code&gt;fread&lt;/code&gt; sets the file pointer in the stream pointing to the byte past the last byte that has been read. The contents of &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt; remain unchanged.  The &lt;code&gt;fread&lt;/code&gt; function returns the number of items actually read.  If &lt;code&gt;nmemb&lt;/code&gt; is zero, no action is taken and the function will return 0. 

==Diagnostics==
The function may fail with the following [[error code]]s: 
* ''EAGAIN'' - Cannot read the input stream immediately without blocking the process, and the O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file descriptor associated with stream. 
* ''EBADF'' - Not a valid [[file descriptor]] open for reading. 
* ''EINTR'' - The read operation was terminated by a signal before any data was read. 
* ''EIO'' - Cannot read from the controlling terminal. This happens when the process is in a background process group and the attempt by the process to read from its controlling terminal fails, either because the process group is orphaned, or because the process is ignoring or blocking the [[SIGTTIN]] signal. 
* ''ENOMEM'' - Insufficient storage space is available. 
* ''ENXIO'' - Attempt to read from a non-existent device, or from a device whose capabilities are exceeded.

'''fputs''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] in [[C programming language]] that writes an array of [[character (computing)|character]]s to a given file stream. &lt;code&gt;fputs&lt;/code&gt; stands for ''file put string''. It is included in the [[C standard library]] [[header file]] &lt;code&gt;[[stdio.h]]&lt;/code&gt;.

The function &lt;code&gt;fputs&lt;/code&gt; terminates after reaching terminating null character (&lt;code&gt;'\0'&lt;/code&gt;). The null character is not copied to the stream. The prototype of the function is as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int fputs ( const char * str, FILE * stream );
&lt;/source&gt;

The stream argument specifies the stream to which the string will be written. &lt;code&gt;stdout&lt;/code&gt; is commonly used here, for writing to the standard output. Otherwise, a &lt;code&gt;FILE *&lt;/code&gt; value returned by the &lt;code&gt;[[fopen]]()&lt;/code&gt; function is used.

==Sample usage==

The following example is 'hello world' program using &lt;code&gt;fputs&lt;code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()  {
    const char *buffer = &quot;Hello world!&quot;;
    fputs (buffer, stdout);
    return 0;
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

The following is a program that asks the user for his name and then writes it out:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main() {
    char name[50];
    fputs(&quot;What is your name? &quot;, stdout);
    fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin);
    fputs(name, stdout);
    return 0;
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

Many [[programming language]]s have functions that calculate [[absolute value]]s of numbers, either having the name '''abs''' or '''Abs'''. In languages such as [[C (programming language)|C]], it has variants for long integers and [[floating point]] numbers called '''labs''' and '''fabs'''. All the functions take a signed number as a parameter, and returns the absolute value of that number in the same [[data type]].

A very possible implementation of the &lt;code&gt;abs&lt;/code&gt; functions, written in [[pseudocode|pseudo-code]], would be:
 function abs (number n) {
   if n &gt;= 0 return n;
   else return -n;
 }

===[[C (programming language)|C]] or [[C++]]===
These functions are defined in the standard header &lt;code&gt;math.h&lt;/code&gt; for C and &lt;code&gt;cmath&lt;/code&gt; for C++:
 int abs (int i);
 long labs (long i);
 float fabs (float i);

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''strtok()'''

strtok is one of the C-library function.
The syntax of strtok () function is as follow:
Syntax:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
char *strtok( char *str1, const char *str2 );
&lt;/source&gt;

Description:
The strtok() function returns a pointer to the next &quot;token&quot; in str1, where str2 contains the delimiters that determine the token. strtok() returns NULL if no token is found. In order to convert a string to tokens, the first call to strtok() should have str1 point to the string to be tokenized. All calls after this should have str1 be NULL.

The final periodic trend for our discussion is electron affinity. We have talked about atomic structure, electronic configurations, size of the atoms and ionization energy. And now, the final periodic trend we will study is how an atom can gain an electron and the trends that exist in the Periodic Table.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Define electron affinity.
* Describe the trend for electron affinity on the Periodic Table.

==The Energy Process When an Electron is Added to an Atom==
Atoms can gain or lose electrons. When an atom gains an electron, energy is given off and is known as the electron affinity. '''Electron affinity''' is defined as the energy released when an electron is added to a gaseous atom or ion.

:&lt;math&gt;\text{T} + e^- \rightarrow \text{T}^-\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

When most reactions occur that involve the addition of an electron to a gaseous atom, potential energy is released.

:{| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\text{Br} + e^-\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\text{Br}^{1-}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;[\text{Ar}]4s^24p^5\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &amp;nbsp; || &lt;math&gt;[\text{Ar}]4s^24p^6\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Let's look at the electron configurations of a few of the elements and the trend that develops within groups and periods. Take a look at Table 10.10, the electron affinity for the Halogen family.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin:10px auto; text-align:center;&quot;
|+ Table 10.10: Electron Affinities for Group 17
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Element
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Electron Configuration
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Electron Affinity, kJ/mol
|-
| Fluorine (F) || [He]2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; || −328
|-
| Chlorine (Cl) || [Ne]3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''p''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; || −349
|-
| Bromine (Br) || [Ar]4''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;4''p''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; || −325
|-
| Iodine (I) || [Kr]5''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;5''p''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; || −295
|}

As you can see, the electron affinity generally decreases (becomes less negative) going down a group because of the increase in size of the atoms. Remember that the atoms located within a family but lower on the periodic table are larger since there are more electrons filling more energy levels. For example, an atom of chlorine is smaller than iodine; or, an atom of oxygen is smaller than sulfur. When an electron is added to a large atom, less energy is released because the electron cannot move as close to the nucleus as it can in a smaller atom. Therefore, as the atoms in a family get larger, the electron affinity gets smaller.

There is an exception to this when it involves certain small atoms. Electron affinity for fluorine is less than chlorine most likely due to the electron-electron repulsions that occur between the electrons where ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2. This phenomenon is observed in other families as well. For instance, the electron affinity for oxygen is less than the electron affinity for sulfur. Electron affinity of all of the elements in the second period is less than the ones below them due to the fact that the elements in the second period have such small electron clouds that electron repulsion is greater than that of the rest of the family.

==Nonmetals Tend to Have the Highest Electron Affinity==
Overall, the Periodic Table shows the general trend similar to the one below.

The general trend in the electron affinity for atoms is almost the same as the trend for ionization energy. This is because both electron affinity and ionization energy are highly related to atomic size. Large atoms have low ionization energy and low electron affinity. Therefore, they tend to lose electrons and do not tend to gain electrons. Small atoms, in general, are the opposite. Since they are small, they have high ionization energies and high electron affinities. Therefore, the small atoms tend to gain electrons and tend not to lose electrons. The major exception to this rule are the noble gases. They are small atoms and do follow the general trend for ionization energies. The noble gases, however, do not follow the general trend for electron affinities. Even though the noble gases are small atoms, their outer energy levels are completely filled with electrons and therefore, an added electron cannot enter their outer most energy level. Any electrons added to a noble gas would have to be the first electron in a new (larger) energy level. This causes the noble gases to have essentially zero electron affinity. This concept is discussed more thoroughly in the next chapter.

When atoms become ions, the process involves either the energy released through electron affinity or energy being absorbed with ionization energy. Therefore, the atoms that require a large amount of energy to release an electron will most likely be the atoms that give off the most energy while accepting an electron. In other words, non-metals will most easily gain electrons since they have large electron affinities and large ionization energies; and, metals will lose electrons since they have the low ionization energies and low electron affinities.

Now let's add this last periodic trend to our Periodic Table representation and our periodic trends are complete.

==Lesson Summary==
* Electron affinity is the energy required (or released) when an electron is added to a gaseous atom or ion. Electron affinity generally increases going up a group and increases left to right across a period.
* Non-metals tend to have the highest electron affinities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{dewikify}}

In [[computer programming]], the '''&lt;tt&gt;strlcpy&lt;/tt&gt;''' function is intended to replace the function &lt;tt&gt;[[strcpy]]&lt;/tt&gt; (which copies a string to a destination buffer) with a secure version that cannot overflow the destination buffer. It is almost always accompanied by the '''&lt;tt&gt;strlcat&lt;/tt&gt;''' function which provides a similar alternative to &lt;tt&gt;[[strcat]]&lt;/tt&gt; (which appends a source string to a destination buffer).

The standard C functions that can be used to avoid buffer overflow, &lt;tt&gt;[[strncpy]]&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;[[strncat]]&lt;/tt&gt;, have serious design flaws that make them difficult and unnecessarily slow to use correctly. &lt;tt&gt;strlcpy&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;strlcat&lt;/tt&gt; are designed so that correct usage is as simple as possible.

These are not [[C standard library]] functions, but are available in the libraries on several Unix operating systems, including [[BSD]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[IRIX]], with notable exception of [[glibc]] on [[Linux]], although it is available from [http://libbsd.freedesktop.org libbsd] instead.

== Usage ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
size_t strlcpy(char *destination, const char *source, size_t size);
size_t strlcat(char *destination, const char *source, size_t size);
&lt;/source&gt;

Like &lt;tt&gt;[[strncpy]]&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;str'''l'''cpy&lt;/tt&gt; takes the destination's size as a parameter and will not write more than that many bytes, to prevent [[buffer overflow]] (assuming &lt;tt&gt;size&lt;/tt&gt; is correct).  But, unlike &lt;tt&gt;str'''n'''cpy&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;str'''l'''cpy&lt;/tt&gt; ''always'' writes a single &lt;tt&gt;NUL&lt;/tt&gt; byte to the destination (if &lt;tt&gt;size&lt;/tt&gt; is not zero).  The resulting string is guaranteed to be &lt;tt&gt;NUL&lt;/tt&gt;-terminated even if truncated. Also it does not waste time writing multiple &lt;tt&gt;NUL&lt;/tt&gt; bytes to fill the rest of the buffer, unlike &lt;tt&gt;str'''n'''cpy&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gratisoft.us/todd/papers/strlcpy.html | title=strlcpy and strlcat - consistent, safe, string copy and concatenation. | author=Todd C. Miller | coauthors=Theo de Raadt | year=1999 | work=USENIX '99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, &lt;tt&gt;str'''l'''cpy&lt;/tt&gt; counts and returns the length of the entire source string (&lt;tt&gt;str'''n'''cpy&lt;/tt&gt; doesn't return a length).  This length can be compared to the destination buffer's size to check if it was truncated, and to work around truncation, for example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char *copy; // this will point at our copy of the string
size_t length; // this will hold the length of the string

// Copy to a fast block of memory on the stack:
char stack_buffer[128];
length = strlcpy(stack_buffer, source, sizeof(stack_buffer));

if (length &lt; sizeof(stack_buffer)) {
  // it fit, use the stack buffer
  copy = stack_buffer;
} else {
  // it was truncated, use a slower buffer on the heap: 
  copy = malloc(length+1);
  memcpy(copy, source, length+1);
}

// Now use the copy of the string. The length is often useful, too:
use(copy, length);

// free the buffer if we allocated it:
if (copy != stack_buffer) free(copy);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;str'''l'''cat&lt;/tt&gt; is equivalent to writing the appended strings to a temporary infinitely-large buffer, and then doing a &lt;tt&gt;strlcpy&lt;/tt&gt; from that buffer to the destination.

== History ==

&lt;tt&gt;strlcpy&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;strlcat&lt;/tt&gt; were developed by [[Todd C. Miller]] and [[Theo de Raadt]] and first implemented in [[OpenBSD]] version 2.4.  It has subsequently been adopted by a number of operating systems including [[FreeBSD]] (from version 3.3), [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[Mac OS X]] and GNU-based systems through libbsd. Many application packages and libraries include their own copies of these functions, including [[glib]], [[rsync]], [[Samba (software)|Samba]], [[KDE]], and the [[Linux kernel]] itself.

==Criticism==
[[GNU C Library]] maintainer [[Ulrich Drepper]] is among the critics of the &lt;tt&gt;strlcpy&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;strlcat&lt;/tt&gt; functions;&lt;ref name=&quot;libc-alpha-discussion-1&quot;&gt;[http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-alpha/ libc-alpha mailing list], selected messages from 8 August 2000 thread: [http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-alpha/2000-08/msg00053.html 53], [http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-alpha/2000-08/msg00060.html 60], [http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-alpha/2000-08/msg00061.html 61]&lt;/ref&gt; consequently these functions have not been added to glibc.  Drepper argues that &lt;tt&gt;strlcpy&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;strlcat&lt;/tt&gt; make truncation errors easier for a programmer to ignore and thus can introduce more bugs than they remove.&lt;ref name=&quot;libc-alpha-discussion-1&quot;/&gt;  His concern with possible truncation, when using any string function involving static allocation, is shared by others.&lt;ref&gt;Antill, James. [http://www.and.org/vstr/security#alloc Security with string APIs: Security relevant things to look for in a string library API]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The alternative recommended by Drepper is:

    *((char *) mempcpy (dst, src, n)) = '\0';

Other criticisms are that the functions are non-standard and that there are implementation differences between the [[BSD]] and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] implementations (the return value of &lt;tt&gt;strlcat&lt;/tt&gt;, when there is no NUL in the destination buffer, differs).&lt;ref&gt;Antill, James. [http://www.and.org/vstr/security#libcstring Security with string APIs]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is a standard library function of [[C language]].&lt;br&gt;This function is used to check if entered  wide character is lower case or not. 
a main difference between iswlower and islower is that islower returns nonzero value only if entered character is in the set (a to z), but an additional concept in iswlower is, it returns non zero value only when entered character is in between(a to z) and it is a [[wide character]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mkssoftware.com/docs/man3/iswlower.3.asp Defination]&lt;/ref&gt; It comes under standard library function '''wctype.h'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jrgraphix.net/man/I/iswlower Iswlower manual page]&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Syntax '''
&lt;Source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
# include &lt;wctype.c&gt;
int iswlower (wint_t wc);
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
The iswlower() function is designed to return non-zero(which is considered as true value) value if wc is a wide character and belongs to (a to z) And again it returns zero representing false value if it does not satisfy above condition
&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/wide/iswlower Return value of function]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

'''Parameters required'''&lt;/br&gt;
a wide character like wc in above example
&lt;/br&gt;'''Example'''
&lt;Source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
# include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include&lt;ctype.h&gt;
int main ()
{
	char a;
	int b;
	scanf (&quot;%c&quot;, &amp;a);
	b = iswlower(a);
return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The above code shows us how this function can be used.Thus if entered value is wide character and of lower case and do not contain any symbols, it returns a non zero value.Else it returns a zero.

==Name==
asctime(), asctime_r(),
==Introduction==
In [[C language]] function asctime() is included in library function [[time.h]]. This function translate time structure into an [[ASCII]] string. It will display in the form as '''Day Month Date Time Year\n\0'''. e.g. Sun Sep 5 10:56:01 2011\n\0. This function converts the broken-down time value into a string having same format as [[ctime()]]. The function asctime_r() does the same thing but it stores the string in user-supplied buffer having memory of at least '''26''' bytes.

==Description==
In C programming, functions asctime(), asctime_r() are used. We can obtain time by calling the functions '''gmtime()''',  '''gmtime64()''', '''localtime()'''. The asctime() function uses 24 hour clock. The days are given as: mon, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat, sun and months as: jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun, jul, aug, sep, oct, nov, dec. the new line character(\n) and blank spaces(/0) occupy last two positions of the string. The result produce by the string contains exactly 26 characters. asctime() always save this string to the same location. on every call to this function the old string gets overwrite. Time of this function starts from universal time that is 00:00:00 and date starts from january 1 1970.

      <comment>Fix header and note that it's POSIX</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In programming language C, '''strcasecmp''' is a function declared in the strings.h header file (or sometimes in string.h) that compares two strings irrespective of the case of characters.&lt;br /&gt;

This function is in POSIX.1-2001.
==Prototype==
             &lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;int strcasecmp(const char *f1, const char *f2);&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

This function returns an integer i :&lt;br /&gt;
i &gt; 0, if f1 is greater than f2&lt;br /&gt;
i &lt; 0, if f1 is found less than string f2 and&lt;br /&gt;
i = 0, if f1 is equal to f2.

==Example==
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
# include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
# include &lt;strings.h&gt;

== Edits to Muggles' Guide ==

I have noted the questions you added to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 36]]. In case you were not aware of this, those are study questions, meant to be answered as exercises by people actually studying the Harry Potter series as literary works. In the book chapter sections, these are usually broken into Review, questions answered in the chapter text, and Further Study, questions that you have to actually think about. Both the questions you put up are properly Further Study questions, as there is nothing in the book to answer them; and in fact one of them is already in the Further Study section for that chapter.

Did you really want answers to those questions? If so, ask on my talk page, and I'll tell you what I think. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:18, 18 October 2011 (UTC)</text>

==Reviewing &amp; Moderating==
The moderator serves two roles. The first, and most important, is to keep the discourse at simplemachines.org civil and friendly. The second is to try to keep the forum as enjoyable and helpful as possible. Moderation is not at all like support. When you are moderating, please think like a moderator.
*Keeping it civil, friendly, and clean
** If you see a post that is lowering the &quot;friendliness quotient&quot;, please use a PM to ask the poster to use words that will decrease the tension and increase the level of civility and friendliness.
** If you see a post that contains '''some''' clearly inappropriate content, make the edit. Inform the user, via PM, if possible.
** If you see a post that is clearly in violation of the site rules, do not hesitate to delete it. Inform the user, via PM, if possible.
** If posters continue to discourse in an unfriendly, un-civil, harrassing, vulgar, or hateful way, you may need to warn them, with a clear explanation of why their post violates the terms of use of this site.
** Moderation concerns can be discussed at the [http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?board=23.0 Moderation Concerns] boards on the forum.
*Keeping it helpful and enjoyable (and friendly, civil, and clean, too)
** If you see a request for support that might be in the wrong board, but is getting helpful community responses, there is no harm in leaving it where it is for a little while. You can always move it later.
** If you see a request for support that is not getting any response, you can move it. Leave a friendly, even apologetic note &quot;I hope you won't mind that I've moved this post to the Themes and Graphics board. I hope someone there has the answer to your question&quot;.
** Sometimes a support topic goes off-topic. If the original poster is already satisfied with the answer, and a couple of community members hang around to chat, this is OK. As long as the discourse is civil and friendly (see above).
** Sometimes, a second poster chimes in with exactly the same problem. It might be OK to leave this in the same thread, if the person offering support is offering exactly the same advice to both posters, this actually makes life easier for everyone.
** Sometimes, a second poster chimes in with a similar (but not exactly the same) problem. It will probably be better to split the topic, with a friendly, even apologetic note in the original thread. &quot;I hope you won't mind that I have given this issue its own topic at .... I hope this will save confusion and help you get help more quickly.&quot;
** Sometimes, a help-seeker makes two posts on the same problem, in different boards. They might not have been sure where to put the question, or they made a mistake and then could not delete their first post. Merge the two, if possible. Delete one if necessary. Leave a friendly, even apologetic note &quot;I hope you won't mind that I have deleted your other post on the same topic from the xxx board. I think this one is in the right place to get the help you need&quot;.
** If an off-topic chit-chat discussion springs up in the middle of a help topic, you can split it off into an appropriate Chit Chat board. Leave a friendly, even apologetic note to explain the split.
**Hosting Board
**Chit Chat
**Joke Board!
**News &amp; Politics

===Support ===
Only respond to a support question if you have something useful to communicate. Be sure of what you mean to put acrosss, and be sure to communicate it simply and well, and in a civil and friendly manner.
Communication is a two-way effort - this means that BOTH the poster and the reader need to
make the effort to understand the other's perspective and position. As a reader, it is easy to say &quot;I
read things as they're said - it's not my fault they wrote it like a jackass&quot; and as a poster it's easy
to say &quot;I'm honest, I'm blunt and I'm sorry if they can't deal with that&quot;. 

So, before you start typing, think about how all the ways you may have misinterpreted the post you are replying to. And before you hit &quot;submit&quot;, think about all the ways your post could be misinterpreted.
If you are feeling rushed, anxious, angry, or out-of-sorts, it could be difficult to meet high standards for communicate well and in a friendly way. In this case, take the day off. Come back when you are in a positive and friendly frame of mind.

When reviewing support requests, review the oldest first.
* Helpdesk: The &quot;Updated&quot; column header can be used to sort the open tickets by &quot;oldest first&quot;
* Support boards: The supporttopics script can be used to display the oldest open support questions first, by selecting the &quot;last&quot; link: http://www.simplemachines.org/supporttopics.php?set=support;sort=lastpost;asc

==Team Management==
{{User:AngelinaBelle/template/Did you know|above=Telling Your Family
|text=Some of our team members are minors. Sometimes it’s hard for them to explain to their family about their contributions to the team. If you find yourself in this position, just let a PM know and they’d be happy to telephone or write a letter to your parents to clarify your work.}}
===Adding New Team Member===
* Nominate for Apprenticeship. Make a post titled “Nomination for [member name]” Please always create a new topic each new nomination.
*Discussion. The entire team has a say in who is a potential team member. If you feel this nominee is going to be a productive and valuable member of our team, make a post stating your thoughts. Conversely, if you do not think the nominee will fit into the team, make sure to post the reasons. If you don’t tell us, we won’t know!
* Approval. Assuming the team agrees that the nominee should become a team member, they will be approved.
* Mentor is selected. Volunteers to mentor the new apprentice should be posting in the topic. A mentor will be selected from those who volunteer. If no one volunteers, a mentor may be assigned. 
* Even returning team members must go through the mentoring process. 
* Nominate for Invitation -- team members can discuss and then vote to approve the invitation.
* Invitation is made. A Team Leader, Assistant Project Manager or a Project Manager invites the nominee to become an apprentice
* They Accept. WHOO HOOO FRESH MEAT!
* Permissions Assigned. Assistant PM or PM gives the new Apprentice necessary access permissions
* Credits. Admin/PM must add them to the Team Page

===Removing a Team Member ===
Your team members depend on you -- they need your help. If you are not available, they will wonder if they should wait, or seek someone else who can help. 
* If you inform the rest of the team of a period of time during which you will be inactive, you will be placed on hiatus. When you return after that time, your active team status will be restored.
* If you remain inactive without giving notice to the team, you may be placed on hiatus after two weeks.
* If you are still on hiatus at the start of the following month, and have not given notice to the team, you may be removed from the team and given an SMF Friend badge.

===Mentoring a New Team Members===
*Understand the expectations for the position your apprentice is training for
* You may act as a mentor for someone that will be on any part of the SMF team.
*Be prepared to commit to being a mentor for at least 4 weeks.
** Some apprentices may be ready to join the team in less than 4 weeks.
** If the apprentice is not making progress after 4 weeks, it may be best to end the apprenticeship.
*Maintain one-on-one contact with the new member via email/IM at least four times per week
*You must be able to provide constructive feedback (see notes on communication)
*Remember, as a mentor – you represent the WHOLE TEAM
* You may put your name forward to be a mentor, or someone else on the team may suggest you. Your team leader or another member of the steering committee will give you the go-ahead to act as a mentor.# Review the job descriptions and responsibilities &amp; processes involved in the new member’s position

The mentoring process
# Wait for email/pm from the appropriate team lead, introducing you to the apprentice
# Confirm that the apprencie has the permissions required for an apprentice
# Introduce yourself to the apprentice, pass them the manual and let them know which sections they should pay special attention to
# Remain in instant messenger or email contact – needs will be different, suggested activities are:
#* Check in daily, or maintain a presence on instant messenger or chat room, to see how they’re doing
#* Share with them personally – get to know them
#* Look at their recent posts, and give them private feedback or public replies as appropriate.
#* Introduce them to team members that may share interests
#* Continuously coach them on how to improve their moderation skills (constructive feedback – be careful of how you communicate)
#* Verify, through conversation, that they understand the way the team works
#* Verify they understand their role within the team
#* Provide feedback &amp; updates to the team
#* Share the team’s feedback with the apprentice
#* Ask the apprentice if they need help or have new questions (do this often)
#* Identify when the apprentice is ready to become a team member and let the team know

==Development==
===Submitting a Bug===
# Go to the bug tracker, http://dev.simplemachines.org/mantis/
# Click the &quot;Login&quot; link if it appears
# Click on Report Issue
# If you have not selected a project you will be prompted to select one
# Fill out the form, paying special attention to the “Summary” and “Description” The description should give as much details as possible. Include things such as how to reproduce the bug and if using an SVN version version it is. If there is a relevant forum topic (for example, if you are reporting the bug on behalf of a forum member) make sure to link the topic(s) concerning that bug.
# After submitting the bug make sure to review it and make any corrections.

===Reviewing Bugs===
*Review unassigned bugs and assign them to yourself or to the appropriate person. In source Documentation, for example, would be assigned to the doc coordinator. Most bugs can be assigned to the lead developer, who can assign them to other developers.
*After the bug has been fixed in the source and committed repository, open the bug and under the &quot;Change status to&quot; button select &quot;resolved&quot; in the drop down menu and click the button. You'll then be taken to a page where you can add an optional comment. Paste in the changelog message into the comment field and add any other comment you need to make.

===Dealing with Feature Requests===
Community members can use the &quot;Feature Requests&quot; board to post their suggestions and ideas for new standard features. These should be reviewed and any requests that seem good should be brought to the attention of the team for discussion.

==Mundane Administration==
===Updating this Document===
The SMF documentation team is responsible for updating this document. The PM or steering committee may request the documentation team to update this document when required. The documentation team wil complete the work and present the document to the steering committee for approval.
===Forum Administration===
The Project Manager has administrator access to the forum. At least one member each of the site and server teams also have administrator access to the forum. The most efficient way to request routine administrative tasks (badge changes, etc.) is via the &quot;Attention admins&quot; topic on the team boards. Please remember to say please and thank-you.
===Answering General Emails===
There are several general emails at SimpleMachines.org. These include
info@simplemachines.org, security@simplemachines.org, and ???
Members who have been appointed to check emails should have a password, check the emails on a regular, agreed-upon basis.
Once you have taken action on the incoming email, please move it out of the inbox, into an appropriate email folder.
===Press Releases and Official Announcements===
From time to time, the SMF team will need to make a press release or other official announcement. Please
* begin these announcements on an appropriate board, with the tag [WIP]. 
* request help from appropriate team members to make sure the information is correct.
* request the help of doc team members to edit and proofread
* gain the approval of the SimpleMachines marketing team before releasing the announcement.
===Getting Money===
If the SMF team or any part of the SMF team needs to make a purchase or pay for a service, the team will apply for the funds from the NPO.
* First, gain approval from the SMF team steering committee
* Then, apply to the NPO Board of Directors for the funds, or for a change to the yearly budget.

==Legal Issues==
Most legal issues will be dealt with by the NPO. Reports of suspected license infringement may be made to the marketing team.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Privacy and Discretion==
If information is posted on private boards, do not share it with those who do not have access to these boards.
There are two reasons for this:
# Respect the privace of SMF team members, 
# Help the team manage communication with the wider community to avoid misinterpretation.

==Advertising, Licensing, and Acceptable Use==
The SMF team does not handle questions of advertising, licensing, or acceptable use. These issues are handled by the SimpleMachines marketing team. All NPO members should be able to report these issues on the NPO's marketing board.
==Competitors==
Treat our competitors and their products with respect. Do not make fun of them. Do not get caught up in disputes with members of competitors' teams. We don’t have any desire to start up a board war.

There is nothing wrong with finding out more information about our competition. Feel free to install their software and let us know what they have and don’t have. This could provide us with good information on how to change SMF for the better.

==Recommending Service Providers==
Everything you do as a team member of SMF reflects on the credibility of the team. When you recommend an outside service provider, be sure to explain why and be sure to mention any limitations there might be. If you are part of a referral program for that provider, or receive a discount or referral fee from a provider, you must disclose this when you provide a referral.

==Doing SMF-related work for pay==
&quot;Moonlighting&quot; is acceptable. However, you should ALWAYS follow these guidelines. 

*Don’t accept work and accept/expect payment for things that SMF offers as a free service. This would be a conflict of interests and would alienate other members of the team. &lt;br/&gt;Services for which payment can be expected and accepted:
**Creating a modification, 
**Creating a custom theme. 
**Modifying an existing theme.
**Hosting a forum.
**Forum conversions.
*Services for which payment must neither be expected nor be accepted:
**Installing SMF. 
**Upgrading SMF. 
**General support work already offered by the support team and other members. It is not acceptable to post in a general support topic with an &quot;I'll do this if you pay me&quot; response.

If you wish to earn money by performing services that SMF offers, please resign from the team before embarking upon this new business. If you are already earning money by performing services that SMF offers, please decline any invitations to join the team.

*When advertising your services, or responding to a request for paid help, be sure to indicate that your paid services are completely separate from the team support efforts and SMF can accept no liability for any problems that may arise.
*Keep in mind that any work you do will reflect on the team, even when you have given the above disclaimer. So, treat your customer with the highest degree of respect, whether the work is paid or not.
*Providing free help is always preferable. You are a team member, and a volunteer.  This cannot be stressed enough.
*Remember that Charter Members should, where possible, be given a certain amount of preferential treatment. That's what they pay for, after all.

==Accepting Gifts==
Community members sometimes offer gifts as a way of saying “thank you” to a team member. Here are the rules:
* Do not solicit gifts in any way.
* Do not mention that users sometimes provide gifts, or that you have received them in the past
* If someone asks, “How can I thank you?” point them to the SMF Donations page and/or the Charter Members signup page. Because they have not actually offered you a gift, pointing them to a wish list or a personal donation page would be soliciting a gift.
* If someone asks, “May I send you a movie from Amazon as a thank you?” the correct answer is “Thank You”. Congratulations! Typically, this means you have gone above &amp; beyond the call of duty.

Gifts are always nice to get, and we do not want to stand in the way of grateful users offering them to  team members. Similarly, we don’t want to neglect the other team members that assisted you in providing the support behind the scenes. And we do not want to see team members sticking their hands out to ask for a personal gift. That could be crass, and no one wants to be crass, after all.

==Attendance and Activity==
We realize that everyone on the team is a volunteer. We do expect team members to visit the board on a regular, acceptably frequent basis and keep up with team business. You must remain active in whatever team you are on.  It is important for team members to attend team meetings. If you cannot make it, please read the minutes to get caught up.  If you don't have the time for the team right now -- take a break.  Go on hiatus and go &quot;active&quot; again when you are able. If you are going to be much less active for a longer time, you can resign. When you have the time, talk to a team leader about returning.

==General Guidelines==
*Enjoy what you do for SMF... HAVE FUN!
*Remember that you represent SMF and behave accordingly.
*We are friends with all of the other forum packages - especially YaBB and open-source SMF forks.
*Just because something is in another team's child board doesn't mean your input is not important.  Feel free to get involved.
*Everyone should feel free to get involved with the general affairs of SMF. Indeed, this is to be encouraged. But, you should always give due respect to other people's opinions, taking into account their roles and experience.
*Whenever you are planning to be gone long enough for others to notice (and worry), post before you go. 
*Make sure to mention it to others when you're planning a 6 months vacation.
*Try to make the best out of the time you're in the SMF team, as long as it's not at the expense of others.
*Please use full words - saying &quot;pls hlp me - ur da best&quot; will not get you any help.
*No swearing in public (It is offensive to some and not professional).  And please keep it to a minimum in the private boards.
*Always show respect (fake it if necessary) and courtesy to the members of the forum.  They are the community and our customers.
*No fighting or personal attacks.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[C programming language]] offers a function called '''strncasecmp''' that compares the first '''n''' characters of a string with the other irrespective of the case of characters. strncasecmp is found in string.h header file.&lt;br /&gt;

==syntax==

             &lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt; int strncasecmp(const char *f1, const char *f2, size_t n );&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The return value of this function is same as that of strcasecmp i.e it returns 0 if f1 and f2 are equal, a positive integer if f1 is found greater than f2 or a negative integer if f1 is found less than f2.&lt;br /&gt;

==Example==
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
# include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
# include &lt;string.h&gt;
int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
    int i;
    if(argc != 4){
        printf(&quot;bad input\n&quot;);
        return 1;
    }
    i = strncasecmp(argv[1], argv[2], argv[3]);
    if (i == 0)
        printf(&quot;'%s' equals '%s'\n&quot;, argv[1], argv[2]);
    else if (i &gt; 0)
        printf(&quot;'%s' is greater than '%s'\n&quot;, argv[1], argv[2]);
    else if (i &lt; 0)
        printf(&quot;'%s' is less than '%s'\n&quot;, argv[1], argv[2]);
    return 0;
}

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''string.h''' is the header in the [[C standard library]] for the [[C programming language]] which contains [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] definitions, constants, and declarations of functions and types used not only for [[String (computing)|string]] handling but also various memory handling functions; the name is thus something of a misnomer.

Functions declared in &lt;code&gt;string.h&lt;/code&gt; are extremely popular, since as a part of the [[C standard library]], they are guaranteed to work on any platform which supports C.  However, some security issues exist with these functions, such as [[buffer overflow]]s, leading programmers to prefer safer, possibly less portable variants.  Also, the string functions only work with characters encodings made of bytes, such as [[ASCII]] and [[UTF-8]]. In historical documentation the term &quot;character&quot; was often used instead of &quot;byte&quot;, which if followed literally would mean that multi-byte encodings such as [[UTF-8]] were not supported. The BSD documentation has been fixed to make this clear, but POSIX, Linux, and Windows documentation still uses &quot;character&quot; in many places. Functions to handle character encodings made up of larger code units than bytes, such as [[UTF-16]] is generally achieved through &lt;code&gt;[[wchar.h]]&lt;/code&gt;.

'''stdlib.h''' is the header of the '''general purpose standard library''' of [[C programming language]] which includes functions involving memory allocation, process control, conversions and others. It is compatible with [[C++]] and is known as &lt;code&gt;cstdlib&lt;/code&gt; in C++. The name &quot;stdlib&quot; stands for &quot;standard library&quot;.
==Member functions==

Members of the &lt;code&gt;stdlib.h&lt;/code&gt; can be classified into the following categories: conversion, memory, process control, sort and search, mathematics.

|}

==Member constants==
===NULL===
The &lt;code&gt;stdlib.h&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;stddef.h&lt;/code&gt; header files define the macro &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;, which yields a [[null pointer]] constant, and represents a pointer value that is guaranteed not to point to a valid address in memory.

====Variants====
NULL may be defined as a constant expression equal to int zero, long int zero, or zero cast to a void&amp;nbsp;* pointer:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#define NULL  0&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#define NULL  0L&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#define NULL  ((void *) 0)&lt;/source&gt;

Although the [[null pointer]] constant is always represented in C by the symbolic constant 0 or by 0 cast to a void pointer, the actual bit representation of such a pointer is system-specific and may contain one-bits.

==Member data types==
===size_t===
The [[size_t]] definition shall be provided to a referencing piece of code by including this header file. In fact most implementations don't have it defined literally in this file but instead include the file [[stddef.h]] as, for example, the standard library of the GNU C compiler does. The direct inclusion of stddef.h for application code is totally valid and thus can replace stdlib.h in cases where no other members from this file are needed or desired. This whole header file design conforms with e.g. the [[C99]] ISO/ANSI standard definition. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf chapter 7.20&lt;/ref&gt;

===div_t, ldiv_t===
Two less widely used datatypes, &lt;code&gt;div_t&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ldiv_t&lt;/code&gt;, are also defined. They are the return types of the [[div (C)|div and ldiv]] functions. The standard defines them as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
typedef struct {
    int quot, rem;
} div_t;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
typedef struct {
    long int quot, rem;
} ldiv_t;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Nonstandard functions==
===itoa===
[[itoa]] is a common function that is included in many implementations of stdlib.h, but the standard does not define the function. It may have been included because of its appearance in ''[[The C Programming Language (book)|The C Programming Language]]''. Although the same result can be achieved with [[sprintf]], which is defined in the standard, calling itoa directly involves considerably less overhead than calling it (or an equivalent) via sprintf.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''assert.h''' defines the macro &lt;code&gt;assert()&lt;/code&gt;.  The macro can be used to verify assumptions made by the program and print a diagnostic message if this assumption is false.

When executed, if the expression is false (that is, compares equal to 0), &lt;code&gt;assert()&lt;/code&gt; writes information about the  call that failed on &lt;code&gt;stderr&lt;/code&gt; and then calls &lt;code&gt;abort()&lt;/code&gt;.  The information it writes to &lt;code&gt;stderr&lt;/code&gt; includes:
* the source filename (the predefined macro &lt;code&gt;__FILE__&lt;/code&gt;) 
* the source line number (the predefined macro &lt;code&gt;__LINE__&lt;/code&gt;) 
* the source function (the predefined identifier &lt;code&gt;__func__&lt;/code&gt;) (added in C99)
* the text of expression that evaluated to 0

Example output of a program compiled with gcc on Linux:

 program: program.c:5: main: Assertion `a != 1' failed.
 Abort (core dumped)

Programmers can eliminate the assertions without changing the source code:
if the macro NDEBUG is defined before the inclusion of &lt;code&gt;&lt;assert.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;assert()&lt;/code&gt; macro is defined simply as: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#define assert(ignore)((void) 0)
&lt;/source&gt;

and therefore has no effect on the program, not even evaluating its argument. Therefore expressions passed to &lt;code&gt;assert()&lt;/code&gt; must ''not'' contain side-effects since they will not happen when debugging is disabled. For instance:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
assert(x = gets());
&lt;/source&gt;

will not read a line and not assign to x when debugging is disabled.

=Macros=

* [[C Programming/C99 Reference/assert()|assert()]]

=Functions=

The C99 standard requires no functions to be declared in the &lt;code&gt;assert.h&lt;/code&gt; header.

=Notes=

The definition of the &lt;code&gt;[[C Programming/C99 Reference/assert()|assert]]&lt;/code&gt; macro depends on the state of a macro, &lt;code&gt;NDEBUG&lt;/code&gt;, which is ''not'' defined in the &lt;code&gt;assert.h&lt;/code&gt; header.  The macro &lt;code&gt;NDEBUG&lt;/code&gt; denotes not using debugging information.  If &lt;code&gt;NDEBUG&lt;/code&gt; is defined, then  &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; is defined as an expression which does nothing.  Otherwise &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; will print debugging information if the expression it tests is false.

{{lowercase|title=wchar.h}}
{{Wikipedia|template:C Standard library}}
{{Wikipedia|wide character}}
'''wchar.h''' is a [[C++ Programming#.h|header file]] in the [[C Programming/Standard libraries|C standard library]]. It is a part of the extension to the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] standard done in 1995. It contains extended multibyte and wide character utilities. The standard header &lt;wchar.h&gt; is included to perform input and output operations on wide streams. It can also be used to manipulate the wide strings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/6.4.1/dinkum_en/c99/wchar.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wide Characters==
C is a [[programming language]] that was developed in an environment where the dominant character set was the 7-bit [[ASCII]] code. Hence since then the 8-bit byte is the most common unit of encoding. However when a software is developed for an international purpose, it has to be able to represent different characters. For example character encoding schemes to represent the Indian, Chinese, Japanese writing systems should be available. The inconvenience of handling such varied multibyte characters can be eliminated by using characters that are simply a uniform number of bytes. [[ANSI C]] provides a type that allows manipulation of variable width characters as uniform sized data objects called [[wide characters]]. The wide character set is a [[superset]] of already existing character sets, including the 7-bit ASCII.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4Mfe4sAMFUYC&amp;pg=PT26&amp;lpg=PT26&amp;dq=wide+characters+as+superset&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tPLP1nN4qh&amp;sig=f2W0ys85Ms9lRdT4HBEf_yoNL2U&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=H3SMTpiJFpGzrAfzvOycAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Declarations and Definitions==
===Macros===
The standard header wchar.h contains the definitions or declarations of some constants.
:'''NULL'''
:It is a [[Null pointer]] constant. It never points to a real object.
:'''WCHAR_MIN'''
:It indicates the lower limit or the minimum value for the type wchar_t.
:'''WCHAR_MAX'''
:It indicates the upper limit or the maximum value for the type wchar_t.
:'''WEOF'''
:It defines the return value of the type wint_t but the value does not correspond to any member of the extended character set. WEOF indicates the end of a character stream, the end of file([[EOF]]) or an error case.&lt;ref&gt;http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zos/v1r12/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.zos.r12.bpxbd00%2Fwcharh.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data Types===
:'''mbstate_t
:A variable of type mbstate_t contains all the information about the conversion state required from one call to a function to the other.
:'''size_t'''
:It is a size/count type, that stores the result or the returned value of the size of operator.
:'''wchar_t'''
:An object of type wchar_t can hold a wide character. It is also required for declaring or referencing wide characters and wide strings.
:'''wint_t'''
:This type is an integer type that can hold any value corresponding to the members of the extended character set. It can hold all values of the type wchar_t as well as the value of the macro WEOF. This type is unchanged by integral promotions.

{{C Standard library}}

In the programming language [[C (programming language)|C]], '''&lt;code&gt;wctype.h&lt;/code&gt;''' is a [[header file]] in the [[C standard library|standard library]], containing various functions and macros for classifying and mapping [[wide character]]s. The corresponding header for dealing with (normal, non-wide) characters is [[ctype.h|&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ctype.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;]].

This header declares (from [[wchar.h|&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;wchar.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;]]) the &lt;code&gt;wint_t&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wctype_t&lt;/code&gt; types, and &lt;code&gt;WEOF&lt;/code&gt; macro.&lt;ref name=&quot;sus&quot;&gt;{{man|bd|wctype.h|SUS|wide-character classification and mapping utilities}}&lt;/ref&gt; (&lt;code&gt;wint_t&lt;/code&gt; is capable of storing any wide character or the value &lt;code&gt;WEOF&lt;/code&gt;.) The type &lt;code&gt;wctrans_t&lt;/code&gt; is also declared, which represents a mapping between characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;sus&quot; /&gt;

==Character classification functions==
These functions return non-zero/zero depending on whether or not the argument is in a certain category according to the current [[locale]]. [[POSIX|POSIX:2008]] specifies alternate versions of the functions suffixed with &lt;code&gt;_l&lt;/code&gt; which take a locale (&lt;code&gt;locale_t&lt;/code&gt;) as an additional argument.

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Declaration !! Return non-zero if ''ch'' is …
|-
|&lt;code&gt;int {{man|sh|iswalnum|SUS||inline}}(wint_t ''wc'');&lt;/code&gt; || alphanumeric
|-
|&lt;code&gt;int {{man|sh|iswalpha|SUS||inline}}(wint_t ''wc'');&lt;/code&gt; || alphabetic
|-
|&lt;code&gt;int {{man|sh|iswblank|SUS||inline}}(wint_t ''wc'');&lt;/code&gt; || blank
|-
|&lt;code&gt;int {{man|sh|iswcntrl|SUS||inline}}(wint_t ''wc'');&lt;/code&gt; || a [[control character]]
|-
|&lt;code&gt;int {{man|sh|iswctype|SUS||inline}}(wint_t ''wc'', wctype_t ''charclass'');&lt;/code&gt; || in ''charclass''
|-
|&lt;code&gt;int {{man|sh|iswdigit|SUS||inline}}(wint_t ''wc'');&lt;/code&gt; || a decimal [[Numerical digit|digit]]
|-
|&lt;code&gt;int {{man|sh|iswgraph|SUS||inline}}(wint_t ''wc'');&lt;/code&gt; || a [[Graphic character|visible character]]
|-
|&lt;code&gt;int {{man|sh|iswlower|SUS||inline}}(wint_t ''wc'');&lt;/code&gt; || a lowercase letter
|-
|&lt;code&gt;int {{man|sh|iswprint|SUS||inline}}(wint_t ''wc'');&lt;/code&gt; || printable
|-
|&lt;code&gt;int {{man|sh|iswpunct|SUS||inline}}(wint_t ''wc'');&lt;/code&gt; || punctuation
|-
|&lt;code&gt;int {{man|sh|iswspace|SUS||inline}}(wint_t ''wc'');&lt;/code&gt; || [[Whitespace character|white-space]]
|-
|&lt;code&gt;int {{man|sh|iswupper|SUS||inline}}(wint_t ''wc'');&lt;/code&gt; || an uppercase letter
|-
|&lt;code&gt;int {{man|sh|iswxdigit|SUS||inline}}(wint_t ''wc'');&lt;/code&gt; || a [[hexadecimal]] digit
|}

==Character mapping functions==
These functions take a wide character, and apply some mapping to it.

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Declaration !! Description
|-
|&lt;code&gt;wint_t {{man|sh|towctrans|SUS||inline}}(wint_t ''ch'', wctrans_t ''desc'');&lt;/code&gt; || Map ''ch'' according to the mapping ''desc''
|-
|&lt;code&gt;wint_t {{man|sh|towlower|SUS||inline}}(wint_t ''ch'');&lt;/code&gt; || If ''ch'' is an uppercase letter, map it to lowercase, otherwise return it unchanged
|-
|&lt;code&gt;wint_t {{man|sh|towupper|SUS||inline}}(wint_t ''ch'');&lt;/code&gt; || If ''ch'' is a lowercase letter, map it to uppercase, otherwise return it unchanged
|}

==Other functions==
These functions create values for use with other functions, from a string. Note that &lt;code&gt;iswdigit(''c'')&lt;/code&gt; is the same as &lt;code&gt;iswctype(''c'', wctype(&quot;digit&quot;))&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;toupper(''c'')&lt;/code&gt; is the same as &lt;code&gt;towctrans(''c'', wctrans(&quot;toupper&quot;))&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n1256.pdf The current Standard (C99 with Technical corrigenda TC1, TC2, and TC3 included)]|3.61&amp;nbsp;MB}}. Pages 397, 398 and 400.&lt;/ref&gt;

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Declaration !! Description
|-
|&lt;code&gt;wctrans_t {{man|sh|wctrans|SUS||inline}}(const char *''charclass'');&lt;/code&gt; || Returns a character mapping which can be used with &lt;code&gt;towctrans&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;wctype_t {{man|sh|wctype|SUS||inline}}(const char *''property'');&lt;/code&gt; || Returns a character class which can be used with &lt;code&gt;iswctype&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;
いよいよ学校へ出た。初めて教場へはいって高い所へ乗った時は、何だか変だった。講釈をしながら、おれでも先生が勤まるのかと思った。生徒はやかましい。時々図抜（ずぬ）けた大きな声で先生と云（い）う。先生には応（こた）えた。今まで物理学校で毎日先生先生と呼びつけていたが、先生と呼ぶのと、呼ばれるのは雲泥（うんでい）の差だ。何だか足の裏がむずむずする。おれは卑怯（ひきょう）な人間ではない。臆病（おくびょう）な男でもないが、惜（お）しい事に胆力（たんりょく）が欠けている。先生と大きな声をされると、腹の減った時に丸の内で午砲（どん）を聞いたような気がする。最初の一時間は何だかいい加減にやってしまった。しかし別段困った質問も掛（か）けられずに済んだ。控所（ひかえじょ）へ帰って来たら、山嵐がどうだいと聞いた。うんと単簡に返事をしたら山嵐は安心したらしかった。


　二時間目に白墨（はくぼく）を持って控所を出た時には何だか敵地へ乗り込（こ）むような気がした。教場へ出ると今度の組は前より大きな奴（やつ）ばかりである。おれは江戸（えど）っ子で華奢（きゃしゃ）に小作りに出来ているから、どうも高い所へ上がっても押（お）しが利かない。喧嘩（けんか）なら相撲取（すもうとり）とでもやってみせるが、こんな大僧（おおぞう）を四十人も前へ並（なら）べて、ただ一枚（まい）の舌をたたいて恐縮（きょうしゅく）させる手際はない。しかしこんな田舎者（いなかもの）に弱身を見せると癖（くせ）になると思ったから、なるべく大きな声をして、少々巻き舌で講釈してやった。最初のうちは、生徒も烟（けむ）に捲（ま）かれてぼんやりしていたから、それ見ろとますます得意になって、べらんめい調を用いてたら、一番前の列の真中（まんなか）に居た、一番強そうな奴が、いきなり起立して先生と云う。そら来たと思いながら、何だと聞いたら、「あまり早くて分からんけれ、もちっと、ゆるゆる遣（や）って、おくれんかな、もし」と云った。おくれんかな、もしは生温（なまぬ）るい言葉だ。早過ぎるなら、ゆっくり云ってやるが、おれは江戸っ子だから君等（きみら）の言葉は使えない、分（わか）らなければ、分るまで待ってるがいいと答えてやった。この調子で二時間目は思ったより、うまく行った。ただ帰りがけに生徒の一人がちょっとこの問題を解釈をしておくれんかな、もし、と出来そうもない幾何（きか）の問題を持って逼（せま）ったには冷汗（ひやあせ）を流した。仕方がないから何だか分らない、この次教えてやると急いで引き揚（あ）げたら、生徒がわあと囃（はや）した。その中に出来ん出来んと云う声が聞（きこ）える。箆棒（べらぼう）め、先生だって、出来ないのは当り前だ。出来ないのを出来ないと云うのに不思議があるもんか。そんなものが出来るくらいなら四十円でこんな田舎へくるもんかと控所へ帰って来た。今度はどうだとまた山嵐が聞いた。うんと云ったが、うんだけでは気が済まなかったから、この学校の生徒は分らずやだなと云ってやった。山嵐は妙（みょう）な顔をしていた。


　三時間目も、四時間目も昼過ぎの一時間も大同小異であった。最初の日に出た級は、いずれも少々ずつ失敗した。教師ははたで見るほど楽じゃないと思った。授業はひと通り済んだが、まだ帰れない、三時までぽつ然（ねん）として待ってなくてはならん。三時になると、受持級の生徒が自分の教室を掃除（そうじ）して報知（しらせ）にくるから検分をするんだそうだ。それから、出席簿（しゅっせきぼ）を一応調べてようやくお暇（ひま）が出る。いくら月給で買われた身体（からだ）だって、あいた時間まで学校へ縛（しば）りつけて机と睨（にら）めっくらをさせるなんて法があるものか。しかしほかの連中はみんな大人（おとな）しくご規則通りやってるから新参のおればかり、だだを捏（こ）ねるのもよろしくないと思って我慢（がまん）していた。帰りがけに、君何でもかんでも三時過（すぎ）まで学校にいさせるのは愚（おろか）だぜと山嵐に訴えたら、山嵐はそうさアハハハと笑ったが、あとから真面目（まじめ）になって、君あまり学校の不平を云うと、いかんぜ。云うなら僕（ぼく）だけに話せ、随分（ずいぶん）妙な人も居るからなと忠告がましい事を云った。四つ角で分れたから詳（くわ）しい事は聞くひまがなかった。


　それからうちへ帰ってくると、宿の亭主（ていしゅ）がお茶を入れましょうと云ってやって来る。お茶を入れると云うからご馳走（ちそう）をするのかと思うと、おれの茶を遠慮（えんりょ）なく入れて自分が飲むのだ。この様子では留守中（るすちゅう）も勝手にお茶を入れましょうを一人（ひとり）で履行（りこう）しているかも知れない。亭主が云うには手前は書画骨董（しょがこっとう）がすきで、とうとうこんな商買を内々で始めるようになりました。あなたもお見受け申すところ大分ご風流でいらっしゃるらしい。ちと道楽にお始めなすってはいかがですと、飛んでもない勧誘（かんゆう）をやる。二年前ある人の使（つかい）に帝国（ていこく）ホテルへ行った時は錠前（じょうまえ）直しと間違（まちが）えられた事がある。ケットを被（かぶ）って、鎌倉（かまくら）の大仏を見物した時は車屋から親方と云われた。その外今日（こんにち）まで見損（みそくな）われた事は随分あるが、まだおれをつらまえて大分ご風流でいらっしゃると云ったものはない。大抵（たいてい）はなりや様子でも分る。風流人なんていうものは、画（え）を見ても、頭巾（ずきん）を被（かぶ）るか短冊（たんざく）を持ってるものだ。このおれを風流人だなどと真面目に云うのはただの曲者（くせもの）じゃない。おれはそんな呑気（のんき）な隠居（いんきょ）のやるような事は嫌（きら）いだと云ったら、亭主はへへへへと笑いながら、いえ始めから好きなものは、どなたもございませんが、いったんこの道にはいるとなかなか出られませんと一人で茶を注いで妙な手付（てつき）をして飲んでいる。実はゆうべ茶を買ってくれと頼（たの）んでおいたのだが、こんな苦い濃（こ）い茶はいやだ。一杯（ぱい）飲むと胃に答えるような気がする。今度からもっと苦くないのを買ってくれと云ったら、かしこまりましたとまた一杯しぼって飲んだ。人の茶だと思って無暗（むやみ）に飲む奴（やつ）だ。主人が引き下がってから、明日の下読（したよみ）をしてすぐ寝（ね）てしまった。


　それから毎日毎日学校へ出ては規則通り働く、毎日毎日帰って来ると主人がお茶を入れましょうと出てくる。一週間ばかりしたら学校の様子もひと通りは飲み込めたし、宿の夫婦の人物も大概（たいがい）は分った。ほかの教師に聞いてみると辞令を受けて一週間から一ヶ月ぐらいの間は自分の評判がいいだろうか、悪（わ）るいだろうか非常に気に掛（か）かるそうであるが、おれは一向そんな感じはなかった。教場で折々しくじるとその時だけはやな心持ちだが三十分ばかり立つと奇麗（きれい）に消えてしまう。おれは何事によらず長く心配しようと思っても心配が出来ない男だ。教場のしくじりが生徒にどんな影響（えいきょう）を与（あた）えて、その影響が校長や教頭にどんな反応を呈（てい）するかまるで無頓着（むとんじゃく）であった。おれは前に云う通りあまり度胸の据（すわ）った男ではないのだが、思い切りはすこぶるいい人間である。この学校がいけなければすぐどっかへ行（ゆ）く覚悟（かくご）でいたから、狸（たぬき）も赤シャツも、ちっとも恐（おそろ）しくはなかった。まして教場の小僧（こぞう）共なんかには愛嬌（あいきょう）もお世辞も使う気になれなかった。学校はそれでいいのだが下宿の方はそうはいかなかった。亭主が茶を飲みに来るだけなら我慢もするが、いろいろな者を持ってくる。始めに持って来たのは何でも印材で、十（とお）ばかり並（なら）べておいて、みんなで三円なら安い物だお買いなさいと云う。田舎巡（いなかまわ）りのヘボ絵師じゃあるまいし、そんなものは入らないと云ったら、今度は華山（かざん）とか何とか云う男の花鳥の掛物（かけもの）をもって来た。自分で床（とこ）の間（ま）へかけて、いい出来じゃありませんかと云うから、そうかなと好加減（いいかげん）に挨拶（あいさつ）をすると、華山には二人（ふたり）ある、一人は何とか華山で、一人は何とか華山ですが、この幅（ふく）はその何とか華山の方だと、くだらない講釈をしたあとで、どうです、あなたなら十五円にしておきます。お買いなさいと催促（さいそく）をする。金がないと断わると、金なんか、いつでもようございますとなかなか頑固（がんこ）だ。金があつても買わないんだと、その時は追っ払（ぱら）っちまった。その次には鬼瓦（おにがわら）ぐらいな大硯（おおすずり）を担ぎ込んだ。これは端渓（たんけい）です、端渓ですと二遍（へん）も三遍も端渓がるから、面白半分に端渓た何だいと聞いたら、すぐ講釈を始め出した。端渓には上層中層下層とあって、今時のものはみんな上層ですが、これはたしかに中層です、この眼（がん）をご覧なさい。眼が三つあるのは珍（めず）らしい。溌墨（はつぼく）の具合も至極よろしい、試してご覧なさいと、おれの前へ大きな硯を突（つ）きつける。いくらだと聞くと、持主が支那（しな）から持って帰って来て是非売りたいと云いますから、お安くして三十円にしておきましょうと云う。この男は馬鹿（ばか）に相違（そうい）ない。学校の方はどうかこうか無事に勤まりそうだが、こう骨董責（こっとうぜめ）に逢（あ）ってはとても長く続きそうにない。


　そのうち学校もいやになった。　　ある日の晩大町（おおまち）と云う所を散歩していたら郵便局の隣（とな）りに蕎麦（そば）とかいて、下に東京と注を加えた看板があった。おれは蕎麦が大好きである。東京に居（お）った時でも蕎麦屋の前を通って薬味の香（にお）いをかぐと、どうしても暖簾（のれん）がくぐりたくなった。今日までは数学と骨董で蕎麦を忘れていたが、こうして看板を見ると素通りが出来なくなる。ついでだから一杯食って行こうと思って上がり込んだ。見ると看板ほどでもない。東京と断（こと）わる以上はもう少し奇麗にしそうなものだが、東京を知らないのか、金がないのか、滅法（めっぽう）きたない。畳（たたみ）は色が変ってお負けに砂でざらざらしている。壁（かべ）は煤（すす）で真黒（まっくろ）だ。天井（てんじょう）はランプの油烟（ゆえん）で燻（くす）ぼってるのみか、低くって、思わず首を縮めるくらいだ。ただ麗々と蕎麦の名前をかいて張り付けたねだん付けだけは全く新しい。何でも古いうちを買って二三日（にさんち）前から開業したに違（ちが）いなかろう。ねだん付の第一号に天麩羅（てんぷら）とある。おい天麩羅を持ってこいと大きな声を出した。するとこの時まで隅（すみ）の方に三人かたまって、何かつるつる、ちゅうちゅう食ってた連中（れんじゅう）が、ひとしくおれの方を見た。部屋（へや）が暗いので、ちょっと気がつかなかったが顔を合せると、みんな学校の生徒である。先方で挨拶（あいさつ）をしたから、おれも挨拶をした。その晩は久（ひさ）し振（ぶり）に蕎麦を食ったので、旨（うま）かったから天麩羅を四杯平（たいら）げた。


　翌日何の気もなく教場へはいると、黒板一杯ぐらいな大きな字で、天麩羅先生とかいてある。おれの顔を見てみんなわあと笑った。おれは馬鹿馬鹿しいから、天麩羅を食っちゃ可笑（おか）しいかと聞いた。すると生徒の一人（ひとり）が、しかし四杯は過ぎるぞな、もし、と云った。四杯食おうが五杯食おうがおれの銭でおれが食うのに文句があるもんかと、さっさと講義を済まして控所へ帰って来た。十分立って次の教場へ出ると一つ天麩羅四杯なり。但（ただ）し笑うべからず。と黒板にかいてある。さっきは別に腹も立たなかったが今度は癪（しゃく）に障（さわ）った。冗談（じょうだん）も度を過ごせばいたずらだ。焼餅（やきもち）の黒焦（くろこげ）のようなもので誰（だれ）も賞（ほ）め手はない。田舎者はこの呼吸が分からないからどこまで押（お）して行っても構わないと云う了見（りょうけん）だろう。一時間あるくと見物する町もないような狭（せま）い都に住んで、外に何にも芸がないから、天麩羅事件を日露（にちろ）戦争のように触（ふ）れちらかすんだろう。憐（あわ）れな奴等（やつら）だ。小供の時から、こんなに教育されるから、いやにひねっこびた、植木鉢（うえきばち）の楓（かえで）みたような小人（しょうじん）が出来るんだ。無邪気（むじゃき）ならいっしょに笑ってもいいが、こりゃなんだ。小供の癖（くせ）に乙（おつ）に毒気を持ってる。おれはだまって、天麩羅を消して、こんないたずらが面白いか、卑怯（ひきょう）な冗談だ。君等は卑怯と云う意味を知ってるか、と云ったら、自分がした事を笑われて怒（おこ）るのが卑怯じゃろうがな、もしと答えた奴がある。やな奴だ。わざわざ東京から、こんな奴を教えに来たのかと思ったら情なくなった。余計な減らず口を利かないで勉強しろと云って、授業を始めてしまった。それから次の教場へ出たら天麩羅を食うと減らず口が利きたくなるものなりと書いてある。どうも始末に終えない。あんまり腹が立ったから、そんな生意気な奴は教えないと云ってすたすた帰って来てやった。生徒は休みになって喜んだそうだ。こうなると学校より骨董の方がまだましだ。


　天麩羅蕎麦もうちへ帰って、一晩寝たらそんなに肝癪（かんしゃく）に障らなくなった。学校へ出てみると、生徒も出ている。何だか訳が分らない。それから三日ばかりは無事であったが、四日目の晩に住田（すみた）と云う所へ行って団子（だんご）を食った。この住田と云う所は温泉のある町で城下から汽車だと十分ばかり、歩いて三十分で行かれる、料理屋も温泉宿も、公園もある上に遊廓（ゆうかく）がある。おれのはいった団子屋は遊廓の入口にあって、大変うまいという評判だから、温泉に行った帰りがけにちょっと食ってみた。今度は生徒にも逢わなかったから、誰（だれ）も知るまいと思って、翌日学校へ行って、一時間目の教場へはいると団子二皿（さら）七銭と書いてある。実際おれは二皿食って七銭払（はら）った。どうも厄介（やっかい）な奴等だ。二時間目にもきっと何かあると思うと遊廓の団子旨い旨いと書いてある。あきれ返った奴等だ。団子がそれで済んだと思ったら今度は赤手拭（あかてぬぐい）と云うのが評判になった。何の事だと思ったら、つまらない来歴だ。おれはここへ来てから、毎日住田の温泉へ行く事に極（き）めている。ほかの所は何を見ても東京の足元にも及（およ）ばないが温泉だけは立派なものだ。せっかく来た者だから毎日はいってやろうという気で、晩飯前に運動かたがた出掛（でかけ）る。ところが行くときは必ず西洋手拭の大きな奴をぶら下げて行く。この手拭が湯に染（そま）った上へ、赤い縞（しま）が流れ出したのでちょっと見ると紅色（べにいろ）に見える。おれはこの手拭を行きも帰りも、汽車に乗ってもあるいても、常にぶら下げている。それで生徒がおれの事を赤手拭赤手拭と云うんだそうだ。どうも狭い土地に住んでるとうるさいものだ。まだある。温泉は三階の新築で上等は浴衣（ゆかた）をかして、流しをつけて八銭で済む。その上に女が天目（てんもく）へ茶を載（の）せて出す。おれはいつでも上等へはいった。すると四十円の月給で毎日上等へはいるのは贅沢（ぜいたく）だと云い出した。余計なお世話だ。まだある。湯壺（ゆつぼ）は花崗石（みかげいし）を畳（たた）み上げて、十五畳敷（じょうじき）ぐらいの広さに仕切ってある。大抵（たいてい）は十三四人漬（つか）ってるがたまには誰も居ない事がある。深さは立って乳の辺まであるから、運動のために、湯の中を泳ぐのはなかなか愉快（ゆかい）だ。おれは人の居ないのを見済（みすま）しては十五畳の湯壺を泳ぎ巡（まわ）って喜んでいた。ところがある日三階から威勢（いせい）よく下りて今日も泳げるかなとざくろ口を覗（のぞ）いてみると、大きな札へ黒々と湯の中で泳ぐべからずとかいて貼（は）りつけてある。湯の中で泳ぐものは、あまりあるまいから、この貼札（はりふだ）はおれのために特別に新調したのかも知れない。おれはそれから泳ぐのは断念した。泳ぐのは断念したが、学校へ出てみると、例の通り黒板に湯の中で泳ぐべからずと書いてあるには驚（おど）ろいた。何だか生徒全体がおれ一人を探偵（たんてい）しているように思われた。くさくさした。生徒が何を云ったって、やろうと思った事をやめるようなおれではないが、何でこんな狭苦しい鼻の先がつかえるような所へ来たのかと思うと情なくなった。それでうちへ帰ると相変らず骨董責である。

VM- Thanks to Darren I was able to upload the picture of textbooks. (120112)

Kevin McGuire: I love iTunes U and the iPad app available for it! So many great courses and ways for personal professional development.

I was not aware of iTunes U. I found this information to be interesting and informative. I know that I want to look into this further because of what it can provide for personal development. Ryan L.

Very informative! I wish I had this in my under grad days to go back an access lectures and notes. Like Kevin said, I have so many different ideas of how I could use this! - Jared K

I didn't know that iTunesU supported so many file formats and/or that museums and libraries were active members on the &quot;Beyond Campus&quot; spot.  Thanks for the information! - Heather

Great job on the creation of your page. You really had a lot of great content and explained how this useful tool can be integrated into the classroom. -Anthony

== additional contributions ==

I added the introductory paragraph that explained more about what iTunes U is.  Added picture of an iPad.  I also added two new references to the bottom of the page.  (Paul Z)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;code&gt;errno.h&lt;/code&gt; defines macros to report error conditions through error codes stored in a static location called &lt;code&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt;.

A value is stored in &lt;code&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt; by certain library functions when they detect errors. At program startup, the value stored is zero. Library functions store only values greater than zero. Any library function can alter the value stored before return, whether or not they detect errors. Most functions indicate that they detected an error by returning a special value, typically NULL for functions that return pointers, and -1 for functions that return integers. A few functions require the caller to preset &lt;code&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt; to zero and test it afterwards to see if an error was detected.

The &lt;code&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt; macro expands to an lvalue with type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, containing the last error code generated in any function using the errno facility. Originally this was a static memory location, but macros are almost always used today to allow for multi-threading, each thread will see its own error number.

The header file also defines macros that expand to integer constants that represent the error codes. The C standard only requires three to be defined:

'''EDOM'''
:Results from a parameter outside a function's domain, for example &lt;code&gt;sqrt(-1)&lt;/code&gt;

'''ERANGE'''
:Results from a result outside a function's range, for example &lt;code&gt;strtol(&quot;0xfffffffff&quot;,NULL,0)&lt;/code&gt;

'''EILSEQ'''
:Results from an illegal byte sequence, for example &lt;code&gt;mbstowcs(buf,&quot;\xff&quot;, 1)&lt;/code&gt; (if the multi-byte encoding is UTF-8).

POSIX compliant operating systems like UNIX or Linux include many other error values, many of which are used much more often than the above ones, such as '''EACCES''' for when a file cannot be opened for reading.

      <comment>/* Functions from math.h http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009604599/basedefs/tgmath.h.html */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''tgmath.h''' is a [[C Programming/Standard libraries|Standard C]] header that defines many type-generic [[C Programming/Preprocessor#macros|macros]] that can be used for a variety of mathematical operations. This header also includes &lt;code&gt;[[C Programming/C Reference/math.h|math.h]]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[[C Programming/C Reference/complex.h|complex.h]]&lt;/code&gt;. For all of the functions in the &lt;code&gt;math.h&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;complex.h&lt;/code&gt; headers that do not have an f ([[C Programming/Types|float]]) or l ([[C++ Programming#Modifiers|long double]]) suffix, and whose corresponding type is [[C++ Programming#Modifiers|double]] (with the exception of &lt;code&gt;modf()&lt;/code&gt;), there is a corresponding macro.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/tgmath.h.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Type-generic macro ==
A type generic macro is something which allows calling a [[C++ Programming/Code/Statements/Functions|function]] whose type is determined by the type of argument in the macro. This means, for example, x is declared as an [[C Programming/Reference Tables#Table of Data Types|int]] data type but &lt;math&gt;tan&lt;/math&gt; has been called this way:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt; tan((float)x)&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
then this expression will have a type &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man7/tgmath.h.7posix.html&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Also, if any one of the [[C++ Programming/Code/Statements/Functions#Parameters and arguments|parameters]] or [[C++ Programming/Code/Statements/Functions#Parameters and arguments|arguments]] of a type-generic macro is complex, it will call a complex function, otherwise a real function will be called. The type of function that is called, ultimately depends upon the final converted type of parameter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/6.4.1/dinkum_en/c99/tgmath.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Dependency Graph ==
The flowchart below shows the Dependency graph for tgmath.h.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-zeuthen.desy.de/apewww/APE/software/nlibc/html/tgmath_8h.html&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dependency Graph for tgmath.h.png|center|400px|thumb|Dependency Graph]]

== Functions from &lt;code&gt;math.h&lt;/code&gt;==
The functions listed below handle real arguments and returns real output only. If complex arguments are passed to these functions, NaN or other special numbers are returned&lt;ref name = &quot;pubs&quot;&gt; http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009604599/basedefs/tgmath.h.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Usage example ==
The code below illustrates usage of ,&lt;code&gt;atan&lt;/code&gt; function defined in &lt;code&gt;tgmath.h&lt;/code&gt;, which computes the [[Trigonometry/Inverse Trigonometric Functions|inverse of tangent]] of a number defined in the [[Calculus/Functions#Domain|domain]] of [[Geometry/Circles/Tangents and Secants|tangent]]. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;tgmath.h&gt;
int main()
{
        float ang, ans;
        scanf(&quot;%f&quot;, &amp;ang);
        ans = atan(ang);
        printf(&quot;%0.3f\n&quot;, ans);
        return 0;
}&lt;/source&gt;

== Notable differences ==
The similar functions defined here have notable difference when it comes to return value of &quot;tricky&quot; numbers. For example, using sqrt to compute [[Algebra/Roots and Radicals#Square root|square root]] of -25 returns '''-NaN'''(Not a Number), whereas, csqrt returns 0.000000. Such differences may be noticed in other functions also.

== Rationale ==
This header file is mainly included while calculating mathematical functions.As it includes both [[C Programming/C Reference/math.h|math.h]] and [[C Programming/C Reference/complex.h|complex.h]], the problem arising due to inconsistent input is solved. Including any of the header files, individually, involves inconsistent outputs for some inputs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many different types of roles that add to the mixture of Simple Machines, and they all
must work together for this organization to thrive. This section highlights the different roles you
are likely to encounter, and how they fit into the overall picture of Simple Machines.
==NPO Members==
All members of the SMF team, once they are accepted by the NPO board of directors, are NPO members. In addition, the NPO has service teams, including the site, server, and marketing teams. In the future, other software development projects may join the NPO, and their members may become NPO members. Some NPO members do not belong to any of the NPO's service or project teams.

All regular members of the NPO must pay annual dues, or, in lieu of dues, perform volunteer service for the NPO or its teams. All regular members may vote in the annual elections, and in any other polls the NPO may conduct. 

If NPO members leave teams, cease performing volunteer service, and/or cease paying dues, they will become emeritus members. These emeritus members may participate in discussions, but may not vote.

The NPO bylaws stipulate that the ratio of non-team members to team members of the NPO must not exceed 30%. If the ratio ever exceeds 30%, or if the addition of a non-team member would cause the ratio by 30%, no non-team members may be added until such time as adding a non-team member would not cause this ratio to exceed 30%.

==NPO Board of Directors==
The members of the NPO board of directors are elected to 2-year terms. Elections for approximately half of the seats are held every year, in June, by a vote of all voting members of the NPO. Once the board has been elected, they decide among themselves who will fulfill the roles of President, Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer. The Board of Directors is responsible for making sure that the NPO's bills are paid and other obligations are satisfied. The Board of Directors may, from time to time, appoint members to carry out some of the duties of the NPO.

==Simple Machines LLC==
From October 23rd 2006 until 2011, Simple Machines was a Limited Liability Company registered in the state of Arizona. During 2010 and 2011, the Simple Machines NPO took on the responsibilities of the LLC, and in 2011, the LLC completed a merge with the NPO and was dissolved. The Simple Machines NPO has taken on all of the LLC's assets, liabilities, and business responsibilities. The Simple Machines LLC no longer exists. Some members of the Simple Machines LLC have become members of the Simple Machines NPO.

==SMF Team Members==

{{User:AngelinaBelle/template/Did you know
|text=The book of Unknown is a tome of priceless information that is passed on to only the most worthy and inquisitive team members.
Seek and you will find.}}&lt;!--

--&gt;
The people behind the Simple Machines Forum are a diverse group of individuals who, in their free time, combine their effort to help make Simple Machines Forum what it is today. Each team member is a volunteer who has agreed to donate their time and efforts to help improve Simple Machines’ products and services. Team members have different skills, and work on different parts of the project.

This project was founded by and for people looking to develop their skills as well as themselves, and this is reflected in the team's core values. As a team, we need to support all team members, and foster adherence to these core values as we help and encourage others and provide opportunities for growth, development and learning.

The SMF team is divided into several smaller teams, each responsible for a different area of the project’s success. This means that each position is a crucial one. Team members should be encouraged to stretch themselves and to try new things and push the team boundaries. Switching teams from time to time is an excellent way for members to learn new skills, apply old skills to new tasks, and provide variety to everyone. As we develop our team members, the whole team will benefit, as we increase the experience of our entire team.

==SMF Friends==
Anyone who had a lot of influence in the early years of the project (E.g. Zef Hemel), or any former team member is listed as a friend of SMF. These individuals have a lot of knowledge about the history of SMF, and many of them know a lot about the code. Many of them check in from time to time on the Friends board, and are available and interested in providing experience, knowledge and advice. Some friends have left in order to take on new challenges. Others have left the team because of a lack of time, and may return to the team in the future.

==Forum Users==
The users of SMF are the most varied group of people at simplemachines.org. They are the reason the public simplemachines.org forum was established -- to support them. Some users are very knowledgeable, while others are struggling to learn to use SMF. Some communicate clearly, while others are difficult to understand. Some users appreciate the work we do, while others don't seem to understand. Some are easy to interact with, while others are not. As team members, we will treat all of them with patience, respect and fairness, friendliness, and civility, in accordance with our core values.

Always keep an eye out for forum users who are a good match for the team's core values, and have shown skill for developing, supporting, or documenting the SMF software -- most of the Simple Machines team members began their involvement as forum users on simplemachines.org.

==Charter Members==
Charter Members have signed up for an annual subscription. They have demonstrated that they believe in our success enough to make a financial contribution. The money they contribute is important to the financial health of the project. Charter members have a private section on the community forums, and are given a higher priority for support, via the HelpDesk system.

Charter Members are our primary advocates outside of SMF circles. So giving them good support is important to our continued success.
Many of our charter members are competent installers and programmers. The vast majority of them are website owners who understand that they don’t have the skills to built their site, and who appreciate our technical expertise and our experience with the software. They are a great source of support, and a great source of honest feedback.

==Advertisers==
Most advertisers on the SMF site are owners of hosting companies or software companies who
advertise to web masters and website owners. If you come across an advertiser using our
community, please be considerate and helpful – if we can help their business grow, then they will
be able to afford more advertising in the future.

If you ever elect to use an advertiser’s products or services, please take the time to provide them
with a testimonial and a comment to let them know that their contributions to SMF yielded them
new business, and to help them understand we appreciate their patronage.

The NPO's marketing team handles all requests from advertisers.

==Competitors==
There should be friendly competition between us and the developers of other forum software. We should all be able to learn from the good points of other team's designs and implementation. And we should be able to keep the conversation productive and civil, even on private boards. Assume that whatever you say about a competitor will get out, eventually. 

With the new license adopted for SMF 2.0, we have a new kind of competition -- forks of SMF. These modified versions of the Simple Machines forum are written by developers who are looking for a challenge, or who want to try taking the SMF code in a direction different from what the team has chosen. Discussions of pros and cons of these choices and implementations could grow heated, but should remain civil and friendly. Some of the best SMF talent will choose to do some work on a fork at some point, and the team can often learn from the experiments of fork authors.

==Redistributors==
Anyone is permitted to redistribute SMF 2.0, as long as they follow the licensing agreement. Any requests for interpretation of the license agreement should be directed to the NPO.

Anyone who wishes to distribute earlier versions of SMF must have written permission from the SimpleMachines NPO. All inquiries about redistributing earlier versions of SMF should be directed to the NPO.

==Bots/Crawlers==
Bots and Crawlers are not, strictly speaking, people. Most of them are automated indexers employed by search engine companies. Search engines are a benefit to the Simple Machines community. They draw interested users to the site, and help them find answers to their questions.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''math.h''' is a header file in the [[C standard library|standard library]] of the [[C programming language]] designed for basic mathematical operations. Most of the functions involve the use of [[floating point]] numbers. [[C++]] also implements these functions for compatibility reasons and declares them in the header &lt;code&gt;cmath&lt;/code&gt; (the C99 functions are not available in the current C++ standard, C++ 98).

All functions that take or return an angle work in [[radians]].

All functions take &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;s for floating-point arguments, unless otherwise specified. In C99, to work with &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;s or &lt;code&gt;long double&lt;/code&gt;s, append an &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; or an &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; to the name, respectively.

Mathematical library functions that operate on integers, such as &lt;code&gt;abs&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;labs&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;ldiv&lt;/code&gt;, are instead specified in the [[stdlib.h]] header.

All values are of type double. As an extension, the GNU C library also defines these constants with type long double. The long double macros have a lowercase ‘l’ appended to their names: M_El, M_PIl, and so forth. These are only available if _GNU_SOURCE is defined.

Note: Some programs use a constant named PI which has the same value as M_PI. This constant is not standard; it may have appeared in some old AT&amp;T headers, and is mentioned in Stroustrup's book on C++. It infringes on the user's name space, so the GNU C library does not define it. Fixing programs written to expect it is simple: replace PI with M_PI throughout, or put ‘-DPI=M_PI’ on the compiler command line.

While these constants are common, they are not part of the C standard, so most modern compilers require an explicit definition (such as _USE_MATH_DEFINES in Microsoft Visual C++ &lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4hwaceh6.aspx Math Constants], MSDN.&lt;/ref&gt;) for them to be defined when including math.h.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''stddef.h''' is a [[header file]] in the [[standard library]] of the [[C programming language]] that defines the [[macros]] [[NULL]] and [[offsetof]] as well as the types [[ptrdiff_t]], [[wchar_t]], and [[size_t]]&lt;ref&gt;http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/stddef.h.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Inclusion ==
In C, one includes the [[header file]] &quot;stddef.h&quot;, in this way:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

In C++, one includes the [[header file]] &quot;cstddef&quot;, in this way:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstddef&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Namespace ==
The [[header file]] &quot;stddef.h&quot; places its definitions in the global scope; the [[header file]] &quot;cstddef&quot; places &lt;code&gt;[[size_t]]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[[ptrdiff_t]]&lt;/code&gt; in [[namespace]] &lt;code&gt;std&lt;/code&gt;.

== NULL ==
{{main|Null pointer}}
A macro that expands to a null pointer constant.
It may be defined as ((void*)0), 0 or 0L depending on the compiler and the language.

== offsetof(type, member) ==

{{main|offsetof|l1=offsetof}}
A functional macro that is used to determine the byte offset of the indicated member field in the specified structure type.

== Type size_t ==

{{main|size_t}}
The type [[size_t]] represents the appropriate type for representing the size of objects of memory areas, and for use in dereferencing the elements of an array. It has an implementation-dependent size; usually but not necessarily, it has a 32-bit representation on 32-bit systems and a 64-bit representation on 64-bit systems. It is [[unsigned]].

This type has in some implementations a signed variant with name [[ssize_t]], that is defined in the [[UNIX]] [[header file]] &quot;[[unistd.h]]&quot;. For GNU C the type ssize_t is defined in &quot;stddef.h&quot; and thus resides in the same file as size_t.

== Type wchar_t ==

{{main|wchar_t}}
An implementation-specific &quot;wide character&quot; type, which is predefined in the [[C++ programming language]] but requires the header &quot;stddef.h&quot; or &quot;wchar.h&quot; in the [[C programming language]].

== Type ptrdiff_t ==

{{main|Pointer (computing)#C and C++}}
The type ptrdiff_t is a type that can hold the result of subtracting two pointers. The underlying type of ptrdiff_t varies from implementation to implementation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{dewikify}}
The [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] provides many [[standard library]] [[subroutine|functions]] for [[computer file|file]] [[input/output|input and output]]. These functions make up the bulk of the [[C standard library]] [[header file|header]] &lt;code&gt;&lt;[[stdio.h]]&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

The I/O functionality of C is fairly low-level by modern standards; C abstracts all file operations into operations on [[stream (computing)|stream]]s of [[byte]]s, which may be &quot;input streams&quot; or &quot;output streams&quot;. Unlike some earlier programming languages, C has no direct support for [[random-access]] data files; to read from a record in the middle of a file, the programmer must create a stream, [[fseek|seek]] to the middle of the file, and then read bytes in sequence from the stream.

The stream model of file I/O was popularized by the [[Unix]] [[operating system]], which was developed concurrently with the C programming language itself. The vast majority of modern operating systems have inherited streams from Unix, and many languages in the [[:Category:C programming language family|C programming language family]] have inherited C's file I/O interface with few if any changes (for example, [[PHP]]). The [[C++]] standard library reflects the &quot;stream&quot; concept in its syntax; see [[iostream]].

== Function overview ==

==Reading from a stream using fgetc==
The &lt;code&gt;'''fgetc'''&lt;/code&gt; function is used to read a character from a stream.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int fgetc(FILE *fp);
&lt;/source&gt;

If successful, &lt;code&gt;fgetc&lt;/code&gt; returns the next byte or character from the stream (depending on whether the file is &quot;binary&quot; or &quot;text&quot;, as discussed under &lt;code&gt;fopen&lt;/code&gt; above). If unsuccessful, fgetc returns &lt;code&gt;[[end-of-file|EOF]]&lt;/code&gt;. (The specific type of error can be determined by calling &lt;code&gt;ferror&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;feof&lt;/code&gt; with the file pointer.)

The standard [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] &lt;code&gt;'''[[getc]]'''&lt;/code&gt;, also defined in &lt;code&gt;&lt;stdio.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, behaves in almost the same way as &lt;code&gt;fgetc&lt;/code&gt;, except that—being a macro—it may evaluate its arguments more than once.

The standard function &lt;code&gt;'''getchar'''&lt;/code&gt;, also defined in &lt;code&gt;&lt;stdio.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, takes no arguments, and is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;getc([[stdin]])&lt;/code&gt;.

===EOF pitfall===
A mistake when using &lt;code&gt;fgetc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;getc&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;getchar&lt;/code&gt; is to assign the result to a variable of type &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; ''before'' comparing it to &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt;. The following code fragments exhibit this mistake, and then show the correct approach (using type int):

&lt;center&gt;
{| width=&quot;80%&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; &quot;
! Mistake
! Correction
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char c;
while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)
    putchar(c);
&lt;/source&gt;
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int c;  /* This will hold the EOF value */
while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)
    putchar(c);
&lt;/source&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Consider a system in which the type &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; is 8&amp;nbsp;bits wide, representing 256&amp;nbsp;different values. &lt;code&gt;getchar&lt;/code&gt; may return any of the 256&amp;nbsp;possible characters, and it also may return &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; to indicate [[end-of-file]], for a total of 257 different possible return values.

When &lt;code&gt;getchar&lt;/code&gt;'s result is assigned to a &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, which can represent only 256 different values, there is necessarily some loss of information—when packing 257&amp;nbsp;items into 256&amp;nbsp;slots, there [[Pigeonhole principle|must be a collision]]. The &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; value, when converted to &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, becomes indistinguishable from whichever one of the 256 characters shares its numerical value. If that character is found in the file, the above example may mistake it for an end-of-file indicator; or, just as bad, if type &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; is unsigned, then because &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; is negative, it can never be equal to any unsigned &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, so the above example will not terminate at end-of-file. It will loop forever, repeatedly printing the character which results from converting &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;.

However, this looping failure mode does not occur if the char definition is signed (C makes the signedness of the default char type implementation-dependent),&lt;ref&gt;C99 §6.2.5/15&lt;/ref&gt;  assuming the commonly used [[End-of-file|&lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; value of -1]].  However, the fundamental issue remains that if the &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; value is defined outside of the range of the &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; type, when assigned to a &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; that value is sliced and will no longer match the full &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; value necessary to exit the loop.  On the other hand, if &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; is within range of &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, this guarantees a collision between &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; and a char value.  Thus, regardless of how system types are defined, never use &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; types when testing against &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt;.

On systems where &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; are the same size (i.e., systems incompatible with minimally the POSIX and C99 standards), even the &quot;good&quot; example will suffer from the indistinguishability of &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; and some character's value. The proper way to handle this situation is to check &lt;code&gt;[[feof]]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[[ferror]]&lt;/code&gt; after &lt;code&gt;getchar&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;feof&lt;/code&gt; indicates that end-of-file has not been reached, and &lt;code&gt;ferror&lt;/code&gt; indicates that no errors have occurred, then the &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; returned by &lt;code&gt;getchar&lt;/code&gt; can be assumed to represent an actual character. These extra checks are rarely done, because most programmers assume that their code will never need to run on one of these &quot;big &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;&quot; systems. Another way is to use a compile-time assertion to make sure that &lt;code&gt;UINT_MAX &gt; UCHAR_MAX&lt;/code&gt;, which at least prevents a program with such an assumption from compiling in such a system.

==fwrite==
In the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], the &lt;code&gt;'''fread'''&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;'''fwrite'''&lt;/code&gt; functions respectively provide the [[computer file|file]] operations of [[input and output]]. &lt;code&gt;fread&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fwrite&lt;/code&gt; are [[function prototype|declared]] in &lt;code&gt;&lt;[[stdio.h]]&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

===Writing a file using fwrite===
fwrite is defined as

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
size_t fwrite (const void *array, size_t size, size_t count, FILE *stream);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;fwrite&lt;/code&gt; function writes a block of data to the stream. It will write an [[Array data structure|array]] of &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; elements to the current position in the stream. For each element, it will write &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt; bytes. The position indicator of the stream will be advanced by the number of bytes written successfully.

The function will return the number of elements written successfully. The return value will be equal to &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; if the write completes successfully. In case of a write error, the return value will be less than &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt;.

The following program opens a file named &lt;tt&gt;sample.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, writes a string of characters to the file, then closes it.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    FILE *fp;
    size_t count;
    const char *str = &quot;hello\n&quot;;

    fp = fopen(&quot;sample.txt&quot;, &quot;w&quot;);
    if(fp == NULL) {
        perror(&quot;failed to open sample.txt&quot;);
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
    count = fwrite(str, 1, strlen(str), fp);
    printf(&quot;Wrote %zu bytes. fclose(fp) %s.\n&quot;, count, fclose(fp) == 0 ? &quot;succeeded&quot; : &quot;failed&quot;);
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Writing to a stream using fputc==
The &lt;code&gt;'''fputc'''&lt;/code&gt; function is used to write a character to a stream.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int fputc(int c, FILE *fp);
&lt;/source&gt;

The parameter &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is silently converted to an &lt;code&gt;unsigned char&lt;/code&gt; before being output. If successful, &lt;code&gt;fputc&lt;/code&gt; returns the character written. If unsuccessful, fputc returns &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt;.

The standard macro &lt;code&gt;'''putc'''&lt;/code&gt;, also defined in &lt;code&gt;&lt;stdio.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, behaves in almost the same way as &lt;code&gt;fputc&lt;/code&gt;, except that—being a macro—it may evaluate its arguments more than once.

The standard function &lt;code&gt;'''putchar'''&lt;/code&gt;, also defined in &lt;code&gt;&lt;stdio.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, takes only the first argument, and is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;putc(''c'', [[stdout]])&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;''c''&lt;/code&gt; is that argument.

==Example usage==
The following C program opens a binary file called ''myfile'', reads five bytes from it, and then closes the file.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
  char buffer[5] = {0};  /* initialized to zeroes */
  int i, rc;
  FILE *fp = fopen(&quot;myfile&quot;, &quot;rb&quot;);
  if (fp == NULL) {
    perror(&quot;Failed to open file \&quot;myfile\&quot;&quot;);
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
  }
  for (i = 0; (rc = getc(fp)) != EOF &amp;&amp; i &lt; 5; buffer[i++] = rc)
    ;
  fclose(fp);
  if (i == 5) {
    puts(&quot;The bytes read were...&quot;);
    printf(&quot;%x %x %x %x %x\n&quot;, buffer[0], buffer[1], buffer[2], buffer[3], buffer[4]);
  } else
    fputs(&quot;There was an error reading the file.\n&quot;, stderr);
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is asthma? ==
Asthma is a chronic disease of the respiratory system and airways. There are many classifications of asthma based upon triggers and the severity of symptoms. Common triggers include: dust, pollen, grass, smoke, chemicals, stress, exercise and cold air.&lt;ref name = &quot;Asthma Foundation&quot;&gt;Asthma Foundation 2010, ‘Being active with asthma’, viewed 14th october 2011, http://www.asthmafoundation.org.au/uploadedFiles/Content/About_Asthma/Resources/Being_Active.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Asthma Management&quot;&gt;Sports medicine Australia ‘Asthma Management’, viewed 15th October 2011, http://sma.org.au/resources/sports-first-aid-resources/asthma-management/&lt;/ref&gt; When exposed to a trigger, the asthma sufferer's airways will narrow due to the inflammation of the airway lining, the production of extra mucus and tightening of the muscle around the airways. This will cause difficulty breathing, wheezing, coughing and chest tightness.&lt;ref name = &quot;Winter Allergic&quot;&gt;Asthma 2008, ‘Winter Allergic Asthma Challenges - Dealing with Seasonal Allergic Asthma’, viewed 15th October 2011, http://asthma.about.com/od/asthmaallergyconnection/a/winterasthma.htm &lt;/ref&gt; Exercise Induced Asthma causes typical asthma symptoms which tend to arise early during exercise as well as post exercise (30min after cessation).&lt;ref name = &quot;Asthma Management&quot;&gt;Sports medicine Australia ‘Asthma Management’, viewed 15th October 2011, http://sma.org.au/resources/sports-first-aid-resources/asthma-management/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Exercise-induced asthma&quot;&gt;Tan, R &amp; Spector, S 1998, ‘Exercise-induced asthma’, Sports Medicine, vol. 25 Issue 1, p. 1-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Australian Lung Foundation, ‘Asthma and exercise in sport’, viewed 15th October, http://www.nevdgp.org.au/info/lungf/asthma-exercise-health.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Why does cold weather exacerbate my asthma? ==

During winter and in cold weather, allergens and irritants are more likely to be present indoors, increasing symptoms for asthma sufferers who are affected by these triggers.&lt;ref name = &quot;Allergy Relief&quot;&gt;Allergy Relief 2008, ‘Coping with asthma during winter’, viewed 14th October 2011, http://www.achooallergy.com/winter-asthma.asp&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name = &quot;Winter Allergic&quot;&gt;Asthma 2008, ‘Winter Allergic Asthma Challenges - Dealing with Seasonal Allergic Asthma’, viewed 15th October 2011, http://asthma.about.com/od/asthmaallergyconnection/a/winterasthma.htm&lt;/ref&gt;The cold and dry air can cause and increase the severity of asthma symptoms. The exact cause of asthma due to inhalation of cold air is not yet clear, but it is known that the temperature of air is very important. Inhalation of cold, dry air causes the normally warm, humid lining of the airways to become cold and dry. This causes our body to respond by tightening the airways and thickening the mucus, leading to the symptoms of asthma.&lt;ref&gt;Giesbrecht, G &amp; Younes, M 1995, ‘Exercise and cold induced asthma’, Canadian Journal of Applied Physiology, Vol. 20, Issue 3 &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name = &quot;Asthma&quot;&gt;Schroeder, Jan 2010, ‘Asthma’, American Fitness, Vol. 28, Issue 4 &lt;/ref&gt;When exercising, our breathing frequency also increases, which can exacerbate Exercise Induced Asthma.&lt;ref name = &quot;Exercise-induced asthma&quot;&gt;Tan, R &amp; Spector, S 1998, ‘Exercise-induced asthma’, Sports Medicine, vol. 25 Issue 1, p. 1-6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Can I exercise in cold weather? ==
Research has shown that exercise is beneficial in reducing severity of asthma symptoms as well as improving general fitness. &lt;ref name = &quot;Asthma&quot;&gt;Schroeder, Jan 2010, ‘Asthma’, American Fitness, Vol. 28, Issue 4 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, I, Shaw, B &amp; Brown, G 2010, ‘Role of diaphragmatic breathing and aerobic exercise in improving pulmonary function and maximal oxygen consumption in asthmatics’, Science &amp; Sports, Vol. 25, Issue 3 &lt;/ref&gt;If asthma is well controlled and extra measures are taken when exercising outside, sufferers can still fully participate in and enjoy exercise during the cold weather.&lt;ref&gt;Long, P &amp; Mason, M 1994, ‘Out of breath on the slopes’, Health (Time Inc. Health), Vol. 8 Issue 2, p10, 4p &lt;/ref&gt;

== How do I best control my asthma for exercise in the cold weather? ==
Taking precautions such as exercising in sheltered areas and during warmer periods of the day will help reduce asthma symptoms in response to cold air inhalation. Increasing the time spent exercising indoors will help prevent asthma caused by the cold environment. Conducting a good warm up and warm down will also help reduce effects of Exercise Induced Asthma. &lt;ref name = &quot;Allergy Relief&quot;&gt;Allergy Relief 2008, ‘Coping with asthma during winter’, viewed 14th October 2011, http://www.achooallergy.com/winter-asthma.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Exercise-induced asthma&quot;&gt;Tan, R &amp; Spector, S 1998, ‘Exercise-induced asthma’, Sports Medicine, vol. 25 Issue 1, p. 1-6 &lt;/ref&gt;Wearing a mask over the nose and mouth helps warm and humidify the air that is breathed in during cold weather. The continued maintenance of prescribed asthma preventatives and inhalers is recommended in combination with these extra controls.&lt;ref&gt;Dinnall, A 2003, ‘Winter asthma triggers’, viewed 14th October, http://hnewhizkidz.com/ACE/ASTHMA/winter.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Exercise-induced asthma&quot;&gt;Tan, R &amp; Spector, S 1998, ‘Exercise-induced asthma’, Sports Medicine, vol. 25 Issue 1, p. 1-6&lt;/ref&gt;

== What exercise type or sport is best during cold weather? ==
All types of exercise are safe to participate in during cold weather if recommended asthma management routines and tips on controlling asthma during cold weather are followed. Swimming is an excellent activity during cold weather as indoor pool air is warm and moist. Other indoor exercise such as team sports and gym will also provide warmer conditions for exercise. &lt;ref name = &quot;Asthma&quot;&gt;Schroeder, Jan 2010, ‘Asthma’, American Fitness, Vol. 28, Issue 4 &lt;/ref&gt;Scuba diving is the only sport in which asthmatics cannot participate for medical reasons.&lt;ref name= &quot;Asthma Foundation&quot;&gt;Asthma Foundation 2010, ‘Being active with asthma’, viewed 14th october 2011, http://www.asthmafoundation.org.au/uploadedFiles/Content/About_Asthma/Resources/Being_Active.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

There are differences in the diagrams of orbital elements, and being a bit of a noob with this stuff, I don't know which one to believe.  The Argument of Perihelion and the Longitude of the Ascending Node are the things that differ.  The first diagram also has rather crappy symbols drawn in.  It looks unprofessional.  Also, Veneral Point?  Is that a spelling error (of Vernal)?</text>

[[File:AMI scheme.png|thumb|'''Myocardial Infarction''' [1] Blockage in a branch of the left '''coronary artery''' leading to [2] death of heart tissue on the anterior wall of the heart]]


[[w:Myocardial Infarction#cite_note-lymphnet-9|Myocardial Infarction]] (or Heart Attack) is when blood flow to a part of your heart is blocked for a long enough time that part of the heart muscle is damaged or dies. Cardiovascular and Strength training is a known and proven treatment and recovery method following the onset of myocardial infarct increasing the contractibility and decreasing the risk of repeat attacks.&lt;br /&gt;



==Background==
====What is a Myocardial Infarction?====
[[w:Myocardial Infarction#cite_note-lymphnet-9|Myocardial Infarction]], commonly know as a '''heart attack''', is when blood flow to a part of your heart is blocked for a long enough time that part of the heart muscle is damaged or dies. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001246/&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous factors that can influence the onset of Myocardial infarction, but the main cause is a blockage of the [[w:Coronary Artery#cite_note-lymphnet-9|Coronary Artery]] which brings oxygenated blood back to the heart.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001246/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

The underlying cause of a heart attack is coronary heart disease (CHD).

Some people may not know they have CHD until they have a heart attack. For others, a heart attack can happen after weeks, months or years of treatment for CHD. 

CHD is the slow build-up of fatty deposits on the inner wall of the arteries that supply your heart muscle with blood. These fatty deposits, called plaque, gradually clog and narrow the inside channel of the arteries. It is a process that begins early in life and continues over the years. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.heartfoundation.org.au/your-heart/cardiovascular-conditions/Pages/heart-attack.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

====Risk Factors====
A number of factors increase your risk of having a heart attack. These include: 

'''Non-modifiable risk factors'''

* increasing age
* having family history of heart disease

'''Modifiable risk factors'''

* smoking - both active smoking and being exposed  to second-hand smoke
* high blood cholesterol
* high blood pressure
* diabetes
* being physically inactive
* being overweight
* depression, social isolation and lack of quality support

Reducing or eliminating these risk factors can be helpful in reducing the risk of having a repeat heart attack. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.heartfoundation.org.au/your-heart/know-the-risks/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recovering from Myocardial Infarction====
Recovering from a Myocardial infarction can be a long process, requiring you to make big changes in your life. A number of steps need to be taken in order to recover efficiently from Myocardial Infarction. These changes include modified '''diet''', '''medications''' and an '''exercise''' program. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-information-heart-attack-recovery&lt;/ref&gt; Myocardial infarction's can alter an individual's responses to both maximal and submaximal exercise. Patients have a reduced level of cardiorespiratory fitness and a reduced oxygen transport capacity due to a diminished cardiac output (due to reduced contractile force of the left ventricle). Patients will also be taking a variety of medications, including beta-blockers, anti-coagulants, anti-arrhythmic drugs and vasodilators to decrease  heart rate and blood pressure. These factors should be taken into account before any training program.


==Benefits of Exercise==
There are several potential benefits to exercise training in patients following a heart attack. It has shown: to increase VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max by an average of 20%; increase heart rate variability; reduce symptoms of angina; decrease blood platelet adhesiveness and blood viscosity; and increase vascular regeneration. Exercise has also shown improve psychosocial well-being. 
Exercise is known to improve cardiovascular health. Although nearly everyone can exercise safely after a heart attack, the intensity and duration of exercise depends upon the severity of your heart disease. 
Exercise in particular will increase the contractibility of the heart muscle following the stress of a heart attack, help to lower your risk of repeated infarct, reduce your risk of death from heart disease, and often increase your ability to exercise and be active. &lt;ref&gt;http://circres.ahajournals.org/content/100/7/937.full.pdf+html&lt;/ref&gt; Overall recovery time can be improved and select individuals can
return to a healthier active lifestyle sooner than previously anticipated. 

==Resistance and Cardiovascular Training Guidelines==
===Cardiac Rehabilitation===
The Heart Foundation and the World Health Organization recommend that people who have had a heart attack, heart surgery, coronary angioplasty, angina or other heart or blood vessel disease attend an appropriate cardiac rehabilitation and prevention program. 
Supervised CR programs increase physical activity and may lead to a substantial reduction in mortality. Physical activity is a core component of CR programs and is recommended to patients after discharge

====Phase 1====
Phase 1 takes place while the patient is still in the hospital, consisting primarily of educational sessions
and multiple short bouts of physical activity that typically range between 2
and 6 days, depending on the patient's progress.
Early stages involve simple exposure to gravitational stress. 
This includes intermittent standing and sitting, followed rhythmic exercise involving large muscle groups, like walking, stair climbing and rowing. 

====Phase 2====
Phase 2 is considered outpatient rehabilitation but involves a supervised exercise program that typically begins 1 to 4 weeks after hospitalization
and lasts 1 to 12 weeks

====Phase 3====
Phase 3 is an unsupervised community-based, high-risk maintenance program that can go on indefinitely. Resistance exercise implemented during phase 3 is more typical of what one might recommend for the general aging
population independent of heart disease.

Any training should be progressive, but
more caution should be taken with certain exercises or machmes that mav result
in increases in intrathoracic pressure that
typically have been avoided in this group

      <text xml:space="preserve">It seems that by default, wikibooks generates a table of contents from the paragraph headings if the wikibooks markup &quot;==heading text==&quot; is used at the head of each section.

The Contents seem to be handcoded, which requires manual maintenance as the document grows.


===Fora documentation===
==Overview==
==Audience==

Automatically generates a TOC similar to:

Fora Documentation
1. Overview
2. Audience

 4.2 First program

Do we want to use wikibooks markup to get the benefits it offers?
Do I generate a separate document... say FORA Tutorial... and link it into this page
Or do I add inline in this document, which will result in a large unwieldy document, probably against the philosophy of wikibooks.

== Execution speed ==
I do not know FORA but logic and practical observation dictates that a machine language compile will always run faster than code that requires an extra layer like a Virtual Machine. The speed differences may be diminute (depending on the level of evolution of the bytecode generator and the virtual machine) but still exist.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 08:18, 7 November 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a section to explain fair wage-effort hypothesis in the behavioral economics 

==Introduction==

Have you ever thought of fairness as to wage? What is a fair wage for you? If you feel like you receive a unfair wage for your work, what are you going to you. Here is a story to introduce the concept of fair wage-effort hypothesis. Bill and Hu who are close friends work in the different factories, but they are responsible for the same kind of work. One day, they occasionally talked about how much they made. It shocked Hu due to the wage differential. Hu thought it was unfair to receive less wage for the same amount of work. As a result, he decided to work less hard. However, it is not the only case. This story reflects part of fair-wage hypothesis. Basically, if someone feels he does not receive wage he think it is fair, he will proportionately diminish his effort on work. This is the main idea of fair wage-effort hypothesis. It can be translated to e = min (w/w*, 1), where e equals effort a worker contributes to his work, w equals the actual wage, and w* equals the fair wage, and 1 is maximum and normal effort corresponding to the market-clear wage. So how to interpret e = min (w/w*, 1)? A worker will exert the lower number that represents effort in the function.

==Motivation==
Through looking at 9 motivations for the fair wage effort hypothesis, you will have a better understanding of it. All these 9 motivations are credited to George A. Akerlof and Janet L. Yellen's and from the academic journal ''The Fair Wage-Effort Hypothesis and Unemployment.''

# ''Equity Theory'': Adams [1963] assumed that the exchange between the perceived value labor input and the perceived value of remuneration should be equal. There is an economic formula to interpret it: e = w/w*, where w is the perceived value of remuneration, w* is the perceived value of a unit of effective labor, and e is the number of units of effective labor input. Akerlof and Yellen further explained that workers may change their actual effort or their perceived effort e if they think they do not receive a fair wage for their effort e = 1 based on psychologists' finding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;&gt;{{Citation| last=Akerlof| first=George A.| last2=Yellen | first2=Janet L. | title=The Fair Wage-Effort Hypothesis and Unemployment| journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics| volume=105| issue=2| year=1990| pages=255-283|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2937787}}&lt;/ref&gt; They used a realistic study conducted by Lawler and O'gara [1967] to support this statement. In the study, Lawler and O'gara compared the performance of workers who were received 25 cents per interview with the performance of workers were intensely underpaid at 10 cents per interview. &lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; They found that the lower paid interviewers conducted much poorer quality of interviews. 
# ''Relative Deprivation Theory'': Relative deprivation theory indicates that how people think of fairness are grounded on comparisons with salient others. &lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; 
# ''Social Exchange Theory'': Akerlof and Yellen used Blau's models of exchange [1955] and Homans' [1961] social exchange theory to explain the fair wage-effort hypothesis. Blau's model hypothesizes that equivalent rewards will be achieved on both sides of an exchange after the costs are deducted. In Blau's empirical study [1955] motivating him to propose this hypothesis, the agents who was in charge of investigative work could consult with other agents as to difficult problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; He found that the average agents tended to consult more with the agents with the average expertise. The consultation between the average and the experts were not frequent due to less reciprocation based on Blau's explanation. Homans [1961] has a similar theory that assumes people will get angry if they don't get what they think they deserve. This theory provides a simple proposition to Akerlof and Yellen's model. If workers think they receive a unfair wage, they will be angry. The anger probably reduce workers of labor input. 
# ''Empirical Observation of Work Restriction in the Workplace'': Two examples are applied to explain the idea of empirical observation of work restriction in the workplace. Sociologist Mathewson [1969] as a participant observer recorded 223 instances of restriction in 105 establishments in 47 different locations from his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; He concluded, &quot;occasionally workers have an idea that they are worth than management is willing to pay them. When they are not receiving the wage they think fair, they adjust their production to the pay received.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; It underlies the fair wage-effort hypothesis. Another sociologist, Donald Roy, observed an interesting phenomenon from his own experience that heavy papers would be suddenly tore and stuck to the machine's rollers during the work due to the machine crew who was not satisfied with his wage put excessive stress on the machine when he operated it. &lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt;  
# ''Literature, Jealousy, and Retribution'': Generally speaking, literature provides a lot of good examples about jealousy and retribution, the relation between equity and performance. &lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; The story as an example is about how Joseph is treated by his jealous brothers(''Bible'' Genesis, 37-50).
#''Personnel Management Texts'': Textbooks on personnel management value the equitable treatment of workers as an extremely important factor in the labor market.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; Akerlof and Yellen used an quotation from Kochan and Barocci to illuminate it. The quotation was that &quot;there is no single factor in the whole field of labor relations that does more to break down morale, create individual dissatisfaction, encourage absenteeism, increase labor turnover and hamper production than obviously unjust inequalities in the wage rates paid to different individuals in the same labor group within the same plant&quot; (Kochan and Barocci, 1985,p.249). 
# ''Wage-Salary Secrecy'': It is not usual to openly discuss wages and salaries with other employees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; Also, organizations in most cases don't allow their employees to disclose wages and salaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; 
# ''Wage Patterns'': One wage pattern given by Dickens and Katz is that if industries have high wages for one occupation, they tend to have high wages for other occupations. &lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; Also, the fair wage-effort hypothesis provides better explanations for wage compression and the behavior of union-nonunion wage differentials. 
# ''Patterns of Unemployment'': The fair wage-effort hypothesis provides a potential explanations for correlations, such as unemployment-skill correlations. &lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt;

==Advantages over the original efficiency wage model==
In terms of labor market, the fair wage-effort provides better explanations for some phenomena, such as the existence of involuntary unemployment. Akerlof and Yellen thought a efficiency wage model based on fairness explained the leading efficiency wage model build on maximizing behavior failed to predict wage compression, negative correlation between unemployment and skill, and the strong positive correlation between industry profits and industry wage; in contrast, the efficiency wage model with respect to fairness better explained these difficulties. &lt;ref name = &quot;Yellen&quot;&gt;{{Citation| last=Akerlof| first=George A.| last2=Yellen | first2=Janet L. | title=Fairness and Unemployment| journal=The American Economic Review| volume=78| issue=2| year=1988| pages=44-49|url=http://www.jstor.org.ezproxy2.library.arizona.edu/stable/1818095}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the efficiency wage model with the feature of hedonism that workers hedonistically maximize utility merely subject to their pay and their effort lacks of worker motivation and seems simplistic.&lt;ref name =&quot;Yellen&quot;/&gt;

==Models based on the the fair wage-effort hypothesis==
===A Rudimentary Model of Unemployment With the Fair Wage-effort Hypothesis===
This model built on fair wage-effort hypothesis (e = min (w/w*, 1) is used to explain unemployment. And it is credited to Akerlof and Yellen. It is assumed that the fair wage, w*, is exogenously determined, there is a single class of labor, and it is perfectly competitive market.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt;  
In addition to the function e = min (w/w*, 1), there is a production function: Q = αeL,
Where: 
* Q = out put
* α = the marginal product of a unit of effective labor
* e = average effort of laborers hired 
* L = the labor hired.
Also, there is a trick concerning with w*. W* is  not only fair wage, but it also can be a benchmark to the marginal cost of a unit of effective labor. In other words, the marginal cost of a unit of effective labor is at least as large as w*. W/e, the wage per unit of effort, is real marginal cost of effective labor. Finally, Akerlof and Yellen assume there is a fixed supply of labor, which is independent of the wage rate. &lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; 

====Analysis====
In the model, the unemployment rate is either 100% or zero.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; 
# In the case that α exceeds w* (firm will gain benefit from hiring one additional worker): At the beginning, Akerlof and Yellen assumes the aggregate supply of labor is great than the aggregate demand for labor so that there is unemployment and the firm is free to set any wage it wants due to this phenomenon of excessive supply of labor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; As a result, a firm's goal is to choose a wage to minimizes w/e.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; If the firm chooses to pay workers any wage not exceeding w*, the marginal cost of effective labor will be w* instead of w/e.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; This is because w/e is less than w*/e and the prerequisite is that the marginal cost of a unit of effective labor is at least as large as w*. The following process will be like the marginal product of effective labor &gt; the marginal cost of effective labor (α &gt; w*) -&gt; the firm hires an infinite amount of labor -&gt; aggregate excess demand for labor -&gt; w &gt; w* (the firm increases the wage, under the competition).&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; However, the demand for labor is still infinite when wage is between w* and α.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; It's because the marginal product of effective labor is still larger than the marginal cost of effective labor. In a word, if  α &gt; w*, the unemployment is zero and all labor will be hired. 
# In the case that w* exceeds α: the marginal cost of effective labor is greater than the marginal product of effective labor, a firm no longer hires any worker. As a result, the unemployment rate is 100%.

==Different Approaches to the Fair Wage-effort hypothesis==
Thomas I. Palley has a different view of the fair wage-effort hypothesis. There are two differences between his fair wage-effort model and Akerloff and Yellen's model. One is that Palley focused on wage-profit, which indicates worker-firm concerns, while Akerloff and Yellen emphasize on wage-wage, which reflects comparisons between workers. &lt;ref name=&quot;Palley&quot;&gt;{{Citation| last=Palley| first=Thomas I.| title=The Fair Wage-Effort Hypothesis:Implications for the Distribution of Income and Dual Labor Markets| journal=Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization| volume=24| issue=2| year=1994| pages=195-205|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167268194900264}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other difference is that Palley's model does not have psychological consequences in contrast to A-Y's because someone argues that effort and more involvement in the work increase workers' happiness. &lt;ref name=&quot;Palley&quot;/&gt; Akerloff and Yellen's fair wage-effort hypothesis is based on the how workers value their treatment. If they psychologically think they does not receive fair wage, they will proportionally reduce their effort. However, this may be the case that feeling involvement in work enhances their happiness, workers will not reduce their effort proportionally even when they think they are not paid fairly.It's difficult to decide which is overweight. 

Palley thinks treating labor as commodity misrepresent the nature of the labor exchange because people can intentionally react to the exchange, unlike the dead commodity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Palley&quot;/&gt; Also, he provides a new way to look at the relationship between fairness and effort. His idea is that effort depends on the relation of fairness-firm's non-labor surplus: e = Min [e(wL/(pq-rk)), e(1)], e'&gt;0, e&quot;&lt;0, e(0)= 0, e= e(1) if pq -rk -wL&lt;0, Where:
* e = level of effort
* w = nominal wage
* L = level of labor input
* p = price of output
* r = cost of capital
* k = level of capital stock
The equation e = Min [e(wL/(pq-rk)), e(1)] specifies effort as a function of the level of non-labor surplus and makes a connection between the value they receive and the value they contribute.
&lt;ref name=&quot;Palley&quot;/&gt; pq = the value of output, rk = the non-labor cost, wL = labor cost, and pq - rk = the value the labor create. If wL - (pq -rk) = 0, effort is e(1); if wL - (pq -rk) &lt; 0, effort declines; if wL -(pq - rk) &gt; 0, effort is e (1).&lt;ref name=&quot;Palley&quot;/&gt;

==Relation to Fair Wage-Effort Model==
Fair wage-effort hypothesis a member of the family of the efficiency wage models. It is a sub-model with improvements to the efficiency model.&lt;ref name = &quot;Blackwell&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.blackwell.dk/writing/non-fiction/academic/economics/Efficiency%20Wages.pdf|title= Efficiency Wage Theory|author=Blackwell, Andrew |format =PDF|accessdate= 4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficiency Wage Theory==
Generally, there are five sub-types of efficiency wage models.&lt;ref name = &quot;Blackwell&quot;/&gt; They are Shirking Models, Gift-Exchange Model, Fair Wage-effort Model, Adverse Selection Model, and Turnover Model.
*''Shirking Model''(Shapiro and Stiglitz): If workers receive a higher wage, the cost of losing their job becomes higher, and this acts an incentive for wokers not shirk and risk being fired.&lt;ref name = &quot;Blackwell&quot;/&gt;
* ''Gift-Exchange Model'' (Akerlof): A higher wage is seen by workers as a gift from the firm, and workers will want to return this gift in the form of higher effort.

==Introduction==

Have you ever thought of fairness as to wage? What is fair wage for you? Generally, people tend to compare their own wage with others in similar situations. Here is a story that can introduce the concept of fair wage-effort hypothesis. Bill and Hu who are close friends work in the different factories, but they are responsible for the same kind of work. One day, they occasionally talked about how much they make. It shocked Hu due to the wage differential. Hu thought it was unfair to receive less wage for the same amount of work. As a result, he decided to work less hard. However, it is not the only case. This story reflects part of fair-wage hypothesis. Basically, if someone feels he does not receive wage he think it is fair, he will proportionately diminish his effort on work. It can be translated to e = min (w/w*, 1), where e equals effort a worker contributes to his work, w equals the actual wage, and w* equals the fair wage, and 1 is normal effort corresponding to the market-clear wage. 
So how to interpret e = min (w/w*, 1)? Basically,a worker will exert the lower number that represents effort in the function.

__TOC__
==What's the Problem?== 

&lt;big&gt;'''''P'''''&lt;/big&gt;arkinson's disease (''PD'') is a neurodegenerative condition that affects the central nervous system (CNS)&lt;ref&gt;Crizzle, A. (2006). Is Physical Exercise Beneficial for Persons with Parkinson's Disease? Clinical Journal of Sports Medicine , 442-445&lt;/ref&gt;. An individual with ''PD'' exhibits unprogrammed cell death (necrosis) of cells responsible for producing the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, M. (2003). The Effects of Balance Training and High-Intensity Resistance. Arch Phys Med Rehabil , 1109-1117&lt;/ref&gt;. Dopamine is involved in motor control, and patients with ''PD'' consequently have reduced functionality of certain body movements due to a lack of dopamine. Whilst there is no known cure, high intensity resistance training is one of the best treatments for ''PD''. Resistance training limits the effects of symptoms, allowing the patient to regain a certain level of motor control&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, M. (2003). The Effects of Balance Training and High-Intensity Resistance. Arch Phys Med Rehabil , 1109-1117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kwakkel, A. (2008). Impact of physical therapy for Parkinson's disease: A critical review of the literature. Parkinson's and Related Disorders , 478-487.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Parkinson's Warning Signs==
PD is associated with several warning signs that indicate the presence of the disease. It is important to know these sign in order to understand the health risks involved with the disease&lt;ref&gt;Kwakkel, A. (2008). Impact of physical therapy for Parkinson's disease: A critical review of the literature. Parkinson's and Related Disorders , 478-487.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Some signs you may witness:
:::::::{|
|-
| - '''Uncontrolled shaking'''    ||||||||||  - '''Loss of balance and coordination'''
|-
| -''' Speech difficulties'''    |||||||||| - '''Stiffness'''
|-
| - '''Abnormal posture'''     ||||||||||  - '''Memory loss'''
|}

==Benefits of Resistance Exercise==

Resistance training can reduce the effects of Parkinson’s disease and lower risk factors such as stumbling or falling&lt;ref&gt;Michael, J. (2008). Parkinson's disease and resistive exercise: Rationale, review, and recommendations. Movement Disorders , 1-11&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Benefits include:

::::* '''Improved muscle strength.'''
::::* '''Better balance, reducing the risk of falls.'''
::::* '''Maintenance of posture.'''
::::* '''Improved walking ability.'''
::::* '''Improved brain functionality, leading to greater motor control'''

==Types of Resistance Training==
[[File:Squat.png|frame|alt=squat|'''''A squat, one of many examples of strength training exercises for the legs''''']]

There are several types of resistance training methods that can be used for Parkinson's sufferers&lt;ref&gt;Morris, M. (2006). Locomotor Training in People With Parkinson Disease. Physical Therapy , 1426-1435&lt;/ref&gt;.

Some resistance training options are:
::::::::* '''Strength/hypertrophy training.'''
::::::::* '''Plyometrics.'''
::::::::* '''Resistance band training.'''
::::::::* '''Isomteric training''' ''(force produced without movement, commonly known as tensing).''
::::::::* '''Isokinetic training''' ''(force produced with movement at a constant speed).''

Strength/hypertrophy training is highly recommended for persons with ''PD'' as its high intensity relative to other training techniques results in greater adaptations that can reduce some of the effects of the disease&lt;ref&gt;Nallegowda, M. (2002). Role of Sensory Input and Muscle Strength in Maintenance of Balance, Gait, and Posture in Parkinson's Disease: A Pilot Study. American Journal of Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation , 898-908&lt;/ref&gt;.

&lt;big&gt;===== &lt;big&gt;'''Kick The Blues With Exercise'''&lt;/big&gt; =====&lt;/big&gt;
:::Using Exercise to Treat Depression
==== Background ====
Depressive illness is a severe medical condition with individuals suffering from prolonged and persistent unhappiness, negativity and problems coping with daily life. No one is immune to depression and approximately 20% of people will experience it at some point in their lives.&lt;sup&gt;1,2&lt;/sup&gt; For most people, a build up of stress is the precursor to depression, although some individuals are at a higher risk of suffering the disease, including people who:&lt;br /&gt;
* Are unable to communicate effectively with friends and family - about both everyday and serious issues
* Have multiple demands on their time - leaving little to no relaxation time
* Have certain personality traits - for example anxiety, prone to worry and a lack of self confidence
* Have fragile biochemistry - either due to illness, genetics or recent childbirth
* Imbibe in excessive amounts of alcohol or marijuana&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

==== Signs &amp; Symptoms ====
The signs and symptoms of depression will vary between individuals as depression will affect each person differently. However, some common symptoms may include:
* Lowering of mood - feeling sad and tearful almost every day
* Persistent negativity and pessimism - everything feels pointless even their lives
* Tiredness and fatigue - due to disturbances in normal sleeping patterns
* Loss of appetite and sex drive
* Loss of pleasure and motivation - in relation to normally enjoyable activities&lt;sup&gt;1,2,3&lt;/sup&gt;

==== Common Treatments ====
* Anti-depressant prescription drugs - to restore chemical balance within the brain
* Therapy or cognitive training - to teach and encourage individuals to think and act in a more positive manner
* Community support programs - to assist with education, work placements and show community acceptance 


&lt;big&gt;'''EXERCISE AS TREATMENT'''&lt;/big&gt;

There is growing evidence to support the idea that physical exercise is an effective treatment for depression, with studies showing a decrease in signs and symptoms in exercise participants.&lt;sup&gt;7,8&lt;/sup&gt; Exercise can:
* '''Regulate Mood''' - frequent exercise is seen to have an anti-depressant effect as it alters the neurochemistry of the brain in much the same way that anti-depressant drugs do. While anti-depressant drugs act to inhibit the re-uptake of serotonin in the brain exercise actually increases brain serotonin producing much the same effect.&lt;sup&gt;4,7,8&lt;/sup&gt;
* '''Decrease Negative Focus''' - exercise decreases the tendency to focus on perceived negative attributes while encouraging feelings of self-worth, perceived control and positive feedback.&lt;sup&gt;4,5,8&lt;/sup&gt;
* '''Break Stress Cycles''' - leisure time physical activity gives people a break from factors causing depression related stress. It also prevents the time stress associated with fitting an exercise program into busy schedules as it is done in designated down time and it may help to foster new social relationships further breaking down stress cycles.&lt;sup&gt;5,6,7,8&lt;/sup&gt;
* '''Boost Energy &amp; Aid Sleep''' - exercise increases central endorphin concentration which provides a boost in energy and breaks the pattern of insomnia&lt;sup&gt;5,6&lt;/sup&gt;
* '''Teach Coping Mechanisms''' - exercise teaches how to deal with feelings of discomfort and exertion, sweating and heavy breathing, which can help in daily life when stressful situations mirror these feelings. Adaptation and a decrease in the feeling of discomfort generally occurs quite quickly in depressed individuals as depression is often assocated with reduced levels of physical activity. &lt;sup&gt;4,5&lt;/sup&gt;
* '''Be Cost Effective and Relatively Side Effect Free''' &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;
* '''Provide Other Health Benefits''' - including weight loss and reduced cardiovascular risk&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;

==== Recommendations ====
There is no specific exercise program to aid in the treatment of depression, however certain recommendations that do apply include:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
* Setting realistic goals and beginning with a program appropriate to ones fitness level - unrealistic goals and training regimes can increase feelings of worthlessness when an individual fails to reach set targets, causing exercise adherence to be lost. It is important to remember that a simple walk is often enough for individuals with limited fitness.&lt;sup&gt;3,4&lt;/sup&gt;
* Exercise regularly - increased serotonin levels will not remain in the brain indefinitely, as such it is recommended that individuals participate in 3 - 5 sessions per week. &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
* Exercise at a moderate to vigorous intensity level for maximal benefit. &lt;sup&gt;4,5,6&lt;/sup&gt;
* Exercise  aerobically - increasing endorphin concentration provides the greatest results in lowering depression. &lt;sup&gt;4,5&lt;/sup&gt;
* Working with an exercise professional - this will help with social support, program adherence and the development of a program suited to current fitness levels.

==== Limitations ====
There are only a few limitations on exercise as a treatment for depression: 
* Onset - it is &lt;u&gt;incorrect&lt;/u&gt; to believe that there is a delay in the onset of exercise induced anti-depressant effects when compared with drug therapy; it is much the same for both at approximately 2 - 4 weeks with exercise adherence. &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
* Exercise intensity - beginning at an intensity above an individuals ability may cause a negative mood reaction. &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;
* Level of depression - studies are inconclusive about whether severe depression can be treated by exercise alone or whether it may require a combination of exercise and drug therapy. &lt;sup&gt;4,5,6,8&lt;/sup&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Darts is played by two teams with each team having one member or more but an equal number in each team. Before the start of the game, the teams are generally allowed 9 throws each as warm-up. To decide who goes first in the game, each team will nominate one member to throw a single dart. The one which is closest to the bull's eye gets to go first.

A turn is made up of throwing 3 darts successively after which the darts are retrieved. Each member gets 1 turn. Turns are alternated between the two competing teams. The score from each turn is the sum of scores of each dart thrown. Any throw which is not a foul/no-throw is considered for scoring. If the foot crosses the throwing line, or the member loses balance and crosses the line after the throw, it is considered a foul. Darts which are on board at the end of turn are considered for scoring. Those darts which strike off-board, or fall off in middle of a turn are not considered.

Scoring:
The dart board is divided into 20 sectors. Each sector has a number attached to it which will be the score if a dart lands in that sector. There are special zones where the scoring slightly varies
Bull's-eye: 50 points : It is the innermost red circle.
Bull: 25 points : It is the green ring surrounding the Bull's-eye.
Triple ring: Sector points X 3 : It is the middle ring. A dart landing in this ring will receive thrice the sector points.
Double ring: Sector points X 2 : It is the outermost ring. A dart landing in this ring will receive twice the sector points.

Game:
The most common game that is played is &quot;301&quot;. It literally is a count down from 301 to 0. All teams start at 301 points and the amount they score in each turn is deducted from this total. First team to reach 0 wins.
For a team to start scoring, they first have to hit a Double. Then the countdown to zero starts. The end gets quite tricky as the teams are expected to reach exactly zero. i.e. in the last turn the member is expected to hit the exact number of points required to reach zero. If he gets more than the required, he goes bust and the points in that turn won't be counted.

Each game is one leg and the match is best of three legs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''modf''' is the c reference function, this function breaks number or value into its fractional and integral parts, these parts have same sign as their argument.

== Variants ==

In [[c (programming language)]], the function prototype of the ''modf'' function look like following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
double modf(double num, double *i);

float modf(float num, float *i);

      <text xml:space="preserve">sqrt () is a C library function.
It is  mainly associated with programming language.
It is considerd under [math.h] header file.
 
'''''function:'''''
      #include&lt;cmath.h&gt;
      double sqrt (double x );
      float sqrt (float x );
      long double sqrt (long double x );


'''''Description:'''''
sqrt computes square root. And returns The square root of x.
In C++, this function is overloaded in &lt;complex&gt; and &lt;valarray&gt; (see complex sqrt and valarray sqrt).
If the argument is negative, a domain error occurs, setting the global variable errno to the value EDOM.


'''''Return Value:'''''
Square root of x.

'''''Portability:'''''
In C, only the double version of this function exists with this name.

''Example:''
/* sqrt example */
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;

int main ()
{
  double param, result;
  param = 1024.0;
  result = sqrt (param);
  printf (&quot;sqrt(%lf) = %lf\n&quot;, param, result );
  return 0;
}


Output:
sqrt(1024.000000) = 32.000000


''See also:''
pow	Raise to power (function).

log	Compute natural logarithm (function).

exp     compute exponent of number (function) .

All the above are Related functions of sqrt ().

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Opening a file using fopen==
A file is opened using &lt;code&gt;'''fopen'''&lt;/code&gt;, which returns an I/O [[stream (computing)|stream]] attached to the specified file or other device from which reading and writing can be done. If the function fails, it returns a [[null pointer]].

The related C library function &lt;code&gt;'''freopen'''&lt;/code&gt; performs the same operation after first closing any open stream associated with its parameters.

They are defined as

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
FILE *fopen(const char *path, const char *mode);
FILE *freopen(const char *path, const char *mode, FILE *fp);
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;fopen&lt;/code&gt; function is essentially a slightly higher-level wrapper for the &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; [[system call]] of [[Unix]] [[operating system]]s. In the same way, &lt;code&gt;fclose&lt;/code&gt; is often a thin wrapper for the Unix system call &lt;code&gt;close&lt;/code&gt;, and the C &lt;code&gt;FILE&lt;/code&gt; structure itself often corresponds to a Unix [[file descriptor]]. In [[POSIX]] environments, the &lt;code&gt;'''fdopen'''&lt;/code&gt; function can be used to initialize a &lt;code&gt;FILE&lt;/code&gt; structure from a file descriptor; however, file descriptors are a purely Unix concept not present in standard C.

The &lt;code&gt;mode&lt;/code&gt; parameter to &lt;code&gt;fopen&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;freopen&lt;/code&gt; must be a [[C string|string]] that begins with one of the following sequences:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!colspan=3| mode || description || starts..
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;r&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;rb&lt;/tt&gt; || || open for reading (The file must exist) || beginning
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;w&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;wb&lt;/tt&gt; || || open for writing (creates file if it doesn't exist). Deletes content and overwrites the file. || beginning
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;ab&lt;/tt&gt; || || open for appending (creates file if it doesn't exist) || end
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;r+&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;rb+&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;r+b&lt;/tt&gt; || open for reading and writing (The file must exist)|| beginning
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;w+&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;wb+&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;w+b&lt;/tt&gt; || open for reading and writing. If file exists deletes content and overwrites the file, otherwise creates an empty new file || beginning
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;a+&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;ab+&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;a+b&lt;/tt&gt; || open for reading and writing (append if file exists) || end
|}

The &quot;&lt;tt&gt;b&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; stands for binary. The C standard provides for two kinds of files—[[text file]]s and [[binary file]]s—although operating systems are not required to distinguish between the two. A ''text file'' is a file consisting of text arranged in lines with some sort of distinguishing [[newline|end-of-line]] character or sequence (in [[Unix]], a bare [[line feed]] character; in [[Microsoft Windows]], a [[carriage return]] followed by a line feed). When bytes are read in from a text file, an end-of-line sequence is usually mapped to a linefeed for ease in processing. When a text file is written to, a bare linefeed is mapped to the OS-specific end-of-line character sequence before writing. A ''binary file'' is a file where bytes are read in &quot;raw&quot;, and delivered &quot;raw&quot;, without any kind of mapping.

When a file is opened with update mode ( '&lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;' as the second or third character in the mode argument), both input and output may be performed on the associated stream. However, writes cannot be followed by reads without an intervening call to &lt;code&gt;fflush&lt;/code&gt; or to a file positioning function (&lt;code&gt;[[fseek]]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fsetpos&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;[[Rewind (C)|rewind]]&lt;/code&gt;), and reads cannot be followed by writes without an intervening call to a file positioning function.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/fopen.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing and appending modes will attempt to create a file of the given name, if no such file already exists. As mentioned above, if this operation fails, &lt;code&gt;fopen&lt;/code&gt; will return &lt;code&gt;[[Null pointer|NULL]]&lt;/code&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Clark, Randall Baldwin. “Geriatrics.” The Law Most Beautiful and Best: Medical Argument and Magical Rhetoric in Plato’s Laws. New York: Lexington Books, 2003. 71—88. {{PAGENAME}}


Clark’s book uses historical research about Ancient Greek medical practices in order to better understand Plato’s rhetorical philosophy in Laws. One of Plato’s latest works, Laws imagines an Athenian explaining to a Cretan and Spartan why the highest purpose of legislation is not to ensure victory in war, but the good of the people, and that the best legislation garners citizen compliance without the use of brute force. In order to achieve this, magistrates must write laws which not only demand order, but persuade their citizens to abide by it of their own free will, just as a good physician artfully dialogues with and gently persuades a patient toward better health and medical treatment (Plato 719—720). 


In the chapter titled “Geriatrics,” Clark argues that Plato’s rhetoric is “medicinal” in three ways. First, unlike in the Gorgias where Socrates equates rhetoric with a false form of health and healing, in Laws Plato depicts the doctor as the paragon of persuasion, showing that his healing art is dependent on his rhetorical art, and bedside manner. In this way, the Athenian shows that Legislation too, is dependent on the art of persuasion. Second, Clark outlines how the Athenian’s own rhetoric follows a Hippocratic model of medicine, by beginning with dialogical questioning, speaking affably with the patient and his friend, and providing a prescription for the sickness only after he has brought his patient along in happy agreement. In this way, Clark says, Plato appeals to the historical moment in which Hippocratic, or technical, medicine began to revolutionize Greek culture: “artful rather than capricious . . . persuasive rather than forceful, . . . the Hippocratic physician . . . soon became the standard for the enlightened rule of one man over his fellows . . . Sophists, philosophers, statesmen, and their ilk—all attempted to appropriate the cachet to their respective endeavors. . . . technical medicine became the very model for the arts of rhetoric, education, philosophy and politics” (76-77).

      <text xml:space="preserve">I thought I'd use this space to provide a little bit of commentary about Clark, aside from the summary:
 
Clark makes the ancient blunder of correlating “persuasion” with the rational and with technical medicine, and “rhetoric” with the irrational healing of pharmacon. This is not born out in Plato’s example of the ideal “good physician,” whose dominant characteristic is his freedom, as opposed to the slave physician who has no choice but to work, and is therefore brutal and rude to his (also enslaved) patients. This is not a difference between reason and non-reason, but between artful rhetoric and none, monetary motive and lack of monetary motive, ethic and lack of ethic. However, Clark’s in-depth research into the philosophy and practices of classical medicine, as well as the major impact it had on all forms of public discourse is very valuable, and worth the read.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Depression is a mood disorder whereby feelings of sadness, unhappiness, gloom, hopelessness, despair, loss, misery, and discouragement last for a long time and interrupt daily activities. It is caused by the chemical changes in the brain and stressful life events. Certain medications served for various treatments alter brain chemicals that lead to depression. For example, Accutane, which is prescribed for the treatment of severe acne, can cause depression.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Nausea is a feeling of unbalance, unease and discomfort in the stomach with an urge to vomit. Vomiting is an accidental or intentional force  to throw up stomach contents through the mouth in order to get back the balance of the stomach. Many drugs used for different treatments also cause nausea as an adverse effect such as opiates, metronidazole as well as a side effect such as antibiotics, and anti-parasitic agents. Nausea is usually associated with indigestion, upper GI tract complaints such as bloating, early satiety, and difficulty swallowing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Generally, a pulmonary rehabilitation exercise program will be prescribed based on the results from the initial assessment. A physiotherapist will recommend the type, intensity, length and frequency of exercise the patient should do (22). A normal session will include a warm-up, followed by some aerobic exercise, some strengthening exercises for the arms and legs and a cool down (22).


Aerobic exercises may include some walking, cycling or stepping. Walking is the most widely used as it is used in may Activities of Daily Life (22).


One study found that supervised, progressed walk training resulted in significantly greater increases in endurance capacity compared to supervised, progressed cycle training in people with COPD (19). This is a significant finding as walk training is simple, readily available, and required no equipment.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hypertension is a disease known to affect the blood pressure within the body and is associated with all cause mortality, strokes, coronary artery disease, heart failure, peripheral arterial disease and renal insufficiency. &lt;ref name=&gt; Fagard, R. H (2011). Exercise therapy in hypertension and cardiovascular disease,''Exercise and Cardiovascular Disease 53''(6),404-411&lt;/ref&gt;
Hypertension is a term used to describe high blood pressure within the body. Blood pressure is a measurement of the force against the walls of your arteries as your heart pumps blood through your body.&lt;ref name= &quot;Medline Plus&quot;&gt; Medline PLus (2011). ''Hypertension''. Retrieved from U.S National Library of Medicine website:http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000468.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The universal diagnosis for hypertension is a systolic blood pressure of 140mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure of 90mmHg. It is known to have a high prevalence in those aged 50 years and older although there is an increasing presence within younger years.
Treatment for hypertension is often anti-hypertensive drugs along with lifestyle changes like increasing daily exercise. Many of the common anti-hypertensive drugs have adverse effects on the body, which are important to consider when exercising, as this is another major form of treatment.

=== Causes of Hypertension &lt;ref name=&gt; Maireb, E.N., &amp; Hoehn, K (2007). ''Human Anatomy and Physiology'' (7th ed.)San Francisco, CA: Pearson Education Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;===
There are no underlying causes for hypertension, however the following factors are believed to be involved:
* Obesity
* Frequent stress or anxiety
* Excess alcohol (more than one drink per day for women and more than two drinks per day for men)
* Increased salt in diet
* Family history of high blood pressure
* Diabetes
* Smoking

=== Treatment for Hypertension &lt;ref name=&gt; Gordon, N. F. (2003). ''Hypertension- Exercise Management for persons with chronic diseases and disabilities.'' Champaigne, IL: Human Kinetics &lt;/ref&gt; ===
Exercise prescription for improving VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max is also found to be effective in lowering blood pressure in hypertensive individuals. In addition is it also recommended that individuals:
* Modify diet (i.e. decreasing sodium intake)
* Reduce weight by increasing daily exercise
* Limit alcohol consumption
* Pharmacotherapy

|| As heart rate will not increase despite increase in work load it is recommended that a target heart rate is not used during exercise rather a rate of perceived exertion.

Therefore it is recommended to monitor heart post exercise and appropriately prepare for weather conditions.

|| Calcium channel blockers decrease an individuals tolerance to exercise by blocking the amount of calcium entering the heart muscle. Exercise for patients on this drug should perform at low-moderate intensities, as they are incapable of performing high intensity exercise due to lack of calcium. These individuals are also at risk of developing post exercise hypotension.

=== Recommendations ===
For athletes who are participating in recreational sports it is recommended that they treat their hypertension with ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers. These anti-hypertensive drugs prove to have the least adverse effects during exercise.&lt;ref name=&gt; Wallace, J.P. 2003. Exercise in hypertension-a clinical review. ''Sports Medicine, 33'',585-598 &lt;/ref&gt;
The [http://www.heartfoundation.org.au/information-for-professionals/Clinical-Information/Pages/hypertension.aspx/ Heart Foundation] suggests 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity on most, if not all, days of the week.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Asthma?==
Over 2 million Australians are diagnosed with asthma.&lt;ref name=TAF&gt;{{cite web|title=Foundation, The Asthma Foundation. Understanding Asthma. Asthma Foundation Australia.|url=http://www.asthmafoundation.org.au/What_is_asthma.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that occurs when the bronchi passageway of the lungs narrow causing breathing to become difficult.&lt;ref name=ACSM&gt;Durstine, J Larry, et al. ACSM's- Exercise Management for Persons with Chronic Diseases and Disabilities. s.l. : ASCM, 2009. pp. 143-149. 0-7360-7433-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Hyper responsiveness of the bronchi smooth muscles lead to the cause of asthma.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESSA&quot;&gt;Australian Association for Exercise and Sports Science position statement on Exercise and Asthma. Morton, Alan R and Fitch, Kenneth D. 2011, Vol. 14, pp. 312-316. 0.1016/j.jsams.2011.02.009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asthma when participating in Cardio exercise?==
Asthma can be a limiting factor for not participating in physical activity.&lt;ref name=EIB&gt;Exercise-induced Bronchocontriction and the drug used in its treatment. Vidal, Carmen and Armisen, Margarita. 2, Vol. 3, pp. 1-10..&lt;/ref&gt; All asthmatics are encouraged to participate in normal physical activity once their asthma is controlled.&lt;ref name=&quot;EIB&quot;/&gt;

If an asthmatic has asthmatic episode whilst exercising this is called Exercise Induced Asthma (EIA) or Bronchospasm (EIB)&lt;ref name=PDF&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia, Asthma. A Guide to using asthma medications and Devices. Asthama Australia.|accessdate=March 2011|url=http://www.asthmaaustralia.org.au/files/medications.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 40%- 90% of all asthmatics will suffer from EIA during their life.&lt;ref name=PDF/&gt;

The key to participating in exercise is control.

==Exercise and Ventolin==
Ventolin (salbutamol) is a short acting Beta2-agonist which causes the smooth muscles surrounding the Bronchi to relax.)&lt;ref name=ESSA/&gt; Ventolin takes approximately 4 minutes to relieve the effects of an asthmatic episode and lasts between 6-8 hours making it suitable for controlling Asthma whilst exercising.&lt;ref name=PFIZER&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia, Pfizer. Salbutamol Inhalation Solution. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners.|date=January 16, 2006|accessdate=October 11, 2011|url=http://www.racgp.org.au/cmi/pucsalbu.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is recommend that Ventolin be used 10-15 minutes before exercise. &lt;ref name=ESSA/&gt; It is also recommended that you use Ventolin whilst exercising if you start to feel an onset of an asthma attack. (See symptoms above) &lt;ref name=EIB/&gt;

==How to control your Asthma whilst exercising?==

-'''Preparing for exercise'''&lt;ref name=ESSA/&gt;
*Ensure your asthma is well managed, by having a asthma action plan in case of an attack
*Use Ventolin 10-15 minutes before exercise
*Commence physical activity with a light warm up consisting of rhythmic light exercise (walking or jogging) followed by stretching.
*Ensure you are well hydrated before exercising.

==What to do if you have an asthmatic episode whilst exercising?&lt;ref name=VIC&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia, Asthma. A Guide to using asthma medications and Devices. Asthama Australia. |date=March 2011|accessdate=October 11, 2011|url=http://www.asthmaaustralia.org.au/files/medications.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
*Stop what you are doing and remain calm
*Follow you Asthma Action Plan devised by your local GP
*If you don’t have an asthma action plan, take 4 separated puffs of your inhaler and wait 4 minutes. 
*If the inhaler has not relieved your asthma take another 4 separated puffs and wait another 4 minutes.
*If your reliever still has no effect call an ambulance.
*Remain calm and continue to use your inhaler 4 puffs every 4 minutes.
*If your asthma is controlled again recommence the physical activity

==Side Effects of using Ventolin&lt;ref name=TAF/&gt;==

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
:A commitment device is a choice that an individual makes in the present which restricts his own set of choices in the future, often as a means of controlling future impulsive behavior and limiting choices to those that reflect long-term goals. Typically, in order to classify as a commitment device, two conditions must be satisfied: (1) The decision does not have any type of strategic purpose with respect to others. (2) The person would pay something (on the margin) and make it more expensive in the present, even if he or she received no other benefit from the payment. &lt;ref name = &quot;reference three&quot;&gt;Bryan, Gharad, Dean Karlan, and Scott Nelson. &quot;Commitment Devices.&quot; Annual Review of Economics 2.1 (2010): 671-98. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
:Humans have always used commitments devices, sometimes unwittingly, in at least one form or another. Only more recently, however, have economists come to define and study this type of device in depth. Thomas Schelling, a pioneer in the fields of Game Theory and Behavioral Economics, was one of the first economists to write about them at length. In 1960, Schelling clarified the usefulness of commitment devices with his famous 'kidnapper's dilemma.' The dilemma arises when a kidnapper has a change of heart and wants to release his victim, but is unable to because there is no way of guaranteeing the victim will not turn him into the police upon release. A  simple promise by the victim to not turn the kidnapper into the police is an insufficient guarantee for the kidnapper. The kidnapper knows that it will be in the victim's best interest to renege on the deal after he is let go. The solution to the dilemma lies in the form of a commitment device: &quot;if the victim has committed an act whose disclosure could lead to blackmail, he may confess it; if not, he might commit one in the presence of his captor, to create a bond that will ensure his silence.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;reference one&quot;&gt;Schelling, Thomas C.

Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Blackmail becomes the commitment device, binding the future actions of the victim before the kidnapper chooses to release him. Since the release of Schelling's seminal work, ''The Strategy of Conflict'', numerous economists have expanded upon his work and have formulated mathematical equations to model the effects of commitment devices.
 
==Time Inconsistency and Inter-temporal Choice==
:Inter-temporal choice is an economic term to describe the study of how consumption in one time period affects consumption in a future time period. Time inconsistency is the concept that a person has different selves in distinct time periods that do not agree on a single best course of action for that person to take. Time inconsistency leads to the idea that there is a 'general self' and multiple 'everyday selves,' with each self making different choices to pursue its own view of the person's best interest. Commitment devices are based on a fusion of inter-temporal choice and time inconsistency, as they allow a self in one time period to restrict the set of choices available to future selves.

:The dual-self model of humans, as articulated by Drew Fudenberg and David Levine, is one of the most recent takes on the 'multiple selves' concept.&lt;ref name = &quot;reference two&quot;&gt;Fudenberg, Drew, and David K. Levine. &quot;A Dual-Self Model of Impulse Control.&quot; American Economic Review 96.5 (2006): 1449-476. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Fudenberg and Levine argue that there exist two &quot;selves&quot; spanning a given time frame. The self at time 0 has different preferences than the self at time 1 (the time at which an event is occurring or a decision must be made). The self at time 0 tends to value long-term benefits more than short-term ones. Conversely, the self at time 1, influenced by its environment and the pressure of short-term desires, chooses preferences that may be harmful in the long run, but desirable in the short run. In order to overcome these conflicting preferences, the self at time 0 can use a commitment device to limit the choices available to the self at time 1, therefore changing its preferences to match those of the self at time 0.

==Commitment Devices and Poverty==
:Economists at Yale, led by Dean Karlan, believe commitment devices could be useful in combating poverty traps, or the phenomenon where increases in income result in a loss of benefits, leaving an individual no better off than he was before the change in income.&lt;ref name = &quot;reference three&quot;&gt;Bryan, Gharad, Dean Karlan, and Scott Nelson. &quot;Commitment Devices.&quot; Annual Review of Economics 2.1 (2010): 671-98. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; They argue it is more difficult for poor people to consume responsibly in the short term because their basket of goods contains a disproportionate amount of temptation goods. In this context, a temptation good is operationally defined as a good that satisfies a short-term craving, but offers no long-term utility to its consumer. Economists have found that as income increases, the proportion of income spent on temptation goods decreases. This is illustrated by the example of consumption of two different goods: candy (temptation good) and houses (durable goods). It is assumed that most people like candy and, since candy is a cheap temptation good, that poor and rich alike choose to consume it. But as income increases, consumers are able to buy more durable goods, like houses, which are classified as non-temptation goods. Clearly the amount a consumer spends on candy will be negligible when compared to the amount he spends on a house, and therefore the proportion of income spent on temptation goods decreases as income increases. Commitment devices, such as Rotating Savings and Credit Associations, offer a way for the poor to break out of poverty traps and increase their well being.

==Commitment Devices and the IMF==
The International Monetary Fund acts as a commitment device for countries to commit to their government policies. In order for countries to borrow from others, they usually need to change their policies to fit the standards of the IMF in order to receive the financial resources they wish to gain. The IMF acts a contract for such transactions because, as a well-recognized organization, the press follows activity within the IMF. With the media following the countries involved in these deals, the press can expose a country when they don’t abide by their government policies &lt;ref name=&quot;Fang&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last = Fang|first = Songying|title = Subtle Signals, Limited Device: International Institutions and Credible Commitment of Non-democracies|year = 2010|type = manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Bad publicity is generated from a country’s inability to uphold their agreement on enacting changes in their policies. This bad publicity can lead to long-term effects on the country such as having a hard time forming trade agreements and attracting foreign investment as well as the leaders of these countries will often face consequences in upcoming elections &lt;ref name=&quot;Edward&quot;&gt;{{Citation| author = Edward D. Mansfield|author2 = Helen V. Milner|author3 = B. Peter Rosendorff|title = Why Democracies Cooperate More: Electoral Control and International Trade Agreements|year = 2002|type = journal MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A country demonstrates their credibility of their commitments by enacting reforms in their policies in exchange for financial help. This credibility then signals to other investors that the international community is in support of the country’s program in which they need funds&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashoka&quot;&gt;{{Citation|author = Ashoka Mody|author2 = Diego Saravia|title = Catalyzing Capital Flows: Do IMF-Supported Programs Work as Commitment Devices?|year = 2003|type = working paper|url = http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2003/wp03100.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This is especially important for non-democratic countries seeking financial help from democratic countries &lt;ref name=&quot;Fang&quot;/&gt;. The commitment device is not only that a country sticks to its policies, but also that the IMF supplies the resources necessary in order to serve as an alternative for a country’s reserves &lt;ref name= &quot;Ashoka&quot;/&gt;.

==Commercialization==
:Dean Karlan commercialized commitment devices with the launch of stickK.com in 2008.&lt;ref name = &quot;reference four&quot;&gt;&quot;An Idea for Lent: Carrot and StickK.&quot; The Economist. The Economist Newspaper Limited, 7 Feb. 2008. Web. 20 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.economist.com/node/10661442&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The site takes advantage of the the low transaction costs afforded by the Internet to create and execute &quot;commitment contracts.&quot; To complete a commitment contract, a StickK user picks a goal he wants to achieve, sets a time limit for achieving it, chooses stakes that will be lost if he does not complete the goal, and invites friends and family to referee his contract. The purpose of these contracts is to increase the short-term financial costs of quitting on a long-term goal, thus making it more likely that a user will complete his goal. StickK makes money off this arrangement by taking a cut of the stakes. As of October 21, 2011, 113,340 contracts have been made on StickK, totaling more than $8,000,000 in value.&lt;ref name = &quot;reference five&quot;&gt;StickK. StickK.com. Web. 21 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://stickk.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classic Example==
The classic example of a commitment device, and the one frequently cited as the first on record, is the tale of Odysseus ordering his men to lash his body to the mast of the ship so he would be able to hear the sirens' song without jumping overboard. Odysseus' choice to be tied to the mast of the ship is his 'present' choice. That choice restricted his future choices, preventing him from impulsively jumping overboard. By using a commitment device, Odysseus was able to achieve his goal of hearing the sirens' song without jumping ship, a decision that would not have been in his long-term self-interest.

==Examples==
* Buying long-term gym memberships, as opposed to single day passes
* Cutting up credit cards to avoid shopping binges
* Checking into rehab to avoid habitual drug use
* Deciding to give something up for Lent
* Leaving work at the office, so it cannot be done at home
* Buying junk food in small packages, rather than in bulk
* Not keeping alcohol in the house, to prevent consumption&lt;ref name = &quot;reference three&quot;&gt;Bryan, Gharad, Dean Karlan, and Scott Nelson. &quot;Commitment Devices.&quot; Annual Review of Economics 2.1 (2010): 671-98. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Welcome message ==
Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer since things work a little different here.
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you have questions, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(This is not an automated message, I'll be watching during a time for any reply you make to it...)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 05:28, 26 October 2011 (UTC)

== Rejection of change - C Programming ==
Just to explain the rejection of the change. There was no obvious need to make the information evident (most other functions share the same parameter), if at all needed it should be made on the first function that uses it or on every one. It also broke letter case, and added a broken wikilink.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 05:27, 26 October 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Virtual Account Numbers==
[[File:Smartcard2.png|100px|thumb|left]]
One of the main concerns with e-commerce is security issues, especially for consumers paying with credit cards.  Many consumers are afraid that their credit card information may be stolen by hackers.  To help consumers with this concern, many credit card companies are offering virtual account numbers to their customers.  Virtual account numbers are disposable numbers linked to your account that can be good for only one transaction, or until you cancel the number.  These numbers can't be used for transactions such as hotel stays, where you have to physically show your credit card for the final purchase.



'''Digital Wallets'''
[[File:AnaglyphNYC.jpg|100px|thumb|Add Monochrome image using a digital image processing computer program:) ]]

These are sometimes referred to as e-wallets offer customers a convenient way of storing information such as online payment account information, credit card information, website passwords, shipping and billing information etc., that is needed on a regular basis. Digital wallets are available as both stand-alone programs and online services. The information in Digital wallets are protected by a password and the necessary checkout information is transferred either manually or automatically to the online order form, as it is needed.

Digital wallet programs are available for both conventional personal computers and mobile phones; an iPhone digital wallet. Some digital wallets include a feature that automatically supplies information such as username and password whenever that information is needed for sites that the user specifies in the digital wallet program. Some digital wallets include a feature that automatically supplies information such as username and password whenever that information is needed for sites that the user specifies in the digital wallet program. Other digital wallets include a menu option to copy the appropriate information such as a credit card number or shipping address to the appropriate location on a web form as needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Chapter 8

[[File:Enzyme model.tiff|thumb| enzyme model ]]

== 1. Properties of enzymes (catalytic power and its specificity)==
a. Enzymes are mainly proteins that usually catalyze a single chemical reaction or a set of closely related reactions. 
b. it has active site so that it can bind to specific reactant, substrate. 
C. they enhance reaction rates. 
D. they require cofactors for catalysis. 
E. enzyme can transfer one form of energy into another form. During the photosynthesis, enzyme will capture the sun light; the light energy is converted into chemical bond energy or in the mitochondria energy from small molecules is converted into chemical energy in the form of ATP. 

To give you more details about enzyme properties...

There is another important enzymatic function which is enzymes may also transform energy from on form into another.
it is common case that energy of the reaction is converted with high efficiency into a different form.
as an example in biochemistry, the energy from the sun light can be converted to free energy saved in the mitochondria. in this step, enzymes may be needed; enzyme myosin converts the energy of ATP into the mechanical energy of contracting muscles. pumps in the meberanes of cells and organelles, which can be thought of as enzymes that move substrates rather than chemically altering them, creat chemical and electrical gradients by using the energy of ATP to transport molecules and ions. 



== Examples of enzymes, ==
a.	Proteases: it catalyze the cleavage of the peptide bond (hydrolysis of peptide bond) 
&lt;facilitating a difficult reaction&gt;
it is importnat to remember that there is protein turnover in system. in order to server this, protein must be degratded so that their constituent amino acids can be recycled for the synthesis of new proteins.
likewise, protein you had this morning must be ingested, which means it should be broken down into small peptides and amino acids so that it can be absorbed in your body. here is where the proteases needed.
enzyme proteases cleave protiens by a hydrolysis reaction, which means there is a addition of a molecule of water to a peptide bond
even though the reaction of peptide bond breaking mechanism is thermodynamically favored, such hydrolysis reaction are extremly slow, which is why we need an enzyme to make the reaction goes faster.
There are three residue in this enzyme but the serine residue is the most highly reactive site in this enzyme.
 
b.	Carbonic anhydrase can hydrate a million molecules of carbon dioxide in one second. Even hydration of carbon dioxide is catalyzed by an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase

==Classification of enzymes==
1.	Oxidoreductases: transfer of electrons (hydride ions or H atoms)
2.	Transferases: group transfer reactions
3.	Hydrolases: hydrolysis reactions (transfer of functional groups to water)
4.	Lyases: addition of groups to double bonds, or formation of double bonds by removal of groups
5.	Lsomerases: transfer of groups within molecules to yield isomeric forms
6.	Ligases: formation of c-c, c-s, c-o, and c-n bonds by condensation reactions coupled to ATP cleavage. 


== Cofactors (not protein)==
[[File:Snapshot 2011-11-30 20-46-22.tiff|thumb| cofactor ]]

Many enzymes require cofactors for activity, it helps reaction carry out
a.	metal ion
b.	small organic molecules (called coenzyme, many times derived from vitamins)
enzyme with out cofactor called apoenzyme; enzyme with cofactor is called holoenzyme 
coenzyme with tightly bond to enzyme called prosthetic group; coenzyme loosely bond to enzyme called cosubstrates. 

Enzymes are highly specific catalysts. the catalysits in biological systems are enzymes, and nearly all enzymes are proteins. enzymes are highly specific and have great catalytic power. they can enhance reaction rates. Like i stated earlier, cofactors can be metal ions or small, vitamin-derived organic molecules, which is called coenzyme. 

based on what they catalyze, enzymes can be classified and many enzymes have common names that provide little information about reactions that they catalyze. for example. a proteolytic enzyme secreted by the pancreas is called trypsin. most other enzymes are named for their substrates and for the reactions that they catalyze, with the suffix &quot;ase&quot; added. thus, an ATPase is an enzyme that breaks down ATP, whereas APT synthesis is an enzyems that synthesizes ATP.
reactions are divided into six major groups numbered from 1 to 6. these groups were subdivided and further subdivided, so that  four-digit number preceded by the letters EC for enzymes commission could precisely identifiy all enzymes.

== Free energy in enzymatic reactions== 
a.	Free energy(delta G) provides information about the spontaneity of a reaction but it doesn’t explain the rate of reaction. 
b.	It is independent of path ways. 
1st. delta G is negative
=rxn spontaneous. (exergonic)
2nd. Delta G is zero
=rxn is at equilibrium (no overall movement)
3rd. delta G is positive 
=rxn is non-spontaneous (endorgonic)
[[File:Exergonic.pdf|thumb|diagram of exergonic reaction ]]



[[File:Endergonic.pdf|thumb|diagram of endergonic reaction ]]


== Transition state==
It is defined as the state corresponding to the highest energy of the reaction. And it can be lower as the enzyme catalyzes the reaction. It is a way of determining the rate of reaction.  
-interaction of the enzyme and substrate at the active site promotes the formation of the transition state. In fact, the active site lower the transition stat and it makes the reaction goes faster. 
catalytic antibodies demonstrate the importance of selective binding of the transition state to enzymatic activity.
antibodies that recognized transtion state should function as catalysts as long as the state that the transition state is the place where where the catalysis happens is correct. the preparation of an antibody that catalyzes the insertion of a metal ion into porphyrin incely illustrates the validity of this explanation. 
catalytic antibodies can indeed be produced by using transition-state analogs as antigens. 


== Enzyme-substrate complex==
there are 3 hypothetical models for describing enzyme-substrate complex
a.	lock-key model: one substrate binds to one active site of an enzyme.
b.	induced-fit model: active site forms a shape complementray to the subrat only after substrate bond. Enzyme may have more than one substrate as the substrate comes and it induces the enzyme.
c.	transition-state model:


== Regulatory strategies ==

Let’s study Regulatory Strategies: Enzymes and Hemoglobin 

In order for proteins and enzymes to work properly, they must be regulated by some factors.
There are 4 ways that the enzymatic reaction is regulated by.
1.	Allosteric control. Allosteric protein has the regulatory of many proteins.
It is not the same as the substrate bind to active site of an enzyme instead it binds to s site and it changes the conformational form of the enzyme. Thus the further reaction will not be preceded. 
With a help of small signal molecule, we can control the activity of the many proteins, which is significant. 

2.	Multiple forms of enzymes
As an example, there is a homologs enzyme called isozymes and it provides an avenue for varying regulation of the same reaction distinct locations or times. 
3.	Reversible covalent modification
Covalent attachment of modifying group often time alter many enzymes. ATP In this case, the ATp serves as the phosphoryl donor in the reaction, which is catalyzed by protein kinases. The protein kinases are enzymes that add a phosphate group to a protein. And it is called phosphorylation. The removal of phosphoryl groups by hydrolysis is catalyzed by protein phosphatases. 
4.	Proteolytic activation.
There is an enzyme controlled in a cycle between active and inactive states. 
Many enzymes are activated by the hydrolysis of a few or even one peptide bond by zymogenes or proenzymes.
How does the Aspartate transcarbomoylase is inhibited by the end product of its pathway?
In the first step of biosynthesis of pyrimidines, there is a aspartate transcarbamoylase catalyzation. It is mainly the condensation of aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate to form N-carbamoylaspartate and orthophosphate. ATCase catalyzes in the pathway that will ultimately yield pyrimidine nucleotides such as CTP.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Do you have any sources that say Marco Polo did not go to China? I'm curious, many textbooks cite Marco Polo going to China, and his works. I know there was a debate about it for a while, but I thought it had been settled: https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/41883/1/Marcopolo.html [[User:Hethrir|Hethrir]] ([[User talk:Hethrir|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Hethrir|contribs]]) 22:59, 20 October 2011 (UTC)

:My understanding of the situation is that it is unprovable that Marco Polo, as the author and personage in the book, existed at all. Analysis made on the book have demonstrated that it is an aggregation of several authors and some of the related facts are pure fantasy or incorrect. In regard to this national heroes, it becomes impossible to establish veracity of facts especially considering the age. Even Columbus  nationality is disputed. In this book the fact is irrelevant I just didn't see a value in promoting one side of the story like it was on the wikipedia article.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:35, 20 October 2011 (UTC)
:: That is quite a sweeping assertion, and I can find no sources to justify it.  Can you please provide some links?--&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 11pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Arthurvogel|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;Arthur &lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Arthurvogel|&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;Vogel&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:36, 21 October 2011 (UTC)
:::Sorry don't have links, but the even the link Hethrir provided already lists those possibilities and the rest can even be inferred by the Wikipedia article on [[w:The Travels of Marco Polo]]. I got the information from a video documentary but can't remember the title. my recollection is that they performed analysis on the text of the existing copy (note that it is a copy and the book predates the printing press).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 19:53, 21 October 2011 (UTC)
:::: The link seems clear enough.  &quot;In her book Did Marco Polo Go To China? (first published by Secker &amp; Warburg, London, in 1995), Dr Frances Wood claims that Marco did not go to China ... All F.W.'s arguments have been discussed in detail and refuted in Igor de Rachewiltz's review-article&quot;.  In my experience, these documentaries like to promote such sensational fringe theories, so that people wil be interested in them.  Few will care to watch a documentary that says &quot;there is a crackpot who says so-and-so, but we can easily disprove this&quot; unless the theory is extremely well-known and popular, when the debunking is itself sensational.  Against that, I could easily post plenty of links, apparently more recent than 1995, that do not mention this theory.--&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 11pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Arthurvogel|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;Arthur &lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Arthurvogel|&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;Vogel&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:31, 21 October 2011 (UTC)
:::::The fact remains that what I said continues to be valid. There is no original version of the work or conclusive prof for any of the thesis. The copies that exist have errors and even some fantasy in them, this attacks the credibility of the tale being told. Historically the silk road existed long before Marco Polo, to expect him to be the first to embark on that voyage makes it also extremely unlikely. Then there is the objective of the work itself what was its purpose in the context it was created. All this factors alone makes a good case.
:::::For what matters this information is not important to the subject being covered (I could as well have removed it all, and probably will reedit it soon) I was just adding the other side to the statement that was present on the original article, to what presentation I disagreed, the objective is to keep it all NPOV under the scope of the book.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 20:47, 21 October 2011 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Effects of Exercise on Smoking Induced COPD ==

=== Background - What is COPD? ===

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is defined by the Global Obstructive Lung Disease group as a disease state charachterised by airflow limitation that is '''not fully reversible''' The air flow limitation is usually '''progressive''' and associated with an '''abnormal inflammatory response''' of the lungs to noxious particles or gases. COPD usually presents in mid-life (around 40 years and onwards) with slowly progressive symptoms 

=== The Issue - Explanation of COPD ===
* The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that there are presently 1.1 billions smokers worldwide and that this figure will increase to 1.6 billion by 2025 in low and middle-income countries.
* In the year 2000 there was an estimated 2.74 millions deaths worldwide from COPD alone.
* COPD currently affects over 2 million Australians.
* COPD is the leading cause of death in the Australian population (4th for males, 6th for females) and was responsible for 5,152 deaths in 2007.
* In 1990, COPD was ranked 12th as a burden of disease and this is projected to reach 5th by 2020.
* In the US COPD has an estimated 15% prevalence in those aged over 65 years and accounts for 20% of hospitalisations of older people.

==== Forms of COPD ====
COPD can generally be classified into one of two groups:
===== Chronic Bronchitis =====
Chronic Bronchitis is a recurrent problem, defined as the presence of cough and sputum production for at least 3 months in each of 2 consecutive years. The condition reduces the diameter of the airways through a combination of airway inflammation and overproduction of mucus. Chronic bronchitis is more prevalent in women than in men.

===== Emphysema =====
Emphysema is defined as the abnormal and permanent enlargement of air spaces distal to the terminal bronchioles accompanied with destruction of their walls. In emphysema, the [[/alveoli/]] are gradually destroyed so people have difficulty absorbing enough oxygen. The [[/bronchi/]] become inelastic and narrow making it harder to breathe in and out. It is widely accepted that, smoking is the most common cause of emphysema. It is also most prevalent among men aged over 65 years.

'''COPD is usually classified by severity, from mild to moderate to severe.'''
==== Mild COPD ====
Symptoms may only include the need to cough up mucus each morning. Symptoms such as shortness of breath, coughing or coughing up mucus might only occur during winter or after a cold. 
==== Moderate COPD ====
Symptoms are present in Mild COPD are observed almost every day, including feeling out of breath after exertion such as walking quickly, having trouble doing every day chores as a result of breathlessness, and it may take several weeks to recover from a cold or chest infection.
==== Severe COPD ====
All of the above symptoms will be present every day and shortness of breath will be present during normal daily activities such as taking a shower or getting the mail.

== Causes ==

==== Who is at risk? ====
* Smokers - Cigarette smoking is the main cause of COPD development. Smoking is thought to release enzyme that damage a protein called elastin, which makes the lungs less elastics when breathing in and out.
* Individuals exposed to pollutants in the workplace - COPD can also occur in people who have had long-term exposure to things that irritate your lungs, like certain chemicals, dust, or fumes in the workplace. Occupational exposure may be responsible for 20-30% of COPD cases. Heavy or long-term exposure to second-hand smoke or other air pollutants may also contribute to COPD.
* AAT Deficiency - In some, COPD is caused by a genetic condition known as alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency. People with this condition can devleop COPD without ever having smoked or had long-term exposure to harmful pollutants. In these susceptible individuals, exposure to harmful gases or particles can result in chronic inflammation with tissue injury, ineffective repair and structural changes. 
* Females - Some studies have shown that women may be at a greater risk of developing COPD. This may due to smaller lungs and airways and more sensitive airways.

=== Diagnosis ===
Indicators of COPD include:
* ''Chronic Cough:'' Present intermittently or every day, throughout the day.
* ''Chronic Sputum Production:'' Any pattern of chronic sputum production.
* ''Acute Bronchitis:'' Repeated episodes.
* ''[[/Dyspnea/]] (shortness of breath) that is:'' Progressive, persistent, worse with exercise, and worse during respiratory infections.
* ''History of Exposure to Risk Factors:'' Including tobacco smoke, occupational dusts and chemicals, smoke from home cooking and heating fuel e.g. coal.
'''Note:''' Please note that diagnosis should always be confirmed by [[/'''Spirometry'''/]]

=== Recommendations - How to Manage COPD ===
While there is '''no cure''' for COPD and the airway damage cannot be repaired, all the symptoms can be reduced by following certain management strategies. Including:

*Prevent disease progression i.e. stop smoking - only smoking cessation and oxygen therapy (in significant [[/hypoxaemia/]]) have shown improved mortality in COPD.
*Relieve symptoms
*'''Improve exercise tolerance'''
* Improve health status
* Prevent and treat complications
* Prevent and treat exacerbations - managing exacerbations involves a combination of [[/short-acting bronchodilators/]], [[/systemic corticosteroids/]], and when needed, antibiotics.
* Reduce mortality, and
* Prevent or minimize side effects from treatment

==== The Importance of Exercise for the COPD Patient ====

Weakness, shortness of breath, and even the fear of breathlessness can cause people with COPD to avoid physical activity. This cycle of weakness, shortness of breath, and inactivity contributes to a progressive decline in muscle strength and inefficient oxygen use, making it difficult for some patients to perform day-to-day activities, such as showering and dressing. As such, exercise is now recognised as an integral part of managing COPD and while it won't change the underlying structural problems in the lungs, it noes have a number of important benefits.

'''Exercise Increases:'''                   
* Energy levels 
* Muscle strength, endurance and efficiency 
* [[/Cardiopulmonary endurance/]]         
* Restful sleep, and                        
* Bone density                            
* Independence 
* Quality of Life 
* Assist in weight control 

'''Exercise Decreases:'''
* Shortness of breath 
* Risk factors of heart disease
* Blood pressure
* Anxiety and depression 
* Blood sugar levels, and
* Desire to smoke
- Exercise appears to be an effective non-pharmacological method of reducing cigarette cravings and desire to smoke during temporary abstinence from smoking

==== How Often Should I Exercise? ====
Those with COPD should aim to exercise for a minimum of 3 sessions per week, for at least 20 to 30 minutes per session. It has been found that patients with COPD who exericse for more than 2 hours per week can improve their health

==== What Intensity of exercise should I be Doing? ====
The Australian Lung Foundation recommends that COPD sufferers should exercise between levels three and four on the [[/Modified Borg Dyspnea Scale/]], somewhere between 'Moderate' and 'Somewhat severe'. Exercise should be undertaken at 60% of your maximal heart rate. You DO need to push yourself into  minor breathlessness in order to adapt and increase exercise tolerance.

- Moderate exercise was shown to have a delayed effect on reducing the withdrawal symptoms of restlessness, stress, tension and poor concentration, relative to light exercise, at 5 min or 10 min post-exercise

- A program of supervised vigorous exercise is associated with long-term maintenance of smoking cessation in females.

==== What Type of Exercise Should I be Doing? ====
Those with COPD should be looking to undertake '''aerobic activity''' to build endurance and '''resistance training''' to strengthen muscles. Good aerobic activities include walking, cycling, stair climbing, and aquatic exercises. Resistance exercise involves the use of free weights, special resistance bands, or resistance machines.</text>

== Background - What is COPD? ==
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is defined by the Global Obstructive Lung Disease group as a disease state characterized by airflow limitation that is '''not fully reversible'''. The air flow limitation is usually '''progressive''' and associated with an '''abnormal inflammatory response''' of the lungs to harmful particles or gases. COPD usually presents in mid-life (around 40 years and onwards) and currently affects over 2 million Australians&lt;ref&gt;Malipatil, V. &amp; McDonald, C., F. Management of Older People with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research. 39(4):302-6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;.
=== Causes === 
The 2 most prevalent causes of COPD are; '''smoking''' and '''environmental exposure''' to chemicals, dust or coal over many years[1].
=== Forms of COPD ===
COPD can generally be classified into one of two groups:
# Chronic Bronchitis - A recurrent problem, defined as the presence of cough and sputum production for at least 3 months in each of 2 consecutive years[1]. 
# Emphysema -  Defined as the abnormal and permanent enlargement of the air sacs of the lungs causing breathlessness and wheezing&lt;ref&gt;Moderate Exercise May Reduce Risk of COPD in Smokers. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. 175:458, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;.
=== Diagnosis ===
Indicators of COPD include:
* ''Chronic Cough:'' Present intermittently or every day, throughout the day.
* ''Chronic Sputum Production:'' Any pattern of chronic sputum production may indicate COPD.
* ''Acute Bronchitis:'' Repeated episodes.
* ''Dyspnea that is:'' Progressive, persistent, worse with exercise and respiratory infections.
* ''Exposure to Risk Factors:'' E.g. smoke, tobacco smoke, dusts and chemicals&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, C. Health Promotion for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Health Promotion. 30(6):472-474, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
== Recommendations - How to Manage COPD ==
While there is '''no cure''' for COPD and the airway damage cannot be repaired, all the symptoms can be reduced by following certain management strategies&lt;ref&gt;Queensland Health and The Australian Lung Foundation Better Living with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. A Patient Guide. www.lungnet.com.au 2008 [18/10/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;. Including:
1. Prevent disease progression; 2. Relieve symptoms; 3. '''Improve exercise tolerance'''; 4. Improve health status; 5. Prevent and treat complications; 6. Prevent and treat exacerbations; 7. Reduce mortality, and 8. Prevent or minimize side effects from treatment[3]. In fact, a study conducted by the University of Western Australia in 2008 found that those with COPD who completed an exercise program over 8 weeks had significant improvements in functional exercise capacity and a reduction in hospitalisation due to COPD exacerbations.
==== The Importance of Exercise for the COPD Patient ====
Weakness, shortness of breath, and even the fear of breathlessness can cause people with COPD to avoid physical activity. This cycle of weakness, shortness of breath, and inactivity contributes to a progressive decline in muscle strength and inefficient oxygen use, making it difficult for some patients to perform Activities of Daily Living&lt;ref&gt;Get Physical with COPD. wwww.HopkinsAfter50.com 2004 [18/10/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;. 
'''Exercise Increases:'''                   
1. Energy levels; 2. Muscle strength, endurance and efficiency; 3. Cardiopulmonary endurance; 4. Restful sleep; 5. Bone density; 6. Independence; 7. Quality of Life, and; 8. Assist in weight control [4][5]&lt;ref&gt;Watts, S. The Benefits of Pulmonary Rehabilitation. www.lungfoundation.com.au 2008 [18/10/2011]&lt;/ref&gt; 
'''Exercise Decreases:'''
1. Shortness of breath; 2. Risk factors of heart disease; 3. Blood pressure; 5. Anxiety and depression; 6. Blood sugar levels, and; 7. Desire to smoke[4][5][6]

==== How Often Should I Exercise? ====
Those with COPD should aim to exercise for a minimum of 3 sessions per week, for at least 20 to 30 minutes per session. People who have chronic lung conditions and who exercise regularly, such as walking or cycling for more than 2 hours per week can improve their health[4][5]
==== What Intensity of exercise should I be Doing? ====
Exercise should be undertaken at 60% of your maximal heart rate or moderate intensity. One way of measuring this is if you have trouble carrying on a converstation during exercise - You DO need to push yourself into  minor breathlessness in order to adapt and increase exercise tolerance [4][5]
==== What Type of Exercise Should I be Doing? ====
Those with COPD should be looking to undertake '''aerobic activity''' to build endurance and '''resistance training''' to strengthen muscles. Good aerobic activities include walking, cycling, stair climbing, and aquatic exercises. All forms of aerobic exercise is beneficial, however, a 2009 study conducted by the University of Sydney on aerobic exercise selection found that supervised, progressed walk training resulted in a significantly greater increase in endurance than the equivalent cycling training. Resistance exercise involves the use of free weights, special resistance bands, or resistance machines[5]

'''The Great Barrier Reef''' is a natural [[w:reef|reef]] system of the north-east coast of Australia. The reef is a collection of living organisms which consist of 2,900 reefs and 900 islands stretching for over 2,400 kilometres.  The Great Barrier Reef '''can be seen from Space'''.  It has been a World Heritage Site since 1981.

The site is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Australia.

[[File:First photo from space.jpg|400x320px|right|The first photos taken from space were taken on October 24, 1946 on the sub-orbital U.S.-launched V-2 rocket (flight #13) at White sands Missile Range. Photos were taken every second and a half. The highest altitude (65 miles, 105 km) was 5 times higher than any picture taken before.]]
We could state that the only function of space is to be filled. '''[[w:Space colonization|Space colonization]]''' is ultimately the only way to proceed, but still there are some that object to the idea.

The permanent autonomous (self-sufficient) [[w:human|human]] habitation of locations outside [[w:Earth|Earth]], would be an insurance against a global calamity, from a devastating war to the occurrence of a deadly plague, the collapse of the [[w:Ecosphere|ecosphere]] or a deadly asteroid impact to name just a few. Our blue planet is indeed a fragile home and as technology advances and the human population grows chances increase that a global catastrophe will strike humanity as it has struck other species before.  We should aim to escape being replaced as the dominant species or even becoming the last.

{{NOTE|Some could argue that by our permanence as the dominant species and by our own nature we could be preventing the emergence of other intelligences.}}

Space colonization has been fully achieved only in [[w:science fiction|science fiction]].  Most people will think of space colonies as being on the Moon or Mars while others will advocate that colonies will first be built in orbit, and envision huge space stations as depicted in the literature and movies.

The location of colonization can be:
* On a [[w:planet|planet]], [[w:natural satellite|natural satellite]], or [[w:asteroid|asteroid]]
* In orbit around the [[w:Earth|Earth]], [[Sun]],  [[w:Lagrangian point|Lagrangian point]] or other object

Or even a mix of the two. Humanity may find a way to transport a colony-sized population of men and women to another world, but the issue remains that each one of those people requires an amazing amount of supplies, that we here on Earth take for granted. Human space flight can be seen as prohibitively expensive, and much can be accomplished by automation and remote presence.

The issue of location and the different ways to proceed is a frequent point of contention between space colonization advocates. The way to go about colonizing outer-space has been researched and many ideas have been put forward, especially by science fiction authors, some may not even include the displacement of population from one location to another, but may consist only on a permanent remote presence, or in remotely creating &quot;life&quot; ''in situ''.

Some argue that moving beyond the solar system is totally impractical in any reasonable time scale. Even so there are plans being created for that eventuality. But that should not be the primary objective, ultimately our species will be forced to do so, if not for any other reason than that our Earth and Sun have an expiration date.

The anti-space arguments have gone so far as to suggest that space colonization is a remnant of historical colonization - it is (the idea at least) a lingering desire left over from the conquest of territory on earth. Indeed most of the ideas put forward have a logical connection to the human history regarding the colonization of new lands, with the added technological limitations and advances that a new endeavor would bring today.

Some also argue that space exploration wins the hearts and minds of voters but does little else, but in fact since the Space race during the cold war this notion does not seem to stand. It could be said that the objective of colonizing space adds fuel to the patriotic dogma of conquest, and thus reinforces negative national prejudice rather than helping to unify earth and so, the pragmatic argument to 'live together on the earth we have' is a powerful one, suggesting that if even half the money of space exploration were spent for terrestrial betterment, there would be greater good for a greater number of people, at least in the short term. But should one proposition exclude the other ?

As an alternative for the future of the human race, many science fiction writers have instead focused on the realm of the 'inner-space', that is the (computer aided) exploration of the human mind and human consciousness. Perhaps one example of this trend is the popular movie [[w:The Matrix|The Matrix]], where all the action takes place on (under the surface of) [[w:Earth|Earth]], and in a computer generated reality in [[w:cyberspace|cyberspace]]. However, this form of exploration need not be exclusive to space colonization, as exemplified by [[w:Transhumanist|Transhumanist]] philosophies.

Robotics and tele-presence seems a good start for the process of colonizing space but sadly after [[w:Lunokhod 1|Lunokhod 1]] in 1970 and 1971 with [[w:Mars 2|Mars 2]] and [[w:Mars 3|3]], only recently in 1997, did we get to do it again with the [[w:Mars Pathfinder|Mars Pathfinder]], that successfully exceeded expectations. It seems strange that a successful strategy can be moth-balled for so long, even in the [[w:International Space Station|International Space Station (ISS)]] only in 2011 was [[w:Robonaut|Robonaut]] been given a chance. It then becomes clear that there is a general administrative (and political) problem regarding mission planning in the USA. The problem with space program stall in the USSR/Russia was mainly economic in nature (leading to a political collapse), as the economic situation and political stability improves we may still be surprised.

In [[w:2001|2001]], the space news website [http://www.space.com ''SPACE.com''] asked [[w:Freeman Dyson|Freeman Dyson]], [[w:J. Richard Gott|J. Richard Gott]] and Sid Goldstein for reasons why some humans should live in space. Their respective answers were: (from http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/colonize_why_011008-1.html)
*To Spread Life and Beautify throughout the [[w:Universe|Universe]]
*To Ensure the Survival of Our Species
*To Make [[w:Money|Money]]
*Save the [[w:Environment|Environment]]
*Provide [[w:entertainment|entertainment]] value in order to distract from immediate surroundings

Louis J. Halle, formerly of the [[w:United States Department of State|United States Department of State]], wrote in ''[[w:Foreign Affairs|Foreign Affairs]]'' (Summer 1980) that the colonization of space will protect humanity in the event of global [[w:nuclear warfare|nuclear warfare]]. (see http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19800601faessay8146/louis-j-halle/a-hopeful-future-for-mankind.html)

The scientist [[w:Paul Davies|Paul Davies]] also supports the view that if a planetary catastrophe threatens the survival of the human species on Earth, a self-sufficient colony could &quot;reverse-colonize&quot; the Earth and restore human civilization.

The author and journalist William E. Burrows and the biochemist [[w:Robert Shapiro|Robert Shapiro]] proposed a private project, the [[w:Alliance to Rescue Civilization|Alliance to Rescue Civilization]], with the goal of establishing an off-Earth [[backup]] of human civilization.

Perhaps the most powerful justification is that colonization is employed by every successful species and civilization. Obviously, species with large, diverse habitats are less prone to extinction than those in a single niche. The Earth is a tiny fraction of the solar system, and an even smaller part of the galaxy. If life were to colonize the entire solar system via a system of tens of thousands of orbital colonies, and then send generation ships to nearby stars, it would become effectively immortal. It has been noted that life has colonized every livable niche on Earth. It would be surprising if, having developed the ability to do so, life failed to colonize the solar system.

Control of the solar system's resources will provide immense power and wealth to those who grasp it. Power and wealth are well known, effective motivators.

Sadly in the current state of affairs it is with some reason that people start to give credibility to the notion that man has never gone to the moon. The [[w:Moon landing|Moon landing]] was in 1969 and since 1972 we (humans) have never gone beyond Earth's orbit. Most of the human population alive today, did not experience the occasion in the necessary context. This will assuredly be the end of the phrase &quot;If they can put a man in the Moon why can't they...&quot;, since it is a fact that today we can not put a man on the moon. It would take a bit more than a decade to do it again. This and the fact that &quot;they&quot; (the Western governments) have lost much if not all of the reputation &quot;they&quot; had especially in the fields of management, applied science and economics, the most important fields on such endeavors. 

{{NOTE|NASA was created as a geopolitical instrument for the projection of power, more than a tool for the advancement of science.}}

Some people argue that there will not be ever again the same level of effort put behind human space presence like we saw in the [[w:Apollo program|Apollo program]]. That all that effort was the result of the [[w:Cold War|Cold War]]. Even considering the antagonism of the time, these arguments do not make sense, since at the time the US was already involved in a war, 1950-1973 [[w:Vietnam War|Vietnam War]] and no one, especially the US was expecting the collapse of the USSR. It is then necessary to consider other complementary motivations, beyond propaganda and projection of power, and look to the continued benefits from that technological event, that lead to the advancement of numerous technologies. 

With the decline of the USA supremacy, we are witnessing a downgrading of NASA (and even ESA), it is to be expected that the agencies will only support low cost projects and robotic programs fill that bill. China, the rising power has yet to build a space station (it has one programmed, [[w:Tiangong|Tiangong]]) so it will take some time for it to be able to step in as a leader in the field, even if China has also declared an interest in establishing a constant human presence on the moon. 

{{TODO|Add something about Russian provenience of China technology and mention the spying on the USA}}

Japan also was working in some advanced concepts, but the recent decline in its economy and stability seems bound to relegate it to a supporting role, much like Russia that lacks the political vision to see space as a viable investment beyond being a commercial orbital supplier, that holds much of the facilities, experience and know how that many others lack.

{{TODO|Including the spying on the USA. Add short analysis on the transfer of technology to the USA after the USSR collapse}} 

In the West this new reality puts the cards in the hands of the private enterprise, that seems to be only now taking form, even if at an accelerated pace.  It is yet to be seen if they will pull anything more complex than the space tourism concept out of the bag. But the fact remains that private enterprise will not be able or willing to advance the space frontier, due to the risks involved and the higher costs of doing research and development in untested fields where unforeseen problems in development are typical.  We can hope that space agencies and corporations will make improvements in already understood processes.  Especially, they should adopt state of the art technology and quickly adapt to change.  That was always a problem to monolithic government enterprises like NASA.  This is reflected extremely well in the history of the [[w:Space Shuttle|Space Shuttle program]]. One lesson taken from the shuttle program may have been the need for in the future to include decision points to go along with programs that depend upon a number of untested techniques. Then progress is less likely chained to sub-optimum techniques because a commitment was made to them when a large program was undertaken as a whole.  

The main problem with space exploration, that the USSR came to realize, especially after the USA won the race to put a human on the moon, was that there was no special benefit in the action itself, and that the further away from Earth the more costly it becomes.  That is why the USSR has centered on and invested in establishing long human presence in near Earth orbit (holding that record). Note that the USSR was the first nation to put a satellite in orbit, a camera on the moon and to return to Earth the first piece of extraterrestrial soil. It did also extremely well in pioneering the exploration of other planets like Mars and Venus. It would be interesting to know what nations have spent more in space exploration so far.  

The solution then seems to point to going out in small incremental steps.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:An efficiency wage, also commonly referred to as a fair wage, is a theory in behavioral economics suggesting that a wage which exceeds the market clearing wage for a given occupation will illicit greater effort and productivity, ensuring that workers avoid shirking. Generally, there are five sub-types of efficiency wage model.&lt;ref name = &quot;Blackwell&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.blackwell.dk/writing/non-fiction/academic/economics/Efficiency%20Wages.pdf|title= Efficiency Wage Theory|author=Blackwell, Andrew |format =PDF|accessdate= 4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the Shirking Model, the Gift-Exchange Model, the Fair Wage-effort Model, the Adverse Selection Model and the Turnover Model.
==Labor as a Commodity==
Labor is a commodity because it is provided to satisfy wants. Like other tangible goods and services, there is a market clearing price for which the labor demand and supply will be in equilibrium. &lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0262.2006.00707.x/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the price for which a worker is just willing to trade his labor for income, meaning that only the minimal amount of effort will be exerted.  In this situation, a worker may shirk responsibilities that are felt to be unwarranted at the market clearing price or wage. &lt;br /&gt;
The theory of efficiency wages suggests that there is a positive relationship between wages which exceed the market clearing wage and the level of effort that a worker reciprocates to their employer.&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0262.2006.00707.x/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In turn, it is postulated that the effort and therefore productivity of a worker will increase along with their wages.

==Basic Mathematical Model==
The basic concept of efficiency wages can be explained mathematically using the formula below.  In order for a wage to increase the efficiency of a worker, it must satisfy the following:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;θ(α-β) &gt; G&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Where:
&lt;br /&gt;
* θ represents the likelihood that a worker will be caught and punished for unsatisfactory labor
* α represents the efficiency wage
* β represents the going market clearing wage
* G represents the value a worker places on providing only the minimum necessary effort
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A worker will choose the benefit, '''G''', of supplying the minimum level of effort his occupation requires in the case that their employer fails to provide a wage '''α''' large enough to render the risk of release, '''θ(α-β)''', greater than or equal to the benefit of slacking on the job.  The efficiency wage '''α''' must exceed the market clearing wage '''β''' so that the cost associated with losing one's job is greater than the benefit of supplying minimum effort.  If the wage '''α''' does not exceed '''β''', a worker can simply move to a different firm within the industry and maintain a constant level of utility while enjoying the benefits of minimal effort.&lt;ref&gt;http://areweb.berkeley.edu/~perloff/PDF/effic.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficiency Wages and Employment==
In an economy which features full employment, the efficiency wage concept will be ineffectual due to the reasons explained above however, the very nature of the efficiency wage guarantees that an economy will not operate at full employment levels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vwl7.wi.tu-darmstadt.de/media/vwl7/downloads_3/ws0910_2/akerlof_shiller_on_eff_wages.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The wages - paid by firms to induce increased effort - exceed those that would clear the labor market, resulting in a decreased level of overall employment.  This is necessary to ensure that the mechanisms at work within the efficiency wage theory function properly.  As the mathematical model indicates: a worker will choose to forgo limited effort if and only if the potential losses incurred by termination exceed the benefit of shirking.  The resulting marketplace conditions do not guarantee that laborers will be able to find work after termination, and will therefore take measures to avoid such a fate.

Furthermore, shirking and unemployment are inversely related. Simply put, lower levels of unemployment will result in greater shirking as the perceived difficulty of obtaining a job in the case termination decreases, while higher levels of unemployment have the reverse effect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vwl7.wi.tu-darmstadt.de/media/vwl7/downloads_3/ws0910_2/akerlof_shiller_on_eff_wages.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Effects==
* Without the self-regulation that stems from the implementation of efficiency wages, ensuring efficient labor from workers would require that firms increase monitoring levels.&lt;ref&gt;http://areweb.berkeley.edu/~perloff/PDF/effic.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  However, increased monitoring paired with low wages will result in a labor force that feels more disconnected from their sense of duty to the firm, compounding the problem of inefficient labor.  Increasing wages can help ignite a workers sense of duty, leading them to feel more closely associated with the goals of the firm.  As a result, they will put forth more effort in their occupations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vwl7.wi.tu-darmstadt.de/media/vwl7/downloads_3/ws0910_2/akerlof_shiller_on_eff_wages.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* In spite of this, empirical evidence suggests that the benefits of increased wages are short lived. In an experiment organized by Uri Gneezy and John List, two mutually exclusive groups of individuals, say A and B, were asked to digitize a library's catalog. Both A and B were promised a wage of $12 an hour for six hours of labor.  Upon arrival, however, group A was instead offered a wage of $20 an hour, 167% of group B's wage.  Initially, the generosity of the wage was reciprocated by the individual laborers of group A- information processed by A exceeded that of B by nearly 25%, suggesting greater effort.  After ninety minutes time, productivity slipped to levels which were indistinguishable from that of group B.&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0262.2006.00707.x/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* In is uncertain if these results would be reflected in extended time periods, where factors other than wage may effect one's effort and productivity.&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0262.2006.00707.x/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
==Ford's $5 Work Day==
It is impossible to have a proper discussion of efficiency wages without bringing up Henry Ford's $5 work day. January 5th, 1914 became one of the most important events in the history labor economics. Harley Shaiken of the Economic Policy Institute wrote that as a result of his wages, Ford saw rising productivity which allowed for higher profitability, a surprise to his competitor firms. &lt;ref&gt; Harley Shaiken, “Unions, the Economy, and Employee Free Choice” Economic Policy Institute. February 22, 2007. &lt;/ref&gt; Though, some economists have questioned whether Ford was paying his workers efficiency wages in the first place. Daniel M. G. Raff and Lawrence H. Summers, two prominent economists, concluded, in a very influential paper that is commonly cited in reference to efficiency wages, that Ford did in fact use efficiency wages. It is very hard to gain direct quantitative analysis on productivity of workers who would qualify as having efficiency wages. Different firms give wages of different quantities skewing the analysis. &lt;ref&gt; Raff, D., and Summers, L. (1987), “Did Henry Ford pay efficiency wages?”, Journal of Labor Economics, Oct 1987 pg. S59 &lt;/ref&gt; For all of these technical issues in setting up a quantitative methodology, they settled for a historical approach. A historical approach was made easy by the Ford example because each worker received an increase in wages from $2.34 to $5.&lt;ref&gt;Raff, D., and Summers, L. (1987), “Did Henry Ford pay efficiency wages?”, Journal of Labor Economics, Oct 1987 pg. S69&lt;/ref&gt; This isolated and uniform incident allowed for appropriate analysis. &lt;ref&gt; Raff, D., and Summers, L. (1987), “Did Henry Ford pay efficiency wages?”, Journal of Labor Economics, Oct 1987 pg. S59 &lt;/ref&gt; First, they found that Ford intended to pay wages to increase his profitability. Next, they analyzed the effects of the policy on the quality of workers, turnover, and other desired effects that should occur as a result of efficiency wages.&lt;ref&gt;Raff, D., and Summers, L. (1987), “Did Henry Ford pay efficiency wages?”, Journal of Labor Economics, Oct 1987 pg. S59-60&lt;/ref&gt; The first effect of the wage increase was to see an enlargement of the supply of labor; so much so, that the factory had to repel them with water, the excess supply.&lt;ref&gt;Raff, D., and Summers, L. (1987), “Did Henry Ford pay efficiency wages?”, Journal of Labor Economics, Oct 1987 pg. S73&lt;/ref&gt; The intent was not to gain higher quality workers necessarily but to reduce worker turnover and compensate for the crude working conditions. Turnover, by some estimates, dropped from 400% to 23%.&lt;ref&gt;Raff, D., and Summers, L. (1987), “Did Henry Ford pay efficiency wages?”, Journal of Labor Economics, Oct 1987 pg. S74&lt;/ref&gt; Profits rose as productivity increased by 40 to 70%.&lt;ref&gt;Raff, D., and Summers, L. (1987), “Did Henry Ford pay efficiency wages?”, Journal of Labor Economics, Oct 1987 pg. S77&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to increased output (15% more cars with 14% less workers)&lt;ref&gt;Raff, D., and Summers, L. (1987), “Did Henry Ford pay efficiency wages?”, Journal of Labor Economics, Oct 1987 pg. S76&lt;/ref&gt; and a reduced ability of workers to collude to work less hard&lt;ref&gt;Raff, D., and Summers, L. (1987), “Did Henry Ford pay efficiency wages?”, Journal of Labor Economics, Oct 1987 pg. S81&lt;/ref&gt;. Though, the author's concede that it is not possible to attribute all productivity gains in the Ford plant to efficiency wages. The Ford plant had the capability to monitor their workers for effort, new technology played an incalculable role, and the quality of the work was &quot;menial&quot; in the first place so turnover was not a very high cost to Ford's firm.&lt;ref&gt;Raff, D., and Summers, L. (1987), “Did Henry Ford pay efficiency wages?”, Journal of Labor Economics, Oct 1987 pg. S60&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to Fair Wage-effort Model==
Fair wage-effort hypothesis is a member of the family of the efficiency wage model. It is a sub-model with improvements on the efficiency model.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blackwell&quot;/&gt;

===Introduction to Fair Wage-effort Hypothesis=== 
The concept of the fair wage-effort hypothesis can be described by a narrative. Bill and Hu who are close friends work in different factories, but they are responsible for the same kind of work. One day, they talked about how much they made. The differences in wages shocked Hu. He thought it was unfair to receive less wage for the same amount of work. As a result, he decided to work less hard. This is one of many possible narratives to identify the fair wage-effort hypothesis. Basically, if someone feels he does not receive a wage he think is fair, he will proportionately decrease his level of work effort. This is the main idea of the fair wage-effort hypothesis. It can be translated, mathematically to e = min (w/w*, 1), where e equals effort a worker contributes to his work, w equals actual wage, w* equals fair wage, and 1 is maximum and normal effort corresponding to the market-clear wage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;&gt;{{Citation| last=Akerlof| first=George A.| last2=Yellen | first2=Janet L. | title=The Fair Wage-Effort Hypothesis and Unemployment| journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics| volume=105| issue=2| year=1990| pages=255-283|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2937787}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, how to interpret e = min (w/w*, 1)? A worker will exert the lower number that represents effort in the function.

=== Important Motivations for Akerlof and Yellen to Construct Fair Wage-effort Hypothesis===
Through looking at 4 motivations for the fair wage-effort hypothesis, you will have a profound insight of it.

# ''Equity Theory'': J. Stacy Adams [1963] asserted that the exchange between the perceived value labor input and the perceived value of remuneration should be equal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; There is an economic formula to interpret it: e = w/w*, where w is the perceived value of remuneration, w* is the perceived value of a unit of effective labor, and e is the number of units of effective labor input. Akerlof and Yellen used a realistic study conducted by  Edward E. Lawler and Paul W. O'gara [1967] to support the fair wage-effort hypothesis. In the study, Lawler and O'gara compared the performance of workers who received 25 cents per interview contrasted to, the performance of workers who were intensely underpaid at 10 cents per interview. &lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; They found that the underpaid interviewers conducted poorer quality interviews. &lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt;
# ''Relative Deprivation Theory'': Relative deprivation theory indicates that how people think of fairness are grounded on comparisons with salient others. &lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; 
# ''Social Exchange Theory'': Akerlof and Yellen used Peter M. Blau's model of exchange [1955] and George C. Homans' [1961] social exchange theory to explain the fair wage-effort hypothesis. Blau's model hypothesizes that equivalent rewards will be achieved on both sides of an exchange after the costs are deducted. In Blau's empirical study [1955] motivating him to propose this hypothesis, the agents who were in charge of investigative work could consult with other agents as to difficult problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; He found that the average agents tended to consult more with the agents with the average expertise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; The consultation between the average and the experts were not frequent due to less reciprocation based on Blau's explanation. &lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; Homans [1961] had a similar theory that provided a simple proposition to Akerlof and Yellen's model.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; If workers think they receive unfair wages, they will be angry. The anger probably reduce workers of labor input.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt;
# ''Empirical Observation of Work Restriction in the Workplace'': Sociologist Stanley B. Mathewson [1969] as a participant observer recorded 223 instances of restriction in 105 establishments in 47 different locations from his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; He concluded, &quot;occasionally workers have an idea that they are worth than management is willing to pay them. When they are not receiving the wage they think fair, they adjust their production to the pay received.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; It underlies the fair wage-effort hypothesis. Another sociologist, Donald Roy, observed an interesting phenomenon from his own experience that heavy papers would be suddenly tore and stuck to the machine's rollers during the work due to the machine crew who was not satisfied with his wage putting excessive stress on the machine when he operated it. &lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt;

===Advantages over the Original Efficiency Wage Model===
In terms of labor market, the fair wage-effort model provides better explanations for some phenomena, such as the existence of involuntary unemployment. Akerlof and Yellen thought the leading efficiency wage model built on maximizing behavior failed to predict wage compression, negative correlation between unemployment and skill, and the strong positive correlation between industry profits and industry wages; in contrast, the efficiency wage model with respect to fairness better explained these difficulties. &lt;ref name = &quot;Yellen&quot;&gt;{{Citation| last=Akerlof| first=George A.| last2=Yellen | first2=Janet L. | title=Fairness and Unemployment| journal=The American Economic Review| volume=78| issue=2| year=1988| pages=44-49|url=http://www.jstor.org.ezproxy2.library.arizona.edu/stable/1818095}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the efficiency wage model with the feature of hedonism that workers hedonistically maximized utility merely subject to their pay and their effort seemed simplistic and it lacked workers' motivation.&lt;ref name =&quot;Yellen&quot;/&gt;

===Models Based on the the Fair Wage-effort Hypothesis===

====A Rudimentary Model of Unemployment with the Fair Wage-effort Hypothesis====
This model built on the fair wage-effort hypothesis (e = min (w/w*, 1) is used to explain unemployment. And it is credited to Akerlof and Yellen. It is assumed that the fair wage, w*, is exogenously determined, there is a single class of labor, and it is perfectly competitive market.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt;  
In addition to the function e = min (w/w*, 1), there is a production function: Q = αeL,
Where: 
* Q = out put
* α = the marginal product of a unit of effective labor
* e = average effort of laborers hired 
* L = the labor hired.
Also, there is a trick concerning with w*. The variable,w*, is  not only fair wage, but it also can be a benchmark to the marginal cost of a unit of effective labor. The marginal cost of a unit of effective labor is at least as large as w* under the fair wage-effort hypothesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt;  It's because an additional worker hired is paid, psychologically, a fair wage when a firm considers effort in relation to production. The wage per unit of effort,w/e, is the real marginal cost of effective labor. Finally, Akerlof and Yellen assume there is a fixed supply of labor, which is independent of the wage rate. &lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; 

=====Analysis=====
In the model, the unemployment rate is either 100% or zero.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; 
# In the case that α exceeds w* (firm will gain benefit from hiring one additional worker): At the beginning, Akerlof and Yellen assume the aggregate supply of labor is greater than the aggregate demand for labor so that there is unemployment and the firm is free to set any wage it wants due to this phenomenon of excessive supply of labor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; As a result, a firm's goal is to choose a wage to minimizes w/e.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; If the firm chooses to pay workers any wage not exceeding w*, the marginal cost of effective labor will be w* instead of w.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; This is because w/e is less than w*/e and the prerequisite is that the marginal cost of a unit of effective labor is at least as large as w*. The following process will be like the marginal product of effective labor &gt; the marginal cost of effective labor (α &gt; w*) -&gt; the firm hires an infinite amount of labor -&gt; aggregate excess demand for labor -&gt; w &gt; w* (the firm increases the wage, under the competition).&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; However, the demand for labor is still infinite when wage is between w* and α.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;/&gt; It's because the marginal product of effective labor is still larger than the marginal cost of effective labor. In a word, if  α &gt; w*, the unemployment is zero and all labor will be hired. 
# In the case that w* exceeds α: the marginal cost of effective labor is greater than the marginal product of effective labor, a firm no longer hires any worker. As a result, the unemployment rate is 100%.

===Different Approaches to the Fair Wage-effort hypothesis===
Thomas I. Palley has a different view of the fair wage-effort hypothesis. There are two differences between his fair wage-effort model and Akerloff and Yellen's model. One is that Palley focuses on wage-profit, which indicates worker-firm concerns, while Akerloff and Yellen emphasize on wage-wage, which reflects comparisons between workers. &lt;ref name=&quot;Palley&quot;&gt;{{Citation| last=Palley| first=Thomas I.| title=The Fair Wage-Effort Hypothesis:Implications for the Distribution of Income and Dual Labor Markets| journal=Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization| volume=24| issue=2| year=1994| pages=195-205|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167268194900264}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other difference is that Palley's model does not have psychological consequences in contrast to A-Y's because someone argues that effort and more involvement in the work increase workers' happiness. &lt;ref name=&quot;Palley&quot;/&gt; Akerloff and Yellen's fair wage-effort hypothesis is based on the how workers value their treatment. If they psychologically think they does not receive fair wage, they will proportionally reduce their effort. However, this may be the case that feeling involvement in work enhances their happiness, workers will not reduce their effort proportionally even when they think they are not paid fairly. It's difficult to decide which is overweight. 

Palley thought treating labor as commodity misrepresent the nature of the labor exchange because people could intentionally react to the exchange, unlike the apathetic commodity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Palley&quot;/&gt; Also, he provided a new way to look at the relationship between fairness and effort. His idea was that effort depends on the relation of fairness-firm's non-labor surplus: e = Min [e(wL/(pq-rk)), e(1)], e'&gt;0, e&quot;&lt;0, e(0)= 0, e= e(1) if pq -rk -wL&lt;0, Where:
* e = level of effort
* w = nominal wage
* L = level of labor input
* p = price of output
* r = cost of capital
* k = level of capital stock
The equation e = Min [e(wL/(pq-rk)), e(1)] specifies effort as a function of the level of non-labor surplus and makes a connection between the value they receive and the value they contribute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Palley&quot;/&gt; Pq = the value of output, rk = the non-labor cost, wL = labor cost, and pq - rk = the value the labor create. If wL - (pq -rk) = 0, effort is e(1); if wL - (pq -rk) &lt; 0, effort declines; if wL -(pq - rk) &gt; 0, effort is e (1).&lt;ref name=&quot;Palley&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Background Information: What is Parkinson's Disease?==

Parkinson’s Disease is a degenerative disorder which affects the brain&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuman&quot;&gt;Kuman, V., Abbas, A.K., Fausto, N. &amp; Aster, J.C., 2010, Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 8th Eddition, Elsevier, United States.&lt;/ref&gt;. It occurs due to the death of cells which produce a type of hormone known as dopamine: the cause of this cell death remains unknown &lt;ref name=&quot;Kuman&quot;/&gt;. Dopamine is associated with transmission of signals for voluntary movement, motivation, sleep, mood and attention. In some cases Parkinson’s disease is accompanied by dementia &lt;ref name=&quot;Kuman&quot;/&gt;. 

&lt;big&gt;'''Symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease include:'''&lt;/big&gt;
* Diminished facial expression
* Stooped posture
* Slowness of voluntary movement 
* Accelerated steps and shortening step length
* Tremor (known as a pill rolling tremor)
* Some mental impairment
* Poor balance

There are forms of Parkinson’s Disease which are genetic; however this only makes up a limited number of cases. In the majority of Parkinson’s patients the cause is unknown with no genetic component &lt;ref name=&quot;Kuman&quot;/&gt;. 
Exercise is known to greatly benefit individuals with Parkinson’s Disease &lt;ref name=&quot;Allen&quot;&gt;Allen, N.E., Sherrington, C., Paul, S.S. &amp; Canning, C.G., 2011, “Balance and Falls in Parkinson’s &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin&quot;&gt;Goodwin, V.A., Richards, S.H, Taylor, R.S., Taylor A.H. &amp; Campbell, J.L., 2008, “The Effectiveness of Exercise Interventions for People with Parkinson’s Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis”, Movement Disorders, vol. 23, no.5, pp. 631 – 640.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris&quot;&gt;Morris, M.E., Iansek, R., Matyas, T.A. &amp; Summers, J.J., 1994, “Ability to modulate walking cadence remains intact in Parkinson's disease”, Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, vol. 57, pp.  1532 – 1534.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Speelman&quot;&gt;Speelman, A.D., van de Warrenburg, B.P., van Nimwegen, M., Petzinger, G.M., Munneke, M. &amp; Bloem, R.B., 2011, “How might physical activity benefit patients with Parkinson disease?”, Nature – Advanced Online Publication, pp. 1- 7.&lt;/ref&gt;.  One of the most important benefits of exercise for Parkinson’s Disease patients is increased mobility and this is seen through an increase in patients step length, increase leg strength and improved posture, significantly improving several symptoms of the disease &lt;ref name=&quot;Speelman&quot;/&gt;.  Mobility is a major issue for people suffering from Parkinson’s Disease and as the research shows it is important for people to undertake regular exercise maintain or improve mobility &lt;ref name=&quot;Allen&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Speelman&quot;/&gt;.   As Parkinson’s Disease affects the area of the brain which is associated motivation it can be difficult for individuals suffering from the disease to motivate themselves to exercise however the benefits of exercise are clear.

==Recommendations for Exercise==

Patients that are suffering from Parkinson's Disease can follow standard exercise guidelines when exercising and should try to include the following types of training;&lt;ref&gt;Fitness and Flexibility: The Role of Exercise in PD Managment.  National Parkinson Foundation.  Retrieved from www.parkinson.org &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Cianci, H. Parkinson's Disease: Fitness Counts.  National Parkinson Foundation.  Retrieved from www.parkinson.org &lt;/ref&gt;

* Aerobic exercise, such as treadmill training, swimming or cycling, for a minimum of 20 minutes at least 3 days per week
* Strengthening/weight-bearing or resistance training exercises to help maintain muscle strength should be performed 2- 3 times per week 
* Balance and flexibility exercises such as stretching to assist in mobility can be performed daily


The hardest part with starting to exercise is being consistent and not losing motivation so try the following out to see what works best for you;

* Start simple and gradually build up, if your not sure where to start contact your Dr/Physical Therapist for guidance
* Make it fun, ensure that the exercise you are completing is something you enjoy e.g dancing, aerobics, walking
* Set yourself goals that you want to achieve e.g. climbing the stairs with out any help
* Work within your own limitations, find a level of exercise that is challenging but not 'too hard'
* Mix things up, try doing a little bit each day and add a touch of variety
* Exercise with a friend or participate in community exercise classes


At any stage if you are unsure what is safe/appropriate for you to be participating in please ensure that you seek professional advice.

      <text xml:space="preserve"># Know where all the emergency equipments are located.
# To use the shower/eyewash, simply pull down the chain. For a special station designed only for eyewash, there is usually a foot petal you stand on to activate it. An uninjured neighbor should assist the person to the shower/eyewash.
# To use the fire blanket, completely cover the flames with the blanket until fire goes out. Obviously, the fire should be small enough to be covered by the blanket. Otherwise, use the fire extinguisher. Use the fire blanket to cover someone who just used the shower since their cloth would be wet and partially burned.
# Before using the fire extinguisher, you should know what class of fire extinguisher it is. There are three main classes with '''class A''' being suitable for regular combustible fires such as plastics or rubber, '''class B''' being suitable for oil based fires such as gasoline and 
'''class C''' being suitable for electrical fires. '''DO NOT USE CLASS A EXTINGUISHER FOR ELECTRICAL FIRES.'''Class A extinguisher is made up of high pressure water so there is a risk of electrical shock. Pull off the metal safety pin and aim at the base of the fire, not at the flame itself. You should be trying to put out the source of the fire, which is much more effective.

[[File:Aerobicexercise.jpg‎|right|100px|frame|Aerobic exercise]]
====What is aerobic exercise?====
Aerobic exercise is physical activity of low to moderate intensity that is dependent on the presence of oxygen. Fuel sources for this energy system is primarily carbohydrates and fat&lt;ref&gt;McArdle, W.D., Katch, F.I. &amp; Katch, V.L. 2006, Essentials of exercise physiology, 1st edn, Lippincott William &amp; Wilkins.&lt;/ref&gt;.

====What is Metabolic Syndrome?====
Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of medical disorders that increase an individuals risk of CVD and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). These medical disorders include&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idf.org/webdata/docs/IDF_Meta_def_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;: 
*Excessive central obesity
*Insulin Resistance or Glucose Intolerance 
*High blood pressure (systolic  &gt;130mm Hg and diastolic &gt;85mg Hg)
*High blood sugar levels
*High levels of triglycerides (&gt;150mg/dL)
*Low HDL levels (&lt;40mg/dL)
When a patient has multiple risk factors present the risk of CVD and T2DM increases significantly. While all of the above are risk factors central obesity and insulin resistance are recognised as the most important factors. Other risk factors include: age, genetics and hormone changes.

=='''Effect of aerobic exercise on Insulin Resistance and Central Obesity'''==
====What is central obesity and how does aerobic exercise effect it?====
Central Obesity also known as abdominal obesity is the accumulation of abdominal fat resulting in an increase of waist size, an excess of this visceral fat leads to the abdomen to protrude excessively. The immediate cause of obesity is net energy imbalance: that the person comsumes more energy than is expended&lt;ref&gt;McArdle, W.D., Katch, F.I. &amp; Katch, V.L. 2006, Essentials of exercise physiology, 1st edn, Lippincott William &amp; Wilkins.&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore, as a person increases energy expenditure via aerobic exercise, an energy balance or energy deficit is creating leading to a reduction in obesity. A person with a BMI of 30 or more is generally considered obese&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/topics/obesity/en/&lt;/ref&gt;.


Although Metabolic Sydnrome is a combination of medical disorders, central obesity and insulin resistance is a key contributing factors, reflecting the fact the syndromes prevalence is driven by the strong relationship between waist circumference and increasing adiposity &lt;ref&gt;Fauci, Anthony S. (2008). Harrison's principles of internal medicine.McGraw-Hill Medical. ISBN0-07-147692-X&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Insulinresistance.jpg‎‎|right|100px|frame|Effects of Insulin Resistance]]

====What is insulin resistance and how is it affected by aerobic exercise?====
Insulin resistance is a physiological condition characterised normal amount of insulin producing a subnormal effect in muscle, adipose, and liver cells, resulting in elevated fasting glucose levels&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, E. &amp; Rolfes, S.R. 2010, &quot;Energy Balance and Body Composition&quot; in Understanding Nutrition, eds. P. Williams &amp; N. Rose, 12th edn, Wadsworth Cengage Learning, California, pp. 240-269&lt;/ref&gt;. Primary intervention strategies for insulin resistant and thus metabolic syndrome include weight reduction and increased physical activity. Insulin is produced by pancreatic β-cells and is required to prevent hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) after meals. Insulin binds to an insulin receptor in muscle and fat cells allowing the uptake of glucose from the blood therefore, lowering blood sugar levels. However, as insulin resistance increases or the insulin receptor malfunctions, the ability of this mechanism to function is reduced preventing uptake of glucose and increasing blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia)&lt;ref&gt;Shulman GI. Cellular mechanisms of insulin resistance. J Clin Invest. 2000;106:171–176.&lt;/ref&gt;. Aerobic exercise increases the insulin receptors sensitivity and also improves the pancreatic β-cells ability to produce insulin thus, reducing insulin resistance.

====How does aerobic exercise affect metabolic syndrome?====
There is a significant relationship between aerobic exercise, central obesity and insulin resistance. The benefits of performing aerobic exercise are beneficial as they directly reduce the risk factors of metabolic syndrome. These include&lt;ref&gt;Exercise and Physical Fitness. Doyle, A,J. (1997) Department of Kinesiology and Health at Georgia State University. http://www2.gsu.edu/~wwwfit/benefits.html&lt;/ref&gt;:
*Reduce body fat and central obesity
*Increases insulin sensitivity
*Reduce blood pressure
*Reduce resting heart rate
*Reduce blood triglyceride levels
*Helps to increase HDL cholesterol (health cholesterol)
*Build and maintain healthy joints, muscles and bones

By reducing the effects of central obesity and insulin resistance via aerobic exercise the effects of metabolic syndrome can be significantly lowered. This also reduces the relative risk of developing CVD and type 2 diabete mellitus, two of the leading causes of mortality in Australia in 2009&lt;ref&gt;http://abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Products/B6940E9BF2695EE1CA25788400127B0A?opendocument&lt;/ref&gt;.

=='''Recommendations for aerobic exercise'''==
Before starting any exercise program consult with your physician. The reason for this is because exercise increases blood pressure and if hypertension is already present then this can lead to aneurysms and potential ruptures. Before starting any exercise remember to warm up. 5-10 minutes of light aerobic activities before your exercise sessions is adequate&lt;ref&gt;http://exerciseismedicine.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Metabolic-syndrome_full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Also during exercise remember to hydrate. Water is generally the best fluid for rehydrating. Recommendations for aerobic exercise are as follows:

*Incorporate at least 150 minutes of moderately vigorous physical activity into your weekly routine. Walking is generally the                   easiest place to start&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/More/MetabolicSyndrome/Prevention-and-Treatment-of-Metabolic-Syndrome_UCM_301927_Article.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Another efficiency wage reference ==

I haven't looked beyond the abstract yet, but... [http://oep.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/2/336.full.pdf This] looks at efficiency wages and backward-bending labor supply. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TDang|contribs]])

Another good source for efficiency wages is the sorta-popular book ''Animal Spirits'' by Akerlof and Schiller. It discusses two stories behind the efficiency wage. There's particularly good stuff starting on page 104, which can be seen [http://www.vwl7.wi.tu-darmstadt.de/media/vwl7/downloads_3/ws0910_2/akerlof_shiller_on_eff_wages.pdf here]. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TDang|contribs]]) 21:48, 21 October 2011 (UTC)

==Some thoughts for further editing efficiency wage and fair wage==
# I haven't found why fair wage model is better to explain wage compression, negative correlation between unemployment and skill, and the strong positive correlation between industry profits and industry wage. What I read was simple written explanations rather than explicit and detailed ones with graphs. 
# I found that there are five sub-models in the family of efficiency wage model (Shirking Models, Gift-Exchange Model, Fair Wage-effort Model, Adverse Selection Model, and Turnover Model). It's a good direction to explore. 
# Applications of fair wage model is a potential way to discover the core of fair wage-effort model. I haven't found many good applications. Associating reality with the fair wage model is a good way to provide viewers an interesting picture. Pay attention to math part because it is difficult to understand with only number, function, and simple explanation. As a result, I think it is better to reinterpret them into more readable version.  
# continue to trim and polish my edit 
# Lastly, it is good to relate the fair wage fair current cases. Most I found is from 80s and 90s. 

Note: These thoughts are from Banglong Zhu

== math on page ==
In reference to this link above on efficiency wages, I was curious as to whether having mathematical equations was important for this Wikibook. According to my understanding, the book was supposed to be almost exclusively qualitative not quantitative. I was wondering if I could change this page by explaining the equations instead of listing them. If any of you guys had any thoughts on this let me know.

:I think that math at the level of intermediate economics is appropriate for this book, and may be needed for some topics to be really clear. I'd suggest that you leave the math for the moment, and explain them '''in addition'''. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TDang|contribs]]) 21:10, 31 January 2012 (UTC)

== Ford's $5 Wage ==
I think that when talking about efficeincy wages it is only appropriate to bring up Ford's famous five dollar wage. His wage is historically considered one of the first and paramount examples of efficiency wages. So I was wondering if you knew of any good literature on the subject that would be appropriate to cite in this section. Also I was wondering if it was worthwhile to add to the &quot;relative deprivation theory&quot; or if the one sentence describing it was adequate. Also, the equations as they stand, though explained better than I had originally thought, are not visually appealing nor are they easy to grasp. is there a way to change it to how some equations appear on wikipedia?

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Business to Consumer ===

This business model is where businesses sell merchandise, goods, or services to individuals.  These businesses are any of the main types of businesses such as a sole proprietorship, or corporations.  The Business to Consumer model was the first type of e-commerce to be used effectively.  Almost all .com web sites operate with the ''business to consumer'' model.

B2C was one of the first major types of e-commerce business found on the web. Business to Consumer is the most widely recognized form of e-business, B2B is the exchange of information products or services. This takes place between a business and a consumer over the internet. Examples of B2C sites are amazon.com also Walmart.com, BestBuy.com and Ee.com are examples of sites housing a physical location as well (Understanding Computers 13th Edition). 

[[File:Remodeled_Walmart.jpg|thumb|Remodeld walmart]]

{{BookCat}}

B2C model has a business sell products to customers without customer ever stepping into a store.  As such there is some risk with selling items online to customers.  Unlike B2B  models were there is an established working relation with a trusted business partner, there is far more risk involved in selling to unknown stranger.  B2C E-Commerce type web retailers rely on collecting a great deal of information from their potential client prior to purchasing from their store.   Even with the increased effort that is required to protect the purchaser and seller it is still far less time consuming to complete a transaction comparatively to B2B models(J. Carlton Collins, CPA. (n.d.). The Many Flavors of E-Commerce. Accounting Software Advisor . 11-1-2012 retieved. http://www.accountingsoftwareadvisor.com/ec/ectypes.htm).

[[File:Richard Sears.jpg|thumb|Richard Warren Sears was a railroad station agent in North Redwood, Minnesota, when he received an impressive shipment of watches from a Chicago jeweler which were unwanted by a local cube jeweler. Sears purchased them, then sold the watches for a considerable profit to other station agents, then ordered more for resale. Soon he started a business selling watches through mail order catalogs.]]</text>

=== What is Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus? ===
Normal metabolic function of the body requires insulin to regulate glucose levels through uptake in skeletal muscle and suppression of production in the liver &lt;ref name=”kim”&gt; Kim, J., Wei, Y. &amp; Sowers, J. (2008). Role of Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Insulin Resistance. Circulation Research, 102,401-414.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Homeostasis is disturbed in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) often as a result of sedentary lifestyle, old age and possible genetic predispotition &lt;ref name=”ritov”&gt;Ritov, V. et al. (2009). Deficiency of electron transport chain in human skeletal muscle mitochondria in type 2 diabetes. Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab, 298, 49-58.&lt;/ref&gt;. The disease can be characterised by insulin insensitivity and high blood glucose, with the potential to progress to insulin dependency. The 2007-08 National Health Survey found that over 3.8% of the Australian population suffers from T2DM, although actual figures may differ due to the nature of self-reported data &lt;ref name=&quot;AIHW&quot;&gt;Diabetes. (2011). Retrieved October 22, 2011, from AIHW http://www.aihw.gov.au/diabetes/&lt;/ref&gt;. With the incidence of T2DM on the rise, current research has uncovered evidence to suggest that resistance exercise may be helpful in combating the disease.

== Why should Type 2 Diabetics participate in resistance exercise? ==

Exercise, diet and medication play an important role in the management of type 2 diabetes &lt;ref name=&quot;dunstan&quot;&gt; Dunstan, D., Daly, R., Owen, N., Jolley, D., De Courten, M., Shaw, J., &amp; Zimmet, P. (2002). High-Intensity Resistance Training Improves Glycemic Control in older Patients With Type 2 Diabetes. Diabetes Care, 25(10), 1729-1736.&lt;/ref&gt;. Traditionally, aerobic exercise has been prescribed to patients with type 2 diabetes as it has been associated with weight loss, improved glucose tolerance and cardiovascular fitness &lt;ref name=&quot;dunstan&quot; /&gt;. Recent research has found that resistance exercise is also effective at improving diabetes management and is comparable to aerobic exercise &lt;ref name =&quot;eves&quot;&gt; Eves, N., &amp; Plotnikoff, R. (2006). Resistance Training and Type 2 Diabetes. Diabetes Care, 29(8), 1933-1940.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Findings include;

* Decrease in insulin levels &lt;ref name=&quot;castaneda&quot; /&gt;
Small, but significant reduction in HbA1c levels have been found in diabetics after completing resistance exercise regimes. A 1% decrease in HbA1c is associated with a 37% decrease in micro vascular disease and a 21% decrease in risk of diabetes-related death, showing that resistance exercise is important in the management of type 2 diabetes &lt;ref name=&quot;Irvine&quot; /&gt;.

=== Is it safe? ===
Much has been written about the safety of resistance exercise for type 2 diabetics because of various co-morbidities that exist such as hypertension and cardiovascular disease &lt;ref name=&quot;Irvine&quot; /&gt;. However, research has found that high-intensity resistance exercise elicits the same blood pressure response as daily activities such as climbing stairs or carrying groceries &lt;ref name=&quot;sigal&quot;&gt; Sigal, R., Kenny, G., Wasserman, D., Castaneda-Sceppa, C., &amp; White, R. (2006). Physical Activity/Exercise and Type 2 Diabetes. Diabetes Care, 29(6), 1433-1438. &lt;/ref&gt;. In fact, most research has found that the only adverse effect of resistance training is muscle soreness and that it is safe form of exercise even for patients with a high risk of cardiac events &lt;ref name=&quot;Irvine&quot; /&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;castaneda&quot; /&gt;. Patients with severe diabetic retinopathy should not do resistance exercise because of the increased risk of retinal detachment &lt;ref name=&quot;sigal&quot; /&gt;. As with any exercise program, medical advice and clearance should be sought before commencement and there should be adequate supervision.

=== Are there any other benefits? ===
Resistance exercise significantly increases muscle mass and fat-free mass compared to aerobic exercise &lt;ref name=&quot;Irvine&quot; /&gt;. This leads to;

* ''Decreased'' abdominal obesity &lt;ref name=&quot;dunstan&quot; /&gt;
* ''Decreased'' systolic blood pressure &lt;ref name=&quot;castaneda&quot; /&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;sigal&quot; /&gt;
* ''Increased'' renal function &lt;ref name=&quot;sigal&quot; /&gt;
* ''Increased'' muscle strength &lt;ref name=&quot;Irvine&quot; /&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;ibanez&quot; /&gt;
* ''Decreased'' triglycerides &lt;ref name=&quot;castaneda&quot; /&gt;

Resistance exercise also leads to an increase in daily physical activity &lt;ref name=&quot;castaneda&quot; /&gt;. Patients with arthritis or lung disease may also find that resistance exercise is easier to do than aerobic exercise &lt;ref name=&quot;Irvine&quot; /&gt;. Increased muscle strength also helps to reduce the risk of falls in the elderly &lt;ref name=&quot;dunstan&quot; /&gt;.

== Recommendations ==

All training should be under initial supervision by a qualified exercise specialist to ensure minimal risk of injury and maximal health benefits. Additionally, some insulin-dependant patients may find it necessary to alter insulin dose prior to exercise, and should be discussed with a doctor before undertaking any new exercise programs &lt;ref name=&quot;diabetes aus&quot;&gt;Type 2 Diabetes. (2011, September 7). Retrieved October 22, 2011, from Diabetes Australia http://www.diabetesaustralia.com.au/en/Understanding-Diabetes/What-is-Diabetes/Type-2-Diabetes/&lt;/ref&gt;. Recommendations from the American Diabetes Association for a resistance training program are listed below &lt;ref name=&quot;sigal&quot; /&gt;. A progressive resistance training (PRT) model should be followed to achieve this target program, whereby frequency, intensity and time are increased over a specified period &lt;ref name=&quot;ibanez&quot; /&gt;.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| '''Frequency''' || 2-3 times per week
|-
| '''Intensity''' || 3 sets of 8-10 reps at 50-80% 1RM (30-60secs rest between sets)
|-
| '''Time''' || 30-45min sessions
|-
| '''Type''' || Target all major muscle groups. Can include weights, resistance bands, bodyweight
|}


It is important to remember that resistance exercise should be part of a treatment plan that also incorporates; &lt;ref name=&quot;diabetes aus&quot; /&gt; 
* Not smoking
* Regular physical activity
* Maintaining a healthy weight
* Making healthy food choices
* Managing blood pressure and cholesterol levels

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|The Effects of Exercise on Osteoporosis Sufferers}}

Osteoporosis is the most common type of bone disease; it is a weakening of the bones over time due to the loss of minerals, primarily calcium and phosphorous, resulting in a thinning of the bones and a gradual decrease in bone density. Bone production is dependent upon the body obtaining an adequate and ongoing supply of calcium and phosphate in the diet. Failure to obtain adequate supplies of these minerals will result in poor bone growth in youth and re-absorption of the minerals by the body from existing bone, weakening the bone tissue, usually later in life. This decrease in the density of the bones makes them brittle and prone to fracture.

==Causes==
The major cause of osteoporosis in older people are the reduction in estrogen levels in women during menopause and a drop in testosterone levels in men often associated with aging.
Other causes of osteoporosis include:

*Medical conditions such as hyperparathyroidism and chronic kidney disease
*Extensive periods of inactivity such as being confined to a bed
*Insufficient calcium in the diet often associated with eating disorders
*Smoking, alcohol and drug (corticosteroids) abuse
*Vitamin D deficiency

==Effects==
The early stages of osteoporosis do not produce any appreciable signs or symptoms and often the disease may remain undetected until an osteoporotic fracture occurs.
As the condition progresses some or all of the following symptoms may become apparent:

*Fractures associated with little or even no appreciable trauma 
*Neck and lower back pains due to fractures of the vertebra
*Loss of height
*Changes in posture such as developing a kyphotic stoop or dowagers hump on the back

==Treatments==
Treatments for osteoporosis include Lifestyle changes, such as taking part in structured resistance training programs, which, when combined with a diet with a higher intake of calcium and phosphorous, will serve to force the body to lay down new bone with a much more rigid structure than the fragile osteoporotic bone. Other treatments include Medications such as HRT therapy, Biophosphates, Calcitonin and Raloxifene

==Prevention==
Prevention of the onset of osteoporosis is the preferred approach. The risk of incurring the condition can be reduced by:
*Following a healthy balanced diet including Vitamin D and calcium rich foods
*Avoidance of smoking and excess consumption of alcohol
*Regular exercise, consisting of weight bearing/resistance training and cardio routines.

==Test Pages==
I have deleted some test pages you created under the Wikibooks root.  My first thought was to move them into your userspace (i.e., into [[User:MorganWilliams/Background]], etc) but since they only contained &quot;blah blah&quot;, I figured it would be OK to just delete them.  I propose moving [[Wikibook Projects]] to [[User:MorganWilliams/Wikibook Projects]] as well, since the scope of that page does not appear to be global to Wikibooks.  Let me know if you can suggest a better place to move it to. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 01:36, 22 October 2011 (UTC)
:After visiting your user page and seeing that you've linked to those new pages from there, I have gone ahead and moved them.  Let me know if you have objections or would like the pages moved elsewhere.  They don't belong in the root of the Wikibooks hierarchy. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 01:40, 22 October 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Notation ==

=== Points and Lines ===

The uppercase Roman letters (A, B, C ...) will be used to denote points. In addition to denoting points in space, they can also denote the vertexes of a polygon and the vertexes' respective angles. For two arbitrary points A and B:

* [{{overline|AB}}] or {{overline|AB}} denotes a line segment beginning at A and ending at B. Line segments are geometric objects defined to be the shortest path between two points. In other words, if you had two points on a piece of paper, and you wanted to trace the shortest possible path between those two points, the result will always be a line segment. Here, the left square bracket and the right square bracket mean that the line segment begins at A and ends at B.

* [{{overline|AB}}) denotes a ray that begins at A and passes through B. Rays are like a line segment, except that rays don't just stop when they reach B like line segments do; instead, they keep on going to infinity in one direction. Because of this, we use a left square bracket to enclose the A and a right parenthesis to enclose the B.

* ({{overline|AB}}) denotes a line beginning at A and ending at B. Lines are like rays, except that rays go to infinity in both directions. Because of this, both A and B are surrounded by parenthesis instead of square brackets.

Most other geometry textbooks try to use &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{AB}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overleftrightarrow{AB}&lt;/math&gt; for rays and lines. This text chooses a different notation because it's more typographically convenient and easier to represent in HTML.

=== Polygons and Shapes ===

Polygons are general shapes where three or more line segments are connected together to form a closed loop. These line segments are called sides. When these sides are connected, they form vertexes. This book will denote a polygon by its vertexes, and it will denote them by a square character (□) following with the name of the vertexes. So if a polygon has five vertexes named alphabetically, it shall be titled □ABCDE. Sides of a polygon shall be denoted by lowercase roman letters (a, b, c...).

A special case of polygons are known as the triangles, which are polygons with three sides. The sum of the sides' lengths is commonly called the perimeter. In this text, the perimeter will be denoted by 2p; the constant &quot;2&quot; appears so that we can denote the semiperimeter (that is, the perimeter divided by two) by simply p. Triangles shall be denoted by △ABC, where A, B, and C refer to the vertexes of the triangle.

h&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, h&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, and h&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; denote the altitudes and m&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, m&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, and m&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; the medians of △ABC, with the [[w:subscripts]] referring to sides a, b, and c respectively. Altitudes are line segments perpendicular to a respective side which connect to the opposite vertex. Medians are line segments that connect its respective midpoint to the opposite vertex of a triangle.

t&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is the internal bisector of ∠A. T&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is the external bisector of ∠A. The difference between internal and external bisectors can be found in the figure to the right.

=== Circles ===

Circles are geometric objects with a very specific definition: they are the set of points (often called a ''locus'') that have the same distance from a given point, with the name of the point being the center of the circle. Circles with a specific center and radius will be denoted by ⨀{{overline|OR}}, where {{overline|OR}} is the radius and the terminal point O is the center. If the value of the radius is dependent on a line defined elsewhere, then a circle can be denoted by ⨀(O, {{overline|AB}}), where O is still the center and {{overline|AB}} is the line being used for the radius.</text>

[[File:Osteoporosis.JPG|thumb|An osteoporotic elderly women (Japan)]] &lt;small&gt;This fact sheet has been designed for people suffering from osteoporosis and who hope to improve their condition using weight training. It provides background information on osteoporosis and the role of weight training in treating the condition, along with current research studies which prove the beneficial effects of weight training and osteoporosis. Furthermore, exercise recommendations have been provided for anyone who is interested in designing a weight training program to deal with the condition.&lt;/small&gt;


==What is Osteoporosis?==
Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterised by gradual thinning of bone tissue and loss of bone density. This condition occurs when ‘bone resorption out paces bone deposit’ &lt;ref&gt;Marieb, Elaine N. Hoehn, Katja. (2007). Human anatomy &amp; Physiology, 7th edition, Pearson Education, inc, pg 193.&lt;/ref&gt;, increasing both fragility of bones and chances of fracture.

==Role of weight training in treating osteoporosis?==
Long-term weight training is one of the best treatments for osteoporosis because of its effect on bone mineral density. Placing mechanical stress on 'bone during weight-bearing exercises are thought to directly affect the structure characteristics of bone’&lt;ref&gt;Gormley, J. Hussey, J. (2005). Exercise therapy: prevention and treatment of disease, pg 173.&lt;/ref&gt;. This structure and characteristic change in areas undergoing long-term mechanical stress is as a result of the activation of osteogenesis, which involves: ‘the balance between local formation and resorption changing to favour formation, thereby increasing local density and making that region stiffer’ &lt;ref&gt; Meunier P. J. (1998). Osteoporosis: diagnosis and management, Martin Dunitz Ltd. pg 273.&lt;/ref&gt;. Exercise, however, cannot completely reverse the effects of osteoporosis, but it can slow the process down or stop the disease from further systematically thinning bone and increasing its fragility.

==Exercise recommendations==
[[File:Elderly exercise.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Elderly man with a dumbell sitting on an exercise ball]] Osteoporosis is a systematic condition, so full-body exercise is important. Individuals with osteoporosis are at a much higher risk of having a fracture than those without the disease; therefore exercise load must start a moderate level, and then gradually increased in order to activate an osteogenic response. Though aerobic exercise is beneficial for individuals with osteoporosis and is ‘advantageous for the total person; it may not provide as much protection of bone' &lt;ref&gt; Meunier P. J. (1998). Osteoporosis: diagnosis and management, Martin Dunitz Ltd. pg 171.&lt;/ref&gt; as anaerobic resistance training does; therefore exercise volume should range between 2-3 sets per exercise, and 4-8 repetitions per set. Full recovery after sessions is also crucial, so strength training should not be on consecutive days and should not exceed 4 days per week. Besides strength, flexibility is also an important factor for reducing the risk of falls. Stretching exercises can be used before and/or after training sessions to increase flexibility. Furthermore, the Chinese martial art known as ‘Thai Chi’ can be used to improve strength, posture and balance; making it an ideal activity for osteoporosis sufferers. All exercises subscribed must have a long-term commitment to be capable of treating osteoporosis.

==Research based support for the issues==
In ‘1996, two men, Welsh and Rutherford’&lt;ref&gt;Adler R.A. (2010). Osteoporosis: Pathophysiology and Clinical Management. Humana Press. pg 222.&lt;/ref&gt;, conducted a study to observe the effects on bone mass density in a group of males involved in activities with ranging intensities. These males were split into different conditions undertaking either ‘high intensity, standing, free-weight program, moderate intensity, or seated resistance training’ &lt;ref&gt;Adler R.A. (2010). Osteoporosis: Pathophysiology and Clinical Management. Humana Press. pg 222.&lt;/ref&gt;. Results showed higher resistance training increased ‘lumbar bone mineral density by 2% in men (mean age =54 years)’&lt;ref&gt;Adler R.A. (2010). Osteoporosis: Pathophysiology and Clinical Management. Humana Press. pg 222.&lt;/ref&gt;, while those participating in lower intensity activities had no bone mineral adaptation. This finding shows that bone needs to be loaded just enough to activate the process of osteogenesis; therefore treating osteoporosis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Information==

[[File:Amide-(primary)-skeletal.png|thumb|General Simple Amide]][[File:Amide-(tertiary)-skeletal.png|thumb|Amide with -R Groups on Nitrogen]]An amide functional group consists of a carbonyl group bonded to a nitrogen. In simple amides, two hydrogen atoms are bonded to the nitrogen (-CONH2) while in more complex amides, the nitrogen is bonded to one or two aliphatic or aromatic groups (-CONR).

==Nomenclature==

Naming amides is very similar to naming carboxylic acids. For IUPAC nomenclature, first name the carboxylic acid, and then drop the -oic acid and add amide. For example, propanoic acid would become propanamide and ethanoic acid would become ethanide. The first part of the name depends on the carbon chain the amide is attached to.

==Properties==

===Basicity===

Differing from similar amines, amides show no measurable basicity due to the delocalised lone pairs on the nitrogen. In normal amines or -NH2 functional groups, the lone pair on the nitrogen can accept hydrogen atoms acting as a base. However, the pi bond formed between the double bonded carbon and oxygen in an amide contains p orbitals that are positioned almost parallel to the lone pair on the nitrogen. This causes the electron pair to be delocalised and shared throughout the carbonyl part of the molecule. Delocalization reduces an amide's basicity because the electron pair is not associated with a single atom reducing the intensity and focus of its proton drawing ability. Delocalization also helps to stabilize the overall structure of the amide and as a result more energy would be required to break the shared electron structure. 

===Melting Point===

Methanamide is a liquid at room temperature while other amides remain solid. Relative to their size, amides have relatively high melting points due to the hydrogen bonding between the partially positive hydrogen atoms the -NH2 group and another electronegative oxygen. Each simple amide has two partially positive hydrogen atoms and two pairs of electrons on the oxygen allowing for multiple possible sites of hydrogen bonding. A lot of energy is required to break these hydrogen bonds increasing the melting point of amides.

===Solubility===

Small amides are soluble in water because they may hydrogen bond with water molecules. Larger amides have trouble dissolving because of their long hydrophobic carbon chains. Amides are typically less soluble than amines and carboxylic acids because they can both donate and accept hydrogen bonds.

==Preparation==

Carboxylic acids can be used to prepare amides by reaction with solid ammonium carbonate in acid to form a ammonium salt. Upon heating, this salt dehydrates to produce and amide and water. Acyl chlorides (acid chlorides) will react violently ammonia to create ammonium chloride and an amide of the acyl chloride. Acid anhydrides will also react with ammonia to produce amides such as the reaction of ethanoic anhydride with ammonia producing ethanamide and ammonium ethanoate.

===Synthesis of Amides===

Amides are derived from a reaction between an amine and a carboxylic acid.  Between these two molecules we have two competing nucleophiles, the oxygen of the alcohol group in the carboxylic acid molecule and the nitrogen of the amine.  A nucleophile is a chemical species that donates a pair of electrons to an electrophile to create a chemical bond in a reaction.  With nitrogen lying to the left of the oxygen on the periodic table, nitrogen serves as a better base and better nucleophile than the alcohol.  The reaction between an amine and a carboxylic acid is based on an addition and elimination reaction.  Although this is a simple and easy reaction, it is not the most effective and efficient way of producing amides.  The reaction between the two also contains a competing acid-base reaction, which produces a salt.  Therefore with competing products, the addition-elimination reaction between the two is not the most effective way to isolate an amide.   A better procedure would be the reaction between an acyl halide, an activated carboxylic acid derivative, and an amine.  The replacement of the hydroxyl group in the carboxylic acid with a halide produces a reactive molecule called an acyl halide.  With halogens being the most electronegative atoms, the presence of it in the molecule pulls the electrons away from the carbon of the carbonyl atom, creating an electrophilic site.  With an electrophilic site present, the nucleophilic nitrogen of the amine will easily react with the acyl halide to form an amide. 

[[File:Acyl Halide plus Amine All.PNG|938 × 212px|center]]

Step 1: The nucleophilc nitrogen attacks the carbon of the carbonyl, pushing the electrons of the double bond of the carbonyl to the oxygen.  Formation of a zwitterion occurs (negative charge on the oxygen, positive on the nitrogen).

Step 2: The favored and more stable carbonyl is reformed, kicking out the halide.

Step 3: The positive charge is quenched as the halide comes back and removes a hydrogen from the nitrogen, forming an amide and a hydrogen halide.

==Reactions==

===Hydrolysis===
Hydrolysis of amides can occur under both acidic and basic conditions. Under acidic conditions, amides catalyzed by dilute acid react with water to form carboxylic acids and ammonium chlorides. An example would be heating ethanamide in dilute hydrochloric acid to form ethanoic acid and ammonium chloride. If heated under basic conditions such as sodium hydroxide solution, ethanamide will form ammonium gas and sodium ethanoate salt.

===Dehydration and Hofmann Degradation===
Amides can be dehydrated by reaction with phosphorous (V) oxide such as heating ethanamide with phosphorous oxide to produce ethanenitrile with the loss of water. The Hofmann Degradation reaction involves reaction of an amide with a mixture of bromine and sodium hydroxide resulting in the loss of the carbonyl group such as degradation of ethanamide into methylamine.  

==Practical use of polyamides==
[[File:Kevlar_chemical_structure.png|thumb|Chemical Structure of Kevlar]]Polyamides are in general polymers held together by amide links. Nylon consists of repeating chains of carbons held together by amide chains while kevlar is made up of chains of benzene instead of carbon. Nylon is formed from the loss of water between a reaction of hexanedioic acid and diaminohexane while kevlar is formed from the reaction of benzene dicarboxylic acid and diaminobenzene. Nylon is used commercially for clothing, carpets, ropes, and tires while the high strength to weigh ratio of kevlar makes it practical for use in bullet proof vests and other lightweight sturdy needs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Entirely basing ones business in the online realm leaves it highly susceptible to competition.  Low overhead costs(such as web hosting and hiring a web designer) associated with a company based online means it's extremely easy for other people to start their own rival business.  An online business mandates a cutting edge competitive advantage to survive.  E-commerce sites are also more vulnerable to malicious attacks(such as DoS attacks) than brick and mortar stores, and any downtime suffered by a site severely limits their revenue.

Businesses also have to compete for the trust of their clients, because in essence by shopping online one is handing out his or her personal info to someone they can't nor will likely ever see. Data can be stolen from companies' databanks resulting in &lt;strong&gt;identity theft&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;fraudulent charges&lt;/strong&gt;. Despite these disadvantages e-commerce sites face, in the end the desired result is achieved; shopping is made more convenient for everybody.

=Additional disadvantages=

[[File:USPS-Mail-Truck.jpg|thumb|USPS-Mail-Truck]]

Although there are many perks to making purchases online, here are things to keep aware of.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipping and handling - prices and waiting&lt;/strong&gt;. There is no doubt that the shipping process can be a disadvantage. Whether you're a e-customer (paying extra for postage), or the seller (shipping the product out), there will always be that online crutch where a brick &amp; mortar store will succeed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product details - before the purchase&lt;/strong&gt;. When a shopper browses the web for a product, it becomes very difficult to make decisions based on the feel or wear of the product. Hopefully, the seller will provide with enough details on the item before you click that ADD TO CART button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fraud and/or identity theft&lt;/strong&gt;. Among the millions (if not billions) of those who shop online, many are aware of the possible credit card theft out there. After all, when making purchases, we - as consumers - give out our credit card information, home address, and more to databases on the net. A healthy tip to keep in mind is always ensure that your browser indicates a secure connection when entering personal or payment information.  Do not trust locks or other icons on web pages themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;[[File:E-shopping logo.jpg|thumb|E-shopping logo]]
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Returns&lt;/strong&gt; Another disadvantage for consumers is not being able to see and touch goods in person before purchasing them.  This is definitely a downside to shopping online.  Some click-and mortar stores, such as Old Navy, Best Buy and Barnes &amp; Noble, eliminate this concern by allowing consumers to return merchandise they order online to a local store in order to avoid return shipping charges. 
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spending more money&lt;/strong&gt; An additional disadvantage in shopping online is you may spend more money than you have. If you keep spending money you don’t have, you will have a huge amount of debt. Another disadvantage in e-commerce is you have to wait for your product. Yes, you can get your product cheaper but you have to wait for it to arrive in the mail.

As the industry to e-commerce keeps growing and it may seem that there are many advantages to e-commerce, there are also many disadvantages. 

⋅Many goods cannot be purchased on-line.

⋅E-commerce does not allow buyers to view items in reality.

⋅Ecommerce does not allow buyers to have the item right away; buyers have to wait for the item to be shipped.

⋅An E-commerce website can be setup by anyone.

⋅Some E-commerce websites might not all be secure. Many E-commerce sites can obtain credit card information and may lead to fraud, or identity theft.

⋅E-commerce does not provide that personal help that buyers may have at the actual store.

==== Brief Background ====
Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting millions of people around the world (Doherty, Roddy, Zhang, 2005). In Australia alone, it is estimated that there are approximately 3.85 million people living with osteoarthritis; that is 1 in 5 people with the disorder, with 61.3% of these being women.   In a typical joint, the ends of the bone are covered by a layer of cartilage that protects and cushions the bones.  In osteoarthritis, this cartilage breaks down leaving the bones of the joint unprotected causing friction within the joint which may cause pain and can limit mobility.  While osteoarthritis can affect any joint, the disorder most commonly affects joints in your hands, neck, spine, knees, feet and hips (Doherty, Roddy, Zhang, 2005). 

==== Explanation of the Issue ====

Osteoarthritis is characterised by the following symptoms 
* Swelling, warmth and creaking of the joint 
* Recurring pain with movement 
* Aches from weather changes 
* Pains and stiffness form long periods of inactivity 
* Limited range of motion 
* Muscle weakness 
* An abnormal growth of bony knobs near the joints 


While there is no cure for osteoarthritis, there is multiple lifestyle modifications that can be made to delay the onset and reduce the effects of osteoarthritis.  Along with dietary changes, an increase in activity levels may help individuals manage their symptoms.  Regular exercise may facilitate in the strengthening of the muscles surrounding the joints providing support and stability and improving functional capacity of the individuals.  
Many studies have researched the benefits of aerobic exercise in the management of those with osteoarthritis, finding that if done appropriately, participants reported improvements in each of the following
* Aerobic capacity (Westby 2001)
* Decreased depression and anxiety ( Westby 2001)
* Increased physical activity (Westby 2001)
* Increased muscular strength (Westby 2001)
* Decreased pain (Westby 2001)
* Increase of functionality (Kovar 1992)

 | Image           = Gonarthrose-Knorpelaufbrauch.jpg 
 | Caption         = Osteoarthritis is most commonly found in the knee 
}}

==== Recommendations ====

It is recommended that individuals should:

* Avoid high impact activities that place stress on the joints
* Participate in gentle exercises including walking, biking and swimming, water exercise 
* Since pain may increase with exercise, adequate rest is advised to reduce the likelihood of this, however a compromise between rest and activity needs to be met to ensure that an increase in joint stiffness is not acquired through lack of physical activity
* Incorporate exercise into the daily routine through activities such as vacuuming, house work and gardening
* Start slowly, do 10 minutes of activity at a time, 1 or 2 times a day. Then slowly increase work your physical activity. Aim for at least 2½ hours of moderate activity a week.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{wikipedia|Portal (video game)}}
In this series we'll create a teleportation system similar to the one used in Valve's ''Portal'' game &lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with [[w:Binary_space_partitioning|BSP]] portals.&lt;/ref&gt;.

= Concept =

[[File:Portal physics-2.svg|thumb|Portal teleportation concept]]
We want to implement a teleportation device, where the source and destination are represented as holes in the walls that you can see through. Going in the source portal and out the destination portal should be completely seamless.  It is also possible to place the two portals face to face, like mirrors, to create infinite depth.

The intuitive idea would be to place a second camera and render to texture (as seen in [[../Post-Processing|Post-Processing]]).  However textures are distorted to map the object on which they are attached, especially if you look at it sideways.  Typically they would look like a flat TV screen&lt;ref&gt;You can see a TV-style implementation using Blender presented at [http://www.blendernation.com/2009/08/21/portals-in-game-engine/ BlenderNation] (pointing to a [http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?164382-Portals-Demonstration BlenderArtists.org] post - forum registration needed)&lt;/ref&gt; - but we're talking about PORTALS here!

Since we want a seamless effect, we'll use a different method. The scene will be rendered twice:
* Once as if the player were already teleported, taking into account the player's distance to the portal. We'll clip the scene to the portal's boundaries using the [[../Stencil buffer|Stencil buffer]].
* Once normally, without overwriting the portal by tricking the depth buffer.

To implement the portal we'll need a few prerequisites:
* [[../Modern_OpenGL_Tutorial_Navigation|Matrix transformations]]
* [[../Modern_OpenGL_Tutorial_Load_OBJ|Mesh structure]]
* [[../Stencil buffer|Stencil buffer]]

= Overview =

Here's the points that we'll address to implement our portal system:
* View through portal
** Stencil draw in a distant rectangle
** Stencil draw in rectangle intersection with camera
* Collision detection
* Warp
* Infinite/recursive portals display (portals facing each others)
* Object at 2 locations at the same time (duplicate objects)
* Optimization
* Physics

= Enabling back-face culling =

Drawing the portal will involve drawing the scene from ''behind'' the other portal, so to avoid any issue let's enable back-face culling, to draw front-facing polygons only:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* main() */
    glEnable(GL_CULL_FACE);
&lt;/source&gt;

= Defining the portals =

So we have two portals:
* the source portal (portal1)
* the destination portal (portal2)

We'll represent them as classic Mesh objects (see the [[OpenGL_Programming#The_basics_arc|Basics]] tutorials): a set of vertices to define the portal shape, and a object2world transformation matrix:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* Global */
Mesh portals[2];
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* init_resources() */
  glm::vec4 portal_vertices[] = {
    glm::vec4(-1, -1, 0, 1),
    glm::vec4( 1, -1, 0, 1),
    glm::vec4(-1,  1, 0, 1),
    glm::vec4( 1,  1, 0, 1),
  };
  for (unsigned int i = 0; i &lt; sizeof(portal_vertices)/sizeof(portal_vertices[0]); i++) {
    portals[0].vertices.push_back(portal_vertices[i]);
    portals[1].vertices.push_back(portal_vertices[i]);
  }

  GLushort portal_elements[] = {
    0,1,2, 2,1,3,
  };
  for (unsigned int i = 0; i &lt; sizeof(portal_elements)/sizeof(portal_elements[0]); i++) {
    portals[0].elements.push_back(portal_elements[i]);
    portals[1].elements.push_back(portal_elements[i]);
  }

  // 90° angle + slightly higher
  portals[0].object2world = glm::translate(glm::mat4(1), glm::vec3(0, 1, -2));
  portals[1].object2world = glm::rotate(glm::mat4(1), -90.0f, glm::vec3(0, 1, 0))
    * glm::translate(glm::mat4(1), glm::vec3(0, 1.2, -2));

  portals[0].upload();
  portals[1].upload();
&lt;/source&gt;

= Building a new camera =

[[File:OpenGL Tutorial Portal View.png|thumb|Top view - we want to build C']]
So we need to position a new camera at the portal'''2''' position, and then go backwards to cover the distance from portal'''1''' to the original camera.  Fortunately, it can be done easily by combining the transformation matrices (remember to read matrix multiplications backwards):
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/**
 * Compute a world2camera view matrix to see from portal 'dst', given
 * the original view and the 'src' portal position.
 */
glm::mat4 portal_view(glm::mat4 orig_view, Mesh* src, Mesh* dst) {
  glm::mat4 mv = orig_view * src-&gt;object2world;
  glm::mat4 portal_cam =
    // 3. transformation from source portal to the camera - it's the
    //    first portal's ModelView matrix:
    mv
    // 2. object is front-facing, the camera is facing the other way:
    * glm::rotate(glm::mat4(1.0), 180.0f, glm::vec3(0.0,1.0,0.0))
    // 1. go the destination portal; using inverse, because camera
    //    transformations are reversed compared to object
    //    transformations:
    * glm::inverse(dst-&gt;object2world)
    ;
  return portal_cam;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

We now have a new world2camera (View) matrix.  We can pass it to our shaders to make them render the scene from this new point of view:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* onDisplay */
  glm::mat4 portal_view = portal_view(transforms[MODE_CAMERA], &amp;portals[0], &amp;portals[1]);
  glUniformMatrix4fv(uniform_v, 1, GL_FALSE, v);
  glUniformMatrix4fv(uniform_v_inv, 1, GL_FALSE, glm::value_ptr(glm::inverse(portal_view)));
  main_object.draw();
  ground.draw();
  ...
  /* then reset the view and re-draw the scene as usual */
&lt;/source&gt;

You can do it for the second portal the same way.

= Protecting the portal scene - depth buffer =

Currently we just render the scene twice: from portal2 and from the main camera, but the second rendering overwrites the first.

The trick is to draw the portal in the depth buffer, but without writing it to the colors buffer: OpenGL will understand that something is displayed on the portal, but will not overwrite it with a blank rectangle.

We also take care of saving and restoring the previous color/depth configuration:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  // Draw portal in the depth buffer so they are not overwritten
  glClear(GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);

  GLboolean save_color_mask[4];
  GLboolean save_depth_mask;
  glGetBooleanv(GL_COLOR_WRITEMASK, save_color_mask);
  glGetBooleanv(GL_DEPTH_WRITEMASK, &amp;save_depth_mask);
  glColorMask(GL_FALSE, GL_FALSE, GL_FALSE, GL_FALSE);
  glDepthMask(GL_TRUE);
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; 2; i++)
    portals[i].draw();
  glColorMask(save_color_mask[0], save_color_mask[1], save_color_mask[2], save_color_mask[3]);
  glDepthMask(save_depth_mask);
&lt;/source&gt;

= Clipping the portal scene - stencil buffer =

[[File:Stencil.png|thumb|Color buffer and two successive states of the stencil buffer]]
At first glance, it seems we do not need to clip the portal scene, since we're overwriting its surroundings anyway, and the depth buffer protects the portal already.

However:
* This forces you to rewrite all the scene background with a skybox: you cannot rely on &lt;code&gt;glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)&lt;/code&gt; alone anymore to clear the background, since it may be written to by a portal view, and the main scene won't overwrite that part.
* This is not optimized, since you redraw the full screen even for a tiny bit of portal.
* And above all: when we display the two portals (not just one), the second portal view's depth conflicts with the first's.

Even if we redrew the first portal's depth while rendering the second portal's view, this was meant to protect the portal when rendering the main view - the second portal view may have objects much closer to the camera.  Consequently, the depth buffer is not enough to protect the first portal when drawing the second one.

There are more powerful and relevant ways to protect a part of the screen:
* the scissors (rectangle clipping)
* the stencil buffer (arbitrary clipping)

Since we can look at our portal sideway, or draw it using another shape than a rectangle, the scissors are not enough, so we'll use the stencil buffer.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  glColorMask(GL_FALSE, GL_FALSE, GL_FALSE, GL_FALSE);
  glDepthMask(GL_FALSE);
  glStencilFunc(GL_NEVER, 0, 0xFF);
  glStencilOp(GL_INCR, GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP);  // draw 1s on test fail (always)
  // draw stencil pattern
  glClear(GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT);  // needs mask=0xFF
  glUniformMatrix4fv(uniform_v, 1, GL_FALSE, transforms[MODE_CAMERA]);
  portal-&gt;draw();

  glColorMask(GL_TRUE, GL_TRUE, GL_TRUE, GL_TRUE);
  glDepthMask(GL_TRUE);
  glStencilOp(GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP);
  /* Fill 1 or more */
  glStencilFunc(GL_LEQUAL, 1, 0xFF);
  glUniformMatrix4fv(uniform_v, 1, GL_FALSE, portal_view);
  // -Ready to draw main scene-
&lt;/source&gt;

= Portal collision detection and warp =

{{wikipedia|Line-plane intersection}}
The idea is to detect the intersection between a camera move (a line) and the portal (two triangles).

So we want to write a function that checks whether the line defined by two points &lt;code&gt;la&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;lb&lt;/code&gt; intersect the portal.

Wikipedia to the rescue!

We have a nice matrix ready to compute:
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} t \\ u \\ v \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} x_a - x_b &amp; x_1 - x_0 &amp; x_2 - x_0 \\ y_a - y_b &amp; y_1 - y_0 &amp; y_2 - y_0 \\ z_a - z_b &amp; z_1 - z_0 &amp; z_2 - z_0 \end{bmatrix}^{-1} \begin{bmatrix} x_a - x_0 \\ y_a - y_0 \\ z_a - z_0 \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

* If &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle t \,\in\, [0,\, 1]&lt;/math&gt;, then there's an intersection with the plane.
* If &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle u,\, v \,\in\, [0,\, 1], \; (u \,+\, v) \;\leq\; 1&lt;/math&gt;, then the intersection point is inside the triangle.

To implement it in C++, note that when initializing the matrix, each glm::vec3 is a ''column'' vector, so the values are rotated compared to the mathematic notation.

We also need to add some small values (&lt;code&gt;1e-6&lt;/code&gt;) around the comparisons to make sure there's no floating point precision issue.

It's tempting to work in View coordinates to try and simplify the equations, but if you want to teleport objects later on (a cube? :)), you'll need to work in object coordinates anyway.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/**
 * Checks whether the line defined by two points la and lb intersects
 * the portal.
 */
int portal_intersection(glm::vec4 la, glm::vec4 lb, Mesh* portal) {
  if (la != lb) {  // camera moved
    // Check for intersection with each of the portal's 2 front triangles
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 2; i++) {
      // Portal coordinates in world view
      glm::vec4
	p0 = portal-&gt;object2world * portal-&gt;vertices[portal-&gt;elements[i*3+0]],
	p1 = portal-&gt;object2world * portal-&gt;vertices[portal-&gt;elements[i*3+1]],
	p2 = portal-&gt;object2world * portal-&gt;vertices[portal-&gt;elements[i*3+2]];

      // Solve line-plane intersection using parametric form
      glm::vec3 tuv =
	glm::inverse(glm::mat3(glm::vec3(la.x - lb.x, la.y - lb.y, la.z - lb.z),
			       glm::vec3(p1.x - p0.x, p1.y - p0.y, p1.z - p0.z),
			       glm::vec3(p2.x - p0.x, p2.y - p0.y, p2.z - p0.z)))
	* glm::vec3(la.x - p0.x, la.y - p0.y, la.z - p0.z);
      float t = tuv.x, u = tuv.y, v = tuv.z;

      // intersection with the plane
      if (t &gt;= 0-1e-6 &amp;&amp; t &lt;= 1+1e-6) {
	// intersection with the triangle

&lt;/source&gt;

When this test checks, we warp the camera.  This is very easy because we already know how to compute its transformation matrix with &lt;code&gt;portal_view()&lt;/code&gt;!
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* onIdle() */
  glm::mat4 prev_cam = transforms[MODE_CAMERA];

  // Update camera position depending on keyboard keys
  ...

  /* Handle portals */
  // Movement of the camera in world view
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; 2; i++) {
    glm::vec4 la = glm::inverse(prev_cam) * glm::vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
    glm::vec4 lb = glm::inverse(transforms[MODE_CAMERA]) * glm::vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
    if (portal_intersection(la, lb, &amp;portals[i]))
      transforms[MODE_CAMERA] = portal_view(transforms[MODE_CAMERA], &amp;portals[i], &amp;portals[(i+1)%2]);
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

[[File:OpenGL Tutorial Mini-Portal Non-Recursive.png|thumb|Mini-Portal, non-recursive]]
At this point, you have a basic portal, displaying the view from the brother portal, and teleporting when touched.

However, depending on the speed, you may see the screen flicker just before teleporting.  In the [[../Mini-Portal_Smooth|next section]], we will try to understand what causes this, and how to fix it.

Theorem: Let R be an integral domain and let R[x] be the ring of polynomials in powers of x whose coefficients are elements of R. Then R[x] is an integral domain if and only if R is.

[[User:Efex|Efex]] ([[User talk:Efex|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Efex|contribs]]) 03:10, 5 November 2011 (UTC)

::::::::: I would put that in a gray area, next to &quot;Cameron joins EU financial crisis talks in Brussels&quot; that is already there. They are indeed irrelevant moves to simulate addressing the problem. I had a good laugh when I saw some commentators point out how irrelevance of the UK is on this subject (not part of the euro-zone and was excluded by the three way dialog between France, Germany and Greece, that is already a subversion of a united EU), he was in fact out of the room when the deal was made.
::::::::: The UK has a bigger problem in their hands but no one is talking yet about them (they have invested in the policy of quantitative easing, printing money, devaluing it and passing it later generations). The asinine political move of the Greek PM could have been had extreme results, but the deal has for now survived (the Greek leader survived the vote of confidence by a narrow margin). Had he lost, it would require snap elections, if the deal was delayed or failed to be implemented the state would have collapsed in December.
::::::::: The IMF boost is important but there is not enough money to save for instance the collapse of Italy (the would drag all other already troubled nations Ireland, Portugal, Spain) there is also the silent trouble Cyprus seems to be experiencing. Ultimately all of Europe is indebted, even Germany and globally we are all connected.
::::::::: I am not too optimistic on the outcome and see all moves as a dealing tactic for a real larger war, unless a systemic change is made requiring the adoption of global policies regarding taxation of monetary movements and the end of tax havens and the move forward to if not a federal Europe to a real monetary union that includes the taxation policies.
::::::::: Things could start small but would rapidly turn into a snow ball, 44% of the youth in Spain is unemployed. Remember that the last war had as its undeclared origin the Spanish Civil War (Fascism vs Democracy).
::::::::: So while I share your concerns and am not optimistic, and so see why you seem to chose one type of news I have noted to you that all your selected news are pessimistic in nature. Sorry for the extended response but probably like you I have spent some time thinking about the issues that indeed will affect us all.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 08:27, 5 November 2011 (UTC)

== I'm sorry but...about the page Pinyin-English_News_Summary ==

The Chinese sentences in the page are not fluent. A lot of of them are strange, while some don't make many sense. Many sentences are even not correct. You can find mistakes and errors in most sentences. Few sentence is good enough to be an sample &quot;for learners of Chinese language, can be used as teaching material as well as for self-learning&quot;. That'll be horrible if people really do and use them as if they are correct ones.

...I don't know if I made it clear. In my opinion, the page should be rewritten completely, since once you fix a sentence error, then the Roma transcriptions and the English-Pinyin section are all in need to be fixed to agree with the sentence.

[[User:Rethliopuks|Rethliopuks]] ([[User talk:Rethliopuks|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rethliopuks|contribs]]) 03:26, 4 March 2012 (UTC)

: You may help to improve it and fix the Roman transcriptions and the Pinyin-English section accordingly.  [[User:Efex|Efex]] ([[User talk:Efex|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Efex|contribs]]) 07:50, 4 March 2012 (UTC)

== ASCII tone rendering ==

Is there any chance of switching back to conventional tone marks or numbers? I've never seen this rendering before (except for Shaanxi, obviously) and I doubt many learners have seen it...

The ''Walking With Prehistoric Life'' series, also known as the ''Trilogy Of Life'' series is a collection of United Kingdom television programmes and other shows that are produced by BBC Worldwide and Discovery Channel in association with ProSieben. All of the original programmes are made by Impossible Pictures, a British independent television production company, based in London and founded in 2002 by the creators of the series, Tim Haines and Jasper James. The aim of the series and specials, along with the books is to recreate extinct creatures and presents them as a wildlife documentary. Most of the shows are focus on one individual of a certain species, and those animals are the main characters in each episode.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Ivory Coast=

* &lt;font size=3&gt;A former French colony, the Ivory Coast gained formal independence in 1960.
* All meters are inscribed “COTE D’IVOIRE”.
* The first meters so inscribed appeared in 1958. For issues before this date, see FRENCH WEST AFRICA.
* The stamps are grouped according to country inscription:
:: A - “COTE D’IVOIRE” alone
:: B - “REPUBLIQUE COTE D’IVOIRE” or “REPUBLIQUE DE CODE D’IVOIRE”

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Optimization - the scissors =

We saw that the scissors were not suited for clipping portals, because scissors can only clip a rectangle.  However, scissor clipping is much faster than stencil buffer clipping (it's just a coordinates comparison, rather than a complete screen buffer access).

We can use the scissors to optimize the performances, by doing a first rough clipping, before using the stencil buffer.
This will also allow us to detect when a sub-portal is completely hidden and break from the recursive loop.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Drawing portals-within-portals introduces a new set of corner cases.

= Recursive portals =

Here's the algorithm overview:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* TODO: Code here */
&lt;/source&gt;

= Clipping the portal scene =

[[File:OpenGL Tutorial Stencil Intersect.png|thumb|Shape intersection in the stencil buffer]]
The stencil buffer will be created incrementally:
* draw a portal shape
* draw its intersection with the sub-portal shape to get a new portal clip shape
* repeat

To get the intersection is not straightforward:
* draw the outer portal using GL_INCR
* draw the sub-portal using GL_INCR
* re-draw the outer portal using GL_DECR
* pixels &gt;= 1 represent the intersection between the outer portal and the sub-portal

Technically we could save and restore the buffer at each level of recursion (instead of re-drawing all the portal shapes from scratch), but this would be slow, and retrieving the stencil buffer data is not possible with OpenGL ES 2.

The outer portal and sub-portal are exactly the same object, only the View matrix changes.  So we pass a stack of view to the function, and push a new View matrix with each new level of recursion.

Note that the stencil drawing must support volumetric portals, which means it may be written to more than once (so you cannot achieve intersection using just GL_INVERT).

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
void draw_portal_stencil(vector&lt;glm::mat4&gt; view_stack, Mesh* portal) {
  GLboolean save_color_mask[4];
  GLboolean save_depth_mask;
  glGetBooleanv(GL_COLOR_WRITEMASK, save_color_mask);
  glGetBooleanv(GL_DEPTH_WRITEMASK, &amp;save_depth_mask);

  glColorMask(GL_FALSE, GL_FALSE, GL_FALSE, GL_FALSE);
  glDepthMask(GL_FALSE);
  glStencilFunc(GL_NEVER, 0, 0xFF);
  glStencilOp(GL_INCR, GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP);  // draw 1s on test fail (always)
  // draw stencil pattern
  glClear(GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT);  // needs mask=0xFF
  glUniformMatrix4fv(uniform_v, 1, GL_FALSE, glm::value_ptr(view_stack[0]));
  portal-&gt;draw();
  for (unsigned int i = 1; i &lt; view_stack.size() - 1; i++) {  // -1 to ignore last view
    // Increment intersection for current portal
    glStencilFunc(GL_EQUAL, 0, 0xFF);
    glStencilOp(GL_INCR, GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP);  // draw 1s on test fail (always)
    glUniformMatrix4fv(uniform_v, 1, GL_FALSE, glm::value_ptr(view_stack[i]));
    portal-&gt;draw();
    // Decremental outer portal -&gt; only sub-portal intersection remains
    glStencilFunc(GL_NEVER, 0, 0xFF);
    glStencilOp(GL_DECR, GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP);  // draw 1s on test fail (always)
    glUniformMatrix4fv(uniform_v, 1, GL_FALSE, glm::value_ptr(view_stack[i-1]));
    portal-&gt;draw();
  }

  glColorMask(GL_TRUE, GL_TRUE, GL_TRUE, GL_TRUE);
  glDepthMask(GL_TRUE);
  glStencilOp(GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP);
  /* Fill 1 or more */
  glStencilFunc(GL_LEQUAL, 1, 0xFF);
  glColorMask(save_color_mask[0], save_color_mask[1], save_color_mask[2], save_color_mask[3]);
  glDepthMask(save_depth_mask);
  glUniformMatrix4fv(uniform_v, 1, GL_FALSE, glm::value_ptr(view_stack.back()));
  // -Ready to draw main scene-
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Think about the [[../Stencil_buffer#Debugging|fill_screen trick]] if you need to debug and see what your shape looks like.

__TOC__

= Distributions =
The Tomato firmware distribution is maintained, primarily by Jonathan Zarate at [http://www.polarcloud.com/ Polar Cloud] as a derivation of LinkSys's open-source code. Tomato is built in two flavors, a standard version that should run on all routers and the &quot;New Driver&quot; (ND) version for newer routers. &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Warning! Loading an ND version on an unsupported router could [[w:Brick_(electronics)|brick]] the router.&lt;/font&gt; 

As such, others have further derived new distributions, named by the authors' usernames in the &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.linksysinfo.org/forums&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linksysinfo.org/forums/showthread.php?t=57933 List of Tomato mods]&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Teddy Bear Mod ===

Latest version: 30 November 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://tomatousb.org/changelog Teddy Bear's TomatoUSB Changelog]&lt;/ref&gt; (as of December 20, 2010), available for download from [http://tomatousb.org/download Tomatousb.org/download].

Currently based on the 1.28 build of Tomato, this is the list of changes made to official Tomato ND (New Driver):
* Support for USB 1.1 (OHCI and UHCI) and USB 2.0, configurable via Tomato GUI.
* USB storage (Ext2/Ext3, FAT/FAT32 and NTFS filesystems) and USB printing support.
* Auto-mounting for USB drives (added in v05). When this feature is activated in the GUI, and USB drive is plugged in, all mountable partitions will be automatically mounted to a directory under /mnt. If you want to override default mount point, mount your partition manually in the satrtup, wanup, or hotplug script, i.e.:  mount -o noatime,nodev /dev/discs/disc0/part1 /opt, or by using /etc/fstab file and &quot;mount -a&quot; command.  If you mount the partition manually, it will not be re-mounted to a default mount point. If after mounting the drive you want to execute some additional scripts - to run the programs etc - it's a good idea to add several seconds sleep before doing so.
* Support for /etc/fstab, and mounting by label and UUID.
* Network File Sharing using built-in Samba server 2.0.10. Please check this post if you're experiencing problems copying files to Samba shares, and this post if you have issues with authenticated access to Samba shares.
* Printer server (p910nd) is included and started automatically if you enable printing support. Bidirectional copying can be disabled via GUI if it causes problems with your printer. Only one instance of printer server is started automatically, and listens on port 9100. If you need to support more than 1 printer, add commands to run additional instances of p910nd to your startup script. Follow these directions to set up your printer in Windows.
* USB Hotplug script - it can be useful for configuring USB devices after connecting them to the router or on boot-up, for example loading firmware into HP1018 or similar printer (there're some posts on page 11 of this thread with more details about HP1018 printer).
* Fixed slow running clock problem on Asus WL-520GU. After flashing this firmware you have to reboot the router at least once for clock to get fixed (this fix is included into official Tomato releases starting from Tomato 1.24).
* Fixed WLAN LED on Asus WL-520GU, SES button and WLAN led on Asus WL500gP v1 and Buffalo WBR2-G54 (these fixes are included into official Tomato releases starting from Tomato 1.24).
* Built-in FTP server daemon (vsftpd) with GUI.
* L7 filter patterns are updated to the latest official version (2009-05-28), removed experimental rtp-2 pattern.
* Added CGI scripts support to HTTP daemon - you can place your CGI scripts into &quot;/www/ext/cgi-bin&quot; folder, and they will be executed when you access them via &lt;nowiki&gt;http://&lt;router_ip&gt;/ext/cgi-bin/my_script_name&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
* Included SpeedMod by Rodney H.
* Added new &quot;NAT Target&quot; setting to &quot;Advanced -&gt; Firewall&quot; (SNAT or MASQUERADE).
* Upgraded Broadcom Wireless driver to version 4.158.4.0.
* UPnP daemon is replaced with MiniUPnPd with NAT-PMP support (MiniUPnPd is included into official Tomato releases starting from Tomato 1.24. This mod however adds additional GUI settings for UPnP). UPnP is disabled by default, NAT-PMP is enabled by default.
* Added new &quot;Regulatory Mode&quot; setting (off|g|h) and &quot;Country/Region&quot; setting to &quot;Advanced -&gt; Wireless&quot;.
* Added wireless auto channel selection.
* Changed to use passive mode for wireless scan (generally should pick up more APs).
* Replaced JFFS2 filesystem driver by JFFS ver 1.3 from ray123 to provide more available JFFS space.
* Replaced ramfs by tmpfs.
* Updated busybox and dnsmasq.
The mod (starting from build 20) comes in 4 different flavours:

; Standard: all standard features described above; ~180KB JFFS space (3 blocks) available on 4MB flash routers;
; Extras: all features of Standard plus Linux Ext2/Ext3 and FAT32 filesystem utilities (fdisk, e2fsck, mke2fs, mkswap, mkdosfs), built-in loop device support, additional color schemes. ~60KB JFFS space (1 block) available on 4MB flash. This version is for people who don't really need JFFS space, or have 8MB flash routers, and would like to be able to partition/format drives in Linux native Ext2/Ext3 format or in FAT32 format directly on the router without installing any additional tools.
; Lite: all features of Standard but no Samba; some very minor features are stripped out of Busybox, about 540KB JFFS space (9 blocks) available on 4MB flash routers;
; No CIFS: all features of Standard but no CIFS Network filesystem support, about 300KB JFFS space (5 blocks) available on 4MB flash routers;

=== Toastman Mod ===

Latest version; 9 Mar 2012&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linksysinfo.org/index.php?forums/tomato-firmware.33/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Toastman-RT-1.28.7496.2-RT MIPSR2 K2.6 for RT-N16 etc.

VLAN builds include the VLAN-GUI by Augusto Bott and experimental Multi-SSID.

CPU frequency display, CPU % useage, CPU Overclock menu.

Static ARP Binding, Bandwidth Limiter per client, 

Significant improvements to Tomato's QOS includes new IMQ based ingress system with class priorities, and an incoming class bandwidth pie chart, making it much easier to evaluate QOS rule effectiveness.

Configurable QOS class names, comprehensive example QOS rules loaded as default. Many useful features/tools for easier administration of networks.

Up to 250 clients in Static DHCP, Access Restrictions, 500 in Wireless Restrictions. Suitable for large installations such as hotels and condominiums as well as the normal user.

===Linksys WRT54G-TM===
The WRT54G-TM (TM stands for [[T-Mobile]]) is also called the T-Mobile &quot;[[HotSpot_@Home#Unlimited_HotSpot_Calling_and_.40Home|Hotspot@Home]]&quot; service.  It allows calls to be made via T-Mobile's [[GSM]] network or via WiFi [[Unlicensed Mobile Access]] (UMA), using the same telephone and phone number (a special dual-mode phone designed for the service is required e.g. [[BlackBerry Pearl|Blackberry Pearl 8120]]). Additionally, once a call is in progress, one may transition from WiFi to GSM (and vice versa) seamlessly, as WiFi signal comes and goes, such as when entering or exiting a home or business. A special router is not needed to use the service, but the T-Mobile branded routers are supposed to enhance the telephone's battery life. This is the only known tweak to the TM version of the firmware. The hardware appears to be like WRT54GL however has 32MB ram and 8MB flash.

The WRT54G-TM having a serial number that starts with C061 has these specifications:
* Broadcom BCM5352EKPBG CPU
*32 MB RAM (Hynix HY5DU561622ETP-D43)
*8 MB Flash (JS28f640)
*Uses the same BINs that the WRT54GS v3.0 does

| First Flash manually via TFTP. Here's how: Download the Tomato firmware. Open a command prompt and 'cd' to the directory where you downloaded the firmware (.trx file). Type 'tftp -i 192.168.1.1 PUT Tomato.trx' but DO NOT HIT ENTER! Unplug the power to the router. Hold down the reset/restore button while reconnecting the power. Wait until the power light starts blinking before releasing the reset/restore button. Hit enter in your command prompt window (to run 'tftp -i 192.168.1.1 PUT Tomato.trx'). Wait 15-30 seconds for the image to upload. If you receive a TFTP timeout message start the process over again (from step 3). Wait 4-5 minutes and power cycle the router.

| For initial flash from stock firmware a special image is required. It is recommended to flash first to Motorola firmware 6.1.4, and continue with the Tomato afterwards. 
 
The default Motorola CFE (Common Firmware Environment - so called bootloader) might have problem with reverting the router to default settings. It is recommended to modify the CFE in a way that it will be able to revert to default settings and switch on the boot_wait flag in order to enable TFTP recovery method.

      <comment>/* GROUP B: Period of Soviet Union occupation, 1940 – 1991 */ --~~~~</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=Lithuania=

*&lt;font size=3&gt; Lithuania was an independent country until the German and Soviet Union occupations which began in 1941. No meter stamps distinctly identified to the German occupation are known. From 1941 until Lithuania regained its independence after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, meter stamps of the Soviet Union (USSR) were used. 
* All stamps are inscribed “LIETUVA” or “LIETUVOS” or are without country inscription but have a Lithuanian town mark or other identifying feature.
* The stamps are grouped according to political period:
:: A - Period of independence, 1933 to early in World War Two
:: B - Period of Soviet Union occupation, 1940 – 1991
:: C - Period of independence, 1991 to present

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Soviet Union''' (Советский Союз, in Russian, also known in English as the ''USSR'') was a country which existed in eastern Europe and northern Asia between 1922 and 1991.  It shared borders with [[../Poland|Poland]], Czechoslovakia (now [[../Slovakia|Slovakia]], [[../Finland|Finland]], [[../Turkey|Turkey]], [[../Norway|Norway]], [[../Hungary|Hungary]], [[../Romania|Romania]], Iran, Mongolia, North Korea, Afghanistan and China.  The capital city was '''[[w:Moscow|Moscow]]'''.  Other big cities in the USSR were St. Petersburg, Kiev and Minsk.  The USSR was not a part of the [[../EU|European Union]] but since the country split up Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have become EU members.  The USSR's currency was called the '''Soviet Ruble'''.

The USSR consisted of the following present-day countries: [[../Russia|Russia]], [[../Georgia|Georgia]], [[../Ukraine|Ukraine]], [[../Moldova|Moldova]], [[../Belarus|Belarus]], [[../Armenia|Armenia]], [[../Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]], [[../Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]], Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan.  The USSR also occupied the Baltic states of [[../Estonia|Estonia]], [[../Latvia|Latvia]] and [[../Lithuania|Lithuania]] between World War II and the break up of the Soviet Union but most countries considered the occupation to be illegal.

==The Soviet Union's History==

[[File:Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics_(orthographic_projection).svg|thumb|200px|right|Map showing the location of the USSR]]
[[File:Flag_of_the_Soviet_Union.svg|thumb|200px|right|The national flag of the Soviet Union]]
[[File:1991_coup_attempt1.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Tanks on the streets of Moscow during the Soviet Union's break up in 1991]]
The '''1917 October Revolution''' overthrew the provisional Russian government and the tsar monarchy and revolutionaries led by the Bolshevik leader '''Vladimir Lenin''' took control.

Between the mid-1920s and early-1950s the leader was '''Josef Stalin''' who was responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths by starving in Ukraine and the murder and exile of large numbers of the population who were against him.  During World War II the USSR was allied with the United Kingdom and France (and later the United States).  The USSR was invaded by Germany resulting in huge numbers of deaths - possibly 20 million Soviet people were killed during World War II - more than in any other conflict ever.

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|End of the Soviet Union|After 1991 the 15 parts of the Soviet Union became independent countries which today include Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Russia and many other countries}}
==The Soviet Union's Geography==

The Soviet Union was '''the world's biggest country'''.  Today, Russia remains the biggest country in the world.  The Soviet Union spread from central Europe to the far east of Asia.  West to east was over 10,000 kilometres and the country contained 11 time zones.

The USSR's highest mountain, at 7,496 metres, was '''Communism Peak''' (now known as [[w:Ismail Samani Peak|Ismail Samani Peak]], in Tajikistan).
==The Soviet Union's People==

In 1991 there were '''294,000,000 people''' in the USSR, 51% of whom were ethnic Russians who speak the [[Wikijunior:Languages/Russian|Russian]] language, the official language if the country.  Other common languages included Ukrainian, Georgian, Kazakh, Armenian and Azerbaijani.

The USSR was officially an '''[[Wikijunior:World Religions/Atheism|Atheist]] country''' but many people continued to practice their [[Wikijunior:World Religions/Christianity|Christian]] (mostly Russian Orthodox) and [[Wikijunior:World Religions/Islam|Muslim]] faiths.

==The Soviet Union's Sights==

There were '''many [[Wikijunior:World Heritage Sites|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]]''' in the USSR: Red Square and the Kremlin in Moscow, L'viv in Ukraine and many others.  Because of the Cold War few tourists visited the Soviet Union until the end of communism.

==Prevention for Alzheimer's Disease==
''Physical Activity/Exercise and Diet''

Regular exercise through mid-life reduces risk of AD by 60% &lt;ref name=&quot;Kivipelto&quot;&gt;Kivipelto, M. and Solomon, A. (2007) Alzheimer's Disease - The Ways of Prevention. The ''Journal of Nutrition, Health and Aging''; 12: 89S-94S.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Vascular diseases such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes and strokes have been found to have an association with AD. Regular exercise has been shown to decrease the risk of vascular diseases and therefore can help delay the symptoms of AD by &lt;ref name=&quot;Lange&quot;&gt;Lange-Asschenfeldt, C. and Kojda G. (2008) Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular dysfunction and the benefits of exercise: From vessels to neurons. ''Experimental Gerontology''; 43: 499-504.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pope&quot;&gt;Pope, SK et al. (2003) Will A Healthy Lifestyle Help Prevent Alzheimer's Disease. ''Annual Review of Public Health''; 24: 111-132&lt;/ref&gt;.
* Directly counteracting vascular oxidative stress seen in AD patients and
* Indirectly by reducing the vascular burden – a critical factor for AD onset. 


Life-style changes such as completing [http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/health-pubhlth-strateg-phys-act-guidelines regular exercise] and [http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/health-pubhlth-strateg-food-guide-index.htm eating a balanced diet] throughout a person’s mid-life can help delay the onset of cognitive decline and slow down AD progression &lt;ref name=&quot;Pope&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rolland&gt; Rolland, Y et al. (2008). Physical activity and Alzheimer’s disease: From prevention to therapeutic perspectives. Journal of American Medical Directors Association, 9, 390-405.&lt;/ref&gt;. 


''Exercise Prescription''

There is no physical activity/exercise specifically for AD.  [http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/health-pubhlth-strateg-phys-act-guidelines General physical activity guidelines] would be appropriate to reduce vascular risks associated with AD. Additional research suggests that the risk of cognitive decline decreased twofold in patients who completed greater than 1 hour of exercise&lt;ref name=&quot;Rolland&quot; /&gt; daily at a high to moderate intensity level is associated with a decrease risk of AD&lt;ref name=Scameas&gt;Scarmeas, N and Stern, Y (2004). Cognitive reserve: Implications for diagnosis and prevention of Alzheimer’s disease. Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep, 4(5), 374-380.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Want to Help Someone with Alzheimer’s Disease?==

Throughout the course of AD patients can develop malnutrition, increased rate of falls, fractures, muscle loss, behavioural disturbances and depression. This can result in a decreased quality of life, independence and, high rate hospitalisation, disability and death &lt;ref name=&quot;Santana&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Radak&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rolland&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Teri&gt;Teri, L et al. (1998) Exercise and activity level in Alzheimer’s disease: A potential treatment focus. Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development, 35(4), 411-419.&lt;/ref&gt;.

''Benefits of Physical Activity/Exercise''

Regular exercise in AD patients can significantly improve their ability to complete every day activities such as cleaning, cooking, hanging washing out (etc).  To improve quality of life, ability to complete every day activities, decrease the risk of diseases (i.e. hypertension, diabetes) an AD exercise program should include&lt;ref name=&quot;Santana&quot; /&gt;:
* Aerobic/endurance activities,
* Flexibility,
* Neuromuscular coordination/balance and
* Strength of the major muscle groups.
Research has suggested moderate exercise program of one hour conducted twice a week significantly slows the progressive deterioration by up to a 1/3&lt;ref name=Rolland1&gt;Rolland, Y  et al. (2007).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is COPD?==
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) includes two respiratory conditions called Emphysema and Chronic Bronchitis, both of which are most commonly caused by long-term smoking, and typically affecting the population of 50 years and above.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Australian Lung Foundation&quot;&gt;[http://www.lungnet.com.au The Australian Lung Foundation].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Emphysema refers to damage to the alveoli resulting in difficulty breathing&lt;ref name=&quot;Pamphlet&quot;&gt;The Australian Lung Foundation. (2003). ''COPD:Chronic Bronchitis and Emphysema Pamphlet''. Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Chronic Bronchitis is inflammation of the bronchi which causes mucus to build up in the airways resulting in a cough and sputum production&lt;ref name=&quot;Pamphlet&quot; /&gt;
COPD is the third most prominent chronic illness in Australia with approximately two million people in the country being affected, and millions of dollars being contributed in health costs each year. &lt;ref name=&quot;A Patient Guide&quot;&gt;Queensland Government (Queensland Health) and The Australian Lung Foundation. (2008). ''Better Living with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease:A Patient Guide''.

==How can COPD be Managed?==
There are a number of lifestyle changes that can be made in order to manage your COPD better. These include:
* Joining a pulmonary rehabilitation program&lt;ref name=&quot;A Patient Guide&quot; /&gt;
* Quitting smoking&lt;ref name=&quot;A Patient Guide&quot; /&gt;
* Sustaining a healthy diet&lt;ref name=&quot;A Patient Guide&quot; /&gt;
* Understanding the dosage requirements and role of medications&lt;ref name=&quot;A Patient Guide&quot; /&gt;

==How does medication effect exercise?==
There is a range of medications that can be taken to treat symptoms of COPD depending on severity. Each medication has their own side effects that need to be monitored during exercise:
*Short acting Bronchodilators (e.g. Ventolin) open up the airways to allow for an increased exercise capacity. However, they can cause increased heart rate and unsteady fine muscle movements. Therefore, the patient needs to exercise at a lower intensity and be aware that their fine muscles will be slightly weaker than normal. &lt;ref name=&quot;A Patient Guide&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;COPD Information Pack&quot;&gt;[http://www.mhcs.health.nsw.gov.au/publication_pdfs/8095/AHS-8095-ENG.pdf COPD Informtaion Pack],&lt;/ref&gt;
*Inhaled steroids aid in the reduction of mucus production and swelling of the airways. When used over a long period of time can cause osteoporosis. While there are not many modifications that can be made to the exercise program, the patient needs to be aware of falls prevention during their sessions. &lt;ref name=&quot;A Patient Guide&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=medsafe&gt;[http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/profs/puarticles/2.htm medsafe]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;COPD Information Pack&quot;&gt;[http://www.mhcs.health.nsw.gov.au/publication_pdfs/8095/AHS-8095-ENG.pdf COPD Informtaion Pack],&lt;/ref&gt;
*Systemic steroids also reduce the swelling in the airways however they are mostly used in severe cases where inhaled steroids are unable to enter the lung. Adverse effects include insomnia, weight gain, bruise easily, osteoporosis, muscle weakness and decreased vision. The patient needs to be aware that insomnia can lead to clumsiness which can increase the risk of injury. This then has implications for the bruising easily osteoporosis, muscle weakness and decreased vision. &lt;ref name=&quot;A Patient Guide&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;COPD Information Pack&quot;&gt;[http://www.mhcs.health.nsw.gov.au/publication_pdfs/8095/AHS-8095-ENG.pdf COPD Informtaion Pack],&lt;/ref&gt;

==What is Pulmonary Rehabilitation?==
* Pulmonary Rehabilitation is a program organised by The Australian Lung Foundation, and run by a team of medical professionals for people with chronic lung conditions
* It is a combination of exercise and education sessions run over a period of eight weeks
* It aims to increase your ability to perform daily tasks and improve the capacity to participate in physical activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Australian Lung Foundation&quot; /&gt;

==What does it involve?==
* The program is delivered twice a week with:
**Education sessions to provide information on how to manage life with a chronic lung disease
**A standard exercise program where each person is encouraged to work within their own limits
* A session will typically involve a low intensity form of cardiovascular activity. For example, a 30 minute walk followed by strength and balance exercises with relevance to daily activities&lt;ref name=&quot;Beth&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Forbes, COPD Nurse Specialist, Chronic Care Program, The Canberra Hospital&lt;/ref&gt;

==What are the benefits of a Pulmonary Rehabilitation program?==
*Improved lung capacity&lt;ref name=&quot;Beth&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;A Patient Guide&quot; /&gt;
*Stronger bones&lt;ref name=&quot;Beth&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;A Patient Guide&quot; /&gt;
*Increased mood&lt;ref name=&quot;Beth&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;A Patient Guide&quot; /&gt;
*Social opportunities&lt;ref name=&quot;Beth&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;A Patient Guide&quot; /&gt;
*Independence&lt;ref name=&quot;Beth&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;A Patient Guide&quot; /&gt;
*Sense of control over illness&lt;ref name=&quot;Beth&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;A Patient Guide&quot; /&gt;
*Improved quality of life&lt;ref name=&quot;Beth&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;A Patient Guide&quot; /&gt;

      <comment>/* The issue */ Changed &quot;...we need to understand how to OpenGL camera works.&quot; to &quot;we need to understand how the OpenGL camera works.&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''(Work In Progress)'''

In the [[../Mini-Portal|previous section]], we implemented a basic working portal system.

One annoying issue is the flicker we experience when passing the portal.  Let's see how to fix it.

= The issue =

[[File:Field of view angle in view frustum.png|thumb|The camera frustum|400px]]

To understand the flicker, we need to understand how the OpenGL camera works.

When we position the camera using its transformation matrix, we do not really position the screen itself.  As we can see on the figure, the OpenGL camera is a truncated pyramid (a ''frustum'', in maths slang).  We defined it with &lt;code&gt;glm::perspective&lt;/code&gt; when setting the Projection matrix in the &lt;code&gt;onIdle&lt;/code&gt; function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  // Projection
  glm::mat4 camera2screen = glm::perspective(
    45.0f,                            // FOVy
    1.0f*screen_width/screen_height,  // aspect ratio
    0.1f,                             // zNear
    100.0f                            // zFar
  );
&lt;/source&gt;

The perspective matrix takes all objects between &lt;code&gt;zNear&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;zFar&lt;/code&gt;, and project them on the near clipping plane.  It does not display at all what is between the camera position and the near clipping plane.

The flicker happens when the camera is at a distance less than &lt;code&gt;zNear&lt;/code&gt; to the portal: in that case the camera position is before the portal, but the screen is behind already!  The flicker is actually a quick flash of the scene behind the portal, just before we teleport the camera.

= The fix =

The intuitive idea is the teleport ahead of time: if the camera comes at a distance of &lt;code&gt;zNear&lt;/code&gt; close to the portal, we could teleport it straight away.  This works well when facing the portal - but what about when we strafe (move sideway) through the portal?  The problem will not be fixed in that case.

The real problem is mainly in the stencil buffer, given that it defines the drawn portal scene parts.  The stencil buffer is built by rendering the portal onto it, and so is affected by the camera near clipping plane moving beyond the portal.  If we can keep drawing on the stencil buffer when the camera's near clipping plane is behind it, we've won.

The fix we propose in this document is to make the portal volumetric, matching the volume bounded  by the camera position and the near clipping plane. As the near clipping plane passes behind the portal front-face, a tailored back-face will appear and be rendered to the stencil buffer.  In all directions.

Basically it's all about cheating; but we've been cheating from the start :)

== Modifying zNear ==

There is still a slight issue: even if the near clipping plane is in the portal volumetric shape, there may be things inside the portal, typically the ground.

A more complete fix would be to draw the stencil buffer more precisely by computing the intersection between the portal volume and the camera near clipping rectangle.

But normally, you apply the portal on a wall, so there shouldn't be anything at all behind it.

In our demo, the ground issue can be fixed using a reasonably small value for &lt;code&gt;zNear&lt;/code&gt;, such as &lt;code&gt;0.01&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* Global */
static float zNear = 0.01;
static float fovy = 45;
&lt;/source&gt;

With this value the ground can only be slightly noticed if the player passes the portal while looking at its feet.

It is tempting to set &lt;code&gt;zNear&lt;/code&gt; to a really small value, such as &lt;code&gt;0.000001&lt;/code&gt;.  However, if zNear is too small compared to &lt;code&gt;zFar&lt;/code&gt;, the depth buffer will lose its precision.  You will then notice a flicker in your meshes, because triangles will alternatively be drawn one in front of the other.  So don't :)

Modifying &lt;code&gt;zNear&lt;/code&gt; will come in handy when developping our fix, because we can set it to a large value such as &lt;code&gt;1.0&lt;/code&gt; to have a clearer view of the near clipping plane postponement.

== Drawing the volumetric portal ==

TODO: explain maths

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
void create_portal(Mesh* portal, int screen_width, int screen_height, float zNear, float fovy) {
  portal-&gt;vertices.clear();
  portal-&gt;elements.clear();

  float aspect = 1.0 * screen_width / screen_height;
  float fovy_rad = fovy * M_PI / 180;
  float fovx_rad = fovy_rad / aspect;
  float dz = max(zNear/cos(fovx_rad), zNear/cos(fovy_rad));
  float dx = tan(fovx_rad) * dz;
  float dy = tan(fovy_rad) * dz;
  glm::vec4 portal_vertices[] = {
    glm::vec4(-1, -1, 0, 1),
    glm::vec4( 1, -1, 0, 1),
    glm::vec4(-1,  1, 0, 1),
    glm::vec4( 1,  1, 0, 1),

    glm::vec4(-(1+dx), -(1+dy), 0-dz, 1),
    glm::vec4( (1+dx), -(1+dy), 0-dz, 1),
    glm::vec4(-(1+dx),  (1+dy), 0-dz, 1),
    glm::vec4( (1+dx),  (1+dy), 0-dz, 1),
  };
  for (unsigned int i = 0; i &lt; sizeof(portal_vertices)/sizeof(portal_vertices[0]); i++) {
    portal-&gt;vertices.push_back(portal_vertices[i]);
  }
  GLushort portal_elements[] = {
    0,1,2, 2,1,3,
    4,5,6, 6,5,7,
    0,4,2, 2,4,6,
    5,1,7, 7,1,3,
  };
  for (unsigned int i = 0; i &lt; sizeof(portal_elements)/sizeof(portal_elements[0]); i++) {
    portal-&gt;elements.push_back(portal_elements[i]);
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

We see that the portal depends on screen_width and screen_height (for the perspective aspect ratio).  Consequently we need to rebuild the portal shape when the OpenGL window is resized - let's modify GLUT's ''reshape'' callback:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
void onReshape(int width, int height) {
  screen_width = width;
  screen_height = height;
  glViewport(0, 0, screen_width, screen_height);
  create_portal(&amp;portals[0], screen_width, screen_height, zNear, fovy);
  create_portal(&amp;portals[1], screen_width, screen_height, zNear, fovy);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=='''Definitions'''==
====Type 1 Diabetes:==== 
Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease in which the beta cells of the pancreas are destroyed and cannot produce insulin, the hormone that is responsible for the uptake of glucose from the blood&lt;ref&gt;Powers, S.K., Howley, E.T. (2009). Exercise Physiology: Theory and applications to fitness and performance 7th edition. Mcgraw-Hill Companies, Inc. New York&lt;/ref&gt;. Type 1 diabetes accounts for around 10 to 15% of all diabetics with over 16 million people worldwide diagnosed with the disease&lt;ref&gt;Guelfi, K.J., Jones, T.W. &amp; Fournier, P.A. 2007, &quot;New insights into managing the risk of hypoglycaemia associated with intermittent high-intensity exercise in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus: implications for existing guidelines&quot;, Sports Medicine, vol. 37, no. 11, pp. 937-946&lt;/ref&gt;. Regular insulin injections are required to increase the amount of glucose extracted from the blood and utilized within the body for energy.

====Hypoglycemia:==== 
Hypoglycemia is a state of low blood glucose in which circulating blood glucose levels drop below 3.5 mmol/l&lt;ref&gt;Cryer, P.E., Davis, S.N. &amp; Shamoon, H. 2003, &quot;Hypoglycemia in diabetes&quot;, Diabetes care, vol. 26, no. 6, pp. 1902&lt;/ref&gt;. Hypoglycemia may occur as a result of excessive insulin dosages, low glucose intake eg: missing a meal or not eating enough carbohydrates and/or participating in prolonged or unplanned exercise&lt;ref&gt;Guelfi, K.J., Jones, T.W. &amp; Fournier, P.A. 2007, &quot;New insights into managing the risk of hypoglycaemia associated with intermittent high-intensity exercise in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus: implications for existing guidelines&quot;, Sports Medicine, vol. 37, no. 11, pp. 937-946&lt;/ref&gt;. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to seizures,coma and death.

&lt;b&gt;Symptoms of hypoglycemia include:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cryer, P.E., Davis, S.N. &amp; Shamoon, H. 2003, &quot;Hypoglycemia in diabetes&quot;, Diabetes care, vol. 26, no. 6, pp. 1902. &lt;/ref&gt;

* Shaking, Trembling &amp; Quivering
* Abnormal Heart Beat
* Anxiety &amp; Arousal
* Paleness &amp; Sweating 
* Increased Appetite 
* Tingling &amp; Numbness
* Increased Body Temperature
* Weakness &amp; Fatigue
* Confusion 
* Behavioural changes
* Involuntary Crying

=='''Exercise Complications'''==
Participation in exercise generally increases the risk for type 1 diabetics to develop hypoglycemia during exercise and up to 24 hours after completion&lt;ref&gt;Ertl, A. &amp; Davis, S. 2004, &quot;Evidence for a vicious cycle of exercise and hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, Diabetes/metabolism research and reviews, vol. 20, no. 2, pp. 124-130&lt;/ref&gt;. The body becomes more sensitive towards insulin causing insulin to be utilized at a greater rate, this can lead to an abrupt drop in blood glucose levels. In healthy individuals the body has mechanisms that counteract this problem these are known as counterregulatory responses. Healthy counterregulatory responses to lowering blood glucose levels show a decrease in insulin production and an increase the production and release of glucose. In type 1 diabetics these counterregulatory responses are diminished as the body is not able to decrease the amount of synthetic insulin administered via injections, glucose raising responses are also weakened in type 1 diabetics&lt;ref&gt;Briscoe, V.J.B.V.J., Tate, D.B.T.D.B. &amp; Davis, S.N.D.S.N. 2007, &quot;Type 1 diabetes: exercise and hypoglycemia&quot;, Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism, vol. 32, no. 3, pp. 576-582&lt;/ref&gt;. In saying this individuals should not be limited in regards to sport participation and can partake in exercise with simple manipulations of insulin injections, carbohydrate intake and exercise intensity while regularly monitoring blood glucose levels to help maintain adequate blood glucose control&lt;ref&gt;Powers, S.K., Howley, E.T. (2009). Exercise Physiology: Theory and applications to fitness and performance 7th edition. Mcgraw-Hill Companies, Inc. New York&lt;/ref&gt;.

=='''Exercise Recommendations'''==
====Insulin Administration====
As mentioned above type 1 diabetics have impaired counterregulatory responses to exercise and therefore are unable to lower the amount of synthetic insulin circulating within the body, therefore it is important to reduce the amount of insulin injected to offset this problem. The total amount of insulin reduced relies on many factors these include: duration and intensity of exercise, blood glucose and insulin levels and environmental factors&lt;ref&gt;Toni, S., Reali, M.F., Barni, F., Lenzi, L. &amp; Festini, F. 2006, &quot;Managing insulin therapy during exercise in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, Acta Biomed, vol. 77, no. suppl 1, pp. 34-40&lt;/ref&gt;. General guidelines for insulin administration prior to exercise involve:&lt;ref&gt;Rabasa-Lhoret, R., Bourque, J., Ducros, F. &amp; Chiasson, J.L. 2001, &quot;Guidelines for premeal insulin dose reduction for postprandial exercise of different intensities and durations in type 1 diabetic subjects treated intensively with a basal-bolus insulin regimen (ultralente-lispro)&quot;, Diabetes care, vol. 24, no. 4, pp. 625.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Toni, S., Reali, M.F., Barni, F., Lenzi, L. &amp; Festini, F. 2006, &quot;Managing insulin therapy during exercise in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, Acta Biomed, vol. 77, no. suppl 1, pp. 34-40.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Injecting insulin into the subcutaneous fat layer underneath the skin in either the abdomen or non exercising muscle. 
* Lowering the pre-meal insulin dosages by 25-75%.
* Lowering the pre-meal insulin dosages by 70-80% if exercise is long in duration &gt;90minutes.
* Lowering the rapid pre-meal insulin dosage by 30-50% if exercise is up to 4hours in duration.
* Lowering the pre meal insulin dosages by 70-90% in team sports, this may not be necessary if duration is less than 60minutes.
As mentioned these are only guidelines, the exact insulin adjustments should be made on an individual basis via the use of a trial and error approach.

====Carbohydrate Intake====
Similar to insulin administration, carbohydrate intake should be altered prior to exercise. Insulin becomes more effective as a result of exercise and as previously stated the body is unable to alter the synthetic amount of insulin administered within the body therefore as glucose levels decline insulin levels will not decrease accordingly resulting in an increase in glucose utilization and potential hypoglycemia. This problem can be counteracted by:&lt;ref&gt;Coker, R.H., Koyama, Y., Denny, J.C., Camacho, R.C., Lacy, D.B. &amp; Wasserman, D.H. 2002, &quot;Prevention of overt hypoglycemia during exercise&quot;, Diabetes, vol. 51, no. 5, pp. 1310.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Consuming low glycemic index (GI) foods
* Consuming a carbohydrate rich snack 3 hours prior to exercise. 
* Consuming extra carbohydrates during prologned exercise
* Consuming post-exercise carbohydrates within 30 minutes of exercise completion.
* Always carrying a carbohydrate rich snack or drink while exercising.

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Carbohydrate intake recommendations:&lt;/b&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Exercise stage     !! Carbohydrate (CHO) intake !! Example's
|-
| Prior || 15g CHO per 30minutes exercise. || 1 bannana&lt;br&gt;1/2 cup cooked pasta&lt;br&gt;1 glass fruit juice
|-
| During || 60-80g CHO per 1hour exercise or&lt;br&gt;1g per kg of body weight per 1hour exercise || 1 musli/sports bar&lt;br&gt;1-2 sports gels&lt;br&gt;500ml Gatorade/Powerade  
|-
| After || 1.5g of CHO per kg of body weight post exercise repeat after 2 hours || Multigrain sandwiches&lt;br&gt;Pasta/Rice&lt;br&gt;Fresh fruit&lt;br&gt;DO NOT drink alcohol
|}

====Exercise Prescription====
Exercise can have a major role on blood glucose levels as the body relies mainly on carbohydrates during high intensity exercise for a fuel source&lt;ref&gt;Powers, S.K., Howley, E.T. (2009). Exercise Physiology: Theory and applications to fitness and performance 7th edition. Mcgraw-Hill Companies, Inc. New York&lt;/ref&gt; this can cause rapid depletion of blood glucose levels if insulin injection and carbohydrate intake are not modified. General exercise prescriptions to avoid abrupt decreases in blood glucose levels include:&lt;ref&gt;Galassetti, P., Mann, S., Tate, D., Neill, R.A., Wasserman, D.H. &amp; Davis, S.N. 2001, &quot;Effect of morning exercise on counterregulatory responses to subsequent, afternoon exercise&quot;, Journal of applied physiology, vol. 91, no. 1, pp. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guelfi, K.J., Jones, T.W. &amp; Fournier, P.A. 2007, &quot;New insights into managing the risk of hypoglycaemia associated with intermittent high-intensity exercise in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus: implications for existing guidelines&quot;, Sports Medicine, vol. 37, no. 11, pp. 937-946&lt;/ref&gt;   

* Avoid exercise if an individual has had low blood glucose &lt;5mmol/l or has recently had a hypoglycemic attack in the prior 24 hours.
* Avoid exercise if an individual has had an intense training session or competition in the prior 24 hours.
* Avoid spontaneous and unplanned exercise, especially if insulin has recently been administered.
* Perform exercise in the morning before insulin administration if able to.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Exercise effects on blood glucose regulation:&lt;ref&gt;Guelfi, K.J., Jones, T.W. &amp; Fournier, P.A. 2007, &quot;New insights into managing the risk of hypoglycaemia associated with intermittent high-intensity exercise in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus: implications for existing guidelines&quot;, Sports Medicine, vol. 37, no. 11, pp. 937-946.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/b&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Intensity !! Duration !! % Vo2max !! Effects on blood glucose !! Example
|-
| Medium || 30min  || 40-60% || Decrease || Running, Cycling
|-
| High || &lt;15min || &gt;80% || Increase || Sprinting
|-
| Team Sports || 30min || 40-60% w/ Short sprint's || Slight Decrease || Rugby, Soccer
|}

=='''Blood Glucose Monitoring'''==
Self monitoring of blood glucose before, during and after exercise is recommended to distinguish when changes in insulin or carbohydrate intake are needed, monitoring of blood glucose can also provide an insight into the response of blood glucose towards various types of physical acivity.&lt;ref&gt;Ertl, A. &amp; Davis, S. 2004, &quot;Evidence for a vicious cycle of exercise and hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, Diabetes/metabolism research and reviews, vol. 20, no. 2, pp. 124-130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Powers, S.K., Howley, E.T. (2009). Exercise Physiology: Theory and applications to fitness and performance 7th edition. Mcgraw-Hill Companies, Inc. New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|Effects of Resistance Training on the Reduction of Sarcopenia}}


== Background ==


=== What is Sarcopenia? ===
Sarcopenia refers to the gradual decline in muscle mass and increase in adipose storage as a result of aging &lt;ref name=&quot;kamel&quot;&gt;Kamel, H. K. (2003). Sarcopenia and Aging. Nutrition Reviews, 61(5 pt 1), 157-67.&lt;/ref&gt;. Not to be confused with atrophy, the degradation of muscle due to inactivity, rather as a result of muscle wastage. It is linked with:

* functional disability 
* falls
* decreased bone density
* glucose intolerance 
* decreased hot and cold tolerance &lt;ref name=&quot;kamel&quot;/&gt;


There are various molecular mediators that are effected by these age related changes including fiber size and strength, mitochondrial homeostasis and apoptosis. Factors that further effect sarcopenia are: 

* physical inactivity
* malnutrition
* oxidative stress
* abnormalities in growth and sex hormones &lt;ref name=&quot;kamel&quot;/&gt;

Between the ages of 50-70 years there is an approximate 30% reduction in muscle strength as a result of sarcopenia. &lt;ref name=&quot;vella&quot;&gt;Vella, C., &amp; Kravitz, L. (n.d.). Sarcopenia: The Mystery of Muscle Loss. Exercise Science at UNM. Retrieved October 24, 2011, from http://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/sarcopenia.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resistance Exercise in Reducing Sarcopenia ==
Evidence has shown that resistance training is the best way to slow or reverse sarcopenia&lt;ref name=&quot;camp&quot;&gt;Campbell, W. W. (2007). Synergistic Use of Higher Protein Diets or Nutritional Supplements With RT to Counter Sarcopenia. Nutrition Reviews, 65(9), 416-22.&lt;/ref&gt;. Resistance training enhances strength, power and mobility function and induces skeletal muscle hypertrophy. In the elderly resistance training also induces the muscle expression of IGF-I, myogenic regulator factors and IL-6 to contribute to muscular hypertrophy by regulating function of satellite cells, which in turn will assist in preventing the onset of sarcopenia.&lt;ref name=&quot;sakuma&quot;&gt;Sakuma, K., &amp; Yamaguchi, A. (2010). Molecular Mechanisms in aging and current strategies to counteract sarcopenia. Current Aging Science, 3(2), 90-101.&lt;/ref&gt; Even just one session of resistance exercise for elders can enhance the synthesis rate of muscle protein. &lt;ref name=&quot;camp&quot;/&gt; 
Resistance training also enhances the nervous system leading to an improved functional capacity during everyday tasks. This is because the loss of muscle mass with aging may be the result of impaired capacity for axonal reinnervation of deinnervated muscle fibers, which would attribute to the enhancement of the nervous system through resistance training.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaa&quot;&gt;Aagaard, P., Suetta, C., Caserotti, P., Magnusson, S. P., &amp; Kjaer, M. (2010). Role of the nervous system in sarcopenia and muscle atrophy with aging: strength training as a countermeasure.. Scandinavian Journal Of Medicine &amp; Science In Sports, 20(1), 49-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recommendations==
Although the following guidelines are best for reducing the effects of sarcopenia, a participant who is involved in any form of resistance training is better then one who doesn't train at all.
* Complete 8-10 exercises involving all the major muscle groups. Multi-joint exercises are recommended.
* Have the participant perform 10-15 repitions of each exercises
* 1 set of each exercise is sufficient for elderly clients
* The intensity of exercise should be 'somewhat hard', roughly 12 or 13 on the Borg's scale
* Resistance training should be performed at least twice a week, with 48 hours between each session &lt;ref name=&quot;vella&quot;/&gt;

In addition, adequate protein and energy intake are key for further management of sarcopenia. &lt;ref&gt;Rolland, Y., Dupuy, C., Abellan van Kan, G., Gillette, S., &amp; Vellas, B. (2011). Treatment Strategies for sarcopenia and frailty. The Medical Clinics of North American, 95(3), 427-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Considerations ===

When determining the amount and frequency of a strength program, attention to overloading the patient needs to be considered as intensive regimes will decrease the effective gain in muscle strength and mass in the elderly. Ensure the program is individualized to the participants needs and current health status. 

Correct technique must be maintained at all times, as the injury risk in the elderly is much greater. Have caution with eccentric training as this creates greater muscle soreness in the elderly. Free weights are excellent tool to use as they not only increase strength but also balance and coordination. &lt;ref name=&quot;vella&quot;/&gt;

== [[SOCIEDAD, FAMILIA Y EDUCACION]] ==

Hello.  Thank you for your recent contributions to English Wikibooks.  Unfortunately your contribution ([[SOCIEDAD, FAMILIA Y EDUCACION]]) may soon be deleted.  This version of Wikibooks is only for books in the English language with the exception of some annotated texts within language books.  I think that your book would be more at home at [http://es.wikibooks.org Spanish Wikibooks].

: I have just seen your message on my talk page.  I added the Speedy Delete tag to the page but I wasn't the person who deleted the page.  Another administrator deleted it and probably didn't notice that it had only very recently been created.  Sorry for any problems this has caused you.  It is night hours here in Italy too and I agree that we were too quick to delete your work.  I have transferred a copy of the original page to your user space: [[User:Enguita/SOCIEDAD, FAMILIA Y EDUCACION]]--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:34, 24 October 2011 (UTC)</text>

{{Closed|1= Conclusion is '''keep'''. Stub with valid content.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 01:38, 22 October 2011 (UTC)}}

Hi please delete [[OpenSolaris]]. Sorry I have been away for so long. OpenSolaris is no longer a valid subject since Oracle took over Sun.  -- tjyang

Also regarding to [[CPAM with TWW]], I think the content fit the Title, it is not a SPAM. It is about using TWW's tool to do application management across OS platforms. TWW's tool is in GNU license, you can use it for free and modified in a GNU license term. The quality of content is another story. Hoping to get more people on board to write this book for free. Looks like not many people are interested about this subject. I won't mind if you delete this for the reason of lack of interest. -- tjyang

The book appears to be abandoned and it appears to be biased towards www.thewrittenword.com bordering on SPAM. --[[User:Fasten|Bernhard Fastenrath]] 09:59, 26 June 2011 (UTC)

:I have no problem with the deletion of [[OpenSolaris]], it is mostly an empty stub and unlike this book project covers a broader subject. In relation to this book project it seems to cover especially the software solution created by The Written Word company and so it is within the scope to point out and reference the company resources in it. We have similar projects of this type and unless the editors prevent people to add other points of views, even negative comments or mention competitive products this doesn't constitute spam and an issue that merits a RfD, considering also that there is a reasonable amount of content on this project...&lt;br&gt;

== What is Insulin Sensitivity? == 
[[File:Insulinresistance.jpg‎‎|left|80px|frame|Comparison of normal insulin response and an insulin resistive response]] When the digestive system breaks down food to produce glucose, it is absorbed into the blood stream and the body’s blood glucose level (BGL) rises. As the BGL rises, the pancreas releases insulin to help the uptake of glucose by the cells to use as energy. In a non-diabetic, normal levels of the hormone insulin are released after a meal to help restore the blood glucose levels to normal as the tissues respond by absorbing glucose, storing it as glycogen. In an insulin resistant person, this process breaks down and the body fails to use the secreted insulin effectively because the cells do not respond adequately to the presence of insulin. . &lt;ref name=&quot;fields&quot;&gt;Field, J. Insulin Resistance in Diabetes. Annual Review of Medicine. 1962; 13; 249-260.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, more insulin is required to reduce the BGL causing the pancreas to work harder to keep up with the demand. Eventually the pancreas cannot keep up with the demands and begins to fail, causing the BGL to rise exponentially.

According to Diabetes Australia, 1.7 million Australians have diabetes, and an estimated 2 million Australians are pre-diabetic. &lt;ref name=&quot;diabetes&quot;&gt;Diabetes Australia, 2008. http://www.diabetesvic.org.au/health-professionals/diabetes-facts, 20/11/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The exact cause of NIDDM is still unknown but it is believed to be caused by both genetic and environmental factors. 
== What is Resistance Exercise Training (RET)? == 
Resistance exercise training involves each effort being performed against an opposing force. It is used to develop strength and size of skeletal muscles and is achieved by progressively overloading the musculoskeletal system so it gets stronger. &lt;ref name=&quot;yaspelkis&quot;&gt;Yaspelkis, B. Resistance Training Improves Insulin Sensitivity and Action in Skeletal Muscles. American College of Sports Medicine. 2006; 34; 1; 42-46.&lt;/ref&gt;
== How does Resistance Exercise improve Insulin Sensitivity? ==
The treatment goal in patients with Type II Diabetes is to achieve and maintain a relatively normal blood glucose level by increasing insulin sensitivity. Resistance exercise training is a therapeutic modality used to achieve this in the following ways:&lt;ref name=&quot;sigal&quot;&gt;Sigal, R, Wasserman D. Physical activity/exercise and type 2 diabetes. Diabetes Care. 2004; 27; 2518-2539.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Body sensitivity to insulin is directly proportional to muscle mass and the decrease in insulin resistance is related to an increase in lean body mass, allowing more glucose to be cleared from the blood. &lt;ref name=&quot;eves&quot;&gt; Eves, N, Plotnikoff, R. Resistance Training and Type 2 Diabetes: Considerations for implementation at the population level. Diabetes Care. 2006; 29; 8; 1933-1941&lt;/ref&gt;
* Changes in the quality of muscles, not just the quantity of muscles improves skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity. A shift from Type IIb muscle fibres to more insulin sensitivity Type IIa muscle fibres decreases insulin resistance. &lt;ref name=”balady”&gt; Balady, G, Tresierras, M. Resistance Training in the Treatment of Diabetes and Obesity: mechanisms and outcomes. Journal of Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation and Prevention. 2009; 29; 67-75.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The results from a variety of studies indicate that changes in insulin sensitivity and the signalling pathway are related to adaptations at a cellular level. These include: an increase in the glucose transporter isoform (GLUT-4), protein kinase B content (a kinase involved in the insulin signalling pathway to glycogen synthase) and glycogen synthase activity. After resistance exercise training, research shows that less insulin is required by the patient to achieve the same lowering effect on blood glucose levels, suggesting that insulin sensitivity will improve. Resistance trained muscles show improvements in their ability to alter components of the insulin signalling pathway in skeletal muscles, having elevated rates of glucose transport and a decrease in insulin resistance. &lt;ref name=&quot;fields&quot;&gt;Field, J. Insulin Resistance in Diabetes. Annual Review of Medicine. 1962; 13; 249-260.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;krisan&quot;&gt;Krisan, A.D., D.E. Collins, A.M. Crain, C.C. Kwong, M.K. Singh, J.R. Bernard, and B.B. Yaspelkis III. Resistance training enhances compo- nents of the insulin signaling cascade in normal and high-fat-fed skeletal muscle. J. Appl. Physiol. 2004; 96:1691–1700.&lt;/ref&gt;
== Recommendations for Resistance Training == 
[[File:Leg press.jpg|thumb|x200px|The leg press is a typical resistance training exercise]]Resistance exercise training can elicit metabolic benefits like improved insulin sensitivity with low to moderate intensity, low volume programs. This is key to engaging sedentary individuals who might be reluctant to participate in strenuous activity. These benefits begin to manifest themselves in a short period of time and these quick results can serve as a motivator to continue training. For the elderly, frail or overweight, resistance training programs are excellent as they provide less risk of sustaining injuries. Prior to beginning a resistance exercise program, diabetic patients should undergo a medical evaluation by their health care professional to ensure that they are safe to participate and that the activities in their programs can be performed correctly to maximize benefits and minimize risk of injury. &lt;ref name=&quot;yaspelkis&quot;&gt;Yaspelkis, B. Resistance Training Improves Insulin Sensitivity and Action in Skeletal Muscles. American College of Sports Medicine. 2006; 34; 1; 42-46.&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''The American College of Sports Medicine recommends that resistance training should be integrated into the exercise programs for adults with Type II Diabetes and the following guidelines should be considered:''' The frequency of exercise should be 2-4 times a week at an intensity of 50-80% of patients VO2 max, sessions should be 30-60 minutes long, 1-2 sets at the beginning of the program but as patient progresses increase to 3-4 and each set should consist of 10-15 repetitions. &lt;ref name=&quot;castaneda&quot;&gt;Castaneda, C., J.E. Layne, L. Munoz-Orians, P.L. Gordon, J. Walsmith, M. Foldvari, R. Roubenoff, K.L. Tucker, and M.E. Nelson. A randomized controlled trial of resistance exercise training to improve glycemic control in older adults with type 2 diabetes. Diabetes Care 2002; 25:2335–2341.&lt;/ref&gt;

Resistance exercise training programs should be progressive and individually designed for each patient. As the patient’s insulin sensitivity improves, modifications to exercise type and intensity should be made. &lt;ref name=&quot;fields&quot;&gt;Field, J. Insulin Resistance in Diabetes. Annual Review of Medicine. 1962; 13; 249-260.&lt;/ref&gt; Modifications can be made for severe cases and high risk patients. Lighter workloads, strategic eating before and during exercise, constant checking of blood glucose levels and knowing the warning signs of hypoglycemia (dizziness, anxiety, shaking) will help with exercise tolerance. &lt;ref name=&quot;yaspelkis&quot;&gt;Yaspelkis, B. Resistance Training Improves Insulin Sensitivity and Action in Skeletal Muscles. American College of Sports Medicine. 2006; 34; 1; 42-46.&lt;/ref&gt; Following basic exercise protocols for proper warm-up and cool-down are also essential, as well as wearing appropriate footwear, maintaining adequate hydration and avoiding exercising in extreme environments. &lt;ref name=&quot;fields&quot;&gt;Field, J. Insulin Resistance in Diabetes. Annual Review of Medicine. 1962; 13; 249-260.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Scotch bonnet peppers (capsicum chinense) are a variety of chili Pepper indigenous to the Americas and in the range of 100,000 to 300,000 on the Scoville scale. They have a distinct flavor from their more common habanero cousin.
[[File:Scotch Bonnet Pepper Poppers.jpg|280px|right]]

==Ingredients==
* 24 Scotch bonnet peppers
* 1 cup whole milk ricotta cheese
* 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
* 1/4 cup minced onion
* 1/4 pound Italian sausage


==Procedure==
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Fry sausage on medium-high heat, chopping as it cooks until it is the size of small peas.
Drain and cool slightly. In a bowl, mix ricotta, Parmesan, and onion with sausage to form the filling. Cut tops of peppers about 1/4 inch below the 
stem. Set tops aside. With a sharp knife, scoop out seeds and membrane from each pepper. Mix as much of the seeds and membrane into the filling as needed to regulate heat.
For example, moderate poppers use seeds and membrane from six to eight peppers. Moderate poppers nicely complement the cocktail hour. For very hot poppers, leave the seeds and membranes in each pepper.
Using your fingers, stuff each pepper with filling. Replace tops. Place poppers on parchment lined tray and bake 15-20 minutes or until desired. 
Cool slightly before serving.


==Warning==
Persons with sensitive skin may need culinary gloves. Take care to protect eyes when handling peppers.

Insulin Resistance (IR) is a condition in which the cells of the body become resistant to the effects of insulin. Thus, a person is said to have impaired glucose tolerance / pre-diabetes. IR results in higher levels of insulin being required to maintain normal blood glucose levels. Eventually, the pancreas may be unable to keep up with insulin demand leading to long term health issues.

*''1 in 4 adults in Australia may at some time in their life have impaired glucose tolerance''

*''Being diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance does not necessarily mean you will develop diabetes, but it makes you 10-20 times more likely than a normal person''

*''It is estimated that up to 1.8 million Australians are living with diabetes / impaired glucose tolerance''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) in Indigenous Australians ==

=== What is GDM? ===

* Elevated fasting glucose levels attained during pregnancy
* Usually diagnosed between 24 and 28 weeks
* According to US data occurrence in 5-9% of pregnancies &lt;ref&gt;Serlin, D., Lash, R., (2009) Diagnosis and Management of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus., American Family Physician., July 1, 2009, volume 80, number 1, pg 57-62.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Women who have GDM generally do not experience any symptoms, but they may experience the following: tiredness, excessive thirst, frequent urination or blurred vision &lt;ref&gt;Gestational Diabetes. (2011). BabyCenter Australia Medical Advisory Board. Viewed Monday 17th October.,  http://www.babycenter.com.au/pregnancy/complications/diabetes/&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Risk factors for developing GDM ===


* Glycosuria (glucose present in the urine; usually caused by excess carbohydrate intake or the kidney tubules' inability to reabsorb.)
* Diabetes in a first degree relative
* Aged over 30 years
* A history of glucose intolerance
* Marked obesity or BMI (Body Mass Index) greater than 25
* A previous infant with macrosomia (enlarged birthweight)
* Ethnicity (Aboriginal, Hispanic, South Asian, Asian or African Desert descent)
&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, L., Nolan, C., Wilson, J.D., Oats, J.N. and Simmons, D. (1998). Gestational diabetes mellitus -- management guidelines. The Medical Journal of Australia. 169: 93-97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Preventing Type 2 Diabetes in Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Communities in NSW -Diabetes Prevention Research Report Series. (2007). University of Sydney. Viewed Monday 17th October., http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/pubs/2007/pdf/diabetes.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;[1]

=== Indigenous at Risk ===

It is important to specifically target these populations as the Aboriginal community is 20% more likely to be diagnosed with GDM. [3]

This may be due to individual factors such as[4]&lt;ref&gt;DiabetesWA, Don’t ignore Diabetes., Diabetes WA - ABN: 77 867 587 369., viewed Tuesday 18th October., http://www.dontignorediabetes.com.au/Aboriginal_People_and_Diabetes&lt;/ref&gt;:

* Poor diet; consuming energy dense foods
* Increase in sedentary behaviours
* Higher number of indigenous smokers
* Obesity; 57% of Australian Aboriginals are classed as overweight or obese in 15 years and up.[5]
* High rates of alcohol consumption

Or community factors such as[4]: 

* Impact of historical and political events
* Low socio-economical status
* Decrease of health service due to rural setting or cultural beliefs
* Increase in daily stress

Research has shown that many indigenous Australians view diabetes as a low priority and subsequently act too late in prevention and management of the disease.
Approximately 50% of women with GDM will develop Type II diabetes within 5-10 years[1]. Particularly in Indigenous women the impact of prevention and optimal treatment is an important area of focus for them and their offspring's health. 

To minimize the risk of contracting Type II diabetes women should&lt;ref&gt;Kim, C., Newton, K., Knopp, R., (2002) Gestational Diabetes and the Incidence of Type 2 Diabetes: A systematic review., Care October 2002 vol. 25 no. 10 1862-1868., doi: 10.2337/diacare.25.10.1862Diabetes&lt;/ref&gt;:

* Breastfeed
* Exercise for 150min per week at a moderate intensity
* Maintain a healthy diet before, during and post pregnancy

=== Physical Activity and GDM ===

Physical activity greatly increases the body's sensitivity to insulin and the insulin in use will last for longer.
This has great effects on reducing the blood glucose levels in the body and decreases the need for pharmacological interventions such as insulin injections.[2]&lt;ref&gt;Mottola, M., (2007) The Role of Exercise in the Prevention and Treatment of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus., Current Sports Medicine Reports (American College of Sports Medicine) Dec2007, Vol. 6 Issue 6, p381 6p.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a person is physically active pre-pregnancy the chance of developing GDM is greatly reduced. Indigenous women are more prone to sedentary behaviour. To increase exercise initiation and adherence, women should consult their health care professionals on their exercise beliefs. That is: advantages, social influences, and perceived barriers to exercise, as a framework for designing effective GDM treatment and prevention programs.[4]

=== Physical Activity Guidelines ===

In the Aboriginal community, due to urbanisation and a shift from the hunter-gatherer lifestyle to a more westernised lifestyle, there has been a reduction in physical activity.  Physical activity, as mentioned also has social and community connotations for Aboriginal people; the social aspect of physical activity is an important factor in working out interventions aimed at increasing exercise.  Thus, a program that is aimed at early detection and primary intervention with a better understanding of indigenous culture can have a better therapeutic outcome than one usually designed for the general population. [3][4]

There are currently limited exercise guidelines that specifically target the Indigenous women. It is important to target this population so that Indigenous Australians may be appropriately educated on what resources are potentially available.
The frequency, type, duration and intensity of the exercise program should be tailored to each individual’s needs. 

General guidelines are:

* 30 minutes of brisk organised activity a day[3][6][7]
10 minutes of arm exercises after every meal has also been shown to decrease blood glucose levels along with the implementation of a resistance program; resistance exercise training may help to avoid insulin therapy for overweight women with gestational diabetes.&lt;ref&gt; Brankston, G.N., Ryan, E.A. &amp; Okun, N.B. (2004).  Resistance exercise training may help to avoid insulin therapy for overweight women with gestational diabetes mellitus. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynocology. 190 (1):188-193&lt;/ref&gt;[7]
Exercise intervention along with diet modification has a much greater effect on the prevention and treatment of GDM than diet alone. [7]

=== Diet ===

A large proportion of the Aboriginal community consumes energy dense food and do not have easy access to fresh fruits and vegetables. This problem is worse for isolated or rural communities due to lack of grocery stores selling fresh fruits and vegetables and being able to afford the high cost of fresh food. 

Several studies have found links between the dietary intake of Aboriginal people and diabetes and this risk is reduced with the consumption of bush meats, reduction of processed meat consumption and removing the fat from meat before cooking.[3][4]

[[File:Universe_expansion2.png|thumb|300px|left|According to the Big Bang model, the universe expanded from an extremely dense and hot state and continues to expand today. A common analogy explains that space itself is expanding, carrying galaxies with it, like spots on an inflating balloon. The graphic scheme above is an artist's concept illustrating the expansion of a portion of a flat universe.]]'''Big Bang''', a great explosion that happened around 13.75 ± 0.11 &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/dr4/pub_papers/sevenyear/basic_results/wmap_7yr_basic_results.pdf], Seven-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP1) Observations: Sky Maps, Systematic Errors, and Basic Results, '''page39'''.&lt;/ref&gt; billion years ago , is thought to create our universe. The idea is based on the observation that our universe is expanding, so it was probably a single point at some time in the past if we trace back.

At about 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the explosion, quarks and gluons combined to form baryons such as '''protons''' and '''neutrons''', while anti-quarks and anti-gluons formed anti-protons and anti-neutrons. A small excess of quarks and gluons over their anti-particles led to a small excess of baryons over anti-baryons. Latter, the universe cooled to a level that it could not produce gluons, quarks, anti-gluons and anti-quarks. This led to a dramatic decrease in the universe mass: matter and anti-matter 'eats' each other, left only 1 of 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; protons and neutrons survive and none of their anti-particles. That's why the universe now is a matter environment, not an anti-matter one :)

At one second afther the explosion, same thing happened to '''electrons''' and positrons (positrons are anti-electrons)

A few minutes after the explosion, the temperature was about 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; K. The energy was still so high. Protons and neutrons didn't combine yet. When the universe got cooler, the '''strong force''' (a powerful but short-range force) got advantage, combined protons and neutrons together, formed '''nuclei'''. After 379,000 years, '''electromagnetic force''' (a weak but long-range force) got advantage, making electrons first attached to nuclei. The first atom was born, consisting of a nuclei (protons, neutrons) and one or more electrons.

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

These conventions are aimed to increase the readability and the comprehension of the Java Programming Wikibook. It completes the [[Wikibooks:MOS|Wikibooks Manual of Style]]. However exceptions can be made if needed. If you find it too complex to follow, add the content rawly. It will be formatted by someone.

== Page formatting ==
Most of the time a page from the Java Programming Wikibook has a structure that looks like this:

{|style=&quot;text-align: left; width:100%&quot;
|style=&quot;border-right:1px solid grey; text-align:center;&quot;|You write
|style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|You get
|-
|style=&quot;border-right:1px solid grey&quot;|&lt;pre&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Displaytitle|title=The title of the page}}
{{Java Programming/Navigation|previous=Previous page|next=Next page}}
{{Java Programming/LanguageFundamentalsTopic/Nav}}
__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

This is the introduction.

==First section==

This is a section.

&lt;noinclude&gt;
{{Java Programming/Navigation|previous=Previous page|next=Next page}}
{{Status|50%}}
{{BookCat}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
||&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Java Programming/Navigation|previous=Previous page|next=Next page}}
{{Java Programming/LanguageFundamentalsTopic/Nav}}
__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

This is the introduction.

==First section==

This is a section.

&lt;noinclude&gt;
{{Java Programming/Navigation|previous=Previous page|next=Next page}}
{{BookCat}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
|}

==Samples==

===Java file===
Sometimes we wish to convey an entire java file, this can be done as follows:

{|style=&quot;text-align: left; width:100%&quot;
|style=&quot;border-right:1px solid grey; text-align:center;&quot;|You write
|style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|You get
|-
|style=&quot;border-right:1px solid grey&quot;|&lt;pre&gt;{{XCode|1='''Code listing 1.1: The &lt;code&gt;MyClass&lt;/code&gt; class'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
class MyClass{}
&lt;/source&gt;}}&lt;/pre&gt;
||{{XCode|1='''Code listing 1.1: The &lt;code&gt;MyClass&lt;/code&gt; class'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
class MyClass{}
&lt;/source&gt;}}
|}

&quot;1.1&quot; means that it is the first code of the first chapter. Using &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is better than using a template as &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; is a part of the Java syntax.

===Snippets===
When just a small section of code is shown, the code template may be used as follows:

{|style=&quot;text-align: left; width:100%&quot;
|style=&quot;border-right:1px solid grey; text-align:center;&quot;|You write
|style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|You get
|-
|style=&quot;border-right:1px solid grey&quot;|&lt;pre&gt;{{XExample|1='''Code section 1.1: The &lt;code&gt;MyClass&lt;/code&gt; class'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
for (int i=0; i&lt;10; i++) {
    System.out.println(&quot;Hello!&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}&lt;/pre&gt;
||{{XExample|1='''Code section 1.1: The &lt;code&gt;MyClass&lt;/code&gt; class'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
for (int i=0; i&lt;10; i++) {
    System.out.println(&quot;Hello!&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}
|}

===Screen print===
To represent what is shown on the screen, use the following syntax:

{|style=&quot;text-align: left; width:100%&quot;
|style=&quot;border-right:1px solid grey; text-align:center;&quot;|You write
|style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|You get
|-
|style=&quot;border-right:1px solid grey&quot;|&lt;pre&gt;{{XCode|1='''Output for the application'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
Hello World!
&lt;/pre&gt;
||{{XCode|1='''Output for the application'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
Hello World!
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

==Notes==
Notes grant readers additional information about a certain topic. You can enter additional or side notes by using the following template:
{|style=&quot;text-align: left; width:100%&quot;
|style=&quot;border-right:1px solid grey; text-align:center;&quot;|You write
|style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|You get
|-
|style=&quot;border-right:1px solid grey&quot;|&lt;pre&gt;{{XNote|This is an additional note.}}&lt;/pre&gt;
||{{XNote|This is an additional note.}}
|}

Use notes only when it is necessary. A note is less readable than paragraphs.

==Warning==
To warn the user of things like common pitfalls, the &lt;code&gt;XWarning&lt;/code&gt; template should be used as demonstrated:
{|style=&quot;text-align: left; width:100%&quot;
|style=&quot;border-right:1px solid grey; text-align:center;&quot;|You write
|style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|You get
|-
|style=&quot;border-right:1px solid grey&quot;|&lt;pre&gt;{{XWarning|This is a warning.}}&lt;/pre&gt;
||{{XWarning|This is a warning.}}
|}

==To-do items==
If there are sections of the book that require attention at a later time, you can add a to-do note by including the following template:

{|style=&quot;text-align: left; width:100%&quot;
|style=&quot;border-right:1px solid grey; text-align:center;&quot;|You write
|style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|You get
|-
|style=&quot;border-right:1px solid grey&quot;|&lt;pre&gt;{{TODO|To-do items for pages should be kept in their respective comment boxes.|Java Programming}}&lt;/pre&gt;
||{{TODO|To-do items for pages should be kept in their respective comment boxes.|Java Programming}}
|}

== Hidden section ==
If a section is optional, it can be hidden like this:

{|style=&quot;text-align: left; width:100%&quot;
|style=&quot;border-right:1px solid grey; text-align:center;&quot;|You write
|style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|You get
|-
|style=&quot;border-right:1px solid grey&quot;|&lt;pre&gt;{{Java/Hidden begin|title=Hidden section}}
This section is not mandatory.
{{Hidden end}}&lt;/pre&gt;
||{{Java/Hidden begin|title=Hidden section}}
This section is not mandatory.
{{Hidden end}}
|}

==Illustrations and diagrams==
This book uses various illustrations and diagrams to convey its message, e.g., flow-chart or UML diagrams, etc. Due to the nature of diagrams, they need to designed with a scalable vector format. It is highly recommended that you use the SVG format for your diagrams. Please, do ''not'' use JPG or PNG for diagrams that could otherwise be done in SVG. Ask a regular contributor for his/her help in this matter.

A regular feature for diagrams used in this book is the overall color scheme. The most notable color used for illustrations in this book is &lt;span style=&quot;display: inline-block; background-color: #2a7fff; width: 16px; height: 16px; border: solid 1px #0a5fdf;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code style=&quot;color:#2a7fff;width:20px;&quot;&gt;#2a7fff&lt;/code&gt; (''as is shown for the diagrams below, for instance''). In order to include illustrations into your content, you need to use the &lt;code&gt;{{[[Template:Java/Illustration|Java/Illustration]]}}&lt;/code&gt; template. Given below is an example of how this template ought to be used.

{|style=&quot;text-align: left; width:100%&quot;
|style=&quot;border-right:1px solid grey; text-align:center;&quot;|You write
|style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|You get
|-
|style=&quot;border-right:1px solid grey&quot;|&lt;pre&gt;{{Java/Illustration
|number=1
|caption=A sample illustration from the book
|image=[[File:Java Compilation Basics.svg|center]]
}}&lt;/pre&gt;
||{{Java/Illustration
|number=1
|caption=A sample illustration from the book
|image=[[File:Java Compilation Basics.svg|center]]
}}
|}

== Text formatting ==
* Use italic when you use a term for the first time.
* Use the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;code/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup when use refer to a class, a field or a method.

==Preferred English==
This book uses United States English, purely for the sake of consistency. Most programming languages have words represented in the United States English, e.g., &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt;, etc. You should use the US English wherever possible.

== Code conventions ==
The book follows the [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/codeconvtoc-136057.html official Java code conventions]. Here is an example:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 0.1: The official Java code conventions'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
if (foo == bar) {
    // do stuff
} else {
    // do other stuff
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Background of Exercise and Depression==
Depression is a common and debilitating mental disease that can have a devastating effect on the individual and those close to them. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood) Depression] is characterized by prolonged feelings of sadness, dejection and hopelessness.

The World Health Organisation International Classification of Disease classifies depression as:
* 2 weeks of abnormal depressed mood
* Loss of interest and decreased energy
* Loss of confidence
* Excessive guilt
* Recurrent thoughts of death
* Poor concentration
* Sleep disturbance
* Change in appetite.&lt;ref name=”Dnet”&gt; DepressioNet.org.au (2011). &quot;What is Depression&quot;. http://depressionet.org.au/what-is-depression/ ?open&lt;/ref&gt;

Two symptoms of depression are quite recognizable, lack of motivation and fatigue resulting in exercise not being a priority. Depressed patients are often physically sedentary. Which can cause a reduction in  physical work capacity. This indicates that the reduced fitness level is caused by physical inactivity and is a strong argument for integrating physical fitness training into comprehensive treatment programmes for depression. &lt;ref name= “Martinsen”&gt; Benefits of exercise for the treatment of depression (1990). “Sports Med”.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2192427?open&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exercise effects on Depression==
Regular exercise can be an effective treatment by itself for mild depression (particularly for people who were previously sedentary). For more severe depression, exercise can be a helpful addition alongside other treatments (e.g. medication or psychological therapies).&lt;ref name= “BDI”&gt; Exercise and Depression (2011). “Black Dog Institute Australia”. http://www.blackdoginstitute.org.au/docs/ExerciseandDepression.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Benefits of regular exercise may help depression by improving:
* Self-esteem and confidence 
* Energy levels
* Social aspects (especially in group exercise situations)
* Sleeping patterns 
* Distraction from areas of worry, concern and guilt 
* increased levels of brain neurotransmitter serotonin &lt;ref name= “BDI”&gt; Exercise and Depression (2011). “Black Dog Institute Australia”. http://www.blackdoginstitute.org.au/docs/ExerciseandDepression.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exercise Recommendations==
When designing an exercise prescription for patients who have depression the individual circumstances of each patient must be considered. Hopelessness and fatigue can make exercise difficult, and some individuals are vmay feel guilt and self-blame if they fail to stick with a regimen.  A realistic, flexible, and pleasurable program has the best chance for success.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| '''Frequency'''|| 2-5 times a week
|-
| '''Intensity''' || Whatever the individual feels up to
|-
| '''Time''' || 30+ minutes a day overall
|-
| '''Type''' || Aerobic or resistance
|}

The National Physical Activity Guidelines for Australians recommend:
* A minimum of 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise on most, preferably all, days of the week (an example of ‘moderate intensity’ exercise is brisk walking where you notice a slight increase in breathing and heart rate)
* Exercising for at least 10 minutes at a time - the 30-minutes total does not need to be continuous -you can combine short sessions of different activities to a total of 30 minutes or more each day.
* Being active in as many ways you can each day (e.g. use the stairs).
* Both aerobic exercise (e.g. brisk walking, cycling or jogging) and resistance or strength training (e.g. weight-lifting) have been found to be beneficial for depression.&lt;ref name= “BDI”&gt; Exercise and Depression (2011). “Black Dog Institute Australia”. http://www.blackdoginstitute.org.au/docs/ExerciseandDepression.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* http://www.lifeline.org.au/ Or Call 13 11 14

==Research Based Evidence==
Numerous studies have shown that people who exercise regularly experience fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety than those who do not exercise regularly.
* Several trials have shown that regular exercise of moderate intensity can be an effective treatment by itself for mild to moderate depression.
* Two trials have found that 16 weeks of regular exercise is equally effective as an SSRI antidepressant medication in the treatment of mild to moderate depression in older adults who have been inactive.
* Research also suggests that exercise can further assist depression in individuals with depression who have responded only partially to an antidepressant medication.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Albert Claude (August 23, 1899 - May 22, 1983), who was a Belgium biochemist who specialized in the structure and function of cells was born in Longlier, Belgium and is most well known for winning the Nobel Peace Prize in Physiology and Medicine 1974 with Christian de Duve and George Emil Palade &quot;for their discoveries concerning the structural and functional organization of the cell.&quot; Albert Claude made giant strides for cell biology in his studies of the cell structure. 

Claude was born and buried in Belgium but was also a U.S. citizen. He served in World War I with British Intelligence and later received the Inter-Allied Medal for his contributions and was admitted into the University of Liege through a program for war veterans. 

After receiving his medical degree in 1928, he joined the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York in 1929 and became an American citizen.  In 1930 Claude discovered the process of cell fractionation. This was groundbreaking at the time because prior to Claude's research, it was thought that the inside of cells were composed of a chaotic mass of substances with no order or particular function. However, with his discovery, Claude was able to show that cell interiors are in fact very well-organized. To discover cell fractionation, Claude used mechanisms from everyday machinery. He combined the mechanism from meat grinders and a sieve to construct a simple, high-speed centrifuge which led the way for ultracentrifugation, a technique for breaking and spinning infected cells to isolate their agents according to mass. He discovered that particular fractions of the cells correlated to particular cell functions. Claude discovered the endoplasmic reticulum, which is a membranous network within a cell. The rough endoplasmic reticulum, which has ribosomes attached to the surface, synthesizes proteins. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum synthesizes lipids and steroids, metabolizes carbohydrates and steroids (but not lipids), and regulates calcium concentration, drug metabolism, and attachment of receptors on cell membrane proteins. Claude is also coined as one of the first scientists to have used an electronic microscope for his cellular structure studies.

In 1948, he returned to Belgium where he was the dictator of the Jules Bordet Research Institute.  He then went on to retire in 1972.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is Diabetes? ==
Diabetes is a group of metabolic disorders characterised by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both from the pancreas. Type 2 is caused by the body's ineffective use of insulin. It is associated with obesity and physical inactivity.

== What is the HbA1c? ==
In the blood stream are red blood cells which are haemoglobin molecules. The glucose sticks to these molecules to form a 'glycosylated haemoglobin' molecule which is the HbA1c. The more glucose in the blood the more HbA1c. 
Strict control of the hyperglycemia is an essential part of the management of diabetes in order to prevent chronic progression of the complications. &lt;br/&gt;
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxnePlhjpRs&amp;feature=related Diabetes Test : HbA1c explanation.]

== Resistance Training : A Definition ==
Resistance training involves using weights such as a dumbbell, barbell or other type of resistance as a force working against the muscles to increase muscular strength.&lt;br/&gt;
This type of training has many benefits as shown below &lt;br/&gt;

== What are the benefits of Resistance training for the HbA1c ?==
There are many benefits of using Resistance training on the HbA1c of people with Type II Diabetes. &lt;br/&gt;
The 'Lift for Life' program based on research conducted by Baker IDI which showed that using strength training, there were changes in blood glucose control which matched and sometimes exceeded that which is normally produced by the traditional drug solutions, is one such program that shows benefits. 
&lt;br&gt;
Other benefits of Resistance Training for diabetic patients include increased muscle size and strength which are shown to increase functionality and insulin sensitivity.

== Recommendations for training programs ==
The individual should involve a range of exercises from 6-9, with a focus on the major muscle groups (leg,chest,shoulders,back,arms and abdomen)
The style of exercise should be similar to that used by an athlete for muscular endurance where the aim is to gain improvements in muscle mass and not necessarily strength. 

Style of Resistance Training for Type 2 diabetics

=== Diabetes===
Diabetes is one the most common chronic disease affecting million of people worldwide&lt;ref name=”Leslie”&gt; Leslie, R., &amp; Robbins, D. (1995). Diabetes: Clinical Science in Practice, Cambridge University, United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt;.The human body cells resistance to insulin or the inability to take up glucose efficiently causes diabetes&lt;ref name=”Woodruff”&gt; Woodruff, S., &amp; Saudek, C. (2005), The complete diabetes prevention plan: A guide to understanding the emerging epidemic of pre-diabetes and halting its progression to diabetes, Penguin Press, United States.&lt;/ref&gt;.There are two types of diabetes – Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune disease&lt;ref name=”Ganz”&gt;Ganz, M. (2005). Prevention of type 2 diabetes, John Wiley &amp; Sons, United States.&lt;/ref&gt;and is common for people under the age of 40 but may occur at any age. This condition causes insulin dependence as the T cells of immune system attack and the disable the pancreas’s beta cells that produce insulin to help convert food into fuel&lt;ref name=”McCarthy”&gt; McCarthy, M. (2007). Everything Parent’s Guide to Children with Juvenile Diabetes: Reassuring Advice for Managing Symptoms and Raising a Healthy Happy Child, Everything Books, United States.&lt;/ref&gt;.In contrast, Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous disease and commonly caused by lack of insulin&lt;ref name=”Levene”&gt; Levene, S. (2003). Managing type 2 diabetes mellitus in primary care: A practical guide, Elsevier Health Sciences, United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Type 1 diabetes is the result of destruction of the beta cells in the pancreas&lt;ref name=” Maahs”&gt; Maahs, D., Taplin, C E., &amp; Fiallo-Scharer, R. (2009). Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Exercise, Humana Press, United States.&lt;/ref&gt;,which is often caused by confused body’s defence mechanism or immune system attacking the cells thought to be invaders&lt;ref name=”Taylor”&gt;Taylor R, (2006), Handbook of Retinal Screening in Diabetes, John Wiley &amp; Sons, United States.&lt;/ref&gt; the need for daily insulin injections to control blood glucose concentrations. The amount of insulin can be lowered with exercise because exercise acts very much like insulin. People with Type 1 diabetes have a higher glucose levels ranging from 300 to 400 mg/dll (16.6 to 22.2 mmol/L)&lt;ref name=”Rubin”&gt; Rubin A, (2011), Diabetes, John Wiley &amp; Sons, United States.&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Exercise === 
[[File:Filled Syringe icon.svg|150px|right]]
The benefits of exercise for those with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus include&lt;ref name=”Olefsky”&gt; Olefsky, J. (2004). Diabetes mellitus: A fundamental and clinical text, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt;:
 
* Lower blood glucose concentration during and after exercise
* Improved insulin sensitivity and decreased insulin requirement
* Improve lipid profile such as decreased triglycerides, decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and increased high-density lipoprotein 2 cholesterol.
* There are also improvement in mild to moderate hypertension and increased energy expenditure resulting to adjunct diet for weight reduction, increased fat loos, and preservation of lead body mass.
* People with Type 1 diabetes doing moderate to heavy exercise may benefit from cardiovascular condition, increased strength and flexibility, and improved sense of well-being and enhanced quality of life.

== Heavy Exercise and Diabetes ==
Heavy exercise is basically defined as when a person's heart rate is severely increased and causes the body to take rapid breaths such as sprinting, power lifting, resistance training and weight training&lt;ref name=”Riddell”&gt; Riddell, M., &amp; Perkins, B. (2004). Type 1 Diabetes and Vigorous Exercise: Applications of Exercise Physiology to Patient Management, Canadian Journal of Diabetes, 30(1), 63-71.&lt;/ref&gt;. Exercise is an essential component of diabetes care and the benefits include possible improvement in blood glucose control for those with Type 2 diabetes. However, exercise is not considered a component of treatment for lowering blood glucose in Type 1 diabetes since it may affect the blood glucose level, which should be approximately 250 mg/dl to be safe.A 5 to 10 minutes exercise can result to 7 to 20 times glucose uptake from the blood thus beneficial to patients with Type 2 diabetes provided their insulin is enough&lt;ref name=”Gavin”&gt; Gavin, III R. (1988). Diabetes and Exercise, American Journal of Nursing, 178-180. &lt;/ref&gt;.

However, low-level insulin patients or those that are insulin-dependent with Type 1 diabetes may become more ketotic and extremely hyperglycaemic with heavy exercise due to rising blood sugar. This is because glucose regulation is particularly important for people with diabetes Type 1 because the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to control glucose in the blood. Therefore, acute rise in blood glucose during heavy exercise can lead to complication such as hypoglycaemia&lt;ref name=”Regensteiner”&gt; Regensteiner, J., Reusch, J., Stewart., K., &amp; Veves A. (2009). Diabetes and Exercise, Humana Press, United States.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Exercise results to life threatening hypoglycaemia, hyperglycemia, and ketoacidosis&lt;ref name=”Perkins”&gt; Perkins, B., &amp; Riddell, M. (2006). Type 1 Diabetes and Exercise: Using the Insulin Pump to Maximum Advantage, Canadian Journal of Diabetes, 30(1), 72-79.&lt;/ref&gt;;&lt;ref name=” Maahs”&gt; Maahs, D., Taplin, C E., &amp; Fiallo-Scharer, R. (2009). Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Exercise, Humana Press, United States. &lt;/ref&gt;.These complications can also lead to hyperglycemia and ketoacid production when people with Type 1 do excessive or heavy exercise. It is therefore necessary that people with Type 1 diabetes regulate their physical activity and exercise in controlled manner otherwise they may suffer from&lt;ref name=”Olefsky”&gt; Olefsky, J. (2004). Diabetes mellitus: A fundamental and clinical text, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt;:
* Exercise-induced and late-onset post exercise hypoglycaemia [[File:Leg press.jpg|200px|right]]
* Hyperglycemia after a heavy exercise
* Hyperglycemia and ketosis in insulin-deficient people
* Cardiovascular diseases such as angina pectoris, myocardial infraction, arrhythmias, and sudden death
* They may also suffer from worsening of long-term complications of diabetes such as increase proteinuria, retinal detachment, soft tissue and joint injuries.
Exercise for people with Type 1 diabetes should be precise and these include the type, mode, intensity, duration, and frequency of the exercise &lt;ref name=”Gavin”&gt; .Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Exercise, Humana Press, United States. &lt;/ref&gt;. These individual should plan with their exercise to avoid hypoglycaemiasuch. According to Sport Medicine Australia (2011), such complication can be avoided by absorbing high glycaemic index carbohydrate if low blood glucose is detected during exercise &lt;ref&gt;Sport Medicine Australia Sport Medicine Australia. (2011). Diabetes and Exercise Fact Sheet, SMA, Australia&lt;/ref&gt;. Perkins &amp; Riddell (2006)and Regensteiner et al(2009) suggested the use of insulin pump therapy for those people who are likely to exert more like athletes. The purpose is to regulate insulin delivery to prevent exercise induced hypoglycaemia, hyperglycemia, and ketosis. These include warm-up regimen, hydration, and measurement of capillary.

== Recommendations ==
People with Type 1 diabetes exercising may need to adjust their dose of insulin based on the pattern of blood glucose levels &lt;ref name= “DeWitt”&gt; DeWitt, D.,&amp; Hisch, I. (2003). Outpatient Insulin Therapy in Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Journal of the American Medical Association, 289(17), 2254-2261.&lt;/ref&gt;.
* Their exercise should be tailored with their goals and medical condition. They must become proficient and committed in self-monitoring, and be sensitive with the intensity and duration of their exercise according to their condition or blood glucose level&lt;ref name=”Frontera”&gt; Frontera, W., Slovik, D., &amp; Dawson, D. (2006). Exercise in rehabilitation medicine, Human Kinetics, United States.&lt;/ref&gt;.For instance, heavy exercise may require decreases of 30% to 50% for rapid-acting insulin and 20% to 35&lt;ref name=”Joslin”&gt; Joslin, E., &amp; Kahn, C. (2005). Joslin’s diabetes mellitus, Lippicott Williams &amp; Wilkins, United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt;.
* Constant insulin infusions normalized or moderate glycemia before and after a heavy exercise. For instance, post-exercise administration of insulin increases MCR or metabolic glucose clearance&lt;ref name=”Porte”&gt; Porte, D., Sherwin, R., Baron, A., Ellenberg, M., &amp; Rifkin H. (2003). Ellenberg and Rifkin’s diabetes mellitus, McGraw-Hill Professional, United States.&lt;/ref&gt;.
* Type I diabetics should exercise a minimum of four to five times per week at a low-to-moderate intensity, for about 30 to 40 minutes.
* It is important for type I diabetics to engage in strength training and flexibility exercises as well. 
* Monitor blood glucose before, during, and after physical activity, and consume food during extensive exercise to avoid hypoglycaemia.
* For preparation for exercise include proper warm-up and cool-down periods and adequate hydration. 
* Wearing an ID bracelet indicating one’s diabetic condition is important. Because type I diabetics are at risk for low glucose levels.

=== Exercise as a treatment for depression === 

''(A Factsheet for Health Professionals)''

BACKGROUND

Depression is a leading cause of disability adjusted life years in Australian adults. http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/pubs/2010/pdf/chorep_summary_2010.pdf
http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/1370.0~2010~Chapter~Burden%20of%20disease%20(4.1.6.4)

There are many different interventions available to treat depression. They are often used in a combination to alleviate or manage depression levels. Some interventions include pharmacotherapy, counseling, exercise, relaxation and lifestyle modifications.  Research has shown that individuals, whom participate in moderate intensity aerobic exercise frequently, are less likely to have severe depression (Missing reference) and that frequent aerobic exercise sessions can be as equally effective as pharmacotherapy in decreasing depression levels (Blumenthal, 2007).   

AEROBIC EXERCISE as a treatment for mental health

Type: Aerobic exercise. 
Examples:
•	Cycling
•	Swimming
•	Jogging
•	Dancing
•	Walking 

Intensity and Duration of Exercise Session: 
Heart rate (HR) kept between 60 – 80% of maxHR for at least 30 minutes of the session. 

Age-Predicted Max HR can be worked out by the following equation:
220 – Age = Age-predicted maxHR

Frequency: 
Psychological benefits are reported from three to five exercise sessions per week. Interventions using five aerobic exercise sessions per week have shown the greatest improvement in depression scores. (Legrand and Heuze, 2007)

Exercise Setting  - At Home, At the Gym, Exercising alone, Group fitness classes.

There is currently inconclusive evidence as to the benefits of exercise setting on depression scores. Research has not shown significant differences between exercising in a group or individual setting (Legrand and Heuze, 2007), or between exercising at home or in a supervised setting i.e. at gym (Blumenthal, 2007).  Varying exercise settings to suit patients is advised to enhance participant participation. 

Important considerations

Decreased participation rates may be observed in depressed individuals due to symptoms of their disease. Some common symptoms of depression include: 

•	Fatigue
•	Lack of energy
•	Hopelessness
•	Psychomotor retardation

It is important to assist individuals and monitor their depression levels throughout exercise programmes to make sure the workload is manageable and helpful in managing the client’s mental illness.

Monitoring fitness gains and exercise performance may provide positive feedback and encourage further participation. (Meyer &amp; Broocks, 2000).

== BACKGROUND ==

Physical activity and exercise is a considerable contributing factor to combating a wide range of lifestyle-related disease states. Currently, exercise has shown much promise in the prevention and treatment of mental health disorders.

Depression is a leading cause of disability adjusted life years in Australian adults&lt;ref name=&quot;NSWHEALTH&quot;&gt;NSW Department of Health (2010) The Health of the People of New South Wales: Summary Report. Accessed on: 20 October 2011 from: http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/pubs/2010/pdf/chorep_summary_2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ABS&quot;&gt; Austrlaian Bureau of Statistics (2010) Health: Burden of Disease. Accessed on: 20 October 2011 from: http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/1370.0~2010~Chapter~Burden%20of%20disease%20(4.1.6.4)&lt;/ref&gt;. There are many different interventions available to treat depression, most involve a combination or treatments to alleviate or manage depression levels. These interventions may include pharmacotherapy, counseling, exercise, relaxation and lifestyle modifications.  Research has shown that individuals, who participate in moderate intensity aerobic exercise frequently are less likely to have severe depression&lt;ref name=”MISSING”&gt;Taliaferro LA, Rienzo BA, Pigg MR, Miller DM, Dodd, VJ.(2009) Associations Between Physical Activity and Reduced Rates of Hopelessness, Depression, and Suicidal Behavior Among College Students. Journal of American College Health. Vol. 57(4) pp. 427-436&lt;/ref&gt;. Frequent aerobic exercise sessions has also be found to be equally as effective in decreasing depression as some pharmacotherapy treatments &lt;ref name=&quot;BLU&quot;&gt;Blumental JA, Babyak MA, Doraiswamy MP, Watkins L, Hoffman B.M., Barbour KA, Herman, Craighead WE, Brosse AL, Waugh R, Hinderlitter A, Sherwood A (2007) Exercise and Pharmacotherapy in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder. Psychosomatic Medicine. Vol.69 Pp. 587-596&lt;/ref&gt;. So as an exercise professional, you can play a large role in the treatment of clients by creating a suitable exercise program.
&lt;br /&gt;

== HOW IT WORKS? ==
There are many mechanisms that are thought to be responsible for the decrease in levels of depression associated with exercise. The most common of these are: -

* '''Self efficacy'''-The confidence that someone feels to complete a task to a particular level&lt;ref name=&quot;LL&quot;&gt; Craft LL (2005)Exercise and clinical depression: examining two psychological mechanisms. Psychology of Sport and Exercise Vol. 6 pp. 151–171. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AD&quot;&gt;Daley A (2008) Exercise and Depression: A Review of Reviews. J Clin Psychol Med Settings. Vol.15 pp.140–147&lt;/ref&gt;.

* '''Distraction Theory'''- It is thought that exercise provides a distraction from depressive thoughts, feeling, anxieties&lt;ref name=&quot;LL&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AD&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

* '''Endorphin Hypothesis'''- The increase levels of endorphins associated with exercise can be responsible for the 'euphoric' feeling&lt;ref name=&quot;ADrev&quot;&gt; Daley A  (2002) Exercise therapy and mental health in clinical populations: is exercise therapy a worthwhile intervention? Advances in Psychiatric TreatmentD Vol. 8, pp. 262–270 &lt;/ref&gt;.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt;Indirect method: Age-predicted maximum heart rate equation&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;Interventions using five aerobic exercise sessions per week have shown the greatest improvement in depression scores.&lt;ref name=&quot;L&amp;H&quot;&gt;Legrand F, Heuze JP (2007) Antidepressant Effects Associated with Different Exercise Conditions in Participants with Depression: A Pilot Study. Journal of Sport and Exercise Physiology. Vol. 29 Pp. 348-364 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

It is important to remember that the above are just guidelines. The physical activity programme undertaken by a client suffering from depression, should be tailored to their individual preferences. It is recommended that the person undertake a PAR-Q or other similar pre-exercise questionnaires before commencing any training, particularly if their is a possibility of other co-morbidities&lt;ref name=&quot;IP&quot;&gt;Richardson CR, Faulkner G, McDevitt J, Skrinar GS, Hutchinson DS, Piette JD (2005) Integrating Physical Activity Into Mental Health Services for Persons With Serious Mental Illness. http://ps.psychiatryonline.org Vol. 56 (3)&lt;/ref&gt;.  

'''One of the most important considerations when building the exercise program, is to make it fun and interesting for the client whilst keeping all activities and goals achievable.''' It may also be beneficial to introduce new exercise settings to encourage and motivate the client as well. Successful exercise programmes give the client a sense of achievement, mastery and build confidence&lt;ref name=&quot;ADrev&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Lastly, the program needs to be flexible in order to encourage and challenge the participant through normal exercise adaptions&lt;ref name=&quot;ADrev&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

== EXERCISE SETTING  ==
Where is best for a client to exercise? 
*At Home
*At the Gym
*In a Group 
*By themselves
There is currently inconclusive evidence as to the benefits of exercise setting on depression scores. Research has not shown significant differences between exercising in a group or individual setting&lt;ref name=&quot;L&amp;H&quot;&gt;Legrand F, Heuze JP (2007) Antidepressant Effects Associated with Different Exercise Conditions in Participants with Depression: A Pilot Study. Journal of Sport and Exercise Physiology. Vol. 29 Pp. 348-364 &lt;/ref&gt;, or between exercising at home or in a supervised setting i.e. at gym&lt;ref name=&quot;BLU&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. Decreased drop out rates have been observed in 'at home' exercise programmes when compared to group exercise classes in older adults&lt;ref name=&quot;BLU&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. '''Varying exercise settings to suit patients is advised to enhance participant participation.'''

== IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS ==

Decreased participation rates may be observed in depressed individuals due to symptoms of their disease. Some common symptoms of depression include: 

# Fatigue
# Lack of energy
# Hopelessness
# Psychomotor retardation

Monitoring fitness gains and exercise performance throughout an exercise programme may provide positive feedback and encourage further participation &lt;ref name=&quot;MB&quot;&gt;Meyer T, Broocks A (2000) Therapeutic impact of exercise on psychiatric diseases: guidelines for exercise testing and prescription. Sports Medicine. Vol. 30 (4). pp. 269-279&lt;/ref&gt; for your client. It is also important to monitor their depression levels throughout exercise programmes to make sure the workload is manageable and helpful in managing the client’s mental illness.

Insulin Resistance (IR) is a condition in which the cells of the body become resistant to the effects of insulin. Thus, a person is said to have impaired glucose tolerance / pre-diabetes. IR results in higher levels of insulin being required to maintain normal blood glucose levels. Eventually, the pancreas may be unable to keep up with insulin demand leading to long term health issues.

*''1 in 4 adults in Australia may at some time in their life have impaired glucose tolerance''

*''Being diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance does not necessarily mean you will develop diabetes, but it makes you 10-20 times more likely than a normal person''

*''It is estimated that up to 1.8 million Australians are living with diabetes / impaired glucose tolerance''

Insulin Resistance (IR) is a condition in which the cells of the body become resistant to the effects of insulin. Thus, a person is said to have impaired glucose tolerance / pre-diabetes. IR results in higher levels of insulin being required to maintain normal blood glucose levels. Eventually, the pancreas may be unable to keep up with insulin demand leading to long term health issues.

*''1 in 4 adults in Australia may at some time in their life have impaired glucose tolerance''

*''Being diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance does not necessarily mean you will develop diabetes, but it makes you 10-20 times more likely than a normal person''

*''It is estimated that up to 1.8 million Australians are living with diabetes / impaired glucose tolerance''

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''What is Hypertension?'''&lt;br /&gt;
Hypertension can also be referred to as high blood pressure. This condition is simply a greater amount of pressure in the arteries which causes an increased work load for the heart each time it pumps. Long term hypertension could lead to heart attack (heart failure), stoke and many other conditions that could lead to premature death.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''What Causes Hypertension?'''&lt;br /&gt;
Genetics has a big role to play in blood pressure, although there are many factors that can lead to hypertension or the increased risk of hypertension. These factors include:
* Obesity
* Diabetes
* Increased sodium (salt) intake
* Sedentary Lifestyle
* Stress
* Lack of physical activity
* Smoking
* And many more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''What are the Symptoms of Hypertension?'''&lt;br /&gt;
There are not always symptoms for those people with moderate to low high blood pressure. Although if you have extreme hypertension then you may experience symptoms like:
* Headaches
* Fatigue
* Breathing difficulties
* Irregular Heart beat&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Physical Activity and Hypertension'''&lt;br /&gt;
As can be seen from the causes of this condition, obesity and being sedentary are two main sources for increasing blood pressure. Physical activity on the other hand, is highly likely to reduce body weight and will also reduce the amount of sedentary behaviour of a person. Therefore, physical activity may be a better long term treatment for this condition that any medication. It has been proven that endurance training results in a decrease in Blood pressure&lt;ref&gt;Ehsani, A. Goldring, D. Hagberg, J. Hernandez, A. Holloszy, J. Sincore, D. 2007. “Effect of weight training on blood pressure and hemodynamics in hypertensive adolescents” St Louis, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt; and some studies have also suggested that weights training may also induce a decrease in blood pressure. So where from here?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Physical Activity Recommendations'''&lt;br /&gt;
If you were to undergo a weights training program, there would be a reduction in blood pressure slightly, although once you stop that weights program, there is evidence that your blood pressure would then return back to its original level. Rhythmic or dynamic movement such as walking or swimming seems to reduce Hypertension the quickest with a higher chance of maintaining this blood pressure. A study conducted in Canada found that moderate intensity (leisurely) dynamic exercise, done for 40-60 at a time and conducted 3-4 times a week is the fasted way to decrease blood pressure for those people who have mild hypertension&lt;ref&gt;Cleroux, J. Feldman, R. Petrella, R. (1999) “Recommendations on physical exercise training.” Canadian Medical Association pp21-28.&lt;/ref&gt; . Vigorous exercise will still reduce blood pressure, such as a weights program although it is not going to produce as fast results. This study also found that the lower the initial level of physical activity the greater expectation to the reduction in blood pressure. Although these are the optimal level of physical activity for reducing blood pressure, any exercise or physical activity are far better than none at all.&lt;br /&gt;

===Diabetes===
It is a serious medical condition that affects of people that blood sugar is higher level than normal , and there are two types of diabetes&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;&gt;Campbell, L (2008). Diabetes Overview. Diabetes Website: http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/diseases/facts/diabetes.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Type 2 Diabetes===
Benefits of regular physical activities such as walking in prevention and control of type 2 diabetes are becoming well known. Studies correlating the effects of walking are conducted &lt;ref name=&quot;Hays&quot;&gt;.Hays, L.M. &amp; Clark, D.O. (1999).,L.M.&amp;Clark, D.O. (1999). Correlates of physical activity in a sample of older adults with type 2 diabetes.

Effects of different modes of exercise training on glucose control and risk factors for complications in type 2 diabetic patients. Diabetes Care, 29:11, 2518-2527.&lt;/ref&gt;.Snowling &amp; Hopkins (2006) and others. This paper seeks to correlate walking and control of type 2 diabetes based on the literature present in the field. Also, it would provide recommendation for people affected by type 2 diabetes.
Generally, diabetes is caused by combination of genetic and lifestyle factors and it affects a large percentage of the world’s population. In the US alone, 10% of the population is diagnosed with diabetes &lt;ref name=&quot;Calton&quot;&gt;•Calton, B.A., Chang, S.C., Wright, M.E., Kipnis, V., Lawson, K., Thompson, F.E., Subar, A.F., Mouw, T., Campbell, D.S., Hurwitz, P., Hollenbeck, A., Schatzkin, A., &amp; Leitzmann, M.F.

== Walking to control type 2 diabetes ==
Physical activities are important in management and control of type 2 diabetes&lt;ref name=&quot;Sigal&quot;&gt;Sigal, R.J., Kenny, G.P., Boule, N.G., Wells, G.A., Prud’homme, D., Fortler, M., Reld, R.D., Tulloch, H., Coyle, D., Phillips, P., Jennings, A., &amp; Jaffey, J. (2007). Effects of aerobic and resistance training on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. Annals of Internal Medicine, 147:6, 358-369.&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alberti&quot;&gt;•Alberti, K.G., Zimmet, P., &amp; Shaw, J. (2007). International Diabetes Federation: a consensus on type 2 diabetes prevention. Diabetic Medicine, 24, 451-463.&lt;/ref&gt;.In the studies &lt;ref name=&quot;Sigal&quot;&gt;Sigal, R.J., Kenny, G.P., Boule, N.G., Wells, G.A., Prud’homme, D., Fortler, M., Reld, R.D., Tulloch, H., Coyle, D., Phillips, P., Jennings, A., &amp; Jaffey, J. (2007). Effects of aerobic and resistance training on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. Annals of Internal Medicine, 147:6, 358-369.&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cuff&quot;&gt; •Cuff, D.J., Meneilly, G.S., Martin, A., Ignaszewski, A., Tildesley, H.D., &amp; Frohlich, J.J. (2003). Effective exercise modality to reduce insulin resistance in women with type 2 diabetes. Diabetes Care, 26:11, 2977-2982.&lt;/ref&gt;.structured aerobic exercises such as walking reduces the absolute haemoglobin A1c value by about 0.6% and improves insulin sensitivity. The study proves that aerobic training such as walking combined with resistance training improves glycaemic control. &lt;ref name=&quot;Yamanouchi&quot;&gt;•Yamanouchi, K., Shinozaki, T., Chikada, K., Nishikawa, T., Ito, K., Shimizu, S., Ozawa, N., Suzuki, Y., Maeno, H., Kato, K., Oshida, Y., &amp; Sata, Y. (1995). Daily walking combined with diet therapy is a useful means for obese NIDDM patients not only to reduce body weight but also to improve insulin sensitivity. Diabetes Care, 18, 775-778.&lt;/ref&gt;.suggests that daily walking combined with diet therapy is useful for obese patients and can likewise work with type 2 diabetes.
Although it is evident that physical activities such as walking helps control type 2 diabetes, 60-80% of the adult population in the US do not meet the recommended levels of physical activity &lt;ref name=&quot;Hays&quot;&gt;Hays,L.M.&amp;Clark, D.O. (1999). Correlates of physical activity in a sample of older adults with type 2 diabetes. Diabetes Care, 22:5, 706-712.&lt;/ref&gt;.Much of this low engagement in physical activities such as walking is correlated to the fear of walking alone and the risk of danger while walking outside &lt;ref name=&quot;Foster&quot;&gt;Foster, C., Hillsdon, M., Thorogood, M., (2004). Environmental perceptions and walking in English adults. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, 58:11, 924-928.&lt;/ref&gt;.This is in congruence to the study &lt;ref name=&quot;Van Dam&quot;&gt;Van Dam, R.M. (2003). The epidemiology of lifestyle and risk for type 2 diabetes. European Journal of Epidemiology, 12:18, 1115-1125.&lt;/ref&gt;.which states that lifestyle has an important role in reducing risk for type 2 diabetes since lifestyle is a factor in the development of type 2 diabetes. Lack of interest in physical activity being part of lifestyle particularly in the US prevents people with type 2 diabetes to engage in walking or exercise&lt;ref name=&quot;Hays&quot;&gt;Hays,L.M.&amp;Clark, D.O. (1999). Correlates of physical activity in a sample of older adults with type 2 diabetes. Diabetes Care, 22:5, 706-712.&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Dam&quot;&gt;Van Dam, R.M. (2003). The epidemiology of lifestyle and risk for type 2 diabetes. European Journal of Epidemiology, 12:18, 1115-1125.&lt;/ref&gt;.
People who engage in physical activities including walking have a lower risk of chronic diseases including diabetes &lt;ref name=&quot;Foster&quot;&gt;Foster, C., Hillsdon, M., Thorogood, M.,(2004). Environmental perceptions and walking in English adults. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, 58:11, 924-928.&lt;/ref&gt;.Brisk walking was associated with low risk of type 2 diabetes compared with regular walking &lt;ref name=&quot;Van Dam&quot;&gt;Van Dam, R.M. (2003). The epidemiology of lifestyle and risk for type 2 diabetes. European Journal of Epidemiology, 12:18, 1115-1125.&lt;/ref&gt;.Quickly striding for a day, according to Christensen (1999)&lt;ref name=&quot;Christensen&quot;&gt;Christensen, D. (1999). Brisk steps can reduce diabetes risk. Science News, 156:17, 260.&lt;/ref&gt;.can reduce a woman’s risk of developing diabetes by 50%. In fact, he suggested simple ways to add enough exercise such as walking to the bus stop in the morning, walking several flights of stairs, or doing house chores. These physical activities help reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. Higher levels of walking are associated reduced mortality risk and help control glucose levels of people with type 2 diabetes&lt;ref name=&quot;Greeg&quot;&gt;•Gregg, E.W., Gerzoff, R.B., Caspersen, C.J., Williamson, D.F., &amp; Narayan, K.M. (2003). Relationship of walking to mortality among US adults with diabetes. Arch Intern Med, 163, 1440-1447.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
== Recommendations ==
*People with type 2 diabetes who seek improvement should perform both aerobic and resistance training &lt;ref name=&quot;Sigal&quot;&gt;Sigal, R.J., Kenny, G.P., Boule, N.G., Wells, G.A., Prud’homme, D., Fortler, M., Reld, R.D., Tulloch, H., Coyle, D., Phillips, P., Jennings, A., &amp; Jaffey, J. (2007). Effects of aerobic and resistance training on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. Annals of Internal Medicine, 147:6, 358-369.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
*The study conducted by Gregg, et.al (2003) suggests that walking is associated with lower mortality among adults with diabetes. One death per year for every 61 people may be prevented by encouraging the people to walk at least 2 hours a week &lt;ref name=&quot;Greeg&quot;&gt;•Gregg, E.W., Gerzoff, R.B., Caspersen, C.J., Williamson, D.F., &amp; Narayan, K.M. (2003). Relationship of walking to mortality among US adults with diabetes. Arch Intern Med, 163, 1440-1447.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
*As Christensen (1999))&lt;ref name=&quot;Christensen&quot;&gt;Christensen, D. (1999). Brisk steps can reduce diabetes risk. Science News, 156:17, 260.&lt;/ref&gt;. suggested, “Walking is a practical activity that is within everyone’s ability. Staving off complications of diabetes for even few years could have a major impact.” Projects such as group walks with trained volunteers can help people with type 2 diabetes participate in walks and reduce the fear of walking alone&lt;ref name=&quot;Foster&quot;&gt;Foster, C., Hillsdon, M., Thorogood, M., (2004).

=== What is Sarcopenia? ===
Sarcopenia refers to the gradual decline in muscle mass and increase in adipose storage as a result of aging &lt;ref name=&quot;kamel&quot;&gt;Kamel, H. K. (2003). Sarcopenia and Aging. Nutrition Reviews, 61(5 pt 1), 157-67.&lt;/ref&gt;. Not to be confused with atrophy, the degradation of muscle due to inactivity, rather as a result of muscle wastage. It is linked with:

* functional disability &lt;ref name=&quot;kamel&quot;/&gt;
* falls &lt;ref name=&quot;kamel&quot;/&gt;
* decreased bone density &lt;ref name=&quot;kamel&quot;/&gt;
* glucose intolerance &lt;ref name=&quot;kamel&quot;/&gt;
* decreased hot and cold tolerance &lt;ref name=&quot;kamel&quot;/&gt;


There are various molecular mediators that are affected by these age related changes including fiber size and strength, mitochondrial homeostasis and apoptosis. Factors that further effect sarcopenia are: 

* physical inactivity &lt;ref name=&quot;kamel&quot;/&gt;
* malnutrition &lt;ref name=&quot;kamel&quot;/&gt;
* oxidative stress &lt;ref name=&quot;kamel&quot;/&gt;

Between the ages of 50-70 years there is an approximate 30% reduction in muscle strength as a result of sarcopenia. &lt;ref name=&quot;vella&quot;&gt;Vella, C., &amp; Kravitz, L. (n.d.). Sarcopenia: The Mystery of Muscle Loss. Exercise Science at UNM. Retrieved October 24, 2011, from http://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/sarcopenia.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resistance Exercise in Reducing Sarcopenia ==
Evidence has shown that resistance training is the best way to slow or reverse sarcopenia&lt;ref name=&quot;camp&quot;&gt;Campbell, W. W. (2007). Synergistic Use of Higher Protein Diets or Nutritional Supplements With RT to Counter Sarcopenia. Nutrition Reviews, 65(9), 416-22.&lt;/ref&gt;. Resistance training enhances strength, power and mobility function and induces skeletal muscle hypertrophy. In the elderly resistance training also induces the muscle expression of IGF-I, myogenic regulator factors and IL-6 to contribute to muscular hypertrophy by regulating function of satellite cells, which in turn will assist in preventing the onset of sarcopenia.&lt;ref name=&quot;sakuma&quot;&gt;Sakuma, K., &amp; Yamaguchi, A. (2010). Molecular Mechanisms in aging and current strategies to counteract sarcopenia. Current Aging Science, 3(2), 90-101.&lt;/ref&gt; Even just one session of resistance exercise for elders can enhance the synthesis rate of muscle protein. &lt;ref name=&quot;camp&quot;/&gt; 
Resistance training also enhances the nervous system leading to an improved functional capacity during everyday tasks. This is because the loss of muscle mass with aging may be the result of impaired capacity for axonal reinnervation of deinnervated muscle fibers, which would attribute to the enhancement of the nervous system through resistance training.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaa&quot;&gt;Aagaard, P., Suetta, C., Caserotti, P., Magnusson, S. P., &amp; Kjaer, M. (2010). Role of the nervous system in sarcopenia and muscle atrophy with aging: strength training as a countermeasure.. Scandinavian Journal Of Medicine &amp; Science In Sports, 20(1), 49-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recommendations==
Although the following guidelines are best for reducing the effects of sarcopenia, a participant who is involved in any form of resistance training is better then one who doesn't train at all.
* Complete 8-10 exercises involving all the major muscle groups. Multi-joint exercises are recommended. &lt;ref name=&quot;vella&quot;/&gt;
* Have the participant perform 10-15 repitions of each exercises &lt;ref name=&quot;vella&quot;/&gt;
* 1 set of each exercise is sufficient for elderly clients &lt;ref name=&quot;vella&quot;/&gt;
* The intensity of exercise should be 'somewhat hard', roughly 12 or 13 on the Borg's scale &lt;ref name=&quot;vella&quot;/&gt;
* Resistance training should be performed at least twice a week, with 48 hours between each session &lt;ref name=&quot;vella&quot;/&gt;

In addition, adequate protein and energy intake are key for further management of sarcopenia. &lt;ref&gt;Rolland, Y., Dupuy, C., Abellan van Kan, G., Gillette, S., &amp; Vellas, B. (2011). Treatment Strategies for sarcopenia and frailty. The Medical Clinics of North American, 95(3), 427-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Considerations ===

When determining the amount and frequency of a strength program, attention to overloading the patient needs to be considered as intensive regimes will decrease the effective gain in muscle strength and mass in the elderly &lt;ref name=&quot;sakuma&quot;/&gt;. Ensure the program is individualized to the participants needs and current health status. 

Correct technique must be maintained at all times, as the injury risk in the elderly is much greater. Have caution with eccentric training as this creates greater muscle soreness in this population. Free weights are excellent tools to use as they not only increase strength but also balance and coordination. &lt;ref name=&quot;vella&quot;/&gt;

* &lt;font size=3&gt;The first meters came into use in 1950 and were used only in post offices. They were inscribed “JAPANESE POSTAGE”. Since then, all stamps have Japanese inscription 日 本 郵 便 (Japanese Post) in one form or another in the frank and a country name in English in the town mark as follows:
:: 1952 –1965 “JAPAN”
:: 1965 –1977 “JAPAN” (private use) / “NIPPON” (Post Office use)
:: 1977 onward “NIPPON”

* The stamps are grouped as follows:
:: A - frameless horizontal or square design with Mount Fuji motif, circular town mark
:: B - small horizontal, straight-line rectangle
:: C - square frank, dove with spread wings at bottom
:: D - upright frank, single-line frame and ornamental corners
:: E - nearly square frank, double wavy border at top, Mount Fuji motif with curled corners at bottom
:: F - frameless horizontal design with Mount Fuji motif, straight-line town mark
:: G - frameless horizontal design with flying dove over globe motif
:: H - small, upright frank with notched, single-line frame
:: I - nearly square frank with simulated-perforation border
:: J - nearly square frank, unframed, with country inscription vertical at left
:: PO - designs used only in post offices
:: PV - designs used only in self-service stamp vending machines

* &lt;u&gt;Three vertical lines at right of stamp&lt;/u&gt;: In 1965 all new and replacement private use meter dies were required to include three bold vertical lines along the right edge. This made the stamps compatible with new automatic mail sorting equipment. Fielded meters in use at the time were exempt. In later years, some Post Office and Self-Service meter stamps also included the three lines.
* &lt;u&gt;Year of the Emperor&lt;/u&gt;: Stamps are found occasionally with the year of the reigning monarch rather than Western year.

* For specialized information about the meter stamps of Japan, see ''Handbook of Japanese Meter Stamps'', compiled by the Meter Stamp Unit of the Japan Philatelic Society, Inc., 2000.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
On March 11, 2011, an 8.9 magnitude earthquake struck just off the coast of Japan. The tsunami wave, which was over 130 feet tall at its peak, compounded the destruction caused by the earthquake. 15,839 residents were killed, and thousands more were left injured or homeless&lt;ref&gt; National Police Agency of Japan. (December 2, 2011). 
Damage situation and police countermeasures  associated with 2011 Tohoku district - off the Pacific Ocean earthquake. From: http://www.npa.go.jp/archive/keibi/biki/higaijokyo_e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. The earthquake also caused instability and potential meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear reactors. 

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_Nuclear_Power_Plant Fukushima Daiichi nuclear facility] is a compound of six reactors owned and maintained by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Electric_Power_Company Tokyo Electric Power Company] (TEPCO). It is located only 150 miles outside of Tokyo, Japan, making the potential of a nuclear meltdown even more threatening. A fifteen meter tall tsunami wave caused by the earthquake struck the Fukushima power plant flooding all six reactors and causing a series of operational failures. Following the tsunami, TEPCO workers struggled to repair the nuclear reactors as the water flooding the plants contained radioactive waste in toxic concentrations. Unable to repair the reactors, nuclear meltdown occurred as the fuel rods were exposed, which released nuclear particles into the air. The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Nuclear_Event_Scale International Nuclear Event Scales] (INES) rated the Fukushima nuclear disaster a seven. A rating of seven is the worst possible rating as it is indicative of widespread contamination that is likely to have long term effects on both human health and the environment.

==Technical Success==
The ability to generate power through a self-sustaining [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission nuclear fission] reaction was demonstrated when the world's first nuclear reactor, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Pile-1 Chicago Pile-1], came on-line at the University of Chicago in 1942. Since 1942, the technology has continued to improve. In 1956, Calder Hall came on-line in England as the first commercial nuclear power plant. The number of nuclear reactors continued to grow rapidly until the first nuclear reactor scare in 1979. In Pennsylvania, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident Three Mile Island nuclear reactor] had a meltdown of the nuclear core in one of its units. While the meltdown did not release significant levels of radioactive material into the atmosphere, this incident did spark citizen concern over the possibility of a more dangerous nuclear incident. In 1986, a much worse nuclear disaster struck in the Ukraine. The nuclear power plant [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster Chernobyl] experienced a complete loss of containment, causing approximately one million premature deaths because of the nuclear particles released into the air&lt;ref&gt; Alexey V. Yablokov; Vassily B. Nesterenko; Alexey V. Nesterenko (2009). Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment (Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences) (paperback ed.). Wiley-Blackwell. ISBN 978-1573317573. &lt;/ref&gt;. The disaster at Chernobyl is considered the worst nuclear power incident in world history and is ranked a seven on the INES. Figure 1 illustrates how following the Chernobyl incident many nations halted the construction of new nuclear power plants, although they continued to rely on those already constructed&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, T. (September 23, 2011). Nuclear Power Safety Concerns. Council on Foreign Relations. From: http://www.cfr.org/europerussia/nuclear-power-safety-concerns/p10534 &lt;/ref&gt;. [[Image:Nuclear Power History.png|thumb|left| Figure 1: History of the use of nuclear power (top) and the number of active nuclear power plants (bottom).]]

In addition to safety considerations, cost is a key factor in a government's decision to build and use a nuclear power plant. As illustrated in Figure 2, a series of studies from 2004 to 2008 show that nuclear power is  a more expensive form of energy than coal or gas. [[File:Nuke, coal, gas generating costs.png|thumb| Figure 2: Cost comparison of nuclear, coal, and gas power.]] However, these studies did not account for the additional costs of energy dependence, pollution, or health impacts as a result of each energy source. While nuclear power is not as cheap as coal or oil, it is more affordable than many other alternative and sustainable energy options. Nuclear energy costs about $0.04 per kWh, which is more affordable than [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Lentis/Wind_Energy:_Green_or_Not%3F wind] ($0.08), natural gas ($0.11), or solar ($0.22) energy. &lt;ref&gt;Morgan, J. (April 20, 2010). Comparing Energy Costs of Nuclear, Coal, Gas, Wind, and Solar. Nuclear Fissionary. From: http://nuclearfissionary.com/2010/04/02/comparing-energy-costs-of-nuclear-coal-gas-wind-and-solar/&lt;/ref&gt;

Technological developments in nuclear power are helping to reduce the costs of energy generation as well as decrease safety concerns. Prior to the Fukushima Meltdown there were 436 nuclear power plants operating worldwide, which were responsible for supplying approximately 15% of the world's electricity &lt;ref&gt;Joskow, P., Parsons, J. (2009). The economic future of nuclear power. Daedalus. From: http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/daed.2009.138.4.45&lt;/ref&gt;. Many of these plants were built over 20 years ago, with outdated containment technologies. The designs for new nuclear power plants, known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_III_reactor Generation III] and the hypothetical [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_IV_reactor Generation IV] designs, have the potential to address many of the safety hazards due to old plants and poor designs&lt;ref&gt;Office of Nuclear Energy. (2006). Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative. U.S. Department of Energy. From: http://www.ne.doe.gov/pdfFiles/GENIV.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. However, nuclear power has never been defined by its technical capabilities alone.  Japan's earthquake drew attention to the potential hazards of a nuclear meltdown and caused many nations to evaluate their positions on nuclear power.

==Environmental Opinion==
Nuclear energy continues to be subject to debate among environmental groups.  Although nuclear energy is efficient and does not produce greenhouse gases, it is not truly renewable and remains a potential safety hazard.

[[w:Greenpeace|Greenpeace]] opposes all further development of nuclear energy because of the potential risks that it poses to the environment.  They cite the lack of procedure for dealing with nuclear waste as a major issue and think that money spent on developing nuclear energy would not have as great an impact on the environment as investing in truly renewable sources.  According to [[w:MIT|MIT]], 1000 new nuclear reactors would have to be built to have a significant impact on [[w:global warming|global warming]] which will not happen with the current growth of 4% in the nuclear energy sector &lt;ref&gt;Climate Change-Nuclear not the Answer. Greenpeace. From: http://www.greenpeace.org/international/PageFiles/24507/briefing-nuclear-not-answer-apr07.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.  The Nuclear Information and Resource Service (NIRS) asserts that every dollar spent on nuclear energy is a dollar not spent on renewable energy sources&lt;ref&gt;A simple statement on nuclear energy. From: http://www.nirs.org/petition2/index.php?r=sb&lt;/ref&gt;

[[w:Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy|Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy]] (EFN) describes nuclear energy as &quot;The only clean, safe energy source capable of ensuring the continuation of our industrial civilization while protecting the environment&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Bruno Comby (Unknown) Benifits of Nuclear Energy. From: http://www.ecolo.org/base/baseen.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.  Nuclear energy uses less construction materials per kWh than wind and solar making it greener to build.  As vehicles become more dependent on electricity, nuclear energy is the only available energy source that will be able to supply the additional power required without emitting greenhouse gasses.  Because nuclear energy is the only massively available energy source, EFN supports the rapid deployment of nuclear reactors to move away from dependency on fossil fuels.  EFN also cites the Three Mile Island incident as a success story for the safety of nuclear energy, because, despite a meltdown, the safety equipment at the reactor contained almost all of the radiation and there were no serious injuries or deaths.

==Fallout Spreads Across Europe==
In 2009, Germany produced over 125 billion kilowatt hours of power at its nuclear plants &lt;ref&gt;Independent Statistics and Analysis. (2009). International Energy Statistics. U.S. Energy Information Administration. From: http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/iedindex3.cfm?tid=2&amp;pid=27&amp;aid=12&amp;cid=GM,&amp;syid=2005&amp;eyid=2009&amp;unit=BKWH&lt;/ref&gt;. Just two years later Germany's Chancellor, Angela Merkel, has pledged to phase out all dependence on nuclear energy by 2022 &lt;ref&gt;Dempsey, J., Ewing, J. (May 30, 2011). Germany, in Reversal, Will Close Nuclear Plants by 2022. The New York Times. From: http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/31/world/europe/31germany.html&lt;/ref&gt;. This will require decommissioning all seventeen of the country's nuclear plants and finding alternative energy sources to power the nation. This abrupt change in nuclear policy is a direct result of the Japanese nuclear scare&lt;ref&gt; Unknown. (March 14, 2011).

As described by German journalist, Elmer Jehn, &quot;Since Japan, every sensible person knows that nuclear energy is dead&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Harding, L. (March 15, 2011). Angela Merkel switches off seven nuclear power plants. The Guardian. From: http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/15/germany-merkel-switches-nuclear-power-off&lt;/ref&gt;. While there has always been some opposition in Germany to nuclear power, the voice of the opposition has grown stronger since the Fukushima disaster.

(May 30, 2011). France expands nuclear plans despite Fukushima. BBC. From: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13595455 &lt;/ref&gt;. In Great Britain, public support for nuclear power has grown since Fukushima with support over the last year rising by 3%. In 2010, 38% of Britons believed the benefits of nuclear power were greater than the risks, and in August of 2011, this number had grown to 41% &lt;ref&gt;Jha, A. (September 8, 2011). UK public confidence in nuclear remains steady despite Fukushima. The Guardain. From: http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/sep/09/nuclear-power-popular-in-uk&lt;/ref&gt;. Across Europe there is little consensus about whether nuclear power presents a clean sustainable alternative to coal and oil, or a deadly threat.

== United States of America ==
The battle over nuclear energy continues in the United States, arguments nearly unchanged by the nuclear disaster in Japan &lt;ref&gt;Steve Hargreaves (5 April 2011) Climate hawks still support nuclear power. From: http://money.cnn.com/2011/04/05/news/economy/nuclear_japan_support/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. Groups such as the Environmental Defense Fund argue that the earthquake illustrates the need for sound regulations and building codes, but should not be a deterrent from building new nuclear plants so long as companies and regulators take the right precautions &lt;ref&gt;Environmental Defense Fund (25 July 2011) Summer 2011 Talk Back. From: http://solutions.edf.org/2011/07/12/summer-2011-talk-back/&lt;/ref&gt;. Others argue on the grounds of America's need to sustain our competitive advantage. As India and China continue to pursue alternative energy, proponents believe that we cannot fall behind.

Public opinion about nuclear energy in the United States has been on an upward trend since the 1980's.  The most recent poll conducted by the Nuclear Energy Institute in June 2010, found that 74% of Americans favor nuclear energy.  The NEI also found that those who strongly favor nuclear energy outnumber those who strongly oppose it about three to one &lt;ref&gt;Perspective on Public Opinion (June 2010) NEI. From: http://www.nei.org/resourcesandstats/documentlibrary/publications/perspectiveonpublicopinion/perspective-on-public-opinion-june-2010/&lt;/ref&gt;.  However, after the Japanese earthquake in 2011, public opinion has started to swing back.  In polling done one week after the earthquake, CNN found that only 54% of Americans favored nuclear power as an energy source.  Although two-thirds of Americans oppose building new nuclear reactors (a number that was unchanged by the earthquake) 60% of Americans oppose reducing dependency on nuclear energy if it would result in higher electric costs &lt;ref&gt;PollingReport.com. From: http://www.pollingreport.com/energy.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Worldwide Reactions==
After the Fukushima disaster, international governments and peoples have mixed feelings about the future of nuclear energy.  In a international poll of twelve countries that currently use nuclear reactors there is mixed opinion about the nuclear energy.  Four of the twelve countries, Germany, Mexico, Spain and Russia, support shutting down nuclear reactors, while seven, China, Pakistan, US, UK, Brazil, France, Japan, favor continued support of nuclear energy.  India was evenly split&lt;ref&gt;World Nuclear News (25 November 2011) Patchy global support for nuclear new-build. From: http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NP_Patchy_global_support_for_nuclear_new_build_2511111.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  China and India plan to add a combined 80 new nuclear reactors over the next two decades.  The countries slowed construction to ensure they met safety standards, but were generally unfazed by the disaster &lt;ref&gt; Jim Hoagland (6 October 2011) Nuclear energy after Fukushima. From: http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/nuclear-energy-after-fukushima/2011/10/05/gIQAbxIFRL_story.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  In addition, Bangladesh has made significant progress in opening its first nuclear power plant and has undergone an international review by the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency International Atomic Energy Agency] (IAEA).  The government of Bangladesh has been working with Russia to purchase the components for the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant project &lt;ref&gt;Bangladesh Progresses Toward Nuclear Power, IAED. From: http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/2011/bangladeshprog.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  Despite the Russian government's interest in selling nuclear technologies, the 43% of Russians now favor the immediate shut down of all nuclear reactors.  This number has more than doubled since 2005.

== Generalizable Lesson ==
The success or failure of nuclear energy depends on a variety of factors including political climate, [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Lentis/Popular_Perceptions_of_Nuclear_Power public opinions], natural resources, and energy needs. Each country makes its own decisions about nuclear power and the response it makes to a nuclear disaster. Following the meltdown of the Fukushima reactor, many countries began to reevaluate their nuclear policies. Though most would view any disaster as a deterrent, most country's nuclear programs remain unchanged with some continuing to grow.  

An additional factor that must be considered is the small number of deaths associated with the Fukushima disaster. As only two deaths were reported to be caused by the nuclear meltdown, the perceived safety of nuclear energy will likely not be diminished as much as a larger scale disaster such as Chernobyl.

Germany's reaction, however, shows that a single event can be a tipping point in nuclear policy. As public support for nuclear energy waned, Chancellor Merkel used the Fukushima disaster to spark her move to decommission all of Germany's reactors by 2022.  

The Russian government continues to support nuclear energy despite a doubling in opposition over the last five years.  The support comes from the governments goal to reduce the nations dependency on natural gas, though it is the worlds largest natural gas exporter. Russia also has the world's second largest coal reserves and is the largest non OPEC producer of petroleum. Following the Fukushima disaster, Russia continues plans to build 28 new reactors, and will perform tests on all current reactors to determine their ability to withstand a major earthquake. The response in Russia is an example of the government acting against the will of its people despite sitting on abundant energy resources&lt;ref&gt; Nuclear power in Russia, Wikipedia. From: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_Russia&lt;/ref&gt;.

China and India continue to rapidly expand their nuclear programs because of the high projections for energy consumption that they face. Both countries believe that nuclear energy is the only way to cheaply power their nations in the coming years, though have reevaluated the safety requirements following the Fukushima disaster.

Any event, large or small, can have an effect on policy, but it is not solely the event that determines the effect. Each country's reaction can be seen as the country acting in its own interests. As show, a major event can cause a rapid change in a country's policies or it can simply result in slight reevaluation of policy and procedure. This effect is similar to that of the response to the rise of graffiti. Some localities simply tried to ban the sale of spray paint, while others embraced graffiti as an art form and opened up walls for the artists to paint. Both measures attempted to solve the problem of vandalism, just like any policy made after the Fukushima disaster will try to solve the problem of safely providing energy to a nation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;h2&gt;Definitions You Should Know&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Core and Periphery&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt; The concept of a developed core surrounded by an undeveloped periphery. This concept can be applied at various scales&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;Ecological Footprint&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt; The theoretical measurement of the amount of land or water a population requires to produce the resources it consumes and to absorb its waste under prevailing technology.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;Global Climate Change&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt; The changes in global patterns of rainfall and temperature, sea level habitats and the incidences of droughts, floods and storms, resulting from changes in the Earth's atmosphere, believed to be mainly caused by the enhanced greenhouse effect.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;GNI (Gross National Income)&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The total value of goods and services produced within a country together with the balance of income and payments from other countries.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;Migration&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt; The movement of people, involving a change of residence. It can be internal or external (international) and voluntary or forced. It does not include temporary circulations such as commuting or tourism.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;Remittances&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt; The transfer of money/goods by foreign workers to their home countries.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;Soil Degradation &lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt; A severe reduction in the quality of soils. The term includes soul erosion, salinization and soil exhaustion (loss of fertility).&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


Africa and North America are two contrasting countries. The most obvious one being that Africa is a less economically developed country and North America is a more economically developed country. Many factors convey why a country is either named an LEDC or a MEDC. These factors include birth rates, mortality rates, fertility rates, and life expectancy. Birth rates in Africa tend to be higher because there’s limited education about birth control. Africa also has one of the highest death rates because of the poor healthcare and lifestyles. One large element that relates to deaths is HIV/AIDS, which has spread in many parts of Africa and causes millions of deaths over years. The lack of birth control has not helped this situation and has also led to infant deaths. However, in North America the numbers are much lower because large families are not ideal. Women are mostly in the workforce and all are not focused on having families. There is also a better healthcare system and living environment which establishes healthy surroundings for children. Also, birth control is commonly used. North America has the lowest mortality numbers across the board. However, fertility rates have recently made a gradual increase.

LEDC’s are usually pretty recognizable. This is because their population pyramids usually have expansive concave sides or straight sides (stage 1 and 2 countries). This type of pyramid indicates that there are many youth in the country and not a lot of elderly. It shows that the life expectancy is not high, but that the birth rates are very high. Some countries are a little more developed than the least developed countries, but are still considered to be LEDC’s because there is a range, and a country doesn’t really become ‘more economically developed’ until it hits stage 3. 

The characteristics common to MEDC’s are that they tend to have a higher population in the workforce, and a higher elderly population. The life expectancy is very high. The pyramid if an MEDC would be more convex. The birth rates are also much lower and families are smaller. Countries like Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia are stages 3 and 4. When observing the population pyramid for Russia, it is noticed that they probably have the largest elderly population of any country. While Canada has a noticeably large number of people at the working age because Canada is a country open to migration to support the country. 

'''Problems faced in LEDC cities'''
•	Poor electricity and power supplies •	Pollution •	Lack of clean water •	Few employment opportunities
•	Traffic problems • Poverty •	Drugs, gangs and violence •	Poor education and health provision •	Poor sewerage systems •	Poor rubbish collection •	Lack of shelter 


'''Population Pyramids''' 

-	tell us about the age and sex structure of a population
-	a prediction of what the future population will look like 
-	help the gov. to plan services, and facilities (such as schools, and hospitals) which are needed for the future
-	also shows the employed population group 

'''Population momentum''': is the tendency for population to grow despite a fall in birth rate or fertility levels. It is also the tendency for a population to continue to fall despite a rise in the birth rate. 

'''Doubling time''': is the length of time it takes for a population to double in size, assuming the natural growth rate remains constant. 

'''Population projections''': are predictions about future population based on trends in fertility, mortality, and migration. 

'''The dependency ratio''' tells you how many economically inactive people (0-15 and 65+) are dependent upon the economically active population (16 to 64).
The equation calculates a figure which shows the number of economically inactive people that are reliant on 100 economically active people. So a result such as 81.8 would mean that for every 100 economically active people there are 81.8 economically inactive people.

'''Life Expectancy in Rich Countries'''

•	Increasing is fast that half the babies born in 2007 we will live to be at least 104, and half the Japanese babies born that year will reach the age of 107
•	People could be living not only longer, but also better 
•	People are surviving chronic illnesses such as cancers and heart conditions, because they are being diagnosed earlier and receiving better treatment 
•	Shorter working weeks might further increase health and life expectancy
•	Over the 20th century there were huge increases in life expectancy – more than 30 years – in most developing countries  

'''Migration'''

PUSH

- Conflicts/War
- No job
- Lack of services
- Education
- Health
- Infrastructure
- Laws on movement
- Risk of hunger
- Lack of land
- Natural disasters

PULL

- Family
- Better services
- Education
- Health
- Infrastructure
- Employment

'''What is rural-urban migration?'''
Rural-urban migration is the movement of people from the countryside to the city. This causes two things to happen: 
1. Urban growth - towns and cities are expanding, covering a greater area of land.
2. Urbanisation - an increasing proportion of people living in towns and cities. Mega cities - those with over 10 million people.

'''When are death rates high?'''
Lack of clean water,
Lack of food,
Poor hygiene,
Contagious diseases,
Overcrowding,
Respiratory infections.

'''The population of China''', the world's most populous country, is projected to reach 1.39 billion by the end of 2015, with those age 60 or over topping 200 million people, said Li Bin, head of the country's top population policy agency.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This fact sheet will briefly outline appropriate continuous and interval training methods for men and women over 40 years old, and the benefits to health.

==Background==

Hypertension describes high blood pressure, classified by groups found in table 1 &lt;ref name=&quot;Eight&quot;&gt;Contractor, A.S. &amp; Gordon, N.F. 2009, &quot;Hypertension&quot; in Clinical exercise physiology, eds. J.K. Ehrman, P.M. Gordon, P.S. Visich &amp; S.J. Keteyian, 2nd edn, Human Kinetics, Australia, pp. 233-241. &lt;/ref&gt;.  This chronic condition has been reported to affect 29% of the Australian population with the risk of having hypertension rising sharply every decade after we are around 40 years old &lt;ref name=&quot;Three&quot;&gt;Barr, E.M., Magliano, D.J., Zimmet, P.Z., Polkinghome, K.R., Atkins, R.C., Dunstan, D.W., Murray, J.E. &amp; Shaw, J.E. 2006, AusDiab 2005 The Australian diabetes, obesity and lifestyle study, International Diabetes Institute, Melbourne. &lt;/ref&gt;.   Men and women over this age should have their blood pressure checked regularly as persistent hypertension is a risk factor for the development of life threatening heart, kidney and metabolic conditions &lt;ref name=&quot;Eight&quot; /&gt;.  Although hypertension is rarely a direct cause of death, it is a contributing factor in 10.6% of all male and 15.1% of all female deaths in Australia &lt;ref name=&quot;Two&quot;&gt;Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2010, Australia’s health 2010. Australia’s health series no. 12 cat. no. AUS 122, AIHW, Canberra. &lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

Fortunately, it is a treatable condition and medication, diet and exercise have all been shown to be effective at reducing blood pressure &lt;ref name=&quot;Eight&quot; /&gt;.  There are many ways to exercise but cardiovascular exercises are a great way to get outdoors, and can be done in many ways which suit your lifestyle.    Continuous and interval modes of exercises are both approachable and effective at treating hypertension &lt;ref name=&quot;Twelve&quot;&gt; Lamina, S. 2010, &quot;Effects of continuous and interval training programs in the management of hypertension: A randomized controlled trial&quot;, The Journal of Clinical Hypertension, vol. 12, no. 11, pp. 841-849. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fourteen&gt;Nemoto, K., Gen-no, H., Masuki, S., Okazaki, K. &amp; Nose, H. 2007, &quot;Effects of high-intensity interval walking training on physical fitness and blood pressure in middle-aged and older people&quot;, Mayo Clinic Proceedings, vol. 82, no. 7, pp. 803-811. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Twenty&quot;&gt; Wisløff, U., Støylen, A., Loennechen, J.P., Bruvold, M., Rognmo, Ø., Haram, P.M., Tjønna, A.E., Helgerud, J., Slørdahl, S.A. &amp; Lee, S.J. 2007, &quot;Superior cardiovascular effect of aerobic interval training versus moderate continuous training in heart failure patients&quot;, Circulation, vol. 115, no. 24, pp. 3086-3094. &lt;/ref&gt;.

==What are continuous and interval training?==

Continuous training describes an activity which is performed at a steady pace for the duration of that activity.  Interval training is the opposite; using short bursts of alternating high and low intensity levels throughout the duration of the activity &lt;ref name=&quot;One&quot;&gt;Abernethy, B., Hanrahan, S.J., Kippers, V., Mackinnon, L.T. &amp; Pandy, M.G. 2005, The biophysical foundations of human movement, 2nd edn, Human Kinetics, Australia&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Benefits of training==

Continuous and interval training methods may improve our health in a number of ways, including:
 
* '''DECREASING''' systolic and diastolic blood pressure &lt;ref name=&quot;Seven&quot;&gt;Ciolac, E.G., Guimarães, G.V., DīĀvila, V.M., Bortolotto, L.A., Doria, E.L. &amp; Bocchi, E.A. 2009, &quot;Acute effects of continuous and interval aerobic exercise on 24-h ambulatory blood pressure in long-term treated hypertensive patients&quot;, International Journal of Cardiology, vol. 133, no. 3, pp. 381-387.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ten&quot;&gt;Guimaraes, G.V., Ciolac, E.G., Carvalho, V.O., D'Avila, V.M., Bortolotto, L.A. &amp; Bocchi, E.A. 2010, &quot;Effects of continuous vs. interval exercise training on blood pressure and arterial stiffness in treated hypertension&quot;, Hypertension Research, vol. 33, no. 6, pp. 627-632.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Twelve&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fourteen&quot; /&gt;, especially in those with higher blood pressure &lt;ref name=&quot;Ten&quot; /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

* '''INCREASING''' quality of life &lt;ref name=&quot;Twenty&quot; /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

Research has shown interval exercises may be easier to approach for those with lower capacity to exercise &lt;ref name=&quot;Twenty&quot; /&gt;, and may also be more effective than continuous methods at:
* '''DECREASING''' systolic and diastolic blood pressure &lt;ref name=&quot;Twelve&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fourteen&quot; /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
* '''INCREASING''' exercise capacity &lt;ref name=&quot;Twelve&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fourteen&quot; /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
* '''INCREASING''' muscle strength in the elderly &lt;ref name=&quot;Fourteen&quot; /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

==Recommendations==

Depending on the mode of exercise you prefer both continuous and interval exercises are safe and appropriate for most people.  Aerobic exercises might include walking, jogging or cycling but could include any cardiovascular activity that you enjoy.  Table 2 found below shows how to approach and progress in your chosen mode of activity.  To find your desired intensity first calculate your max heart rate (HR) using ''220 - your age = maximum heart beats per minute''.  Desired intensity is then calculated using a percentage max HR in beats per minute &lt;ref name=&quot;Six&quot;&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2011, March 30-last update, Target heart rate and estimated maximum heart rate [Homepage of CDC], [Online]. Available: www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/heartrate.html [2011, October 12].&lt;/ref&gt;.  Heart rate can be measured using a personal monitoring device or one of the machines found at the gym.

==Considerations before starting exercise==

These training methods are suitable for most people over 40 years old &lt;ref name=&quot;Seven&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ten&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eleven&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nineteen&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Twenty&quot; /&gt;.  However, there are always some risks when starting a new exercise program and an initial physical assessment &lt;ref name=&quot;Seventeen&quot;&gt;Sharman, J.E. &amp; Stowasser, M. 2009, &quot;Australian association for exercise and sports science position statement on exercise and hypertension&quot;, Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport, vol. 12, no. 2, pp. 252-257. &lt;/ref&gt;, and monitoring can ensure there are no underlying issues that may prevent you exercising &lt;ref name=&quot;Nine&quot;&gt;Fletcher, G.F., Balady, G.J., Amsterdam, E.A., Chaitman, B., Eckel, R., Fleg, J., Froelicher, V.F., Leon, A.S., Pina, I.L. &amp; Rodney, R. 2001, &quot;Exercise standards for testing and training&quot;, Circulation, vol. 104, no. 14, pp. 1694-1740&lt;/ref&gt;.  An assessment is especially important if any of the following apply to you:
* '''High resting blood pressure:''' A resting blood pressure of &gt;180 mmHg systolic and &gt;110 mmHg diastolic blood pressure &lt;ref name=&quot;Seventeen&quot; /&gt;.
* '''Age:''' Men &gt;45 years and women &gt;55 years old with &gt;140 mmHg systolic and &gt;90 mmHg diastolic blood pressure  &lt;ref name=&quot;Seventeen&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nine&quot; /&gt;. 
* '''Sedentary lifestyle:''' Have little or no physical activity as part of your regular lifestyle &lt;ref name=&quot;Eighteen&quot;&gt;Thompson, P.D., Franklin, B.A., Balady, G.J., Blair, S.N., Corrado, D., Estes III, N.A., Fulton, J.E. &amp; Gordon, N.F., Haskell, W.L. &amp; Link, M.S. 2007, &quot;Exercise and acute cardiovascular events: placing the risks into perspective: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association Council on Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Metabolism and the Council on Clinical Cardiology&quot;, Circulation, vol. 115, no. 17, pp. 2358-2368. &lt;/ref&gt;.
* '''Medications:''' Beta blockers and diuretics can impede your ability to regulate temperature and engage in activity &lt;ref name=&quot;Seventeen&quot; /&gt;.
* '''Chronic conditions:'''  If you have an underlying long term condition which may affect your ability to participate in exercise &lt;ref name=&quot;Eight&quot; /&gt;.
During exercise it is important to wear cool, loose clothes and maintain adequate hydration 17, and avoid stopping exercise suddenly &lt;ref name=&quot;Nine&quot; /&gt;.. Cease exercise if you have an abnormal response, such as:
* Systolic blood pressure dropping  &gt;10 mmHg despite increasing exercise intensity &lt;ref name=&quot;Seventeen&quot; /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
* Systolic blood pressure only rises &lt;30 mmHg during exercise &lt;ref name=&quot;Seventeen&quot; /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
* Blood pressure exceeds &gt;250 mmHg systolic and &gt;115 diastolic blood pressure &lt;ref name=&quot;Seventeen&quot; /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
* You experience chest pain, heart palpitations or shortness of breath beyond expected 17 &lt;ref name=&quot;Seventeen&quot; /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Metric_system.png|The three non-metric countries: United States, Liberia, Burma (Myanmar)|thumb|500px|right]]

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system The Metric System] is a decimalized unit system used near globally.  The United States is the only non-metric industrialized nation. The focus of this chapter is on how the actions of interested parties have effected the adoption. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_metric_system A primer on the global history of the metric system can be found here].

==Political History==
[[File:JAKasson.jpg|John A. Kasson|thumb|150px|right]]
The history of the metric system in the United States can be traced to the Metric Act of 1866, signed by Andrew Johnson, which made legal the use of metric units in commerce. Congressman John Kasson, chairman of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, exemplified the positivity towards the adoption, hoping that &quot;a further act of Congress can fix a date for its exclusive adoption as a legal system&quot;. &lt;ref name = &quot;California Transition&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/laws/metric-act-bill.html |title=Text of Metric Act of 1866}} &lt;/ref&gt; In 1875, the United States attended the Metric Convention even though the nation had not converted.  The U.S. did however, sign the treaty, that created the International Bureau of Weights and Measures to regulate the metric system.&lt;ref name = &quot;USMA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gsi.nist.gov/global/docs/Omnibus.pdf |title=USMA}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 5, 1893, T.C. Mendenhall, the Superintendent of Weights and Measures, decided that the metric system would become the standard unit system in the U.S. and since then the American unit system has been defined in terms of the metric system.&lt;ref name = &quot;USMA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gsi.nist.gov/global/docs/Omnibus.pdf |title=USMA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, a bill supporting full conversion of the Federal government from U.S. Customary to the metric system was introduced to Congress.  The bill lost by a single vote.&lt;ref name = &quot;How soon?&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gsi.nist.gov/global/docs/Omnibus.pdf |title=Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early metrication efforts were high-minded, but little came of them.

In 1975 the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/94th_United_States_Congress 94th U.S. Congress] passed the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_Conversion_Act The Metric Conversion Act].  This bill created the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Metric_Board United States Metric Board] and initiated planning and preparation for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system metric system] conversion.  In 1988, President Reagan signed the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnibus_Trade_and_Competitiveness_Act_of_1988 Omnibus Foreign Trade and Competitiveness Act].  This bill required all federal agencies convert, &quot;to the extent economically possible&quot;, to the metric system by the end of the 1992 fiscal year, but disbanded the USMB. &lt;ref name = &quot;Omnibus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gsi.nist.gov/global/docs/Omnibus.pdf |title=Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988}} &lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 President [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H.W._Bush George H.W. Bush] signed [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order Executive Order] 12770, reiterating this requirement.  While some agencies did convert, the executive order stated that if conversion could &quot;cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to United States firms,&quot; the requirement was waived. Since this time there have been no further requirements for federal agencies or other groups to convert to the metric system. 

Recently, there have even been some political movements away from the metric system. In 2004, the California Department of Transportation initiated movements back to the customary system. In a letter to the department, acting chief engineer Mike Leonardo establishes a &quot;Metric to English Transition Team&quot; to help. He cites a benefits of aligning with commercial partners, in addition to 'long-term financial advantages to the department.' &lt;ref name = &quot;California Transition&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/oppd/design/metric-to-english-transition.pdf |title=Metric to U.S. Customary Units (English) Transition}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Proponents==
Proponents of U.S. metrication commonly cite the fact that the United States is the only industrialized country in the world that has not yet converted to the metric system.  By converting, it would unify measurement systems around the world and improve efficiency of international trade and commerce.  Currently, some industries in the United States do use the metric system.  These include the medical industry, sciences, and the military.

===Governmental Organizations===
The [http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/ United States Metric Association] was created to encourage the voluntary use and conversion to the metric system in the United States. &lt;ref name = &quot;USMA&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Created in 1916 as the American Metric Association, the USMA has been educating people about the metric system and advocating for its use.  It has worked closely with the United States Metric Board and the U.S. government proposing laws and studying metric system usage. &lt;ref name = &quot;USMA History&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/history.htm |title=A Brief History of the U.S. Metric Association (1916 to the 2000s)}} &lt;/ref&gt; The USMA attempted to personalize losses caused by unit confusions by publishing &quot;Metric Mixups.&quot; &lt;ref name = &quot;mixups&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/unit-mixups.html|title=Metric Mixups, USMA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implicit point of compiling the events is that if there were just one system, such accidents would not occur.

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Metric_Board United States Metric Board] was created by the Metric Conversion Act of 1975.  Its role was to facilitate the voluntary metric conversion by government agencies and other organizations.  By 1981 the USMB had produced TV public service announcements (PSAs) and 27 radio PSAs.  These PSAs served to encourage conversion to metric units.

One of the roles of the USMB was to publicize programs and allow interest groups to submit programs and comments on programs.  In 1981 the United States Metric Council submitted to the USMB two metric conversion plans for the shipping and billing of industrial chemicals and for instrument charts, scales, and mounting dimensions.  The USMB met to discuss each of these plans and voted to approve both.  The board passed two resolutions in accordance with these plans and stated in both that, &quot;This endorsement is not a mandate to proceed, since the USMB does not have such powers... The implementation of the plan is now a matter for decision by individual companies, organizations, and persons...&quot; &lt;ref name = &quot;USMB History&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/laws/usmb.html |title=History of The United States Metric Board}} &lt;/ref&gt;  By passing these resolutions, the board acknowledged beneficial plans, but could do nothing to actually implement the plans.

The American National Metric Council was established by the American National Standards Institute in 1973.&lt;ref name = &quot;USMA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/laws/anmc.html |title=American National Metric Council}} &lt;/ref&gt;  It was the view of the council that U.S. metrication was going to be a complex process involving hundreds of different organizations.  The council's role was to coordinate conversion efforts in order to ensure that the metric system was applied consistently.&lt;ref name= &quot;USMA&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The ANMC proposed two metric conversion papers to the USMB in 1981 and both were approved.  They also published two newsletters: the Metric Reporter, and Metric Messenger for Consumers.  The Metric Reporter included editorials, stories, and updates about the progress of metrication both in the government and private industries.  The Metric Messenger for Consumers was written for the general public and included various articles about the metric system and its usage.

==Opponents==

====Organized Groups====
The non-mainstream arguments are varied, but usually attempt to vilify the metric system or glorify the English units.  There have been attempts to associate the metric system with Dictatorial regimes, and thus shed English units in a more positive light:  &quot;Most Americans can remember, from the late 1970s, when U.S. metrication (metric conversion) was proceeding like a five-year plan commanded by the Kremlin.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Americans for Customary Weights and Measures&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bwmaonline.com/ACWM.htm | title = Americans for Customary Weights and Measures}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English units have been associated with being patriotic, which attempts to show opposition to the &quot;American&quot; units as being un-patriotic.&lt;ref name = &quot;Freedom2Measure&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freedom2measure.org/ | title = Freedom2Measure}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

====Popular Culture====
Pop culture media often presents metric conversion as being absurd and presents the topic as a joke, or to be humorous.  Grandpa Simpson presents the argument via song that the metric system is something to be opposed, and likens it to the Illuminati or Masons.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gandpa Simpson&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZI_aEalijE | title = Grandpa Simpson}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the T.V. show [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory The Big Bang Theory] the metric system is shown as something that only nerds and scientists care about.  Saturday Night Live has presented the base 10 quality as applied to an alphabet, or &quot;Decibet&quot;, a play on words originating from a metric prefix.&lt;ref name = &quot;Decibet Transcript&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/75/75rdecabet.phtml | title = Decibet Transcript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
The two main economic factors associated with US metrication are the cost of conversion and the cost of mistakes.
===Space Exploration===

Given that space flight is an increasingly international enterprise, it has received particular attention regarding its varied use of the metric and customary systems.

=====Mars Climate Orbiter=====

[[File:Mars_Climate_Orbiter_-_mishap_diagram.png|Intended vs. actual trajectories|thumb|250px|right]]

An expensive effect of metrication was the loss of NASA's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter Mars Climate Orbiter].  In 1999 NASA launched a probe to Mars, assembled with the assistance of multiple contractors.  Upon reaching Mars, it did not enter orbit, but entered the Martian atmosphere where it was destroyed.  A single contractor failed to abide by NASA's metric requirement.  This contractor used imperial pound-force rather than metric Newtons.  The resulting miscalculation of thrust led to the probe's destruction,&lt;ref name = &quot;NASA Mars&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msp98/news/mco991110.html | title= Mars Climate Orbiter Failure Board Releases Report, Numerous NASA Actions Underway in Response}} &lt;/ref&gt; a $327 million mistake. &lt;ref&gt;http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msp98/orbiter/fact.html title|title = Mars Climate Orbiter Fact Sheet |publisher = NASA / JPL&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Constellation=====

The Constellation Program,&lt;ref name = &quot;Constellation&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation_program | title = Constellation}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 2010 NASA project for human spaceflight, was granted permission to not be metric-compliant, for which NASA has received criticism&lt;ref name=&quot;NewScientist&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17350-nasa-criticised-for-sticking-to-imperial-units.html | title=NASA criticized for sticking to imperial units}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The primary reason for this was the $368 million&lt;ref name = &quot;NASA OIG&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nasawatch.com/archives/2010/03/nasa-oig-368-mi.html | title = NASA OIG}}&lt;/ref&gt; price tag required for contractors to convert all of the prior work and documentation to metric units.  After many years of regular business in U.S. customary units it is more difficult every day to perform the conversion to the metric system.

=====Lunar Base=====

The Vision for Space Exploration expects astronauts to return to the Moon by 2020 to set up a manned lunar outpost. NASA and 13 other space agencies discussed methods to coordinate their lunar exploration programs. The decision was unanimous to use metric units exclusively so that parts and supplies would be interchangeable between habitats. &lt;ref name = &quot;Metric Moon&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2007/08jan_metricmoon/ | title = Metric Moon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===
The medical community recognizes the need to switch to the metric system, but remains very dependent on English units. Paramedics calculate dosages completely in metric units, but doctors can prescribe drug dosages in any units they want. &lt;ref name = &quot;Paramedic Pharmacology&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhss.delaware.gov/dph/ems/files/pharmacology08.pdf | title = Paramedic Pharmacology}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been cases where patients have underdosed and overdosed because of unit mix-ups. Overdosed patients have been at risk for seizure, stroke and even death. In underdosed patients the original illness will not be prevented and may further progress.&lt;ref name = &quot;Medical Unit Mix-ups&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pharmacyerrorlawfirm.com/practice_areas/cvs-claims.cfm | title = Medical Unit Mix-ups}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conversion Opportunities===
Gasoline pumps offered a unique chance for metric conversion. Businesses were wary of having to retrofit their pumps to allow for gas prices greater than 99.9¢ per gallon. The USMB found that selling gas by the liter, would save $94 million dollars -- nearly $300 million 2012 dollars. Gas would not have exceeded $1/liter until the mid 2000's.

==Psychology==

===Path Dependence===
Citizens of the United States, especially the older generations, have spent lots of time working with English units. Complete conversion to metric units is viewed by these people to be a hassle. This is a case of path dependency. The United States is losing its dominance in world trade. Before, other countries were forced to convert to English units for trading, but now they are forcing the United States to convert to metric. This incentivizes businesses to convert to metric units to keep their trading partners. &lt;ref name = &quot;Why Hasn't the U.S. Gone Metric?&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/1999/10/why_hasnt_the_us_gone_metric.html | title = Why Hasn't the U.S. Gone Metric?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patriotism===
The United States is the only industrialized nation that has not converted to the metric system. Some researchers believe that patriotism is to blame. In a report by Kidela Capital Group, Jane McFadyen writes:

::“The United States breeds an almost unparalleled patriotic fever among its citizens, the likes of which is rarely found outside North Korea, and it is perhaps this strong sense of national pride and hint of superiority that prevents Americans from appearing to be the last to jump on the bandwagon.” &lt;ref name = &quot;The U.S. and the metric system&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kidela.com/columns/daily-debate/the-u-s-and-the-metric-system/ | title = The U.S. and the metric system}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patriotism stems from our need to honor our parents by being loyal to their nation. This can almost directly be related to English units; people think that they are honoring their parents by using English units. &lt;ref name = &quot;Patriotism&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/who-we-are/200907/patriotism | title = Patriotism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Currently, both the metric and English systems are taught in elementary school. Equal weight is given to both systems in textbooks. Since mostly English units are used by students at home, metric units are taught and then related to their equivalence in English units in school. Researchers believe that dual system usage causes students in the United States to perform poorly in math and science when compared to the rest of the world. &lt;ref name = &quot;Education System Benefits of U.S. Metric Conversion&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.richardphelps.net/Eval-Rev-1996-Phelps-84-118.pdf | title = Education System Benefits of U.S. Metric Conversion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computers are now reducing the need for fluency in both systems. With the click of a button, units can be converted back and forth. &lt;ref name = &quot;Solidworks Unit Conversions&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://help.solidworks.com/2012/English/SolidWorks/sldworks/t_dual_dims_measure_tool.htm | title = Solidworks Dual Unit Conversions}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Inventor Unit Conversions&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wikihelp.autodesk.com/Revit/enu/Community/Tips_and_Tricks/Project_Documentation/Tips | title = Inventor Dual Unit Conversions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalizable Lesson==
We've found that a system of measures is more than an a way to measure things. People have feelings and memories to their use of the customary system. Even its name embodies this link -- it is 'customary,' usual and friendly. Any program whose intent is to convert must take into account this emotional attachment, and navigate the waters carefully.

This is readily expandable into other social problems. In many situations, the technical community may agree on the benefits of some change, and want to implement it in society. To their chagrin, non-technical people oppose the shift. The technical community would do well to pay attention to the lesson that metrication can teach.

The United States is the last industrialized nation to convert to the metric system. Many communities in the United States have already converted to the metric system or are making attempts to do so as quickly as possible. Examples of such groups include scientists, the military and the medical community.  With the widespread use of computers it has become easy to quickly convert from one unit system to another using precise ratios established by scientific and governmental groups.  The United States government has tried to support conversion, but has not been successful for a variety of reasons.  There is a lack of popular support.  Rather than advertising the benefits of an international standard and the advantages to the average person, only tables of conversions were provided with groups willing to help conversion when assistance was requested.  A nation-wide conversion cannot occur without educating citizens and a strong government presence to oversee the process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== First Glance At Subatomic Particles ==

This lesson provides very basic information about protons, neutrons and electrons. If you think you are familiar with the concepts, move to the next lesson, ''From Big Bang to Atoms''.

[[File:Simple_atom_(lithium).png|thumb]][[File:Protium.svg|thumb|500px|A hydrogen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H) atom. It has one proton and one electron. Protons have positive charge. Electrons have negative charge]] Every substance around us is made from very small particles, called '''molecules'''. Each molecules contains several '''atoms'''. You can think atoms as balls. Many balls attached to each other make a molecule.

Inside an atom, there are even smaller 'balls', called protlons, neutrons and electrons. Protons and neutrons are attached to each other, making the '''nucleus''' of the atom. This nucleus oscillates very fast. Orbiting this nucleus are one or more electrons. Electrons are much smaller and lighter than protons and neutrons. The charge of an electron is -1.602 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-12&lt;/sup&gt; C. The charge of a protron is 1.602 x 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;. That's why electrons rotating around the nucleus. Neutrons have no charge.

Some information

|-
| Electron || e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; || 5.486 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; || -1
|}

e is the elementary charge, equals 1.602176565(35)×10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; C&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?e CODATA Value: elementary charge] &lt;/ref&gt; . A proton having a charge of one means its charge is one time the elementary charge.

m&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; is the atomic mass constant, equals 1.660 538 782(83)×10&lt;sup&gt;-27&lt;/sup&gt; kg. An electron having a mass of 5.486 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; means its mass is 5.486 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; times the atomic mass constant.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction to Elements ==

[[File:Periodic_table.svg|thumb|750px|Periodic Tabe of Elements]]An '''Element''' is a set of atoms that have the same number of protons in the nucleus. This number is called '''atomic number''', denoted as Z, from the first letter of the greatest Ancient Greek god Zeus. As of May 2011, 118 elements have been found.

An '''Isotope''' is a set of atoms that have the same number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. For example, Element '''Hydrogen''' (denoted as H) is a set of atoms that have one proton in their nuclei. This set has 3 subsets (Isotopes): '''Protium''' or '''Hydrogen-1''' (the first name is rarely used), '''Deuterium''' and '''Tritium'''. A protium is an atom that has one proton in its nucleus and no neutrons, while a deuterium not only has one proton but also 1 neutrons. In case of tritium, the number of neutrons is double: 2 neutrons in the nucleus.

In the context of this book, I use lower case for the reference to an object of a set, and use upper case for that set. For example, I use 'Deuterium' when I want to refer to a set of atoms that have one proton and one neutron in the nucleus, and use 'deuterium' when I want to refer to a single atom of the set. I use 'Isotope' for the reference to an Isotope, and 'isotope' to refer to an atom of that Isotope. The same thing for 'Element' and 'element'. Although the name of an element is considered as uncountable, in the scope of this book I use that name as a short-handed version for 'an atom of an Element'. For example 'an atom of Hydrogen' can be written as 'a hydrogen' in this book.

Another note is: every time you want to refer to element ''and'' you don't care about the different in the number of neutrons they have, use the Element's name in lower case. If you want to refer to an atom of a specific set of an element, use the Isotope's name in lower case. For example:

1) Water consists of hydrogen and oxygen (I don't care about the isotopes of Hydrogen and Oxygen)

2) A tritium has 1 proton and 2 neutrons in its nucleus (now I care!)

'''''Rule: upper case for set, lower case for object'''''

== Element Denotation ==

The following assumes you have already known the mass and charge of a proton, neutron and electron. If you don't know or you have forgotten, review lesson 1, [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Inorganic_Chemistry/First_Glance_At_Subatomic_Particles#First_Glance_At_Subatomic_Particles First Glance At Subatomic Particles]

Every Element has a symbol, usually the first letter of its name in English. Hydrogen is H, Oxygen is O, Nitrogen is N etc. This symbol also represents an element (an atom of an Element). A atom of Hydrogen is H, of Oxygen is O and of Nitrogen is N etc. This convention (using the same letter for an Element and an element) is particularly popular in chemical equations. As many other convention in science is not always convenient with all people, this one is not convenient with me since it violates my rule. Nevertheless, you can use any symbols you like as long as you understand the concept. Remember you are learning how the nature works, not how the scientists denote things :)

I use lower case all together when writing chemical equations to avoid confusion. But when I publish it, I use LibreOffice to switch them back to upper case :)

Okay, let's go back to our study. Instead of writing 'Protium', 'Deuterium' or 'Tritium', you can write &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H respectively. The '1', '2', '3' above the H to the left is the '''mass number''', denoted as A, which is the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Sometimes it can be called more appropriately as '''nucleon number'''. I prefer the second name, so I will use it throughout this book. This denotation is particularly useful to refer to an Isotope of an Element

Sometimes you can see the the atomic number (the number of protons in the nucleus) written below the nucleon number, as in &lt;math&gt;_1^{1}\text{H}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;_1^{2}\text{H}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;_1^{3}\text{H}&lt;/math&gt;. However, it is not necessary, because the 'H' has already told us that this is a set of atoms having one proton in the nucleus.

Again, the note comes in. When you see &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H else where apart from this book, it can mean a set of atoms or an atom.

== List of Elements ==

If we define atomic number as the number of protons an atom has in its nucleus, then atomic number should be applied to a specific atom, not a set of atoms. Therefore, the first column is named 'Atomic number of element'.

== Exercises ==

The following exercises help you utilize the concepts you have learned. Work through them yourself, try to think a way to tackle the problem.

# How many protons are there in the following atoms: h, fe, cu, al, n, o, c.
# How many neutrons are there in the following atoms: &lt;math&gt;^{4}\text{he}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;^{31}\text{p}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;^{130}\text{ba}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;^{23}\text{na}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;^{39}\text{k}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;^{19}\text{f}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;^{22}\text{ne}&lt;/math&gt;.
# Draw an illustration for each of the following atoms: &lt;math&gt;^{9}\text{be}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;^{24}\text{mg}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;^{25}\text{mg}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;^{26}\text{mg}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;^{32}\text{s}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;^{33}\text{s}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;^{35}\text{cl}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;^{37}\text{cl}&lt;/math&gt;. Assume electrons are on a same circle. Draw each proton, neutron and electron as a ball. 
# Specify the name of each of the following atoms. Because of the large atomic number. I draw all protons (and neutrons) as a big ball.

== Hints ==

# Look up the List of Elements to find the atomic number, which is the number of protons an element has.
# You see the nucleon number as a left superscript. Look up the List of Elements to find the atomic number. Since the nucleon number is the sum of particles in the nucleus, when you subtract it by the atomic number, you get the number of neutrons the atom has.
# First you need to look up the atomic number of an element. It is the number of protons the atom has. Subtract it from the nucleon number then you have the number of neutrons. Neutrons and protons make the nucleus of the atom. In normal stage, the number of protons equals the number of electrons in an atom. Draw electrons moving around the nucleus.

== Thinking ==

This session helps you build your critical thinking. Try to answer yourself, write it down a paper. The answers provided here are only a reference, there may be other answers as well. If you have another answer, feel free to add :)

# You know the atomic number is denoted as a Z. You also know why scientists choose that letter. But why is the nucleon number denoted as an A?
# Why are protons, neutrons denoted as p and n respectively?
# Why are electrons denoted as e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;?
# Can protons and neutrons be denoted as p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and n&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; respectively?
# In the scope of this book, what does an element and an isotope mean? What details are they different from?

== Answers to Thinking ==

# In convention, the atomic number is written as a subscript to the left of the Element's name, such as in &lt;math&gt;_1\text{H}&lt;/math&gt;. The nucleon number is written above it, such as in &lt;math&gt;_1^{1}\text{H}&lt;/math&gt;. Nucleon number is the above, atomic number is the below, just the same as 'A' is the first letter, 'Z' is the last. 
# They are denoted after their first letter.
# Electrons can be denoted as the letter e, just the same as the case of protons and neutrons. But latter the scientists found their anti-particles, called positrons. Positrons have almost the same characteristics as electrons, except for the charge. The charge of a positron over the elementary charge is +1, while in case of an electron, -1. Positrons were latter named e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, electrons e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
# Yes, I think protons can be denoted as p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; while their anti-particles, p&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;. But the neutrons would not. They have no charge, so '+' or '-' doesn't have any meaning. If they were ever denoted like that, there would be other reasons.
# An element is an atom of an Element. An isotope is an atom of an Isotope. When we say a hydrogen, we refer to an atom that may be a protium, deuterium or tritium. When we say a tritium, we only refer to an atom of Tritium.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Requiring or Prohibiting Heap-based Objects&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
* Require or prevent creation of objects on heap

=== Also Known As ===

=== Motivation ===
C++ supports different ways to create objects: stack-based (including temporary objects), heap-based, and objects of static storage duration (e.g., global objects, namespace-scope objects). Sometimes it is useful to limit the ways in which objects of a class can be created. For instance, a framework may require users to create only heap-based objects so that it can take control of the lifetime of objects regardless of the function that created them. Similarly, it may be useful to prohibit creation of objects on the heap. C++ has idiomatic ways to achieve this.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
'''Requiring heap-based objects'''

In this case, programmers  must use &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; to create the objects and prohibit stack-based and objects of static duration. The idea is to prevent access to one of the functions that are always needed for stack-based objects: constructors or destructors. Preventing access to constructors, i.e., protected/private constructors will prevent heap-based objects too. Therefore, the only available way is to create a protected destructor as below. Note that a protected destructor will also prevent global and namespace-scope objects because eventually the objects are destroyed but the destructor is inaccessible. The same is applicable to temporary objects because destroying temporary objects need a public destructor. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class HeapOnly {
  public:
    HeapOnly() {} 
    void destroy() const { delete this; }
  protected:
    ~HeapOnly() {}
};
HeapOnly h1;     // Destructor is protected so h1 can't be created globally
HeapOnly func()  // Compiler error because destructor of temporary is protected
{
  HeapOnly *hoptr = new HeapOnly; // This is ok. No destructor is invoked automatically for heap-based objects
  return *hoptr;
}
int main(void) {
  HeapOnly h2; // Destructor is protected so h2 can't be created on stack
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Protected destructor also prevents access to &lt;code&gt;delete HeapOnly&lt;/code&gt; because it internally invokes the destructor. To prevent memory leak, &lt;code&gt;destroy&lt;/code&gt; member function is provided, which calls &lt;code&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt; on itself. Derived classes have access to the protected destructor so &lt;code&gt;HeapOnly&lt;/code&gt; class can still be used as a base class. However, the derived class no longer has the same restrictions.

'''Prohibiting heap-based objects'''

Dynamic allocation of objects can be prevented by disallowing access to all forms of class-specific &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; operators. The &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; operator for scalar objects and for an array of objects are two possible variations. Both should be declared protected (or private) to prevent heap-based objects.


&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class NoHeap {
protected:
  static void * operator new(size_t);      // #1: To prevent allocation of scalar objects
  static void * operator new [] (size_t);  // #2: To prevent allocation of array of objects
};
class NoHeapTwo : public NoHeap {
};
int main(void) {
  new NoHeap;        // Not allowed because of #1
  new NoHeap[1];     // Not allowed because of #2
  new NoHeapTwo[10];  // Not allowed because of inherited protected new operator (#2).
}
&lt;/source&gt;
The above declaration of protected &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; operator prevents remaining compiler-generated versions, such as placement new and nothrow new. Declaring just the scalar &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; as protected is not sufficient because it still leaves the possibility of &lt;code&gt;new NoHeap[1]&lt;/code&gt; open. Protected &lt;code&gt;new []&lt;/code&gt; operator prevents dynamic allocation of arrays of all sizes including size one. 

Restricting access to the &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; operator also prevents derived classes from using dynamic memory allocation because the new operator and delete operator are inherited. Unless these functions are declared public in a derived class, that class inherits the protected/private versions declared in its base preventing dynamic allocation.

==Structure of Water==
1. A water molecule is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom&lt;ref&gt;Viadiu, Hector. &quot;Water.&quot; UCSD, 5 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Two lone-pair electrons from the oxygen atom make two lobes of negative density in the overall molecule&lt;br /&gt;
3. Large dipole moment—gives 33% ionic character to O-H bonds&lt;br /&gt;
4. Large polarizability&lt;br /&gt;
5. The H-O-H angle is 104.3 degrees&lt;ref&gt;Viadiu, Hector. &quot;Water.&quot; UCSD, 3 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quick Brief about the importance of the structure of water==

The structure of water contributes tremendously to its unique properties. Water has two Hydrogen atoms attached to an Oxygen atom give it some partial charges due to Oxygen's great electro-negativity. These partial charges are what make it possible for water to form hydrogen bonds.&lt;ref&gt;Viadiu, Hector. &quot;Water.&quot; UCSD, 3 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is also due to its bent shape, due to the two lone pairs of electrons, which allow it to have this dipole moment. If it was linear, then it would not contain a dipole because both individual dipole's would be pulling against each other, thus canceling. Thanks to the electron pairs and their repulsions, water is in a bent shape, and the polarity is allowed to exist.

==More about water molecule structure==

Water molecule is composed of one Oxygen and two Hydrogen atoms. Together with its two lone electron pairs, the Oxygen atom bonding to two Hydrogen atoms nearly forms a 3D tetrahedral structure. X-ray and neutron diffraction has been used to confirm liquid water tetrahedral structure.&lt;ref&gt;http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/1981/f1/f19817702053&lt;/ref&gt; The nearly tetrahedral structure of the orbitals around the oxygen atom allows one liquid water to form three Hydrogen bonds with four other water molecules. The Hydrogen bonds that are formed between a Hydrogen on one water molecule and the oxygen of another water molecule are not as strong as the covalent bonds between a hydrogen and oxygen atom on the same water molecule. Hydrogen bonds are longer and weaker than covalent O-H bonds&lt;ref&gt;Viadiu, Hector. &quot;Water.&quot; UCSD, 5 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== [[Nursing Study Guide/Further Reading]] ==

It is normal for books to have &quot;further reading&quot; sections at the end of the book, not on the title page (the additions you made make the book look like a Wikipedia article. If you are not familiar with Wikibooks try reading [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] for a useful background). Therefore I've moved all the content you added to its own chapter [[Nursing Study Guide/Further Reading]]. Thanks. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 14:22, 8 April 2012 (UTC)

It appears (from [[Make/Examples]]) that you've already figured out one answer to the question that you asked about &quot;looping directives&quot; at [[Talk:Make]].
How can we improve that Wikibook so it's easier for other readers to figure out how to do that?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bonjour.'''

Je me nomme Pierre-Henry. Né en 1936. J'habite dans les [[Bouches-du-Rhône]] ([[France]]). Je suis retraité ce qui me permet de passer beaucoup de temps en votre compagnie. C'est à la demande d'un de mes grands amis que je dois ma présence ici. Il s'agit du peintre [[Raphaël Toussaint]] qui désire figurer dans cette grande encyclopédie qu'est Wikipédia. J'ai donc commencé par créer son article et depuis, bien d'autres ont suivi. J'ai un net penchant pour les peintres chinois et japonais en particulier, mais tout autant pour les peintres de tous pays et toutes époques, étant plutôt bien documenté. Je suis inscrit depuis le 4 novembre 2009 à 15h38.--[[User:Colibrix|Colibrix]] ([[User talk:Colibrix|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Colibrix|contribs]]) 15:52, 25 October 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>Adding BookCat to uncategorised page</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm not sure if I should be so bold as to enter this, but I thought you would find it interesting...

I have used a number of Puredyne Bootable USB pens to run animation workshops. This allows me to turn any school computer lab, Library or other room full of computers into a Puredyne-powered media-lab for the duration of the event, and then leave, without any software or files remaining on the computers.

So far I have used this to run workshops using ToonLoop and Blender.  The results of these workshops are viewable [http://animation-workshop.co.uk/wiki/doku.php?id=buxton here] and [http://animation-workshop.co.uk/wiki/doku.php?id=blender here], but this will allow me to run workshops and lessons in a lot of powerful software packages, introducing open-source software to children and adults.

Puredyne allows me to install whatever software I need for the workshop, and collect any work created at the end of the day, to edit into a finished video. The fact that the interface looks very much like a certain operating system (only more elegant) makes it easy for my participants to pick up.

Thankyou to [http://access-space.org Access-Space] for their help in setting up my USB pens.
